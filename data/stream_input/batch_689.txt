B000002HMH|3.0|I was just thinking about the other day, what happened during the Load era of Metallica to make them do such an album? Well I think that I can explain alot of it, without making me or Metallica sound like total schmucks.<br /><br />First of all, I think Metallica has become more than just a band, its a MACHINE. A very lucrative machine for the persons involved that is. Its a very different world, somewhat isolated from the ground. I don't know what would have happened if they would've come out with a very eighties sounding album in 1997. Would it have sold? Considering how dead traditional metal was (other than in much of Europe, etc), I could see them getting dropped after lackluster sales of an album of such music. They may have had to been signed to Castle records, or in other words go from the \\"top\\" to the \\"middle\\" rung (see the Neil Strauss/Motley Crue book The Dirt for a good explaination of this concept).<br />Metallica have worked extremely hard to get where they are, and this is an indisputable fact regardless of what you think of their music.<br /><br />I don't think that Metallica were just following trends 100 % either, as Load isn't like Dokken's Shadowlife or such rubbish. Load is basically where they were at the time, getting into more bluesy influences, more hard rock, and a lot of Corrosion of Conformity!<br /><br />I think it was an experiment to expand their sound to include alot of different things, not to sell out to an expanded audience per se. However, I also think that the changed climate in the U.S in regards to metal was definitely an influence. Its been said that all trends start in California and I'm sure that Metallica were influenced by \\"alternative culture\\" that is inherent in San Francisco. Metallica wanted to branch out, but at the same time, sell albums (even if unconciously). I don't even think it was a conscious attempt to \\"Sell out\\" as much as it was following a certain path that is influenced by; approaching middle age, \\"Different\\" non metal influences, and also, even if under the surface, the influence of a corporation (the aforementioned \\"machine\\") and also peers and a city that has never been total metal like Gothenburg, Stockholm or Oslo (other than the bay area thrash scene of the Eighties).<br />Its the same reason why Madison WI's most famous \\"metal\\" band of all time is a more \\"alternative\\", \\"funky\\", or \\"trippy\\" metal band, Last Crack. So I take all this into consideration when looking at the Load's, the times were not conducive to traditional metal, but the scene where Metallica are from was not either, and their listening choices were probably not very \\"metallic\\" at the time. Lars Ulrich disowned the \\"metal\\" label around the same time, but he has always been the one to say provocative statements such as those. Lars seems to really hate alot of the fanbase he sees as unintelligent and unenlightened. It may be pretentious, but a part of me agrees with him, though making such statements is going to alienate people.<br /><br />I like the Loads, but they could have been made into one album, and it would have been a good album, though definitely not the Metallica of old.nd also, even if under the surface, the influence of a corporation (the aforementioned \\"machine\\") and also peers and a city that has never been total metal like Gothenburg, Stockholm or Oslo (other than the bay area thrash scene of the Eighties).

B000J3Q8U4|5.0|Following the hugely successful first Emmanuelle came this lushly photographed classic sequel, perhaps even surpassing the original. What it has in common with the first Emmanuelle: wonderful score, beautiful locations, and the lovely Sylvia Kristel. These are intelligent films with a sense of humour, much in the spirit of the novels the films are based on.<br /><br />Those looking for hardcore thrills will be let down, this is strictly R rated fare by todays standards... but if you are looking for a beautiful world of fantasy and desire, this is the film for you.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|I'm sorry, but I am completely puzzled as to how this film is getting even par reviews. I went to the theaters to see this when it first cam out, knowing that I am a Nicholas Cage fan and a HUGE lover of the character Ghost Rider.<br /><br />The outcome was astonishing--In a VERY bad way! First of all, the acting rediculously abismal, even by Mr. cage--but especially by the fellow that played Blackheart. The only standout actor was the fellow that played Johnny Blaze's best bud, by which some decent comic relief was provided. Some of the special effects were great, but alot of them were also too cartoonish. Ghost rider was a very serious character and they made him out to act like a more pissed off version of Spider Man! Maybe the role's first intended star, johnny Depp, could have saved this film...but it's too late for that.<br /><br />Don't Waste Your Money Buying This! Rent it first and then decide.<br /><br />Top Comic Book Movies in my eyes as of right now-Sin City, Batman Begins, Blade (1-3), and The Punisher (remake starring Tom Jane).
B000PMGS8G|4.0|The Special Feature that must happen is the one where Queen's soundtrack is the only thing you hear.  Including each time it is used to \\"hear\\" movement.  That soundtrack is beyond amazing.    The movie itself is a tribute to how special effects were done prior to the advent of computers.  Why not a featurette on how these techniques were done?  Interviews with the various actors, the costumer, etc. would also be wonderful.  The costumes were amazing!  An inspiration to any costumer.    I have the Region 2 DVD and am very happy with it.

I liked the movie, but i loved the series.  GREAT CAST, good characters, great story, and funny.  Great for anyone, not just sci-fi watchers.
068485743X|4.0|If you thought about being a novelist, are trying to be a novelist, or are a novelist, Noah Lukeman's THE FIRST FIVE PAGES is a book you should read. Many books on writing exist. Lukeman's approach is to tackle the mistakes that editors find in the first five pages that will immediately cause a book to be rejected. Editors are cramped for time and read tons of manuscripts. Regardless of your writing skills, editors will reject your manuscript if can't master the basics.<br /><br />There are 19 chapters in the book, each devoted to a specific area of writing. It opens with presentation. If your proposal is sloppy, you don't stand a chance. Next are things like adjectives and adverbs (try to use a more powerful verb instead), avoid cliched comparisons, and write in a style that fits your story. There are five chapters on dialogue. If you tend to write the way peopel talk, you'll be rejected. Too boring. For example, readers don't want to read the \\"Hi, Hello, How are you\\" that begin most conversations. Also, dialogue shouldn't be used to explain plot points.  The last part of the book covers other topices such as showing vs. telling, viewpoint, characterization and hooks. On hooks, most writers know you must hook your reader at the beginning. But that hook must not be out of place. It must fit within the rest of the novel.<br /><br />If you're new to writing, this book will teach you a lot, but it won't make you a good writer at all. You become a good writer by immersion. You must constantly write and read in order to recognize the issues that Lukeman covers in his novel. This is a great book because it covers writing topics that MUST be learned. To be a good writer, you must continually study the craft, continue to write, continue to seek out feedback. This is great book to add to your library of writing references. If you can master what Lukeman covers, you just might get past the rejection pile.
B000000H7I|3.0|The New York death metal scene during the late eighties and up until about '91 or '92 was basically comprised of five or six guys. In other words it didn't have the same scene that central and south Florida enjoyed during this time. And unlike fellow Immolation from Yonkers, Suffocation hadn't been around for that long before offering the 1990 \\"Reincremated\\" demo and the \\"Human Waste\\" EP. The fact that the band hadn't quite solidified their sound comes across in this record. Don't get me wrong it sounds incredibly professional and well rehearsed before the recorded fact (the sound/production quality is much improved compared to \\"Human Waste\\".) It's just that some of the repetition quickly becomes daunting.    From the first track, \\"Effigy\\" comes off as a brutal record with heavy guitars, a heavy yet inaudible bass, a vocalist with a range that matches the low end of the bass guitar, and drumming that's as simple as it can get. Frank Mullen's vocals aren't quite of the \\"cookie monster\\" variety. In fact, they're quite in their own dimension. I'd call these \\"constipation\\" vocals because it often sounds like Mullen is trying to pass a brick. Like the vocals or not, this style of vocal delivery is probably the second most copied style next to the \\"cookie monster\\" vocals. The bass is basically inaudible so doesn't deserve comment since I can't hear what is being playing. The drumming is about as one dimensional as drumming can get. Mike Smith's drumming consists of double time thrashing and medium paced blast beats (which contrary to popular belief are not difficult to play since all the limbs are doing the same thing.) The drums take down this album a notch. But the one gem to this album is the duo guitar work of Doug Cerrito and Terrance Hobbs. This is something that would get even better with later albums but what is showcased here is pretty good even if it isn't their best work.     The main problem here is this album ain't technical and there is little variance to the songs so only the amazing riffs begin to distinguish songs from each other. If you're new to Suffocation I'd start with \\"Pierced from Within\\" and work backwards. Otherwise this album is solid, mainly for it's guitar work and deserves to be listened to along with all the other early 90s Death Metal landmark releases.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I must admit, I'm a pretty big Blind Guardian fan. I took a risk in early 1998 and bought an expensive 30 dollar import from an online retailer (this was 4 or 5 months before Nightfall came out, and a full year and a half before they were even SOLD in the U.S!), that being Tales from the Twilight World, and was hooked.<br /><br />However, that would not prepare me for what is possibly the greatest album ever, the best (metal) concept album ever (other than Mindcrime) and the greatest symphonic metal album ever, Nightfall in Middle Earth.<br /><br />You see, the newer Blind Guardian albums don't have such as scope as this, and don't sound half as organic. I think that they lost something after this album, which is likely their peak.<br /><br />Its epic metal for the person who hates stuff like Rhapsody, its progressive metal for those who hate progressive metal (not me, but just a statement I'm trying to make). What really seperates Blind Guardian from the various \\"epic metal\\" and \\"Symphonic Metal\\" bands is EMOTION. Hansi Kursch really sounds like he is struggling when a character in a song is struggling, he sounds exalted when the character is exalted. Fabio Leone and others sound like robotic Kiske clones compared to this.<br /><br />There is a rough edge to Blind Guardian that makes the competitors sound like mere competitors. Its the element that makes Emperor's symphonic majesty tower over stuff like Dimmu Borgir, and so on.<br /><br />I would like to say its the fact that the band is still very riff oriented underneath all the bombast but thats not it. Its this human element, this imperfection that makes the band so powerful. They layer on guitar after guitar to rival Queen but its still not perfect, its whats going on between the notes that's just as important. And Blind Guardian understand this, they make music with melody, emotion, and POWER. Also, another thing that makes them the best in this Genre is the fact that they still have a soulful 70's element brought in from Prog rock and 70's metal that makes it sound unique compared to symphonic bands that just shred away for 50 minutes. Its this sometimes pentatonic scaling that gives it a bit more \\"soul\\" I would say. Plus when the guitars kick in, they're almost as heavy as thrash, something you can't say about a band such as say, Fairyland. Acoustic guitars and flutes sure help among the choir vocals.<br /><br />Blind Guardian plays what is a normally very cheesy type of music topically and musically with panache, passion, and a dark atmosphere. This is another thing that makes them tower over their competitors.<br /><br />The best album of all time? Its certainly up there. The Queen meets Queensryche meets Rage (german band) meets a group of medieval<br />bards is intact, but it is also so much more.

B00000DR5I|4.0|Rubycon is a tremendous improvement over the previous year's \\"Phaedra\\". Tangerine Dream seem to have gained mastery over their instruments and they let loose with every sound in their electronic arsenal.    Both tracks begin with synth washes thay convey a sense of eeriness and then pure wonderment and joy. After a while, the sequencers kick in and sound upon sound is layered together to form a chaotic yet controlled composition. At various intervals, synth voices seem to well up out of nowhere and explode into oblivion. Both tracks evoke a sense of urgency and profound ambience.    Please, by all means, add this album to your TD collection.
B000P2A24W|4.0|Much has been made about this being Bon Jovi's \\"country\\" album, which is either a good or bad thing depending on how you look at such departures from norm for artists.  If you love the recent crop of country-tinged pop that has invaded the charts over the last several years, then the melding of Bon Jovi's arena rock anthems and their working-class lyrics with a few more country instruments seems like a no-brainer.  If you're like me and can't stand the Rascal Flats and Carrie Underwoods of today's music scene then you probably are approaching this release with a fair amount of skepticism.  Yes, its true that Bon Jovi's lyrics over the years - and often their sound when they focus more on acoustics and balladry rather than the pop-metal of staples like \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" and \\"Bad Medicine\\" - can fit the country mold (what, after all, are tracks like \\"Someday I'll Be Saturday Night,\\" if not juiced-up country tunes?), but if you're like me you prefer them as rockers, and while crossover tunes like \\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\\" are fun experiments that break up their usual rock anthems and ballads over the course of an album, you really weren't asking for an entire album of such tunes.    The good news for us skeptics is that this isn't much more of a country album than \\"... Saturday Night\\" and \\"... Can't Go Home\\" are country songs.  Sure there are a host of instruments - steel guitars, fiddles, violins, etc - the band doesn't normally employ that lend a distinct country flavor to the songs; and many of the lyrics riff on kitschy, only-in-country-music themes,  but most of the stops on this highway are still closer to Jersey than Nashville.  The term country/rock really is appropriate, since fans of each sound are likely to find something here worth while.  And even those like me who are usually really against one of these genres are likely not to be too bothered by its influence here.  That said, this is not among the best Bon Jovi albums; don't look for any \\"Livin' on a Prayer\\"-sized classics, but it is a tight batch of songs that is plenty listenable, and the boys not only avoid what could have been an embarrassing foray towards courting an audience they have no business reaching for, but they actually pull it off.      Mostly.    The title track is probably the best of the bunch and will fit well in the band's song cannon.  It is the kind of tune that could drop the country instruments, add harder guitars and turn it into a true blue rock jam, especially with that fist-pumping chorus.  Actually, the first four tracks are all decent rockers.  First single \\"(You Want to) Make a Memory\\" is admittedly slower, but it works well weaved between the other three tunes, and it's the kind of song that some may accuse of being either too slow, too sappy, or too typical and cheesy, but after the fourth or so time spinning it, I gotta say, it grows on you as a great ballad.  There is more going for it than one might notice on the first listen.  \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Leavin'\\" are very Bon Jovi-esque, but again, as with the title track, there is that country pitter-patter running through them that may have some fans wishing they were performed as straight-ahead rockin' Bon Jovi tunes.  Still, this is what we signed up for when we purchased this album, and as such they rank among the album's better tracks.      \\"We Got it Goin' On\\" however, which features, and was co-written with, Big and Rich, is a rock and country hodge-podge (rather than successful hybrid) that comes off as something of a mess.  While the lyrics work as the boastful fun they are no doubt intended to be and the song is bouncier than maybe any other track here, the song plays into the worst devices of both contributing artists:  There goes Richie with his squawk-box ala \\"Livin' on Prayer,\\" \\"It's My Life\\" and a dozen other Bon Jovi anthems, there's Jon talkin' about how rockin' he and the band are, and there is Big and Rich's obvious lyrics, lame metaphors, andbombastic, bass-heavy beats.  I will admit this though:  this is a song that could become a guilty pleasure after the listener hears it a few times, even in spite of its clichéd elements.  Some will no doubt find it undeniably catchy.  Also, I predict this will be the song on the album that kicks off their live shows for the upcoming tour.  On every new tour the band picks a rave-up track from the most recent album to kick off the show, usually as a preamble to \\"You Give Love a Bad Name,\\" and like \\"Last Man Standing\\" from \\"Have a Nice Day,\\" the title track from \\"Bounce,\\" and \\"One Wild Night\\" from \\"Crush\\" before it, \\"We Got It Goin' On\\" seems like a perfect way to get `em jumping on the \\"Lost Highway\\" tour, no matter the mediocrity of the song itself.    And that is the thing about this album.  You can see much of it working even better live - as true Bon Jovi songs, instead of just a country-blend experiment.  Intertwined with the classics, much of this is bound to come more alive.  Another song that falls into this category is \\"I Love This Town.\\"    The band has said another reason for swaying towards country with this album was to be able to show off their song writing skills and tell stories of deeper meaning.  It is ironic then that nothing here rivals stories such as Tommy and Gina's from the bands more bombastic days.  Also, there is no need to go country in order to tell great stories or show off your talent for penning stirring lyrics.  Springsteen, Dylan and other terrific rock writers were able to connect with audiences just fine.  It becomes clear around track 7, 8 and 9, that what Bon Jovi means when they say they want their song-writing and storytelling skills to shine through the rock, what they really mean is they want to write ballads without worrying about fans who might buy a new album and be ticked-off that there are too many slow songs and not enough \\"Lay Your Hands on Me.\\"  \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore\\" with Leann Rimes would probably makefor an obvious - and even successful - radio single, but it is the last thing I need to hear more of from Bon Jovi.  Actually, the entire middle section of this album (tracks 7 - 11) more or less just goes the power-ballad route (which they have been doing more and more of  lately - \\"Bounce\\" and \\"Have a Nice Day\\" were about a quarter ballads, whereas there used to be only two or three per album).  They all sound fine:  polished musically, Jon's smooth vocals, but they aren't very exciting and it is the sort of thing that has become very predictable from this band.    So all and all, the first half warrants repeat listening, the second half is plenty listenable, though it starts to feel repetitive.  But nothing here is bad.  And the songs I found tired, fans of ballads and/or country music will probably love.  And as with every Bon Jovi album, the highpoints and songs that warrant repeat listening far outweigh the lesser moments.  The boys could be accused of just jumping on the country/pop bandwagon just to sell more albums (which no doubt plays a part in this projects origin), but listening to some of the more skillfull tunes here, you realize they were never really that far from this; especially if you're like me and count the criminally under-rated \\"These Days\\" among their best works (maybe not from a classic, anthem standpoint, but definitely from a writing and introspective one).      FYI:  Buy it at Target and get two bonus tracks (one of which, \\"Walk Like a Man,\\" is pretty good).  Walmart includes a DVD with rehearsal footage (though it is more expensive there and you can catch the same footage online).
B000FQWGAQ|4.0|Although this album is a sentimental favorite of mine, the packaging is a bit odd. Inside the cardboard sleeve is a paper envelope with a sealed flap, as you would expect to find on a software package. The gummed seal makes reuse of this inner envelope difficult. The included insert is a history of Renaissance, rather than the original lyric sheets - possibly because the lyric sheet would have required an additional license fee. NOT IMPRESSED!
B000001FTQ|4.0|The live version of \\"Bad\\" is my pick for the best thing U2 has ever released.  It's an utter revelation, far surpassing the studio version in immediacy and power.  The other live track is a worthy version also, much different than the atmospherically-rendered studio version of \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\", though not necessarily better.<br /><br />The two studio tracks are worthwhile for U2 fans, and are better than some of the songs that actually made it to The Unforgettable Fire album. \\"Three Sunrises\\" mixes 60-ish psychdelic pop with some more aggressive signature-U2 touches, while the final track \\"Love Comes Tumbling\\" is a little too mumbly-morose for my taste, but is a nicely crafted song nonetheless.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|You are going to see a lot of negative reviews for this album. There are a ton of fans out there who fell in love with QOTSA via [[ASIN:B00000AGA0 their debut]] and [[ASIN:B00004TH6O R]]. They believe that the Queens have been going steadily downhill since R, and that, coupled with their newfound mainstream success, doesn't leave a lot of people overly happy with what the Queens have been putting out there. Now, I am one of those fans whose favorite two albums are their debut and R, and I also believe that they lost a little something with [[ASIN:B00006F83Y Songs For The Deaf]] and [[ASIN:B0007QJ1MK Lullabies To Paralyze]] (namely, Nick Oliveri). However, Era Vulgaris is a step forward for the band, and, quite possibly, as close to the days of R as they are going to get. Another reason people may be sour on this album is that a lot of the \\"good\\" songs on Era were released before the album came out; \\"3's & 7's\\", \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\", \\"I'm Designer\\", and \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" were all available through various blogs or even QOTSA's website (there was also the title track, \\"Era Vulgaris\\", which is not on the album, but was quite popular). The first few times I listened to this album I didn't find much to get excited about; I, like so many others, had already heard most of the better tracks, and was seemingly let down. But you have to look at the full album. And as a full album, Era Vulgaris is great.<br /><br />I don't want to say it's \\"underrated\\" since the Queens are so popular, but it is better than most are making it out to be. And, I feel, it is better than their preceding two albums. It is at times haunting, dark, but always catchy and smart, both lyrically and musically. It starts with the ironical \\"Turnin' On The Screw\\", a heavy tune with scathingly soothing lyrics (e.g., 'the jury's in / verdict: retarded') and some catchy 'do do do's. It is a fine opener. Next there is the first single, \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\". Any Queens fan should love this one, as it's pretty universal. \\"I'm Designer\\" is essentially the same way. It is my personal favorite song on the album, and the lyrics are fantastic throughout. You have to love witty lines like 'the thing that's real for us is fortune and fame / all the rest seems like work'. That is essentially what this album is all about: selling out while keeping a good, sarcastic attitude. \\"Into The Hollow\\" is one of the few songs I don't really care for, along with \\"River In The Road\\"; both seem to get caught between wanting to be a slow song and wanting to be heavy. \\"Misfit Love\\", however, is quite fantastic. The opening drums and riffs are excellent, and, true to form, it is mysteriously catchy throughout (it reminds me of a faster \\"You Would Know\\"). \\"Battery Acid\\" is very heavy, and as you will see, the name fits the bill. \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", of course, has been around for a long time, dating back to the Desert Sessions days. It has been a concert staple for the band of recent, and I think it breaks up the acidic flow of the album quite nicely. It is basically the same as the original, albeit a tad more polished. \\"3's & 7's\\", I believe, was the first album track to leak. I loved it when I first heard it; I must've listened to it 100 times. And there are still days when I crave the catchy guitar riffs of it. \\"Suture Up Your Future\\" is another slower track; it starts rather weakly, but picks up as the pounding drums pick up. The closing track, \\"Run, Pig, Run\\", is a bit different than all QOTSA's other closers. Each of their other albums ended with a slow, ballad-type track (I might make the argument that \\"Running Joke\\", an Era b-side, should've been the closer, but I don't necessarily think Era Vulgaris is too short of an album); here, the closer is rather heavy. Much like with \\"3's & 7's\\", there is a certain guitar riff that catches my attention. Other than just that, though, it is the perfect closer for this type of album.<br /><br />Again, you are probably going to see a lot of reviews for Era Vulgaris that say it pales in comparison to what most people believe are Queens Of The Stone Age's masterpieces, either R or their self-titled debut. It does, probably, pale in comparison, but the sooner you submit to the fact that there will never be another R, the sooner you can fully enjoy Era Vulgaris. I do believe this album is a step up from their previous two studio releases, however (which were by no means \\"bad\\" releases--they were both good in their own rights), and depending on how much time you need to decide whether or not you like or love an album, there is a greater chance that you will learn to love Era Vulgaris. As Homme says in \\"Misfit Love\\", 'if you bet on me, you've won'. So give it a shot.<br /><br />Footnote: And if nothing else, check out the plentiful b-sides that paralleled the release of this \\"Era\\"; we got an official release of the studio version of \\"The Fun Machine Took A Shxx & Died\\", an Elliott Smith cover, a Tom Waits cover, and, ironically enough, the great title track (plus a few more).pales in comparison to what most people believe are Queens Of The Stone Age's masterpieces, either R or their self-titled debut.

0783204914|2.0|There are basically two ways to see this film.  The sentimental fan of classic Hollywood sees it as an inspiring, uplifting story with a feelgood ending.  The fan of realism and originality sees it as a predictable and formulaic cliche.  The sentimental fan of classic Hollywood sees Al Pacino's performance as colorful, facinating, and larger than life.  The fan of realism and originality sees Pacino's performance as over the top and lacking in any subtlety.  The fan of classic Hollywood sees Pacino's closing speech and the ending of the film as inspiring and heartwarming.  The fan of realism and originality sees the speech as a lame moralization and the ending as well as Pacino's character transformation to be a phony and unrealistic sellout to popular sensiblity.    If you are looking for the familiar crowd-pleasing kind of entertainment that Hollywood has always been trusted to provide, you will definitely find it here.  But if you are a fan of artistic cinema you will wonder how Al Pacino could win an oscar for a role like this in a film like this and somehow not win for Godfather II.  In fact, you will probably wonder what Pacino, as a dedicated method actor with such a great vision for playing complex and interestingly subtle characters, was thinking when he played this role.
B00003CWN3|4.0|I don't really know how \\"accurate\\" the film is in portraying the main character. Apparently there was some sort of controversy over this. I think it doesn't matter that much: it's a feature film, not a biography. Of course it stylizes its characters. Complaining about this just distracts from the substance of the film.    So, I don't know what Teena Brandon was really like. But, in the director's interpretation, she is a deeply confused and helpless person, the scatterbrained type who doesn't quite understand the world around her. She doesn't really know what to do with her life, she has no plan and nothing to look forward to. However, she is very imaginative, and invents a detailed biography for herself. She also calls herself Brandon Teena and attempts to pass herself off as a man, but she also fabricates other parts of her life that don't deal with her gender. For instance, she tells the other characters that she has a child, with no prompting on their part. She doesn't tell lies \\"on purpose,\\" it's more like she needs to believe them herself. Her \\"sexual identity crisis\\" (her words, and she says them like she doesn't quite know what they mean) is part of a much larger, more general \\"identity crisis.\\"    She commits theft, but she is essentially harmless to society. If she could find some kind of direction in life, she might find it easy to live normally, unlike the characters John and Tom, who really are genuine criminals, incapable of living any other way and unwilling to try. But more than anything, Brandon wants to be loved and accepted, instinctively. It doesn't really matter by whom. Consequently, she enters dangerous territory without understanding the risk to herself.    Long after the audience has realized that Brandon should leave town as soon as possible, she stays. Even after the first assault, it still seems like she doesn't understand her situation. Some critics complained about this aspect of Brandon's character, but I think it gives an air of genuine tragedy to the film. It's almost as if her fate is forcing her to stay.    The film reminded me a lot of Gus Van Sant's \\"My Own Private Idaho,\\" which is also about a lonely drifter who is stuck in a desolate region and craves love more than anything else. \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is much better, because it lacks Van Sant's Shakespearean pretensions. But like Van Sant's film, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is best at appearances. The script is barely there. Half the film just wanders through dingy trailers, houses, bars and convenience stores, with convincingly forgettable dialogue. Most scenes are shot at night, usually indoors, so nature is totally absent. There's very little exposition. We don't really learn anything about the characters, but this is perfectly accurate. There is nothing to learn about them, and there's really nothing interesting that they could talk about.     But we can look at their faces, which are all chosen very well for the roles. Chloe Sevigny, as Lana, is immediately recognizable. Every suburb or small town has a girl like this, with a sullen face and a deliberately abrasive attitude intended to conceal her naivete. Every other face in the film is just as archetypical.    There is a moment of foreshadowing early in the film when John first encourages Brandon to drive over the speed limit, and then threatens her after they get pulled over by police. The impulsive, unreasoning way he goes from friendly to hostile is all the more frightening because it's so unexpected. When he finds out about Brandon's gender, he screams his disgust, but his anger is motivated more by \\"traditional\\" sexual jealousy. He would have assaulted a male rival also. But another man, especially one similar to John, might have been able to defend himself, whereas Brandon's gender and personality combine to make her uniquely vulnerable and defenseless, and this is the saddest thing about the story.    I do have a few problems with the film. It's very noticeable that all of the men in the film are vile and callous, not just John and Tom, but also the cops and the guys in the bar. At the same time, all of the women are basically sympathetic, not just Lana, but also her friend and even Lana's mother. Even if the women feel disgusted at Brandon's cross-dressing at first, they quickly come to support her. But the men never feel any remorse or sympathy, just rage and fear, and they blindly victimize everyone. I guess I can accept this in these particular characters, but still, I wonder about the director's intent.    The inevitable, brutal ending drags on for about half an hour, long after the conclusion becomes obvious. And the very last scene has a screaming toddler for maximum gut-wrenching effect. These lurid scenes may be manipulative (a similar scene in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is effective but occurs much more quickly), but there is also something believable in them. These men don't know anything that might inspire them to listen to reason or to feel compassion. It is hopeless to beg them for mercy.    I also don't quite believe the tender love scene between Lana and Brandon right after the first assault. The director includes it for pathos, to make the audience hope for their salvation, and to underscore how happy they might have been. But I'd suppose that right after such a terrifying experience, one would be too severely traumatized to express one's passion.    But, for most of its duration, the film is perceptive and believable, with a sympathetic and tragic heroine undone by circumstances that are too much for her to handle. The film is well in keeping with the tradition of American stories about marginal youth. If you like that subject, or if you are willing to consider watching a film about it, \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" is a good choice.

B000FVNX2Q|2.0|The build of the Platinum Anniversary 12C itself felt good. However,  try this operation (i.e. multiplying -10 by 2) by punching keys in the  following 3 sequences (in the RPN mode):    1) 10 ENTER CHS 2 [X] gives 20.00 and not -20.00.  2) 10 CHS ENTER 2 [X] gives the correct answer of -20.00.  3) 10 ENTER CHS ENTER 2 [X] gives the correct answer of -20.00.    I verified with John Tirone (the author of the book \\"Professional Real  Estate Problem Solving Using the HP12C\\") that if the same key  sequences are punched on the black/gold 12C, it consistently gives the  correct answer of -20.00.    Needless to say, I returned the Platinum Anniversary 12C for this  reason and purchased the black/gold 12C instead.

B00005JPQP|3.0|Ocean's Thirteen brings back a star-studded cast headed by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, and Matt Damon.  They are once more backed by Elliott Gould, Don Cheadle, Shabao Qin, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Bernie Mac, and Carl Reiner in great support roles.<br /><br />As always, Danny Ocean (Clooney) co-leads with Rusty Ryan (Pitt) in a deadly, dangerous, and twisting con scheme. In the previous two movies, Ocean, Ryan, and the others have always been motivated by personal desires as well as financial ones. This time it's more personal. Reuben (Gould) has been beaten out of his fortune by Willie Bank (Al Pacino), who is planning to open the most impressive casino in Las Vegas.<br /><br />Willie Bank (And don't you just love the subtle name?  Will he bank?) has already been a successful casino owner/operator. All of his casinos before have earned the \\"Five Diamonds Award\\" of excellence. Bank expects no less this time. And he shut Ruben out of the deal so than the glamour - not to mention the profit - can all be his.<br /><br />Ocean and Rusty gather with the rest of the crew to pay their respects to Reuben and figure out what they are supposed to do to get their friend's fortune back. Reuben appears to have lost the will to live. As an act of courtesy, Ocean offers Bank a Billy Martin: a chance to redeem himself on his own and give the money back to Reuben. Of course if Bank had accepted the proposition the movie would have been much shorter.<br /><br />So Ocean and his team go to work. The con to get Reuben's money back is complicated and involves a lot of details. Some of it is realistic, but much of it lies in the realm of fantasy. Still, these movies are confection and are to be enjoyed just on their own.<br /><br />And they are probably also an excuse for the high-powered stars to get together and play.<br /><br />In Ocean's Eleven the mix was exactly right. The stars matched the story, and each of those stars got the chance to be an absolute scene-stealer.  The franchise stumbled badly in Ocean's Twelve because the movie seemed to lack a central focus. Some viewers even stated that the film had no plot at all.<br /><br />The plot in the latest film is apparent from the earliest scenes, but it seems like Clooney, Pitt, and the others are merely going through the paces, hitting their marks and delivering lines of dialogue that are often funny, but too often wide of the mark.  The story isn't as tight as the first one.<br /><br />In order to explain the premise of the con to the audience, Ocean and Ryan have to describe what they've got in place to a new con man that specializes in computer technology. He supposedly is the best at figuring out cybernetic systems. Bank's new casino is protected by an artificial intelligence. Which seems weird because the military evidently doesn't have those yet. And the fact that it's an artificial intelligence is never exploited in the film. It's just one of those near science fiction explanations to make the job supposedly harder.<br /><br />Part of the plan involves manufacturing dice made of a special polymer. One of the team (Affleck) goes undercover at the Mexican manufacturing plant where they're made to get the special polymer into the mix. While he's there, he ends up taking part in a mini-revolution of blue collar workers against white collar administration. This is truly one of the funnier bits in the film, but it feels a little out of place. It's a diversion that doesn't fit in with the Las Vegas scene that's going on. And even the special dice are not showcased that much later in the film.<br /><br />Moving the franchise back to Las Vegas seems to be a good idea, though. There's something about this city that just makes magic for these kind of shows.<br /><br />However, even at 1:53 running time, the movie feels a little long and sags some in the middle. Clooney and Pitt break up those sections with glimpses into their personal lives that are fun, but even those become noticeable as props to keep the plot flowing.<br /><br />I went to see the movie in the theater with my wife because that was where we'd seen the other two.  We wanted to see this one there.  It was a big improvement over the second movie, but it still didn't match expectations fostered by the first movie.  If you haven't seen Ocean's Thirteen yet, I'd suggest waiting for it on DVD and pick it up to complete your collection or to rent just to watch.ause that was where we'd seen the other two.

B00004T0UT|5.0|Off the heals of his 1968 Comeback Special, the King hit a ton of home runs during his Memphis recording sessions. This album just has everything! Top 10 hits in \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"In The Ghetto\\" and \\"Don't Cry Daddy\\", along with the great \\"Kentucky Rain\\".   <br /><br />  <br /><br />Every song is pretty much a winner in this bunch. I could write out several paragraphs on each one and its unique qualities and what Elvis brings to the table with his awesome vocals, but I think Amazon.com would write me a nasty e-mail saying I used up way too much space in the review column.   <br /><br />  <br /><br />I'll just say that if you are an Elvis fan, or even a rock fan of any kind, this album is some of Elvis' best work of his career, and arguably his best work period. He was a man with something to prove, an image to revive, and he scored in every aspect with this set of songs!
B000002OCP|4.0|Acutally, I like this, one of the more inventive albums from the era.  Putting Muddy Waters together with a bunch of hardcore psychedelic players actually made sense.  By 1968 acid rock bands playing hard electric blues were a commercial force, and Muddy hadn't had a hit for a long time.  So lets use all the goodies - distortion, fuzz, wah wah, and a drummer who isn't shy.  Doesn't sound like Muddy got it, but for the most part, he sounds great.  Most of those other bands didn't have a vocalist who could touch him.  It sounds like a Jimi Hendrix session with Muddy singing instead of Jimi - definitely an improvement. It's got a touch of funk like a very early Funkadelic and it's messy as hell.  Muddy wasn't going to do many takes on these songs, and lets face it.  These guys may have been inspired by Hendrix, but they weren't THAT good.  Muddy is most uncomfortable on \\"Let's Spend the Night Together,\\" and I can understand that.  He probably wasn't thrilled doing a song by a band that named themselves after his first big hit and more or less used his in-your-face macho schtick to make millions.  The covers of his own songs are better than most of those other bands' versions.  \\"Herbert Harper's Free Press News\\" is a real gem.  I saw Muddy perform a few years after this with a band more to his original style, and he wasn't near as good as on this album.  His band was mediocre, like they learned to play listening to Ventures records.  Maybe they had an off night, or maybe he hired cheap talent when he was on the road.  Anyway, I bought this album in the Tay Ninh Base Camp PX in 1969 where it was one of only two records on sale.  We played this album until the dust more or less destroyed it.  The CD has brought back great memories.
0689878451|5.0|I believe many people may read the book and see that it is a story of two penguins of the same gender raising a baby penguin and completely write it off as, at best, rubbish or, at worst, propaganda. To me it is just a lovely story that says there are all different kinds of families and as long as there is love, any family will do. That message is appropriate for every age, I think.    Of course there are people who wish the world to be as black and white as the subjects of the book, and when given evidence to the contrary foam at the mouth and allow personal hatred and fear embolden their voices. You'll have that.     As to the reviewer, and others who believe likewise, that the story is a lie becuase the penguins are not \\"together\\" any longer...well, I'm sorry to point this out, but the present doesn't negate the past. The events actually happened and so the story, by definition, is not a lie. The ending's just different.    The book itself is wonderful. Well told and well worded.

B00008PC2O|4.0|I bought the DVD in order to watch the Hi-Def version. I already have the older version of the movie, and I've seen it many times over the years. I have an HP laptop running Windows Vista, hooked up to my 50\\" Panasonic HDTV (1280x720), with the VGA connection. I loaded the disk, and it prompted me to install the InterActual player. Vista warned me that the program has issues with the new operating system. I went ahead, and installed it anyway, then immediately downloaded the newest version from the Internet. It then told me that I needed a DVD decoder that I could buy on their web page. I ignored that message, and went on to play the HD version of the movie. It played OK, after some initial stuttering during the first few screens.     The picture quality was very good, but the audio was not Dolby Digital 5.1, meaning that there is no surround sound. I followed up on the InterActual web page, and they confirmed this. Apparently, Microsoft used some other audio encoding. So, even though the picture quality is better, I chose to watch the lower definition, extended edition in order to get the DD5.1 sound. I find the sound quality is at least as important as the video quality.     The standard definition image is still very good. The nVidia chip set in my laptop does a nice job of upscaling. The 5.1 sound is spectacular as ever. The added minutes in the extended edition don't really add much, but the novelty effect is nice anyway. All in all, I'd say that it is worth the price at under $10.00.

0060764899|4.0|If you've never read a 'Chronicles of Narnia' book, you'll be surprised at what a quick read this is! Despite all the talk about 'Christian allegory' and other 'symbolism' that adults have tried to inject into Lewis' writing, the Narnia series, particularly this volume, is intended for kids above all else. The influences on 'Harry Potter' and other modern fantasy series are apparent. While Lewis' writing may lack a certain amount of polish in his descriptions, he manages to convey a lot of information in a relatively brief space, while leaving a lot to the reader's imagination. The four children are instantly likable(well, most of them are), and the various fantasy characters actually add something to the story than just comic relief.  I'd never read this book til now, and wish I'd picked it up years earlier!  Having read a bit about the other books in the series, I'm not sure if I'll continue. I found that 'Lion...' reached a logical ending point, and Lewis took the characters about as far as they could go. But 'Lion...' is best enjoyed as it was originally written; a nice fantasy story that will capture the attention of kids and grown-ups!

My favorites so far (hope it helps):  Icky Thump (awesome riff)    You Don't Know What Love Is (lighter song)    Little Cream Soda (there are a few crunchy riffs in here that are great)    I'm Slowly Turning Into You (Picks up better at the :56 second mark with a great riff and takes off from there with an awesome guitar solo)    A Martyr For My Love For You (most will like this song, it may be the next hit, but I will let you decide for yourself)    The more I listen to the album, though, the more I find songs that I enjoy.  You will, too.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Brad Paisley delivers again with 5th Gear. While you won't find any surprises on this album, at least Brad is consistent, something many country albums aren't now a days. The album will keep you laughing the whole way through, with a few tears in between. Unlike other reviewers, I like that Brad's brougth back the Kung-pao Buckaroos for this album. It proves that although Brad's had huge success (2007 ACM Top Male Vocalist), he remembers where he's come from (this skit-type track originated with Part II with \\"Too Country\\"). While all the songs on this album are radio-friendly, the most likely follow-up to \\"Ticks\\" will be the \\"Whiskey Lullaby\\"-esque \\"Oh Love\\" duet with Carrie Underwood. It makes the most sense in that it's a ballad and Carrie's running out of singles from her \\"Some Hearts\\" album and this will buy her some time until her album drops later this summer/fall. What screams $$$$$ more than the Top Female/Male vocalist singing a duet? It's like they knew that was going to happpen. Other singles might include, \\"Mr. Policeman\\", \\"It Did\\", and \\"I'm Still a Guy\\", the \\"I'm Gonna Miss Her\\" of this album. All in all, a great album, worth the $10 here on Amazon, or $20 any where else.
0765316978|4.0|Having read Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, my opinion is that this book is the best of the three. Like many of the other reviewers, I couldn't put the book down and read through the entire thing in one evening. My only frustration was finding out that Scalzi doesn't plan to write any more stories for these great characters!
0316067598|2.0|If you're interested in finding out about some aspects of our current military conflicts, and what it takes to be a SEAL then this book may be for you. Mr. Luttrell is a keen observer of people and places (probably a huge asset for his job.) He is also someone who has a giant ego (again, important asset for one of the most difficult jobs in the world.) He's part of a long tradition of brave men who have served, and this review is no comment on his character, but he gets sidetracked with personal comments that take away from some great moments. If you're fairly conservative, his political comments won't bother you. If you think enemies of the United States are inherently evil and not quite full-fledged humans, again, you won't be distracted. Based on the comments surrounding another negative review I think it's prudent to say that these comments are just a review of the book. I don't think the author would mind if one \\"Liberal\\" told another that this book contained partisan commentary that, in my humble opinion, turns a tribute of brave men into something else. As a book, I think it would have been more compelling with some humility and a degree of objectiveness. That aside, America is lucky to have people like Mr. Luttrell.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Scary, spooky, edge-of-your-seat, eerie, suspenseful show. Supernatural takes on subjects of urban legends, lore- anything that goes bump in the night and uses those nightmares to create \\"real-life\\" battles of good versus evil (creatures of darkness-demons/ghosts/zombies etc).     It's riveting to watch; most times you can't imagine just what exactly is coming. Season 2 is just as good as the first season- though I do miss Jeffrey Dean Morgan... The chemistry between the brothers is amazing- the comedic timing and overall combative relationship often results in hilarious laugh-out-loud moments. You can't help but chuckle over their antics. The show creators chose well with Jared Padelecki and Jensen Ackles- they play off each other really well.  Jensen has amazing delivery- the lines he is able to say with a straight face... WOW!    A couple of my favorite episodes are Folsom Prison Blues, Playthings, and Hollywood Babylon.  I was looking forward to Season 2's release especially for the extras.  The deleted scenes and gag reel were the best part of 1st season DVD and they're just as good here.  Jared's screen test is also there which is longer than I thought, but still interesting to 'witness'.  Though, the gag reel is the BEST.  As soon as I got the set, that was the first thing I watched.  Just as good as the first season's, maybe better.  Fun and hilarious!!  I wish my job was that much fun...      The second season ends with a big bang and lots of lingering questions are left to be resolved for season 3 and (hopefully) future seasons.  I can't wait to see what is coming next!  This is one show that I LOVE to watch!!! The stars are lovely eye candy, if nothing else... ;-)    The show makes a welcome distraction for drudging away on the treadmill.  Anything that makes the minutes fly by is welcome to me...
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre is my favorite book of all time. I love this adaptation. I also own the William Hurt movie version which I also adore but have always regretted the detail it omits.  This Masterpiece Theatre version captures the passion of the book, especially highlighted in the encounter between Mr. Rochester and Jane following their fated wedding which was not meant to be. It is very well cast though I found the choice of little Adele a bit odd. You will love Ruth Wilson as Jane. I have few criticisms of Jane Eyre. I thought the first meeting between Jane and Mr. R was a bit too harsh. Didn't love the occult board game addition. I also wish the childhood portion of the movie could have developed the relationship between Jane and Helen a little better. I also missed Miss Temple. While these are shortcomings in my opinion, they do not significantly detract from the overall beauty of this film. It is EXCELLENT!
B0002IVN9W|2.0|This is a simple case of an over-hyped record. It is not stunningly innovative or original, nor does it provide much in the way of emotional depth. It does possess some pretty cool qualities, but is also consistently hampered by numerous irksome ones.     The weakest link here is the singer. His voice sounds unattractive and annoyingly choked, like some spastic, sweaty adolescent who just got caught touching himself in the bathroom. He leaves me cold; I don't get any genuine feeling from him, just unintelligible energy. This unintelligibility, along with his irksome, affected warbly-ness, prevents him from conveying emotions with any real sincerity or depth.     The music fares better, but proves monotonous by the end. There are some genuinely nice moments, like the melodically pretty, low-key \\"Une Annee Sans Lumiere\\" (probably the best song), and the attractive, new wavey harmonic strumming in \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out).\\" \\"Haiti\\" is also a nice song, if a bit too repetitive. \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" sounded strangely familiar to me, and on the 2nd listen I realized that the chord progression totally cops the Pixies.     Many of the arrangements are quite nice, featuring strings, accordion, organ, and various forms of melodic percussion. At times it hints at the exotic or the baroque. But too often the band buries its best traits by devolving into pumping bombast. Rather than find a well-crafted resolution to a particular section or verse, they instead crank up the volume and start bashing away at some cliche arena-ready riff that could've been churned out by anyone with hands and a guitar.     So, while I've really tried to like his album, while I've tried hard to focus on the numerous good traits, the abundant negative aspects prove difficult to overlook (especially that singer's awful voice!). I can understand why this might appeal to a lot of people, but I fail to understand the \\"saviors of rock\\" tag the critics have bestowed on them.
0440238609|4.0|Sad when it was over - I hope we get to spend more time with my favorite polar bear and female witch.  I really enjoyed this book, especially Lyra, the \\"wise beyond her years\\" protagonist.  Mr. Pullman was able to create a beautifully vivid world that was part Victorian, part \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" and part modern.  Many memorable scenes.  Can't wait to ready book two and see the movie in Dec!!!!
B000FZETKC|5.0|Wonderful movie. One of John Hughes best efforts.

B00003CXBK|5.0|The Princess Mononoke is a contemporary fable, an outstanding story, a vibrant and emotive warning for us, the human beings, but besides, iot's an invitation and (if I may)a smart returm to the roots of myth and the encounter with the Geeat Spirit of the Forest, wolves and characters that have aprofound specific weight and transcendence into we denominate the primordial essence of the nature's scream.<br /><br />Far beyond its relevant significance, there is a lot of significative issues that you should take into account, because the kinetic script involves you from start to finish.<br /><br />Don't overlook this picture, beacuse it's much more mature than many pretended films for adults.<br /><br />Fabulous is the word to qualify this extraordinary novie. Don't miss it!
B000MTFDCO|1.0|OK- let's just get the fact out of the way that this movie was fantastic.  I remember seeing the trailer in theatres, thinking it looked great.  So I was one of the few that actually caught it in the theatre and actually loved it.  (One of the few films that lives up to a great trailer).    So for the HD version.  I have to agree with most of the BAD HD reviews.  This is a total \\"embarrassment\\" on the part of Universal for releasing such an obviously, un-remastered version of it in HD.  You actually can tell there is a slight difference on a 56\\" HD screen but for smaller TV's, I can imagine there is almost no gain at all in quality over the standard dvd (which was an earlier generation transfer to begin with).  This is such a shame because this film along with a lot of Fincher's other \\"dark\\" (actual film quality vs. content) films deserve better treatment.  Do not waste your money thinking it will look better because it's on HD-DVD.  We'll have to wait for it to get remastered which does not look good at this point.  I doubt Universal will follow Sony's suit in remastering, like the fifth element after bad bluray reviews.  Universal chose HD-DVD because it's cheaper to produce so they probably won't listen to consumer's reviews on horrible transfers. (you know...the savvy consumers that buy up early generation players/software to get things started.)
B000RJO578|3.0|The onslaught of defensive comments about the movie brought my reviewing score down. That's okay.  I still stand by my commentary. Blood and guts don't a movie make. A brilliant story-line does.<br /><br />Have all your buddies make comments and lower my reviewer reliability score - or - hey - make a better film next time. Brilliant.<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />OK, at first I thought this was a slapstick type comedy, so I was not sure what to expect.  At least - I thought - it would be in the same category as The Full Monty - English humor and great, authentic acting.<br /><br />But, it looks like the Hollywood influence kept this movie from being as funny and and as entertaining as it could have been.  The acting was okay, but the story should have been the strongest feature.<br /><br />Instead the producers made it all about the blood and the violence.  And I am not sure if I do not \\"get\\" the British humor in it, but I think that it could have been funny and witty without all the violence that went on and on and on.....<br /><br />Again, maybe I just did not \\"get it\\" but I left the film feeling like it was a bloodgasm - rather than a real film. Have the English stooped that low - to compete with Hollywood?<br /><br />----------------<br /><br />Because of the responses, I must update my review.  The film was not funny or meaningful.  Period.  It was not the Full Monty and never will be.  Defend it if you may - if you are a self appointed film critic or cop tough guy.  The film was not good.  It sucked bad.  Very bad.
0316018953|3.0|Cantankerous and angst-ridden Harry Bosch is at it again.  What's different is that literary constraints imposed on the author allow only glimpses of his soul to be revealed in this short book.  No time for lengthy flash-backs or existential reflections that, in other Bosch stories, end up creating stagnation points for the plot and in others add unnecessary baggage.      The story itself is not overly complicated and it flows nicely, with just enough new clues emerging in every chapter to make the reader want to go on.  And once the light can be seen at the end of the tunnel, there is no unnecessary dwelling on the inevitable action scene.    So far, so good, but there are a couple of flaws.  The story pivots around the ability of the perpetrators to misdirect the investigation.  Unfortunately, their choice of disposal for the stolen material is  totally inconsistent with the cunning displayed in other aspects of their plan.  Since the disposal of the material is the key that allows Bosch to piece together the puzzle, this is not an insignificant flaw.  The second issue has less to do with the details of the plot and more with the background in which the whole story is framed.  Themes such as the incompetence of organizations spawned in the aftermath of 9/11, interservice rivalry and inability to share information effectively among law enforcement agencies are way too trite for an author of Connelly's caliber.  The fact that he resorts to them is, quite frankly, disappointing.    Having said that, the book will keep you on edge pretty much from beginning to end.  It's just that, every once in a while, you'll feel like rolling your eyes and emit a muffled groan.  When that happens, just read on.
B000O5AYCA|5.0|After discovering [[ASIN:B0007LCNKM The Alligator]] last year and listening to the song Secret Meeting with the \\"..I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain..\\" echoing thru the rest of the album I decided to go a little further and explore their previous works.     [[ASIN:B0002JUX38 Cherry Tree]]  with the theme \\"about today\\" automatically owned me the first time it hit my cd player.     [[ASIN:B0000C8AOY Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers]] revealed me \\"Slipping Husband\\", just repeating itself in the stereo until that little moment where he throws his tongue out to unleash \\"..Dear we better get a drink in you before you start to bore us..\\".     There are some rare cds that have the ability to just keep growing inside us and reavealing each time yet undiscovered moments of true joy. The National is just the band that allways share with us this kind of cds. It's for me, their trademark. They grow inside you.    Boxer is not different. It just started growing in me play after play and revealing already his first singular moments of true joy.    Truly a must for any music fan.. 5*
B0002F6AH0|2.0|The very first episode was great ... after that it was hit and miss. I found multiple times I wanted to fall asleep on some episodes, but stayed awake out of some desire to feel I watched the whole thing. It is also narrated from a British perspective, and so as an American, I found little to entertain my appetite. Especially Pacific theatre combat with the Americans was almost none existent, as if British combat and especially in Burma was the only real thing that happened. It does have good insights into the Nazi's and rewards itself here and there, but overall I think the British slant and focus ruined the series.  <br />  <br />I also found it humorous that the narrator tried to label Hitler as \\"right-wing\\" when he was a Socialist dictator. What?
B000ICL3KG|3.0|As mentioned in the DVD, when ice on Greenland melts, it flows into Atlantic and stops the warm North Atlantic Current hence pushes Europe into ice age. However, the sun will heat up the Arctic so much that in the end Europe will be OK.     I give this movie 3 stars because it lacks entertainment and does not focus enough on what the possible strategies are for human race to survive. Because the CO2 emission is so much interlinked with human economic, social, and even vital (after all we inhale oxygen and exhale CO2) activity, what can we do? The movie concludes that we can overcome the global warming if we use renewable energy, drive hybrid car, and turn down air conditioning. Al Gore shows in graph each of these activity will cut CO2 emission increase by like 10% and added together CO2 emission will decrease. But no proof that any of these activity will cut emission by any where close to 10% was ever given. In the end this movie reduces only to fear mongering using exaggerated computer generated graphics.
0007162308|5.0|What an amazing audiobook.  The reader is just amazing.  His voice reeled me in easily.  I heard most of the book during a drive from NYC to Washington DC to Washington, Virginia to NYC...and the end from NYC to Bedford Hills, NY.  I laughed...and I thought about life intently from many of the profound words in this book.  I HIGHLY recommend this one.  It's such a great book.  I plan to buy the new illustrated hardcover that will soon be released--I loved it that much.  I learned so much.<br />Lines that I loved:<br />Nature draws the grandest pictures.<br />Adventure beckons.<br />To lose your mother is like losing the sun above you.<br />To lose your father is lo lose the one whose guidance and help you seek who supports you like a tree trunk supports its branches.<br />Fear is life's only true opponent.<br />It's important in life to conclude things properly; only then, can you let go.
B00005JPD0|3.0|Denzel Washington in this movie is way too emotional and not nearly as cool as in other movies like \\"Training Day\\". He was basically a stalker!    Another thing I didn't like about this movie is the computer graphics. The director must have believed we will think the past viewer CG so cool and like it so much that he used it over and over again. On the contrary, I feel slightly insulted to be thought of that way. I like computer graphics in movies that are used to reproduce reality to show spectacular scenes that cannot be shot otherwise, like those in Star Wars episodes. However, I loath CG used as if it were something cool, e.g. CG on computer user-interface. When PCs are so ubiquitous these days everybody can tell a good user-interface from a bad one. And bad ones are not cool to me, no matter how much computer graphics you put into it. They should have just showed the past viewer as a Windows-based application as would be developed in research institutions in reality today.
0765315246|4.0|OMW is along the lines of Starship Troopers in terms of the overall conflict out there in the big bad Universe as well as a telling of war from a soldiers perspective.  That said, I really like the direction he took it in with old people joining up for a colonial army they know little about, all for the promise of renewed youth. The downloads, the new bodies, all very fascinating.    *spoiler alert*  I am still waiting to find out why they only seem to use old westerners (I understand why the aged are chosen) and not Easterners who are the colonists.  Hopefully I will find out in Ghost Brigades or perhaps more likely in third book, The Last Colony.

B000J10ERO|2.0|What else can you say about a franchise \\"restart\\" that feels, plays, and ends like a drawn out coda instead of a jubilant new beginning.  Helmer Brian Singer is handed the keys to the character that can do anything, along with 60+ years of stories to draw from, but what does he do with it?   An Oxygen network movie of the week, with almost perfunctory nods to what the character is really about.  Singer attempts to pull drama and tension from the romance of the 80's movies, but since the actual parting between the leads is never adequately explained, there is no real tension in it, nor any real drama to be had in its resolution, only the ill-defined squirming sensation that relationship sitcoms get in season 2.       This genre and this character each have clichés of their own.  Those clichés are fundamental to making the character who he needs to be, and the stories true to that character.  The question has to be: Why do a Superman movie if you don't really want to tell a Superman story?  I am at a total loss for some the new direction taken by this movie.  A new character is introduced that has nothing to do with the established mythos, a character that will gobble plot space in any subsequent in-continuity stories.  Without giving anything away, imagine if you went into a Bond movie, and they had replaced \\"M\\" with a pair of CGI wisecracking dogs voiced by Robin Williams and Larry the cable guy.  It might be funny, and it might make a few bucks, but it wouldn't be a Bond movie anymore.  That's what we have here:  a story line that drifts cheaply and unnecessarily so far away from the source that it's no longer Superman.       Routh and Spacey do serviceable jobs, respecting and building on the previous actors' styles while adding the touches needed for the new project, but Kate Bosworth is a total disaster.  Staggering from scene to scene with a freshly tasered junior high vibe that conveys nothing of what her character is supposed to be.  Lane, the reporter, is30-ish, sharp, refined, sexy, accomplished, and world weary but still energetic and positive.  Bosworth comes across as 19, slow, dull, suburban, mousey, coddled, and resigned.  (Better casting would have been to put the underutilized Parker Posey in this role, but she's wasted providing paint-by-numbers comic relief.)      Even the iconic outfit, a 100% no-brainer, is just wrong.  The color scheme was so bad that I had originally thought it was deliberate disinformation to throw off merchandise counterfeiters.  No such luck.  Baby blue and dark brick red:  The man of steel rendered as your grandma's basement laundry room.    Off the reservation on the major plot points, tone deaf on the female lead, wrong on some obvious details, and silent on the continuity problems.  Just two or three action pieces, and a final climax that never climbs above \\"OK, I pushed hard once, but now I'm REALLY pushing hard\\".      Worth a watch just to say you've seen it, but it's a let-down to anyone expecting a Superman movie to tell a Superman story.
0800177363|5.0|I still remember this film, so many years later.  AWAKENINGS made me realize that Robert De Niro had the talent and the ability to portray a deeply human and profound character, Leonard, a man who has lived in his own world for many years, in a very sensitive way.  He wasn't just a hit man or a thug!  This role solidifies his depth as a performer and was worthy of much praise.  Dr. Malcom Sayer (Robin Williams) a shy man, decides to test the effects of the drug L-Dopa on catatonic patients in his hospital--Leonard being one of them.  It is a miraculous feat that he seemingly brings those under his care \\"back from the dead.\\"  The transformation is astonishing.  It's also amazing that this was based on a true story that occured in the life of Dr. Oliver Sachs.  The film also stars Julie Kavner (best known as the voice of Marge Simpson on THE SIMPSONS), as Dr. Sayer's devoted nurse.  The film has moments of tremendous joy and heartwrenching setbacks.  It doesn't have the 'typical' Hollywood ending, but that doesn't take away from the feeling that awakens in you upon watching AWAKENINGS.  Powerful and very memorable.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I used to be such a LP fan. Hybrid Theory and Meteora were albums that literally changed my life when I first heard them. They were simple albums that were fun to rock out to, and they rocked. That is the universal truth.<br /><br />LP had spent 18 months on this album and finally released it after a 3 year wait.<br /><br />Seriously, not one bit of this album appeals to me at all. Not even one.<br /><br />I can see why people consider this as the worst LP album ever (even me). I'm almost embarrassed that I am a fan of LP.<br /><br />Let me start off my ranting by saying that Chester's voice sounds HORRIBLE on this album. He sounds like he was depressed the whole time they were making this. On \\"Valentine's Day\\", he starts off the song trying to sound like Trent Reznor, but sounds just plain awful!<br /><br />Mike taking over dosen't help the fact that Chester sounds awful. He takes over vocals for one song, and he sounds OK, but at the same time sounds like someone in a karaoke contest trying to cover a Bobby Womack song.<br /><br />Another thing- Why is the guitar so boring and tired in this album? Some people might look up to the guitar work in Meteora and Hybrid Theory as \\"boring power chords\\"- that wasn't what I noticed in either CDs. They're what I noticed in \\"Minutes To Midnight\\".<br /><br />The Lyrics are also another disposable quality. Maybe Chester should stick to writing them from now on, Joe and Phoenix write like 2 year olds. Take a look at these lyrics from \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\":<br /><br />\\"Forgetting<br />All the hurt inside<br />You've learned to hide so well<br /><br />Pretending<br />Someone else can come and save me from myself<br />I can't be who you are.\\"<br /><br />Also, Hands Held High is another example of poorly done songwriting. The chorus is literally \\"Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen.\\" Another thing- I have no problem with swearing in music, but why are the obligatory F-bombs thrown in there?<br /><br />I recently watched an interview with Chester and he said that he was tired of other bands stealing their direction, but this just dosen't cut it. If this is what I want, I'll buy a U2 or Snow Patrol record.<br /><br />So if you like LP, get their two other albums, and not this dreck.ut it.

B0000AUHOH|4.0|I have come to appreciate this movie after having watched it several times and being a fan of the original series since 1971.  I believe this movie was more in tune with some of the more light hearted episodes of the original series(i.e. Trouble with Tribbles).  There was a certain amount of episodic content to this movie that reminded me of the original 79 episodes(unlike a lot of modern Star Trek fiction which is far from the original concepts).  The movie was a little top heavy with typical Shatner-esque self-indulgence(he directed of course).  However, I was really impressed with the return to the triumvirate of the original series with McCoy's comical involvement with Spock which I feel was missing from a lot of the movies.  As a pure intellectual adventure this was a rather fun movie albeit it suffered from poor financial support from Paramount.  I think Shatner tried to preserve a little of the flavor of the original series although it was a bit jaded with his now infamous megalomania.  From what I understand the plot of this movie had been floating around for years between Roddenberry and Shatner and their somewhat audacious and presumptuous views of the universe and religion.  I would recommend this movie over Star Trek 1, 3, and even 4(this one was way to contrived and any sci-fi movie that brings you to the present or has aliens impersonate normal people is just an obvious attempt at saving money).  In conclusion, I did enjoy this movie and I felt it is a good entry in the series and I feel it was more like the original series than a lot of the other movies.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|THERE ARE NO MARINES IN THIS PICTURE - IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THEM, THEY ARE NOT HERE.  What there is a mildly intersting conspiracy/suspense flick.  If you can get past every one of jimmie lee swagger's shot being a head shot.  Kate Mara reminds me of a young Ali MacGraw; and that really dates me.  Danny Glover is getting to make it a habit at playing the bad guy.  900+ yard head shots at moving targets very unrealistic.  A 2 Man stack to enter the cabin, more than a little unrealistic.  Good enough for Saturday afternoon viewing.  Buy it on sale or rent it.
1593080255|4.0|this is one of the most accessible period novels i've ever read. the style of the storytelling is very conversational... indeed sometimes it seems like the main point is to showcase the conversations, especially the ones with Lord Henry in them, who is very quotable. i read that oscar wilde used to think of his witticisms ahead of time and then try to steer the conversations to a place where he could say them in public, and i guess there's no conversation more artfully directed where you want it than one you write yourself.<br /><br />the basic story is one that most people know before they pick up the book, but the descriptive style and the snappy dialogue are interesting enough that it doesn't matter. the only real flaw is that it seems like a lot of the book is missing towards the end... the story wraps up a little too quickly and the descriptions of dorian's descent into depravity is really beautiful but also incredibly vague and so that kind of helps to flatten the pacing near the end.<br /><br />overall i'd highly recommend this book, especially for lazy-reading. it has that kind of dreamlike quality to it.
B000J10ER4|5.0|Like everyone else at the local theater, I sat spellbound through the whole thing. I'd been reluctant to see it because despite how old they are, I'm a big fan of the original Chrstopher Reeve movies not to mention I'd heard they paired Lois off with somebody else and hated the very idea. Still, the rest of my family was going. So, reluctantly, I went, thinking that they probably had messed the movie mythology up beyond repair. Surprise! Wrong. First a link to the old movies, then...\\"Hey! Isn't that music kind of familiar?\\" I was grinning before the first actor ever came on screen. And I'd seen Kevin Spacey on other movies; he never suggested to me the Lex Luthor type. Guess what? He did even better than Gene Hackman (if THAT is possible)! Luthor has a feel of realism that makes you see how dangerous he really is. Kate Bosworth, probably not the Mommy type, plays the transformed Lois Lane with understated skill(c'mon folks, cut her some slack). And last but definitely not least, when I got my first good look at Superman, I was stunned enough to wonder whether Christopher Reeve had a son, younger brother, or even a cousin who was in acting! Then I wondered if maybe they made Brandon Routh up to look like Reeve so old-time fans would take the change well, but not so. And I think it was a smart move to take up where the second Reeve movie left off(though I'm one of the few who actually liked the other two also). It opened the door to a lot of potentially juicy developments.<br /> The mood of the movie manages to be kind of tragic, bittersweet and optimistic at the same time which actually fits the story of Superman to a tee. And in direct contradiction to many reviewers' opinions, I think that a young cast is a good thing. To me it means SEQUELS(how bad can that be if Bryan Singer stays on as director?)! It means that the actors will have a chance to continue to make the characters their own.<br /> Still I guess it's only fair to also note any shortcomings. I hated the new suit; they should have stuck with the one Chris Reeve wore or at least something similar. The cape looks plastic! You know, like rain slicker material. And the imfamous symbol on his chest? Also plastic. Plus the colors were all off; so dark that the red looks maroon. If the bright colors didn't look stupid before, why should they now? It's not out of style to learn from the past. Oh, and it's pretty pathetic the way they keep comparing Superman to Jesus Christ as Savior. There is just no contest between saving someone's earthly life and saving their eternal, everlasting soul.<br />So anyway, pet peeves stated.

B000HL0K98|5.0|It is incredible that this second pilot, \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\", was the \\"dumbed down\\" version of the original Star Trek concept demanded by the network.  Although not quite as deep and layered as \\"The Cage\\", this tele-novella far exceeds even the high standards of the best of the series' subsequent product.  Stellar performances from Sally Kellerman, Gary Lockwood and William Shatner, with Leonard Nimoy very good but still feeling out his role; almost equivalent to the magnificent cameos of Agnes Moorhead, Carol Burnett and Joan Crawford in the Twilight Zone, Outer Limits and Night Gallery, respectively.  Also pristine production values with the original pilot sets, livery and saturated colors before network money was poured in for the original series renovation.  Very worthwhile for anyone interested in the series itself, classic early color television production, and American popular science fiction in its post-war/early civil rights prime.
1401207928|3.0|I loved the movie \\"V for Vendetta,\\" which I had watched about nine months before I read this book, and, like many other comic book fans, I also greatly enjoyed Moore's [[ASIN:0930289234 Watchmen]], so I was really looking forward to finally reading this. The story is about one person who, embodying an idea, attempts to overthrow a Nazi-like British regime, which comes to power during the cold war. It is a very dark tale, and David Lloyd's artwork works well, although I usually prefer more realism in comic book drawing. There are some intricate subplots that do finally come together in the end, but can be confusing until then. The belief that bad governments should fear their people and that things shouldn't be the other way around is definitely a big part of the book. Overall, I really liked the plot but felt like some of the side stories weighed it down a bit. Avid comic book fans will surely enjoy it, but I'd suggest that anyone else just watch the movie, since that version is excellent and captures the best things about \\"V for Vendetta\\" without the fluff.
0099457156|4.0|If you are a John Grisham fan and have read most of his other novels you will find this one on the average.  I have read them all and am a huge fan of his. This book is not a legal thriller like a lot of his others. The title of this book may be a little misleading to some people who are looking for a legal thriller. Very little of this book takes place in the courtroom. It is a simple book about life in the small town of Clanton, Mississippi and the events that take place during a nine year span in which a young college graduate named Willie Traynor owns the local newspaper.     This would be a great book to read while on vacation or just want to relax with a simple and easy to read novel.  It has a very simple plot with just a few characters.     Throughout this book I was kind of reminded of A TIME TO KILL, Grisham's first novel. This is a good book but not THAT good, but it did have some of that southern racial theme to it.    I found that my favorite part of this book was Grisham's sly sense of humor. There were a couple of times I laughed out loud at his writing.  I think sometimes Grisham wants us to take a step back and realize how stupid we are for taking some things in life so seriously. And of course I liked the little twist at the end.    I do have to be honest and say that I felt some parts of the book kind of lulled a bit.  It is certainly not as good as his early books, but those will always be hard to beat. Overall it is definitley a four star book and in my opinion worth the time spent reading it.
0141439475|5.0|Sorry to you religious types, but this novel describes the human condition more powerfully than any \\"spiritual\\" tome.  To say that it is about responsibility, scientific as well as parental, would be true but also misleading as to the true depth of the work.  Like some greek tragedy, there are no truly evil characters in this story.  Both Victor Frankenstein and his creation are the victims of their own personalities.  Destiny or psychology?  Ponder the creature's emotionally wrought story well, for it describes perfectly the psychology of a terrorist who is a human being with family, not some inhuman monster, who strikes out at those he perceives as uncaring to his real or imagined wrongs suffered at the hands of others. Many forget that this was a horror story.  Though the creature started out innocent, in the last third of the novel it has matured into a destructive force.  And what a force!  It haunts Frankenstein like some demonic monkey on his back, stalking him and killing his loved ones while Frankenstein is unable to expose him to the world without admitting his complicity in the creature's existence, even if he were to be believed.  At one point, he ends up in an insane asylum.  The novel starts with Frankenstein's obsession to create life, and ends with his obsession to destroy what he has created.  A timeless portrait of the human condition in all its wretchedness.

B000002LFL|5.0|the smiths only official live album 'rank' is a treasure among live albums.. morrissey's charismatic stage presence and vocal talent obviously seem to steal the show.. but this is a great band effort with some great guitar playing by johnny marr... the song selection covered all their albums up to that time and featured their current single 'ask'.. There is a great excitement to this album.. the band sounds fresh and daring.. it is a shame that they would break up so soon.. but that is the way it goes.. morrissey would go on to what is still proving to be a great solo career..
B000P2A24W|5.0|When I first heard Bon Jovi was doing a country album, I was not afraid like a lot of die hard fans because I like a lot of new country. Music from people like Keith Urban and Kenny Chesney fits for the child of the 70's in me who grew up with the Eagles and Jimmy Buffett among others. I was already an adult in my 20's when Bon Jovi hit the scene so unlike those who loved them as teenagers a change is not so devastating to me as say Bruce Springsteen singing someone else's folk songs was. So take my review with the grain of salt that I do love today's country music. That being said, I believe this is the finest writing this band has done since These Days, their 1995 album of introspection which didn't resonate with a lot of the 80's rock crowd at the time but now is revered as one of their best. This CD was written in Nashville and Jon, Richie and the boys wrote and played with some heavy hitters. Hillary Lindsay who co wrote Jesus Takes the Wheel among others. Big and Rich who have become honorary country cousins to the Jersey boys. Lee Ann Rimes who adds her beautiful voice to the stunning duet Strangers. And produced by Dann Huff of Keith Urban and Rascal Flatts fame and John Shanks, who has co written many Keith Urban hits. Add to this mix of talent and the anticipation of Jersey meeting Nashville personal turmoil within the band and you have the backdrop for personal and heartfelt songs which at the end of the day, whether you call this new country or Bon Jovi rock and roll (I would argue you can hear both), that is what good country music is all about.    Highlights for me are Lost Highway, the road song of the summer, Whole Lot of Leaving which features some Keith Urban style celtic stylings and reflects the inner turmoil band members were feeling, We Got it Going On which is stereotypical Bon Jovi and Big and Rich in one big old fun mash up, Seat Next To You which has a real If I Should Fall Behind quality to it about everlasting love, and Till We Aint Strangers Anymore which has Nashville duet hit written all over it.     So crank up the mature Bon Jovi on the that Lost Highway- the possibilities are endless!
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti smith has to be the most free of all the rock stars.. Her style is hers alone.. her energy and intensity.. her free use of language (obviously influenced by poetry), and above all her cathartic expressive process - prove that she is the best - that is she is herself..<br />the album Horses opens with one of her tamer tracks - a rocker 'gloria' it is followed by a true gem 'redondo beach' then it falls into the first spoken word expedition 'birdland'...  'kimberly' is another of my favorite tracks - but nothing can quite prepare you for the title track which is one of the few truly transcendant vocal tracks i have heard.. the album ends perfectly with the quiet 'elegie'..<br />this is an album you have to experience even if you do not like it - you still have to admire it as something truly different..

B00005JPQP|4.0|\\"Ocean's Thirteen\\".  Yes, it's a lot of fun but little more.  But what would you expect?<br /><br />As most people would know, \\"Thirteen\\" is the third part of what is becoming a series around the antics of Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team of Hollywood buddies.  The plot is inconceivable in any realistic sense but who really cares?  This is a movie about characters and the fun they get up to.  No one would seriously expect anything more.  So long as you have this mindset, \\"Thirteen\\" offers a couple of hours of good escapism.
B000000OAC|4.0|Queen was on a great run in the mid to late seventies, critics be damned. As the old guard suffered the slings and arrows of the punk movement, Queen was almost ambivalent. Never darlings of the rock intelligencia, they kept producing their staduim big rock, albeit in a more stripped down manner for 'News of the World', released in October 1977. Descibing it as just another Queen album would not do 'News' justice. Though it is not of 'Opera' quality, it did produce two of the band's alltime greats, \\"We Will Rock You\\" and \\"We Are the Champions\\". Though tired of them I am, you cannot ignore the contributions to rock music that both songs made, care of messieurs May and Mercury respectively. Very tribal and very American in their stadium appeal, their impact as a double A side single was instantaneous. Other notable songs include \\"It's Late\\", a Brian May metallic rocker that was Queen's heaviest track since the early days, a strong personal favorite. \\"Get Down, Make Love\\" is another courtesy of Freddie and a strong drum sound from Roger Taylor. John Deacon contributes \\"Spread Your Wings\\" which is a nice song about going for your dreams and features another passionate Mercury vocal. Roger's \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" is a little overrated I think, though better than his \\"Fight from the Inside\\". \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" is too jazzy, \\"Sleeping on the Sidewalk is too bluesy and \\"Who Needs You\\" is too, I don't know...latin?? for my tastes. I really like 'News' don't get me wrong but I think they tried too many styles one too many times. What worked on 'Sheer Heart Attack' in '74 didn't really work here. Still, any Seventies era Queen is still a must buy for fans of hard rock. Remix of \\"Rock You\\" is pointless again and annoying.
1591841666|2.0|I ran across this very thin little tome while wandering through a local bookstore and thought it looked just interesting enough to give a second look.  Ostensibly about quitting (which I'd done recently, and was still quite excited about), it had also been marked down 20%, so I thought what the heck, and picked it up.    Even as thin as it is, though, and as small, and with an additional 20% off the cover price, it managed, somehow, to end up a complete waste of time.  While I agree with its main tenet -- there are actually two of them: \\"Quitting Is Okay, So Long As You Know When to Do It\\" (the main one) and \\"Be the Best in the World\\" (another one that gets somehow diluted for all the talking of dips, cul-de-sacs, and so on) -- I was hoping for a somewhat deeper explanation than what I ended up getting.      Godin's thesis can be summed up almost completely in four short sentences:  \\"There's good pain, then there's bad pain.  Running is good pain (it's valuable); chewing brokwn glass is bad pain (it's worthless).  If your job is good pain, you should stay.  If it's bad pain, you should quit.\\"  And that's it -- that's prety much all there is to it.    I think what Godin's trying to do here is create a new personal business philosophy meme, but it just doesn't work -- it's way too trite.  There are a couple of paragraphs on opportunity cost that I found somewhat valuable, but otherwise, I'd suggest skipping it.  And it's a shame, too, because I happen to believe pretty passionately in a number of concepts that it advocates -- it's just that Godin doesn't give any of them any more than the gloss-over treatment.  Pass on it.

1400079276|4.0|Kafka on the Shore is easily one of Haruki Murakami's most accessible, surreal, fun and enjoyable reads. When you put it down, I think you're left turning it over in two ways.  The first being trying to figure out how the two stories that occur in the book are connected and what exactly happened. The plot is like a labyrinth in it's structure (incredible considering Murakami apparently had no idea where it was going when he wrote it) that's a thrill to unfold and  a mindbender when you start piecing it together. The second thing you're left mulling over is  the point of the book.  I think that this is where Kafka on the Shore comes up a bit short. For me, it doesn't add up to much because while I think there are several points Murakami is trying to make, they end up getting lost underneath the dazzling storytelling.  I do have other complaints - the novel is a bit flabby, and some of the dialogue is a bit corny (this could be the fault of the translator Philip Gabriel who for the most part turns in a brilliant translation).   Despite these complaints, Kafka on the Shore will leave you floating on a cloud somewhere contemplating what you just read, unaware and oblivious to the world below.  Recommended.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|Some of RUSH's best work in years.  Hard and soft; full and melodic; rockin' and smooth.  A great disc to enjoy over and over.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|You really like the movie? Most likely you're really into comic-book carnival fantasies, complete with a skeleton on fire riding a motorcycle up and down the sides of downtown buildings? Ooooh, lots of noise, fire, and the giddy sense of seeing that even Satan has trouble with his own obnoxious, idiot offspring.     You really disliked the movie? Not so much for any one, two, three, or three dozen things. You just found it a tiresome, irritating waste of time. Maybe, though, you felt just a little bit of \\"sympathy for the devil\\" (Peter Fonda) in seeing what he has to put up with in a twenty-something son who won't get out of the house (hell) and get his own place to live with his own job to do. This contemporary juxtaposition, so typical in our own society, is what elevated this from a one-star movie to a two-star movie instead.    Oh, yes, the special effects were good. The special effects are always good. After all, it's 2007, for Pete's sake. But if that's ALL it has then it's like the wearisome \\"bread and circuses\\" paradigm. How in the world did they get Nicolas Cage to be in this thing anyway?      All in all, this is one of those \\"pizza and beer\\" movies you watch when you don't have a single serious thought in your head and don't want one, either...kind of like that \\"Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby\\" thing that was big last year.

0312360266|4.0|I'm a P.C. Cast fan so when I found out about this book I got excited, most of Cast's books have been really great reads so I was interested to find out how she would tackle blending Vampires with her wonderful trademark of Goddess-Touched Women. I was pleased to find that the duo of Cast and Cast have created quite a fleshed out world in Marked, I didn't have to sprain my suspension of belief muscle to get where the book was trying to take me. Though I must say I could not escape visions of a Vamperic Hogworts(Maybe its just me.) Zoey is Funny, honest, and angsty even though somtimes she seemed a tad on the preachy side, I liked that she had a strong idea of what was right for herself, and the friends she makes in her new life remind me strongly of people in my own.<br />Admittedly Marked is just busting at the seams with cliches and a formulated plot but in this case thats not such a terrible thing, and besides there are a few new/newer twists, that I won't give away. all an all Marked is a solid book, and a promising start to a series that looks like it's going to be lengthy series. I try not to drop a series once i've started it so I'll be keeping my fingers crossed that that the following installments are as good as the first one.

0553577123|5.0|It's my fault for following up a re-reading of The Catcher in the Rye with a re-reading of The Diary of Anne Frank.  I feel overwhelmed by memories of my youth.  The beautiful sunny day outside is fighting with my hyper-brooding and melancholy mood.  I don't think I was ever as fascinating as Anne is in her diary.  I know that I have never been so in earnest about anything.  Here's a teenage girl reading books like I used to play video games and watch stupid movies.  Here's a curious and Renaissance mind while mine has become complacent and clogged with jingles from television commercials.<br /><br />Anne's explorations into her own mind and emotions are naked and honest.  Her observations about war, God, love, the Jews, the Nazis, the British, and her family and friends emit alternating currents of acuteness and naïvet&eacute;.  Her sexual awakening is refreshing and innocent.  Her understanding of her own psychology is penetrating, complex, and unfolds over the course of the diary.  I'm amazed at the force of Anne's vibrancy.  It appears that even the worst of circumstances cannot stop a life-loving girl from becoming a woman.<br /><br />For all the wildness of Anne's thoughts and emotions, she gets closer to centering herself in the final few entries.  As she quickly matures in the last quarter of the diary, I noticed the right side of the book becoming thinner and I didn't want the diary to end, because I knew what that meant.  I swear that the closing pages of Anne's diary are haunted.<br /><br />At some point in your life, you should read Anne's diary.  I suggest re-reading it a few times throughout your life, in fact.  It remains an important historical document but also an eternal reminder of youth, life, and love when the world around you isn't like you know it should be.
0792846443|3.0|The book was better. In fact, the book had more blood and gore in it, than in the movie. The book also has a much better ending to it. But the Lauren person who played Anne Wilkes did an awesome job of it.
B000P0IW6E|3.0|Desmond Child seems to want the Scorpions to become \\"the Moths\\", as he's taken away their sting and bite, and much of their distinctive beauty and melody.        I'm quite surprised at the positive reviews for this album, as I was all excited to get it but quite disappointed upon listening.  I think I can say with confidence that (up to now) the least favorite (for myself and others) Scorps album would've been Eye II Eye.  And why?  Because they abandoned their hard rock/metal roots for mainstream pop (soft rock/r&b/techno) and they let the producer have too much of a hand in writing the music, despite the fact that they established their reputation on their own distinctive writing style.  Unfortunately, HUMANITY-HOUR 1 makes the same mistake.  Although the songs aren't as clear a departure, a look at the songwriting credits will show that (although a Scorpion gets partial credit for every song) 75% of the songwriting is attributed to non-Scorpions.  At first, I figured this might just mean they helped with the lyrics and gave some arrangement ideas, but the sad fact is more than one song bears a strong resemblance to some of the lame Aerosmith ballads from the 90's (Aerosmith having succumbed on NINE LIVES and others to letting producer/songwriters - including Desmond Child - suck the life out of their albums).      Supposedly it's a concept album about war between humans and robots, but the lyrics aren't printed in the booklet and a casual listen doesn't imply anything other than the usual pop lyrical focus.        There's some great heavy guitar on this album, but only about 10-20% of it.  Most of the songs are ballads or mostly-slow pop-rock songs that rock out only occasionally.  And the thing is, the Scorps write a nice ballad, and their excellent (non-rocking) CD PURE INSTINCT shows that they are quite able to write good songs that aren't \\"heavy metal\\".  Unfortunately, the folks writing the bulk of this material don't have the style and talent Schenkerand Meine do.  Desmond and friends write schmaltzy, forgettable, bland pop music that fans of Celine Dion may like, but that don't hold much value for a Scorpions fan.  I can't help but wonder why:   - If these songwriters/producers aren't into hard rock, they're bothering with the Scorpions   - If the Scorpions so recently as 2004 were releasing great metal, they don't hook up with a metal-friendly producer/songwriter like Roy Z instead of a lame poser like Mr. Child         So, the final product is hardly recognizable as a Scorpions album.  The boys put enough of themselves in it to make it decent, but not nearly as good as other Scorps CDs (even Eye II Eye can be distilled down to a pretty darn good 30-40 minute CD if you skip all the weaker tracks).  If you have all the other Scorps albums, go ahead and get it (I'd recommend one of the Amazon marketplace people who have it at a reasonable rate, though!).  You'll probably enjoy it.  But if you're looking to rock, I'd recommend any of their previous albums first.    And, of course, if you like modern pop-rock and aren't really into classic metal, this may be the Scorpions CD for you!

B000GIXEIG|1.0|The movie was well done- the acting and presentation was pretty good. However it managed to completely miss the point of the book. Since when was a man-eating monster just mistreated and misunderstood? Though Grendel was portrayed as a victim, bothe his and his mother's hovels were strewn with piles of bones! Despite his diet of people the king cannot think of a reason that he should have dispatched Grendel's father beyond the coincidence of their paths crossing. Such enormous liberties were taken with the story- to present the hero as the bad guy and the monster as the tragic hero! What a shame to take such a wonderfully crafted work and twist it to show \\"what it really must have been like.\\" The whole point of fiction is to see things beyond our scope. To edit and reduce this marvelous tale in order to make it match someone's idea of what must have been--that is truly tragic.

I just found the whole defense of zoos thing laughable (and it IS supposed to be serious). I just can't go along with a lot of his reasoning.

0385522401|5.0|The reader immediately gets a strong hint that marital difficulties are ahead as the author notes that two newly-weds, Edward and Florence, just sitting down to dinner in the honeymoon suite of a hotel on a beach in England, are virgins at a time in history (early 60s) when sexual matters were not openly discussed.<br /><br />They are recent college graduates: she in music, he in history. But more pertinent is the fact that they both had troubled childhoods resulting in their turning inward. Their chance encounter at an anti-nuclear proliferation rally seemed to portend a new chance for connectedness. Yet amid their professions of love and plans for the future, physical intimacy was conducted within very narrow bounds with unintended overstepping a constant concern.<br /><br />Though perhaps sexual dialog was somewhat suppressed in the early 60s, the relevance of this book is hardly tied to that era as open and relevant communication and the ability to adapt to situations are huge components in the soundness of relationships in any era. Unfortunately, it took a wedding night fiasco for Edward and Florence to even start revealing their innermost concerns and feelings. The remaining question is could these two very intelligent people find a way out the \\"mess\\" in which their reticence had placed them at the worst possible moment.<br /><br />Though short, this novel is superbly written. Though perhaps disheartening, the reader is given sufficient background to understand the culminating events.
B00005RYKU|3.0|\\"The Glass House\\" (2001) is one of those films that you enjoy during the viewing thanks to good directing, good technical film-making (production design-nicely staged action sequences-odd camera angles), and convincing dialogue; but look back at feeling generally dissatisfied. In part this is due to the moronic final ten minutes but then you realize that the premise itself is the real problem. You don't mind suspending disbelief during the viewing but afterward you resent the fact that a less elaborate script would have made your efforts unnecessary.<br /><br />The film is yet another example of Hollywood's ability, given a relatively large budget $20-30 Million, to put together a good-looking and visually believable suspense movie. It brings skilled technique to a plot that's a foregone conclusion, so the viewer must wait patiently for the characters to catch up.<br /><br />For film buffs (those who like to read a film) there is a fairly ambitious subtext inside \\"The Glass House\\"; working on both conscious and sub-conscious levels. Warm (orange tones) lighting for the safe/secure scenes and cold (blue tones) lighting for the places where things are off-kilter. The Glasses (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard) literally live in a \\"glass\\" house above the Malibu beach. The theme, that nothing is what it appears to be, is supported by a production design of reflective surfaces; mirrors, glass, and water (its always raining) that distort the images. Mrs. Glass is a physician in a pain center who is secretly addicted to her own medications. Mr. Glass runs a seemingly thriving limo service transporting famous clients behind smoked glass windows.<br /><br />There are several references to \\"Hamlet\\" with Ruby Baker (Leelee Sobieski) essentially in the role of the Melancholy Dane. The writer must have had this linked together much better in the screenplay but apparently several key elements of this dynamic never made it into production. This story is told entirely from Hamlet'spoint of view, a Hamlet who is frustratingly slow on the uptake and unable to make up her mind. And the viewer is supposed to be wondering what is real, what is wrongly perceived, and what is paranoid illusion. They even try to fool you with a dream sequence involving the return of Ruby's mother. Fortunately Sobieski (who looks like a young Helen Hunt) is an excellent actress and up to the challenge. Her performance (she is in every scene) keeps you focused on her story. The many scenes between her and Skarsgard are the film's real strength; they must carry the film since no one else in the cast is much of a factor.<br /><br />The film opens with a \\"film within a film\\" device, which turns out to be a horror film, late- night viewing for Ruby and her rave-loving high school friends. This is an early clue to the \\"nothing is what it seems to be\\" theme. It turns out that Ruby is quite a party animal and has been successfully deceiving her parents about her nocturnal activities. This night she returns home to find police cars parked outside her house. Believing herself finally busted she enters the house only to be told that her parent's were both killed in a car accident earlier that evening. This sets the stage for life with the Glass family, a childless couple who were friends with her parents. You instantly know that they are odd because the director works so hard to make them appear normal.<br /><br />Ruby and her little brother Rhett (Trevor Morgan) leave the San Fernando Valley to live with the Glass's in their expensive hilltop house. Can you say: \\"Hansel and Gretel in a Gingerbread cottage\\"? Things are weird from the start as the two children must share a room. Whatever the original rationale for this idea might have been got lost in the deleted scenes of the screenplay and it just seems silly and illogical (given the Glasses long-term plans). I assume that it was originally included to reinforce the idea that living in a glass house offers no privacy but who knows.<br /><br />From this point a lot of stuff happens which can be taken in several different ways with the director constantly laying misdirection. Wesley Strick's screenplay gets way too elaborate and cute with this stuff and the film must rely on many convenient coincidences to advance the storyline. But since this starts at about the midway point its too late to stop viewing now. Listening to the Strick's commentary track on the DVD it is clear that there was considerable meddling with the original story by producers, dumbing down the more intellectually compelling elements.<br /><br />Still little would have been lost and the overall credulity would have benefited by a less ambitious conspiracy, there was no reason for the parent's deaths to have been anything but an accident; it would have raised the film's IQ if the Glasses had been opportunists rather than conspirators. And the attempt at irony with the brake fluid would have worked better if Mr. Glass had been knocked out and put in his car; only to wake up as it is speeding down the road.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B00000269G|5.0|George Shearing is good too, but this is an Erroll Garner CD.  This record is great; read the other reviews for all the info.
B000PTYP5C|4.0|Well well. Dream Theater return in fine form on this album. Train of Thought and Octavarium really didnt impress me, I've STILL got my jaw dropped from Scenes From A Memory, and I was hoping for an album more in that vein. I'll agree with what one reviewer said: some good, some bad. Track by track rundown:    1. In The Presence Of Enemies Pt. 1 - 8/10 - nice strong start to the album.     2. Forsaken - 10/10 - my favorite track. The piano line is like something out of Images and Words-era DT, and the way the solo comes in (and the solo itself) is goosebump-inducing. Petrucci's phrasing = godly.    3. Constant Motion - 9/10 - Can someone say Metallica? But Dream Theater have never been ashamed of their influences, and this is a finer song than anything Metallica have released in the last 17 years or so. The breakdown that leads into the solo part is Dance of Eternity-ish, my fave part.     4. The Dark Eternal Night - 7/10 - some killer riffs, a great chorus, but I just cant let go of the fact that Petrucci said this song is literally about \\"monsters\\". I'm also not a big fan of the vocals in the verse.     5. Repentance - 9/10 - revisiting Portnoy's AA theme, this is a really haunting track. Guest...wouldnt say vocal appearance, more like talk appearance by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree (my fave band of all time) def adds to the mix.     6. Prophets of War - 7/10 - Cool riff, interesting song. Kind of gets boring after a while though.    7. The Ministry Of Lost Souls - 9/10 - I really dig this song. A mixture of much of what Dream Theater is in a single track. The melodies are fantastic.     8. In The Presence Of Enemies Pt 2 - 6/10 - it might grow on me, but so far this track isnt doing anything for me. Definitely not what I wouldve enjoyed the album closing on.     Overall, this is a good album. Recommended for fans of DT, but if youre just starting out with the band, pick up SFAM, Awake, and I&W.
B000AARKOO|5.0|The action never stops and it's just tons of fun.  The special effects are insane.  It's a summer action flick with a brain.
B00005BL2A|5.0|I don't think any album has ever grown on me quite like Exciter has. And I don't believe that time has simply made it more palatable - I'm pretty sure now in retrospect that the main reason I was initially disappointed was because it followed my favorite DM album, Ultra, so the bar was impossibly high. Also, it's undeniably more subdued than the previous albums. I love mellow stuff, but I wasn't expecting it, so it took me a little by surprise.  <br />  <br />Fast forward a half dozen years and now this is one of the DM albums I find myself going back to the most. I absolutely love it, and can't believe there was ever a time I didn't. I love that this album is different from the others in that it's the most low-key and romantic. It's such a beautiful album, and showcases elements of this great band that are not necessarily highlighted in other albums. The only song I still don't love is \\"Breathe,\\" but even that one I like a lot more than I used to. On the other hand, I think \\"Comatose\\" is one of the best Gore-sung tracks in their entire catalog (bizarre as it is). \\"Dream On,\\" \\"Shine,\\" \\"When the Body Speaks,\\" \\"Dead of Night,\\" \\"Freelove,\\" \\"I Feel Loved,\\" \\"I Am You,\\" and \\"Goodnight Lovers\\" are every bit as good as all the classics. The production on this album is superb, and often reminiscent of Bjork's Vespertine.  <br />  <br />If you gave up on this album early on and tossed it aside, calling it crap, I suggest popping it in sometime (preferably on a beautiful summer night) and giving it another chance. You may find that with the passage of time, you have changed your mind.
0141439580|4.0|Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.  The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.  Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.  It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all.
B000002UHG|5.0|When I first purchased this album in Sept.2006, I haven't been able to put it down since.<br />It took a few \\"listens\\" until I really appreciated this great piece of work by Rick. It appears to give me something a little different each time I listen to it. I had thought that there was nothing better than Water's \\"Amused To Death\\" but boy was I wrong. What a rich and profound album this is! You get a little bit of everything FLOYD here and it just all comes together perfectly. The begining (underwater sequence) is unbeleivable in Q sound right up until \\"A Thousand Furry Toys\\" where the story now begins. You will think that YOU are in a coma but you are quickly brought out of it and now realize that being a child, as in this case, an abused one, is being tossed about by it's parents into a bizzar world of obscurity and demise. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel for this poor child and in the end reaches for the sun just like a \\"banner unfurled and gently blown, and then before your wondering eyes a self you've never known\\".<br />Thanks Mr. Richard Wright ! Let's do it again........soon.
B000AADYUI|2.0|If this was Holland then this collaboration would be the Supertramp of Holland.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Five stars definitely !<br /><br />When I was first entertained by this film, I knew I had to buy it and share it with friends and family.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is just perfect in this role, Ed Wood would be proud !<br /><br />Martin Landauo is exacting in his performance of Bela Lugosi.<br /><br />The part I find really funny is where Bela Lagosi's is wrapping the unplugged  giant octopus around himself and then pretends to be struggling with it.<br />Highly recommended !
B000PJQNQG|5.0|This huge three-record set removes all doubts about the songwriting ability of George Harrison, and much of the material on the first two records is better than some of the tracks that ended up on the Beatles' final few albums--which is saying a lot.<br />I am not going to do a song-by-song run-through, but suffice it to say that there are enough classic songs on this set to keep you happy for years to come.  This ranks up there with any album the Beatles released, and it's so good that George never came close to duplicating it in terms of virtuosity, range or consistency.<br />A must-have in any Beatles collection.<br />The jam session on the last side is for purists only.  I think it's kind of fun.
B000P2A24W|5.0|This is the best Bon Jovi release in several years - the swap to Nashville really added to the mix in a GREAT way.  Target has 2 bonus cuts - one a live version of \\"I Love This Town\\" and the other is a bonus track called \\"Walk Like A Man\\" - and only $9.99
B00005V9IL|1.0|Before I even begin, I'd like to say that my one star rating is directed solely at the DVD itself-ANY VERSION, I've bought them all - NOT THE MOVIE! None of them!!!NOT ONE! is in anamophic (Enhanced) widescreen!!!! This movie is probably - who am I kidding? - is most defintely - THE BEST sci-fi movie ever made! It deserves a hell of a lot more than 5 measily stars! I give it 10, personally. All DVD incarnations of it, however, get absolutely NO stars from me. I can't, without being absolutely vulgar, express how unhappy I am with 20th Century Fox. They've sucked over $150.00 out of me - just trying to find a decent copy of this movie. I really wouldn't mind - $150.00 ain't much money - but I'm disabled and am trying to survive on about $700.00 a month! Get with the program fellas! Let me see it in true widescreen at least once before I die!

0316168815|5.0|I read this book because I followed closely the serial murder of Kelsey Smith and the fact that she had just read this book about a similar type of murder.I agree that the ending is a bit of a surprise, but the sad moments are very moving and the characters interesting.The reader is somehow left with the impression that Susie will have to be reincarnated or have the rest of her immediate family with her in Heaven to finally be happy.It always bothers me when life is cut so short with potentials unrealized, whether in a book or in real life.
B00005JA2B|5.0|Few bands can say that they have written and recorded a song that can be considered an all time classic.  On Kansas's 4th album the instant you hear the opening  harmony vocal arrangement of \\"Carry On My Wayward Son\\" you can't help but be hooked.  I have heard this song a million times over the years and I still crank it up and enjoy I when it comes on the radio.  It ranks right up with \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", \\"Freebird\\" and others and one of the all time most enduring classic rock songs.  \\"Leftoverture\\" is the album that would break the band into the mainstream.  Almost overnight they went from opening act status to headlining arenas.  The great thing about it was that they hit these commercial heights without compromising the quality of their music.  This is a great album from start to finish and shows the continuing maturity of the Livgren / Walsh songwriting tandem.  Musically everything here is killer.  There are no super long progressive rock epics on this one, but there is still plenty to please the prog rock fan with the 8 minute quirky closer \\"Magnum Opus\\" to the shorter, but still brilliant \\"Cheyenne Anthem\\" and \\"\\"Miracles Out Of Nowhere\\".  The rest of the album is also dazzling.  \\"The Wall\\" remains a live favorite.  \\"What's On My Mind\\", \\"Opus Insert\\" and \\"Questions Of My Childhood\\" are shorter, but great in their own way.  You really can't go wrong with this album as it deserves the level of success that it reached.  This is also the album where the first hints of Kerry Livgren's conversion to Christianity begin to show up in the lyrics.  At this point it is still pretty subtle, but it would eventually be the cause of Steve Walsh leaving the band a few years later.
0061120073|5.0|I first read this book as required reading my freshman year of high school. At the time I hated it. I read it again for fun about a year later and could not believe how great it was. I too was an avid reader as a young girl, just like Francie Nolan. I still have the same old beat up copy of the book I read in high school. I have seen the movie more times than I can count, and they're both wonderful. I think this should be required reading for every school child, especially the girls! Like me, they may not get it at first, but if they give it a chance, they will not be sorry.

0671799320|5.0|This book is the better form to say what means the oil in the world. The history is well clear end real. There are many important information and who is curious or needs to know the subject this is a perfect one.
0440237688|5.0|Now, as technology  touch every inch of our existence, how much we think and to what extent should we allow them into our lives?  <br />  <br />  <br />The reason I am reflecting is that I read a book entitled The Giver which  is written by Lois Lowry.  This book actually is for a book for children, and in fact have won a good number of awards, including the John Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American Literature for Children.  It was originally read by my son who told me it was good, and I took it. Incidentally, it is always good to take an active interest in what your kids are reading, and ocassionally won't harm much if you actually read it as well.  That i believe, always create good talking points with your kids.  <br />  <br />The story is quite thought provoking, and basically centers on a community in which the people, years into the future, use technology try to create a world where everything is perfect.  It might seem bizarre, but overall, it does seem plausible that if we are too overzealous and if we could do it, we will be headed in that direction.  <br />  <br />When you consider that a lot of grief or sorrow is because of poverty, then solve poverty.  A lot of bad things come because of war, then use technology to acquire peace.  If hunger is the issue, then insure that there won't be any hunger.  But the policymakers in this book went beyond that -- they noted that a lot of grief comes from pain, so they were able to work out the perfect medicines that will cure pain and disease.  Much grief comes from love, envy, anger,  and greed, so basically they develop the pills to control that as well.  <br />  <br />If you consider that people also becomes sorrowful because they make the wrong choice so they eliminated choice as well.  So in this community, a committee of experts make the evaluation what jobs you get  ( depending on detailed recordings and observations on your interests and talents), who you marry, and also they have systems to insure that only healthy kids are born, and these are assigned to the right 'nurturers' to insure comformance of the system.  <br />  <br />In short, this was supposedly a story about a society where there is supposedly no fear, or no pain.  Something like nirvana, or heaven, where everything works and is programmed to be just right.  There is nothing unexpected, unusual or even inconvenient.  Everything works according to plan, just like clockwork.  <br />  <br />In short, the author perceives that we can actually not only use technology to improve our lives, but if we are not controlled, we will be moving forward to using it to shield us from everything that would cause sadness or grief, and if we allow technology to do that, sooner or later, we will come up with technology to do precisely that.  <br />  <br />Isn't that what we all want?  Or where we are heading?  <br />  <br />The hero, a 12 year old boy was selected to receive special training which allows him to experience true pain and pleasure.  He later tries to opt out of the system, because he believes being 'human' is something that is different.  Which begs the question that if you don't know sorrow, would you know happiness?  If you don't know or have experienced failure, would you appreciate what it is to be successful.  If you never experience hunger, would you know how lucky you are to always have food in the t   able?  <br />  <br /> Now , more and more, as our society advance, we do start to being able to get practically everything we want, but we think we are doing our children a favor by doing everything to shield them from the bad things that we as parents also have experienced before.  We shield them from pain, from hunger, from anything inconvenient or anything closely resembling hard work?  <br />  <br />Are we therefore using technology the right way?  Is that how we envision technology to increasingly play in our lives - shield us from the real challenges of the world?  <br />  <br />by: wilson ng  <br />My blog at :  [...]
B000O77SOK|5.0|I received Season 1 last week. I love it! I never missed this show when it was in Prime time and still watch reruns almost daily on tv. Now Season One is finally on DVD. Thia is one of the best Series out there. You have suspense, law, romance, friendship, triumph and tragedy. What more could one ask for? I hope it does not take long for the other Seasons of The Practice to come out on DVD. Fans have waited long enough. Get us the rest of the Seasons please!
B000000993|2.0|The riffs are good and simple with low driving bass lines, and the drums are decent, the pictures in the album are pulp fiction to me and the song \\"sober\\" is probably the most offbeat and power-ridden song on all their albums.  I gave the album 2 stars because of my doing research into their band and found out that they are a bunch of intellects-- they are way too smart to be in heavy metal rock prog... blah blah blah. Ultimately  I threw the album away.
0375847227|5.0|This trilogy is incredible, no doubt about it, with well developed and dynamic characters, amazing action and incredible world development. It is everything I look for in a fantasy. For me it gets five stars hands down, but I just want to caution other readers that there is some heavily religious subject matter and some readers may find it upsetting or unsettling. Also, I would not read this to a six year old as a bedtime story. Some of the events in the trilogy might disturb younger children so I would keep it strictly young adult to adult, even if your little one is capable of reading at this level. Still, it is a wonderful read and I am looking forward to seeing how it plays out in film.
B000BVRWJA|5.0|This watch is definitely an eye catcher. Great value. Excellent entry level swiss watch.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|After listening to this album several times, I have come to the conclusion (unwilling at first) that this is one of Dream Theater's best releases, right below \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Scenes From A Memory.\\" As mentioned by other reviewers, it contains a large mixture of the sounds that Dream Theater has become known for, as well as some newer surprises.   I think its worth going through each song on this disc.       \\"In the Presence of Enemies\\" (Pts 1&2; it will played as one song live) is an amazing epic; yes, several of the lyrics in the second part are a bit cheesy. But it doesn't matter... the composition and playing on this epic are both amazing, and the vocals fit each and every part of the song perfectly. In case anyone is wondering what this song is about, it is based on a manhwa (Korean comic book) called Priest. Several of the lyrics are taken directly from it, or modified from the original print version. Dream Theater does an excellent job of putting this fantasy epic into musical form, and this is probably the best song on the CD. Part 1 begins the disc and Part 2 ends it because, as Mike Portnoy said, it was the perfect song to begin the CD and the perfect song to end it.        Some people have criticized \\"Forsaken\\" for its lyrics and simplicity, but these accusations shouldn't take away from the fact that this is very good song. The riff is one the best Petrucci has played, and his fills/the solo make the song what it is. Aside from the guitar work, Jordan's piano intro is a haunting one, and sets the tone for the rest of the song. A good tune with passionate vocals by James.       \\"Constant Motion\\" does sound like Metallica for much of the intro and verses, but the middle instrumental section of the song is fantastic and in true Dream Theater style. This song deals with the band's direction to some degree and with a band member's psychological state to another. It ends up being a really good rocker that is one of the best on the CD.       I was somewhat surprised by \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" when I first saw the in-studio clip of it on Youtube. Not just by the heaviness of the guitar and other instruments (since Dream Theater has done that before) but by the intense vocals. I got used to them eventually, and also came to realize that this is yet another incredible song. Like \\"Constant Motion,\\" and actually like most of the tracks on this CD, it is the instrumental section in the middle of the song that raises it from good to amazing. It sounds similar to \\"The Dance of Eternity,\\" not necessarily in terms of notes but in terms of the fractured, anything-goes type feel that comes from all the rhythm changes and ridiculous piano/guitar riffs. The solo is amazingly fast, and the song has a nice outro as well (with a nice improv continuum solo by Jordan).    \\"Repentance\\" is an interesting song, and one that took me a couple listens to really appreciate. It is a Pink-Floyd style epic, and can be a bit boring at times. However, the soft guitar and keyboards in the first half of the song provide an excellent sonic background and a definite (and in my opinion, good) contrast to the heaviness of \\"The Glass Prison,\\" \\"This Dying Soul,\\" and \\"The Root of All Evil.\\" They fit the subject matter of the song as well. The second half of the song begins after an amazing lyrical solo by Petrucci (yes Gilmour fans, there are vague similarities), and isn't as good but still fascinating. It is fun trying to figure out which voice belongs to which guest singer... and other than that this song is really to relax to. It comes at the perfect point in the album as well, right after and right before more typical Dream Theater insanity.       \\"Prophets of War\\" is the weakest track on this CD, but it is still a good song. James Labrie's vocals (the only ones he wrote on this CD) are very relevant, and get his message across effectively. The heaviness and background vocals are what make this song a good one, aside from the lyrics. What is there to not like about this song? The keyboard riff, a bit too similar to Never Enough (and Muse, according to many people... I haven't listened to them before), and I guess the simplicity of this tune. I like it when Dream Theater does more complex song structures, as well as more instrumental sections, because those are definitely their strengths. Well, moving on to the next song...       This is probably my favorite song on the album, \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls.\\" It begins as a ballad, the lyrics and vocals are very powerful and fascinating... it is worth looking up what this song is about. This song is simply amazing from start to finish... the solos are two of the best I have ever heard, and the guitar melody in the last part of the song is the perfect way to end it. There is nothing else to say... you have to hear it.    So that pretty much sums up the entire album... I like it about as much as \\"Awake,\\" less than their best two albums (mentioned above), and more than \\"Octavarium,\\" \\"Train of Thought,\\" \\"Six Degrees...,\\" and \\"Falling into Infinity.\\" Overall, it is another step forward into history for Dream Theater... another amazing progressive metal album. I highly recommend it.

B000N6TX1I|5.0|What an amazing film.  The film open with the sad and shocking state of humanity, which is that we cannot concieve.  No children have been born for 20 years, and civilisation is in tatters, with London holding on by becoming a facist state.  The story here is overwhelming at times and extemely moving later.  The cinematoraphy is top notch.  Watch this film.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I came here to read the reviews of this 2-disc Edition, hoping that somehow the movie would be some sort of director's cut that would actually exhibit a passing resemblence the the book.<br /><br />Obviously, it doesn't.  I could go on about utterly ridiculous tangents in the movie that didn't happen in the book.  For example - King Galbatrax?  He is only referred to in the first two books, though I imagine we'll finally meet the character in the final book - but, no, let's get John Malkovich in for what was probably a one-day shoot for him and have him chew scenery rather than using the 10-15 minutes of combined shots to say, ya know, follow the actual plot.  Nope, instead, let's skip entire things from the book, including the difficulties of raising a dragon.  Hell no!  Let's instead have some ridiculous lightning effects that has the newly flying, dog sized dragon, mirculously reach full growth in a few minutes.<br /><br />Let's give the dragon the voice of Rachael Weisz (The Mummy, The Fountain, etc.).  Don't get me wrong, I like her work, but it JUST DIDN'T Work.  As for Jeremy Irons, I would see just about anything to hear his silky voice.  If anything, he spent less time in this movie than he did in The Time Machine (which was about ten minutes of time).  Under-utilized is an understatement.<br /><br />I could go on and on.  The only thing that gave me hope was a very necessary and key part to the ending of the book, completely and utterly ignored and changed as to cripple any attempts for sequels.  Hallalujah!<br /><br />Just read the books, and sit around with the rest of us wondering when the final book in the trilogy is released.
0375831002|5.0|I never write book reviews but this special book deserves all the attention I can give it. My own review cannot say any more than all the other reviews but I can say this, the other reviews are dead one.(Sorry for the pun)I cannot understand why this book is not being talked about and pushed as a must read. I promise you this, if you are a book lover and open minded, read this book. It will make you love books and hate books at the same time. You will hate that there are not more books like this and that some of us follow like sheep to purchase books that are all fluff. I will do my best to purchase a few copies and give them to all the book lovers I know.
B0002ZMJ5M|3.0|Good quality Tull material, some quite excellent in fact.  Great production-one of their best sounding recordings ever.
1419359827|2.0|Unfortunately, I bought the CD set, which I believe was narrated by the author.  Big mistake.  The guy is very enamored with himself and he could have condensed the book (CD) by about 75% and still got the point across.    I worked in Sales at Northwestern Mutual and my company pushed us hard to live by this book.  I ended up spending a fortune on lunches and dinners and didn't get quite the amount of business that I had expected.  I think the author must have a vested interest in the restaurant business.    I could probably boil it down to one simple concept ... the most effective way to network is to think about how many ways you can give value, provide leads, or be of service to those in your professional network.  It's like what President Kennedy once challenged the nation, \\"Ask not what the country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.\\"  The same goes for professional networking and that is what this book is primarily about.    The book will cost you about as much as a meal, and then you will spend thousands of dollars on business meals afterwards.  Save yourself the time and money, just be very generous and giving at professional networking events.  Try to serve others and though good karma, it will be returned to you.
0061142026|5.0|I listened to this book as an audible.com download, and it was gorgeous. Neil Gaiman narrates as well as he writes. The voices and tone are perfect. Stardust is a fairytale for adults. The village of Wall sits on the edge of Faerie, and every 9 years there is a fairy market on the border. One day a boy from the village vows to get a fallen star to win his true love's favor. Problem: the star fell on the far side of the wall. There are airships and evil witches and cat girls and talking badgers. What's not to like? In the audible version, there's also an interesting interview with Neil Gaiman at the end.
0307341542|2.0|Gillian Flynn had a good chance for a great book; too bad she missed the mark. Flynn is obsessive in many of her descriptions - Adora's bedroom, the laborious list of words Camille has carved on her body, etc. On and on and on and on - way past when the point is well taken. Good rule of thumb - sometimes more is just more. I don't appreciate or see the need for any/all blasphemous use of the Lord's name - which is plentiful in Sharp Objects. At a loss for useful words in this respect and too wordy when she felt her readers would be too simple minded to understand. If a special meaning was attached to the color pink in this book (almost everything/everybody was either pink or pink toned), it never surfaced - strange! Makes me wonder who edited this book and what was he/she thinking?
B0000YB7Z8|5.0|If you are a Tull fan, I completely recommend this album.  I have been a fan for 20 years, and owned this originally on album and 8-track.  There was an earlier release of this in CD, but poorly mastered.  This version is GOOD.  I have loved it.  It is the entire double-album, nothing editing from the 70s first release.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Beatrix Potter (Renee Zellweger) has just about given up hope that she will ever get her story published.  But she is surprised with the Warner Brothers decided to give her children's story and water color illustrations a chance.  What she doesn't know is that they don't hold out much hope for it.  They just think it is a good project to keep youngest brother Norman (Ewan McGregor) busy.<br /><br />Miss Potter has her own vision for the book and is surprised to find that Mr. Warner shares her vision.  The two work closely together on developing the perfect book.<br /><br />Beatrix had planned to just write one, but at the encouragement of Norman, she begins working on more.  And as the books begin to sell, the two become closer.<br /><br />None of this sits well with Beatrix's parents (Bill Paterson and Barbara Flynn).  Mrs. Potter especially thinks that their daughter should have married into a suitable match ages ago.  And suitable can only mean someone with old money.  But her parent's objections to her new found fame and relationship are about to be the least of her worries.  Can she survive what is to come?<br /><br />The movie focuses on the beginnings of Beatrix's writing career and her relationship with Norman.  Near the beginning we are treated to a few flashbacks to her childhood, but just enough to show how she came to be the woman she was.  And, while some details have been changed for dramatic purposes, the main details are true.<br /><br />All the performances are good and draw you into the story.  Parts of the film take place in the English Lake District, and the locations used show just how beautiful that area is.<br /><br />The ads for the movie showed Beatrix's drawings coming to life.  Over the course of the movie, this happens a few times.  These scenes never overwhelm the film but add to the current mood.<br /><br />My only complaint is the movie feels like it moves too quickly.  I often wished it would slow down a little and explore the relationships more, especially the friendship between Beatrix and Norman's sister.<br /><br />The movie was released by fits and starts around the country, making it easy to miss this gem.

067003830X|5.0|Dr. Doidge does what many others can not do -- write on a technical subject in such a way that all can access and understand the subject. Yet he does this in such an engaging and personal manner as to make the subject so enjoyable. I must state, The Brain That Changes Itself should have a wide audience -- as it has applications in \\"self help,\\" \\"education,\\" \\"personal development,\\" etc. To understand the implications of the material in Dr. Doige's book is to expand our own potentials for problem solving and our own growth. Very cool reading indeed. Roger

B00005JPPI|1.0|FRACTURE has absolutely no energy whatsoever. What seemed to be an interesting premise of a man cold-bloodedly killing his wife and then cleverly crafting the defeat of his prosecutor fell flat in it's delivery. Nothing came as any surprise to those of us who watched it. The screenplay just chugged along with little coal to fuel the fire and create any steam to make this fractured mess move! There is a plethora of truly first-rate actors,Ryan Gosling (way too young for his position as a prosecutor who already had a 97% conviction rate!), Anthony Hopkins (doing nothing different than we have all already seen him do!),Fiona Shaw (what a surprise to see this well known period-piece actress as an American Judge!) and Rosamunde Pike (whose character makes absolutely no sense in this film!); but this film,even with a soundtrack by Mychael Daena (which was conventional at best) just came up dull,dull,dull. The wonderful actress Embeth Davidtz spends most of her time in a coma! What a sheer waste of talent!    Even the overall look of this film was bland, cold and colorless. If this was supposed to create a mood....well it didn't! In fact, the film looked cheap.    The relationship between Ryan Gosling and Rosamunde Pike was very obscure and had us scratching our heads with the proverbial WHAT??? Hopkins has remarkably little screen time compared to Gosling whose story it really is;yet Hopkins received top billing.The entire film was extremely uneven.    Sorry, but something went terribly array with the final product of FRACTURE.One viewing will suffice.There is truly no reason to return and be lulled again by a mind-numbing piece that could have been truly great!
B000OMD4BG|4.0|Honestly, I prefer Elliott's \\"Good Will Hunting\\"-era work, but this album is still worth the buy.  As always it's haunting, atmospheric, and this one hits some raw, punk notes.  Some songs are reminiscent of his earlier musical themes, but reworked.  A needed addition to any Smith fan's collection.

0765348780|5.0|I found this title while searching for something that could satisfy my hunger for depth and grit while I awaited the next installment in GRRMs \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\".  I had begun feeling like there just wasn't anything in the fantasy genre that could come close to the \\"grown up\\" feel of that series and though I enjoy reading the novels put out by other contemporary fanasy writers, I have been deeply spoiled by the refreshingly grey-scale world woven by Martin.  In searching for other contemporary fantasy authors that could engender in me the same depth of feeling and suspense that Martin has, I came across several lists in which \\"Gardens of the Moon\\" (and it's subsequent volumes) were listed alongside the titles that I have come to deeply enjoy.  My first taste of Erikson was a pleasant one indeed.    In this book you will find very little in the way of clear-cut good and evil (even a demon can be cute in this world when it is kept as a pet) but you will find much of the refreshing shades of grey that make the world feel real despite it's fantasy heritage.  The cast is huge and the races are many, and I'll admit it can be daunting at times.  That said, the author never seems to talk \\"down\\" to you or insult your intelligence with ultra-convenient and utterly unbelievable plot twists.  In addition, the book engenders a rare but true feeling of suspense brought on by the fact that the main characters are not necessarily going to make it alive...one of the main things that made Martin's books so great to me.  The question then becomes \\"will he get out of this\\" rather than \\"how will he get out of this.\\"    On the downside, it can be difficult to keep track of what race is what and who is on who's side, but some of that can be attributed to the fact that many of the characters are simply on their own side, rather than backing the cause of one of the main fighting influences in the story.  I also get the feeling that as you continue with this series, much of this will become more familiar as I was much more accustomed to following the goings-on by the end of the book than I was in the beginning.    In summary, with a little grit, a lot of sorcery, some sword and a fair measure of intelligence, Erikson has managed to pen a tale that truly is fit to rub shoulders with the likes of the best the fantasy genre has to offer and leaves the overwhelming majority of his contemporaries in the dust.  And while he's not Martin, he's comparable and he writes faster -- meaning I'll have something to read and keep me happy while I patiently wait for Martin to shuffle into his publisher with the next installment of ASOIAF in tow.  I highly recommend Gardens of the Moon.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Any TRUE Bon Jovi fan will love this CD!  As I listened to this for the first time, I kept thinking how great it will be to see it performed live!  Call it \\"coutry-ish\\" if you want but I think it's AWESOME.  Jon and the guys still ROCK!
B000AXSN5G|4.0|Like Johnny Cash, Neil's been everywhere, man. Which means that the occasional quiet, unassuming, unpretentious country-folk record is perfectly welcome. This happens to be a quiet, unassuming, unpretentious country-folk record. Draw your own conclusions. This is a good record for sure, but it's a couple songs short of being a crowning achievement like, say, After the Gold Rush. It's not overproduced, it's melodic, it's relaxing, there's a horn section that sounds good but slightly out-of-place. Really, what else do you need to know? Oh yeah, what songs are good and what songs aren't. My favorite is the intense \\"No Wonder\\", followed by the longish, reflective title track and the depressed \\"Painter\\" - I also enjoy the quiet, brief \\"Fallin' off the Face of the Earth\\" and the hymnal \\"When God Made Me\\" (though the choir is a bit much). I suppose that, if I was a jerk, I could slag \\"Far from Home\\" for being exaggerated and syrupy, but the truth is I like that one too. It's just exaggerated and syrupy, that's all. Now when Neil opens up a bottle of Aunt Jemima and pours it everywhere, like he does on the Elvis tribute \\"He Was the King\\", \\"It's a Dream\\" and \\"Here for You\\", that's where the problems start to set in. I hope you like cheese, because between those three songs there's a lot of gorgonzola. Good thing that he mostly forgets about the aforementioned metaphorical dairy products and pancake toppings, and chooses instead to go for a quiet, subdued, genuinely heartfelt album in a day and age where self-centered angst means money in the bank.
0735300615|5.0|A magical story with a little bit of lesson built into it. The best part is saying the fun-to-pronounce words and looking at the detailed pictures.
B0000028UK|4.0|Now, there are some very good songs on Vs. Plenty, in fact. The folk-rockers Daughter and Elderly Woman etc. are among my favorites, along with straight-up rockers like Go, Rearviewmirror and the politically themed Dissident. Now when I first heard this, it was my favorite PJ record. A second listen, though, reveals a few of its key problems. Animal lifts the riff right from Evenflow; and there's some amateurish screamfests (Rats, Blood, Leash) that are just one headache after another. I don't mind screaming if it's used tastefully, but if it's your entire song... blah. Then there's the issue of the two \\"extremely liberal\\" songs, W.M.A and Glorified G. Now, I consider myself a liberal, so I agree with both songs' viewpoints. The problem is that neither of them are any good - the former is just atmospheric blah, the latter is another \\"ironic\\" riff-fest. And I can't help but feeling... well, indifferent to the closing Indifference. It just doesn't mean a thing to me.<br />The \\"strong half\\" of this record is strong enough for it to warrant a recommendation. But one thing's for sure: this is NOT Ten.
0805047905|5.0|Definitely one of our favorites, up there with Very Hungry Caterpillar.

B000P2A24W|4.0|This most certainly isn't the bon Jovi I grew up listening to, and I think that's why I didn't give \\"Have a Nice Day\\" a fair chance. The last album was too confusing; half of it tried to recapture the sound from Bon Jovi's comeback with \\"Crush\\", and the other half was trying to go in a whole different direction with country-sounding guitar arrangements. There was no unified sound on that album, so I was very apprehensive about buying this one and finding out I didn't like it (I'm not a big country fan. Grew up on thrash metal.) It turns out that after one whole listen through that I actually enjoy it. Regardless of what I've read about claims that this is not \\"Bon Jovi doing a country album\\", it pretty much is, but it is done exceptionally well. You don't have your usual cliche stereotypical country lyrics here, the album's centralized theme is discovery - where you've been and where you're heading - and Bon Jovi's vocal stylings for this outing fit it perfectly. If you didn't already know he was from New Jersey, you'd probably think otherwise.    If you can't look past the fact that Jon Bon Jovi isn't in his twenties anymore and trying to cram arenas to the rafters with screaming girls loaded with Aqua Net, you probably should avoid purchasing this. otherwise it's an excellent album.
0743298020|4.0|It's no coincidence that Diane Setterfield's debut novel is about a young woman whose passion is reading nineteenth century novels, since her book reads like one.  The story of Margaret Lee and the recluse author Vida Winter has all the delicious twists and turns of romance, mystery, family lineage, jealousy, madness, murder and love. All of the things that you can expect from Bronte, Austen, Dickens, George, and the rest of the literary cast from Victorian England you can expect to get here from Setterfield.<br /><br />This book is well-written and  peopled with believable, complex, and often ambiguous characters.  Also, like much of Victorian literature, \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" has many meta-fictional qualities, since it is a story within a story within a story.  A schoolteacher herself, Setterfield is clearly a bibliophile, whose love for reading often transcends into drawing attention to its own fictionality.  Lastly and most memorably, though is the plot of the novel.  While I don't want to give away anything, I will say that the plot is as serpentine as one might expect it to be, given its influences.  Fraught with coincidence and surprise, I found the plot almost predictable, but in a comforting, coming-home sort of way.<br /><br />I enjoyed this first effort from this author, and yet I expect that her next novel will be completely different,  since she has explored this genre so thoroughly already.  I eagerly await to see what other literary frontiers she plans on retracing.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|Look up the infamous \\"Kung Fu Kapers\\" [a man laughed himself to death at this episode!] episode of The Goodies for the Ecky-Thump reference.<br /><br />Okay, I have listened to this White Stripes album for the last week at work. I have given it a very fair chance. I actually thought that Jack and Meg White must be doing some good things by now and the cover looked good and I liked The Goodies reference. I thought that I should open my heart and mind to The White Stripes.<br /><br />Alas, whilst I could detect some interesting musical ideas and bits and pieces of tunes here and there, the album seem to be made deliberately annoying. I guess that this is the sort of music angry sixteen year olds use to torture their grandparents (their parents would only be bored).<br /><br />The album sounds like a collection of demos. It really does! Stuff done at home before presenting it to a band or taking into a studio to expand and improve the ideas. I don't think anyone could dance to this album, it isn't full of insightful lyrics and the music is not rich and colourful. There isn't much appeal in Mr. White's voice, which sounds quite average to me. Ms White's drumming is singularly unspectacular.<br /><br />It all makes me think - what more can be done with electric guitars that hasn't been done over and over and over and over and over and over and over again in the past?<br /><br />The White Stripes would probably have sounded pretty interesting and innovative in 1969. Today, they seem to represent the current retrogressive state of Pop/Rock music - music that is little more than a \\"cover version\\" of music from the past.<br /><br />Okay, I will listen to \\"Icky Thump\\" a few more times. I am not so closed minded and old that I can't appreciate new music (not that anything on this album could be classified as \\"new\\" or \\"progressive\\"). Maybe there is something in this album I am missing? Perhaps I have \\"failed the music\\", rather than the \\"music has failed me\\"???<br /><br />..... or is this album merely pretentious \\"Pub Rock\\" for Arts students at university?s students at university?
B000P2A256|4.0|Normally (although not deliberately), I tend to ignore bands like Maroon 5. A bluntly commercial band with this much corporate support does not need my backing, so I usually leave it alone and let the marketplace decide for itself. The world at large seems to understand Avril Lavigne, Nickelback and Fall Out Boy a lot better than I do anyway, so voicing my opinion about the musical value of these acts would feel like screaming at the wall. Usually, I simply look the other way, but I've been listening to \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" for a few weeks now, and it has me believing that Maroon 5 can justify the hype.<br />Maroon 5's last album, \\"Songs About Jane,\\" may have been released in 2002, but I didn't hear a note of it until two years later, when the relentless push from the band's backers finally ignited the jet fuel that lifted the band to stardom. Apparently, I wasn't alone in this regard, since the band took home a Grammy award for best new artist three years later, in 2005. Naturally, that brought them a lot of attention, but I figured they would suffer the same fate as many previous `Best New Artist' winners and vanish into the night sky. \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long\\" renders my prediction obsolete. The production is damn near perfect, but in a mid-`80s, Quincy Jones kind of way that often gets in the way of allowing the band to establish its own identity. There is a slick, funky sheen to the best songs, and vocalist Adam Levine dishes out melodies that are flawlessly polished to a full luster. Imagine Maxwell covering a Michael Jackson hit with an ace rock band for support, and you'll get close to the essence of this song collection.<br />The subject matter is also intriguing. There are lots of cheating songs on the disk, and lots of lyrics that will break the hearts of hormone-addled romantics. If his words are remotely autobiographical, then Levine could be the poster boy for the lovelorn, even when his sentiments are shopworn and clich&eacute;d; on \\"Won't Go Home Without You,\\" he knows the girl was right to ditch him, but swears that he needs \\"one more chance to make it right.\\" On \\"Nothing Lasts Forever,\\" he sings \\"I love you but I'm letting go\\" while \\"Can't Stop (Thinking About You)\\" is self-explanatory. \\"Wake Up Call\\" is a bit more blatant - \\"Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed. Don't you care about me anymore?\\" Umm, I don't think so, dude, but don't worry about it, because there are millions of fans to help to ease your pain.

B00005QDW5|3.0|Even though this is supposed to be the \\"Best\\"  of Pink Floyd I would beg to differ.  Right now I have a list in front of me of Pink floyd songs that were unjustly omitted.  On the other hand, there are a handful of songs here- mainly in Floyd's later years-  that are mediocre at best and have no business being on this album.  It's still a sure bet for die-hard Floyd fans, however. The best Floyd albums are The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish you were Here.
0143038419|1.0|I had seen all the good reviews on this book and since I am an avid traveler and reader, I was excited to read a memoir from an excellent writer. I was sorely disappointed.    Foremost, I did not even finish the book which is rare for me. I made it halfway through India before I was so disheartened by Ms. Gilbert's narrative voice. There is a difference between sounding funny, candid and likable and sounding petty, conceited and fickle.     While I was reading this book I was genuinely surprised by the lack of empathy Ms. Gilbert had for anyone. Every situation, every comment, every sidestory pointed squarely to herself and her personal problems. I was shocked that she had lived in Rome and India for months and had not been affected by the poverty and corruption. I suppose if you are so caught up in your own problems and all your own shopping and eating that it's difficult to understand that other people around you have far worse problems. Maybe, just maybe looking outside of yourself and giving of yourself you will find self-worth and purpose, self-worth that goes beyond buying new underwear or eating a gorgeous meal or bragging about having a meditation high.     If you want to read a real journey of discovery, love, Italy and food, I would highly recommend Marlena De Blasi's A Thousand Days in Venice. Her narrative voice is far superior and she reveals larger truths from her personal experiences while getting to really know the local people and appreciating their culture.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|Reunited for the first time since the stylishly acclaimed romantic comedy `Down with Love', stars Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor again light up the screen, except this time they are devoid of the slick, candy coated perfection that made their last outing so spectacularly delicious. However, in the story chronicling the mushy love life of Beatrix Potter, the acclaimed author of whimsical children's stories like \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\", the duo get to continue their onscreen chemistry in a new way, as bumbling and awkward early twentieth century lovers.<br /><br />In Hollywood it is rare and refreshing to find a director who makes films because he is captivated by the story, but for Chris Noonan, who helmed this lush and lavish period piece, `Miss Potter' marks his first feature film since the phenomenally successful 1995 movie `Babe'. While there are a few nods to swine sprinkled throughout `Miss Potter', Noonan's new film focuses on human nuances more so than talking animals.<br /><br />With beautiful performances comprised from the film's stars, `Miss Potter' is an intriguing examination of an important literary figure which is designed for the whole family to enjoy. On the surface an unmarried, thirty-something daughter of a British aristocrat who spends her days not only painting small farm animals, but talking to her work as if they were living and breathing individuals, might serve as a beautiful case study for schizophrenia; however Zellweger's strong performance as Beatrix Potter makes the nuanced character come to life in charming and delightful ways.<br /><br />Of course half the fun of her character comes from her rebellious love for the tradesmen Norman Warne (McGregor), who just happens to be her publisher too. In a film that is filled with lavish, golden cinematography, doing justice to Potter's own watercolor illustrations, it is the moment when these two lovers culminate their relationship with an iconic kiss on the fog filled London train tracks that `Miss Potter' completely enraptures you.<br /><br />The epic challenge for Potter, even more difficult than getting her \\"Bunny Book\\" published, was winning her aristocratic parents over with the idea of marriage to Norman Warne. With a Shakespearean refusal to budge, Potter's parents force the author to seek out other ways for her to marry her true love. When she decides she might have the income to move out on her own Potter humbly asks her banker if she has enough money for a small home, to which he replies that not only could she afford a house, but several estates as well.<br /><br />As fun and family friendly as a great deal of the first act may seem, `Miss Potter' does have its darker moments which is sure to catch audiences looking for the next `Finding Neverland' off guard. When an important figure in Potter's life passes away due to illness, suddenly her entire future is in flux, a plot point which is sure to confuse younger audiences. While death may be an important subject for children to comprehend, it may be a subject that parents of young Peter Rabbit fans might not be ready to broach just yet.<br /><br />For their latest pairing on the big screen Zellweger and McGregor deliver another magical, yet decidedly different romance that is sure to delight audiences of all ages. For his first film since `Babe', director Noonan doesn't seem to be rusty at all when it comes to telling a story on film, and with a little luck we will hopefully get more cinematic fair from him. In the case of his second picture in over a decade I can only sum up the film with this statement: That'll do Potter, that'll do.<br /><br />-Joe Russo, MoviePulse.netompletely enraptures you.

1883217040|3.0|This book is very good and I recommend it to any serious music student.  I learned a lot from it and it gave me plenty of new information and insights.  It is also valuable as a reference with excellent indicies and appendices, for example a long list of contrafacts based upon standard song forms.  My main criticism of it is that it is very piano-centric.  Most examples are given in complex two-handed piano-score format which is great if you can sight read complex piano parts, but are not immediately helpful if piano is your second or third instrument.  Also, examples and contexts reflect the author's own personal tastes heavily.  There is nothing really wrong with these things, but for a book that seems to present itself as the authoritative text on jazz theory, it's not.  I think Bert Ligon's series of books presents a more comprehensive, accessible, and balanced overview of jazz theory, and is more oriented towards musicians in general, not only pianists.

1594489505|5.0|I imagine there will be a huge number of reviews of this book. It's almost impossible to put it down once one begins.   The great strength of this author is in his settings and characters. The two women are real heroes. One wonders how women survived the horrors imposed upon them by the fanatical Muslims. The author takes you deep into the lives of the two, and makes their lives almost unbearable to read. Nevertheless, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good writing, or is curious about how the women live in Afghanistan, or what it means to be under the yoke of the Islamists who demand adherence to the most strict of the rules of Islam.

0385522401|4.0|This little book can be polished off in an afternoon, and I found great pleasure sitting in the park this afternoon with Ian McEwan's new story, watching young lovers stroll by, hand in hand. It is impossible to read this without feeling afresh how arcane and bewildering human pairing and mating seems, particularly to the uninitiated. As Florence and Edward fumble through their wedding night, one can almost see their parents in the shadows and tumult of the bedclothes restraining the couple's zippers and buttons. These two young people have been shaped by the absences and excesses of the older generation; McEwan's marital bed is crowded.The writing is deft, with his perfect imagery and elegant simplicity. This is not his most ambitious work, but it is a wonderfully distilled portrait of two very decent, ordinary people who want to grow ever closer, but haven't acquired a language to do let them do it. When their bodies betray them, shame and humiliation twist what few words they can summon.    The ending was a bit tepid, like drinking yesterday's Breakfast Twining and biscuits,but I highly recommend spending a day \\"On Chesil Beach\\".

B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater's latest three albums (Systematic Chaos, Octavarium, and Train of Thought), though all solid albums by lesser standards than what the band must live up to, had left me a little bit forgetful as to why I considered Dream Theater my favorite band for such a long period of my adolescent life. So I turned back to the albums which started it all- Awake. And though it has been years since I bought the album, and probably at least one year since I gave it a good listen, the album's magic has not worn off at all. With \\"Awake\\" Dream Theater created an album that was so undeniably cool! Heavy enough to be considered Metal, and Progressive to the bone, but lacking almost all the cheesy characteristic that turn most music fans away from those genres. As I listen through Dream Theater's discography once again, I am forced to admit that \\"Awake\\" was probably the best moment for each member of the band (at that time), both lyrically and musically.<br /><br />John Petrucci sounds better on this album than any other. His guitar sounds are crunchier on here than on previous efforts, and the Ibanez he used in these days sounds much better than that Ernie Ball set-up he uses now. He doesn't try to impress with Steve Vai-esque solos in every song, and he doesn't need to. The solos in \\"Scarred\\" and \\"Erotomania\\" should be enough to convince any listener of his talents.  Lyrically, this album includes his best work- \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\".<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, James LaBrie is also a Most Valuable Player on this disc. For the first, and last, time ever in Dream Theater history, his vocals are raw and emotional. He screams the lines that need to be screamed, and when a gentler tone is necessary he delivers it flawlessly. LaBrie is not a bad singer at all, though his voice is often the object of complaint by Dream Theater fans. I think that this is because the rest of the band does not give him room to be himself on the albums, but I will say this- there are few singers that can deliver with the quality of emotion and uniqueness as LaBrie.<br /><br />Finally, this album is Kevin Moore's good-bye album. He was, without a doubt, Dream Theater's most tasteful keyboard player. When he left, the band lost quite a big chunk of it's character. But the band also lost the person who was probably it's greatest lyricist. Moore shines on Awake, both lyrically and musically, more so than on any album he has participated in in the past of future.<br /><br />Awake was a special moment for not only Dream Theater but all of Progressive Music. Dream Theater brought dark, depth, and passion to a genre that is often criticized for lacking it, and since Awake this kind of magic has only reincarnated itself in bands like Pain of Salvation and Opeth. Dream Theater will never make an album like Awake again. Truly, Awake is their masterpiece.iver with the quality of emotion and uniqueness as LaBrie.

B000K1Z3ZQ|3.0|Spoilers Ahead:    This novel is set in the Igbo homeland in what is now southeastern Nigeria in the late 1800s/early 1900s. I read about three-quarters of the book before I began to appreciate it.     Up to then I'd disliked the main character, Okonkwo, an important person in the village whose major traits were harsh anger, pride and inflexibility, finding him one-sided and uninteresting. I felt the description was plodding and little of importance was happening, and wasn't greatly interested in the village life. Much of the novel was concerned mainly with his point of view, and his interactions with the other, relatively minor characters were unexciting. When a dramatic event occurred, such as his accidental shooting of a villager that led to his exile, it was described in a flat, undramatic tone that seemed inappropriate and puzzled me.     I couldn't help comparing this novel unfavorably with another I happened to be reading, Palace Walk, by Naguib Mahfouz, with its complex, many-sided protagonist, the many other strongly developed people in his family, the dramatic interaction between them, and the rich world around them that was reasonably familiar.     It was only after reading some background material that I could begin to understand how Achebe's novel aimed to recreate a vibrant culture that had existed before colonization on its own terms, with its oral tradition, rituals and taboos, and guardian spirits, and show what had been lost. The focus on a period before colonization and the depiction of the whites as interlopers has been called innovative for its time. Likewise the use of language in the words of the villagers, instead of pidgin.     A scholar of African lit, Bernth Lindfors, has described the book like this: \\"Instead of representing Africa as a barbarous wilderness where savages lived in a permanent state of anarchy until the white man came bringing peace, law, order, religion, and a 'higher' form of civilization, Achebe showed how Africans led decent, moral lives in well-regulated societies that placed strict legal and religious constraints on human behavior. Indeed, according to Achebe, things did not fall apart in Africa until Europe intruded and set everything off balance by introducing alien codes which Africans were then told to live by. Europe did not bring light and peace . . . it brought chaos and confusion\\" (quotation from the preface to the Anchor Book of Modern African Short Stories).     At the same time, Achebe showed how some elements from outside the traditional culture, such as Christianity, weren't merely imposed from above but appealed strongly to some of the Igbo, especially those at the bottom of the society, and those who felt the new religion was more powerful. And he showed that the traditional society had its own internal problems and was ready for change. Achebe himself has been quoted as saying, \\"My sympathies were not entirely with Okonkwo . . . . Life just has to go on and if you refuse to accept changes, then, tragic though it may be, you are swept aside\\" (quotation from Under African Skies: Modern African Stories).     The conventional action came almost entirely in the last quarter of the novel, when the encroaching missionaries, together with the trading culture and the colonizers' threat of force, began to overwhelm the village. Although I can't say I identified with the main character even at the end, by then I could better appreciate the loss of the village culture.
0575077859|5.0|I haven't read anything resembling fantasy for a few years after being an avid fan in my teens and twenties (yes that makes me 30 something). I picked this book up on a whim because it was put in a 'Humour' section, and deliberately so apparently. It certainly isn't a book that should be in the humour section, but it is the sort of fantasy book that draws well on broad human experience such that if you picked a page at random you may well think its a comedic book, or another and think you're reading an adventure/war story, another a tragic relationship drama. Overall, however, it is a great fantasy novel with enthralling characters.    It is this, I think that makes 'The Blade Itself' so enjoyable. The writing style sees you drawn into the story from the character's point and you easily identify with them rather than feeling like you're watching events unfold as a observer who happens to know what the main characters are thinking. Further, the characters seem to weave in to the plot that unfolds around them rather than simply being the plot itself which is a criticism I have of much fantasy writing where the greater world seems to repetitiously revolve around the main character(s). Further, the characters generally have complexity, depth and mystery about them that makes them decidedly believable and, more importantly, intimately relatable too.     The other BIG plus for me is that Abercrombie writes in a style that shows  enough attention to detail without getting bogged down in unnecessary explanation. The universe unfolds rather than being spelled out in ultra-fine detail, and this shows the skill of the writer; This will always be a matter of subjectivity of course, but lesser authors seem compelled to 'explain' through their characters the broader setting. Of course Abercrombie has to do that at times, but it is kept to a minimum and avoids anything but essential detail which keeps the pace moving at what I felt was just right. It thus has the feeling of beingan epic without the 'I will now use this book as a door stop once I've finshed' size about it.    Finally, it is certainly graphic in parts, but what I would call pointless or unnecessary gore is rare - if that makes sense.     I would give this 4.5 stars if I could with the only draw back being the lack of any sense of 'tie up' to conclude the book. I understand this is a balancing act, but it would have been nice to feel that there was some finality to the first book to ease the wait for the second and third volume. As it is, it finishes completely open ended, which might be tad annoying for some.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|With a buzzing bass line, thumping beat, and sudden bursts of guitar and percussion (and a squealing guitar solo), The White Stripes announce their return with lead off single \\"Icky thump\\", which is already a UK #2 smash.<br /><br />\\"Icky Thump\\" is the Stripes 6th studio release, and the first since Jack White's detour to his Grammy nominated side project, The Raconteurs last year, and its a plethora of great edgy blues/garage rock songs. The album has a fuller sound than the more stripped sound of \\"Get behind me satan\\".<br /><br />The blues influenced \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do What You're Told)\\" flows effortlessly, while the horn peppered \\"Conquest\\" is a cover (rare for the Stripes) of a Patti Page song; it features fab trumpet layering to give a band effect and a duelling guitar/trumpet solo over a pseudo mariachi rhythm (you can almost picture Jack in a poncho and sombrero).<br /><br />\\"Rag and bone\\" is a power house featuring both Jack and Meg on vocals (his southern drawl nicely contrasted by her whispering) and is brilliant! Just as rocking is \\"Little cream soda\\" with its thumping beat, crashing cymbals, and spoken delivery.<br /><br />\\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\" throws bagpipes (giving a Celtic touch) into the mix, aptly followed by the psychedelic \\"St. Andrew (This Battle Is In the Air)\\", a spoken piece (by Meg) set to percussion and bagpipes.<br /><br />\\"300 M.P.H. torrential outpour blues\\", and the brilliant \\"Catch hell blues\\" are (as their names imply) the most heavily blues tinged songs, the latter featuring interesting tempo shifts (gentle to explosive) and very interesting and exciting guitar work (from delicately plucked, to squealing guitars).<br /><br />\\"I'm a Martyr for My Love for You\\", a beautifully melodic song about an affair with a teenager that can never be, is the album's lone ballad. \\"I'm slowly turning into you\\" is a midtempo rocker with a blistering guitar riff, and lyrics recognizing how alike two people in a relationship become over time. Closing out is the brief country tinged \\"Effect and cause\\" with Jack having fun singing, even giggling.<br /><br />Much more accessible than the dark, experimental (even by the Stripes standards) \\"Get behind me satan\\" (which I loved, don't get me wrong), they are still pushing the musical envelope, something loads of acts seem unable to do these days. Look out, The White Stripes are back!!f country tinged \\"Effect and cause\\" with Jack having fun singing, even giggling.

B0009X7664|5.0|This has got to me, in my opinion, the best movie ever made.  It takes me back to my childhood.  It's poignant, hard-hitting, real and inevitably sad.  Life used to be like this.
B00026W82U|5.0|I'm late in discovering this, I know, but better late than never. Kings of Convenience are Norwegian duo Erlend Øye and Eirik Glambek Bøe, and their gentle, caressing guitar driven folk/jazz with wistful harmonies is highly remniscent of Simon & Garfunkel.<br /><br />\\"Riot on an empty street\\" is their sophomore disc and is simply brilliant! With beautiful delicate guitar strumming pushed to the fore, and subtle piano, banjo and string fluorishes, opening cut \\"Homesick\\" and the delicate \\"Cayman islands\\" represent this fully.<br /><br />\\"Misread\\" is a lilting piano sprinkled jazzy piece which is simply awesome!<br /><br />As pared down as the general sound is, there is (subtle) variety: \\"Stay out of trouble\\" is a horn sprinkled waltz, \\"Know how\\" (lovely scratchy guitars) is a Bossa nova styled piece featuring Canadian folkstress Feist harmonising midway through (she appears again on the more mellow \\"The build up\\"), while \\"Sorry or please\\" (nice jazzy piano and bass, sweeping strings, great horn break) is one of those rare songs (on this disc) featuring audible percussion.<br /><br />\\"I'd rather dance with you\\" is more upbeat, and reminds me of UK singer Chris Rea. \\"Surprise ice\\" is a tender spare acoustic ballad with ethereal harmonies in the chorus.<br /><br />Perfect!!! 6 stars out of 5.

B00005V9IJ|4.0|If you're a fan of Tom Hanks, than this movie is a must-see!  A story of a man who loses everything important to him in his life, because on one fateful plane trip he is left stranded on a remote desert island...for FOUR YEARS!    Much of the movie early on provides foreshadowing for events to arise later.  There is the love story intertwined within Hanks struggle to survive (albeit they are a married couple).  However, like the rest of the film, even that doesn't turn out the way you'd expect!    My only gripe about the film is, I wish they would have shown a bit more of Hanks' on the island.  He was there for FOUR years and the way it was filmed, it jumps from the beginning of his new life, to shortly before he is finally saved.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the time in between.  I can understand however because it was a lengthy movie as is and that would have only made it longer.    Check this out if you can.  After seeing this movie, it'll definetly make you appreciate things a bit more and maybe help you not take so much of your life for granted.
B00000I8UF|4.0|I purchased this album on a whim as you do sometimes sight unseen.  Can't say that I had even heard of Art Blakey or the track Moanin'.  Guess some jazz enthusiasts might shudder in horror at that admission.  Never the less I put it on when I picked it up from the mail and had a listen.  This is a fantastic recording and the music is smooth and classy from the start to the finish.  I think that this album will become one of my favourite albums as it gets better each time I hear it.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|Chances are, if you're reading this, than you have seen the first installment of the series.  Welcome to chapter two; Underworld: Evolution.    The name of the movie really speaks for itself when it comes to the whole essence of the story.  There truly is some evolution that goes on in the film.  This time around viewers are treated to more of what started the war between the vampires and Leicans.  Acompanying this, a whole slew of flashbacks from the childhood memories of Selene (Beckinsale) and what she remembers having seen from her early years.    The viewer comes to learn that perhaps Selene has been amidst the \\"war\\" for longer than she has thought.  Throughout this, you have Selene's own Evolution of thought, as well as truly accepting her fate, knowing full-well that this is what she was born to do.    Along withe the story evolving to the next stage, so does the romance between Selene and Michael (Speedman).  Unlike most movies that tend to over-sell the sex to make the romance seem real, director Len Wiseman keeps it relatively short and classy.  Just enough to show that Selene and Michael have grown enough as characters to truly trust one another and be commited to loving one another.    The action steps it up a notch in this sequel, as well as having its fare share of gruesome killings.  Now, most sequels in general never seem to live up to the original, however, the Underworld franchise (in my opinion) does not fall victim to this.    All in all, this movie lives up to the original name and shows that the story between vampires and liceans has only just begun.
0807014273|5.0|I originally bought this book knowing nothing about Frankl, his experiences, or psychological theories. I simply read the description and a few of the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on Amazon and decided that it sounded interesting. What a life-changing book. Merely reading it at any given time has a marked positive influence on my attitude towards life.   <br />  <br />What's most interesting about it, as Frankl says himself, is that what he's propounding are not abstract ideas developed by some academic at a university or in some research laboratory. He uses his direct experience in one of the most adverse circumstances possible--a Nazi concentration camp--to relate the ideas of logotherapy (his own school of psychotherapy) to the reader.   <br />  <br />In a nutshell, the three most important tenets of logotherapy are as follows: (1) Life has meaning under all circumstances--even the most miserable ones; (2) Our main motivation for living is our will to find meaning in life; and (3) We have the freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering. These principles are put directly to the test, and Frankl demonstrates their validity in a way that no social scientist has conceived of (or been able to) ever before.  <br />  <br />From the afterword:   <br />  <br />\\"Frankl was once asked to express in one sentence the meaning of his own life. He wrote the response on paper and asked his students to guess what he had written. After some moments of quiet reflection, a student surprised Frankl by saying, 'The meaning of your life is to help others find the meaning of theirs.'  <br />  <br /> 'That was it, exactly,' Frankl said. 'Those are the very words I had written.'\\"
B0002ZMITY|2.0|Well, I'm very surprised to see that this movie received as many 5 stars ratings as it did, perhaps my negative reaction to it was misguided. I have to say, and make no mistake about it, Sacha Baron Cohen is top dog when it comes to comedy so that people would buy the DVD is a given. I'm about to get Season 2 of the Ali G show in the mail and I'm sure I'll love it as much as I did Season 1. The only words that I can use to describe the movie Borat are \\"total joy.\\" There's not many movies better, but the same can't be said about Indahouse. As a vehicle for his talent, this flick was a Yugo. I found it incredibly boring and I was extremely disappointed. In fact I turned it off after 50 minutes. There are no interviews (which is what made his show so great) and there is no Borat or Bruno to add to the hilarity. I'd say to take a pass on this one. Actually, if Cohen wasn't in it I'd give it only 1 star.
1853260339|5.0|This was the first sentence ever spoken by Holmes, and we could all use it as well, when describing this collection.  This is another review by one of the kids of \\"love my kids\\".  Holmes has always been a joy to read, the action well placed, the humor meshing cleanly with the drama, and the cases truly challenging.  You will not see most of the answers coming, so if you like that kinda thing, this book is not for you.  I agree with the other guy who's review is above mine, in that reading it in spurts is a good idea.
B00026WU82|5.0|I giggled a little bit when I saw that the 5 star to 4 star ratio for this record was 29 to 1 with no negative ratings whatsoever. Well, there's a very good reason for this imbalance; the perceptions of my fellow critics are totally correct. Yes, Highway 61 revisited is every bit as wonderful as everyone says it is. I'm not sure if I'm qualified to speak about it though as I've only listened to it 123,343 times over a two decade period. I do agree though that in life one quickly discovers that many things are overrated--but not this CD. It is unknown how one could improve on it very much. There's not much better out there unless it's Blonde on Blonde and even then it's close. The tracks here are absolutely seamless and the lyrical brilliance (at the time) was without precedent. If we rate songs on a scale from 1 to 100 I'd have to say that not one of these tunes would merit anything below a 90. Had Dylan only released this CD he would still have been remembered as a genius. The making of Highway was something unknown to me until I saw Martin Scorsese's No Direction Home in which Al Kooper tells the story of the recording sessions, and the interview with him became one of my favorite parts of the documentary. I won't spoil it for you but, for the Dylan fan, you must at least rent it. Hearing about the way Kooper stumbled into immortality is worth five bucks or more. Well, I'll stop raving now but these tracks are Olympian in their proportion.
B0002X314C|5.0|If you want to listen to REAL MUSIC, not none of this hoopla that's out now, you definitely want to buy this CD. for me, john legend gives us peace in the midst of a dying musical era along with others like anthony hamilton and musiq. while his first album is pure genius, the second proves that he is capable of reaching beyond the average expectations; he goes deeper with his sound and lyrics. i appreciate his sincere love for music because it's not compromised for a hit record; he has passion for it and, if you ever get a chance to see him in concert, you'll see and feel it too. I LOVE HIM!
B000P2A24W|5.0|I am a big Bon Jovi fan, but I can asure you this has nothing to do with my review, I really love this record is excellent, even though I have to listen like 3 times to \\"You want to make a memory\\", so I can finally make a perfect click. This is an album that has to be with me an seriously in everyones home.
1594489505|1.0|This book seemed a bit long and at times boring. There were times when I wanted to put it down because it seemed to drag on incessantly. I finally finished the entire book and was disappointed. I thought \\"Kite Runner\\" was a better story; I didn't fully connect with this one. I didn't get the impression that Mariam and Laila were extremely close, so I was surprised at the outpour of emotion at the end. At least this story had a somewhat happier ending.     He's a good story-teller, but this book fell slightly short of expectation. I don't care for his constant negative portrayal of Afghans and their culture. I think both books give a one-sided view of Afghans, especially Pashtuns. I wish he'd write more about the positive aspects of Afghan culture, rather than adding to the negative and exaggerated stereotypes that are perpetuated in the media. It's a really cheap shot, but one that many Afghans are using nowadays to get attention because its what people want to hear.
0452281881|2.0|e is a clever novel that attempts to be a satire of a London ad agency.  It is told entirely in e-mail format, and in that it succeeds by using a very clever, modern device to tell the story.  Kudos to the author for his originality.    For me, however, this novel fails to entice.  You have the loony left wing creative talent unwilling to work on controversial accounts, you have the generally nutty creative director, the sexually predatory male cohort, backstabbing and backbiting galore, cat fights among personal assistants, and a big boss who is an abusive terror.  While I know many people who found this book funny and entertaining, I didn't.  I actually found it rather boring and predictable once the story took off.  There are parts that are funny, and sometimes subtly so.  But overall, I just didn't find the story itself that funny or original.    For the clever writing style this novel is definitely an A, but the story itself is unappealing to this reader.
B000274THQ|5.0|Before the Berlin Wall fell, East Germany is ruled by Communist Russia and its citizens were forced to live a lie- a society that is supposed to be based on equality and social justice. Alex Kernel (played by the amazing Daniel Br&uuml;hl) is a young disillusioned young man who, together with his fellow East Germans, are on the verge of a revolution and social change.<br /><br />While walking together with fellow rallyist, Alex was arrested and his mother, who witnessed the scene, suffered a heart attack. While his mother survived, it left her in a coma and for 8 months, Alex and his older sister Ariane took care of her. As East Germany became no more and the reunification of his homeland was completed, his mother woke up. What follows is a hilarious, amusing and at times serious and thought-provoking attempt to shield his mother from the sweeping changes and their altered life as citizens of the newly unified Germany.<br /><br />Director Wolfgang Becker spared no expense to capture a time and place that now exist only in old, yellowed newspapers and history books. The finished product, a film that is not only a realistic social commentary but also a love story between a son and a mother, and the journey a young restless soul need to travel to discover himself.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|Sounding revitalized, Josh Homme and company have returned with their fifth studio album, the lean, mean \\"Era Vulgaris.\\" Coming off the somewhat spacey \\"Lullabies To Paralyze,\\" the Queens Of The Stone Age sound more confident and more consistent than ever. Bookended by some of the band's grungiest work, \\"Era Vulgaris\\" does a superb job of blending the \\"Rated R\\"-era with the more popular, crowd pleasing material of \\"Songs For The Deaf.\\" To put it in short, this is the album that each and every QOTSA fan should appreciate.<br /><br />\\"Turnin' On The Screw\\" starts off the album with a down and dirty, somewhat perverted sound. Referencing \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\" and spouting off cliches left and right, Josh Homme sounds on top of his game. The groovier \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" and \\"I'm Designer\\" make up for what \\"Lullabies\\" was lacking, while \\"3's & 7's,\\" \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" and \\"Misfit Love\\" attempt to reinvent the typical Queens style, with all the sonic experimentation and trippy guitar parts you've come to expect by now. A few misses here and there don't hinder the album too much, thankfully. \\"River In The Road,\\" for example, lays on the cheese a bit with a constant siren blaring through the song, trying to make it sound badder than it actually is. Overall, \\"Era Vulgaris\\" is probably the easiest album of their catalogue to cut through, which can be taken as a good or a bad thing. Personally, I find it's a fun listen, a catchy, somewhat kitschy delivery of Queens' style hard-rock.<br /><br />\\"Era Vulgaris\\" may not be Queens' finest work, but it does serve as a reminder of all that they are capable of. Like all great albums, and every album they have recorded before it, it's the kind that takes a few good listen before it reveals itself. So give it a chance. It's worth the repeated spins, and at the very least, it gives you some silly artwork to chew on while you listen.
006112429X|4.0|This was certainly a compelling read--I finished it in a weekend, when I should have been attending to other things. Although it picked up elements from many school massacres, the parallels to the shooting at Virginia Tech. were eerie, the picture of the shooter prescient. I was taken completely off guard by the surprise ending. Other reviewers have discussed its plot as an examination of parenthood in the United States, and it drew together all the conflicts that mothers, in particular, face in caring for their families. One of the most difficult conflicts to discuss is whether we feel anything other than joy in our children--boredom, dislike, disgust, frustration, hopelessness, regret. I call it a \\"comedy of manners\\" and gave it four stars because many of the characters, particularly the supporting ones, fit well-known stereotypes of suburban parents, teachers, and children from an upper middle class background in a good school. Kevin is almost too bad to be true, his sister almost too good, his father almost too hearty and baffled. Because the other characters are drawn broadly, the narrator, Kevin's mother, reacts to them broadly, without as much nuance as we usually encounter in the \\"real\\" world. I recommend the book without reservation, unless you are particularly squeamish or looking for something light and bright to read at the beach. It's simply riveting. Please don't give away the surprise ending if you recommend the book to others.

051788710X|5.0|Conscious Dreaming was the first book I read about dreaming. Many years later, it still is one of the most powerful books I've read on the topic. The book is packed with great information about dreams and how to work with them, all focused to help empower the reader. Robert Moss is an accomplished writer, writing in a style that is engaging and informative. I highly recommend this book for all levels of dreamers, from beginners to experts.
B0002TKFRM|5.0|This sacd is positively stunning.  I am young.  I was raised on gizmos, gadgets and hi-tech this and that...and for the life of me I can't understand how these engineers back in the 50's and 60's produced such astoundingly detailed recordings.  With two or three mics for the hall and some tube equipment and wham...there you have it...a recording of impressively powerful  pieces of music with enough separation and detail within the mix to keep the listener busy for hours and hours on end.  That and the emotional wallop packed by this recording is second to none.  Even if you have copies aplenty of Pictures, or Night on..., such as I do myself, please do not hesitate to pick up this recording as it is worth every dime.  If you are looking for an interesting counterpoint to Reiner's reading of Pictures or Night pick of Jose Serebrier's recording on Naxos.
B00062ZE3U|3.0|So, here's the thing: After the release of Enter and Mother Earth, Within Temptation decided to release a more commercially geared album that's completely different from their two previous releases. Now, it's not a bad thing when a band decides to recognize a more mainstream crowd; it's only a bad thing when they go about it in the wrong way- sort of like Within Temptation inevitably did.     Now, this LP has some magnificently composed songs that feature the wonderfully angelic and professionally dynamic vocals of Sharon Den Adel...and granted, most people such as myself can pop it into the CD player and listen to the whole thing through, completely hypnotized by its beautiful sound.   Unfortunately though, if you peel back the layers, there isn't much else to be found. Within Temptation has seemed to sacrifice the personality of their songs, that can be heard in their previous releases, for an almost too perfect and beautiful sound and cliché lyrics.     Honestly, the fact that Within Temptation has taken most of the heart out of their songs doesn't bother me too much, considering there is still a beautiful sounding album on hand...but I definitely wouldn't suggest this album to you if you are looking for something filled with deep meaning and lyrics that a writer has put their heart, sweat, and soul into.

0151013047|3.0|Mohsin Hamid's second novel is more polished in prose and stylistic maturity than his first. Using the retrospective monologue as his narrative medium, Hamid has crafted a post-9/11 reflection of a young Pakistani male torn between his adopted identity in America and his ethnic lineage. However, like the protagonist of his first novel, Moth Smoke, the Reluctant Fundamentalist is also part of the Pakistani elite and must therefore be considered as a minor representation of culture and society in Pakistan. Indeed, even among the expatriate community, the character of Changez, as a debonair management consultant, transformed by workplace woes in New York is highly rarefied.<br /><br />The smart play on the word \\"fundamentalist\\" that Hamid employs compares Wall Street \\"fundamentals\\" and \\"bottom-line\\" culture with the simplistic linear reasoning of the religious fundamentalists. But here is where we find the most significant missed opportunity of the novel. Absent from the narrative is any cogent reflection of theological underpinnings of fundamentalists cultures, apart from Changez's decision to grow a beard. Perhaps because of Hamid's own secular persuasion, he has conflated anti-imperialist sentiments of many secular Pakistani youth with \\"fundamentalist culture.\\" However, the absolutist ideologies that radicals such as Muhammad Atta employed were most certainly infused with a contortion of theological logic. Granted that these males were \\"educated\\" in the West but the catalyst in their turn to radicalism was not merely anti-imperialist sentiments but rather a vituperative view of other Faiths.<br /><br />As long as one is not mislead by the cover marketing of the novel and the cursory reviews that consider this a novel of terrorist transformation, readers will find this to be an engaging read of literary value
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Like everything else from Brad Paisley, 5th GEAR delivers and in true country style.  With so many country artists trying to work things from every angle possible, it's nice to see a country singer who is content to stay firmly within his genre.<br /><br />5th GEAR offers a variety of songs that are likely to become Paisley classics.  Ironically, \\"Ticks,\\" the current radio hit from the album, isn't really, in my listening opinion, the heavyweight here. For my money I found \\"All I Wanted Was A Car\\", \\"Letter To Me\\" and \\"When We All Get To Heaven\\" to be my budding favorites.  But, then, the entire album is wonderful.  Even the come-to-be-expected slapstick antics of the Kung Pao Buckaroos, despite objections by some critics, fit this album like the proverbial glove.<br /><br />I have to say that my only disappointment with Paisley's latest was his unfortunate duet with Carrie Underwood.  I found the song predictable in the extreme and one that really did nothing for Paisley or this album. I'm sure Underwood, with her trite predictability, felt differently.  But certainly not a big enough infraction for 5th GEAR to lose any stars.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
0895260131|5.0|This is one of the best overviews of Islam available today. Robert Spencer has certainly done an excellent job. I was fascinated by his treatment of the Crusades. They are so often cited as an example of historic Christian violence, yet the Islamic factor was as strong then as it is today.    I listened to this book on audio CD and found it a bit hard to follow because there are obviously separate text boxes on various pages throughout the book. As the reader would switch from the main body of the text to the text box, it was sometimes hard to keep up with the flow. Nevertheless, it wasn't bad enough to have even lost a star for. This book is so worthwhile it is 5-stars no matter what!
B000P2A256|1.0|...is hyper-produced trash.  If you put this band on a stage, it would flop like a fish out of water when the backing track skips.  The guy has an interesting voice; too bad it's run through a mixing board on every song.  The smarmy, poppy fakeness drips through every track.
015603283X|3.0|I was mostly annoyed by this book. I was drawn in by the characters, which are certainly interesting characters, and I very much enjoyed some parts of the story arc. Overall however, I found the writing pretentious (quite possibly because it was written in Spanish and things are always lost in translation), and in the end I just never really saw the connections. I have lots of unanswered questions. A fairly quick read, and worth checking out if you're a book nerd, but I didn't think it was as great as some others believe it to be.    Found it interesting however that it was the basis for The Ninth Gate with Johnny Depp that came out 8 years ago.

B000GFLAI0|1.0|I know Dylan used to steal melodies way back in his early career, but I can't believe he has gone back to that practice.  I won't go into the details, as a search on any internet search engine will give you the track by track details.  But the fact is, most of this album is made up of songs that were - at least in part - taken from other artists and not credited to them.  I don't give a darn if the songs entered the public domain, he should not have lied and said \\"all songs written by Bob Dylan\\" because they aren't
B000OYC3J8|5.0|After feeling slightly let down by thier previouse album 'Get behind me Satin' I was a little leery of what to expect from Icky Thump. All I can say is that after the first minute into the album I was knocked out by what I heard. It was the White Stripes back with a vengance catipulted by the Blues influences heard on thier earlier stuff but much more refined though not without a whole gaggle of musical suprises and overwhelming creativity that only the White Stripes can record, package, and distribute. What can one say. IT'S ABSOLUTELY FRICKING BRILLIANT!!!!! Take a bow Jack and Meg, you have truly outdone yourselves this time. Bravo!

B000IU3Y3W|3.0|C'mon, get real for a minute.  How many of you bought the DVD for the better sound quality? Now, how many of you bought the DVD version simply thinking that it had concert footage (and I don't mean \\"still\\" pictures)?
B000OYC3J8|4.0|At the end of the nineties with the resurgence of teen pop had enough stranglehold on music of the day, even respectful rock acts made over polished music with the songs loosing their emotional edge in the process. Then as the new millennium started, along came The White Stripes like a breath of fresh air with their credo of only recording songs that they would be able to play live which for the most part limited the band two just two instruments, Meg White on drums and Jack White on either guitar or piano, per song. Fell in Love with a Girl even closed out Rolling Stones 40 Songs that Change the World which was listed in chronological order.    Now on their sixth album, Icky Thump, the duo again doesn't stray to far from their mission statement as the cover is draped again in their trademark red, white, and blacks although the band does bring in some extra instruments this time around. Conquest, made famous by Patti Page, features mariachi type trumpets while Prickly Thorn, but Sweetly Worn, which bleeds into St. Andrews (This Battle Is in the Air), gets a Scottish feel to it thanks to some bagpipes. Despite the small departures, the album is exactly what you would expect from the group with influences of folk, blues, and seventies arena rock but still sounding fresh and new.    But the album isn't a starter kit for recruiting new fans. Even though it comes close with the album opener, the title track that will get your toes tapping, and closer, Effect and Cause, with a nice sit in a circle and jam type a vibe to it, the disk doesn't feature anything as easily accessible as Fell in Love with a Girl, Seven Nation Army, or My Doorbell. But I am sure true music fans do not care and will enjoy the album anyways.

1594489505|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. For a pretty avid book reader, I can say that it was probably the best book I've ever read-with \\"Kite Runner\\" likely being the second best. I was fully engrossed in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" from the moment I picked it up. Never before have I read a book that I did not want to put down, even to sleep. Hosseini's story of Mariam and Laila is beautifully told. I cannot wait until my family and friends read the book so I can gush about it some more! I am even considering reading it again--I have never been this moved by a book. I give this book my full recommendation. Bravo!
0465043577|5.0|This book should be required reading for all of Wall Street's money managers. It would have saved billions of their clients' money.<br /><br />Let's look at the Long Term Capital disaster. Intelligent people, Nobel laureates, so what went wrong? The answer is simple: fat tails! (The concept that supposedly one-in-a-billion events are, in fact, not unusual). Clearly, it was not lack of intelligence that caused their downfall, but a childish reliance on flawed financial theories.<br /><br />Mandelbrot identifies and explains the flaws. True, he does not provide an alternative theory, but perhaps the whole point is that financial markets, being chaotic systems, are not predictable.<br /><br />Let's look at another chaotic system, the weather. Here the parameters such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, are easily measurable. Yet, we still cannot predict the weather accurately for more than a day or two. How then can the stock market, which is far more complex than the weather, be predictable, when most of the parameters that affect it are not measurable, and some are not even known?<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest part of the book is the beginning of a theory that Mandelbrot tries to found. He suggests that fractal equations produce charts that look and feel like real stock price charts, and that there might be some connection that can be exploited to predict or describe financial markets. He does not, however, go beyond this suggestion and hopes that someone else would develop his theory.<br /><br />Bottom line: Mandelbrot's \\"fat tail\\" theory explains the financial disasters suffered by many \\"brilliant\\" money managers. It does not predict the market, but explains the risks of conventional capital market theories. It saves you money, and after all a penny saved is a dollar earned.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|It's back!...........Extra! Extra! Read all about it!  New White Stripes Album OWNS!  *excited look*  This isn't some lame attempt to be poppy or to appease the masses, this is raw, original, downright ROCK!  Jack White's talents are right on the money, nasty slides, great riffs, with his unique vocals to back it up.  This is such a vintage effort here with a twist of \\"expanding horizons\\".  Bringin' back the old is what it's all about, and made the sound so original.  Explore the rock Ladies and Gents.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Good action with great special effects. Cage plays a motorcycle stunt driver that finds he has the power to fight evil minions, even when they have super powers. This is very enjoyable but not quite the caliber of X-Men, Hellboy, or Fantastic Four. I think the reason is it doesn't have quite the story depth as the more popular ones. Notheless I certainly enjoyed Nicholas Cage, Raquel Alessi, and Sam Elliott in this newest comic to screen movie. More so than the Spiderman series which I think is partly since I personally think Tobey McGuire is to wimpy for the role. Cage plays Ghost Rider tough and it pays off. Everyone does a good job and the effects are excellent. Music rocks and so does the movie. I think this may appeal to guys slightly more than ladies, but Cage will at least get their eye. Unfortunately my wife didn't find it as entertaining as me. She liked him better in Con Air. Worst of all I notice that fans of this movie can't handle constructive criticism so they vote down anyone that doesn't agree with them that this is the best movie ever made.
1582701709|5.0|It's excellent, and has done an excellent job in bringing Charles Haanel's work to public attention. Isn't it interesting that you get such a wide range of passionate reviews about this! What does that tell you? It tells me that there are a hell of a lot of people out there who can't figure out the Law of Attraction. It works - all the time, and you can't escape it. So, ranting and railing against this book isn't going to change anything for you. Working with it can change everything - as I have discovered. But we  attract books like this for very specific purposes, and sometimes we have some things to learn before we can make use of them - if we want to or choose to. I have found that I needed help to re-programme myself to even start letting the Law of Attraction work for me positively. If you are interested, I found Olga Sheean's book, [[ASIN:097382221X Fit for Love: Find Your Self and Your Perfect Mate]] was the one that did it for me. I used the Law of Attraction to attract her - an dthen I married her! How brilliant is that!?
B000002J09|5.0|i know that a lot of people claim to have gone to the original woodstock concert, but i really did. and of all the great bands who played there, this was the best. i will never forget their great set. the lead singer and guitarist was a black man who played his guitar left-handed. the best song they played there was a great, great song about somebody named Purple Hayes, who could get into your mind. i think the title of the song was \\"Purple Hayes.\\" unfortunately i have never been able to find that song on an album, but this album is great anyway. i just discovered it, and it is full of great songs. there is one song here called \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" which is about a stairway that goes up to Heaven. cool. and there is other neat stuff, too. get this record. you should. and if anyone knows what album \\"Purple Hayes\\" is on, please please please let me know.
1881273156|2.0|It's nice to read about the experiences of others and find out that what we all go through is so similar (I guess!). However, I'm concerned that while the book gave me a nice fuzzy feeling, it didn't practically help me to get down to my own real issues. Meeting your partner's needs surely means that you're also catering to any existing dysfunction and failing to really address your own issues. Up to a point, this book is valid in terms of getting the balance right - enough quality time, appreciation, etc - but it's dealing with fairly superficial stuff. I still find that Olga Sheean's book is the only one that really cuts to the chase, and helps me deal with my own issues rather than simply observe and sympathize with those of others who have their own path.

B000P0J024|4.0|I was really looking forward to this package for one reason: the DVD. Vol one of the CDs is by far the best and the brief history of each song on the DVD was done well.  My disappointment came when I watched the videos and only the first song was from Vol. 1.  The other songs were from Vol. 3, thus, no Roy Orbison. This group was indeed one of the greatest groups ever put together, but without Roy Orbison they came down a step.  Why couldn't the videos from volume one be shown?  Why not fill the DVD instead of just giving us about 45 minutes worth?  Why hold back anything when it's available?  5 stars would say this is perfect;  4 stars says they're great, but the content could have been better on the DVD.
0385522401|5.0|I've long had the opinion that with all the hundreds of books published and the movies produced that all of them put together hardly scratch the surface of human experience --- because 99% of them sidestep real human experience in favor of the slick commercial junk most publishers demand. Herein the author places sharp focus on just a few hours in two persons' lives and takes most of 200 pages to tell it --- all of it ringing true in agonizing as well as sweet terms. My own life has been more full and complex than average, I dare say; but the main focus of it still remains a few hours on June 17, 1954; those few hours doing more to formulate the direction of my life than anythin before or since. Ian McEwan certainly knew what he was doing writing this great book. Finally, I don't believe his double-disclaimer that the characters are fictional and the hotel doesn't exist. Nobody fabricates this kind of writing.
B00001P4RI|3.0|Some good sounds on this, but he seems lost without his Dead Can Dance team, although his voice, Sinatra-like, was my personal favorite far above her yoddling jibberish.  Still, a good addition to fans of Dead.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|I must say that Megadeth had slightly disappointed me for a while.  After their masterpiece \\"Rust in Peace\\", they kept on declining.  \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" was good, but no \\"Rust in Peace\\".  \\"Youthanasia\\" was slightly worse than \\"Countdown\\", etc.  After a few years, they finally hit a career low with \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" which only had a couple of decent songs.  Then they surprised me with \\"The System Has Failed\\" which, while not perfect, was about on par with \\"Countdown\\".  Proving that it was no fluke, \\"United Abominations\\" turned out even better.  I would say this is my third favorite Megadeth album behind \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Peace Sells\\" although \\"Killing is my Business...\\" is about tied with this one.  The style isn't too much different from \\"The System Has Failed\\", but it's a little bit thrashier.  There's more songs like \\"Blackmail the Universe\\" and fewer songs like \\"Die Dead Enough\\".  As far as commerciality goes, it's somewhere between their underground stuff and their commercial stuff, just as \\"The System Has Failed\\" was.  They're kind of like misplaced transition albums between \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Countdown to Extinction\\". The band shreds like on their early albums, but the strong structures are a bit simpler and the choruses still have a little bit of that sing-a-long feel.  I know people are wary when they see the word \\"comeback\\", but trust me, this is no \\"St. Anger\\" (which, by the way, I don't strongly like or dislike - 2 1/2 stars).<br /><br />Here's my breakdown:<br /><br />1. Sleepwalker - 10/10 - Best song on the album hands-down.  It simply shreds.  The structure is pretty basic, but the solos are wild and the song is catchy as hell.<br /><br />2. Washington is Next! 9/10 - Also, one of the better songs.  It's a little less thrashy, but not totally radio-friendly.<br /><br />3. Never Walk Alone...A Call to Arms - 8/10 - Their commercial side starts to pop up here.  It's slower than the first two songs and it's radio-friendly, but it's catchy enough.<br /><br />4. United Abominations - 9/10 - A rant against the United Nations.  If you've heard \\"Washington is Next!\\" and you liked that song, then you should like this one.<br /><br />5. Gears of War 6/10 - One of my least favorites.  It's a mid-tempo song that is somewhat catchy, but it's nothing spectacular.<br /><br />6. Blessed are the Dead - 9/10 - My second favorite.  The chorus is so infectious.<br /><br />7. Play for Blood - 7/10 - It took me a while to get into this song, but I finally dig it.  Mid-tempo and pretty catchy, but I think it could have been extended into something more.  Once they break into the chorus, they repeat for a bit with some variation and then end the song.  With a better structure, this one could have been great, but as it is, it's just pretty darn good.<br /><br />8. A Tout le Monde (Set me Free) - 8/10 - Call me crazy, but I actually like this song.  This song which has Cristina Scabbia as a guest vocalist is much-maligned, but like the original it's very catchy and it has beautiful lyrics [note: it is NOT a suicide song, to hell with eMpTyV for banning the original video].  It's the most commercial song on the album, no doubt, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  Of course, it's pointless for me to talk about this song since you've probably already heard it and formed an opinion about it.<br /><br />9. Amerikhastan - 6/10 - This is a great song musically and I would have given it an 8 or a 9, but the long spoken passages really drag it down.  The chorus is nice as are the leads at the end, so I still like it.<br /><br />10. You're Dead - 5/10 - My least favorite song on the album.  A lot of people really like this one, so maybe I just to listen to it some more.  There really isn't much to comment on.  It's just a straight-forward thrash song that never fully clicked for me yet doesn't sound bad.<br /><br />11. Burnt Ice - 7/10 - This song is the one that's closest to their underground style, but it's not quite there stylistically.  It breaks from the traditional verse-chorus song format and it's worth listening just for the solos.  Good song.<br /><br />If you've already heard \\"The System Has Failed\\" then you should know what to expect.  It's a little bit better and ever-so-slightly less commercial and I can't imagine someone liking (or disliking) one album and not the other.  They're not identical, but they go hand-in-hand.<br /><br />4 stars bordering on 5for the solos.  Good song.    If you've already heard \\"The System Has Failed\\" then you should know what to expect.  It's a little bit better and ever-so-slightly less commercial and I can't imagine someone liking (or disliking) one album and not the other.

0385522401|2.0|I fully realize that as I am writing this, I am outnumbered 18-1 in the reviews of this book.    Frankly, I absolutly loathed it.     Florence and Edward don't, for a second, feel like actual human beings. I never saw any indication of why these two were \\"in love\\" or why they would ever have gotten to the point of being married.    Edward is married to a woman who pretty much recoils at intimacy and who has made it clear she doesn't want his tongue in her mouth and yet while kissing her, seems to believe she is going to...well...take him in her mouth? Florence suggests, on her wedding night, that she and Edward would be fine as long as he goes out and makes love to other women? Any of this is realistic?    The ending just caps it off. It sounds like a guy with a failed life, \\"talking an ex pretty\\" believing that it would have worked only \\"if\\".    I never got the characters, never cared about them, certainly didn't see any reason they were together and just didn't enjoy it.

B0007PAMR4|5.0|For all those cheese-balls who criticized \\"Dune\\" when it came out in 1984, you're a bunch of goobs! I've read all the books, especially the first two books several times. It is a complicated environmental, political, religious, mythological masterpiece from Frank Herbert.  The movie was poorly-received in theatres because most folks that went to see it back in the day couldn't stand to sit for more than two hours, never read the books (they are heady and complex), and didn't make much of an attempt to really get into the movie.  Likewise, due to having shot way too long a movie, the DiLaurentiis folks had to edit the movie hardcore so it left some gaps.  <br />All-in-all, I was eleven years old when I saw this movie back in the 80's an I understood it just fine.  I came to grasp it even more as I read the novels.    <br />The movie is basically about royal families competing against one another for a substance known as \\"the spice,\\" which represents crude oil on earth.  The fremen are a parallel-Muslim-type culture that lives in the desert where the \\"oil\\" or \\"spice\\" is harvested.  Complex politics and intrigue are everywhere.  <br />The acting is SUPERB! Kyle MacLachlan was the best choice is the world to play Paul, Sting was perfect as Feyd, good ole' Kenneth MacMillan was the GREATEST Baron Harkonnen ever, and overall there was an excellent international cast.  The costumes, backdrops, scenery, and TOTO SOUNDTRACK were all unforgettable. I'm a huge Toto fan anyway (saw 'em in concert recently)...David Paich, the keyboardist and main songwriter for Toto delivered some music that will give you goose pimples.  <br />  <br />I like this extended edition because it shows deleted scenes that add SO MUCH to this movie!!  <br />  <br />Dune is quirky at times with some whispering and drawn-out scenes but in general it is so much fun, so heady, so vast, and despite the wild fantasy world we see in it, it seems believable at times. Fun trip. Worth every penny....  <br />It'sworth the spice to buy!

A Thousand Splendid Suns is a beautifully written, a tragic story of two women growing up in Afghanistan during many different occupations and wars...but mainly this is the story of friendship, strife, loss, and most of all Hosseini's humane writing...It is a must read...a wonderful endearing story, that will last in my heart for a life time! I don't know which one I loved most...I guess A Thousand Suns, as I could put myself in the shoes of these two remarkable women, Mariam and Leila...
B00005JLEX|5.0|Watching Seinfeld through the countless network and cable channels offered these days is redundant to say the least. But watching this now classic sitcom come to life again in it's original and uncut format via DVD maintains the show's quality. This package offers the earliest days of Seinfeld and it feels too unreal that this show started some 17 years ago, but even then one can recognize Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David putting forth a creative front in comedy television. The two were creating a sitcom that was both funny and ground-breaking with the simple formula to tell tales of everday living. Sure, The Chinese Restaurant episode turned into a classic and I wouldn't snub that episode by any means, but even better(as you watch them again)are The Stock Tip, The Phony Remark, The Busboy, The Baby Shower, and The Statue, just to name a few. Jerry Seinfeld was correct when he described his show in an interview about ten years ago as, \\"Real life with a twist of lemon.\\"
B000001I0K|4.0|The Cramps have always been a bit of an oddity to the uninitiated, it would seem. My mother used to hear me playing them on my stereo in high school, with no objection to their rockabilly roots, however she could never grasp why when the college station would show old video of their live shows, they were so over sexed and \\"out there.\\"    There in lies, for me, the joy of the music on this album. while not particularly in your face sexually speaking, the undertones and inuendo seem to float in and out to the pulsating rock beats and the heavy reverb. Drawing heavily from surf rock of the 60's, there's a hauntingly soothing feel to many of the tracks on this combined reissue (\\"The Crusher\\" not being among such songs). A great soundtrack for a late night trip to the drive-in or downtown, assuming that's your thing. The only reason that i dont rate this album at 5 stars is that very few of the tracks have stood out over the course of three full listening session, GooGoo Muck and about three others. A good starting point for those looking for an introduction to the Cramps, but for that purpose i would more likely recommend Bad Music for Bad People, but it also stands as a solid release for those familiar with such music. A word of warning- While often pinned as \\"psychobilly\\" it should be noted that the cramps are not nearly as aggressive as most psychobilly bands tend to be
0385522401|5.0|Mcewan's latest, \\"On Chesil Beach,\\" is the painstaking recounting of the wedding night of Florence and Edward, newlyweds in 1962. Very much in love, but inexperienced, Edward has waited for what seems like forever to make love to her; Florence meanwhile feels an inexplicable disgust for reasons McEwan only hints at. In a single evening, McEwan tells the story of their lives--one reviewer likened it to the thoughts of a typical day, as the mind flits from past to present to future and back again. The retelling is much more disciplined than that, however, and McEwan recreates a time and place with deft, concrete details--the food, the clothing, the cultural undercurrents.     This book is quite different from McEwan's other works. The events are rather ordinary, unlike the eery, macabre, and frightening plot lines of some of his other works. The hostility is verbal, muted, under the surface. It's more novella than novel, with only two characters fully drawn. But McEwan is masterful as always, and although the book can be finished in an afternoon, there are many layers and questions, a lot to speculate about. It's well worth your time.

0618680004|4.0|In his latest work, Dawkins explores the delusion humans in nearly all societies have shared throughout history - that of religious beliefs.<br /><br />In one interesting chapter, Dawkins postulates several possible and quite interesting evolutionary origins of religion that may help to explain why it has developed alongside civilization. He also addresses the absurd notion that religion is the root of morality, and demonstrates how traditional arguments in favor of God's existence are actually hollow products of wishful thinking. The underlying, despairing theme throughout the book is how, even today in the 21st century, religious beliefs persist in complete absence of reason.<br /><br />This is a very readable text; the reader need not be an expert in philosophy, biology or theology to appreciate it. It is an excellent resource for those having doubts about faith and who would like support in \\"escaping from religion\\" (to use Dawkins' own phrase) and thinking for oneself. I made my own break for it some time ago. :)
B000EF7W3Y|5.0|This is an album for the century. If there ever was to be a definitive top 100 in music of all time, then this would find a deserving place among the top 10. Molded from Irish melodies and European rock of the 80's, this is a superb make from the little known Waterboys. And forget gem, this deluxe double album is a diamond. Surprising when you go back to listen to what else The Waterboys have to offer from their rough and rocky career in music. I first became acquainted with them a couple of years ago when I watched the movie \\"Waking Ned Devine\\". A charming movie made several years ago, with the intro containing title track \\"Fisherman's Blues\\". Well I heard it and really liked it, a lot. So I went through the normal routine of checking them out here on Amazon to see what they had to offer. Surprisingly I was dismayed. Practically everything I listened to was hopelessly dated and without good melodies. A lot of it was just a load of electric sound. And then in the middle of it all, I discovered this. One would double take. I couldn't believe the difference between this and their other studio releases.     The product of a two year stay in Ireland was the crown gem of this band formed originally in London in '81. The whole demenor of the band changes in these two precious discs. The title track alone is enough to make believers out of those who love music, but it just keeps comming and there's such a variation. Every song has something different to offer. \\"We Will Not Be Lovers\\" is ominous, plagued with repetitious fiddle scratches that could have been overboard and may still be for some, but a very vigorous 7 min track. This I think, is close to what their non 'Irish' sound is like. But its still a good track. What follows is a gentle sea tune called \\"Strange Boat\\". I think Ireland's soothing qualities in surroundings were clearly at work with The Waterboys on this one. A complete 180 from the previous track. Probably the second best one on this disc. Next its back to bedlam with rigorous \\"World Party\\". Loud and electric. If you don't like it, skip to \\"Sweet Thing\\". This song has been done over by many great artists, collaborated on by Paul McCartney, John Lennon and Van Morrison while some including me say that The Waterboys' timeless version is ultimately the best, even topping Van's version. All I know is that I like it very much. It really is a timeless love song and continuing with the tradition of these first few tracks, long, at over 7 min. \\"Jimmy Hickey's Waltz\\" is one of a few really charming authentic Irish tunes that permeate this edition. These little outtakes help make the album special. Short and sweet. Lead singer Mike Scott, who is esentially The Waterboys, combines his trademark Euro sounding music with the Irish root influences in the next two tracks \\"And a Bang On the Ear\\" and \\"Has Anybody Here Seen Hank?\\". \\"When You Go Away\\" is very nice and subdued, and \\"Dunford's Fancy\\" is another Irish jig. On the twelfth track, Mike Scott does something special, singing \\"The Stolen Child\\" accompanied with this really great old authentic Irish voice. Now forgive me because I can't recall the man's name, but he does an excellent job in this song in a kind of narrating position. Good stuff. There is a bonus track on this disc, which is little more than an extremely short outtake of \\"This Land Is Your Land\\". But a part of what makes this album so charmingly rustic and earthy. And that's just the first disc folks! If you're going to buy this album then its worth it to shell out the extra few Bucks for the next 14 tracks, which are just as good. Beginning with a spirited and thoroughly Irish instrumental piece called \\"Carolan's Welcome\\" that builds until it is positively grand. There are a lot of songs on this CD that are labeled as 'outtakes', but which are really of studio quality. A couple of different versions of songs from the first disc like a slower sea shanty take on \\"Fisherman's Blues\\". \\"Girl Of the North Country\\" should have been included on the original album its so good. \\"Let Me Feel Holy Again\\" and \\"Meet Me At the Station\\" explore Scott's spiritual outpourings, which is the way a lot of his following material to this album turned out.     Some of you might turn out liking the second installment of this magnificent collection better than the first. It certainly holds a lot of merit. I don't know how some people can pass up the deluxe edition with all it has to offer. Simply a must have.    So there you have it. A true masterpiece. So true, this album has nothing to hide. Its completely honest. I'm telling you, this music is so spirited that you'll want it played at your funeral. It really touches you. Be sure to pay it well earned attention.     And thank God for the Irish (and this album).
B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes (and I despise it when people refer to them as \\"White Stripes\\") betrayed us with \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\" The Iraq War was in its second year and all Jack White could give us was 13 tracks, all of which lacked any kind of lurching or even venomous flourishes? The White Stripes almost deserved the moniker White Stripes (without the \\"The\\") after that one!  <br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />But, now, I am here to cautiously declare that \\"Icky Thump\\" is a good step towards The White Stripes gaining back my acceptance. From the title of the album--an obvious allusion to gay marriage and how it still needs to be legalized even if legal domestic partnerships allow the full set of privileges enjoyed by husbands and wives--to track 13, the wonderfully almost-double-baked \\"Effect and Cause\\" (I know it's usually \\"cause and effect,\\" but I suspect White knew that and was toying with the expected order of the phrase), bluesy twang and swirls steeped in bell-bottom heavy bass are welcomed back into the Stripes vocabulary.   <br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />But, as I said, I'm cautious. I'm slow to fall completely for this album. Is it because I'm wary of what their last album did to me and my family? I don't think so; I want Thump to work as much as anyone. And its bombast does build monuments, yet I can't find a place in the palatial screaming brandishes of this album to simply rest my head and close my eyes. Or even to put on some headphones, sit back, and listen to this album. And for an album to not allow for the listening of itself may be an embarassingly overlooked detail, but it's the difference between 5 and 4 stars. And it's a shame. And I use \\"shame\\" the way it's defined, believe me.
B000QUD0LA|3.0|Don't get me wrong.. I love both the book and the DVD. The book is incredibly charming with its wonderful touches... however, had I known that the book was offered separately on Amazon for only 13 dollars,  I would have bought the DVD and book separate. I paid 39 for both and could have paid 33. (minus all the cents) So be smart, don't do what I did.. and get the book and the DVD, just buy in separate.<br />PS: I place at least 20+ orders with Amazon and have a prime membership.. but shame on Amazon for this misleading sale.
B000MV8ABS|2.0|Plot: A kid on a bike, his brother and a funeral home. Then a tall man whos turnin people into some kind of demons or slaves. It had somewhat of an atmosphere to it but this wasnt that great. I mean it was boring, long, and the ending made no sense at all. Low budget dosent have to mean bad but this one was close to it. It kept me watchin till the end hoping something good would happen but it ultimately disapointed. They 'overdid' the music. I was watchin the scenes and it was that continuous loud score playing over and over. I guess it was for the 70s but far from the best horror movie.
1594489505|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner, and was curious as to whether the author would be able to write an equally engrossing second book.  He did, and I loved \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" and the characters.  Have recommended it to everyone I know who enjoys reading.
B000LPS47U|3.0|This student guy is kicked out of his university. Then he goes to another university and he starts workin in the morgue and moves in with another student and his girlfriend and he starts doin experiments with the cat. He think he found some kind of formula for the re animation of corpses. The cat comes back to life and he tries to convince his roomate that the formula really works.. even on humans. So they try it with humans in the lab and it works. It was really funny, much more funny than scary, like the cat they bring back to life looks like a stuffed animal and the dad in the straight jacket. It was pretty good. This DVD comes with a little needle with that potion stuff in it.
B000OVLBF8|1.0|No joke, and I'm not trying to be funny. It really was that bad. The only people giving this movie good reviews are kids and people who lie to themselves thinking that this is a good movie. No, I've never read the comic book, but who cares. People can't use the excuse, \\"well, you just don't get it cause you never read the comic\\". NO! This is an awful movie, period. With or without the comic book knowledge Mark Steven Johnson should stop making movies. He made daredevil horrible and now this horrible \\"film\\" if you can even call it that.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|I was afraid to watch this one for a long time considering what i heard of it. The plot is simple, some writer lady goes to the country and ends up being raped and assaulted by 4 ignorant backwoods types then one when one of them dosent go through with the job of 'taking care of her' she comes back for revenge. It was sick, yes, It was you can say brutal in a way, but i can see something like this happening. I mean it didnt shock me considering ive actually met people like this that were maybe a couple inches away from doin something like that. Theres 2 types of people, normal good people and people that are a couple inches away from doing something sick like this. A bunch of guys gettin together, real ignorant types and then pullin something like this, yea, i can see it. The stupidity of one of them made me sick. He was like just doing whatever he was told. Then came 'the revenge'. Plain and simple, not much else. I cant say i could see someone really 'enjoying' watching this but i cant say it was so bad i wouldnt tell you not to see it. I dont think a normal person would have much interest in this one. People who love horror? maybe. Its a hit or miss.
0385522401|5.0|The strict social conventions of 1962 England coupled with flawed perceptions on how, in marriage, Edward and Florence envision they will frolic in new freedoms, ultimately forges a fateful and very forlorn finale.<br /><br />Tucked cozily inside a lovely Georgian Inn, following their wedding in July 1962, Florence Ponting and Edward Mayhew, loving newlyweds, each bring a lifetime of repressed desire and hidden baggage into their bridal suite on Chesil Beach.<br /><br />Florence is a talented violinist, a master at her craft, a craft she escapes to when confronted by conflict or fear. She is locked up inside of herself, unable to bear disappointing other people or expressing her emotional needs. She is happy to be free of the confines of her well-to-do, but rather dysfunctional family, but at the same time, she grapples with hiding her most intimate thoughts and repressed fears from her new husband. She wants very much to please him, but...can she?<br /><br />Edward is so smitten with his beautiful, lovely new wife, and all the new found upward opportunity that she has afforded him by their marriage. The higher social status of her family and the offer of a secure new job in her father's firm now await him. He also feels that he has escaped a life of confinement; albeit quite a different one from hers. His family struggles with trying to remain functional while dealing with serious flaws and hidden problems. He lovingly looks upon Florence as his deliverance and the answer to finally and fully be free of his pent up sexual frustrations.<br />He is uncertain how to properly seduce her and fears that he may, in his overly excited state, find his great dread of \\"arriving to soon\\" a reality.<br /><br />Both are so very eager to please each other, but also equally impossibly unable to express their innermost sexual fears and desires. This impassable situation is the critical point in McEwan's novella.<br /><br />What really happened on Chesil Beach that night?<br /><br />With superb narration, while sparing information that the reader must construct for himself, McEwan poses some very important questions on lost opportunities in our lives. In the most intimate of settings, the author very skillfully weaves complex truths and enables our empathy by careful understanding of what's 'playing' out in their heads. The music of each is indeed very different.<br /><br />How often we misinterpret others actions, attribute our expectations to others, do not always fully communicate our deepest feelings...out of personal insecurities or repressed fears?<br /><br />How a moment in time can forever change our destiny!ation that the reader must construct for himself, McEwan poses some very important questions on lost opportunities in our lives.

B000P2A24W|4.0|I am a Bon Jovi fan that was a freshman in high school when \\"Slippery When Wet\\" came out, and have followed them ever since, even as their sound has evolved (while still remaining consistent). I have seen them live multiple times during the last 15 years. I, for one, think Bon Jovi is an incredibly underrated band considering its success. That said, I was very dubious of \\"Lost Highway\\". I am a traditional country fan, one who likes a little folk and twang in my C&W songs, and am not a fan of \\"modern country\\" (Rascal Flatts, Keith Urban, etc.). However, I must admit JBJ and Co. have won me over with this album, which isn't so much country as simply a different take on the classic Bon Jovi sound. If you're looking for \\"Slippery\\", \\"New Jersey\\" or even \\"Have A Nice Day\\", you won't find it here. But you may be pleasantly surprised how consistent BJ manages to stay here while exploring new territory. Lyrically, it is slightly better than some previous work and the musicianship (most notably Richie Sambora's slide guitar)is very good here. While I don't think this album will replace \\"These Days\\" or some of my other favorite BJ offerings, the band has crafted a very interesting album which manages to infuse country into a very listenable set of tracks to spend this summer on. So, as a BJ fan from \\"back in the day\\", I give this album a solid \\"B\\". Here are some key tracks (in no particular order of rank):    1. Lost Highway (great opening anthem)  2. Whole Lot of Leavin' (my favorite thus far)  3. We Got It Goin' On (surprisingly good)  4. Any Other Day  5. (You Want To)Make A Memory (it has grown on me lately)
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's Ok Computer is by far one of the most shining achievements in music our ears have ever tasted. It is to music, what Speilberg is to cinema. Exit Music For a Film is melodic acid to my ears.<br /><br />Right on the wall of perfection next to the Beatles White Album.<br /><br />One of the best albums ever created. End of story. I believe most will concur!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am totally obsessed with this album. I have owned it for several years now and I never get tired of listening to it. I even bought the DVD of the concert after being blown away by the CD! True, I am a Baby Boomer. True, I grew up with the Beatles and Eric Clapton. But, for me, that was a very long time ago in so many ways. I am not \\"A Fan\\". I am a normal woman who likes music but would certainly never (under most circumstances) take the time to rate it here on Amazon. The point is, I can't remember the last time I listened to a recording that literally made the hair stand up on the back of my neck! This is amazing Rock and Roll and I defy anyone who claims to be unmoved by the magnitude of this music and the musicians who wrote, and now perform it. I have a new, deep appreciation for the performing artists that Paul McCartny, Ringo Star (yes, even Ringo!) and Jeff Lynn have become; the enduring relevance of the music of George Harrison, the composer; and the deep abiding faith that Eric Clapton is indeed GOD. Eric Clapton was the music director for this concert and the results are extraordinary. Especially wonderful are \\"Something\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" by Paul McCartney and Eric Clapton and \\"My Sweet Lord\\" by Billy Preston. Two \\"negatives\\": a great performance of \\"Horse to Water\\" by Jools Holland and Sam Brown is omitted from the CD and it would have been great if Bob Dylan had been able to be at the concert. That said, this is a great, historic concert by giants of Rock and Roll. It belongs in your library.
B00005JPQP|4.0|The Ocean gang is here for a third time and the cinematic trilogy is in the books. Comparing Oceans Thirteen to the previous two films, Oceans Twelve was slightly less exciting than the first, and this third movie is even less exciting. Letting this third film stand alone, it is a fun, enjoyable heist movie.<br /><br />Oceans Thirteen is slow in the early going, with the re-establishment of familiar characters, introduction of new characters (Al Pacino as Willie Bank and Ellen Barkin as Abigail Sponder), and the formation of the plan for another heist. The setting has returned to Las Vegas, where the night lights and skyline views are treats on the eyes.<br /><br />Although predictable and expected, the plot picks up when the ball gets rolling once everyone is inside Bank's casino hotel. We're rewarded with subtle humor and a bit of excitement when everything swings in the gang's favor. It's a shame it has to end so soon once all the action is over with - just when the movie gets rolling, it stops short.
6304383177|5.0|While the movie was a flop with the audience when it came out in the 30's,  it is a hilarious comedy, lots of slapstick, with Hepburn and Grant at their best.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|I enjoyed the theatrical version but found it lacking. Now that I have had the oppertunity to watch the directors cut it is one of my favorite films. Most of what I would say about it has been commented on repeatedly so I will stick to a few things. 1) No, the movie is not historically accurate, but unless it has 'documentary' stamped across it, who would rationally have expected it to be? 2) All of the actors did a very impressive job 3)Did anyone else wonder how the heck some backwoods blacksmith was able to do such an excellent job defending Jerusalem? (and I know you did, all sorts of people have complained about this in their reviews - thats one of the ways you can tell who actually saw the extended edition from the ones who are just whining) Wonder no more! That and many other important details are explained in the 80 odd minutes that have been added back in. Pay close attention to the begining. Most definitely worth the time to see.

B000DZIGDU|3.0|Anthony \\"Swoff\\" Swofford served in Gulf War One, and then came home to write about it. His gripping book, \\"Jarhead: A Marine's Chronicle of the Gulf War and Other Battles,\\" was quickly optioned to be a movie. Where the book captures the fleeting explosions of adrenaline that briefly hits you between countless days of tedium, the film version really loads up the tedium.<br /><br />Really, this uninspiring true-life take on being a soldier may be the most honest take on war ever filmed. There are no heroics. No moments of raging brilliance to stop an enemy. Just hot sweaty men in a desert, scared as hell and maybe bored beyond it. What that translates to is tedious viewing. War is the long stretches of nothing between battles, and these long stretches form the majority of \\"Jarhead.\\" If you're looking for \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"Platoon\\" or even \\"The Boys of Company C,\\" you're not getting any of that here. \\"Swoff\\" spends his entire stay in Desert Shield to Desert Storm wondering when he will finally get the chance to use his elite sniper training to make his first kill. The kill that never comes.<br /><br />\\"Jarhead\\" comes closest to mimicking the superior \\"[[ASIN:B00005ATQF Full Metal Jacket]]\\" in that the drollness of Swofford matches Private Joker in Kubrick's film. But \\"Jarhead\\" has no payoff. Theirs is a place where no point of view ever happens...what politics there are in the movie will come strictly from your own point of view. The film itself is visually stunning, I doubt if the scene where oil rains down on Swoff's unit in the night, the desert lit only from flaming oil wells will easily be forgotten, or the horrific \\"highways of death\\" recreation. (Google that reference for the background.) Jake Gyllenhaal gives an eerie performance, the emotions bubbling under his facade. (Almost as good as his turn in \\"[[ASIN:B00005JOFQ Brokeback Mountain]].\\")<br /><br />But again, I return to the movie's pace and subject matter. It really is too slow and random to be truly entertaining, and yet its lack of any real point of view makes it hard to really dig into the charachters here. Just like Swofford, you spend the duration of \\"Jarhead\\" waiting for the time when you finally see some action. The \\"I am always going to be a Jarhead\\" ending makes you wish for a deeper explanation as to why.its lack of any real point of view makes it hard to really dig into the charachters here.

0375714669|4.0|This book is about Marjane Satrapi's years in Europe when she went to school. It focuses on her social problems and addictions before she returned to Iran. In Iran she continues to rebel against the strict religious laws of the extremist government but she is far from a perfect citizen.<br /><br />I liked the first book better for the somewhat silly reason that Marjane was a child then; and with that, there is more innocence and you are not forced to confront Marjane as a flawed character (not that Marjane is a villain, she's just grows up with some problems).<br /><br />It is not necessary to read the second book; but it can give you another look at the daily life of an Iranian in and out of Iran - the social effects of growing up with out parental guidance, dealing with a home nation in crumbling condition, and the angst of growing into an adult.
0385522401|4.0|Once again, Ian McEwan demonstrates his sharp attention to detail and clear insight into the human psyche in his latest novel, On Chesil Beach. As newlyweds Edward and Florence share their first night together - a first experience for both - McEwan's lyrical writing reveals to us their unspoken fears about the consummation of their marriage, while also weaving in details about their childhoods, their courtship, and, ultimately, the tragic consequences that await them as a result of their inability to communicate on their first fated evening.    Though this is a novel about sex, McEwan does not limit its focus to merely the act itself, but rather connects it to the larger issues faced by Edward and Florence in their effort to connect with each other. Although Edward and Florence believe themselves deeply in love with each other, their wedding night reveals that they really don't know each other as well as they thought. As each focuses on pleasing the other, both physically and emotionally, they both sacrifice part of themselves. The resulting frustration and disappointment are not, as some reviewers have suggested, an effort by McEwan to glorify the sexual revolution of the 1960s and `70s, but rather his attempt to portray honest and unhindered communication as the most important element in a relationship, without which true love and happiness are not possible. In fact, McEwan demonstrates the harmful excesses of the '60s and `70s through Edward's own disenchantment with the era, placing the novel's only hope for romantic happiness and fulfillment on the virginal marriage between Edward and Florence. He also implies that, while a lack of communication can be detrimental to a marriage, too much of a focus on sex can be just as harmful.    On Chesil Beach is not McEwan's strongest work. The ending is abrupt and unfulfilling, and the actions of the characters are at times difficult to believe and empathize with. While McEwan's description of Edward and Florence's encounter is not gratuitous, some of his details are cringeworthy and provide more information than we need to know. And, since this is a short novel - more of a novella - there is neither the plot nor character development found in Saturday or Atonement. Yet McEwan's well-shaped sentences and carefully crafted passages are always a pleasure to read, and the writing in On Chesil Beach is just another testament to McEwan's finely honed skill.
B000002UAR|5.0|Okay: I was six when the Beatles first washed ashore over here in '64; their records have been a part of my life ever since. Quite simply -- and don't argue with me here -- Revolver is the single best album of the rock era. EVER. And I mean that for both the American AND UK versions.     You're listening to genius from track to track that doesn't let up. It was the album that split the Beatles' career in two -- from the touring, \\"I'm in love, yeah yeah yeah, hold my hand\\" Beatles to the older, more analytical Beatles.    Indeed, the last line of the last song on Revolver, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" is \\"Play the game existence to the end of the beginning.\\" Maybe Lennon didn't know it, but putting that line at the end of that album was a hint that things were changing, and we -- as well as the Beatles -- were never going to be the same again.     Sgt. Pepper was important, but it couldn't have even EXISTED without Revolver at the end of the beginning.     If you're just discovering the Beatles, start here.

Long live the re-emergence of ROCK!!!
038572179X|5.0|Ian McEwan is possibly the most adept novelist of the current era. His craftsmanship is on full display in this, his best developed, book.<br /><br />As a fan of McEwan's canon of work, I think Atonement serves as the best example of his creative maturation. Unlike other authors of this period in fiction, his skill is never over-the-top, always subtly present. One image, the description of pond scum in a battlesight, is breathtaking in its simplicity and directness.<br /><br />There were several times throughout this book that my breath was stolen. McEwan gets it so right so often, it is like taking a masters class in fiction. The characters are well-developed, the dialogue is beautiful and accurate, the history is never over-bearing and the themes are wonderfully crafted. I highly recommend this book!
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|Much appreciation to Susan Eisenberg, Toni Bernhart, and I.H. Gaulard all of whom are obviously knowledgeable and sophisticated opera buffs. Because I am addicted to Anna Netrebko, I bought the set anyway. Alas it was as disappointing as described in the three reviews: the sets were sparce and ugly - Act One looked like a great prison cell. The characters were so much in black: wrong color for a comedy. There was hardly a smile anywhere. Where in the world did they come up with the feathered, mute, cherub dancing around the screen? The whole effect was as sombre as a Mass.    Poor Countess! For her entry she is all in black; severe; plain as a shoe; and also without any sparkle or smile. No wonder the Count's eye was wandering - not that he was any maiden's dream: he looked totally dissolute, dull and boring.     Of course, this has little to do with the voices. D'Arcangelo, Netrebko and Roschmann sang beautifully. Skovhus sang passably but not memorably. But, so what? The orchestra was dull, slow, and often with loose ensemble (The Vienna Philharmonic, no less!)    Over the years, I have often been disappointed with Nicholas Harnoncourt - even in \\"the old days\\" when he concentrated on distorting the baroque. There have been a few good recordings, but this is a real ringer.    Even if you are a Netrebko enthusiast, this is pretty much a waste of your money.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I love this album! Yes, it is a little different from previous albums, but it is packed with great music.  Do not fear, Bon Jovi has not \\"sold out\\".  The songs may have a slight country flavor with the addition of some instruments not normally found on a Jovi record, but it is still the same great songwriting talent that exists on their other pieces of work.  If you don't like this album then you really shouldn't claim to be a fan.

0743289412|1.0|And I thought SK had reached a low spot with \\"Song for Susanna\\"  Lisey's story was the biggest piece of literary feces I have ever sifted through.  I was actually embarrassed for SK for writing such nonsense. All the goo-goo ga-ga baby talk made it almost impossible to read and comprehend what the plot development was, which by the way NEVER occured.  I remember the Stephen King days where if you read the book your hair stood up on your neck...the suspense in Liseys Story made me P.O'd to even be wasting my time reading it.  Has SK been reduced to can-openers as his weapon of choice?    <br />The only reason(s) I finished this 500 page paperweight is it was a Xmas gift from my wife and she had already seen me start reading it and for pure curiosity of seeing how pathetic the story was going to get by the end.   <br />SK needs to stick with what works, good gut wrenching horror.  I am just hoping that the last couple books are not an indication of the demise of a great suspense / horror writer.  <br />  <br />BTB
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Jack White has a lot to live up to. When your band is hyped as the best group of the decade and you are declared your generations' greatest guitar player, you better have the music to back it up. Fortunately for the White Stripes (Jack and drummer Meg White) their new album is mostly great.<br /><br />While \\"Icky Thump\\" has a loose 70s rock feel in places, TWS branch out a bit, throwing a bit of blues, rock-a-billy and folk into the mix.<br /><br />The album opens with the politically charged \\"Icky Thump,\\" tacking immigration. The title track sounds a tad reminiscent of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" from the band's \\"Elephant\\" (2003) album. A great opening, this mid-tempo rocker is filled with great off-beat solos that sound a bit Tom Morello-esque. The infectious, groove-laden \\"You don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do as you're Told)\\" wouldn't have sounded out-of-place on the Raconteurs album. The subdued \\"300 M.P.H Torrential Blues\\" is laid-back but intensifies when the solos kick in. The Spanish-flavored \\"Conquest\\" with its horns and off-beat harmonies may not be a contender to use as a single, but sounds great none-the-less. The hard-rocking \\"Bone Broke\\" is effective, but not really anything that special. The listener is thrown another curve-ball with the excellent Celtic \\"Prickly Thorn, but Sweetly Worn,\\" complete with bagpipes. \\"St Andrew (This Battle is in the Air)\\" continues the use of bagpipes in an off-beat instrumental which is basically like this album's own \\"Revolution #9.\\" Another rocker, \\"Ice Cream Soda\\" has some impressive solos but sort of plods along and rather aimless. \\"Rag and Bones\\" is more by-the-numbers WS but is effective enough. The kitschy dialogue between Jack and Meg White is kind of lame, but not without charm. The slow-rocking \\"I'm Slowly Turning into you\\" is good, if not great. The melancholy \\"A Martyr for my Love for You\\" is really cool, but doesn't really grab hold-of you with just one listen. The bluesy, almost rock-a-billy \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" is pretty out-there, but interesting. The low-key, stripped-down \\"Effect and Cause\\" is a good way to round-out the album.<br /><br />While \\"Icky Thump\\" doesn't see The White Stripes reinvent themselves, they still manage to make another fine album. They are doing what they have been doing for nearly ten years and are still doing it well. Fortunately, while using the same tried-and-true formula, they still manage to mix things up a bit and throw some new ideas into the mix, and everything works, pretty much, in the end.ut-there, but interesting.

B0002EXH40|4.0|I know many believe the older Megadeth stuff is better. I, for one, didnt appreciate this CD until recently. Being a fan since 85 i have a history with them.The songs are stripped down, not thrashed out and the guitar solos are more melodic. The difference between this disc and other Megadeth is that this is more song oriented and there are hooks.<br />Best tracks are the incredible (one of my Favs of all time) 'A tout le monde' and my fav. 'Elysian Fields\\". Also tracks like 'Thought i Knew it all' and the cool 'Train of Consequences' are really well done. Yes the songs are structured but far from weak.<br />This is a polished sound for Megadeth, but this CD hit the point good. Some may see it as more commercial, i see it as accesible. But lyrically it is personal and the songs really kick as*! Just not in a 'speed metal' sense. Very good CD that gets a bad rap amongst their catalog.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Man, the Fresh Prince has come a long way. Here he simply shines as Chris Gardner, a down on his luck dad trying to make ends meet in San Francisco in the 80's. When Chris' wife leaves him, he is forced to take care of his son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), all the while struggling to keep from going under financially. Gardner then lands a dream job as an intern for a major stockbroker firm, only to find out it is a non-paying position. He must come out on top in the program if he hopes to land a paying gig. Meanwhile, Chris and his son are forced to live on the streets.    This film is based on the true story of Chris Gardner and how he, quite literally, started at the bottom and worked his way up. This a classic story about not giving up and fighting for what you want. This is possibly Will Smith's strongest role to date, and his performance is exceptional. Smith brings Gardner's story to life. A story that is full of heartache, despair, darkness, and most importantly...hope. I'll admit this is a tough one to watch..especially for parents. One of the most heart-breaking scenes is when Chris and his son are forced to spend the night in a subway bathroom. As the movie goes on you will find yourself asking the question: How much can one man take?  But if you stick around until the end you will be touched and inspired. Hard to watch? Sure. Worth it? Absolutely!
B000ION23A|5.0|This is a very cute movie.  There are a few parts that I sort of cringe at while watching with my 3- and 4-year-olds because it shows some behaviors I don't want my young ones to learn.  (After all, the movie is rated PG - not G.)  But for the most part, the movie is great!  The script is original, the acting is fantastic, and the animation is flawless.
B000I2J6K0|1.0|Ok, maybe I'm just not cut out for aerobics, but this was complicated!  Before getting pregnant I did the Power 90 DVD's (which I LOVE, but I was concerned the impact was too much with a baby). My biggest complaint is that she doesn't explain the moves.  She just jumps right into a routine, if you don't know it, she isn't gonna tell you!  The DVD has a homemade feel; taped in a`livng room, and a generic feel.  If you enjoy aerobics tapes and can keep up with constantly changing movements without instructions maybe you will like this, otherwise; might I suggest a treadmill or walk around the neighborhood in fresh air and the toning segment of Denise Austin's Fit & Firm Pregnancy.
B000O76T8Q|1.0|Non-anamorphic widescreen and no 5.1 dolby digital sound...what a joke.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I bought this cd thinking it would be good.  After all Brad's last two cds were great. So I was expecting it to be very good. I started to play the cd and was literally enchanted and immersed in the music, the beat, the lyrics-oh my goodness.  This is his best yet! If this cd does not take every country grammy and CMA next year, well I will be floored. What I love about Brad is his originality of subject while staying true to country. The song about finding ticks and the song about still being a guy-well I can only tell you in real life I was the woman in these songs. And the reference in another song to Richard Petty in the old 43 stole my heart (Nascar call Brad and get the rights to play this song-please!!). The Carrie Underwood song is great, just like his Allison Kraus songs in the past. I can honestly say there was not one song I did not love.  I listened to it while walking on the beach on Absecon Island; I will be out there again tomorrow. I was literally dancing, swaying and skipping in the sand with a bright smile on my face. Thank you so much Brad!!! Keep on doing what you are doing. You are a class country act. I thought Tim McGraw's newest cd was very good and would be my favorite this year, sorry Tim. I still like yours and highly recommend it, but Brad beat Tim on this one. Last year I had the great opportunity to see Brad perform at The Borgata in Atlantic City in a small venue. He was phenomenal-awesome. His guitar playing is the real deal. And I love the paisley guitars! Run, don't walk to buy this cd.
B000EHSVQ4|2.0|This film is HORRIBLY inaccurate, historically.  It is, in fact, a \\"nachtmare.\\"  The acting isn't bad, and some of the action scenes, as far as they are *just* action scenes, are good.  However, the historical inaccuracy of the film is just something I cannot get around.  If you like this film, I do not wish to insult you - just please, please, please . . . do NOT think this is in any way actual history, or any sort of fair to middling approximation thereof.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|With all the prosaic 'metalcore' bands clogging the arteries of America's \\"new wave\\" of metal, Mastodon is like a quadruple bypass of pure awesomeness. Their sound is unique and their songwriting skills have reached sheer perfection with _Blood Mountain_. If you are even vaguely \\"into\\" intelligent, heavy music, but have not heard this band, please pick up this album posthaste. For all the enjoyment I continue to Mastodon's outstanding previous releases _remission_ and _Leviathan_, I would trade them both for _Blood Mountain_ if I had to.<br /><br />Mastodon still possesses its brutish, nasty aesthetic that unforgettably scars you, but _Blood Mountain_ is a more ambitious album than the band's previous ones and vastly more diverse. \\"The Wolf Is Loose\\" launches the album with no intro-riff, no part where \\"everything kicks in\\", no effects to generate atmosphere, just a quick deft drum roll and then the muscular onslaught of riffs and drums, at high and higher speeds. This is the only song so straight-up. Beyond the breathless introduction, tracks grow more complex and progressively structured, and the dynamics informed by so much more instrumental imagination. And there's a lot of different vocals on this album, from the Mastodon standard to a whole range of strange other vocalizations, like high-pitched (the finale of \\"Siberian Divide\\"), drunken gibberish (\\"Pendulous Skin\\") and rather badazz clean singing (\\"This Mortal Soil\\").<br /><br />\\"Crystal Skull\\" follows the opener with its blend of triumphant leads, chugging crunch and sections of riffs that sound like classic 70s rock distorted to hell. \\"Sleeping Giant\\" is possibly the album's greatest moment. I get goosebumps during the intro that uses a remarkable slow-build of multitracked guitars, groaning bass, and percussion with string accompaniment (violins and cello). The sense of texture and progression is perfect. The main theme of the track is a haunting, echoic guitar lead and its appearances are separated by the crooked riffs and cool vox like \\"infinite path carved with unrivaled skill\\". \\"Capillarian Crest\\" clomps through mid-tempo before accelerating to a dazzling prog-metal-like instrumental bridge. \\"Colony of Birchmen\\" is the catchiest Mastodon song so far. \\"Circle of Cysquatch\\" is a menacing, frantic and heavy track with a strange interlude of vocoder.<br /> The music is incredibly evocative, as on \\"Siberian Divide\\", where the band toggles between shifting prog-metal measures, and brutal slabs of and tense quiet parts (and an ending that kills). The lyrics, in fragmentary sentences, are wicked -- \\"ice god shakes the earth   destruction of the path   sinking deeper in the snow   eating bark with blackened hand\\". you need to hear it to get the idea. But there is far more. the instrumental \\"Pendulous Skin\\", with its electro-acoustic mix and organ tones, is beautiful in a rough way so it does not at all sound `pretty'. The unintelligible `singing' it sounds very emotional to me. The guitar solo is intuitive and wrenching. Also highly atmospheric are of the mini-epic \\"Sleeping Giant\\" and the stern, adventurous electric melody stroked by strummed acoustic guitar that opens \\"This Mortal Soil\\" (this kicks into one of the awesomest Mastodon breakdowns ever, and rhythmic tricks that would explode the brain of any caveman). \\"bladecatcher\\" is beyond frantic, a superfast thrash-n-burn piece with bursts of scratching noises, punctuated by super melodically charged guitar harmonies. this instrumental stands out as the most surprising track on the album.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity to pick up the limited edition, please do. It features a very impressive, colorful sleeve (way better than just the booklet cover, but basically the same pic) with makes for a physically nicer item in the collection. Also it has a good dvd with the \\"capillarian crest\\" video and very entertaining \\"making of\\" documentary. I think there's some other stuff on it too.<br /><br />Overall, _Blood Mountain_ is different and shows an evolution, but the band has not lost any of its fire or the intuitive metal sense of attack. Absolutely a must-have.volution, but the band has not lost any of its fire or the intuitive metal sense of attack. Absolutely a must-have.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|I initially downloaded this album without knowing much about it, and after the download was complete and I had finished listening to the album all the way through, I went right out and purchased it.  Sounds silly, I'll admit, but an album this great makes me want to give the artist props and contribute to their earnings; plus, let's all just go ahead and admit that sound quality is far better with a purchased album as opposed to a downloaded one.  Taylor's voice is not the greatest that I have ever heard, but she definitely is talented and her songs reflect her passion for music.  Every song on this album is brilliantly written and wonderfully sung.  Even someone who is not a fan of country music can appreciate the time and effort that Taylor has put into her debut album and we can expect to see--and hear--great things from her.    Favorite songs:  Tim McGraw  Picture to Burn  Teardrops on My Guitar  Our Song    Go out and buy this album right now... You won't be sorry you did.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My children loved this book.  My favorite moments during the holidays revolve around having my grandchildren--sitting on my lap and surrounding me--watch this DVD with me.  I turn up the sound so that the appearance of the train at the beginning of the film rattles the plates in the cabinet in the kitchen.  This film is one of my favorite films.  And it's one my grandchildren love too, both at Christmas and sometimes early to late in July when the little ones begin to think about the hope for snow and presents.
0316166685|5.0|Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a beautiful novel that examines the afterlife in a very unique way.  Susie Salmon, 14, is the main character and in the very first chapter, she is raped and murdered by a neighbor.  Once in Heaven, which is specially designed for each person reflecting the things that are important to him/her, Susie spends her time gazing upon the people she left behind on Earth.  She watches her family, friends, and even the man who murdered her.  Susie's omniscient narration allows the reader to know the thoughts, feelings, and pain that everyone experiences in dealing with the loss of Susie.  Ultimately, this story is one about hope and courage.  I read this novel as an assignment for my college literature class and as I was finishing the final chapters on an airplane, I couldn't help but cry my eyes out because not only was the story incredibly sad, but it was also very touching.  It was such a beautiful story that everyone should read.    \\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections--sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent--that happened after I was gone.  And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it.  The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future.  The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life.\\"  --Susie Salmon, The Lovely Bones, pp. 320
0385611463|5.0|We read this book for our bookclub and found it fascinating!  I thought it was extremely easy to connect with the characters, and very easy to visualize the time and places that they were in.  The book had me going through a range of emotions constantly, I was thouroughly impressed with this writer.  I highly recommend this book.
B00006879E|5.0|I love this CD.  Every songs is great.  It is one of the few CDs that I can say that about.  I do not think you will be disappointed.  I am really surprised that more songs did not make it to a single.

0743496728|3.0|Jodi Picoult is a gifted author; however this novel was somewhat of a disappointment. I was immediately drawn to this book and the subject matter. At times her writing is compelling and I couldn't put it down.  At other points in the book I was actually irritated by all the stereotypes of the social groups of kids.  I would have liked to see more depth here rather than  focusing on the idea that Alex would be able to be the Judge in this case.  The ending was poorly written and the reader is left with the impression  the \\" twist \\" she is known for was added just to be controversal. \\" My Sisters Keeper\\" is still her best book, by far.
B00000DR5D|4.0|This is an excellent \\"live\\" (some parts were overdubbed in the studio) album by Tangerine Dream. Chris' sequencers are just simply awesome. Edgar's guitar work is good, but a bit repetitive.    Overall, this album is a perfect sample of the classic Froese, Franke, Baumann lineup. Both tracks take you on an atmospheric and ambient journey into the universe of sound and the opening piano part of track 2 is a memorable tune that was often a staple of piano solos performed in the '80s during TD concert tours.    One of their best recordings from the '70s.
B0000070QS|5.0|Twelve years after the initial release of Wild Seed, through serendipity I stumbled upon a fanspace for Morten Harket on myspacedotcom.  I got to listen to the complete versions of four or five of the songs included on the CD.  Through searches on another BroadcastYourself site, I found several other of the titles.    I realized that I had to have this music and ordered the CD.  I have had it for a couple of months now, and go back to listen to it constantly.  It's like ear-candy, it's pure pleasure and addictive.    This is an amazing body of work.  I've revisited a-ha's music since buying this and am happy to see that Morten is writing more songs.   This can only add to his already great impact on the group.  With Morten's voice, and now wonderful music writing skills, a-ha has an incredible edge in the industry.  Why, oh, why are they not recognized more on this \\"desert island\\" named the U S of A?     The import duty on this is, IMO, ridiculous!  If you want the CD; get it used, get it like new, just get it.  You will never look back, and you will never regret your purchase.  If you come to love it like I do: Spread the word!
0312323867|4.0|After reading the first book \\"Something Borrowed\\", I was really excited to read this one, until I realised that Darcy had become the main character.  I hated Darcy (the shallow, materialistic, self centered, waste of space)in the first one and really thought that this book might be Darcy overload but kept reading anyway.  I continued to enjoy watching her charmed life fall apart and finally get a dose of what she had been deserving for so long.  To my surprise, by the end of the book, she had gotten a little real and I didn't passionatley hate her any more.  So much so that the happy ending didn't completely pi$$ me off. Good book, interesting to hear how girls like her think.
B000P0IW6E|2.0|Maybe I am living in the past, but this album lacks the STING of Lovedrive, Animal Magnetism, and Blackout. I know they are getting old (so am I) but come on. What happened to Mattias's ripping solo's and Rudy is held in check, what the hell. Most of the tunes are freakin' ballads, only 3 songs sorta semi rock heavy, The Game Of Life, 321, and The Cross. They are doing the same thing Def Leppard are doing, putting out lame commercial crap, I'm sorry guys but this album does not cut it, too bad Desmond talked you into this stuff.
0385335482|4.0|This book is really entertaining.  I wouldn't call it laugh out loud hilarious but its really funny to watch her justify her purchases.  It does kind of make you feel sorry for compulsive spenders though.  You just want to grab Rebecca and shake her and say \\"What Is The Matter With You?!!!!\\"
B000P2A256|1.0|I really can't stand this band or this CD. My friend Chinderbugs brought a copy of this to our weekly Sound of Music club meeting and we were willing to give it a chance. You know what? Come here, I'm not afraid to tell you, this is just not a good Cd. It's like someone took the music of Juhmeerohkwy and said, it's just not annoying and polished enough. Now you have Maroon 5. I liked \\"She will be loved\\" because it brings back good memories of me running the show, but I've never liked their other stuff. They just look at you like they are disappointed that you can't make a pot pie like they can. I'm sorry Maroon 5, everytime I try to make a pot pie the crust gets loose on me. Stuff happens. Anyway, if you want a disc that makes your ears bleed and dance like an idiot, get this. If you want to be like me, buy some Johnny Cash underground remix stuff.
B000O75F7C|5.0|porcupine tree is without a doubt the best band since pink floyd stop touring. their live performances , are on a par with anything on a disc.have seen them five times live the last two times at the nokio in nyc. where they opened with a superior \\"fear of a blank planet\\" which was outstanding, and continued the second set with songs from the last eight cd's. blank planet is on a par with \\"deadwing\\" which was the best cd i have heard for years.this is an incredible band.
B000EJ9MTW|2.0|I love rock and am really cool. I do people's taxes on a seasonal basis so I know a thing about TRUE rock music. This Cd was extremely average to me. It's guitars, drums and a very pooptacious lead singer. Whoopteeedooo. Once again I had friends tell me how rockin a band was only to be disappointed at how far it was from Ronnie James f-in Dio. Dio makes these guys look like Rascal Flatts when it comes to rockin a crowd. Some guy wrote about faces melting at their show. I hope that didn't happen because it would have been gross. If anyone ever put on a true rock show, it was Dio in 85. That tour made me want to do seasonal tax accounting. Dio would launch into Rainbow in the dark and it's as if pangea was achieved all over again because Dio brought the world together again. My friend Skip to my ted brought Wolfmother to our weekly D & D party saying that he would take it up a notch. After he put it on, I challenged him to a battle with my Kittyjuggs character, a nine foot tall cat that sprays lysol in other creatures' eyes. He went with Crapchicken, a 30 foot tall chicken with bowel control problems. We fought in the stadium oatmealica. I used my shield of cilantro to win the battle. Though a fine battle, Wolfmother was not the right music for the event. I took it out and threw on Dio. The party was taken to a respectable level. Wolfmother is incredibly average while I just flew over average at 32,000 feet.
B000NQR7R0|5.0|I had searched & waited for a Chingon CD since the Kill Bill movies showcased Chingon.  I was not disappointed.    To draw a more critical eye...  I would have enjoyed more songs like the terrific, UPTEMPO, opener, Se Me Paro.      Overall, the tone of the CD is rather soft & mellow.  The amazing guitar(s) working together, however, create a very rich sound.  This is definately not a dull CD, and lends itself to multiple playbacks.  I've played it alot in the couple weeks I've owned this CD, and I have not habituated to it yet.    Heh, I have no understanding of Spanish, but Malaguena Salerosa is beautiful & perhaps the best song on the CD, Siente Mi Amor is close behind.    Does the CD have filler???  Yeah, but some might enjoy the two duds.  The english lyrics of Bajo Sexto (track 7) and last song, intrumental Cuka Rocka (track 11)....  Neither belong or seem to fit on this CD.  Bajo Sexto is a fine song, but they should have kept it all Spanish.  Cuka Rocka is clearly just filler and just does not work as a follow up act to impressive track 10 (Siente Mi Amor)    Someone fluent in Spanish would be a better reviewer...  My lack of Spanish gives the vocals, for me, a more abstract expression.  Maybe that is why I can listen to the CD so much.    As far as personal bias...  I really enjoy great guitar work found in blues and rock from artists as diverse as David Gogo's electric & acoustic work to Satriani, Petrucci, Dave Martone, or working bands like Joe Bonamassa or Albert Cummings.
0099481561|4.0|The last time I read Hemingway's novels was some ten years ago in Spain. I thought I was pretty cool. I read \\"The Sun Also Rises and A Farwell to Arms.\\" I don't recall what I thought of them. But one thing I do know is that it is sometimes difficult to separate the legacy or mystique of certain writers from the work at hand.     I thought most of the book was very well done. The reality of war was crafted in a way that compares well to more modern portraits of war (\\"The Things They Carried,\\" \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"Deer Hunter,\\" \\"Jarhead\\"). The true violence of humiliation, dehumanization, and violation are hauntingly evoked. There are scenes in this novel that I will not forget: the killing of the fascists in Pablo and Pilar's village, the rape of Maria and the murder of her parents, the death of Anselmo at the bridge. The portrayal of men and women, those who try to hold on to some sort of moral clarity and those who lose their bearings, was brilliant. When it comes to men at war, the book shines.    A technique that I found interesting was the way that Hemingway created the absent character of Kashkin. He serves as a counter point to Robert Jordan and as an example of all that could and eventually does happen. The absent character adds depth to the novel; it gives a skeleton upon which to hang the clothes of the past.     However, there were places in the book where I felt uncomfortable, like watching the awkward intimacies of adolescents.  The love scenes in the book were failures. And I keep trying to figure out why.     One reason perhaps is that they happened without enough development. Like some romantic comedy, the two lovers see one another and almost instantly fall in love. Granted, the entire novel takes place in three days, but every other part of the narrative is carefully developed. Though the timeframe is compact, there is plenty of space in the narrative. The book is nearly 500 pages long. The sex, the declarations of love, the intimacy, it all seems hollow.     In every other place in the novel there is complexity, nuance. But when it comes to romance, to the issue of love, the novel falls into absolutes and clichés. Robert Jordan is too righteous in his love for Maria. He is too loyal, too gentle. They love each other fully and doubtlessly. And in a novel that creates such a real portrait of war and moral ambiguity; complexity in loyalty, politics, allegiance, nationality, and idealism, to offer the reader such an ordinary, pop-song rendition of love nearly justifies skipping every section where one sees the words \\"little rabbit.\\"    Hemingway attempts to integrate language into the story by employing the occasional Spanish word along with an antiquated sort of English, full of thou and  thee. This is supposed to simulate Catalan. But it does not work. It just makes characters that talk funny.    But of course, it is after all Hemingway. And everybody should read it.
B000001FQQ|4.0|All of the music on this CD is really unforgettable and you must listen to it again and again because it is so good.
0099771810|4.0|This book is about two hundred pages too long. On a certain level I understand why the book begins with the Nathanial Zuckerman, with the mystery of the Swede, with the high school reunion... I know that the novel is part of a trilogy. I understand that the opening echoes the WASPy Gatsby. And I am sure that a close study of the opening will reveal some statement on the structure of the American novel. But in the end, I do not believe that the opening--some 112 pages long--really adds to the central story. The opening of the novel creates a lens through which the narrative can be viewed. An attempt maybe to shift the reader's reading. The reader suddenly knows the narrator, the fictional writer of this story; knows something of his world, his concerns. The reader is suddenly not just reading the story as it is, but also reading the story as it might be read or understood within the world (middle class, educated, baby boomer, New Jersey, Jewish) of the fictional narrator. Interesting perhaps, but what of it? And to be perfectly honest, when the writer as character enters a work I am immediately turned off. I am just not as interested in writers as I am in \\"real\\" characters.    I appreciated the insights, appreciated what the characters did and said. The writing was quick and smart. But I kept thinking there had to be more to the novel, that the narrative would lead someplace other than the familiar old idea that those rich white folks ain't so perfect after all.     The narrative, in the end, did deliver--sort of. It created a world in which the extremism of groups like the Weather Underground is placed in contrast to the common order of America. But there is a moment, right in the middle of the book, where the mythology of common America is shown to be no less a fallacy than the mythology of terrorist/revolutionary ideologies. The protagonist realizes this. And it really is a brilliant moment. But that is as good as it gets, and there are over 200 pages yet to go. Everything from that point forward is simply a less dramatic and less engaging restatement of this central idea. Marriage is a myth. Family is a myth. WASP history is a myth. Politics is mythology. Religion is of course a myth. The heroes (if that is what we can call them) of the book emerge as those who release themselves from the yoke of American mythologies. But they're rightous jerks in doing so.     The idea that America is the sum total of its conflicting mythologies is graphically drawn out in the novel. And it never becomes an idea driven novel. In the end I prefer a simple, straightforward narrative. And that is the part of this book that I most enjoyed. All the other stuff -- Nathanial Zickerman (first 75 pages), the dinner party (last 80 pages)--I could have done without.

038572179X|5.0|This is a novel is very well done. If this book is representative of McEwan's other work, his acclaim is warranted.     The novel is divided into three main parts with epilogue at the end. The first and third parts are the longest--170 and 100 pages respectively. The second part is the shortest, but the most visually and emotionally intense.     The first part is domestic. It takes place in the summer of 1935 and we meet the characters and experience their day-to-day lives. This domesticity is believable to the point of tedium. This section stretches on for some 170 pages. There is a lot of internal dialogue, lots of psychological and emotional landscape. Not a whole lot of scene. Not much of anything really happening. I nearly put the book down. It read like Jane Austin or Virginia Wolff or perhaps James Joyce. And I struggle with this sort of writing. That said, this first section establishes the character's relationships and their pre-war world. The first part also establishes something else that I will address later. This first part ends with a violent crime and the false accusation of a young man who is just beginning his life. It is here, some 150 pages into the book, that things start to get interesting.    I've encountered such set-ups before and I wonder if it is wise in a novel to wait quite so long.    The second section is all war and flashbacks to prison. It is visually arresting and emotionally terrifying. It is ugly and painful and all the things that a good war narrative should be. It shows an attempt to hold on the previous world.    The third section is the section of atonement. And, interestingly it reads a bit too much like fiction. Though it is always engaging and well done, free of sentimentality (though it does sometimes come close). I could not help but feel shadings of contrivance, as though the work balanced on the precarious edge between realism and drama. The narrative held certain contrivances and hinted at others--it was at times self-aware. But still good. And if it had ended there, it would have been a fine novel.    But then, in the final small section, the novel moves from good to something remarkable. And though this structure is hinted at from the beginning, it arrives as something of a welcome revelation. We discover the narrator in her later years. She is losing her mind to some degenerative disease and this is her last work. She explains her writing of the novel and her reasons. The tone of the opening sections, though never deeply inappropriate in and of itself, becomes woven into the overall narrative of the larger story that then includes the story's creation. The narrator tells us what really happened to the two young lovers, which is anything but romantic, which is all too real and like any real tragedy would make lousy fiction--it would not fulfill the reader's expectations. It is just a damn senseless tragedy. This final section in effect tips the scale back into balance, redefines the tension between fiction and reality. My jumbled explanation does not do the structure of this novel justice.     It was interesting reading Gilead and Atonement in succession. The interesting thing was the way in which the telling became a part of the story. The narration folded in upon itself and revealed deeper tensions and motivations.

0446615625|4.0|David Baldacci manages to tell a serious story against the backdrop of the nation's capital in a sort of different way. In 'The Camel Club,' Baldacci introduces us to several friends who make up the Camel Club, a small club that is dedicated to uncovering the conspiracies of the government. They are all interesting characters (the leader calls himself 'Oliver Stone') who start out investigating a murder that they witness. This plunges them headlong into a conspiracy at the highest levels.<br />  On the side, we are introduced to another group of characters preparing for something in the small town of Brennan,PA which is named after the fictional president that Baldacci made up. He gives you some details of what they are preparing to do, and you know that it's going to be something BIG. It takes two-thirds of this long book to set up the murder mystery by the Camel Club, and the events shrouding Brennan, PA.<br />  When the stuff goes down in Brennan, the book REALLY takes off. I won't spoil anything, but the story takes some major turns.<br />  Another excellent book by David Baldacci.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I will admit, after the success of Fallen I had my doubts the band would be able to create the mood of the multi-platinum disc or anything even close to it.  I was pleasently surprised.  \\"The Open Door\\" takes you to the place that Lee is in her life. In the midst of heartbreak and on the horizon of redemption and success.  \\"Open Door\\" is a completely different experience than the albums predecessor, it takes you to the next level with a much more literal lyric and an even darker mood.  This album proves the sound is defined by the voice and the well crafted lyric both provided by Lee.    Highlights include the stunning \\"Lithium\\", the uplifting \\"Weight of the World\\" and the radio friendly \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\".  A true musical journey from a voice that isn't going anywhere.
B00005JNX0|4.0|I watched this movie with my mom and we both thought it was really cute and funny.  The penguins are great and some of the jokes are definitely more appreciated by the adults.  The DVD extras were awesome too; there's a Penguin Xmas caper that's great, plus they have behind the scenes stuff etc.  Overall it's an enjoyable short cartoon that's at least worth a look.
B000089RVX|5.0|What can possibly be crowned the voice of a generation, Amy Lee of Evanescense delivers a solid, captivating debut performance.  \\"Fallen\\" captivates the listener from the first listen.  This band, and particurally Lee, are something very special.  Yet, all of the credit can't go to Lee, the elaborate arrangments that accompany her voice are a major part of the overall sound and it's success.      Her voice is unbelivably strong in it's phrasing and power, giving the listner a very visual and emotional experience.  To say that Lee's vocals soar, is an understatment.    While she is at her strongest on the more powerful, musically driven tracks like \\"One Last Breath, Tourniquet and Going Under\\" Lee also shines on the darker ballads like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\".    I would classify this as one of the top 5 albums I own.  Music fans of all genres will be able to appriciate Amy Lee's haunting vocals.
B00008J4P5|1.0|The one star is just to have my review seen.  I can't seriously review inaudible noise.  You really need to listen to the sounds this band is totally ripping off in an offensive way.  Pick up a guitar and you'll learn these songs in 2 minutes flat and never want to play them again.  Death to retro rock!
B000P2A24W|5.0|I absoultely loved the new record.  I went out and bought it June 19th as soon as the stores opened.  I truly loved the songs and the sound of Bon Jovi has never been better.  I am a fan since 1985, I have seen 39 shows and truly love any and all of their music.  My kids, 10 and 8, are also fans and always sing along in the car, they really dont have a choice.  Cant wait for the tour to begin.  I truly think Bon Jovi will be around for as long as they can.  Thanks for great music, great sound, keep it coming.
B0002IU988|4.0|I'll be honest, I bought this CD because one of the songs, \\"Metalingus\\", is the theme song for WWE Wrestler Edge and it was not available on any WWE albums.<br /><br />The song on the CD is not exactly the same as Edge uses for his entrance.  The drum riff used before Edge comes out is at the end of the song here, and the part of the song you hear as he proceeds to the ring is actually over halfway through this version.  So, wrestling fans be forewarned.<br /><br />However it was good to find that I enjoyed the rest of the album.  My opinion varies from most in that I did not enjoy Scott Stapp's voice when listening to Creed.  To me it kept interfering with what I thought was a really good band playing.<br /><br />Exit Stapp, enter Miles Kennedy and Creed's former instrumentalists have found a voice that finally compliments their playing in my ears.  His voice is more akin to Chris Connell than Stapp and together the new band Alter Bridge shows a lot of potential to me.  I say potential because this first album, while great, lacks an indefinable cohesiveness that comes with a band playing together for a while.  All this leads me to wait for their sophomore album with much anticipation.
B0000646UN|5.0|This film is a fitting tribute to the \\"Talvisota.\\" I have a personal connection - my father was among those on the front lines, those that the movie depicts. He was one of TWO men to survive from his unit, and while he didn't like to speak of the war, the movie was extremely accurate from the accounts my father did share. As for the ending, I noted one of the reviewers didn't \\"get it.\\" My dad said that one day they were shooting at each other, and the next they were fishing together. So, yes, the brutal combat ended in the blink of an eye, as soon as word came. Neither the young Finns nor the young Russians wanted to be there, they were just serving their respective countries.    As for the subtitles, I speak fluent Finnish, so I enjoyed the movie immensely. My husband, who is not fluent, wasn't particularly taken with the translation, so I translated for him and he enjoyed it more. All in all, though, I thought this was a fitting tribute to the young Finns who sacrificied their lives, and their youth - as my father did - to serve in the front lines and defend their country. Most importantly: KNOW YOUR HISTORY - FINLAND IS THE ONLY COUNTRY TO EVER REPAY ITS WAR DEBT TO THE UNITED STATES.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I love this album and I love these guys!  One of the only bands around for over 20 years to keep it together.  They write the best music and Jon Bon Jovi has the best voice there is!  This album is amazing as usual!  Bon Jovi Rules!!! This is one kick as CD!
0345440900|5.0|Practical, logical, LOVING advice guiding insecure first time moms through the first days, weeks and months of their baby's life. Hogg teaches you about feeding schedules, sleeping patterns and even how to \\"read\\" your baby's cry. It's like she can read your child's mind. This is not the ONLY book I read. I simultaneously read SEVEN newborn parenting books during that first week of my son's life and THIS is the advice that worked best for me (AND BELIEVE ME authors differ on their views). You don't have to be rigid with Hogg's advice, in fact you shouldn't be. Every baby is different. BUT this book can and will help ANY mother make it through those first few hours, days and weeks with your newborn. Baby Whisperer is about understanding your baby with plenty of advice that works--not rules you must follow. I was so insecure when I had my first baby. My son was born the same time this book came out. What a blessing! Some of this stuff just comes naturally to some people. Not me. I wanted someone to hold my hand. Tracy Hogg did just that. My son was sleeping through the night in no time. She even teaches you how to change a diaper without your baby freaking out--you just tell the baby what you're going to do ahead of time in a normal conversational voice, go figure, it works. Any of my friends who had babies around the same time that disagreed with Tracy Hogg's \\"get the baby on a schedule\\" advice are the same friends who always said \\"I just don't get it, my baby has day and night mixed up.\\" Well of course, if you let your baby sleep all day, he is going to be awake all night. Read this book and have peace of mind.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|Wagner's Ring is perhaps the greatest work of art ever, certainly the most brilliant accomplishment in the field of musical drama. I found this Met broadcast to be an entirely satisfying interpretation. I understand that some \\"Ringies\\" are disappointed with the straightforward approach, the lack of symbolism, but there is already enough symbolism in the story, the characters and the music for a month of Sundays. Don't get me wrong, I like abstract interpretations of the Ring(see my review of the Barcelona production), but sometimes you just want to sit back and enjoy the Ring on its own terms, without any frills, just be immersed in the mythological images and, most of all, the glorious music, and this Met production is perfect for that type of Ring experience. Otto Schenk's vision is appropriately cinematic, literally capturing Wagner's mythological world as the composer probably envisioned it, uncluttered by any modernist touches. And the results are often stunning. The gods' introduction to Valhalla at the end of Das Rheingold is one example, Wotan and company standing in the foreground, with a gorgeous rainbow spanning the gorge between them and their new home, a castle as grim and foreboding as it is beautiful. The conclusion of Gotterdammerung is equally impressive, with Schenck taking the term twilight of the gods quite literally as the whole stage crumbles to ruin against the backdrop of the Rhinemaidens retrieving their lost gold just before humanity arrives on the scene to look on in awe at the dethroned immortals. Only a few scenes are visually disappointing, including a pedestrian Ride of the Valkyries(sans horses) and uminspiring special effects to back up Wagner's very inspiring Magic Fire Music.  <br />  <br />Musically, this is a grand performance. There are too many singers involved in the Ring to mention everyone, so I'll focus on the majors. James Morris is Wotan, and his experience in the role is invaluable to this performance. His deep and haunting voice conveys both introspection and compassion, and anger when necessary, although the viewer gets the feeling that with this Wotan, anger is seldom more than an affectation, he is more of a noble and thoughtful character than a god of fury. His scene with Brunnhilde at the end of Die Walkure is earthshattering. The appropriately named Siegfried Jerusalem is an ideal Siegfriend, dashing, energetic, brash, immature and passionate, with a voice capable of being both stentorian and lyrical. Hildegard Behrens' Brunnhilde didn't overwhelm me initially, but by the Immolation Scene in Gotterdammerung I was completely sold. Though she sings beautifully, and with a lot of passion, she isn't the most strong-voiced Brunnhilde you will ever hear, and if this were merely a sound recording it might have bothered me. But she is as much a physical actress as a vocal one, and you aren't likely to see anyone get into the character of Wotan's valiant lovechild as deeply as she does. Finally, Matti Salminen is Matti Salminen. Among contemporary basses, he owns the character of the half-Nibelung half-human Hagen, possibly my favorite character in the whole cycle, a fascinating study of a personality bred toward evil. No one else's voice, or face, is so perfect for projecting Hagen's unique form of tortured menace. It makes we want to see him as King Phillip in Don Carlo, so someone please get around to releasing one of those productions on DVD!  <br />  <br />Finally, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under James Levine is outstanding. I sometimes find Levine's conducting of Wagner(as well as Puccini) to be too slow, but here there are very few moments where I felt he was dwelling on the profundity of the music at the expense of the drama, he achieves a nearly perfect balance of these two qualities. All the motifs are explored to the fullest extent, and the result is a soundworld unlike any other.  <br />  <br />Buying a complete Ring Cycle is a big investment, so it really dependson what you're looking for. I'm a huge fan of these Met releases, so I may be a bit prejudiced, but I would recommend this one over others(bearing in mind that the only other one I've seen is the Barcelong Ring which is also quite good, though totally different). For me, this one is a perfect fusion of image and music. The Ring is a long listening and viewing experience, sometimes even in the best hands this can lead to some awkward and, let's face it, tiresome stretches, but especially if the music and visuals aren't on track. Here, though, Levine and Schenk and company have achieved something magical, appropriately enough, more than that they have created a Ring that FLOWS, logically, dramatically, from beginning to end. My praise couldn't be any higher.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|Don't get me wrong QOTSA is one of my favorite bands and I own all their albums. I think they are the best hard rock band of the decade easily.  While I commend the band for trying new things IMHO this is the worst QOTSA album of them all and the least deserving of the critical praise it seems to be garnering.    <br />  <br />1.Turning on the Screw  <br />A great guitar riff but jokey lyrics and terrible, off kilter, barely hitting the notes vocals hurt the replayability of the song.  Verdict: Retarded  <br />  <br />2.Sick, Sick, Sick  <br />There's a reason this is the single.  Raw, debauched rocker with a guitar sound that is just plain sick...living up to the name.  This song makes you want to get drunk as hell.  Why isn't the whole album up to par with this song?  <br />  <br />3.I'm Designer  <br />Jabby guitar and clever lyrics make this one of the better songs on the album.  <br />  <br />4. Into the Hollow  <br />This song sounds like a reject from Lullabies to Paralyze.  This is QOTSA for your mom.  Weak dudes, weak.  <br />  <br />5. Misfit Love  <br />Sounds great musically but Josh overuses his signature falsetto here.    <br />  <br />6. Battery Acid  <br />Do you enjoy song induced headaches?  Listen to this piece of crap.  <br />  <br />7.Make it Wit Chu  <br />This is a great song but we've heard it before, and better.  The Desert Sessions version is far superior to this (for some reason) rerecorded version.  Pure filler...what a rip-off.  <br />  <br />8. 3's & 7's  <br />Anyone else notice the swiped Nirvana \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" riff in the beginning of this?  The rest of it sounds good compared to the rest of the album, but that's not saying much.  Wicked guitar solo near the end though.  <br />  <br />9.  Suture up your Future  <br />Awesome track.  Here's where the experimentation paid off.  One of the best songs I've heard in a long time from any band.  Josh's morose vocal stylings and the eerie guitar create a sound from QOTSA we haven't heard before.  This song is frustrating becaue it's a little glimpse of how good the rest of the album could have been.  <br />  <br />10. River in the Road  <br />Pummeling drums are a nice tough.  A little too many of the signature oooooohs and aaaaaaahs.  Couldn't think of any more lyrics?  <br />  <br />11.  Run, Pig, Run  <br />This song probably sounds awesome if you have never heard Songs for the Deaf.  If you have, it's a yawner...besides a cringe-worthy bridge that rachets up the annoyance factor.  <br />  <br />This is a mixed bag album that really doesn't do it for me.  I appreciate a band expanding their sound but this record irritates more than it satisfies.  Except for a few standout tracks here I will just be revisiting the older albums until they come out with something better....let's hope they do.  <br />
B00006CJOY|5.0|If you like Manu Chao you'll love this album! Very good vibes.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Get Behind Me Satan was a grower.  It wasn't all that accessible; it didn't really grab you right away, and it wasn't heavy or bluesy like all of the other White Stripes albums.  And for these reasons some fans saw it as a disappointment, wondering why Jack White left the jackhammer guitar off of the album.  Even though repeat listens revealed a rewarding listen and a refreshing change of pace, it still took a few lumps.      But fans of the accessible White Stripes rejoice, because Icky Thump is a full on rock album, with pounding drums, powerful riffs and blues elements all over the pace.  Icky Thump is like the loud and abrasive brother of Get Behind Me Satan.  The songwriting is still paranoid and strange, but instead of sounding insular, it sounds massive.      The title track starts this album off with a bang, continuing the White Stripes tradition of attention grabbing openers.  The song is a typical White Stripes stomper, with Meg pounding on the drums and Jack throwing in a heavy guitar riff.  But the heavy synth line throughout the song adds a menacing element.  I can't wait to hear them play this song live, it should shake the ground.  Now the flippant one off line immigration is a bit troubling, but the rest of the song doesn't really seem to be about immigration at all, but some kind of drunken trip to Mexico, or maybe it's just nonsense, I'm not really sure.      Icky Thump is front loaded with great tunes, with You Don't Know What Love Is, 300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues, and the mariachi tinged Conquest all very solid tunes.  The album does lag a bit in the middle with the two Scottish folk tunes, but they're not terrible songs or anything, they just don't have the same energy as the first part of the album.      The second half of the album is also great.  Rag and Bone is a fun little song about two junk dealers and Catch Hell Blues is a heavy blues number in the tradition of Death Letter.      Fans of the band are going to love this.  All of the elements are there, the heavy guitar riffs, the pounding drums, the red and white color scheme, the goofy clothing, and even the strange liner notes.  I don't think it's as good as Elephant, or De Stijl, but it's a fun album with some genuinely great moments.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|My sister and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  The acting is top-notch and the adaptation is generally faithful to the book.  However, given that I knew that Gaskell was a Unitarian and an early feminist, I knew that one of the early scenes could not have been in the book; Gaskell would never have had her heroine become romantically attached to a man who could behave in that way. Sure enough, when I read the book, I discovered that I was right. This scene is not in the book and the eventual outcome makes much more sense without it. This is the major divergence from the text.  The others are minor and don't affect the plausibility of the plot. If you want to know what the false scene is, scroll to the end of the review.     Partly due to Margaret's influence, Mr. Thornton evolves from an employer who resents the workers' demands and can't see their point of view to an employer who begins to try to understand and help them.  This is not to say that he does a 180.  Rather, he comes to have some empathy for them. For her part, Margaret starts out as a crusader, but when the workers' strike turns ugly, she too starts to see that the moral issues are more complex than she had thought.  In a sense, the two challenge each other to take on an enlarged moral perspective. Both Margaret and Mr. Thornton are also changed by having to face serious obstacles. As the story progresses, their growing attraction (first his, then hers) becomes evident.  Mr. Thornton, as played by Armitage, is compelling.  Margaret is beautifully portrayed by Denby-Ashe.  The actors who play Margaret's parents and Mr. Thornton's mother do an excellent job. All in all, this is a very satisfying movie.                 (SPOILER ALERT:  Here's the false scene.  Margaret sees Mr. Thornton beating one of his workers.  In the book, Mr. Thornton never physically attacks or even threatens to attack his employees. I just remembered another false note - in the book, one does not get the sense that Margaret's father's college chum is romantically interested in her. In the movie, there's an implication that he might be so interested.)
B0002KQNJU|3.0|Honestly, this movie isn't very good.  For the time, it was an attempt at thinking outside the box -- which Polanski is known for.  An interesting spin and an interesting plot.  The acting definately left a lot to be desired.  But the jewel in this crown... seeing Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate together on screen.
B000OHZL1W|5.0|I really enjoy this movie, and was very happy to see it released by Universal on HD-DVD. This movie has a lot of big names in it, and they really deliver. It has great suspenseful moments, international intrigue, a believable plot, and a lot of humorous moments that are actually funny! There are plenty of other places to look if you are looking for a synopsis of the movie, including the standard DVD page, so I'll leave it to them to tell you about the movie if you don't already know it.<br /><br />My review here will be about the HD transfer itself. Overall, I was really impressed! It's a definite jump from the standard DVD, even upconverted. I might even go so far as to say that some selected scenes look incredible. Most of the scenes in Sneakers are dialogue, and a lot of people in them, and I noticed that the clarity of people's faces and eyes was great. The shots of the buildings, and the Scrabble tiles being rearranged I thought were great. For the most part though, the PQ is good, but certainly not demo material.<br /><br />There is definitely some grain noticable, but I was happy to find it wasn't distracting. Even in some of the darker scenes where I expected some heavy grain, the grain was only noticable, not obtrusive. The sound is also excellent. I don't know if it is better than the S-DVD, but I had no complaints with the 5.1 soundtrack. Sure I would have loved me some lossless audio, but I didn't expect it and it isn't really a big deal to me that it isn't there.<br /><br />I have only 2 complaints about this disc. First, I wish Universal had cleaned it up a bit better. There were a fair amount of \\"flecks\\" floating through the picture throughout. Of course, once I stopped focusing on the picture and enjoyed my movie, I didn't notice them except for a few brief moments, but they are definitely there. Is it hard to clean the master? I was a bit disappointed in that area, as most films in HD are extremely clean, with flecks only occasionally. These were fairly constant. My second complaint is extremely minor and more personal, but I wish there were some Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this disc, and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoyed the movie. It's a definite improvement from the S-DVD. It's certainly not a movie I'd pop in to show off my TV for friends, but then I never expected that. The only thing that I wish had been done differently would have been for a cleaner transfer, removing some of the larger and more noticable flecks.<br /><br />Bottom line? If you like this movie, this is a must have. It is an excellent step up from the standard DVD.d complaint is extremely minor and more personal, but I wish there were some Spanish subtitles.

B000007638|5.0|I went to the Wings over America concert in May 1976 in Atlanta.  I paid $7.50 for a seat in the back of the stage.......I was lucky to get tickets!!    We just went wild when the light fell on McCartney for the opening song Venus and Mars/Rock Show....and the brass section for Jet was JUST wicked.  Great opening for anyone's concert !!!    During my concert someone walked up to the stage, and threw Jelly beans at McCartney while he was playing \\"Yesterday\\" which hit the strings.......and McCartney said \\"quit it\\"  One of those moments that I will rememmber always.......what an arse that guy was for doing that.    The strongest songs are \\"Let me Roll it\\", \\"Sprits of Ancient Egypt\\", \\"Maybe I'm amazed\\", \\"Medicine Jar\\", \\"Letting Go\\", \\"Hi, Hi, Hi\\".    \\"Soily\\" is one of the best endings for anyone's concert.......he just screamed his lungs out for this rocker.....which is made to last with the echo.       Listening to \\"Live and Let die\\" is fun......but the explosions are not really heard on the recording.  Imagine....I was looking through bincolars at Paul playing piano.....and the whole piano looked like it blew up!!   I was in shock....and so was the audience.  Now it is old hat....we expect those explosions....but back then, it scared us....and you can hear from the crowd thier expressions on the explosions \\"Live and let die\\"........bang!!    The Paul's bass playing on this recording is simply amazing....as it was listening to it live.  The new Wings members at the time Jimmy McCullough blazed his way on the guitar, and Joe English was a powerful drummer.     One of my complaints about this album, is that they never listed the concert site for each of the songs.....I always wondered if my concert that I went to see made it to the record.      Expensive CD......but well worth it to McCartney and Wings fans.
075640407X|5.0|I bought this book tentatively.  I was looking for new authors, but I usually like to start with paperbacks in case I don't like the author's style--a much smaller investment.  But this one was a Wow.  I couldn't put it down, and I've already pre-ordered the second book in the series.      Rothfuss is one of two new authors I've recently discovered who have caught my fancy and kept my attention throughout. I hope he writes many more.
B000002UQJ|4.0|I read two reviews bashing one of the songs that I love off this album.  Biker Like an Icon is one of his best 90's rockers.  For me....this is the best song on the album. Which is about a young girl who is in love with a bad boy....a biker.....probably came about because McCartney was expierencing some not so great characters with his own daughters and their dates that they brought home around that time.      I also like Looking for changes \\"I saw a cat with a machine in his brain, the man that feed him said he 'didn't feel any pain'   Great message song about Animal rights....and great song.       Other great songs on this album are Mistress and Maid, I owe it all to you, Golden Earth Girl, The lovers that never were.     Get out of my way...is an ok rocker.  Wine Dark Open Sea....also has a great smoothing feel to it, with some nice words, and chording.    His other two message songs....Peace in the Neighborhood and Cmon on People fall flat.....  and the title track Off the ground barely makes it off the ground.     But otherwise this is a fairly strong album from Paul.  It probably does rank as one of his most underated albums.
B000021XR5|3.0|On October 26, 1999, Stone Temple Pilots released their forth studio effort appropriately titled \\"No. 4.\\" Though the album fell below the band's true potential, the failure in sales was a direct result of the band's inability to promote the album while singer Scott weiland was in drug rehabilitation. Dispite the many obstacles that the band had to endure, they were able to create a handful of some of their best songs to date such as \\"Down,\\" \\"Heaven & Hot Rods,\\" and \\"Sour Girl.\\"  \\"Sour Girl,\\" which was written about Weiland's failing relationship with his then wife, even became one of the band's most popular singles.  But all in all, the album as a whole is plagued by poor production and numerous songs that could be considered \\"fillers.\\"  Below, please find the rating for each song individually:    Down - 10/10    Heaven & Hot Rods - 10/10    Pruno - 3/10    Church On Tuesday - 7/10    Sour Girl - 10/10    No Way Out - 9/10    Sex & Violence - 4/10    Glide - 7/10    I Got You - 5/10    MC5 - 3/10    Atlanta - 6/10
B000PKG6TE|5.0|After reading through half of the 40 reviews thus far submitted it is apparent that no one knows what the f^ck to expect from QOTSA's 5th goody, Era Vulgaris.  I admit I didn't know, and I purposefully rejected every urge to listen to the songs from this album before its release: radio, online, or from any fello or fella.  I was rewarded with a remarkable rendition by the FiffifTeeners, the Courageous Chris Goss and the Gigantic Josh Homme.  It's like these guys don aluminum foil attire, better to receive the wavestream frequencies from our brains, trek to the highest point possible, and sift [...] the [...] most music is to find what listeners want not only now but for thousands of listens beyond.  Crazy I know, but every song on this album is ripe with the perfect juicy texture.          It is obvious to me and will be to you too, if you appreciate a non-pigeonholeable masterpiece, this album's PRODUCTION is PRISTINE!  The songs are apropos and tight.  Yeees, your singles are here intact and full of the buzz you need to keep your head full of nice thoughts.  For those who adore an album from start to finish THIS is it.  Homme and crew get their hands sweaty on some funky equipment.  This album is a testament to QOTSA's wisdom, diligence, and severe disdain towards the always present beast that is the diahhrea of badly envisioned and badly produced music.  Hail to J-Ho!
B0009HLDFU|3.0|Named after the World War II term \\"foo fighter,\\" a mysterious aerial phenomena, the Foo Fighters have adopted a history of \\"hit or miss\\" albums with their newest release \\"In Your Honor\\" leaning towards the \\"miss\\" category.  The \\"hit or miss\\" routine began with a \\"miss\\" in 1995 with their self-titled debut.  It seems as if every other album afterwards followed the same fate while the albums in between, \\"The Colour And The Shape\\" and \\"One By One,\\" exude flawlessness.  Continuing this method, \\"In Your Honor,\\" contains a few classics but as a whole it leaves something more to be desired. The first four tracks of disc one, \\"In Your Honor,\\" \\"No Way Back,\\" \\"Best Of You,\\" and \\"DOA\\" are the highlights of the album while the remaining six songs show promise at times but they tend to become a bit monotonous as they seem to be drum-driven rather than vocal or guitar-driven.  The 10 songs on the second disc, containing more peaceful, acoustic arrangements, is clearly their worst collection of songs to date as they lack depth vocally and musically.  Below, please find the rating for each song individually:    {Disc 1}    In Your Honor - 8/10    No Way Back - 9/10    Best Of You - 10/10    DOA - 10/10    Hell - 6/10    The Last Song - 6/10    Free Me - 6/10    Resolve - 6/10    The Deepest Blues Are Black - 6/10    End Over End - 7/10    {Disc 2}    Still - 5/10    What If I Do? - 4/10    Miracle - 6/10    Another Round - 3/10    Friend Of A Friend - 2/10    Over And Out - 3/10    On The Mend - 4/10    Virginia Moon (Featuring Norah Jones) - 3/10    Cold Day In The Sun - 2/10    Razon - 2/10
B000F3TBIO|3.0|Mike Patton's a guy with about eight billion musical ideas and influences, and it seems the guy is very hardcore on trying to record every crazy idea he's had.  Peeping Tom sees him going for a modern sounding \\"pop\\" album.  \\"Pop\\" in this case means a kind of club/techno/rappish kind of thing....Patton style of course.  Don't think that means Fantomas meets Chingy or anything.  Sure it gets a bit goofy and odd here and there, but Patton more or less plays it straight here.  Though Patton is going for a mainstream sound on this cd, it never really comes across as though he was trying for mainstream success or that he was trying to chart a top ten single.  Of course in the Patton tradition of doing something odd, making a non-mainstream mainstream album is certainly one of the oddest projects yet.  And Patton seems to have a knack for adapting to different vocal and music styles very naturally and without sounding like a wannabe.  So why only 3 stars?  Well, the fact of the matter is, this just isn't my kind of sound, Patton or not.  I'd be a hypocite if I said I didn't like this kind of music, but it's cool if Mike Patton does it.  I don't and have never cared for this kind of music, but I certainly do respect and admire the effort on Mike's part.  The hardcore fans will buy it, some will love it and others will hate it.  I don't love or hate it, but feel it's well executed even if it isn't my thing.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I am 29 years old and have been a loyal fan of Bon jovi since the age of 11.  I can honestly say that this album is the best they have done in a long time.  The whole \\"Country\\" thing is being blown way out of proportion, it sounds great and it isn't a complete departure from their normal sound.  Jon's voice has always had that kind of sound to it anyway if you think back, so now the rest of the band has just elaborated on that to make a great album that will reach a whole new fan base.          Believe me I am not a fan of country music!  This is not a \\"country\\" album!!  Yes, it has \\"country\\" aspects to it but I hope that doesn't stop people from buying this great new sound.
B000KJU1MS|5.0|In the 70s Kiss was it. It was cool to be into Kiss. In the 80s, it was the exact opposite. By the late 80s and early 90s the makeup was off and Kiss were a (no pun intended) washed up \\"bunch of posers.\\"<br /><br />This DVD dispels the myth that Kiss were ever posers. They indeed were always great musicians and they were the inspiration for many metal bands rocking your world today (rumor has it that while backstage at a 70s Kiss show Eddie Van Halen's signature guitar tapping was inspired while seeing Ace Frehley do it). And Kiss so happen to have put on one of the most theatrical shows in rock and roll history.<br /><br />And that history is captured on this 2-disk DVD, albeit mostly with terrible video quality.<br /><br />Man, did I ever enjoy being able to see the original line-up of Kiss perform on these disks. The thing is that the awesome performances on these disks are mostly footage from 1974 - 1977 live shows, so the quality is early 70s video...and that ain't good. Often times in the live performances there are major reminders that the video is dated: horizontal lines across the picture, complete picture blackouts and just plain old low quality video.<br /><br />On the other hand, the audio on the first two disks is a completely different story. The audio wizards cleaned up the sound on Disks 1 & 2 and they've offered it with a terrific 5.1 Dolby mix.<br /><br />After enjoying what was more of a front row seat experience with the quality HD video and surround sound on the awesome, 5-star Rock the Nation 2004 DVD by Kiss, the live performances in the Kissology set were reduced to mere DVD viewings. However, it was great to reminisce and watch as Gene, Paul, Ace & Peter went through their classics of the era. And the Kissology set that I got included a 3rd bonus disk that to my surprise was a show from Madison Square Garden in February 1977 THAT I WAS AT!

0143034901|3.0|I see from the other reviews that i'm not the only person with this opinion of the book.<br /><br />The writing is amazing. The use of words, their placement and sequence, is fantastic. I was shocked to find that this is a translation, and wish to send my abject admiration to both the author and the translator.<br /><br />But the content? It leaves so much to be desired. It was predictable, the glaring symmetry between the main character and his idol nearly suffocating, and the characters shallow and one-dimensional. From the sadistic police inspector to the misguided teenage boy with a heart of gold to the father who forsakes his son only to forgive him when it's too late, the stereotypes and paper cut-outs trounce through a story full of unnecessary complications and even more unnecessary oversimplifications.<br /><br />Another reviewer wondered how a book full of excess violence and 'pulp fiction sex' made it onto the best seller list. I have two theories, one optimistic and one pessimistic. The optimistic version is that for most, the quality of the writing is sufficient to compensate for the failings of the story. The pessimistic version is that what people want to read, and are willing to pay for, is sex and violence with a sorry semblance of a plot draped over them.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since day one, and have every CD that they have made, Have A Nice Day was Awesome, After hearing Lost Highway I loved the changed in the music and songs. More country-rock  You have got to get this CD it is great, My favorite guys have proved that after all these years they can still rock !!!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|What a sad day for linkin park. I have to admit that these guys were over played badly on the radio and i had to take a break but never did I stop saying that they were great at what they did and did it like no other. I have to say after listening to this cd I nearly cried because it's so disappointing. I thought to myself... and this is Linkin Park sounding washed up.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I ran out and bought this one when it came out and because I loved the old Linkin Park I gave this cd a try ... a few actually. There is nothing at all thats stands out, nothing that catches you like they used to. If you are a fan of the their older albums don't disappoint yourself by buying this one. They sold out and lost that originality that made them so awesome.   Also the political statments run rampant on this cd (seems like a trend lately). I had hoped they wouldn't go that route but alas, they did and badly.  I'd return it if I could.
B000002GQE|5.0|`Cold hearted orb that rules the night... removes the colors from our sight... yet we decide which is right.... and which is an illusion.\\"<br /><br />Such are the spoken words which close this remarkable recording... leaving one almost breathless at the consideration of that thought.<br />There is some music that is simply timeless. Music imbued with a such a quality that sets it outside of the confines of time and space... a specialness that is unique among other works. The Moody Blues landmark recording, `Days of Future Passed' is such a special piece of music. It is both timeless and far ahead of it's time.<br /><br />Technically their second recording release, (following `Go Now' with mostly different band personnel), for all practical purposes, `Days' is their debut album with the addition of the mainstay songwriters Justin Hayward and John Lodge.  This record is astounding in every respect, from it's concept to it's orchestration to the originality, beauty and diversity of it's songs.  The time period of it's release, 1967, was the absolute peak in creativity in the music world. And indeed, this album has no predecessor in terms of sound or style. It's an original new creation, and was executed with exquisite artistic brilliance.<br /><br />This was the record that launched the careers of the Moody Blues, and it was a hard act to follow, probably especially for them. Although they went on to record many more great albums... In Search for the Lost Chord, On the Threshold of a Dream, A Question of Balance, To Our Children's Children's Children, EDBDF, Seventh Sojourn, and on.....  most would agree they never exceeded the beauty put down on this one.<br /><br /> A very young Justin Hayward opens the suite singing `Dawn is a feeling...' and the rest is a trip that takes you along through a day with a variety of moods and emotions. What is amazing is the quality of maturity in his voice, yet he was only 18 when this was recorded. Amazing. The two most recognizable songs on the record, also Justin Hayward tunes, Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin remain the strongest Moody Blues songs in their 40+ year history.<br /><br />The orchestration score complements the songs beautifully with a variety of segway pieces that connect the tunes in such a way as to lead one through a story. The score is credited to a Peter Knight, but research as to who this guy is leads to a dead end. I later read in an offbeat book that Peter Knight was one of many stage names for a man named Chuck Hamil, the brother of actor Mark Hamil who starred in the original Star Wars movie trilogy. It seems Chuck Hamil is/was an amazingly gifted musician who also wrote, sang and recorded many other radio hit records of the late sixties, such as those credited to a Scott McKenzie's `San Francisco' and others (Gary Puckett?)... but he never used his real name. Interesting details!<br /><br />Regardless, the origins of the album seem to be shrouded in mystery. But the quality of the music speaks for itself. I always have felt there was something special about the music of the Moody Blues. This is the album that sparked that interest, which has never died since. Great art stands the test of time, and this certainly does.yward tunes, Tuesday Afternoon and Nights in White Satin remain the strongest Moody Blues songs in their 40+ year history.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|I was truly impressed with this album.   I have grown to like Brad Paisley more and more over the years.   He is obviously talented but this record really showcases his talent more than ever.  There are a great mix of songs. I love some of the bluegrass influenced songs but he truly shines on the song- \\"It did\\" -amazing vocal. I love it.  It would be hard to pick a favorite.  It's a great record!
1594489505|5.0|This book blew me away.  It was about two Afghani women over the course of the last decades.  Although the characters were fictitious, the greater backdrop of Afghanistan and its changing cultural and political powers (e.g., communism; Taliban) were gripping. The way in which Hosseini developed his characters--particularly the two main ones, Mariam and Laila--was flawless. As the reader you truly empathized with their plight. And the bond that formed between them was palpable. Most importantly, Hosseini expressed the ongoing plight of women in Afghanistan with heartbreak, respect, and hope.     I love to read a book and learn something--especially about issues that are so contemporary and impactful. That was definitely the case w/ \\"Suns.\\"

0312360266|2.0|I wrote a review, and yet Amazon somehow ate it, so let's try again.    The novel is okay - it's well written enough. The main character has some interesting ways of describing things. But it's not as good as it could be. Specifically:    - The main character is a Mary Sue. From the beginning, she's special, special, special - she's part Cherokee, she's beautiful, everybody loves her, she's got an awesome facial tattoo that fills itself in by magic, and she doesn't have a single negative trait that would spoil the impression that she's anything but perfect. She's also got a magic cat.      - Her friends are essentially the cast of the first season Real World. There's the Black Girl, the Gay Guy, and even the Okie Girl. They have no traits, but chirp at each other amusingly in order to seem like the world's most wonderful friends.     - There's some religious bigotry in that all of the pagans are absolutely  perfect, handsome, Byron-spouting Goths - more of that wish fulfillment - and all of the people who belong to the Old Religion are a bunch of hypocritical, patriarchal jerks. This is the kind of simpleminded thinking that most writers outgrow around the age of sixteen or so; not so much here.     - The antagonists are simply evil without having any other personality traits. There's some vague mutterings about how the evil girl is \\"set up\\" towards the end, but nothing that makes her more a cartoon.     You could find better pagan fiction, better vampire fiction, better high school fiction - the writing is technically good, but I would say that the series needs to get seriously deep or it'll remain a layer of wish-fulfillment frosting over an empty cake.
B000HDNPM0|5.0|I am writing this review if you land here and you are not on the DVD section. This beloved and memorable film is great. I urge you to read the reviews on the dvd versions. This is a great movie, evidence, remastered and popular. I have photo stills of the movie, purchased from a collector from a studio man. I am going to put them up on the dvd section. So for shots of this great movie, check a dvd version. I'm not sure, if I put the photos here they will come up on the dvd version page.  This is an oldie but goodie, a good plot for sci fi and we all loved it, back in the day. Now go see what the dvd reviews say. OK?
B000002UD0|5.0|How one approaches this disc depends on what you think of when you hear the name \\"John Lennon\\". If your idea of Lennon is the politically naive, misinformed \\"pseudo-Messiah\\" some people try to make him out to be, then listen to MIND GAMES. If your idea of him is the \\"kitty\\"-whipped, emaciated shadow who groaned out vapid tunes like \\"Nobody Told Me\\" and \\"Wheels\\", then you would be happier listening to DOUBLE FANTASY on continuous loop. However, if your idea of John Lennon is that of the former Beatle who got into the music business because he liked the work of Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly and Little Richard, then take a listen: THIS ALBUM KICKS SOME MAJOR BOOTY!<br /><br />  In 1973, Lennon was separated from Yoko Ono and found himself collaborating with music producer, Phil Spector on an album of Rock and Roll covers. When Phil \\"disappeared\\" with the demos, rather than wallow in bitterness, Lennon decided to work with a handful of musicians on another project that would become WALLS AND BRIDGES. John's proven abilities as a song writer are well displayed here but on this occasion, Lennon's under-appreciated skills as a VOCALIST is what made this album a triumph! On this \\"rekkid\\", John Lennon did some of the best singing in his entire career!<br /><br />  Tortured lyrics dominate this album, but instead of lame-o impressions of Bob Dylan, John sang in his own style, the kind to which we have grown accustomed to hearing in some of the best Beatle tunes. John was alienated from his wife, uncomfortable with his celebrity and just plain mad at the world! Still, he never lost his sense of humor so grim songs like \\"Goin' Down on Love\\" and \\"Nobody Loves You\\" are balanced by little ditties such as \\"Old Dirt Road\\" and \\"Whatever Gets You Through the Night\\"-- the latter tune was a duet with Elton John that became a #1 hit! The hypnotic \\"#9 Dream\\" is here, featuring a cameo by Lennon's girlfriend of the time, May Pang, as well as one of the most beautiful love songs ever written, \\"Bless You\\". Listen for 10-year old Julian Lennon on \\"Ya,Ya\\" and shudder as John seems to predict his own death in the nightmarish, \\"Scared\\".<br /><br />  Where does this album stand in the Solo-Lennon canon? As an oddity but a delightful one that anticipates the Punk-Soul sound of groups like Portishead [[ASIN:B00000DLV1 Roseland NYC Live]] or Girls Against Boys [[ASIN:B0000019L8 House of Gvsb]]. Finally, no matter what else one may think about this disc one thing cannot be denied: YOU CAN DANCE TO IT, GOL' DANG, IT! How many other \\"post-Beatles\\" Lennon albums can you say that about?

0393327655|2.0|I believe, based on Sam Haris' own writing on page 67, that he was deeply disturbed and impressed by the 9/11 tragedy, and he realized that religious fanaticism was the motivator, but then he decided that all people of faith are fanatics and had to go, or at least their beliefs had to go.  It's sort of like saying that because someone I loved died of food poisoning, that all food has to be done away with, and that we should all live on water and supplement pills, (several of which have yet to be developed, but research is promising.)<br /><br />Now, what do we do when even here in America, as Harris writes on page 17,  \\"230 million Americans believe that a book...was authored by an omniscient...deity\\" (sorry about all the dots, but there's a word limit to reviews).<br /><br />Well, we insult them, of course!  And a little hysteria doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />On page 12, Harris writes, \\"There seems, however, to be a problem with some of our most cherished beliefs about the world: they are leading us, inexorably, to kill one another.\\"  Wow!  That explains why people of all manner of faiths live together peacefully here in the United States.<br /><br />On page 17, Harris writes, \\"In America, religious moderation is further enforced by the fact that most Christians and Jews do not read the Bible in its entirety and consequently have no idea just how vigorously the God of Abraham wants heresy expunged.\\"<br /><br />Well, I've read the Bible in its entirety and I know that in the Christian church the ultimate punishment is excommunication.  The Law of Moses is not bound on Christians, and Deuteronomy is not the criminal justice code for the Christian church.<br /><br />On page 23, Harris writes the funniest thing in the whole book for me, \\"Imagine that six billion of us wake up tomorrow morning in a state of utter ignorance and confusion.\\"  All our books and gadgets are here, but we don't know how to read or use them.  \\"What knowledge would we want to reclaim first?\\"  Well, personally I'd choose the ethical teachings in the Sermon on the Mount.<br /><br />On page 45, Harris writes, \\"The Bible, it seems certain, was the work of sand-strewn men and women who thought the earth was flat and for whom a wheelbarrow would have been a breathtaking example of emerging technology.\\"<br /><br />First of all, Isaiah 40:22 says, \\"He sits enthroned above the circle of the earth\\" in referring to God.  So, they knew the Earth was a \\"circle\\", or orb.  Or, at least a flat circle like a microwave platter.  How would they know that?<br /><br />The Israelites came to exist among the people who built the Great Pyramids, and the writers of the New Testament wrote as Roman citizens or subjects, so I'm quite sure they saw technology beyond a wheelbarrow.  But does it matter?  That was just Sam Harris insulting a person of faith who might happen to read the book.  He seems to relish doing that, as he does on page 73, \\"Jesus Christ...can now be eaten in the form of a cracker.\\"  Didn't he learn that you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar?  He might at least learn from the story of Adam and Eve that if you want to lead someone away from God, you seduce and tempt them, not insult and attack them.<br /><br />Furthermore, you don't make mind numbingly false accusations against the object of someone's faith, as Harris does on page 97 where he writes, \\"The explicit demonization of the Jews appears in the Gospel of John\\" followed by a quote that only a person totally ignorant of John and the Bible, too lazy to personally verify, and likely already an anti-Christian bigot would possibly believe to be \\"demonization\\" of Jews.<br /><br />So, it is obvious to me that this book really isn't aimed at changing the views of Jews, Christians, or Muslims.  (Since Harris' did such a hatchet job on Christianity I didn't even bother to read the chapter on Islam, since I don't have the knowledge to verify if what I read is true.)  Who is the target audience for this book?  Perhaps people who never think about religion except when it's unavoidably in their face as on 9/11/2001.<br /><br />I actually tried to read this book three times and only succeeded on the third because it reeks of such malevolence toward people of faith.  However, I pressed on and was happily rewarded by chapter six, where Harris goes after moral relativism, pacifism, and even discusses when the use of torture might be acceptable.  So, Harris makes \\"progressives\\" mad too!  Gotta love that!<br /><br />So, after about 200 pages of rancor directed at \\"faith\\", what is Harris' solution for the world's problems (or should I say problem; that awful faith that just keeps getting us to kill each other)?  Mysticism!  And not much to go on there either.  The truth is \\"in there\\" somewhere; in our heads.  And, on page 106 Harris writes, \\"Our common humanity is reason enough to protect our fellow human beings from coming to harm.\\"  (That just makes me think of the \\"Brotherhood of Man\\" song at the end of \\"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\\".)  But has that ever worked before?<br /><br />Finally, I must say that the Notes section at the end of this book impressed me.  I might have learned even more about Sam Harris' logic, or lack thereof, if I had read those notes.  Certainly this book isn't boring, and Harris' does encourage people to discuss matters of faith.  He assumes that these discussions will inexorably lead to faith being proven obsolete, but what if he's wrong about that too?oidably in their face as on 9/11/2001.

B000P5FF46|5.0|The Scorpions' latest release \\"Humanity: Hour I\\" is a collection of thoughtful rock anthems that revolve around the theme that mankind as a whole is losing its' humanity and needs to reclaim it. The Scorpions are not the first band to have a somber, \\"the end is near\\" mood encompass an entire album (see Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Ultimate Sin\\") but they do a good job of putting together some good, nice-to-listen-to, songs while at the same making the listener stop and think for a bit.<br /><br />What's encouraging here from a musical perspective is that the Scorpions have now released a second solid studio album in a row (following \\"Unbreakable\\") and do not appear to look like an aging band whose act is tiring out. On the contrary, it looks like they got a lot more rockin' to do. And for us Scorpions fans, that is, indeed, good news.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|Following on from the stirring, morbid and undoubtedly unique journey of \\"Funeral\\", Arcade Fire dispels any fears (and critic's expectations) of a slacking follow-up. \\"Neon Bible\\" is quite simply one of the best albums I have heard in recent years. Vastly superior to the fields of mediocre pop-rock and even the band's past high standard - this is an album to savour.<br /><br />Successfully different is the theme for \\"Neon Bible\\". Instead of re-hashing a tried and tested formula, the band branch out an array styles and refine their existing idiosyncrasies. New flavours are introduced to spectacular effect - perhaps best shown by the glorious stomping \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\", a song many have been comparing to heyday Springsteen due to Butler's stressed and authoritative delivery of lyrics attacking the state of current affairs. A similar theme is applied to \\"Windowstill\\", a yearning ballad with Butler singing about his desires to move on and away from this troubled society.<br /><br />Further developments in sound include the album's sublime closer \\"My Body Is A Cage\\", which sees the band entering slow-burning blues, fusing it with the eerie backdrop of searing pipe organs. Similarly, other album highlight \\"Intervention\\" showcases the thundering organs as the central piece, with the song slowly picking up pace until it becomes a stomping riot through Butler's potent lyrics concerning the ideals and demands of modern life, \\"you say it's money that we need, as if we're only mouths to feed\\", and religion, \\"working for the church while your family dies\\", and how ultimately love needs to be tendered, \\"every spark of friendship and love will die without a home\\". While these may not be revolutionary lyrics, Butler's compelling style of delivery gives a fantastic sense of desperation, letting his emotions spill out and giving great weight to his words and the music backing it.<br /><br />I believe these changes make \\"Neon Bible\\" such a major success for me, as it shows the band developing and adding new influences to an already exceptional sound. This is not to say \\"Neon Bible\\" is just an outing into new territory as there is still that signature vibe and atmosphere, only refined for better effect. This is shown in one of my favourites \\"Keep The Car Running\\" which seems a direct continuation of sounds from \\"Funeral\\", combining the strong galloping march of \\"Power Out\\" and the lush vocal harmonies of \\"Wake Up\\", only this time the structuring is concise and trimmed, making for a more refined outing. The same refinement can be said for \\"No Cars Go\\", the pinnacle song from Arcade Fire's debut EP, only this time it is executed in riotous style, emphasising the powerful strings and catchy chorus melodies. \\"Ocean of Noise\\" strikes me as a great improvement on the slower and brooding ballad approach, and showcases one of Butler's most menacing and brooding performances to date.<br /><br />Other tracks unmentioned keep the album flowing, and make for an album free of any filler. Songs such as the gloomy opener \\"Black Mirror\\", the subtle atmospheric title track and the two-part \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\" round off \\"Neon Bible\\".<br /><br />\\"Neon Bible\\" lived up to my expectations and delivers one of the most powerful and stirring albums in recent years.

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Its a miracle that the Chili Peppers have come up with such a raw and real masterpiece 20 years into their career.  I have been listening to this album for about a year and still lovin it.
0060723513|4.0|Good easy read. A look into your inner self and how you look at the world.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This Ring Cycle does *not* deserve three-and-a-half stars, so I'm trying to up the average--I'd prefer to give it four-and-a-half, but there we go.    There are minor quibbles which have been mentioned: no horses, the fact that the twins aren't very, well, twin-like--they're all true, but not enough to take a star off, that's for sure. All the problems with it are so minor I hardly noticed.    James Morris' Wotan is truly amazing, and Hildegard Behrens, though not perfect, is a decent enough Brunnhilde. But Siegfried Jerusalem as Siegfried troubled me (I think I've been spoiled by Alberto Remedios--listen to the ENO Ring Cycle recording of \\"Siegfried\\" after this and you'll get my point). Matti Salminen is a wonderful Hagen/Fafner, and the music is of course excellent. The voices range from fair to awe-inspiring. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves opera, or legends, or (like me) both.
B00006I53S|5.0|Just bought this lens for my new XTi and can't imagine being any more pleased. As other reviews all confirm: focus is fast and quiet, slippage isn't an issue (hopefully that will be true over time) and the IS lives up to the marketing for low light shots.    Note that the \\"wide angle\\" end of this zoom isn't very wide, so we bought the standard lens with the XTi, instead of buying the body only, so we would have the 18 mm wide angle for shooting in tight areas.    There are just two small warnings about this lens:  1) It is pretty hefty. To get all this quality you need some substance, so beware that the strap might get a little heavy around your neck by the end of the day. For my wife's small hands the weight is significant, so we'll use the 18-55 that came with the camera for when we don't need the big lens.  2) The focal length adjustment ring is a little tight in some areas, which makes fine adjustments jerky. Hopefully that will loosen up over time.    Overall, a great standard lens.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|\\"5th Gear\\" marks Brad's fifth album (sixth if you count the Christmas album) and he continues the approach that pretty much started with \\"Mud On The Tires\\". The album includes the single \\"Ticks\\", probably the only song written on the subject, that song follows the trend of his older songs \\"Celebrity\\" or \\"Alcohol\\". The newest single \\"Online\\" is something of clunker to me only because it's a very \\"current events\\" kind of song and in time can become dated. Brad's sense of humor comes thru on \\"I'm Still A Guy\\" a song along the lines of \\"I'm Gonna Miss Her\\". The duet with Carrie Underwood, \\"Oh Love\\" is a standout. These two voices sound really great together. The album ends with the instrumental track \\"Throttleneck\\" where Brad tears it up. The Kung Pao Buckaroos return once again as well (with Vince Gill filling in for George Jones) and sing on the track \\"Bigger Fish To Fry\\". You'll also hear Dolly Parton in a brief clip from the \\"Time Well Wasted\\" album. Little Jimmy Dickens' jokes are once again really funny in the outtakes.    A great album and Brad shows why he's the top male in country music today.
B000093FLA|5.0|Guy Ritche slid this one out a few years ago, and I missed it. A good cast including Jason Statham plays Turkish (the transporter, Crank) and Brad Pitt as mickey,the bare knuckle gypsy boxer.  Essentially an Action Comedy.  Turkish, a unlicenced boxing promoter, narrates the story as it revolves around and 84 carrot Diamond, and what eventually turns out to be a stuggle to try and save his own hide from Brick top, the underground promoter that \\"tells you what will happen\\". Its intriguing how thing and paths finally entertwine.  Must see. If you like Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, this one I believe is better. And if You like Jason Statham, this movie is good as well. A good movie for any collection.
1594200823|5.0|Pollan leads you down the path of food knowledge making you feel like he's sitting at the table with you.  I have been in the food industry all my life, reading this book reminded me why.  Most of his topics roll out like a great joke being told.  Pollan's journey to decipher what is important about how we get and what we eat never loses momentum.  He has an ability to cover large subjects quickly and succinctly.  There is definite passion in his investigations and each meal he dissects offers new perceptions about how the food we eat gets to our table.  I thought the book was a fun read.  There is so much world history intertwined with telling of Pollan's story.  I would reccommend this book to anyone who is a lover of nature, food and animals.  Pollan explored every subject from both sides and never preached about one or the other, the entire time leaving me to decide what to think.  By the end of the book I was telling everyone around me random facts about CAFOs (confined animal feeding operation) and what's happening to the soil in Iowa.  This book helped me make a conscious choice about my school of thought when it comes to, what's for dinner?, what will your choice be?
B00005JNEI|4.0|Worth watching, and full of good facts.  I admit I prefer my documentaries a little less \\"sensational\\" just put the facts out there and let people judge.  But that's just me other people find that boring...
B000OYC3J8|4.0|1. Icky Thump - 5 stars - Excellent song. Nice guitar melody and impressive virtuoso runs. A dungeon like-drum beat perfectly compliments the guitar. Jack's screaming voice at it's best.    2. You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told) - 4 stars - Has a blues-rock feeling to it, very catchy - Jack sings in a normal clear voice. Great medium loud instrumentals.    3. 300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues - 3 stars - Mellow, softer, slow - moments of loud instrumentation. Blues influence, but not sure about this one.    4. Conquest - 4 stars - Trumpet included! Dark and heavy guitar melody. Excellent use of percussion, as well as and interesting dueling between the trumpet and guitar.    5. Bone Broke - 3.5 stars - The song stars out quick and catchy, and then Jack screech's away. Gets rather loud and noisy at moments, but a good jam!    6. Prickly Thorn but Sweetly Worn - 4 stars - I'm not a big fan of the chorus, but overall a very interesting song - as folky as it gets. Extensive use of bagpipe makes this song very unique and addicting.    7. St. Andrew (This Battle Is In the Air) - I look at this as an interlude, with the bagpipe still being present.    8. Little Cream Soda - 5 stars - And from this point on, the album really gathers steam. This song is an impressive garage rock song with quick and heavy guitar riffs followed by an easier setup for Jack's spoken delivery. There is one part in the guitar melody that reminds me of the old \\"Baracuda\\" song. Excellent song, excellent lyrics. My favorite.    9. Rag & Bone - 4.5 stars - Another garage rock song with Jack and Meg at vocals. Just a good ol' rock'n song.    10. I'm Slowly Turning Into You - 4 stars - A heavy and dark guitar melody, with downward spiraling lyrics.    11. A Martyr For My Love For You - 3.5 stars - A mellow ballad about a teenage love affair.     12. Catch Hell Blues - 5 stars - Just as you would assume from the title, there is a definite Blues influence on this song. Mostly instrumentals; the song feels a bit spontaneous at times. Awesome melody. At times there is a very impressive screechy guitar virtuoso riff - unbelievable.    13. Effect & Cause - 4.5 stars - An excellent way to end the album. Feels a bit country influenced ... Jack's southern drawl really shows and adds to this song.
1572704497|5.0|\\"And Then There Were None\\" is one of the best audio books I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. Hugh Fraser gives what can only be described as a masterful performance. His reading is sumptuous, scary, and above all, intelligent. The story moves briskly and chillingly toward the shocking conclusion. Even if you have already read the book (as I have), Fraser's telling must be heard to be believed. This is the rare audio book that you cannot turn off. I highly recommend!!
B000N6TX1I|5.0|First of all, I am a big fan of the genre, since dystopian science fiction is more a comment on our society than an actual projection of what the writer thinks will actually happen.  This means, I've sat through a lot of fourth-rate productions and had a good time watching people ekeing out a life in post-nuclear holocaust, post-population explosion, and post apes-taking-over-the-world societies.<br /><br />What I have NOT enjoyed were the big budget dystopian messes like \\"The Postman\\" and \\"Waterworld\\".  Neither of these had the biting sarcasm of, say, \\"A Boy and His Dog\\", and tried to cover up the hackneyed ideas with dazzling special effects and scenery.<br /><br />\\"Children of Men\\" has both a dark, acerbic soul, and gold standard production values.  This movie employs a very plausible impetus for the plot.  Women haven't been getting pregnant for nearly one generation, and no one's got a clue how to reverse it.  Zoologists are battling the same problem with cheetahs right now, so the premise is not far fetched.  Fifty to seventy years from the epoch of the film, the world will have to get along without humans, as it had to get along without dinosaurs some 50 million years earlier.  (There is a nice, subtle little illustration at one location which demonstrates that.)<br /><br />Dystopian stories don't work unless there's a nearly impossible-but utterly compelling sign of hope.  Winston Smith WILL find true love and save his colleagues from Big Brother before it's too late.  Det. Robert Thorn will be able to stop corporate America from feeding people their deceased loved ones in the form of little green crackers.  And so, it is no spoiler to say that \\"Children of Men\\" has a gal with a bun in the oven: the commodity that makes all other commodities possible.  I mean, without this, there won't be anyone around to battle chagrined androids, or drive a truck full of gasoline across the Australian outback in the 23rd Century.<br /><br />I can't think of a stronger plot motivation in any story.<br /><br />The backdrop of \\"Children of Men\\" is layered with commentary on immigration policies, celebrity worship,  religion, and the self-destructive nature of our species.  Particularly striking to me is, even as human life is becoming a scarce resource, people in this film from every political stripe are still willing to kill their fellows  by the truckload to further their particular causes.  And they ALWAYS have a great justification for it.  (I don't think I've ever wanted to punch out so many movie extras in my entire life.)<br /><br />The climax of \\"Children of Men\\" is very powerful.  It makes the whole movie, even if the denouement ain't the greatest.<br /><br />The actors were superb.  They created such believable characters who were hanging on to the tiniest shred of hope, and defiantly confronting the end of humankind with a sense of duty and a sense of humor.  This was clearly a project the actors believed in, seeing as how two of the biggest stars don't make it halfway through the story.<br /><br />Lastly, I applaud the use of a single, hand-held camera and very long shots.  It gave the audience the feeling of being part of the team trying to save the pregnant girl, instead of viewers of some CGI masterpiece, where there was neither wobble nor splatter on the lens to distract us from Spiderman's antics.<br /><br />The extra features in this movie are good...I guess.  I don't particularly like to hear commentary, because there's a chance it could be way out of line with how I saw the themes.  There are some good anecdotes about having to solve logistical problems, but I couldn't say whether there should be more or less of that sort of thing.<br /><br />This is definitely a movie you should buy, so you can watch it again, and lend it to your cynical friends.The backdrop of \\"Children of Men\\" is layered with commentary on immigration policies, celebrity worship,  religion, and the self-destructive nature of our species.

6305910324|5.0|As one reviewer who happened to winess much of this first hand has pointed out, yeah, hollywood may have taken some liberties with the characters for theatrics, but hopefully overall the message is transmitted, Winning is not everything, and more training and isolation on one task does not alway make a better player.  Other factors come into play, heart and feeling should also.  Based on a true story, Josh, a seven year old, picks up chess from the park (washington square) near his home, on his own.  To the suprise of his parents, one day he asks to play at the park, and does well for the first time. From their, his father becomes involved, who is at first amazed at his son being so good, but then turns into an the classic Overbearing pressuring parent pushing josh into \\"always winning\\". Along the way young josh stuggles with what to do, fearing dissapointing his dad, as well as feeling forced to change his approch to something that brings him no joy.  Alas, can Josh ever find his way, what will his dad do if he looses, and will he really be the next bobby fisher?  Great movie, decent for the family and discussion.
0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah's new memoir, \\"A Long Way Gone,\\" is not only one of the most important books of the year, it deserves to be read in classrooms and reading groups for decades to come.    The United Nations estimates that over a quarter million child soldiers are caught fighting in the fifty violent conflicts that currently rage across our planet.  Subtitled \\"Memoirs of a Boy Soldier\\" Beah's story is the first hand account of a child warrior caught in the civil war of Sierra Leone.  While other journalists have tried to report on the life of child soldiers, Beah has provided a personal look that is both bluntly horrific and stunningly eloquent.    Now 26 years old and living in New York City, Beah was forced to flee his home at age 12, when rebels attacked his village.  After wandering for months through his war-ravaged homeland, Beah was caught by soldiers and conscripted into the army.  He spent his early teen years wielding an AK-47, quickly trained into both a drug addict and professional killer.  While the atrocities of war are startling, Beah's portrayal of his struggle towards rehabilitation and hope is equally gripping.     \\"If you are alive, there is hope for a better day and something good to happen.  If there is nothing good left in the destiny of a person, he or she will die.\\"  Beah took comfort from these words of his murdered father, as he clung to survival after his entire family died.  A book of great dignity and beauty, \\"A Long Way Gone,\\" is both tragic and inspiring.  Beah writes with the directness and clarity that only an insider to such horrors could have.  How a victim of such psychological and physical horror could write a book with this kind of literary sophistication is made even more remarkable considering that English is neither Beah's first, nor second language.
068987474X|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it really gave me a lot of clarity into some relationships of mine that failed for which I didn't understand why. People may think the \\"he's just not that into you\\" is too simple of an explanation for all of those bad boyfriend behaviors, but really just read the book and I think it will give you an overall better sense of the male brain and also what to really read into the way he treats you. I have already recommended this book to all of my girlfriends. And then of course, even if you hate it, it didn't waste too much of your time because its not very long and a very quick, easy read.

If you appreciate the World of Arts and Music you will not be disappointed with Andrew Lloyd Webber's Score!!    Emmy Rossum(Christine)Stole the Show with her Acting and Heavenly Singing Performance!!  Gerard Butler(The Phantom) was the Handsome Phantom with a Good Voice that was Physically Fit allowing his character to be very active in the Movie Opera Play. Gerard's incredible performance of \\"Music of the Night\\" was Outstanding and better than Michael Crawford's Voice Bass Notes!!  Patrick Wilson(Raoul)Singing was Good and his Character played the Alleged BoyFriend that was to Rescue Christine from the Evil Phanton!! Supporting Actress Minnie Driver and Miranda Richardson had limited but Solid Roles!!!

B000AOJ9X0|3.0|I love the Blues and Buddy Guy, but not every song on here is a gem or even the blues.    My favorite song on here is the Tracy Chapman \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" song, but it isn't exactly the blues.    The blues numbers I like are \\"Cheaper to Keep Her\\" and \\"Cut You Loose\\", but even those are not his best.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />When the Rock & Roll Time Capsule is unearthed, somewhere after the time man has finally succeeded in destroying the planet proudly displayed will be Jefferson Airplane's \\"Surrealistic Pillow.\\"  Yes, Jerry Garcia will receive full credit for musical advisement, playing, and creative direction.<br /><br />It seems a bit bizarre and without rational that the same people that grew up listening to eight track tapes, cassettes, and non-virgin vinyl recordings (Only Japan had used the technology of virgin vinyl in pressings LP's) woke up one day and have criticized the fidelity of every album being produced.  A review should be about the contents of the songs.  There is nothing wrong with the sound here and the addition of the bonus tracks are even further incentive for ownership.<br /><br />The second flight of the Jefferson Airplane showed two changes in personnel.  Signe Anderson the female vocalist on the first record had left to start a family and Grace Slick from the Great Society was the finest replacement possible.  Drummer Spencer Dryden (Never got the credit he deserved for his tasty rhythmic patterns) was now part of the band (Skip Spence's next stop was \\"Moby Grape).<br />The album opens with one of the finest tunes the Airplane would construct.  \\"She Has Funny Cars\\" with the perfect riff and strong vocals gets the listeners attention from the opening notes.<br /><br />\\"Somebody To Love\\" one of two songs Grace brought with her from the \\"Great Society\\" is tremendous with the Airplane treatment.  Make no mistake about it the \\"Great Society\\" performed a fine version.  The J.A. fine-tuned things a bit and this version has been a stable of rock and roll Airplane for over 40 years.  A great side note that Marty Balin told me for my Jefferson Airplane book.  Grace also suggested a tune that the \\"Great Society\\" performed live \\"Sally Go Round The Roses.\\"  Their interpretation of the song is as good as any ever from a stage or studio.  The Airplane would tell her two out of three isn't bad.  Her next gem would be later on.<br /><br />\\"My Best Friend\\" is light and on the poppy side.  Some enjoy its place here and others feel it is not one of the stronger inclusions.  I have to agree with the later.  A good tune but when you are compared to Olympian efforts it can be overlooked.<br /><br />\\"Today\\" is one of the finest songs ever penned.  Marty Balin's vocal quality and pure emotion made time stop.  All ears were glued to the speakers the first time the lyrics were heard.  It is nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />\\"Comin Back To Me\\" is another example of Marty's captivating sound.  Give him a ballad, rocker, or rhythm and blues standard and he can excel.<br /><br />\\"3/5 Of A Mile In 10 Seconds\\" is another rocker.  If the following doesn't grab you by the neck nothing will \\"Do away with people.\\"  Jorma's guitar in conjunction with the lyrical content is superb.<br /><br />\\"D.C.B.A. 25\\" is poetry in motion.  Paul Kantner's choice of words is able to balance the fine line of incredible articulation but not over the head of the listener.  He can phrase sentences repeatedly with such command of the language that our attention doesn't divert for a micro-second.  Sadly this wonderful tune never made it to the J.A. stage.<br /><br />\\"How Do You Feel\\" There are multi layers of superlative presentation.  The words, the vocal delivery, and Grace's incredible nuances.  Listen to the tune twice in a row.  The first time will knock you off the chair for its beauty.  The second you'll feel her amazing accompaniment with the perfect phrasing.<br /><br />\\"Embryonic Journey\\" One of the best instrumentals ever devised.  Jorma's fingers display magic.  This would be the first tune he would pen entirely by himself.  It seems unfathomable that the resultscould be this earth shaking.  To this day it is requested at every Hot Tuna and solo gig he is a part of.<br /><br />\\"White Rabbit\\" was the other tune the \\"Great Society\\" performed.  People often debate is it better than \\"Somebody To Love\\"?  Why not call it a tie.<br /><br />\\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\" ends the musical odyssey as it began, with an upbeat rocker and captivating sounds.  If Marty Balin didn't take the vocal helm it wouldn't seem right.<br /><br />This pressing has bonus tracks (Only one rare) but it gives even greater perspective to the musical output of the band.  Two in particular to check out if you aren't an avid fan and not aware of Jorma's perfect vocal inflections when he is singing the blues or folk, are \\"In The Morning (His original) and \\"Come Back Baby\\" (Lightnin' Hopkins).  I mentioned there is one rarity.  A hidden track contains an instrumental \\"D.C.B.A. 25.\\"<br /><br />As the legendary rock and roll photographer, Don Aters often says, \\"It is what it is.\\"  That is one of the finest ever.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"g he is a part of.    \\"White Rabbit\\" was the other tune the \\"Great Society\\" performed.

B000P2A24W|4.0|I must admit, I was scared at initial reports about this album. Rumor Had it that it was heavily Nashville influenced and Country sounding.  Yeah, maybe some, but not to damaging.  Yeah, it may have a bit more acoustic guitar mixed in, A bit of a fiddle in the background, but there is plenty of electric and overall more rock than country, and Definitely Bon Jovi. Great song writing, and nobody can pen a love song or Ballad like John Bon Jovi and his friend. My Favorite in recent albums was Crush, and Bouce was a bit down, Have a Nice day did fair, but I agree, this Album is really good.  My biggest fear was it would be an album like \\"this left feels right\\", and I did not care for it. But relax fans, the Jersey boys are back, great evolution of sound on this album. Definite must buy, great direction for the group, but I'm sure more rock is still to come.
0802130208|5.0|This is probably my favorite book. I think once I got into the crux of it, I laughed out loud on almost every page. Toole takes every opportunity to depict Ignatius as an unbearable oaf, and it is hilarious. I would recommend this to fans of \\"The Office (the UK one at least, maybe the American); Ignatius is more absurd and intolerable than David Brent! Expect a verbose read, but it is easy to fall in love with this story.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|So he's back in the swing with this new album (not that he ever lost his groove, haha) and it is another good one. His humor is unmatched and then of course he always throws in some great songs for romance. You can't beat Brad Paisley when it comes to country music in my book!! Buy this album!!
B000OVLBF8|2.0|This movie is an insult to the extraordinary acting abilities of Nicolas Cage.  The one forgiving point of the movie was that Eva Mendez was cast, but, not for her exceptional acting abilities either, but for her outstanding Feminine form; her body, not her brains.  Why take to Thoroughbreds and make run the \\"Mule Racetrack?\\"  Why take two incredible actors and put them in a movie where their true artistic abilities are not utilized...?  This movie is a waste of time, and that's coming from a person who used to be a really big \\"Ghost Rider\\" fan as a kid.  There is a plus to buying this disaster, his movie is excellent as an insomnia remedy...!
B00000JA9Z|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />Chapter two of the Warhorse saga \\"Red Sea\\" is equal to its predecessor the self-titled debut.  Deep Purple's first bass-player Nick Simper is back with more rock and organ based roll.  If you own one you'll want to complete the set.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the great sounds of the first two Deep Purple records and or Atomic Rooster this band will look good in the CD collection!<br /><br />\\"Back In Time\\" and \\"Confident But Wrong\\" cut through the speakers with no apologies.  \\"I (Who Have Nothing)\\" is a great cover of an old rhythm and blues tune.  Warhorse slows things down a notch but still engraves their initials all over.<br /><br />Once again there are the must have bonus tracks.  Five of the six were going to make up a third album that unfortunately wasn't to be.  One of those tunes you don't want to overlook. \\"Bad Time\\" is good enough to have been included on either release.  The other ones from the vaults are not throw away songs.  The previously released track (On the first LP) is a live version of \\"Ritual.\\"<br /><br />The fidelity is fine and the mix of the instruments is pleasing.  It's never a bad time for Warhorse!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
0316010669|4.0|\\"I didn't like his face.\\"    It's an apocraphal story of Abraham Lincoln and a favorite for preachers everywhere. As a young lawyer, Lincoln allegedly once rejected a prospective employee on the grounds that he didn't like the man's face. When his fellow lawyers incredulously pressed him to explain, Lincoln responded that every man older than 40 deserves their face.    In his latest offering, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Malcolm Gladwell examines the snap judgements we make every day and our own inability to understand what prompts us to make them. From the experts who had a vague intuition that an artwork was a fake--an intuition that was later confirmed--to the rest of us, who will choose one product over another because of the packaging and context in which we see it, subconscious judgements affect every aspect of our existence, including race.    Much of Gladwell's work does focus on the fact that these snap judgements can be trained, which often separates the expert from the rest of us. When music industries heard Kenna sing, they knew he was special. The rest of us, though, are still catching on. Yet there is one qualification to this: in one study regarding our responses to jam, college students and experts ranked six jams nearly the same. However, when a different set of college students was asked to describe their reasons for their preferences, the similarities went away. \\"By making people think about jam,\\" Gladwell writes, \\"[the study] turned them into jam idiots.\\" Sometimes, our unreflective judgements are the most reliable.    To draw a parallel, it seems Gladwell demonstrates what deconstructionists have contended with respect to literature: that the unconscious perceptions of authors shape their texts and meanings. Rather than descend into the world of suspicion, however, Gladwell repeatedly exhorts the reader to have charity toward the subjects of his examples.    Like The Tipping Point, Blink could have been 75 pages shorter. But Gladwell's style is engaging and readable, which makes the repetition somewhat more bearable. Regardless, Gladwell has produced a provocative analysis of a difficult and intriguing aspect of the human experience.
0316067598|5.0|I remember when this incident happened back in 05 and I had no idea of the amazing story of this Texan, and his involvement in the great crusade of our time. As an Australian, it did not get much newstime over here. Thank you PO Luttrell for your service in the GWOT, and God Bless Australia and the USA, the two greatest nations on Earth, and Texas and Queensland, the two best states to come from.
B00005MP58|5.0|Excellent adaption - superb acting.  I keep watching it over & over (and, yes, I need to get a life!).  The earlier BBC version is also excellent & exquisitely acted.  I have both.  Pride & Prejudice has always been one of my favorite books.  This series does it justice.
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|an above average movie with a rather creative story but and decent acting, the dialouge is nothing to marvel at but it isn't unbearable, it seems have a decent lesson to be learned and accuratley depicts in my opinion what would really happen in a time of desperation some would go crazy some would turn to there lovers some would admit secrets never told before and some would reflect. I didn't love the ending, could easily have been refined. overall : 4 stars
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  VERY original, and entertaining.  I got a subscription to showtime just for this series, cancelled it when the season was over.
B00004XMV6|5.0|This is not your average soft porn - this movie is about a BDSM relationship.  If you don't know what that stands for, this may not be the movie for you.  If you do, this is one of the best you'll ever see.  The seduction and the energy between these two is incredible.  Kim Basinger's striptease, performed to Joe Cocker's \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On,\\" is absolutely classic.  They even managed to make the midnight snack scene hot, even though I kept thinking, \\"Who's going to clean that up?\\"<br /><br />This film has a well-deserved cult status in the genre.  If you're able to appreciate the beauty of this type of relationship, the only real disappointment is the way the movie ends.<br /><br />If you love the story, I would also recommend the book this was based on, [[ASIN:0060746394 Nine and a Half Weeks: A Memoir of a Love Affair]].  However, if you find the ending of this movie depressing, you definitely don't want to see the sequel, [[ASIN:1573623857 Another 9 1/2 Weeks]], unless you just can't get enough of Mickey Rourke scowling.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|I have to admit, I would never have bought a Muse CD previous to this album. I had heard of them before, but they weren't really my cup of tea, so to speak!    This all changed when I first heard Supermassive Blackhole on the radio. I was pleasantly surprised to be informed it was Muse. Starlight only reinforced my changing opinion of them.     I purchased the CD and I initially found it a little inaccessible besides the first two singles. After a few listens these preconceptions faded away. I am always attracted to bands that progress. Changing the 'sound', experimenting with new instruments and styles are always preferable to those lesser bands that stupidly resist any form of progression. I hate Razorlight! (arrogant aswell!)    Muse have done themselves a great favour in this album as I am convinced they have garnered themselves with new fans that wouldn't otherwise have considered listening to them. As to the idiots who cry 'sell-out', I simply don't understand that, if they have introduced Dance and Electronica, aswell as 'pop' elements to their sound, so what? Are you suggesting that these are inferior genres to 'rock' - most people acknowledge this is not the case... Those people who aren't able to adapt there listening styles and reject any form of development are just reactionary philistines. Go away.
0618680004|5.0|Following the accolades that greeted the publication of Dawkins' passionate and lucid anti-faith polemic last year some kind of backlash was inevitable. Regrettably it has sometimes taken the form of personal slurs and misrepresentation, some of it so blatant as to suggest that those responsible have not bothered to read `The God Delusion' or paid much attention to what its author has said in numerous media appearances. He has been accused of pro-Nazi leanings on the subject of eugenics, a charge every bit as ludicrous as it sounds, while the Dean of Southwark has trumpeted that Dawkins and his fellow atheists are `just as fundamentalist as the people setting off bombs on the tube, the hardline settlers on the West Bank and the anti-gay bigots of the Church of England'. This is hardly comparing like with like, considering that all the distinguished Professor has done to deserve being lumped together with terrorists and other charmless characters is write a book advocating objective and rational thinking on a subject which has bedevilled and perplexed the human imagination since time immemorial. Even in academic circles the hostility is, at times, bizarre. Terry Eagleton's long dissenting review in the `London Review of Books', often referred to by Dawkins' detractors, is marred by bursts of pretentious language which mystify initially then, under close scrutiny, are seen to be the kind of theological candy-floss that tends to get spun out when logical argument fails. Anyhow his Catholic background needs to be taken into account, something which applies also to the `Spectator's Paul Johnson whose anti-Darwinian, mediaeval mindset obtrudes frequently. His emotive hijacking of the word `fundamentalist' to refer to those who fervently champion evolution rather than intelligent design has been soundly refuted by Dawkins himself, so there is no need to repeat the argument here.<br /><br />Dawkins has also been called `intellectually lazy' by a certain Guardian columnist, and yet `The God Delusion' is a powerful and sustained attack on intellectual laziness that makes short work of some of its practitioners. Charlatans like creationist `professor' Michael Behe and Oxford theologian Peter Swinburne - who thinks that the Holocaust was a character-building exercise dreamed up by God on behalf of the Jews - are obvious easy targets. It has been objected that Dawkins focuses too much on the lunatic fringe, but where a body of doctrine full of absurdities underpins the thinking both of extremists and the more civilized mainstream it is reasonable to ask what purpose those absurdities ultimately serve. Bertrand Russell's parable of the celestial teapot is included, the point being that were the existence of such an object affirmed in holy writ it would be believed by a great many people. Along with this belief in the incredible are lapses in the reasoning faculty to be noted even in some eminent thinkers. For example, there is a discussion of Thomas Aquinas' `proofs' of God's existence, which are nothing of the kind, and a rebuttal of Blaise Pascal's transparently illogical `wager'.<br /><br />A more contemporary example of the sort of woolly thinking under attack is the theory of `non-overlapping magisteria' (NOMA). According to it the scientific domain, or `magisterium', covers the realm of the empirical while religion is subjective, non-empirical, concerned with morality and ultimate meaning. However, whereas science is hard work requiring rigorous discipline and application by experts in their different areas of specialisation it is hard to see what exactly there is in the field of religion to be an expert in. Besides, the `Great Prayer Experiment' for sick patients, funded by the religiously inclined Templeton Foundation, clearly contradicts the NOMA science/religion dichotomy.<br /><br />In his preface Dawkins states boldly that the intention of his book is to `raise consciousness' and in doing so he is following the trail blazed in 1859 by the great consciousness-raiser himself, Charles Darwin. Attacks from the Christian fundamentalist camp on evolution reveal, as we might expect, a chronic and wilful ignorance of anything Darwin wrote. Evolution has nothing to do with mere chance, as is commonly supposed, and the notion of `irreducible complexity' is likewise misconceived. This holds that a complex organ like the eye must have been created in its finished state as part of the Divine Plan, rather than by gradual evolutionary stages, because an incompletely developed eye could have been of no use. There is also the matter of apparent discontinuity in the fossil record, the famous `gaps' which God is said to fill by default. This spurious line of argument is condemned by the theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer and supported by, among others, the intellectually tenth-rate Ann Coulter. In Chapter 5, `The Roots of Religion', Dawkins brings his Darwinian perspective to bear on the subject of religious evolution, expounding his theory of `memes' - units of cultural inheritance which possibly replicate like genes through their appeal to human psychology. This is perhaps especially controversial, but he admits that he is tentatively putting forward the theory to ask if it could work when applied to religion.<br /><br />In his consideration of the `Good' Book Dawkins makes it clear that wherever we get our morals from it is certainly not from the Bible. If we did we would still be executing disobedient children, adulterers and people who committed the enormity of gathering firewood on the Sabbath. Examples are given of material plainly unsuitable for church service readings. In the Sodom and Gomorrah myth the righteous, God-favoured Lot offers up both his daughters to the men of Sodom who have unwholesome designs upon two male angels, then in a drunken, incestuous encounter with his daughters he impregnates both of them. Another variation on the same savoury theme is to be found at Judges:19 which teaches that gang rape and the subsequent slaughter and dismemberment of the victim constitute a lesser evil than homosexual activity. As for the New Testament, the doctrine of Christ's atonement, arguably the grossest con-trick ever inflicted on humankind (ref. Nietzsche's `Anti-Christ'), is dismissed as `vicious, sadomasochistic and repellent'. Even the `love thy neighbour' injunction was an example of in-group favouring which simply meant `love thy fellow Jew', and the notion of a common humanity came about through a shift in the Zeitgeist, or spirit of the times, having nothing to do with religion. Dawkins' attack on scripture brooks comparison with Thomas Paine's `The Age Of Reason' (1794), an earlier example of the scientific mind's indignant reaction against dogma and credulity. Obviously the author of `The God Delusion' will have none of Paine's deism but both men, writing for the non-specialist, share the same sense of outrage at the injustice and savagery perpetrated in the name of an imagined Higher Power, and adopt a similar wittily irreverent tone. It has been said, but bears repeating, that Dawkins writes with humour and compassion which makes Paul Johnson's labelling of him as the `Ayatollah of Atheism' really rather silly.<br /><br />There is comparatively little in the book about Islam, but what is said indicates that the same strictures apply and the list of organisations appended `for individuals needing support in escaping from religion' includes four for disaffected Muslims. Viewers of the BBC series `The Retreat' early this year, in which an idyllic Andalusian setting was the temporary home to a group of young potential converts to Islam, may recall a scene in which one resident imam addressed the seated gathering. The essence of his `teaching' was that the God they must worship decrees the time, place and circumstances of the death of each and every one of His subjects. In other words Allah (`the Compassionate, the Merciful') has been behind every singleatrocity throughout history and the 9/11 hijackers were not deluded after all when they believed that they were carrying out His will. A later episode included the sickening spectacle of a goat being slaughtered, thus locating a blind spot in the psychology of religion whereby a senseless and barbaric act is mitigated, sublimated, by the selfish quest for spirituality of those involved. Recalling to mind some of the justifications made by those responsible for recent outrages it seemed a typical, albeit milder, manifestation of the capacity for wanton cruelty that lurks beneath a civilized veneer. It's just a thought, but if a group of like-minded people were to be filmed taking part in a `consciousness raising' marathon organised and hosted by, say, the British Humanist Association it would probably make for more uplifting viewing than `The Retreat' and, moreover, have a much bigger bearing on life's major issues than `Big Brother' or any of its bastard spawn.<br /><br />In his penultimate chapter Dawkins comes on to the matter of religious education and concludes that, unless it has simply to do with academic consideration of the influence on literature and our general cultural heritage, it has no place. Children brought up in religiously devout families are taught that faith is a virtue. On the contrary, Dawkins argues, it is an evil because it requires no justification and is impervious to rational argument or discussion. Children's author Philip Pullman is quoted on the dust-cover as saying that this book `should have a place in every school library - especially in the library of every \\"faith\\" school'. Indeed it should, along with Pullman's own excellent, iconoclastic `Dark Materials' trilogy. As a reflection of the current changed situation Ofsted, Britain's school standards watchdog, has just said that pupils should no longer be taught to think of religion uncritically as a force for good. The implied reference is to a limited mentality which is the cause of too much trouble in the world to be ignored, and hence the absolute need for books like `The God Delusion'. Anything that works towards the undoing of that mentality surely deserves the highest praise.which teaches that gang rape and the subsequent slaughter and dismemberment of the victim constitute a lesser evil than homosexual activity.

B000006045|5.0|There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic \\"Mezzanine\\" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.<br /><br />What I love about \\"Mezzanine\\" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as \\"Mezzanine\\" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs \\"Angel\\" and \\"Risingon\\" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to \\"Teardrop\\" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. \\"Mezzanine\\" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.
B000002VCB|1.0|Easily the worst album Alan Parsons Project ever released.  Lots of synths and drum machines make this album dull and lifeless.  The best thing about it is the cover art.  The album's concept is how women have caused the downfall of mankind (based on the Garden of Eden parable).  If you look closely, you'll see huge warts and lesions on the women's faces.  The music inside the jacket is totally disposable.  A HUGE disappointment after three great APP releases.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a series. Fascinating characters, plot, script, acting. What more to ask? It keeps amazing me every time I watch it. In spite of being advertised as a science fiction, I, for some reason, tend to think it as a drama with a science fiction angle. I like everybody esp. Captain Mal. He is simply superb and steals the show. Extremely unpredictable, demanding yet caring, decisive as a captain should obviously be. I'd postponed watching it for quite a long time even though my friends kept on bugging me to death to watch it. And when I watched it for the first time, I regretted postponing such a fantastic series. Watch it as soon as you can and you won't regret it.
B00003CX5P|3.0|yeah its was ok but definetly for the younger kids. i guess it goes along with the theme of Aniken Skywalker is also a kid. the next 2 are much better. there's just too much comic relief in this one for an adult.
B000002AH7|5.0|Miles Davis working with arranger and composer Gil Evans put together an album that ranked 356 on Rolling Stones Top 500 albums of all time. It is probaly one of his most accessible albums and the tight compositions take you to the Spanish bullfight and quiet burning passion of a long, hot Spanish summer day. Not the the hardblowing, improvisational jazz that everyone associates with Miles but the arrangements and tight composition makes for a very relaxing, enjoyable listen.
B000O75F7C|4.0|If you're a fan of Porcupine Tree, you probably already have this.  If you're wondering about PT, and you like prog music, you'll probably like this too.  Not immediately accessible, but it will grow on you.
0743496728|5.0|With the resent events this past spring this book is very appropriate.  It is a testiment to how great Picoult is as an author.  She captivates the reader, and toys with your emotions.  You lean towards symphatizing with the \\"bad\\" guy and hating the \\"good\\" guy.    As she writes everyone remembers what it is like to be teased.  This strikes a chord with the reader and how they wanted to alliviate this pain.  They may not have taken the actions as the main character, Peter, but you can sympathize with him.      My only complaint is that Picoult ended the book with a large twist that was not really hard to predict.  She has done it in all the other books I have read.  They add to the dramatic jaw dropping court room scene.  I wasnt suprised by the twist simply because I expected it.    I could not put this book down.  I highly recomend it!
B000C20VPA|4.0|If Scorcese hadn't already done 'Goodfellas' this would probably be a 5 star film, but Goodfellas came first and this second. Still its a dam good movie but flawed. At 178 minutes its way too long and whilst I like the over-dubbed narration that Scorcese uses in some films, there's too much in this one, especially at the start.<br /><br />OK enough gripes, Joe Pesci is terrifying again, DeNiro is excellent and best of all Sharon Stone gives a fabulous performance and was deservedly nominated for best actress in the 1996 Academy awards. Naturally this being a Scorcese picture there are some classic moments, and some of them are extremely unpleasant.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Goodfellas you'll probably love this. If you have then you'll see that it is the work of a master filmmaker, but its not quite up to the same standard as his earlier masterpiece.
B00005614M|5.0|can't go wrong with this Miles Davis recording in your collection. With arrangements by Gerry Mulligan, Gil Evans and John Lewis this is a compilation of 12 sides recorded by the Miles Davis nonet(nine musicians). This legendary recording is a jazz classic. The music moves away from bepop which tended to smaller groups of musicians and the music from this compilation led to the birth of the cool West Coast Sound of jazz though it originated on the East Coast. Beautiful arrangements and lively tunes. Gil Evans would meet with musicians in his apartment on the top of Chinese laundry and help compose the arrangements. The list of musicians on these recordings includes Miles Davis on trumpet, Gerry Mulligan on baritone sax, Lee Konitz alto sax, Max Roach on drums. A must for any jazz collection and jazz beginner. Gil Evans would later team with Miles on Porgy and Bess, Sketches of Spain.
B000IOM1Y6|4.0|After several progressively influenced concept albums, the APP returned strongly with \\"Eye In The Sky\\".  It was a welcome return to form after the synth-heavy, boring \\"Eve\\", even though Eye is more pop than anything else they had recorded at this point.  Eye really points to the future sound APP would go for on subsequent releases.  The material is very good, and the final song \\"Old And Wise\\" should send chills down the spine of anyone with a pulse.    The remastered version adds quite a lot of brilliance and air to the recording when compared to the original Arista release.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|After countless raves from nearly every one of my horror film loving friends, I decided one day it was time for me to watch \\"Saw,\\" an indie slasher film premiering at the Sundance Film Festival as one of the \\"Midnight Movies\\" that is widely considered one of the greatest horror films of its generation. In no way does this film disappoint, no matter what you are looking for in a film.    Let's start with the story. Two young men--a doctor named Dr. Gordon, and a photographer named Adam--wake up chained to the wall in a dirty, old washroom. Neither of them know how they got there--and they don't know each other either. There is a slaughtered corpse between them eerily clutching a tape recorder and two tapes addressed to each of the men. The message is clear: one must find a way to kill the other by 6:00 that evening or they will both--along with Dr. Gordon's family--be killed.    Before long, they realize they are now victims of the Jigsaw killer--a known serial killer who captures people who do not appreciate life and force them to hurt themselves or others in order to save themselves from a bloody, gruesome, brutal, torturous death. In a series of flashbacks, ze discover more about Jigsaw, and experience previous encounters his victims' have had. We learn of Gordon and Adam's past, an obsessed detective dedicated to finding Jigsaw, and a young drug addict named Amanda who survived Jigsaw's sick \\"games\\" and is now mentally scarred. As the story unfolds, it suddenly explodes into a brilliantly twisted psychological thriller that  will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll after the shock ending and even for some time after that. Lots of hardcore gore and an INCREDIBLY SCARY atmosphere accompany this much-above-average slasher flick.    The acting is both great and dreadful at different times, but is always thoroughly realistic. Jigsaw is perfectly cast in his role. Adam was sort of an annoying character, but still managed to deliver, and Dr. Gordonseemed like some WAY overdramatic guy out of Star Trek, and was the only character in the small cast I was actually hoping to get killed.    The directing and editing is absolutely nothing to rave about and is solely why I didn't give Saw 5 stars. The flashbacks are adequetly done, sometimes poorly, but unfortunately, for a super psychological horror film like Saw, that is a huge failure and deserves negative feedback. Very fortunately, the strong storyline and sheer terrifying simple atmosphere holds the film together.    Overall--a very enjoyable movie watching experience, and it will scare the living daylights out of you if you watch it alone on a big screen with surround sound. Not one for the little kids however, as it is very violent in some select scenes (particularly the ending) but that shouldn't keep you from seeing it. Very good and much, much more and above and ultimately smarter and more brilliant the average super-violent slasher horror films that are out there today.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|This is a superb film from the opening battle scenes right through to the end. As it was directed by Ridley Scott this shouldn't surprise you, since he is one of the most consistent directors around.<br /><br />Russell Crowe takes the leading role of Maximus, a Roman General who is betrayed by the son of the Emperor and he gives a commanding performance. The authority he gives off as a Roman General is spell-binding (not to mention his impressive physical condition) and if anything I would have given best Oscar for this role rather than A Beautiful Mind. In fact its a stellar cast all round with Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings all playing good supporting roles. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the treacherous son of Marcus Aurelius and Connie Neilson his sister.<br /><br />The cinematography and cutting is excellent, and although this was made 7 or 8 years ago now, the CGI efects still look good to this day. There are some brilliant scenes inside the Colloseum, noteably where the Tigers are released during a Gladiator fight, and during the scene involving the chariots.<br /><br />Although the film is nearly 2 and 1/2 hours long, you'll never be looking at your watch during this. This is what cinema and film (and I include DVDs in this as well) were meant for. There is no basis of fact behind the story, but in the end who cares this is just great entertainment.
B000002ADT|5.0|a rainy day...I pop in 'Kind of Blue'...problems with my lover I pop in 'Kind of Blue'...feeling wistful...I pop in 'Kind of Blue'...Miles Davis on trumpet..John Coltrane on tenor sax..Cannonball Adderly on alto sax..Paul Chambers on bass..Bill Evans and Wynton Kelly on piano..drummer Jimmy Cobb..compositions composed by Davis and Evans..in an attempt to move away from bepop which dominated jazz at the time this is the first full jazz album using the modal approach which is basically composing music with a series of scales using improvisation, the results are 'Kind of Blue' one of the most influential jazz albums of all time, also recognized as one of the top albums of all time.
B000LE0THO|5.0|The music is very familiar to any ELO fan (it helps that I consider this their best album) so I'll only comment on the sound on this new remaster.  WOW!      Even if you own a first pressing vinyl copy (one of the best sounding vinyl releases ever), even if you own a Japanese copy of this on vinyl, even if you own any of the cd releases of this great album, you NEED this re-issue.  Not only does it include a few bonus tracks, the remastered 2007 version (done with Jeff Lynne's participation) is absolutely STUNNING.    The deluxe version has some impressive packaging, despite the fact that it's very difficult to get the cd out of it without major fingerprints on the disc, so casual fans might want to stick to the regular jewelbox version.  But, and I cannot emphasize this enough...if you are a fan of ELO in ANY degree, GET THIS!!!  The sound will knock you out.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|The White Stripes originally were a band that I kind of liked but not really. I always saw them as the better band in that \\"The\\" garage rock scene from the Vines to the Hives but at times many of the songs on album releases were more about them rocking out but not really delivering anything in terms of melody. Sure it's fun to just play but it would be nice if we caught that energy too. After the difficult-to-get-into album Get Behind Me Satan, the White Stripes make a return with a record that's as accessible as anything they've done.    The album starts out with Icky Thump which follows the tradition that Seven Nation Army and Blue Orchid set which is led by a catchy rock riff, particularly the \\"chorus\\". Jack sings lyrics concerning an encounter with a Mexican prostitute and while I'm not a fan of the solo at the end, it's still a great opener. The next song is another enjoyable one with You Don't Know What Love is. Big loud blues-y rocker, it's just a fun song to listen and it even has a chorus you can sing along to. What was probably meant to be the Ball and Biscuit of the album (a more blues-improv number where Jack can let his guitar flag fly), 300 M.P.H Torrential Outpour Blues just kind of meanders.    A strange contender for the best song on the album, Conquest has Mexican horns, charging guitars and probably Jack's better vocals in awhile, this sounds like the theme to a Mexican shootout. The album stumbles greatly on St. Andrew which feels more like an experiment than a song. It follows the weirdly-likable bagpipe-driven Prickly Thorn but Sweetly Thorn but St. Andrew is just ugh. Things perk up with another best song contender in Little Cream Soda which has a rocking main riff and a Spaghetti Western-tinged verse riff. Rag and Bone is also a great blues number and it just sounds so...fun. The rest of the album is fine but they might not have the immediacy of some songs but at least it ends on the country-esque Effect and Cause.    Like a lot of White Stripes songs, some of them are just so obviously good they kind of overshadow the rest, similar to how Hardest Button to Button and Seven Nation Army became immediate standouts. Icky Thump has similar problems in that a song like Bone Broke which is not bad or something like Catch Hell Blues and that these songs are fine to listen but don't really have staying power. Meg's minimilast drumming is still there and while he's great at creating gotta-learn-it guitar riffs, his solos seem sometimes like random notes than creating any sense of melody or structure. Put it this way: if you like White Stripes before, you'll still like them. If not, you just have to learn to love their weirdness.    Most rock records lately have either been same ol' same ol' (Linkin Park), directionless (Queens of the Stone Age...I'm gonna get it for that one) or good-but-overproduced (Maroon 5). With its lo-fi production, odd lyrics and quirky music, it's still one of the better rock releases so far.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love this show. It is by far the best thing that was on t.v. I can watch this dvd over and over. The cast fits so well together and the writing is perfect. If you are looking for a good show to keep you in your seat this is the dvd for you.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|I was a little underwhelmed by the special features (there should be more for a product this huge... see the most recent release of [[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] which features documentary on the span of years from producers' desire to make a new Batman to the pandemonium following its release), but as far as the FILM itself goes, without a doubt it is a 5-star story.  I put this in the same category as [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] as the two best movies I've seen in five years--interestingly they are both \\"reboots.\\"
B000JLQSW4|5.0|The sound on this new remaster blows away the original Arista cd release, but still can't touch the MFSL version (which is no longer available, and used copies go for $100+).  Probably the second best APP album (after Tales Of Mystery and Imagination) this should appeal to fans of Pink Floyd and science fiction.
0143038419|2.0|The stories of the travels and the description of those met along the way are entertaining, but I had a difficult time relating to the author.  I think this is best shown when the Ashram staff chooses her for a hostess duty referred to as \\"Little Suzy Creamcheese\\".  On a spiritual journey it is best to leave the sorority rush personality behind.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Having read the praises of some of the earlier reviewers, I had to add my two cents. This is the fourth version of the Jane Austen classic that I have seen and this one is the worst version. None of the actors were even competent in pulling off their roles, the screenplay was not at all faithful to Ms Austen's fine dialogue, the direction was lackluster and the art direction left a lot to be desired. Even the the 1940 version with its MGM/Hollywood treatment surpasses this atrocity. I was glad to have the thing over with in the end. What a waste of Judi Dench....
0743243153|5.0|A bevy of psychological and self-help books have been written since M. Scott Peck first penned this work of towering intellect. In my honest opinion, few of them have even approached THE ROAD LESS TRAVELED. For over twenty-five years millions have read his book for clarity, inspiration, enlightenment, and wisdom.  Considered a different kind of psychology/self-help work, The Road Less Traveled, approaches subjects like dependency, egos, and falling in love, with a perspective so fresh and revolutionary, that for many years it became a sort of psychological manifesto.  It addresses the painfulness that confronting our life's dilemmas can cause us, and shows how our very reluctance to deal with these problems actually result in greater dilemmas and increased pain and anxiety.  Many of the concepts so brilliantly laid out by Peck, are still not totally embraced by society. His section on love (section 2) is one of   the most unique and insightful descriptions of love written in modern times. He cogently dispels the myths of falling in love, romantic love, and love as a feeling. These three \\"myth under standings\\" are embraced by everyone from Hollywood to the couple next door. Peck clearly delineates between what he calls true, or pure love, and feelings that closely resemble love. His book is broken into four sections, Discpline, Love, Growth and Religion, and Grace, and are written from the pyschotherapeutic perspective.  After reading Peck's book,I am amazed at the range of dysfunctionality that can be reasonably attributed to a lack of mental growth and development. It is a very intriguing thought that our own mental ability to embrace reality,quite possibly holds the key to self-fulfillment and inner peace of mind.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|This cd is truely an amazing piece of work!!  If you've liked any of Brad's work in the past, 5th Gear will not disappoint.  It has its share of ballads, it has humourous songs, and it has songs that make you want to crank the radio up and drive fast!!  There's a nice instrumental too!    My favorite track is definately \\"Online.\\"  It will surely be released as a single with it's clever look at the way people's identity changes when they login on their computer.  A 5'3\\" man who is overweight and still lives at home with his mom, suddenly transforms into a 6'5\\" hunk when he goes online.  It's just plain hilarious!!    Another track worth mentioning is \\"Letter to Me.\\"  This track is what the singer would say to himself at the age of 17.  The lyrics speak of life-lessons.   This is one of his more senitmental songs.  It really describes the thought process of a young man at 17.  It is somewhat inspirational in that it describes the mindset of a 17 year old and how things seem so tough at that age, but having aged a bit, he's learned that things will only get better from there!!  wow, what a song!    If you're into ballads, you will fall in love with \\"It Did.\\"  It is obviously a slower song.  It describes several of life's little moments and how you think it can't possibly get better at the time, but guess what? It does!!! yay!    There are several fun songs on this album, besides \\"TICKS\\" and \\"Online\\".  \\"I'm still a guy\\" looks at the differences between a woman and a man.  It mentions all the things a woman will do to a man to make him more feminized, but in the end, he's still a guy.  There are some really great lyrics on this track, but I don't want to give it away so go get the album!!    Lastly, I'd just like to say that you don't have to be a Brad Paisley fan, or even a country fan to find something on this album that you will enjoy.  The spectrum of songs is so vast that there is something for everyone.  What are you waiting for?  Get this album, you will be amazed! \\"*****\\"
185984054X|4.0|As someone who discovered Hitchen's by watching the TV show BS, and also having started recently reading some of his other material(Letters to.., God is not..) I already knew most of what I was to find in this book.  While Hitchens has become a favorate author recently, I find having reviewed a great deal of his material that alot of it tends to repeat itself.<br /><br />While I don't want to seriously downplay the enjoyment of the book to quickly, I did feel like he was trying to stretch out the material a bit far.  The negetive aspects of any single person in the public sphere can usually only be so far documented, I do think that perhaps the Mother Teresa fraud may of served Hitchens better if he chosen to make it just a smaller part of a larger book on a larger subject.  I would love to see Hitchens do a book taking on solely the Catholic Church for instance(although, now he has taken on religion as a whole, an anwser to every thinking man's prayers).  However, those interested in Mother Teresa, religious criticism or just the general works of Hitchens will find themselves engrossed quickly into this book, and barely 100 pages, one can finish it in a couple spare hours with little problem.<br /><br />Recommended.
B00005JPLW|4.0|OK, I saw the original movie \\"The 300 Spartans\\" when I was a kid.  It was awe inspiring to me.  Not any more.  I was only a kid then and have since lived through more than 40 years of Hollywood technological advancement.  This film uses all of them.  It is shot in an almost surreal style like you've never experienced in a live action film.  300 gives you a wonderfully historic accounting of the Spartan way of life from birth through the training of the male youth for military service.  Now the set-up for the     film is complete.  Now you never blink.  If you never see another film portraying a historical event, do not miss this one.  You will watch it a second, third and fourth time before you start on your 5th, 6th, etc.
0783231032|1.0|As with another user who wrote in a review, I found this in a discount bin at Wal-Mart. I'd always been aware of the movie, at least from a musical point of view, because John Williams recorded the march and \\"Swing! Swing! Swing!,\\" his Benny Goodman pastiche, when he was with the Boston Pops Orchestra. (Both are wonderful pieces of music.) But I'd never seen the film. Now I wish I hadn't.    I'm sorry, but this thing misfires in almost every gag. There are some wonderful concepts here, and some hysterical situations (in both senses of the word). And some fine slapstick visuals. But the whole thing is so incredidbly heavy-handed and forced that whatever humor should have been there is crushed to death. In his comments in the bonus material for this DVD (taken quite obviously from a laser-disc version released many years ago), even Spielberg admits that the film should have been funnier. I'll see his bet and raise it: It should have been funny.    Laurel & Hardy could have done the destruction bit in far less time and on a shoestring budget and it would have been funny. The same thing happened a few years ago with a film called MOUSE HUNT, in which an entire mansion is destroyed. Again, L&H did it better in less time. Woody Allen, I believe, once said that any comedy over 90 minutes is doomed to failure. A \\"comedy\\" like this, running two hours and 20-some minutes, is sheer torture.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is one of those rare movies that not only captures one's imagination, but tugs at the heartstrings as well. The movie explores the story of beloved children's author/illustrator, Beatrix Potter [Renee Zellweger] who finds her parents' lifestyle and social ambitions cloying and snobbish. She writes & illustrates stories for children as a way of escaping this rigid life. However, her efforts at getting published and taken seriously as an author face several stumbling blocks [this is after all England in the early 1900s] until she meets Norman Warner[ Ewan Mc Gregor] and together they make history with the publication of The Tale of Peter Rabbit. Their romance is portrayed in such an understated manner yet effective in showing their genuine love and affection for one another. This movie reminded me of Finding Neverland [with Johnny Depp as J.M. Barrie] but not as dark and much more uplifting. Renee Zellweger is enchanting in her role as Miss Potter[except for the awful British accent], and Ewan McGregor is convincing in his role as her love interest.Emily Watson shines in her role as Norman's sister who develops a genuine friendship with Potter. The cinematography deserves special mention - the lush depictions of the English countryside, the Lake Country is beautiful. All in all, it is an inspiring tale of perseverance, love, loss, & convictions that is sure to uplift one's spirit.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  Michael Buble has a sound reminescent of Frank Sinatra with a blend of Harry Connick Jr but adds his own style to make the songs his own.  I could've done without the lisping in \\"I've Got The World On A String\\".  I don't know if he was trying to be cute but it didn't work for me.  But over all this is a really good CD and well worth the purchase.
B000LC3ID8|4.0|All I gotta say is that the Saw franchise continues to impress me. I mean, Tobin Bell can do no wrong as Jigsaw the killer!!! He is truly an amazing actor. Now as for the storyline, it is a simple yet very intense one. Jigsaw and Amanda have set up another twisted game for two people. One is a female doctor who is having an affair on her husband and the other is a man who hasn't come to terms with the death of his young son. Who was the victim of a car accident at the hands of a drunk driver. But the two of them will have to figure out their connection to one another, to survive Jigsaw's game and to make matters worse. Jigsaw may not have that long to live, as he too must fight to stay alive long enough to finish is his dangerous game.
0060934913|5.0|Bourdain's style and the entertainment value of each anecdote make this book a fun diversion and something of a learning experience.
1400063515|1.0|After reading \\"Fooled By Randomness\\", I eagerly looked forward to reading Taleb's latest book, only to be disappointed.  He mentions both in the prologue and acknowledgments, \\"the book just wrote itself\\", and it shows.  He could have fitted most of the 300 pages into 50 and gotten his points across.  In any event, this book does not add anything more to \\"Fooled By Randomness\\" (194 pages) and is often rambling and incoherent.  Perhaps if one read The Black Swan first, it may have been interesting but not if you read Taleb's previous excellent book.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|minutes to midnight is an awesome album!  first listen fans will know that it's totally and completely different from their previous albums.  the whole album - the lyrics, the music, the video, the album cover...everything has been intelligently put together and produced this yet another best from Linkin Park boys!  track 3 leave out all the rest is a simple song with simple lyrics...still the meaning has great impact which i believe everyone can relate to whereas track 4 bleed it out is such a fun song...never fail me to sing along the chorus and make me smile whenever listening to it.  :)  track 10 in between...for the first time we hear mike singing solo non-rap sound so true and flawless...ahhh.  to me all songs are with stories whether experienced by individuals or not...we're ticked with our own conscious and at the same time enjoyable to listen to over and over again.  :)  for those who bought this cd must also buy the dvd combo...it's always fun to watch them talk and get an insight of making their album...so go get it!  :)
B000PHX4VA|4.0|OK, what you get with this collection is far superior to any previous collection. I'll give you that. However, it is still incomplete. As has already been pointed out the most glaring omission is \\"When The World Is Running Down...\\" Yes, \\"Don't Stand So Close '86\\" should be here too. However, I can understand it's omission as making that record was a bone of contention with the band in '86. My biggest gripe is where the hell is \\"Secret Journey\\"? It was a hit on my planet!<br /><br />Each disc has 14 tracks and could've easily fit 15. I would give this collection 5 stars if they would've just made it an even 30 songs and included:<br /><br />\\"Secret Journey\\"<br />\\"When The World Is Running Down...\\"
B00003CXD0|5.0|Tootsie is a great movie.  I loved it as a kid and will still watch it anytime it's on.  Dustin Hoffman played Dorothy which such class and he recently elaborated on why he took the part on AFI's 100 Years/100 Films special.  He said to his wife that he had to play the part and she asked why.  He said because he would make an \\"interesting looking\\" woman and he began to realize all of the wonderful women he never had a chance to know in his life because of their interesting appearances and just dismissing them, as Dorothy was dimissed.  He was almost in tears as he said this, which teared me up.  It's THAT passion that he put into the character of Dorothy and made the story so much more than the script intended.
0441009425|4.0|This is one of the best, most technically detailed hard sci-fi novels I've read in a long time, if ever.  If you're reading this review, you probably already know that the author, Alastair Reynolds, has a Ph.D. in astrophysics.  He has constructed a magificently detailed universe in which to set his story.  The technical points of his ships, his worlds are explained in great detail.  He also understands the physics of interstellar travel and related phenomona (i.e. the velocities, the energies, the timescales, and the dynamics of planets, ships, etc. and how they interact).  This is the most technical hard sci-fi that I've ever read, and is better (and more detailed) that the works of Gregory Benford, Robert Forward, and other scientists who have written sci-fi novels.<br /><br />The story itself is a complex and well-written mystery about the destruction of an ancient civilization on another planet.  Plot summaries are given in other reviews, I won't repeat them.  There are initially several independent threads that are woven together as the story progress (much like Vonnegut), but the main plot revolves are the destruction of an ancient non-human civilization found on the planet Resurgam.  Reynolds creates a dark future in which man has colonized several planets beyond Earth, but travel between the them is limited relativistic travel.  Thus it takes years or decades to travel between the planets.  There are only a small number of ships capable of interstellar travel, so planetary visits are few and far between.  They are essentially islands that are only rarely visited by offworlders.  One of the most interesting aspects of the novel is the pilots/crew of these ships, they are cyborgs who were at one time human but now are mostly machine and are no longer driven by human motivations.  The planets described in this novel are not nice places, and the citizens are afflicted with many of the same problems as modern man:  war, corruption, greed, etc.<br /><br />My one negative comment about this book is that the prose is way too ponderous.  100-150 pages could easily have been cut out of this story.  It is not that I'm against long novels when the extra words add detail or information, but there are long passages in this book where the action just drags in ways that don't advance the story, provide information or background for the reader, or develop the characater.  This novel definitely needed to be better edited.  Additionally, the characters are not particularly well developed.  They all struck me as flat, and I couldn't sympathize with any of them.  I think that the technical detail and writing style may be offputting to some (Reynolds definitely writes like a scientist).  Bottom line is that is a great hard sci-fi novel, but too wordy.  A tighter story with better character development would have launched this to an all time classic.  A great start though, and I now intend to catch up on all of AR's other novels.about this book is that the prose is way too ponderous.  100-150 pages could easily have been cut out of this story.

B000B5XOY8|5.0|The other reviews contained here seem to divide into preferring Burton's original \\"Batman\\" vs the new \\"Batman Begins\\".  I have some thoughts on this.<br /><br />First, let me say I much prefer Burton's film.  I find it's baroque theatricality far more interesting and entertaining than \\"Begins\\" attempt to shoehorn Bruce Wayne/Batman into something like the real world.  It always seemed to me the approach on \\"Batman\\" was to ask \\"what kind of world could have created these people?\\".  \\"Begins\\" approach is to ask \\"what would these people be like in the real world?\\".  I suspect that the \\"Begins\\" franchise may run into significant problems as it tries to reconcile some of Batman's more exotic villains into that reality.<br /><br />Despite having no super powers, Batman is a mythic character.  He doesn't belong in everyday reality.  None of Burton's films are set in reality.  Like myths and fairy-tales, they exist in a parallel reality that informs our own.<br /><br />The last point I'll include here is the CHARACTER of Batman himself (not the actors or their performances: they're both excellent).<br />By the end of \\"Begins\\" he has pretty much overcome his childhood traumas (bats & loss of parents) and the decision to become/remain Batman is a conscious, rational choice.  (What a swell guy.)<br />That's OK, but not nearly as interesting as what they did in \\"Batman\\". In Burton's films he is almost like a drug addict.  There is no altruism here.  He MUST be Batman to deal with his inner demons.  Repression creates perversion and 'Batman' is what has oozed out of the cracks in Bruce Wayne's psyche.  Anyone who has to create as elaborate a coping mechanism as Batman must be really screwed up.  Wayne must be Batman or go mad.  Perhaps he has done both.  Burton's version of Batman may be less \\"real\\" but it is far more human.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.  Also- Danny Elfman's score rocks and the Batmobile in \\"Begins\\" sucks!
0553278223|4.0|This is a terrific collection of short stories that provide a social commentary through the lens of humanity's travel to and exploration of Mars.  The social commentary really relates to the 1940s and 1950s though, I think that modern readers are likely to have trouble identifying with the issues described in the book.  The topics covered by the stories in this book include man's destructive impulses, nuclear war/annihilation, racism, among a host of others.  Bradbury paints a bleak picture of humanity and humanity's fate.  It isn't as if these problems don't exist in the 21st century, of course, they just aren't as important in our collective psyche nor are they framed in the same manner.  I think that the primary interest in this book for the 21st century reader is historic - to see how science fiction and social criticism provide a window into the world of the 1950s.  The message(s) of this book just won't be so relevant to 21st century readers.  If you are looking for an action story with lots of bugs being slaughtered, this definitely isn't the place.  There are also some really dated ideas (e.g. the mass availability of rocket ships for travel between Earth and Mars or simply to travel around Mars).  Before reading this book I rented the TV miniseries made in the 70s.  This miniseries is surprisingly close to the novel and would provide a good companion to the book.
0399230033|5.0|Good book for the nightly ritual of getting your child to go to bed.  Great because it's a board books so your child can't rip the pages.  The pictures are so well done that they do all the talking.
B000A88F22|1.0|In some ways, I understand this completely.  When you have just met someone, and you're in the throws of infatuation, you want nothing but to declare how much you love the person no matter how great a catch or how big a loser they may be.  You stare at each other, hold hands, kiss, hug, etc., and you don't mind who sees it.  And, you usually make more than one person sick and you loose a friend or two over it.  Britney, however, didn't just loose a friend or two but lost a whole lot more.    This is a snapshot of Britney and Kevin's love in the beginning.  Like a reviewer said here in this forum, it's like that Dave Chappelle stetch \\"When Keeping It Real Goes Too Far\\".  They want to show us how much they love each other (or at least how much Britney loved K Fed in the beginning), and even though they're celebrities they are just like us.  The problem is that our everyday lives are just as boring as theirs are, and it's not entertaining to hear the mundane conversations and see just how trashy they are.    The night vision and bad dialogue are meant to be funny, but they come off as things only they would find funny.  Now, they are no more, and Britney's apparently clean and sober.  Good for her, I guess.  Bet she's pretty embarassed by this now.
B000002KB8|3.0|Musically this is a 5-star album and I agree with most of the glowing reviews, with one caveat. The people who mastered this onto CD made one glaring and idiotic mistake- they burned 7 songs onto 5 tracks. I do not consider \\"Wasp\\", \\"Bassically\\" or \\"A Bit of Finger\\" to be separate songs- they are intros but \\"Behind the Wall of Sleep\\" and \\"NIB\\" ARE two separate songs. Ditto for \\"Sleeping Village\\" and \\"Warning\\". There is no reason or excuse for the two separate songs to be glued together onto single tracks. If you want to hear \\"Warning\\" (my favorite Sabbath song) or \\"NIB\\" by itself you have to pretend you are listening to a tape and fast-forward through several minutes,which would not have been necessary had the execs paid attention to what they were doing.      To fix the problem, you would have to rip the album to the computer and edit the sound files-I did. Because this fix is possible I would still recommend this album to someone reading the reviews, but the way it had been mastered- with separate songs glued together onto single tracks, was annoying and stupid. When CDs  came out the same people who mastered this album mastered the 2-record \\"We Sold Our Soul\\" anthology onto 1 CD by cutting out \\"Warning\\" A decision which gave my favorite Sabbath song the shaft.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|An excellent new Queens of the Stone age album every two-and-a-half years or so has become something of a tradition, so while the high quality of their most recent release is no surprise, it's certainly no less pleasant for it.  QOTSA have always been able to maintain a balance between rock's opposite poles--arty without being pretentious, technically proficient without being mechanical, heavy without being angry--and Era Vulgaris does nothing to interrupt that streak, delivering more of the narcotizing, classic-minded hard rock that Josh Homme has been delivering since he formed the band out of the ashes of the even-greater Kyuss.  Building on the sounds of the band's previous four albums without cannibalizing them, Era Vulgaris is yet another excellent album in the QOTSA tradition--loosely constructed, wide-ranging, and determinedly rocking, with none of the woe-is-me drivel that weighs down so much of what passes for rock music these days.  And as usual, it's littered with the muscular, surging guitars and smart melodies that have become Josh's stock in trade, making this yet another classic album for blasting in your car with the windows open.  Despite their well-documented history of heavy turnover, the band actually sounds as tight as ever here, taking about ten seconds of the opening Turnin' On the Screw to lock into a killer groove that never quite lets up until the album ends.  The following Sick, Sick, Sick is even better, bringing a manic, rapid-fire energy to the proceedings, with vocals that are less sung than declaimed over a backup of speedy metallic riffage.  Some might proclaim Make it Wit Chu too mellow and playful to fit on a QOTSA album, but I actually found its bouncy, piano-tinged arrangements and insinuating crooned refrain to be perfectly in keeping with the band's traditional good time-oriented approach.  Of course, just in case anyone does find that track overly lightweight, Josh & Co. follow it up the with the memorably intense riff-rock of 3's and 7's before skidding into the laid-back, trippy haze of Suture up Your Future.  And while many QOTSA albums have petered out on the final few tracks, Era Vulgaris is not one of them--Run, Pig, Run fires out of the blocks with a wall of thick, hard-pounding riffs and harsh noises backing a winding, ominous vocal.  It's certainly not the first song to highlight a darker, more visceral aspect to the Queens' sound, but with the possible exception of the last album's Someone's in the Wolf it may be best, and it brings a suitable conclusion to yet another top-notch album in Josh Homme's ever-expanding catalogue.f 3's and 7's before skidding into the laid-back, trippy haze of Suture up Your Future.

B00006L3S3|3.0|I'm looking at some of these lyrics here, and for the most part I'm not all that impressed. Which is sad, because John's supposed to be good at writing lyrics. You wouldn't know by listening to songs like \\"Tight A$\\", \\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\\", \\"Intuition\\", or \\"Meat City\\", though. Musically, there are also a couple bad ideas (an enormous choir on \\"One Day (At a Time)\\", pedal steel on \\"You Are Here\\"). So the best songs are the good ol' fashioned revolutionary ones: \\"Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People)\\", the wonderful title song; \\"Only People\\". And a couple of the above poorly-written songs have some merit: \\"Intuition\\" has a bouncy melody and interesting keyboards; \\"Tight A$\\", a slide guitar. And I do like the gentle, sensitive \\"Out of the Blue\\" and the almost Macca-like \\"I Know (I Know)\\". This is no better than Plastic Ono Band or even Imagine and Double Fantasy- it is a jumble of an album, after all. Just a moderately enjoyable one.
B0007XTOKC|5.0|Having just paid almost $50 for an FTD (Follow That Dream) label 2-CD set of \\"Elvis Is Back\\", you can imagine that I was expecting some excellent entertainment value.  FTD has delivered again!  This INCREDIBLY fine sounding re-master of the 1960 Elvis Is Back LP---plus singles and outtakes from its associated March and April 1960 RCA Nashville sessions---is worth every nickel.    It is fun to hear the excitement build as Elvis and the band work through early versions of classic tracks like \\"Such A Night\\", \\"A Mess Of Blues\\", \\"Soldier Boy\\", \\"The Girl Of My Best Friend\\", \\"Fame And Fortune\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Dirty, Dirty Feeling\\", \\"It's Now Or Never\\" and MORE.  Elvis experiments with an assortment of interesting vocal phrasings, and the guys fool around with tempo and instrumentation as the session progresses.  His operatic range on \\"It's Now Or Never\\" is legendary, and the emotion Elvis puts into \\"Soldier Boy\\" is stunning-- it is powerfully elegant...especially so on takes 1, 2 and 3.  Eventually, take 15 of \\"Soldier Boy\\" (with a smoother vocal and what seems like a slightly faster tempo) became the \\"master\\"--the track chosen for the album.    Listening to this beautifully re-mastered CD, one feels as if they are there in real-time; not \\"were there\\", but ARE THERE-- in the control booth-- as the sessions come to life; the mix, and the instruments, particularly the bass guitar, have never sounded this good on a consumer release.  FTD has done a terrific job; this true stereo mix has been opened up spatially (but not overdone), and the light touch of EQ, reverb and general lack of compression (revealing greater dynamic range) are much appreciated.    These were Elvis' first post-army studio sessions.  He was in fine voice-- and you can HEAR the maturing of his vocal talent (range, interpretation and emotive achievement) revealing a refined, yet fresh new style.  The choice of material also speaks volumes...country, blues, gospel, doo-wop, rock and wonderfully navigated pop.  Ifyou've ever wondered what Elvis is all about...this is a good place to learn.  I can't imagine any singer alive today who could even come close to the capabilities of this guy.    This also represents (I believe) the first Elvis 3-track recordings...which means that the (then) new technology has joyously preserved what is truly an amazing collection of music production.  Remember, Elvis recorded 'live to tape' with the band backing him in real-time as he made these hits...no going back later (like producers today can do with 8, 16, 24, 48 and 64-track machines).  In this environment, Elvis feeds off the band, and the band feeds off Elvis' performances.  To use the 's' word (synergy) here is appropriate---and not a surrender to the lure of the cliché.    This is a most compelling package of Elvis' early 60s pop, rock and blues tracks.  When you hear the original album and single hit MASTERS-- alongside the outtakes and alternate versions-- you gain a great appreciation for the recoding process and the undeniable talent of Presley, his musicians and the Jordanaires (his long-time background singers).    With 53 tracks-- this trip back in time lasts about 2 hours.  You will want to listen to this on a quality stereo system...not mini-headphones.  (Don't wait too long.  FTD only presses a limited number of discs.  They may not re-issue because of the high production costs for what could be a potentially small market of second run sales.)    At first, the $50 price tag may seem too high, unless you consider this more of a time trip; in that light, $50 for the price of a ticket to take you back to two special nights, March 20, 1960 and April 3, 1960...and put you on a front-row chair INSIDE RCA's Nashville studios as you listen to Elvis work out on the other side of the glass...well, $50 seems like the deal of a lifetime.    Can you imagine how Elvis fans would feel TODAY--if someone had made arrangements back THEN--to film all, or even part, of his return to music making?  In the absence of such a visual recording, close your eyes and open your other senses as you experience what all of America learned in the spring of 1960: \\"Elvis Is Back\\".
B00005YW4H|5.0|I knew that Nora Jones was good music but i had no idea just how good...My sister-in-law bought me this CD for Father's Day...i have listened to it 3 times today. The way i would describe her lyrics and delivery is equal to \\"Musical Rose Petals\\". So smooth and so inviting is her voice. I really love the Piano work also. Her birth name being \\"Geethali\\",Nora Jones along with the likes of Michael Buble have added a nice,new,fresh selection of music to today's currently enemic sound. This album made her only the second artist ever to sweep the \\"Big Four\\" being Album,Song,Record,& Artist of the Year at the Grammy Awards in 2003. Standouts for me include: \\"Come Away With Me\\",\\"Don't Know Why\\", and i really like her rendition of Hank Williams SR.'s \\"Cold,Cold Heart\\". With her throw back to Billie Holiday/Roberta Flack days voice coupled with a very welcomed piano based style, Nora Jones can take me away anytime! If you've waited to give her a listen ,as did I, do yourself a favor and don't wait any longer.
B000P2A24W|4.0|I agree with one of the other posters who mentioned this was the best album Bon Jovi has put out since These Days.  The songwriting is solid, a  marked improvement over the last two true albums (Have a Nice Day & Bounce).  As others have stated, the whole country thing has been overblown.  I attribute that to the media just jumping on a label.  There is some country influence, but mostly it's pure rock, in my opinion (e.g. We Got it Going On).  Quite a bit of blues/soul in there also, especially in Richie's guitar work.  Sounds a lot like what he put out on his 98 album Undiscovered Soul.  Jon's vocals really sound improved as compared to the last several albums as well.  A good effort after coming off a fairly lackluster album in Have a Nice Day.  Definitely a solid album all around.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|For a band that exists based on constrictions, the White Stripes increase their versatility with each album.  Yes, there are blues stompers and rockers, but Icky Thump has bagpipes, mariachi trumpets, and an ethereal spoken word number by Meg.    For those looking for traditional White Stripes blues rock, you have Catch Hell Blues, I'm Slowly Turning Into You, and the stand outs Bone Broke and 300 MPH Outpour Blues.  And then there's the title track, which, while rocking, ventures into oddball territory with one of the first synthesizers ever made, with a deep Moog-ish sound, and some politically-minded but slightly inscrutable lyrics.  The bagpipe \\"suite\\" Prickly Thorn But Sweetly Worn/St. Andrew is, according to Jack White, a nod to both Stripes' Scottish heritage, the first which would have been in good company on the Cold Mountain soundtrack, the second a noisy ditty featuring Meg's spoken word, which fortunately improves with multiple listens.  The other standout tracks are Conquest, a Patty Page cover which mixes trumpets with Jack's pounding guitar riffs, Effect and Cause, the fun Loretta Lynnish closer, and Rag and Bone, a blues track that sums up the ideology behind the Stripes and this album in particular- Jack and Meg go searching for other people's junk to \\"give it a home\\" and \\"make something out of it.\\"    For her part, Meg's drumming has never sounded better.  And Jack, in this humble reviewer's opinion, is THE songwriter of our generation.  Even some of the lesser tracks are better than almost anything else out these days.    With each listen I'm finding something new to love about Icky Thump, and more to love from my (obviously) favorite band.
0553801503|2.0|As much as I loved books 1, 2 and 3, I was deeply disappointed in 4 for the same reasons others have stated: the book is sorely in need of an editing. Martin is a very talented writer and I enjoyed the book once I lowered my expectatons; but I was deeply discouraged to lose another favorite author to bloated book syndrome. I have nothing against massive tomes provided they go beyond the plot equivalent of playing with your food. My former favorite author, Robert Jordan, has done the same with his last several books. Have these authors become so big because of their early successes that no editor feels worthy enough to call them on the carpet for their self-indulgence? Ultimately, he is the author and is free to do as he will. But it would be nice to be respected as a reader by authors delivering on the goods and not padding a series, whether for financial profit or just because they enjoy writing the series so much.
B00005O3VC|5.0|It's easy to dismiss this movie and everything done by the Monty Python troupe as silly, throw-away. But you would be doing yourself a huge disservice. There's an underlying deep understanding of the very legends and events the boys are making such merry fun of.    This 'special edition' was not worth it if you look at it from the point of view of the extra scene - it truly is throw-away. However, the extras range from interesting (how the castle was used in various and sundry scenes) to funny (how to get your own coconuts and run like a silly person around the castle grounds).    As I said, merry fun. Hilarious... don't miss this movie!
0679759328|4.0|It took me forever to get into \\"Hotel du Lac.\\" I love Jane Austen and I love Anne Tyler and this books sorta straddles both and was recommended to me by a used bookstore owner who said his wife liked it.  Finally after several chapters I got hooked and I read it slowly enough to relish it. I lived in Geneva and Basle so I could understand the place and was fascinated to read her version of Lake Geneva. The book slowly unfolds and has the unexpected twists you get in mysteries and at the end you are still puzzling - it isn't so neat in fact like a good movie it makes you want to go out and discuss it with others. The reviews here make me think the people who are reading it prefer action novels and would be the last people I'd like to discuss this book with.    But I really loved it. I'm only sorry every one says it's her best as I'd like to read others by her and not be disappointed.
0679805273|5.0|When I purchased this book my twins were about 26 months old, and when I opened it to take a quick read I thought it would be too long and difficult for them to concentrate.  Boy! Was I wrong!!  My girls sat and listened to the entire thing - cover to cover.  Listening and looking as if they understood every word (and perhaps they did!!).  I was thrilled and they ask me to read them that book each night - so page by page we look at the great illustrations and read together (since now - at two and a half they know what comes next).<br /><br />Another thing about this book is - its message - it's so inspirational.  It can be a gift for a graduate, a child going to camp, etc.  It's beautiful the way it talks about life and the process of independence - going out on your own.  Absolutely LOVELY!!!
B00025ETIW|5.0|This album is outstanding.  I am a big System of a Down fan, and usually can't put there stuff down.  I have been an MCR fan for about six months.  I just happened to hear I'm Not OK, and thought it was one of the best songs I ever heard.  I don't listen to radio much, nor do I watch a bunch of music videos.  But I have to say it impressed me enough to go buy this cd, and between this and the Black Parade, I am astonished.  I literally have not listened to anything else, but maybe a few times since I started listening to them.  Once you get hooked on one song long enough, you end up getting hooked on something else.  There isn't a single bad song on this cd.  The lyrics and the music, just go so great together.  Do yourself a favor and join the parade, you won't regret it.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|MISS POTTER is a film that is beautiful to watch, is heartwarming, and shows how a minimal story line can give an inside picture of the life of a  famous person without superimposing the brouhaha that Hollywood usually frosts biographies.<br /><br />England 1902 is the time we meet Beatrix Potter (Ren&eacute;e Zellweger), a spinster in her late twenties whose life is centered on her 'friends' - the little animal figures who grace her stories, friends like Peter Rabbit, Jemima Puddle Duck, Jeremy Fisher, Tom Kitten, Hunca Munca etc - as she attempts to have her illustrated children's stories published.  Her overbearing mother (Barbara Flynn) disapproves of Beatrix' preoccupation with matters other than proper marriage and her father (Bill Patterson) supports her art but knows his daughter is not a 'fine artist'.  Yet on a fluke Beatrix wins over the publishing firm of the Warne Brothers: offering to publish her books is more to appease the youngest brother Norman (Ewan McGregor) who pleads for a project that will make him part of the family business than to lend credibility to Potter's output.  Potter and Norman Warne connect over the simple beauty of the books and with Norman's sister Millie (Emily Watson) the three find success in a difficult industry - one especially onerous for female authors.<br /><br />The story of Norman and Beatrix's developing love, appalling to her parents, includes a period of parental imposed separation as Beatrix moves to the Lake Country to write and paint and continue her growing passion for Norman in delicate letters.  Norman succumbs to an illness and his death devastates Beatrix and Millie.  Beatrix manages to temper her mourning with a newfound passion in the Lake Country, and with the help of  her old friend William Heelis (Lloyd Owen), she purchases her Lake Country home and as one of the first 'environmentalists' she buys the surrounding farms to prevent their destruction by corporate industrial greed.  Beatrix Potter has become a wealthy woman through her own triumph as a writer and illustrator of children's books and finds restored happiness in securing the fairytale countryside where her 'friends' continue to help her weave tales that remain to this time some of the world's finest stories.<br /><br />The visuals of this film, from the opening sequences of watercolor preparation to the enchanting vistas of the Lake Country, are stunningly beautiful. The script by Richard Maltby, Jr. remains rather superficial, but director Chris Noonan makes the best of a thin storyline to create a warmly human view of Potter.  Ren&eacute;e Zellweger as Beatrix inhabits the roles in all but her flawed British accent, a factor that unfortunately stretches credibility in the presence of the rest of the professional cast.  But she captures Potter's determination and vulnerability and in the end she wins our hearts.

0316067598|5.0|This book is a compelling, easy read that you will find hard to put down.  The first part takes you through SEAL  training in Coronado, CA and gives you a deep appreciation for just how hard it is to become a SEAL, while the second half takes you through a harrowing battle that in many ways validates just why the SEAL selection and training process is so difficult and so effective.    The battle sequence in Afghanistan and its aftermath is incredibly intense .  The best screen writer in Hollywood couldn't have dreamt  up something more intense, moving, and awe inspiring.  If they make it into a movie it will in some ways be like a Afghani inspired version of Full Metal Jacket.    Reading this fills one with humility and gratitude for the sacrifice that all the members of our armed services make on our behalf, but especially for the men of the SEAL teams.  All I can say is that I am very glad they are on our side.    As an aside, if you enjoy books like this you should check out Bravo Two Zero by Andy McNab, an SAS operative who served in the first Iraq war.   I found it highly ironic that in both cases great misfortune results from acts of human mercy that elite soldiers felt compelled to take despite the clear risk it posed to their own lives.  These books should be required reading for anyone who questions the character and moral fiber of such brave men.

B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Everything you have heard about Wolfmother is true.  The most important claims: 1) They are in fact the true founders of Spaghetti Monsterism; 2) At live performances they cast spells on their audience and \\"melt faces off\\" and 3) Recently discovered writings of Sir Isaac Newton prophetize that in 2008, Wolfmother will become the biggest rock band in the world.    While the flashy part of Newton's writings has been widely published (Armagaedon in 2060, oooh.  BORing), the writings also contain the following prediction, translated from old-timey language for the modern reader.    \\"Throughout the summer of 2007, a little known three piece band from the Southern Hemisphere will build excitement among the nations of the West.  Word will spread of these quirky lads who are able to cast spells over and \\"melt the faces off\\" of the patrons who attend their performances.  They will win over a new audience with a performance in support of a campaign to save the planet.    At the end of the year, they will retire to a castle in Bohemia to record their second album.  In 2008, the band will emerge from the forest and into the living rooms of unsuspecting and disaffected former rock and rollers, who can actually be overheard saying things like, \\"The Kids Bop version of John Mayer's latest wasn't bad.\\"  This album makes critics take back all of the \\"derivative\\" remarks, and the band reunites the many warring factions of rock, culminating with a spellbinding performance in a large new coliseum in Great Britain.  The lost children of rock will remove their skinny ties and eye makeup, the slackers will rise from their slumbers as their brains, in response to actual rock music, produce the testosterone they lack naturally, and Nickelback will be banished to the far reaches of hell.\\"    All of this will take place in accordance with the prophecy.  Which may be why Wolfmother feels confident in letting a band that is their exact opposite open for them on their new U.S. tour, which kickedoff last night in Kansas City, MO.  The Softlightes are good, but they are early Death Cab.  When Wolfmother took the stage, just as you have heard, they proceeded to cast their spell and melt the faces of the entire crowd.  Indie kids who tagged along with their girlfriends were seen speaking in tongues (or because they no longer had lips, they were actually shouting, \\"Wolfmother is rocking the S*%T out of me!\\").    This album does not do the band justice.  I'm not sure a recording ever could.  Wolfmother must be experienced.  That's why although I give this album five stars, I must recommend NOT buying it, at least not right now.  Borrow it from your roommate or cubicle neighbor and put it on layaway, er, on your wishlist.  Then spend the money on a ticket to their show, because that is the only way to experience Wolfmother, and they are coming to your town.  Go see them now before they fulfill the prophecy, and you have to do your brother-in-law a favor for him to let you in the back gate at the Meadowlands because tickets are half your salary.    Before Wolfmother becomes ... Legend.
0374105235|5.0|No matter how you slice it, Ishmael Beah is an amazing man.    This autobiographical account of his life details how a happy, cheerful young boy became a merciless soldier at the age of thirteen (and was not the oldest by far). How he went form living with his family in a small village in Sierra Leone to being a drug-addicted killer, ready to gun down anyone who got in the way. Not just killing people, but often doing so in especially brutal ways.    Most importantly it details his transformation back from the brink of seemingly endless death and violence into a college-educated young man and exceptional writer.    This is, without a doubt, one of the most harrowing, heartbreaking and moving stories I have ever read. Beautiful and honestly written. Passionate and personal, but also painting a larger picture of a world most of will, thank goodness, never experience.    For me personally the image that remains most stark is one of a neighbor of Ishmael's, a boy about his age, who is fleeing their village. The boy is carrying a sack of goods from his family's home. The only things he has left of his entire world. But it slows him down, then gets caught between a couple stumps. What happens to the boy is up to the reader to guess, but given that he was being shot at at the time, the likely conclusion is all too grim.    (rant approaching) Too often we Americans, comfortable in our relatively easy lives, are inclined to forget the rest of the world. If you asked the average person on the street to name five countries in Africa, they MIGHT get Egypt and South Africa, and then would probably wind up including Afghanistan. Our ignorance about the rest of the world in general and Africa in particular is inexcusible.    More than just about anything else this book convinces me that we, as a nation, need to do some sort of \\"Marshall Plan\\" for Africa. We can't go in with guns and bombs and make them like us. But we can go in with money, and schools, and medicine. Africa has allthe resources it needs to be doing well. But they nevertheless continue to basically suck. Something must be done.    I highly recommend this book to readers 10 years or older. I especially recommend it to people who are in their early teens. Perhaps they can learn the horrible lessons Ishmael learned at their age without going through the traumas he experienced.    The one real criticism I have of the book is that, like \\"The Sopranos\\", it didn't END, so much as just STOP. One moment things are happening, you turn the page, and that's it. It's a minor complaint, but it's still there.    This is a book about horrible, horrible war, violence and despair. But it's also a book about hope. I started this review with a quote from Shakespeare, but I shall end with a quote from Cicero who once observed that, \\"While there's life, there's hope.\\"
B000N4SHPS|5.0|This is the best Rocky since the first one.  Has all the heart and emotion of the first 2 and none of the fluff.  In fact, if there wasn't a fight at the end, I would have been just as happy.  (although the fight was great!)  Enjoy!
0634023020|5.0|Great book but not for a beginner. This product and I would say most jazz books should be for only for an experienced guitar player unless you really have the desire to sit down and spend alot of time learning the songs. The companion CD is great and I actually listen to it on it's own.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The show took 5 years to make with a huge budget. The first 2 minutes of the show, it already amazes you.  Its worth the price! Its the best in Blu-ray.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Okay I've read the oter reviews posted here and I have to say it,s cute. Cute the the way many of worked album titles into the review. Lot of very critical \\"fans\\" here. Seems everyone would be happy if Rush just kept putting out \\"Moving Pictures\\" over and over again. But I remember hearing a lot of this about \\"Signals\\" too. And it's a classic album.<br /><br />I for one am a fan going back \\"2112\\", the first Rush album I ever heard. I have watched and listened, and often been disapointed with various albums. Truth be told I didn't like \\"Signals\\" at first. But now I love it. Conversely I loved \\"Presto\\" right from the get go.<br /><br />\\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a good album, that I'm sure will grow on me. And as for taking a simpler approach, That's not Rush. And I hope it never will be.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|First of all, coming from a long time Brad fan who has seen him on the road many times whole heartedly approves of this album.  Another review said that it is no \\"time well wasted\\" album, in my opinion this album is of equal quality which really says alot.  Some of the best tracks on this album are definately \\"Letter to me\\" which is i think one of Bad's best songs of his entire career, followed by the very funny song \\"online\\",  \\"i ' am still a guy\\" is also a great track.     His new album ties in great lyrics, great guitar riffs, fantastic musicianship all the way around, and a great singing voice for his material.    Mainly, you have to be able to identify with what he is talking about, as a guy, i know exactly what he is talking about and i enjoy the \\"silliness\\" found in most of his songs.  In closing, this album is part of a great collection that will join \\"part 2\\" and \\"time well wasted\\" in the classic albums hall of fame.
0975991477|5.0|Remember Lipton's argument: belief influences your body.  If you don't believe in certain types of alternative healing, it probably won't work.  The easy parallel case is the Placebo Effect; no one understands why it works, they only know that it happens.  The \\"effect\\" is shrouded in mystery and explained off by chemicals and electric signals.  Look into it further and you'll find that no one knows what it's caused by.    Other forms of \\"alternative medicine\\" such as acupuncture and chiropractics have been proven to work in several cases, though again, Western medicine (based off Newtonian physics) does not have a definite solution.  CNN recently published an article saying that they recommend acupuncture as a back-up to drugs and pills, because it works though not all the time.  This is due to a lack of research and understanding in the area.    I perfectly see the 3rd top reviewer's point (Anderson) and it seems  only logical that the \\"advertisement\\" at the end makes the book seem like a marketing ploy.  But once you study the science behind and the effects of Psych-K, you'll be stunned at what it can do and how it affects the body...it's not some fake program that does nothing.  Without going into details, it's an incredible utilization of the very quantum physics + medicine that Lipton discuses.    If you're a person looking for an instant solution to your problems, I firmly believe that very few books will offer that solution.  However, this is an extremely interesting read for those who wish to explore and understand medicine from an unconventional, and certainly a breakthrough, point of view.    Regards,  Student at Olin College of Engineering
1594489505|5.0|I just bought this book from a Barnes & Noble bookstore about 23 hours ago and have finished it already. It was most definitely worth the $18.17 (30% off at store) I paid for it.    If you loved KITE RUNNER, you will also be enamored by A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS. There are striking parallels: both take place in Afghanistan around the same time, both show the growth and bondage between two people, etc. However, ATSS is female-oriented and takes place completely in Afghanistan (whereas KR overflows into America).    Mariam is the illegitimate daughter of the prominent Jalil Khan but lives away from him and society with her short-tempered mother. Mariam lives for Jalil's once-a-week visits where he delights her with exotic stories and gifts. Tired of these occasional visits, Mariam attempts to truly assimilate into Jalil's family but fails. Taking that risk resulted in a series of problems that ends in her being forced to marry a shoemaker in Kabul named Rasheed. Rasheed, a widower and shoemaker, has strict, outdated values and exerts them on Mariam.    Only a few meters away from Rasheed's home is the home of a former university professor and his wife. Their youngest child, Laila is born and raised in a household that puts an emphasis on education and worldliness, a contrast to the home of Rasheed. Laila is smart and independent and doesn't hesistate to say how she feels. She enjoys a childhood of bliss with good friends and a loving family until the violence surrounding the politics of Afghanistan tear her away from her family. Surprising circumstances lead her to Mariam with whom she forms a bond of empowerment and love.    If you are going to get caught reading something at work (like I have), make it this book!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Well, a little different is an understatement. But still, look past the fact that it's Linkin Park and it's a decent album that many bands would be proud of. A major disappointment is the lack of Mike Shinoda, but Chester Bennington really comes into his own and shows off his ability to do different types of songs. It was difficult to get into the first time I heard it. A little easier the second and third, but since then I have appreciated all that's good about this record and can easily listen through the whole thing and maybe only skip 1 or 2 songs. \\"Leave Out All the Rest\\" is my personal favorite track, closely followed by \\"Valentine's Day\\" and \\"No More Sorrow\\", which is a bit more in the style of the 'old' Linkin Park, even without anything from Shinoda. 4 out of 5 simply because it isn't as bad as reviews suggest and it's still a good record, even if it is a little different.
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|Highly enjoyable.  Fun twist on the old.  Getting tired of the Disney formula (child missing one or both parent(s)disfunctional and/or ignorant  parent or family member(s) raising misunderstood child)  Love the fact that being yourelf and not conforming to the stereotypical cheerleader and jock theme is encouraged throughout the movie. The characters had depth and personality, the animation was fun, the jokes and little remarks kept the movie rolling.  Most younger kids won't get the jokes, or the references but then again kids aren't usually even paying attention to those details.  It was just fun to watch.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 2000 when I heard It's my life on the radio and I have every album that they have made so far. I recently got my copy of Lost Highway, and whether it's country or not I like it. Bon Jovi can do any music and do it good, I think.  My favourite song on this album is Till we ain't strangers anymore feat. Leann Rimes. That song has it all, it is one of the most beautiful songs Bon Jovi have ever done. And when I'm in a party mood I like to listen to We got it going on, no country there!! Just Bon Jovi rocking!   Some songs on this album may sound country to you, but it depends on what you consider to be reak country, is it Kenny Cheseny og Johnny Cash? If you think it's Mr. Cash then this album is no country..   I encourage everyone to get this album and listen to it, don't judge it just because it was recorded in Nashville.. give it a try..
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Crap on a crap cracker, this album just gets better and better when I listen to it. If this is the direction the Queens are taking themselves musically; then damn. This is what rock should sound like. From the robotic repetitiveness of the guitar riffs, to the face melting buttery smoothness of the solo's. The keyboard, drums, bass; everything is just clicking. Era Vulgaris is definitely one of my favorite albums. In my opinion this album solidifies that Queens of the Stone Age are sitting way up on the rock pedestal along with Floyd, Zep, and the Doors.
B00004THDI|1.0|I purchased this SACD after reading the glowing reviews and was disappointed when I listened to the recording. Despite being the soundtrack to a VERY LONG film, there was very little contrast in the 18 offerings on the disc. Unlike numerous classical SACDs that have greatly moved me, \\"Dances With Wolves\\" merely lulled me to sleep.
0525948023|5.0|brilliant.  essential.  probably the most important book i have ever read.
0385522401|5.0|This small book covers one wedding night yet a lifetime in just 200 pages.  It is the story of Florence and Edward who are both virgins on their wedding night in 1962.  It is oh so familiar what happens to these two people and the repurcussions of a lifetime that follows.<br /><br />It is a book that can be read in one sitting but you won't soon forget it. It touched my heart.
B000O75F7C|5.0|FOABP is, sonically and creatively, diverse and satisfying. I confess, however, upon my first listen, that I was disappointed in the overall brevity. I agree that Wilson continues to mature incredibly as a songwriter, vocalist and guitarist. His guitar phrasing is simply astounding and always elevates each song to incredible levels. Yet, somehow, the expectation that this CD would surpass the briliant \\"Deadwing\\" of 2 years ago leads me to slight disappointment and a sense of anticlimax with each repeated listen. The length and contrast of Deadwing are sorely missing. Perhaps Porcupine Tree as a band, and Steven Wilson as an unparalled songwriter of recent times, are so far apart now from the \\"rest of the pack\\" that one simply cannot come to grips with the fact that the CD must, eventually, end! Required listening for any serious proghead and music fan.
B00005JPD0|4.0|Denzel Washington always makes me want to believe in any movie he is in.  Here he plays ATF agent Doug Carlin who is brought in to investigate a ferry bombing that killed more than 500 people.  Some odd details start bothering him including the body of Caire Kuchever (played very well by the beautiful Paula Patton).  At first she looks like another victim of the blast on the ferry, but Agent Carlin notices some things that don't match up.<br /><br />Agent Pryzwarra (a nicely done turn by Val Kilmer) brings Carlin into a special investigative unit  that has a special tool to view a stream from the past.  I can't get into details of this team or much more of the movie because unraveling it is part of the fun of the film.  You know from the title of the film that it has something to do with reliving the past, but how this film does it is pretty fresh.  There is one very cool car chase that includes trying to drive in the present to keep in view the villain in a car from the past and is something I hadn't seen before.<br /><br />Yes, there are things in the plot that require artificial limits on things and require the cast to say and not say or do or not do things that would make things much more mundane and realistic, but still, as a romantic thriller, it is a pretty good entertainment.  And they do pull things together more neatly than one might expect from the early scenes.<br /><br />So, enjoy the film.  It is a pretty good way to have some fun.
B00001P4RI|4.0|It's sorta sad but understandable that 90% of the Amazon reviews center on how much this album is not like Dead Can Dance.  Admittedly the work Perry did within the DCD framework was incredible and I'm sympathetic to wanting more (at least we got a few new ones from their tour awhile back).  But no, EYE OF THE HUNTER is not in the vein of DCD, although it's very recognizably Perry. It continues his homage to the style of many of Tim Buckley's ballads (including an outright cover of I MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND).  They're gloomed up a bit more than Buckley usually did, but have the same dreamy atmosphere. Taken on it's own terms EYE OF THE HUNTER is good, not great.  Knowing what he's capable of it feels a bit lazy (especially since it's all he's released since DCD's SPIRITCHASER).  However, it's still very worthwhile and worth exploring.
B0000C8WYB|5.0|Has a very French sound to it, and Mireille really brings these songs to life.
B00006JKON|5.0|This is classic Tull. It is one of my favorite albums. Skating Away and Bungle in the Jungle were big hits, but this is one album that has multiple good songs. I can't say that about all of Tull's albums, but I can about this one.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The real life story of John Nash plays out as engaging and interesting as some of our more well thought out fiction.  Now, as some have already noted whether here or in media scrutiny, not all of this film follows Nash's life accurately.  Some of this film is fictionalized, but isn't that for the most part what always happens.  Just because it's a true story doesn't mean Hollywood doesn't feel the need to tamper.  At least here the tampering does not by any means take away from the power within the film and the performances that dominate.  Nash's life story is still portrayed effortlessly and beautifully, compelling and entertaining and full of just about every aspect of a priceless and award worthy film.  `A Beautiful Mind' truly has it all.<br /><br />Russell Crowe here delivers a breathtaking performance as John Nash, a brilliant math student who gets to the top only to tumble back down to the bottom at breakneck speed.  Living a life that in the end appears mostly a lie, Nash eventually is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  At this point in his life, married with a child and working a steady job, Nash and those around him are finding it difficult to differentiate reality from the creations of his mind.  The movie then turns its focus on Nash's recovery and the effect his sickness has on those closest to him.<br /><br />Crowe is truly the star here, swallowing whole this character driven study on the human spirit and determination to survive.  He engulfs the screen and makes this mans plight come alive for the audience.  What's commendable here is that Howard's directing and of course the script, adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography, allow for the viewer to really connect with the entire cast, most importantly Nash himself.  This proves effective because once Nash's life is shattered before our very eyes and he begins to crumble we are brought to a place deep within our emotions that would have been impossible to touch had we not come to know Nash before his world came tumbling down.  We fall in love with this man and so we feel his pain, his wife's pain and are emotionally distressed alongside them both.<br /><br />Alongside Crowe both Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany deliver astounding performances as Nash's longsuffering wife and imaginary best friend.  Jennifer's Oscar winning performance is full of so much life, so much pain and emotional attachment that we can relate to and understand her feelings every step of the way.  We watch her transform from this woman who knew how to control the things around her, including Nash, to a woman scared of what was going to happen next, a woman who felt detached from all she thought was real.  Bettany's portrayal of Nash's college roommate is high spirited and refreshing.  He serves as our brightest comic relief but also our biggest heartbreak as we watch Nash realize he never truly had his friendship at all.<br /><br />Crowe, one of our finest actors, is a true chameleon and he engages himself so far into this role that he becomes John Nash, and watching that transformation is utterly rewarding.  His determination and fervor are so invested in this performance from the moment he appears on screen that one is automatically drawn to him and connected to him entirely.  From start to finish `A Beautiful Mind' proves itself worthy of our attention and consideration and is sure to astonish and amaze you.  From its heartbreaking story to its brilliantly crafted direction to its powerhouse performances, `A Beautiful Mind' is a winner from the top of its head to the tip of its toes.  The well rounded supporting cast including the likes of Ed Harris and Josh Lucas continue to astonish in their respective roles and aid in delivering one of the warmest and beautifully articulated Hollywood experiences.

B00000AOUD|5.0|Simply a classic. This is a Tull album that will never go out of style and can be played over and over. In fact, I've done just that. I'm not an afficianado, but I know what I like. I like Tull. And I like this album.
B00004STDN|4.0|This is the third time I bought this movie ---- upgrade and give away - Still don't like the violent scene in the cave [he got what he deserved] - too real and gross.  I still chuckle at some comments - doesn't the viewers pay attention to the movie?  Gabe [Stallone] lost his best friends [Rooker] girl in the opening - he already has a thing for the female rescue pilot [Janine Turner] [if that is what she is]    Give or take - it has a lot of action - Lithgow [Erik Qualen] is an excellent maniac - it is the money or nothing.     I thoroughly enjoyed the money chase - and the slight humor involved, bunny rabbit and avalanche - the FBI? being left in the dust - they didn't seem to have any idea that their money could be stolen.  Silly guys.    I liked Gabe's apparent turn-down of Turner and then he shows up on the mountain ahead of Rooker - he may have lost his nerve but he is there for his friend [who doesn't want him there].    Great helicopter hang-up - just what Qualen deserved.  Was that the FBI to the rescue??? What slow pokes.    Definitely recommend - some extreme violence but a cliffhanger -- Featurette worth watching. [this in the Collecters Series].
B000I9W0I8|5.0|The movie is the best if it weren't for Keanu Reeves he must die the slowest and must painful death ever!!!!! Dennis Hopper's best praformenes \\"The wim of a mad man i like that\\". The acting was alright (Apart from Keanu Reeves). In some places of the movie it was so bad that it was the best part of the movie that is why i gave it 5 stars.   some thing that were bad  1. Keanu Reeves  2. It had the badest sound  3. The part at LAX  4. And the kiss at the end of the movie when everyone is taking pics.    Some good thing's about the movie.  1. Acting, apart from Keanu Reeves  2. Jack geting on the bus  3. The elevator part  4. The party with Harry drunk    In the flat end Keanu Reeves MUST DIE!!!!!!!!
B000BYA5GO|2.0|Great Acting by all who were involved -------- subject matter - violent!  Language was offensive!  Do these guys [and females] ever grow up and become more literate?  Sad to realize that this goes on in this world.  Probably a great terrorist supplier.    Based on actual facts? More than likely true.  The content is something we would like to deny - the ending, probably happens all the time.    Hate the thought that some of our government officials are that corrupt.    I got the message but can't say that I enjoyed the movie - will not keep, what a waste.
B00094ARZ0|3.0|This movie is mediocre.  Not real good, not real bad.  I watch it for the hunky Scotsman and the hunky Spaniard.  The Scotsman has a very seductive voice, and isn't bad looking; the Spaniard looks like Hugh Jackman.  The Arab sheik, forget.  One of the characters was right when they said he could pass as 'your sister' - too pretty to be a real man.      The sets were nice, the locations were fabulous.  Weak, almost non-existent plot.  The best thing for me was seeing the nude male co-stars, and I do wish there had been more emphasis on that, and also the sideline romance between the Scotsman and the Spanish woman.  Got a good laugh when the Arab sheik made a kidnapping attempt.    Just my female viewpoint.
0060935456|5.0|I have to admit, when my husband gave me this book for Christmas a few years ago, I thought, \\"Great.  A book about rabbits.  Let me get right on that.\\"  Luckily, with extra holiday time, I started the book...and was barley able to put it down.  This is one of those few books that I've encountered where the farther I got into the book, the more conflicted I became--I wanted to keep reading, but was getting distressed that I'd soon be done!  This is one of my all-time favorites.
B000OYC3J8|3.0|I think the White Stripes are very overrated and have been since they came out - phew, now that that is out of the way I can say this album is their best.  I like about one half of the album, and surprisingly it turned out to be every-other-track (not every other track on the album like, 'oh every single song except the first one' or the last one or what ever but every-other-track as in I like the first song, the third song, the fifth song, ect and dislike second song, the fourth song, sixth song, ect).  That is just an example, I actually the like the second song, the fourth song, and so on and turned out to dislike the first song, the third song, and so on and so on.  Except the pattern doesn't continue through to the final track where I ended up liking both of the last two songs.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Ok, Brad Paisley has a new CD out so, without reading any reviews, I naturally just buy it.  He's been a pleasure to listen to in the past- he's consistently enjoyable and I feel well-deserving of his recent CMA win.      Then I listened to it......  best country CD I've bought this year and I can't get enough of it!!!  Can I pick a favorite?  NO!  I think he's a genius the way his CDs are a mixture of:      *down-home fun (Ticks & Mr. Policeman)    *a brilliant look at life (Online - LOVE the Tuba and marching band!)    *beautiful ballads (Letter To Me)    *spirituals (When We All Get To Heaven)    *instrumentals (Throttleneck),     *and my beloveds: the Kung Pao Buckaroos (Bigger Fish to Fry - Brad, if you or your people read this, keep the Grand Ole Opry Theater coming!  LOVE THEM!)     My only disappointment was the duet with Carrie Underwood.  Bummer.    Thanks, Brad, for another joyous ride in Musicland!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Ok most people heared about John after cheesy ballads like your body is a wonderland. But obvioulsy this is not enough to get an overal idea about an artist ONE SONG IS NOT ENOUGH! anyway for the rest of you reading reviews about this album you probably know kid wonder a little better.Yea Kid wonder, as Buddy Guy reffered to him on an interview. John Mayer is a very gifted Blues Guitarist and continuum although is not a blues record (if you are looking for blues check the album TRIO) is his most mature work to the date.<br /><br />Very good compositions, smooth from beginning to end, good lyrics and it is so easy to listen the whole album on any given situation and I think that is a very good thing specially if you are moody with music as I am.<br /><br />I don`t trust myself(with loving you) is one of my favorite songs, very laid back with a nice mellow guitar and backing vocals to match John`s understanding of a contemporary urban song.<br /><br />Vultures is the heart of the album this song is ment to be heared over and over again it`s all about groove baby! it has a little 70`s vibe on it it`s all good!<br /><br />Slow dancing on a burning room is a beautiful ballad too.<br /><br />Get it you won`t be disspointed!
B000MCH5P4|3.0|Let me start by saying that I really like this movie a lot. I think the point is very clearly stated in the preview, but not in the movie itself, although it's clear from watching the movie. The communication barriers we all deal with, and our prejudices against one another affect our lives, and make life hard, and painful, where there does not have to be any pain, or misunderstanding.   Cate Blanchett is a phenomenal actress, and does an outstanding job here, as the wife of Brad Pitt who gets shot in Morocco while riding on a bus. She is shot by two young boys, playing with a gun, and terroristic sirens sound off throughout the world. There are some other events happening in the movie too, with their children, and the original owner of the gun who is in China. Somehow they are all intertwined which makes for a compelling story. Each having their own struggles and issues, and communication related barrier. The original owner of the rifle has a deaf-mute daughter he has trouble communicating with after her mother commits suicide. Very well done, except one major complaint.  There are some very sexually explicit scenes involving children that were pretty much unessecary in making this a great movie. I personally, think it's tragic for people to accept having scenes like this in movies, that make it somehow acceptable. It's not ground breaking, it's just violating. And, I always thinks it's a bit of a farce when this is included in a movie that otherwise would be phenomenal on it's own merit. It just seems like a weak way to include some \\"shock\\" factor, when it's not needed, and dumbs down the movie. I could care less to see that, and didn't understand it's place in the movie, except to push the envelope. That could have been done in more valuable ways. Hence, why my rating is only a 3. But, otherwise, the storyline is great, and very interesting. I like movies that have a lot of moving parts, and stories happening in many places. Definitely one you should not miss.
B000059PPN|5.0|THIS IS THE MASTERPIEACE OF LUCIO FULCI   EVERYTHING IS MARVELOUS  IT IS BLOODY  CREEPY    SCARY    AND  DISTURBING AT ALL   THE MUSIC IS FANTASTIC  WE CAN SEE THIS MOVIE  AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN    SO GOOD
B000PTYP7U|5.0|Paramore is MUCH better than most current rock bands.The first CD has had   me jumpin' and jammin' since it came out,and now there's Riot!.   I've been listening to it over and over,and just gets better every time.   Just confirms to me that this band is something very very special.   Hayley continues to raise the bar with her fantastic voice,and the rest   of the band amazes me.
B00005J6T1|5.0|When Madonna came out with her first album, I was between the ages of 7-9 years old and I thought for sure, she was going to put out one album, Be a one hit wonder and then disappear. Now, I am 34 years old, Madonna is in her late fourties, Is an actress, successful singer and well known activist.   <br />  <br />I realize now, that I was wrong. This woman is huge and this album didn't launch her career (I feel \\"Like a Virgin\\" and the movie, \\"Desperately seeking Susan\\" did) but it helped make her name known with other successful record producers and music mogels.  <br />  <br />The best cuts on this album are Lucky Star, Borderline, Burning Up (the closest thing she got to Rock and Roll before she released \\"Like a Prayer\\"), Everybody, Holiday. This album has got a mix of almost everything and It's a essential for all madonna fans.  <br />  <br />
B000002JPA|5.0|After hearing this album, just WOW.  I used to listen to most of DT's later stuff, which is quite different from this album, and thought that was the best, until I heard this.     First off, let me start off by saying it is Dream Theater's best work.  Take a look at the band members:    James LaBrie--his voice isn't tainted at all.  He hits AMAZING notes.  Check out \\"Learning to Live\\" at 7:00.  Other examples are in Another Day and Take the Time.    John Myung--a terrific bassist.  Its a shame the bass is probably the least audible in heavy metal, but boy is he good.    John Petrucci--I'm dead serious, he's arguably the best guitarist in the world, knocking Joe Satriani himself on his knees.  He can play virtually anything.  The only problem, if any, is that his style doesn't allow him to express himself and bring soul into his music.  He's a freaking machine.    Mike Portnoy--Arguably the best drummer in the world.  He can play virtually anything, but, unlike J.P., he can really bring his soul into his playing.    Kevin Moore--At this point of time in D.T. history, he is the weakest link, but that's not saying much.  The keyboards are huge in the band sound, and he plays his part well.    Ok so for the Lyrics: they are absolutely AMAZING!  Here are two examples:    Take the Time:  Just let me catch my breath...  I've heard the promises  I've seen the mistakes  I've had my fair share of tough  breaks  I need a new voice, a new law,  a new way  Take the time, reevaluate  It's time to pick up the pieces,  Go back to square one  I think it's time for a change    Learning to Live:  There was no time for pain  No energy for anger  The sightlessness of hatred  slips away    Wow, the lyrics are so poetic and....magical almost.  Amazing.    Now for each individual song, flawless in their own respect:    Pull Me Under (10/10): Lyrics are based off Hamlet.  Really neat effects to give a certain mood.  Also the creative twist at the end.    Another Day (10/10): I can't see whypeople don't like this song.  This could be LaBrie's best song.  The lyrics are about J.P.'s father's struggle with cancer.  Jazzy with the saxophone.    Take the Time (10/10): Amazing vocals, amazing lyrics.  Great show from all the band members.    Surrounded (10/10):  I'll admit, the beginning of the song threw me in a weird mood the first time I heard it.  It grows on you though.    Metropolis (10/10):  Wow, so musically dynamic and creative.  Lyrics are complicated its about a story that's hard to pick up.  Maybe the best on the album.    Under a Glass Moon (10/10): Amazing solo.  The lyrics are weird, I'm trying to figure them out, based on other DT songs, there's no way they just threw a bunch of words together.    Wait for Sleep (10/10): Moore really shines.  Great piano/singing duet.  Basically a prelude to Learning to Live.    Learning to Live (10/10):  Wow, could be the best on the album.  Great lyrics, epic portrayal of the theme, and AMAZING note hit by LaBrie. (at about 7:00)  The lyrics have something to do with AIDS.    The thing with DT is that no one song sounds just like another one of their songs.  If you listen to one don't be turned away if you don't like it, odds are you'll like one of them.      All that being said, BUY THIS SIMPLY PERFECT ALBUM!  It is the best thing that has ever happened to me in my life, and a lot of people I know, please don't miss out!
B000MV8AE0|3.0|I'm a composer. This was going to seem a little silly, unless it got it just right.  It didn't, quite.  Some of the dialog--such as B. describing his intentions as he dictates a late quartet--is painfully bad.  Also, the Diane Kruger character wasn't interesting enough to carry the movie.  The scene of her assisting in the performance of B.'s 9th looked ridiculous, except:    It was B.'s 9th.  So it made me cry.    This has an Eastern-European earthiness and also a genuine reverence for music.  So it was clunky as heck in spots, even incompetent, but sometimes moving.   Good for a laugh and a few tears if you are a musician.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I never really cared for westerns until I saw this movie. I became hooked on spaghetti westerns, and in my opinion, this is the best of them all! The storyline is certainly different, and the ending is somewhat of a surprise. The main characters really stand out: Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, Claudia Cardinale, and Henry Fonda. The music is haunting, and that was what really hooked me.
0441003257|5.0|Okay, go buy several copies of this book.    Get in your car, stop at local street intersections.     Motion to the driver next to you to roll down their window as if to ask directions.    Chuck a copy of \\"Good Omens\\" into their passenger seat before you speed away.    Repeat.
B000GFLAI0|3.0|Bob Dylan is definitely an acquired taste, especially if you're 30 or younger and wonder what all the fuss is about.   I borrowed MODERN TIMES from my local library and gave it a listen. Dylan talk-sings his way through a series of toe-tappin' blues and rockabilly songs, some fast, some slow.  Dylan's in his early sixties now, and has led a rough life. It shows up in his voice, which is raspy and croaky.  Compare this voice to octogenarian jazzman Tony Bennett, and you'll see how taking good care of one's instrument can make a big difference. Byr his manner of singing suits the material. Think of him as a poet who sings a little bit, with a really good blues band backing him up, and you'll be able to judge what he's doing here. I disagree with another reviewer below, who claims that Dylan's words are clear as a bell.  I couldn't understand him 30-40% of the time.  I think you'll need to be someone who likes old Southern blues music, to get into this album. I also think Dylan writes words just because he finds them fun to read and say, even if they don't make sense. You'll find yourself saying &#34;What is this song ABOUT?&#34;. even while you enjoy the imagery of the words. You kind of need to shift the gears of your logic into neutral.  But I like this style of music, and the band is very good.hat does that mean?\\", or \\"What is this song ABOUT?\\". even while you enjoy the imagery of the words. A 63-year-old Dylan chasing Alicia Keys up and down the hills of Tennessee? You kind of need to shift the gears of your logic into neutral.    I dislike music that uses profanity, so that turned me off to 1-2 of the songs. For me, Dylan's voice is too croaky and odd, and I find that distracting.  I guess that means I'm not a true fan.  But I like this style of music, and the band is very good.
0375507256|5.0|In his third Novel-in-Stories, \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" Mitchell proves himself to be a keen manipulator of styles and voices.  He gives us six different characters from six different eras (a sea-faring notary in the late 1800s, a bisexual composer working as an amanuensis to an aging composer in Belgium during the early 30s, a hard-boiled investigative reporter from 1975, a British vanity press publisher trapped in a 21st century rest home, a fast food clone from a dystopian, futuristic Korea, and a tribesman scrounging out a meager life on postapocalyptic Hawaii), their voices as ingrossing as they are distinct.  In some cases it takes patience and thought to decode the dialogue (the Hawaiian tale is written in an inventive, if not occasionally befuddling, dialect), but it is by all means worth the effort.<br /><br />Mitchell's gimmick here is that each story is interrupted (sometimes in mid-sentence) by the one that follows it.  The only tale that exists uncut is the sixth, which runs to its natural conclusion before passing the baton to the other five endings.  The stories could conceivably be read alone and make just as much sense, but there is also plenty of connective tissue that makes each plot relevant to the other.<br /><br />Mitchell's message here isn't new, and as far as themes go, he isn't blazing any trails.  Each tale deals with slavery and imprisonment, racism and prejudices, worlds where the will of the weak fights the stubborn odds of the strong.  Mitchell's ideology owes as much to [[ASIN:0679783393 Nietzsche]] as his craft owes to Robinson's [[ASIN:0553580078 The Years of Rice and Salt]], but his multi-faceted scope, his absolute command of the language and how it is woven into six completely different tapestries, his genius for the employment of words and meanings -- this is all refreshingly new.<br /><br />If there's anything negative to be said about the book, it's that Mitchell doesn't always trust his own skill.  He occasionally employs plot devices (the comet-shaped birthmark) that clunk across the page like cars with square tires.  And there are a few too self-referential moments for a writer who's at home in his own narrative skin.  In the second story, Robert Frobisher, the composer, is creating \\"a sextet for overlapping soloists\\" called \\"Cloud Atlas,\\" a musical masterpiece that is structured in the same manner as the book.  \\"Revolutionary or gimmicky?\\" wonders Frobisher in a passage that tries a little too hard to play for audience sympathy.<br /><br />Given the book's themes, no sympathy is needed.  Mitchell juggles the five tales so expertly and dizzyingly that they blur into one colorfully infinite loop.  And much like the loop of civilization -- as it rises and falls throughout history, borne up by breezes of bravery, defended by the status quo, brought down by choppy waves of change -- each tale has an ending that is bright but bittersweet.  It's not giving anything away to say that each character finds victory in their lives, but these moments are all microcosmic.  There's something distinctly fatalistic about the novel, as if the shoulders of the plot are perpetually bowed by the heavy weight of a world of lies, manipulation and oppression.  But the six men and women who fight under that weight bring even still the hope of glory and change -- if not universal or lasting, then at least personal, intimate, and moving.<br /><br />\\"Cloud Atlas\\" isn't just personal, intimate, and moving.  It's hilarious, dark, demanding, and dynamic.  Even if Mitchell's message is as old as the Bible, his unmistakable skill lends new credence to old words.  It's a book that lasts longer than its pages, like a sky that's too small for its clouds.ark) that clunk across the page like cars with square tires.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This wonderful movie is based on the life of Beatrix Potter, children's author and artist of \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit\\" amongst others. Spectacular acting and feel good story make for a highly recommendable cinematic experience. A must see!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Love this CD, would recommend if you like a bluesy warm romantic kind of feel.
0743496728|4.0|Jodi Picoult is one of my favorite writers - My Sister's Keeper is one of the best books I ever read. Nineteen Minutes was riveting and thought-provoking, but I agree with others who have commented on the plausibility of Alex's, even temporary, involvement in the trial being unrealistic. It reduced me to a one-sided vocal argument with the author. The bullying felt right on target. I cannot agree with those who said the popular, cool kids don't bully because they are so secure. I think it is believable that the \\"pack mentality\\" would feed into a \\"them against us\\" attitude, regardless of the status of the group. The need to belong is stonger than the need to be honorable at that age. It takes maturity to do the right thing. In spite of its flaws, Jodi drew me in as she always does. I could not put the book down, finishing it in the wee hours of the morning.
B00005K3PZ|4.0|I do not like to read great, lengthy novels that have been abridged, nor do I like to listen to great lengthy symphonies that have been cut. This is what you get with this acclaimed recording. Giulini uses the 1877[Nowak Edition]version of this most lyrical of symphonies. and subsequently too many beautiful moments are lost, particularly in the finale. [Remember, that Bruckner was greatly disturbed by the contemporary reaction to the symphony].The Schubertian elements of this lovely work are downplayed,too, making this interpretation sound like a later Bruckner work.  Sure, the orchestra playing is impressive, the conducting is impressive, and the sound quality is more than acceptable, but not as impressive.  To return to the caveat, to hear this symphony in all its glory look no further than to Tintner on Naxos. It is cheaper, has better sound, distinguished conducting, and you get to hear the whole work, as it was intended. Compare the timing: Over 71 minutes for the Tintner, and a tad over 58 for the Giulini. If you are in a hurry, then the Giulini  fits the bill. Otherwise look to Tintner.
B00003CXDG|4.0|I remember when this film was first released.  I didn't get a chance to see this film in theaters nor did I really care to.  I had seen the first M:I, and although I thought it was a fairly decent film, I didn't think it was anything to brag about.  When I saw previews for M:I-2, it really had me at confusion.  The film didn't seem to resemble anything of the first film.  While the first one was more targeted towards adults, this one was clearly aiming for a younger audience.  Naturally, I thought this movie was going to be dumb and that is exactly what I thought when I finally saw it.  I was 13 yrs old, I really did not understand anything that was going on-just something about a disease and all the action scenes that were already overplayed in the tons of commercials I saw for the movie.  After I saw it, I told everybody from that point on to ignore this one.  <br />That was back in 2001.  Its 2007 and I am now 19 yrs old.  M:I-3 has now been made which I thought was an incredibly awesome movie.  Not that long ago one of my friends and I were having a conversation about all sorts of movies.  We just happened to come accross this one.  I told him how M:I and M:I-3 were really good, and M:I-2 was bad.  He on the other hand admitted that he actually liked the 2nd one.  Seeing is how it was yrs since I saw M:I-2, I didn't really remember much except what I mentioned above.  So I started checking up on it again.  I saw the trailer on youtube and to my surprise, it looked pretty good.  Not long afterwards, the movie came on TNT.  Obviousely I watched and surprisingly enough, I enjoyed Very Much!!  While it does not live up to M:I-3, it definetly earned a spot on my favorite movies list.  Here's the plot.  <br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) is called into action when a fellow IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Douggray Scott) has gone rogue.  Ambrose has stolen a deadly biologically engineered virus known as Chimera, a virus that kills your red blood cells if infected.  There is a curecalled Valeraphon which can only save a persons if treated within 20 years.  However, after 20 hours, nothing can save.  Hunt with the help a thief, Nyah Nordaf Hall (Thandie Newton) they must infiltrate and find out what Ambrose's plans are for the virus.  Hunt must also at the same time dig deeper into discovering the truth about why this disease was created in the first place.  <br />That basically says it.  Just to add a few more things, although I actually like this movie now, I stil believe its the weakest of the M:I's.  It surprises me very much that of all of them, this was grossed the most money.  I think the real problem with this film is the very fact that it tries too hard to be \\"cool\\".  First lets start off with the ridiculous concepts- Tom Cruise rock climbing with no gear except powder for his hands, his mission being assigned through sunglasses, the car chase with Thandie Newton (there was no suspense and the characters appear to be having fun).  Then theres the action scenes.  I know John Woo has his style but I think it was a bit overdone.  Too many quick cuts and overuse of explosions.  Then theres all the rock music in the film, I do not think that was necessary.  And then there's Tom Cruise's look with the long wavy hair.  I really think his hair was like that to make this movie seem \\"cool\\".  I am sure the original M\\"I series would never have had these elements.  I really think this film would have been alot better if it were its own movie rather than an M:I.  Well anyway, I still suggest.  But if anyone has a chance, definetly check out M:I-3.  THAT ONE WAS FRIGGIN AWESOME
1400079179|1.0|If a person is at all educated about art, history, art history, religious history or the layout of Paris this book is a farce--or should be.<br /><br />People who don't know about any of the above but are taken in by the statement at the beginning of the book (something to the effect of \\"This is all true\\") and like the purple writing don't want their bubbles burst, and I don't blame them; it's hard to admit you've been taken in.<br /><br />But please, go to the library and take out any Renaissance art history book. If you can't get to the library, just Google \\"Last Supper.\\"  What do you know!!!!! __Every__ Italian Ren depiction shows John as kinda feminine looking.  This must mean all painters knew that Mary Magdelene was the One, after all.<br /><br />Look, it's not much of a secret if everyone does it, OK?<br /><br />It just means there was an artistic tradition of showing certain characters certain ways.  Since no one knew what St. Lawrence looked like, he's always above a burning grate; similarly Catherine is always depicted with her wheel, Judas is shown as a dark-haired meanie. John is shown as youngish and innocent. No one viewing the art when freshly done really believed that St. Lawrence walked around with his grate or questioned why John was young and innocent. It was all part of the personae.<br /><br />Oh, big deal, it's just a book, right?  I wish it were that simple.  I give it one star because the story is transparent, the \\"facts\\" disputable in a 2 minute Google, the characters hackneyed without being a respectful nod to fairy stories.  It's a dumb fable masquerading as a thriller and succeeds only in making trouble. What amazes me is that some people, even when shown that Paris isn't laid out that way, still believe every other \\"fact\\" presented here.
0385340559|4.0|Another satisfying Reacher novel that you've come to expect from this author. Another reviewer mentioned this, but Jack Reacher seems a little out of his normal mode. He admits he makes mistakes, (rarely making any in previous outings) and seems tamer, if only an iota. Satisfying to the very end.
0790729709|3.0|Fans of Whitney Houston will certainly enjoy this movie.  It captures her at close to her career peak and features a few of her better known hits (including her version of \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and \\"I Have Nothing\\").  Neither she nor co-star Kevin Costner fare as well on the acting end.  Since Houston later proved to be effective in WAITING TO EXHALE, I would guess that she either suffered from first film jitters or that she needed better direction--or both.  The script is generally weak and the dialogue is stilted, and there are moments when the line readings are so off, you almost wonder if the stars' first language is something other than English.  And if the mark of a good director is the ability to coax a credible performance from a child actor, then Mick Jackson's abilities could be questioned on that basis alone: the young actor playing Whitney's son is stiff and awkward.  But given his \\"mom's\\" stilted line readings, it could be viewed as some kind of genetic condition.    Amazon reviewer Jeff Shannon above jokes that Whitney's role as a show biz diva must have be a real \\"stretch\\" is clever.  But it's just possible that Whitney might have fared better with a role that was less close to her own life experience.  Getting out of high show biz mode seemed to help her performance a few years later in EXHALE, although it could also be the case that she was simply a bit more comfortable onscreen by that time.    The supporting cast is also just OK, for the most part, although many have done better work elsewhere, so you do know they can act.  Ralph Waite, as the Costner's dad doesn't have a lot to do, but he brings a certain gravitas to his small role.  Probably the only performer who gets to shine in a real emotive moment is Michele Lamar Richards who plays Whitney's sister and manager.  Even that moment may strike some as a bit overdone, but at least you know that this is an actress who can summon real tears when they're needed.      It's very easy to come awayfrom a movie like the BODYGUARD feeling like you've been manipulated, but actually, it would have been naive to expect much else.  Hollywood movies about Hollywood life have an odd tension in them.  On the one hand, they can poke a few jabs at the superficiality and the glitz of So. Cal. \\"culture,\\"  on the other hand they assume that the dream factory really is the object of fascination (and dreams) of their audience.  And maybe they're right to an extent.  But watching this movie some 15 years on, I couldn't help flashing on some of Ms Houston's subsequent career set backs and thining that this '92 film really is a sort of (inadvertant) indictment of show a biz culture that spoils and corrupts its \\"players\\" no matter how talented they are and, rather than fostering the creative process, actually works AGAINST it.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|Warner Home Entertainment has surpassed itself with this painstaking restoration of the 1933 adventure/horror classic. The movie has not looked this good in my lifetime, which only reinforces how well \\"Kong\\" stands up as entertainment after over seventy years. The groundbreaking stop-motion effects work of Willis O'Brien are on full display, and while the acting style is decidedly pre-Method, the story enthralls, and the picture moves briskly along to that immortal climax atop the Empire State Building. An early sound masterpiece from directors Merian C. Cooper (who also helped originate the story) and Ernest B. Schoedsack. This still outshines both re-makes.
B000LC55F2|5.0|A brilliant story, a stellar cast and a director with more than one ace up his sleeve.  Prestige impressed me more than many of the other more popular and critically hailed films of 2006.  The story immediately drew me in and I was constantly surprised at its twist and turns.<br /><br />Michael Caine is called on to mentor Hugh Jackman's, Angier, a role he is taking on with more and more frequency these days, i.e., most recently to Clive Owen's character in \\"Children of Men\\".  Not surprisingly, Mr. Caine lends an air of style and authenticity to the aging Magician with his true cockney accent and manner.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman does a fine job as the obsessed magician, proving that he is growing his acting chops and developing beyond the action genre of \\"X-Men\\" and fluff like \\"Kate & Leopold\\".<br /><br />David Bowie in a little-larger than cameo role is a delicious surprise.  A great showman in a film about great showman...one has to love the irony.<br /><br />Lastly, the brilliant Christian Bale continues to show he is very close to the top of that list of go-to actors.  Bale just churns out one complex and intelligent performance (\\"The Machinist\\"), while managing to stuff the box office with favorites like \\"Batman Returns\\".  I am convinced that Bale can do it al; he's that very special combination of natural talent, beguiling good looks and intelligent studied performance.  What is more amazing is he has been doing this since he was a child (giving a stellar performance in \\"Empire of the Sun\\").  His performance in The Prestige was more than Oscar-worthy, and I am sure that the golden statue will one day grace his mantle.<br /><br />This is one DVD you will want to own, because you will want to see it again and again.
B00027JYLC|5.0|Reviled and in some places banned on release, Tod Browning's horror classic is like nothing else you'll ever see-bizarre, bold, and altogether brilliant. A standard soap opera premise is elevated by the conceit of \\"normal\\" people as villains, \\"freaks\\" as heroes. Browning gets the most out of his unusual cast, mostly non-actors, and creates an eerie, chill-inducing atmosphere throughout. Don't miss that knockout climax.
B000P2A24W|5.0|One day in 1984, I bought Bon Jovi's self titled debut on cassette (yes, cassette, CD's were not out yet).  Since that day, I've purchased every CD they have released.  I feel every release had something to offer (of course, some more than others).<br /><br />Fast forward just a few years, Bon Jovi releases what is labeled a country album.  I just listened to the whole thing and I would say the country tag is not appropriate.  This album is as country as \\"Slippery When Wet\\" was a heavy metal album if you know what I mean.  Bon Jovi is a straight up rock and roll band.  They always have been.  Think about it.  There are reasons why Bon Jovi lasted through changing musical styles of the past 23 years.  The songs are great, Jon's voice is strong, and the band can play.  In short, they have talent.  And talent is what it's about - not following the next musical trend.
B00006JMQG|5.0|One of the finest achievements of the silent era and in some ways an allegory of Weimar Germany's decadent demise, Wiene's \\"Caligari\\" is an eerie, heavily stylized horror film. With its distorted angles, chiaroscuro lighting, and jarring German expressionist sets, the film is a striking precursor not only to Lang's \\"Metropolis,\\" but to the look and atmospheric feel of 1940s American noir. And its tale of a crazed doctor and his zombie-like proxy introduced a basic template for many later horror features. Still creepy and lurid after eighty-five years, \\"Caligari\\" will cast a spell on you.
0316666343|3.0|I wanted to love \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" but ultimately just thought it was so-so.  The concept is excellent, and Sebold starts off very well.  However, toward the last 1/3 or so of the book, it just got too strange to tolerate; Sebold wrote herself into a hole, really.  Far from being romantic, I found Susie's posthumous love-via-bodily possession thread disturbingly creepy.  And the ending left me wanting.  I don't think \\"The Lovely Bones\\" deserves the hype it's received.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|Howard Hawks's quintessential screwball outing remains one of our most riotous and inspired screen comedies. Grant and Hepburn (who'd do \\"The Philadelphia Story\\" two years later) are in fabulous form, with Grant wholly convincing as the nerdy, befuddled victim, and Kate on fire as a flaky but determined lass who's finally found true love, and intends to hold on, come what may. Sublime, classic film is fun, fast and oh-so-funny.
B000GPIPT2|5.0|One of the greatest horror films of all time, James Whale's \\"Frankenstein\\" veers broadly from Mary Shelley's original story while retaining its specifically tragic aspect. The ghoul-faced Karloff, without a word of dialogue here, gives a lumbering performance that is both creepy and achingly sympathetic--especially in the famous scene with a young girl (Marilyn Harris) picking a flower for him. Herman Rosse's fabulous sets and Whale's meticulous handling of atmosphere and the monster's appearance elevate this eerie study of alienation and scientific hubris far above the campier creature features that followed. Juice up your neck bolts for \\"Frankenstein.\\" Universal's reissue of this monster classic brings horror fans more background information on the making of the movie, and rare interviews with its cast. The new documentary \\"Karloff: The Gentle Monster\\" pays tribute to the actor whose forty year screen career was made by this monster. A must-see for serious Frankenphiles, and a title worthy of revisiting.
074356619X|4.0|I found this information interesting and viable.  I do recommend it, however, as a Book rather than an audio CD, as the recording has its limitations.  It was easy to lose my place and hard to find the chapter where I had left off.  Additionally, Ms. Byrne would have fared better to have hired someone to be the primary reader other than herself.  Her diction and intonations were a distraction from the message. The fact that there were many voices participating in the presentation was a plus, otherwise.  The overall information, however, was excellent and, from my experience, accurate.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I watched this with two aging race drivers: one a local dirt track champion and the other a former NASCAR Winston Cup driver.  We all loved this movie.  Besides being a high quality animated presentation, my companions pointed out the accuracy and realism regarding the racing episodes and techniques that was evident to them. This movie will be a classic!
0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan has a unique style that is not immediately apparent.  Because his stories are deceptively simple and straightforward, it is only after the final page that the true power of his writing shows its strength.  Chesil Beach, like Atonement before it, lingers in the mind weeks later with its mixture of guilt, regret, missed opportunity.  The only writers who come close to approaching this haunting quality are Grahame Swift and John Banville.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Perhaps the greatest debut in movie history, \\"Citizen Kane\\" remains one of the most influential American films of all time, thanks to the genius of Welles, who constructed this brilliant, elaborate puzzler at the tender age of 25. See it for Gregg Toland's lovely, pathbreaking deep-focus photography, Herman Mankiewicz's witty dialogue, and Welles's legendary performance as the enigmatic Kane. The film also marked the auspicious debut of several actors, including Cotten, Everett Sloane, Ruth Warrick, and Agnes Moorehead, superb as the mother who abandoned the future newspaper magnate as a boy. A peeved Hearst tried to block the film and nearly ruined Welles' career in the offing, but thankfully, art prevailed. \\"Citizen Kane\\" is a must-see.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|The first thirteen epsoides were the worse in Gilmore history with Lorelei and Luke broken up Lorelei begins dating Christopher. No matter how hard the writers tried there was nothing they could do to convince me that no matter how desperate or stupid Lorelei was that she would ever date Rory's father Christopher given all of the crappy things he's done the past six seasons and his lack of help in raising Rory or supporting her (sure he's pays for a year and half of Yale but only because his grandfather died).   Every ep. did nothing but remind me how much I hate Christopher from his \\"booty call\\" in the Long Marrow, wanting to ship Gigi off to Paris to be with her mother who abandoned her for the last two years, to him pressuring Lorelei into marrying him without even calling or consulting Rory, to reaction to Lorelei's letter for Luke to help him retain get custidy of April and to his absense when Lorelei's father was in the hospital.  With Lorelei I was torn I should hate her for all the stupid moves she made in dating and marrying Christopher but I was never able to believe for one second the Lorelei we knew for the past six years would do either given all of the things Christopher's done kept me from hating her. The Lorelei who was on the screen with Christopher with her lack of emotion or feeling in what she said or did with Christopher was not the Lorelei we've known for the past six years.   <br />There was something really off with the writing and the charactors reaction to things. Like Rory, she was correctly upset to find out her parents' elope but it wasn't the elopement that angered her but that they did it without her. Shouldn't Rory have been more angry at her parents for eloping especially given the speed of their dating and all the baggage of the last twenty-two years? That would have been interesting and might have helped the storyline be a little believable. If the writers really wanted to convince us that Christopher and Lorelei were attempting tore-try things it would have been better to A) do it earlier in the series perhaps around the time of the last Lorelei and Christopher hook up at Sookie's wedding beause at the this late in the series no one cared. Secondly had the writers were trying to really make this storyline work they could have Christopher work hard to make up for things he did in the past or his lack of involvement with Rory (with something other then money Christopher inherited. To have him and Lorelei work through these issues and him and Rory, that would have made for interesting t.v. instead of what we watched. Every time Christopher was on the t.v. everything that was good, funny and witty about Gilmore Girls was gone. Once Christopher was gone for good it was back to the normal good Gilmore Girls. Like last season Lane's storyline came to be even more welcoming from the bad Christopher-Lorelei storyline, Lane returned from her horrible honeymoon the same Lane we all knew and loved and her mother's opinion about martial relations from the same bad hoenymoon.  Her and Zack's raction to her pregnancy was funny the same goes with their fears of telling Mrs. Kim and her reaction. I loved Mrs. Kim moving in with them and Lorelei settling their fight over how to raise the twins. I loved Zack stepping into Lane's job he was the happiest man I'd ever seen in the diner business and his adopting Luke as a father figure. Other things that were good (assided from the divorce) was Lorelei helping Emily after Richard's heart attack, their drunken night together, Lorelei riding the bike and going car shopping with Luke and of course Lorelei drunkenly singing \\"I Will Always Love You\\" first to Rory and then to Luke from the moment he stepped into the bar.  Rory was likable again for the first time since she met Logan half of her storylines stinked though the whole Marty thing was completely stupided and eighth grade material the same with her two stupided new friends Lucy and Olivia. They were too stupid for me to care about or want to care about and the same with Logan. I was so happy when he was shipped of to London I secretly hoped he'd never come back but just when my dislike for Logan slipped a bit with Rory's crush on the student teacher and being there when Richard was in the hospital it ended with the crash of his internet company. Logan immediately reverted back to the same person I hated drunk, not telling Rory, hiding out from his dad and going off to Vegas with Colin and Finn. That ended it. I didn't even find Logan's proposal to Rory at all romantic and expecting her to jump at marriage at moving clear across the country to California where he had a job, where he picked out a house for them, and where he had found two newspapers for Rory to work at make it clear Logan knew nothing about his girlfriend or what she really wanted. I liked Rory's meltdown about what she was going to do after graduating in French Twist very realistic and I also liked Rory being rejected by her dream job and other newspapers very realistic, interesting, and my favorite storyline for Rory. With each rejection you could see Rory getting nervous and scared as graduation drew closer. Listening to the plans of her friends while she had none I couldn't wait to see where this was going. Glimore Girls was finally on track with Luke and Lorelei slowly making their way back to each other and Rory's uncertain future which I hopeed would contiune on in season eight. Everything was wonderful then with only two eposides left it was canceled. I was (and still am) completely blown away. I never suspected it and all the writing and words from the writers telling us fans to be patient made it clear their would be an eighth season instead after seven years of watching Gilmore Girls even though the horrors of the first thirteen epsoides of this season of waiting for Luke and Lorelei to be together it was all going to end in two epsoides. No real warning, no real tying up of the storylines andno real farewell to the Gilmore Girls. Bon Voyage was wriittened to serve as either a season finale or series finale. It was an excellent epsoide don't get me wrong. I sobbed through the whole thing from the final Friday Night Dinner to Rory and Lane's last night together, to Luke and the town throwing the surprise party, Luke staying up all night sewing tarps together it was a wonderful and touching goodbye. It did well to tie up Lorelei and Rory's storyline. But I still feel like the fans deserve more seeing Luke and Lorelei get married as it was always promised more of Lorelei working out her relationship with her parents. Too borrow from Lorelei's lines \\"I feel like I'm being ambushed\\" with the cancelation, that \\"its too soon\\" and that \\"I need more time\\" at least to have a real farewell. I'm hoping the cast and writers will come back together either for an eighth season or even a two hour Gilmore Girls to do just that to end the show properly.  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />   <br />  <br />  <br />  <br />
B000EYK4GW|5.0|Disney's fourth full length-feature (running just over one hour) remains a powerful, poignant family film, offering kids a clear and useful lesson on the virtues of tolerance. Dumbo's initial cruel treatment is still hard to watch, since we've all witnessed similar behavior. The empathy we feel for this misfit elephant only makes his ultimate triumph more satisfying. A defining classic in Disney's film legacy. Best for smaller fry.
B00005JPKE|3.0|The bit with Baron Nishi bringing his favorite horse to  Iwo which is then killed in an American air raid,is shameless hoakum.  Baron Nishi took ship to Iwo which was sunk on the way, with the loss of all his tanks.  It's said he did carry a riding crop and wear his calvary boots while at Iwo.  His horse was never at Iwo.     The letters supposedly discovered buried at Iwo has all been available to historians and interested parties for decades.      The so called music score is a sorry thing, without inspiration or relevence.    But setting these and other Hollwoodisms aside, it's watchable....
B000E41MRC|5.0|Accomplished through the offices of propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels (though he detested the idea of a woman filmmaker), Riefenstahl's magnificent, mesmerizing masterpiece offers a powerfully instructive look at the delirium of crowds, the fever pitch of 20th-century nationalist politics, and the megalomania of Adolf Hitler--none of which, of course, was its reason for being. However, on the level of technical brilliance alone, \\"Will\\" is a visual monument every bit as great--and ethically compromised--as D.W. Griffith's \\"Birth of a Nation.\\" An undeniably accomplished work of art, \\"Will\\" is one of the more intriguing documentaries you'll ever see.
B00005OC0G|3.0|Mutter's playing in the first movement is nearly enough to make one stop listening to the rest. \\"Finniky\\" and riven with \\"mannerisms\\" is one way to put it. Another would be that she simply ignores what Beethoven said as to how this should be played.  Her work in the latter movements improves to between quite good and excellent.  The Amazon review observation that the result is unmoving is right on.
B00009W0WM|5.0|No film has embedded itself more firmly in the collective imagination than this captivating, still-unparalleled romance adventure, which epitomizes everything that Hollywood filmmaking--at its very best--strives to be. Was there ever a more unlikely yet perfect pairing than the radiant Bergman and the world-weary Bogart? Portraying the twilight of civilized society in a foreign place, and the rising menace of new world evils, director Curtiz masterfully juggles tragedy and humor, intrigue and action to tell a timeless story rich in personal and political detail. And what an indelible, heart-catching finale! \\"Casablanca\\" won Oscars for Best Picture, Director, and Screenplay, and continues to mesmerize on repeat viewings.
B00003CY5J|5.0|The Score is hugely entertaining. Set in Montreal, Canada, the environs are familiar yet slightly foreign.  Robert De Niro's gentleman thief character Nick is likeable and believable.  His day job is owner of the NYC jazz club.    In a memorable scene, Nicky offers rock solid middle class advice to would be hot shot Edward Norton's character by advising him never to take longshots or high risks.  \\"Make a list of everything you want and take the next twenty years to get it.\\"  Sounds more like a stock broker than a master thief.    The Score's score is superb.  Jazzy and atmospheric.      The actual theft and escape scene is creative and well orchestrated.      Great movie with a great twist.
B000N3SS80|1.0|Empiezo en comentar que cuando salio este CD a la venta pense que con el apoyo de Marc Anthony este proyecto iba a ser un exito.  Desgraciadamente me equivoque.  Bueno, la colaboracion de Marc Anthony es evidente en las canciones seleccionadas para este CD.  Desafortunadamente la voz de JLO no tiene ese sentimiento para cantar estas canciones de amor.  Yo no se si se precipitaron al terminar este CD porque yo tengo el DVD del primer concierto de JLO que fue grabado en la Isla del encanto y la interpretacion de varias baladas por la sexy JLO fue encantadora y ahi si escuche sentimiento cuando cantaba.  Tal vez la Diva se sintio sentimental estando en Puerto Rico.  En este CD no hay una cancion que me haya hecho sentir WOW.  Pudo haber sido porque el Espanol no es la lengua principal de la JLO.  Asi que te recomiendo que escuches este CD antes de comprarlo para que no te quejes despues de haber pagado precio completo.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie is great for those who have a lot of life experience under their belt.  As a single parent, I particularly identified with the father (Will Smith) in this movie, but I know I wouldn't have \\"got it\\" and felt the emotions it evoked as deeply when I was a teenager or any time before I had kids.  I'd recommend this movie to parents, especially single parents and those who have endured hardship or poverty.
B000L22WTO|5.0|Arnold layne and Dark Globe live....performed by David Gilmour's Band along with David Bowie and Richard Wright...what's not to like?.<br /><br />I can't understand some people comments on Gilmour's right or lack of thereof to play these tunes or release this EP, or the arguments on who's the best between Roger and David, it makes no sense. Why can't David Gilmour play Syd's songs?, they were friends and he was the ONLY Floyd who tried to help him after his breakdown, he produced Syd's Dark Globe and the whole madcap laughs album, when it was already practically impossible to work with Syd because of the state he was in, so, why can't he do it?.<br /><br />I am greatfull he's doing it, at least he's bothering to, and we the fans should appreciate the opportunity to hear these songs live. I admire Roger Waters and think that Amused to Death is far better than any of the Gilmour's PF albums, but that doesn't have to do with anything. Thumbs Up to David for honoring Syd Barret, and to Rick and Bowie for helping him out.

038533558X|5.0|I like the Myron Bolitar series but as a writer, I know how the choices we make early on can come back to haunt us. The first few books were written in an almost comic style, with Big Cindi and Esperanza, and even Win deliberate stereotypes, put there to provide absurdist relief. In the last couple of books, the author has tried to depict these characters more realistically, but it's hard to make a caricature into a character.    Coben doesn't have this problem with Gone for Good. He's a better writer, a smarter writer than he used to be. Gone for Good crackles with menace and tension and the suspense barely lifts until the very last page. Maybe there's a bit too much melodrama, too many surprises, too many changes, but it all holds together. It all works.    Will Klein's brother has been framed for a murder he did not commit. Or was he? We don't really know, but we know do know that the bad guys are really bad, the good guys are not as good as they seem and our hapless hero gets crunched in the middle of the action.    Highly recommended.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|Here's my suggestion to anyone out there pondering the worth of this album: Listen to the whole thing fully at least three times.  It really grew on me after the 2nd listen- by the 3rd, I was hooked. Yes- it is not vintage Linkin Park. There are maybe two or three songs that hearken back to the old days. That slight hip-hop edge that was present in albums past definitely takes a back seat on this one. However, after listening to it a few times, you start not to miss is that much. You can tell the band is trying to stretch themselves as artist and I respect that. My true rating would be a 3.5 to 3.75. Not quite a 4, but better than a 3. For all who are undecided- but the album. Once the \\"shock and awe\\" wares off after the first listen, you'll be back in LP's corner by the 3rd.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Charlotte Bronte's novel since I was a teenager, and have seen many interpretations of the story over the years.  I did not believe it was possible for the 1983 miniseries starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke to be improved upon - but I was wrong.  This is the most involving, passionate Jane Eyre I have ever watched.  Ruth Wilson is staggeringly good - utterly believable. Initially, I thought Toby Stephens would not fit the image I had of Edward Rochester, but the nuances and intelligence he brought to the role made him the most romantic, beguiling Rochester ever.  You could feel the two characters falling in love and every step of the way it made perfect sense that they do so.  The `updated' screenplay captured the essence of the story and made it more accessible for a modern audience than any other film or television version I have seen - it was sheer perfection.  I know I will watch this DVD again and again and again.
B000002KHH|5.0|If every single C.D. in the world was to be wiped off the earth, but I was allowed to keep just one album, \\"Paranoid\\" would be that album. That's how strongly I feel about this album, and that's how utterly vital I believe this band is and how much I respect Black Sabbath. Ozzy, Tony, Geezer, and Bill were (and still are) four hard-working, blue-collar gentlemen, who appreciated a good tune and a stiff drink as much as you or I. They respected the `peace and happiness' thing that all the other bands were singing about, but they wanted the other side of life (the dark and depressing side) to make an appearance as well. Their environment and lives were shown through the music that they created (which was very misunderstood), and it definitely worked for A LOT of people. Say what you want about the band, whether you praise and exalt them or ridicule their guts out, because not one solitary person can deny Sabbath's contributions to the metal genre and their influence on every single metal band in the business...PERIOD! Since their inception, Sabbath have been creating historical and monumental work, significantly making their mark on the music industry in more ways than one could ever imagine. And what makes me sick is the so-called metal fans saying stuff like \\"oh yeah, Paranoid's an okay album, but it's just so overrated\\" or \\"sure the songs on there are {hip} enough, but they get overplayed so much it's repulsive\\". Hell, if anything, Paranoid doesn't get ENOUGH credit in our society, and about the songs being overplayed, chew on this thought. Those of you who agree with this reviewer, remember the very first time you heard Paranoid. Whether that golden year was in 1970, '80, '90, 2007, or whatever, just close your eyes and think back to the feelings you felt when this inexplicable album was spinning. The throbbing your neck endured after head banging to the title track, the raspy and sore feeling in your throat after singing along to \\"War Pigs\\", the chills and goose bumps you got when the main riff for \\"Electric Funeral\\" was underway, or how about the disappointment of having to buy new speakers after \\"Iron Man\\" blew out your old ones. Yes, all of those feelings (and many more) are why you immediately adored this album and in turn treasured it in your hearts forever. I'm here, not to urge everyone to buy this album (because if you truly love metal, then you already own this), but to restore the admiration that one should feel about this incredible album, and to reinstate the motto that Sabbath started so long ago: \\"We sold our souls for rock n roll\\"!bumps you got when the main riff for \\"Electric Funeral\\" was underway, or how about the disappointment of having to buy new speakers after \\"Iron Man\\" blew out your old ones.

0783229526|5.0|Alright its not the book, and the book is better, all his books are extraordinary, outlaw riding shotgun on the 'American Dream', but this is one of my favorite movies of all time. Johnny Depp is extraordinary, (like we don't know that), I would love to know Mr. Depp in real world friendship, he must be extraordinary to be around and have idle chit-chat with while sipping a Starbucks. I have never seen films or documentaries on Hunter S. Thompson, but I am assuming the amount of work and tireless research involved in this must have been endless and extraordinary to say the least, and I cannot stress enough, that everyone I have given this movie to, everyone from a nun, to a liberal Republican have all found it quite entertaining. Is that not what is supposed to happen when you see a film?<br /><br />Terry Gilliam was a fantastic choice for director, I do not think anyone could have brought Hunter to the screen like Gilliam, unless perhaps Depp was directing this himself. (That would have been interesting)<br /><br />Each scene is so perfectly percise and its so fluid and fluent, the drug use that is rampid and the reactions in those given situation to the people they are with and the ensuing dialouge are A+ in timing and comedic raw talent.<br /><br />I am getting goosebumps just reviewing this. Often I will have Fear and Loathing running in the background when I am perusing the net or have friends over for drinks. The countless classic lines that I will say randomly with people when a given situation arises, are just PRICELESS, and again DEPP is so brilliant, I envy his true, pure talent as an artist.<br /><br />The music is awesome, the scenes at the D.A. convention are so off-beat and satiricly ridiculous, however Del Toro and Depp still maintain their professional compusure. I really felt that I connected with this film, a lonely, star child, cross breaded dreamer, who found this gem along side a discount bin one day in my local towns grocery store.<br /><br />By far, this line in the opening scenes, just puts the whole movie on pace:  \\" We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers... Also, a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls. Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get into locked a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the ether. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of an ether binge, and I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon.\\"<br /><br />Absolutely amazing, and Johnny's voiceovers throughout the film was such a great decision to make, and I think made the film such a huge hit, because of that voiceover poetry that Hunter S.

A high-powered mutant...' is wonderfully played by Mr. Del Toro, and the chemistry between Gonzo and Depp is sensational. The takes and abundant laughs that must have been part of each and every day on this film, must have been memories that will last a lifetime.<br /><br />To hell with the purist on this one, buy it and add it to your collection.  Not a five star film in comparison to films like Dead Poet's Society or Empire of the Sun, but certainly a five star in the talent department and entertainment field, and for that in itself, I will give it 4.5.<br /><br />\\"I Fear Nothing.\\"<br /><br />Kenjust puts the whole movie on pace:  \\" We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, laughers, screamers...

B000002WYT|5.0|Despite the fact that I am writing an online review for a DMB album that isn't their best, I am still writing this to show that \\"Crash\\" is definatly \\"one of their best\\".      When Dave Matthews first started this band in the very early 90's, he noted that he did not know how successful DMB would be.  They soon ignited a revolution in music consisting of solid rock mixed with jazz that appealed to different fan bases.  Crash is an album that would appeal to the typical listener, and it would give goosebumps to those who really consider DMB to be one of their favorite bands.    In \\"Two Step\\", you really get introduced to DMB's tendancy to plod around and jam for 6+ minutes.  It really is a nice feel when you listen to it.  The third track off this album is \\"Crash into Me\\", which is their most successful single.  \\"#41\\" is definatly a song to listen to.  Because the song has such a catchy introduction, the listener instantly get's engulfed and is soon satisfied after its 6:39 running.      \\"Lie in Our Graves\\" is possibly their best song off this album.  The story to this song is so subtle, yet you know everything when it ends.  It simply talks about the story of a boy who is born, grows up, and eventually see's his friends and loved ones die off as he is there to stay.  Because this song is better when heard live, I can't say that the middle jam is \\"gold\\".  I'd probably have to say its \\"great\\".  Because most of their live versions of this song clock in around 12 minutes, this 5:42 version isn't as packed, but it definatly is a piece of art.      \\"Proudest Monkey\\" is perhaps the most unique song on the album, because of its telling story.  It is also a 9 minute plod of jamming that are very well expressed by Dave, Boyd, Stefan, Carter, and Leroi.      This album wasn't at all a \\"crash\\" as far as sophmore albums go.  In fact, it was one of their greatest they've released.  This album would definatly appeal to new fans, and it would give true fans goosebumps everytime theyhear it.

It is also the album that comes closest to being what Elton was about in his grandest. Extravagant, over-the-top, melodic and brash, this double album is probably how many from the period would describe both the album and the performer.

Elton's reputation as a showman had already become the stuff of legend, and in the feverish time of the seventies, he allowed that into the \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" artowrk. The original album was a thing of ornate beauty, a triple-fold gate sleeve that expanded out to show Elton stepping into a magic kingdom in ruby red platform shoes. The inner-sleeves were decorated with illustrations for each lyric and the band photos. It was everything you wanted in an album at the time...the full experience. Something you really don't get from too many performers these days.

There was the beautiful, melodic piano work on the title track and \\"Candle In The Wind,\\" the hard rocking \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" and \\"Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting,\\" the western looking \\"Social Disease\\" and the melodrama in \\"I've seen that movie too\\" and \\"Harmony.\\" Seventeen near flawless songs over two albums, and that was following the breakthrough of \\"[[ASIN:B000001EG2 Don't Shoot Me I'm Only the Piano Player]]\\" and the number one \\"Crocodile Rock\\" from earlier that same year.<br /><br />It wasn't just the seeming effortlessness to Elton and Bernie's prolific pace that was so attractive, it was the extravagance. Elton's reputation as a showman had already become the stuff of legend, and in the feverish time of the seventies, he allowed that into the \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" artwork. The original album was a thing of ornate beauty, a triple-fold gate sleeve that expanded out to show Elton stepping into a magic kingdom in ruby red platform shoes. The inner-sleeves were decorated with illustrations for each lyric and the band photos. It was everything you wanted in an album at the time...the full experience. Something you really don't get from too many performers these days.<br /><br />That is one of the many bonuses of this Deluxe version of \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\" The album art is faithfully reproduced, plus you get reproductions of some of Bernie's typed lyric sheets with correction and the faces of the mastertape labels. I have to admit that I don't care about - or for - the extra B-sides, as they distract from the original album's structure, are all available elsewhere and aren't very good songs. (The exception being acoustic \\"Candle In The Wind.\\") Another nice touch is the \\"tribute to the genius of Gus Dudgeon.\\"<br /><br />As such, the deluxe \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is as good as gold, and worth the extra bills.

0465092756|5.0|\\"Not Even Wrong\\".  This phrase originates with Pauli, who applied it scathingly to any theory that had to be taken on faith because it was not falsifiable by experiment.  Peter Woit employs the phrase to describe supersymmetric string theory, which is currently all the rage.  Fighting words indeed!    I'm a qualified theoretical physicist, no longer practicing.  For many years, I heartily supported the efforts of string theorists to achieve either a further illumination of the standard model or a synthesis of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  I am sad that they have really achieved neither.  Perhaps one day they will achieve something.  I still wish them every success.    But the string community (or any other scientific group) cannot be allowed to turn their chosen approach into a fad, a cult, a religion or - worst - an inquisition.  That might be sociologically amusing if it weren't so pernicious for physics and physicists.  The effect is that physics departments become the monopoly of self-perpetuating, self-congratulating clans of homogenous thinkers.  (Lee Smolin uses the psychological term \\"groupthink\\".)  Young physicists are informed that string theory \\"is the only game in town\\".  Sign up for it or go away.    Historically, scientists have countered our natural human hubris to believe whatever we think in two ways.  One is by challenges from fellow scientists, who invent new theories, at odds in large or small ways with the standard thinking.  The other is by nature, whose measured phenomena often contradict established theories.  Of course, in the physical sciences, experimental evidence always holds the trump card over human speculation.    String theory is currently in an unfortunate place.  There is no imminent experiment that could bring it into contest with nature.  And, because of the iron curtain within which the string community seems to have walled itself, there is little contact between the adherents of string theory and their potential human challengers.  Woit's book opens a channel of dissent, which can only be healthy for physics, both as a science and as an academic career.    In summary then, this book makes strong points about the current \\"unscientific\\" state of string theory, ones that need to be publicly and vociferously stated.  Woit speaks out firmly and professionally, with specific, well-reasoned arguments and some occasional passion.      To point out that an emperor has no clothes takes no courage for a small, innocent child.  However, it takes bravery for a professional to point out the same thing, with full knowledge of the impact that his iconoclasm might have.  I admire Woit for standing up in print for what he believes.    Of course, like any scientist, Woit may be right or wrong.  Time will tell.  But it is chilling that, because his book challenged the entrenched orthodoxy, Woit had such difficulty in getting it published,.  That fact alone, ironically, means that the book's publication is most timely indeed.  And I very much enjoyed reading it.
B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I watched this 1956 John Ford classic for the first time the night after watching the 10th aniversary of afi's 100 years 100 greatest movies show.  I have a runco front projector and a 106\\" drop down screen even an image stretched that much it looked amazing on Hd, so bright and colorful.  Ive seen older movies in HD via cable and through dish (voom when it was around) and they do not compare to a movie on hd dvd, i own about 30 Hd dvd titles so far and believe it or not this would rank as one of the best looking ones.  I believe older titles and silent films restored like this in amazing transfers and becoming available on dvd, hd dvd and blu ray are big reasons that there were 19 new slots on the afi list that did not make it last time and only three movies kept there original rankings.  Another example a beautiful movie like city lights jumps from 76 to 11 and Vertigo  from 61 to 9.  What can i say about a movie like this that hasn't already been said, i've read reviews from Ebert and interviews with Scorsese and found it interesting that Taxi driver was influenced a great deal by the Searchers.  Ethan pursues his niece Debbie, obsessed and determined to save her from the commanche indians.  In Taxi driver Travis Bickle also tries to save a young Jody Foster about the same age as Debbie from a pimp.  It is not certain either girl wants to be saved in both films, and the pimp in Scorsese's film played by Harvey Keitel wears an indian feather in his hat.  This is a great add to any collection and a great looking and sounding dvd for any time period.

Her father works hard on the farm, trying to keep them afloat. But even he has a hard time dealing the losses that they are faced with. And Bobo herself feels responsible for the death of her sister, Olivia. But through it all, Fuller does a great job of projecting her love for her family and for Africa, her home.

B000S0DDG0|2.0|I did like the music - although nothing about this film compares to Chicago in terms of score, acting, depth or cinematography. The racial agenda was pretty blatant.  I guess it should be expected. It must be a standard requirement in Black films - all White and Asian are either thieves, awkward & dull idiots, or mean victimizers. It's a cultural motif that no adult (at least any thinking adult) buys.

It follows female protagonists from the Soviet days of Afghanistan to current times.  The characters are believable and the trials of these women truly amazing.  If it isn't yet in your summer reading stack, I recommend it thoroughly!  I am also glad that I had read Reading Lolita in Tehran and then Greg Morgensten's Three Cups of Tea:  One Man's Mission to Promote Peace One School at a Time (building schools for Afghan girls).  I think I have a much deeper understanding of that part of the world.  Next in my stack of to be read books is Infidel

B00003CX5P|3.0|STAR WARS EPISODE I: THE PHANTOM MENACE would have had to have been beyond perfect to survive the almost twenty years of fan anticipation and the avalanche of hype it was met with. When released in 1999, reactions to THE PHANTOM MENACE were very mixed. Disappointed (even embittered) fans claimed that George Lucas had created THE PHANTOM MENACE merely to cash in on the STAR WARS franchise---as if he needed to \\"cash in\\" on what had already become a multibillion dollar enterprise. As a result, the whole \\"prequel\\" trilogy got a bad reputation, none worse than this film.<br /><br />Revisiting it years later, after all the shouting has died down, THE PHANTOM MENACE seems far better than it did upon its release. It doesn't measure up to any of the films of the original trilogy. It may in fact be the weakest film of the sextet. THE PHANTOM MENACE suffers from the same mistaken approach that George Lucas has adopted toward his \\"improved\\" versions of the original films. THE PHANTOM MENACE has most of the same shortcomings, particularly the (very common) sci-fi bugaboo of using a film to showcase special effects. Lucas gave us a truly Shakespearean tale in the first trilogy, and incidentally set it \\"a long, long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.\\" The spaceships, the ray guns, and the alien life forms propelled the story, but they were NOT the story.<br /><br />Lucas wants to show us all kinds of new, colorful, and beautiful visions in THE PHANTOM MENACE, and he does, but at great expense to the storyline, which meanders all the way from Point A to Point A Prime in this installment.<br /><br />There's even greater expense to the characterizations. We could relate to Luke, Leia, Han, See Threepio and Artoo Detoo in the first trilogy because they were like us in so many ways. Han Solo especially served to ground the STAR WARS universe in familiarity. Han's \\"scoundrel\\" energy was very central to the success of the original movies.<br /><br />There isn't a lovable scoundrel in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Lucas does give us some truly interesting new characters, but they're alien (both literally and figuratively) and we hardly get to know them.<br /><br />The young Queen of Naboo, Padme Amidala (played by Natalie Portman, one of the beautiful new visions in this film) is oft-times regally remote, and somewhat mysterious. Her lookalike decoy is played by Keira Knightley (another beautiful new vision), and it is truly difficult to tell them apart at times.<br /><br />Although Portman's Amidala shows herself to be clearly a warm, open, and sympathetic character, by the end of THE PHANTOM MENACE we know much less about her than we do about her cinematic daughter, Princess Leia, in A NEW HOPE.<br /><br />Young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) is a slave-child on Tatooine. An inventor and a gifted pilot even at the age of eight, he is so bright-eyed and kindhearted (\\"Someday, I'll come back here and free all the slaves\\") that it is difficult to reconcile this gentle little boy who cries for his mother with the horrific Darth Vader he eventually becomes.<br /><br />The Jedi Council initially refuses to allow Anakin to be trained as a Jedi (\\"There is much fear in you, young one,\\" says Yoda). We never really see his fear or feel it. Nor do we get much more than a glimmer of the rage and anger he must feel as a slave. Watto, his owner, is a straw boater wearing, comical-looking flying bumblebee/vulture who speaks with a vaudeville Italian accent. Simon Legree should not be doing stand-up. By making Watto a figure of fun, Lucas fails to either underscore the weaknesses of the Galactic Republic, or presage its descent into darkness.<br /><br />Essentially, we have only the criticisms of the Jedi Masters to go on in consigning young Anakin to the Minus Column. It just isn't enough, especially when he wins the high stakes podrace that is the main act of the story (the stakes being his own freedom), and is eventually responsible for firing the well-placed shot thatdefeats the enemy in battle (like his cinematic son, Luke).<br /><br />The oddly mismatched love between the prepubescent Anakin and the much older teenaged Padme comes out of nowhere, with hardly a forethought (Anakin's shy question to the girl at their first meeting---\\"Are you an angel?\\"---is the only indicator of what later blossoms).<br /><br />Likewise, Lucas utterly wastes two of his most intriguing characters, the iconoclastic Jedi, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the truly satanic Darth Maul. Qui-Gon is wise. Qui-Gon is skilled. Qui-Gon should have been Obi-Wan's Obi-Wan and Anakin's ally. But although Qui-Gon is instrumental in freeing Anakin from bondage, he never develops a truly affectionate (Obi-Wan and Luke-type) relationship with the boy, seeming more interested in him as raw material for Jedi training.<br /><br />The silent Darth Maul, (the evil lord of shopping centers) with his horned black-and-red face, twin-ended lightsaber, glowing sulfur-yellow eyes, kendo-style fighting technique, and flowing black robes is potentially a figure as memorable and frightening as Darth Vader, but both he and Qui-Gon die in battling one another; and so a fascinating second trilogy dynamic between good and evil dies with them.<br /><br />Added to these missed opportunities are odd inconsistencies between THE PHANTOM MENACE and the original trilogy. See Threepio turns out to have been built by Anakin on Tatooine, but then why didn't the droid recognize Tatooine or the name \\"Skywalker\\" in A NEW HOPE? Although Ben Kenobi claims to have been trained by Yoda in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, he is clearly Qui-Gon's student in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Tatooine is ruled by the Hutts in this film, but not in the original trilogy. Although Anakin's mother references Tatooine's twin suns, they're never seen together in the sky.<br /><br />Clearly, Lucas couldn't have reworked the original films after 20 years to fit all these elements in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Their inclusion here is a sign of his hubris. Why not just be true to the original? Clearly, his desire to make these changes overrode any considerations of film continuity and audience expectations. George Lucas isn't really trying to give us a better cinematic experience here, he's just totally into playing with his favorite toys. It's a form of selfishness.<br /><br />Possibly the worst of Lucas's new ideas is the Social Darwinist/Nazi race theory concept of a high \\"midichlorian\\" count giving rise to greater Force sensitivity. Anakin has a mythic virgin birth due to the midichlorians, a bad twist to the tale when one considers that Lucas could have underscored the horrors of slavery by having Anakin fathered by a freeborn man who exploited Shmi Skywalker's position as a slave. Here, once again, the film fails to foreshadow the lawlessness and unethical evils of the rising Galactic Empire.<br /><br />STAR WARS isn't sociology, but it's insistence on touching universal themes is what made it so wildly successful. The first trilogy was constructed entirely upon the foundation of our shared collective subconscious. Lucas loses that thread in this film.<br /><br />The inclusion of the midichlorian factor means that the Jedi are no longer a highly-trained spiritual fraternity. They've become racially superior to the rest of us. If ever he re-edits THE PHANTOM MENACE, the midichlorians must end up on the cutting room floor. Sorry, but as ideas go, this one just stinks.<br /><br />And speaking of stinks, Lucas also brought us the ridiculous Jar-Jar Binks and his race of Rastafari amphibians, the Gungans (Ganja, anyone?). Jar-Jar Binks is a technically interesting additional character, being primarily a CGI character; but he adds nothing (and detracts much) from the film with his distracting brainless chatter, clumsiness, and utter stupidity. If Lucas thought that this duckbilled dunce would provide comic relief, he was wrong. See Threepio and Artoo Detoo serve that purpose in the first trilogy and should have continued to do so in THE PHANTOM MENACE. Jar-Jar merely irritates the viewer, particularly given that he appears throughout the film, not just in a few scenes. He's merely filler. As filler, he's a sign that Lucas wasn't imaginative enough to use THE PHANTOM MENACE's screen time to its best advantage by progressing the storyline.<br /><br />Binks may be the only character ever that inspired a website advocating his destruction, the aptly-named [...] What was George Lucas thinking when he gave us the jarring Jar-Jar?<br /><br />THE PHANTOM MENANCE is uneven and inconsistent and suffers from some poor scriptwriting and too many missed opportunities.

B000NVT0RU|3.0|The movie is incoherent. The acting is stiff, not convincing.   There are two touching scenes in the whole DVD. One is where an Algerian soldier stepped on a case of fresh tomatoes and said to his French captain  \\"If tomatoes are not given to everybody, then nobody will get one\\".   The second is where another Algerian soldier rushed to a room and tried to carry his wounded French captain away from the house while the Germans were entering it. They ended up being killed by the German anti-tank gun. Had the soldier just run away by himself and left his commander behind, he would have had escaped death.  The film is good in term of anti-racism. It is worth renting not buying.   Saving Private Ryan, Band of Brothers, the Longest Day, the Lost Battalion, Hamburger Hill, We were Soldiers, Gettysburg and Gods and Generals are still the only titles on my list of Best War Movies of All Times.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Best-selling author, Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), is struggling with her newest novel. How will she kill the main character, Harold Crick? Little does she know, Harold Crick (Will Ferrell) is real and she is writing his life story. Harold has been hearing her voice in his head as she narrates every moment of his mundane life as an IRS agent. Harold seeks out help from a professor of literature (Dustin Hoffman), and together they try to figure out who the voice is and what it means for Harold's future.     This is admittedly a very \\"out-there\\" concept, but amazingly it works. The acting is superb and this is one of Ferrell's strongest performances. Ferrell is more notably recognized for his slap-stick comedies and quirky characters, but here he shows he can also be serious and charming. The supporting cast of Emma Thompson, Dustin Hoffman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Queen Latifah add a clever dose of richness to an already engaging performance by Ferrell.     This is a fun film that beautifully explores the human psyche and the beauty of literature. Not only is this film entertaining, but it is also extremely thought provoking. Harold Crick struggles with a universal question: what will we do with the life we each have been given? Are we led by fate or do we have a choice in regards to our destiny? In the end, the answers Harold Crick discovers and the choices he makes will warm your heart and open your eyes.
0061015725|2.0|It seems this book begins the decline in Crichton novels. It's not a very good SciFi adventure. I've read a few of his books and have enjoyed them in the past, but based on this one's merits and looking at State of Fear and Next, I doubt if I'll ever read a Crichton book again.

1594200823|5.0|I'm posting this to strongly encourage all journalists (I'm a former journalist; 20 years in the business) and all writers to evaluate this book because of how well Micahel Pollan analyzes a topic and then writes about it. The writing is sharp, witty, and inspiring. But the writing begins with the thinking process, the way in which he breaks down something that's fairly obvious in our lives (say, the idea of the big grocery store) and looks at the components underneath. Pollan moves seamlessly from gritty first-person journalism and scientific details to breezy (easy to read) essay writing that reveals how he builds his arguments. Quite simply, this is one of the best pieces of non-fiction I've ever...devoured. I read \\"Fast Food Nation\\" but this takes some of those basic facts and branches off and puts forward a much more complex evaluation of all that lies behind the eating problems in this country today. In particular, I found Pollan's point that we have no single national food culture to be particularly compelling. What a book.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|After the very good but somewhat experimental Octavarium, I expected Systematic Chaos to be powerful, heavy and \\"direct\\" like the awesome Train Of Thought. The album title and cover seemed to confirm it. But guess what? SC went to the other way and unfortunately it went bad.    A lot of the songs are DT long, but they are softer and lack puch. It looks like they went from prog metal to prog rock.  Besides they are somewhat repetitive, taking forever to end. Change of Seasons' 23 minutes seems short in comparison to Repentance, for example.    Not that SC does not have its good moments. It does on the shorter songs. Forsaken is very catchy, leaning heavily on LaBrie's vocals, could be described as a medley of Pull Me Under and Take The Pain. Constant Motion is heavy like Glass Prison, As I Am and Root Of All Evil, just a little more modern, and a good chorus. And Dark Eternal Night is DT's tribute to Pantera, groovy and absurdly heavy guitars, Phil Anselmo-like duet between LaBrie and Portnoy, mixed with LaBrie's typical chorus, and in the solo each instrument seems to chaoticly go in a different direction, but surprisingly together. Also, Portnoy is singing more in the whole album, adding some nuances to DT's sound. Finally, if the whole album was heavy, I would consider Ministry Of Lost Souls and In Presence part 2 as good songs, breaking the pace with lots of feeling, but here they just look like the 7th and 8th inning of a lousy baseball game.    In Presence part 1 starts reasonably well, but LaBrie takes forever to start singing and somehow his voice seems to be covered by the instruments, just like someone singing during a NASCAR race. Repentance follows the Glass Prison - Dying Sool - Root Of All Evil alcohol trilogy, but it's slow, boring, like a hangover. Prophets Of War tries to be modern, but its pseudo industrial riff and melodies seems the same all throughout the song.    In short, SC has some good songs and the special edition cover is almost worth thealbum, so beautiful it is. But it's DT's worst album and not a promising sign. Download some songs and let's pray for more chaos next time.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|This less-than-2-hour movie aired on PBS with a great intro by host Russell Baker.  The dvd is a good rendering but sound could be better.   Anne is the younger, unappreciated daughter of a shallow aristocrat who has squandered his money and has to move to Bath in order to live cheaply.  The story revolves around this situation and his daughters' love interests, as well as the famous trip to Lyme.  Anne's old love, Captain Wentworth, proposed to her years ago, but she refused him on advice of a close family friend who thought he was too poor.  Now the shoe is on the other foot.  He reappears, wealthy and sought after, seeming to have forgotten Anne.  He leads everyone to believe he plans to marry Anne's sister-in-law.  In the 8 years since refusing him, Anne has become strong enough to go after what she wants, but her family and a new man on the scene make that difficult.  The last few minutes of the film are some of the most romantic ever made.  Warning:  don't watch this with anyone who would laugh at the Austen-era language. It will ruin the experience for you.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|A really good original idea, children of men is a cool glimpse at a hopeless future in a very new sort of way.    It does fall short of being a great movie however, since it doesn't explain itself. You know whats happening, but you don't know why. I'm very tempted to read the book because with a story this interesting, it seems that it's missing a lot of vital aspects that would probably be better suited for a book anyway.    I did like the plot however, it was a good idea just not as clear as it should've been. I really liked the way that they portrayed a future of strictly adults. The city had a real run down look to it. why should they care about the future when there won't be one? so they just sort of let things fall apart. I also really liked that the directed opted for long shots. Most of the scenes are done in one shot without any cuts, and it must've been really had to do. It does however give the film a very free flowing feel which I liked a lot.    Worth watching if you're into 1984 and equilibrium type movies.
0385522401|5.0|Ian McEwan's \\"On Chesil Beach\\" is a dimunitive masterpiece. In his last novel, \\"Saturday,\\" McEwan confined his plot to a single, momentous day in the lives of his characters. \\"On Chesil Beach\\" further pares down the plot timeline to a couple of hours that forever change the lives of two newlyweds, Edward and Florence, on their wedding night, on the verge of -- but not quite in the midst of -- the sexual revolution of the 1960s.    I'll admit to being quite a fan of Mr. McEwan's fiction. I've read nearly everything that he has written (at least everything that I could get my hands on), starting with \\"Atonement,\\" which ranks among my all-time favorite novels, and working back through his catalogue. He is, in short, one of the finest novelists writing today. His prose is elegant and graceful, but never mannered or obtrusive. His writing is wonderfully transparent; he is a virtuosic stylist, but never draws attention to his artistry. The text flows with such supple and natural ease that every  word seems both necessary and inevitable. He writes with great economy, but is never cryptic or obtuse.    His plots often spin out from, or in towards, a single, defining moment in the lives of his complex and fully wrought characters. The power of a simple gesture, a facial expression, a few words carelessly spoken or withheld to alter intricately entwined fates is gradually, tantalizingly revealed. To surround and support this central event, he seamlessly weaves in asides and flashbacks that both flesh out his characters and firmly establish the era of which he writes. He deftly introduces issues of class, gender, politics and history, and he focuses on the conflicting motivations and emotions that we all must deal with, both individually and in society with one another. In the case of Edward and Florence, the two young lovers are trapped by their inability to communicate, and torn between genuine, self-giving love for each other and the equally compelling selfish desire to maintain appearances. It is a great tribute to his considerable skills at characterization that the reader ends up endorsing, and condemning, both characters in equal measure. We appreciate and applaud the noble sentiments and actions of both Edward and Florence; we understand and commiserate with their all-too human foibles.

0316067598|5.0|Apparently some people are upset because Luttrell has an opinion and some attitude.  I'll let you in on a little known secret...one does not survive any severe challenge without strong opinions and attitude.  It is part of the man, therefore a required part of \\"his\\" story.  Even if you still have your John Kerry bumper sticker still super-glued to your car and you truly believe in the vast right-wing conspiracy, you should buy this book for what it is, an amazing (and true) story and a great read.  Stop pushing the liberal or conservative agenda for awhile and just be an appreciative American.  Luttrell is the real deal.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This documentary really cuts to the truth of the matter about global warming without playing to our emotions. It is very fact based and the facts are given in a way that is very straight forward for the average person to easily and readily digest and understand.    Global warming and climate changes are a GLOBAL ISSUE. It is everyone's issue who lives on planet Earth. Global warming and climate changes AREN'T ABOUT POLITICS OR WHETHER YOU LIKE AL GORE OR NOT, it is about making the the necessary changes to our current way of life AND making the world a better place to live for ourselves and future generations. Otherwise we won't have a viable place to live in the vary near future. Change can be simple. It all starts with each of us.
B00005JPFF|5.0|Unpredictable, that a good thing. Funny, thats a good thing. Action and characterization, more good things. Good direction, the coolest special effects ever, what is the problem? I will never understand the mentality of other viewers I guess.
1591391105|5.0|As a human resources professional, I have seen a great deal of management transition.  Many succeed but some do not.  Unfortunately for our people and our organizations those that do not leave a stream of damage in their wake.    Recently I wrote a review about Scott Eblin's, \\"The Next Level\\" and I called it a real disappointment.  This book is not and it is a far more actionable and practical approach to managing transitions.    One of the reasons this book is so practical is that each section not only provides you with clear direction but each section also ends with an action checklist.  This make creating a 90-day transition plan doable and improves your prospects for success.    Lastly, the steps from this book create a framework that a company can use to create a \\"transition strategy\\" for all its new and upwardly moving managers.  This alone will enable a firm to increase their odds that a new hire or promotion will be in the \\"win\\" column.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I own every White Stripes cd. Each one that I have, I think of in a different way and when I get in the mood to listen to the White Stripes, I get in a mood for a specific cd. I don't always like every single song on the cd and this one is no different. However, the songs I do like usually make up for the ones I could give or take. If everything they released was exactly alike, I doubt I'd give them as much credit. What I find though is that the songs that I'm not fond of when listening at home are the songs that I begin to love when I see them played live.     This cd is light-hearted to me. There aren't as many crushing riffs as previous releases. I love a band that is progressive in its exploration of art, whether its influences are more retro or it is aiming at a futuristic sound. It is definately worth picking up if at you ever at any point liked anything the White Stripes released.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|This record is great, just great.  It's creative, both lyrically and musically.  It's interesting and it's the Stripes' smartest record yet.  The songs are funny and scary at the same time.  The best blues record you've ever heard.
1582701709|5.0|I've listened to the CDs and read the book.  It is absolutely on point! People that criticize the book may have expected some magically formula or portion as \\"The Secret\\".  But in essence \\"The Secret\\" is stating that whatever is in your subconsciousnes will manifest in your life.  Not only does it state to change your subconsciousness, it also states HOW to do it...which most self-help books leave out.  GREAT INFORMATION!!  (I enjoyed the CDs better than the book.)
B000PFUAO6|4.0|This is my first review on Amazon.  I'm a pretty big DT fan.  I've listened to all of their albums multiple times and even like Falling into Infinity.  Having said that, this is right up there.  Not quite as heavy as Train of Thought.  Lyrics are darker than Octavarium.  No over the top effects or anything.  Just a cleanly produced cd with solid songs by one of the best bands today.  Highlights are In the Presence of Enemys Pt 1 & 2, Ministry of Lost Souls, and Constant Motion.  Worth Buying.
B000007638|5.0|Wings Over America (1976) was originally released as a triple album, went to number one on the charts, and is the crowning glory of Paul McCartney's post-Beatles band, Wings (they released two more albums, then folded).<br /><br />This version of Wings includes includes Paul, Linda, Denny Laine, Jimmy McCulloch, and Joe English. Paul has said this was the best Wings lineup of them all.<br /><br />The album includes 28 songs on 2 discs, and you pretty much get the best of Wings, plus 5 Beatles songs. All sound great, and most are true to the studio versions. The biggest treat is this fantastic version of Maybe I'm Amazed. This is the best ever recording of the song, and it rocks!<br /><br />Speaking of rocking, there is plenty of that to be found here, too. If you thought Wings was only all about silly love songs, you're in for a nice surprise.<br /><br />Right from the start, with Venus And Mars/Rock show and then Jet, they come out rocking. Let Me Roll It and Medicine Jar rock, too, then Call Me Back Again features some of McCartney's legendary throat-shredding vocals (think Oh! Darling). It sounds 10x better here than the studio version on V&M. The Long And Winding Road and Live And Let Die sound very good here, too.<br /><br />Wings does an nice acoustic set of 5 songs, including Blackbird, Bluebird, I've Just Seen A Face and, of course, Yesterday, which sounds great and brings the house down as usual.<br /><br />Denny Laine sings Go Now, a song from his days with The Moody Blues, with backing vocals from Paul and the rest of the band, and it sounds good.<br /><br />Then they all run through Wings' hits, My Love, Listen To What The Man Said, Let 'Em In, Silly Love Songs, and Band On The Run. Every one sounds great, and some even sound better than the studio versions.<br /><br />Time To Hide, Beware My Love, Letting Go, Hi, Hi, Hi, and Soily are all wide open rockers, and believe me, this band can rock. With McCartney and guitar whiz-kid Jimmy McColloch leading the way, Wings rips right through these songs, rocking like they really mean it! Great stuff.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Wings, and their very special place in rock history, Wings Over America is essential. It's great music all the way through, and a performance documentary of a time when Paul McCartney and Wings were on top of the world, as they were setting attendance records in the stadiums and arenas across America.e they really mean it!

B00005JKG9|2.0|I am a huge Al Pacino fan, but honestly, this film bored me.  I did not enjoy any aspect of it and would not recommend it  to anyone.  I am surprised so many others enjoyed it.  This is the only Al Pacino film I did not enjoy.
B000GLZJNQ|5.0|This is probably the most important book I have ever read. This book teaches you lessons of life in every chapter, straight from the mouth of a man who must have been heaven sent. Lessons that seem so simple, but in reality can change your life entirely. In his deteriorating physical state, he is able to give so much to those around him, he is able to put aside the heartbreakingly cruelty of what ALS is, so that he may contribute to other people's quality of life. My father passed away 15 months after his diagnosis of ALS, and I lived through every single detailed deterioration that Morrie described from his experience with the disease in this book, I lived through it personally. It is very, very hard to remain optimistic when you or a loved one has this relentlessly cruel cruel disease. Morrie was able to accomplish this, and Mitch Albom is able to deliver this information in such a loving, touching, heartfelt manner. I laughed, I cried, sometimes I had to stop and put it down and reflect on the \\"lesson\\" being taught.  I recommend this book and I treasure it, I have started reading it for the 2nd time. Morrie Schwartz, after my father, You Are My Hero!!

B0000019HU|5.0|'Spiderland' is currently a album that I have been listening to more often these days. It's an album I have had for about 10 years now, but it just recently made it's way back into my stereo. This time I actually like it.<br />'Spiderland' was first released in 1991 and it was Slint's second album after 'Tweez'<br />I read many reviews over the last few years, still not sure how I felt about this. Many stated this is the first True Post Rock album.<br />A statement in some ways I still don't get, but no other band influenced by Slint has come close to matching it's depressive, but atmospheric intensity.<br />There has been rumors that the band members of Slint had to be institutionalized during the making of 'Spiderland'-<br />The sound is very lo-fi. Filled with off key guitar distortions which are quite eerie and strange(one of the reasons why it took me so long to get into this record). Very disturbing, and full of slowed down tempo.<br />  Brian McMahan's voice switches from grunge induced screams to mere whispers. And yes, I do prefer this album over another (landmark) album which also came out later in 1991. Although 'Spiderland' was sadly much less known and it still is.<br />  This album truly does mix garage rock, grunge and punk and it's also full of mutters and talking. Really creepy, may be a turn off for some.<br />The song \\"Washer\\" is a very dark track. The protagonist knew his fate, but couldn't avoid it in the end. Despair can be heard throughout.<br />  Opener \\"Breadcrumb Trail\\" - A truly gut-wrenching listen, dissonant guitars over McMahan's intensity. Then on through the closer, and best known track \\"Good Morning Captain\\" where the last lines are McMahan screaming \\"I'm in Hell...I'm in HELLL...I MISS YOU...!\\"<br />- It is hard to believe that these guys were just teenagers when making this album. A Record that inspired Math Rock (?) and bands like Explosions in the Sky and Tortoise. This is a 'must hear' listen and it should be heard on vinyl.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|Having seen all of Season Three already I have to say that it was the best Stargate Season this year. Since SG-1 made the ori-storyline-mistake Stargate Atlantis was able to redeem the franchise.    I am glad that the wraith are taking the back seat this time. The Asurans/Replicators are a much more interesting foe for our heroes.    My only complaint for this season is that it had way too much Rodney in it. He became too annoying. I missed Teyla this season. It seemed that the writers didn't know what to do with her. Nevertheless a great season.    I bet Teyla is referring to Sheppard in Sunday with having feelings for someone.
B000PTYP5C|2.0|What happened to the \\"gods\\" of prog metal?  I just don't get it...Another Dream Theater album that is almost totally devoid of feeling, authenticity, wit, and creativity.  With the exception of perhaps tracks 1 and 8, the music on this album generally lacks spirit, which comes across as being feigned or artificial.  Even worse is the fact that the majority of the songs are drawn out and...well...boring.  It is as if, in an attempt to make the album more progressive sounding, the band decided to tastelessly slow down half of the songs (listen to track 5).  Perhaps it's time for Dream Theater to hand the \\"torch\\" over to Symphony X, a band that--in my opinion--far surpasses Dream Theater on almost every level.       If your new to Dream Theater, don't buy this album.  Try [[ASIN:B000002JPA Images and Words]] or [[ASIN:B000002JKA Awake]] instead.  Both albums are true masterpieces.      And if you like music that's a little heavier and arguably more progressive than newer Dream Theater, I'd highly recommend [[ASIN:B00006L83N Odyssey]] and [[ASIN:B000I8ON6Q Paradise Lost]] by Symphony X.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I haven't seen Alias before. I thought to myself why not try this show out. It could be ok, couldn't it?. The show is so awesome. I couldn't stop watching. Well I had to stop watching because the person who designed the Box (obviously not Rambaldi) did the worst job in the world. Almost every DVD was scratched beyound playability. I use a PS2 to watch my DVDs. The PS2 couldn't handle all those scratched DVDs. My DVD-Rom Drive on the other hand was able to play most of the discs. Still most doesn't mean all of them. I ordered a replacement. After inspecting the first disk of season one from the replacement-box I was utterly dissapointed at first. It was again damaged. But after looking further I found that only a handfull of discs where scratched this time. So now I swapped the scratched discs from the first set with my second one and have now an almost undamaged Collectors set. Thank you amazon for the quick reply to my request.    Buyers of this set beware. Don't let the price fool you. Scratched DVDs everywhere.

038533348X|5.0|cat's cradle, like all of vonnegut's books is a rather odd little piece of work. it's bitingly cynical, deeply depressing, and yet seems to convey a fragile sort of hope all at once.     this book was written as a critique of what mr. vonnegut referred to as unethical scientists, people so concerned with what they might possibly be able to do that they don't stop and think what the consequences of their actions might be. it's rather effective at this in my opinion, creating a scenario that is silly and terrifying all at once.    it's a harsh book, and some people will find that the almost fluffy humor grates with the dark premise and sometimes nasty characters. some people will love it deeply as it showcases vonnegut's ability to hate what humanity is and yet care what becomes of it at the same time.    even if it turns out to not be your thing it's probably worth the read.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|It is hard to describe the plot of 'Donnie Darko' without making the movie seem repellant.  'Donnie Darko' is purposely ambivalent, and the causality of bizarre events is intriguing from the very start.  The journal development is a retro trip in itself.  Using footage of the Dukakis and Bush (I) debates before the 1988 election, the movie authenticates its setting of a high school near the end of the eighties.  How they manage to mix nostalgia with an eerie tale and dark manifestations is a mystery, but they pull it off.  Uniquely enigmatic with the memories they elicit, the movie has the effect of being a 'Twilight Zone' manifestation of 'Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion.' (Aptly, the soundtrack draws from \\"Tears for Fears\\" instead of \\"Bow Wow Wow\\".)    Now about the story.  Our titled tortured protagonist (Jake Gyllenhaal in another talented role) is undergoing psychiatric care complete with medication.  The first hint we have that things aren't going well is when an ominous voice summons Donnie out of bed to meet him somewhere in the dark.  What we discover there on a golf green is a six-foot rabbit, who, if his processed voice weren't so menacing, could only be dismissed with chuckles.  (One can only describe the creature as a rabid or demonic 'Harvey'.)  And, indeed, our best evidence of a demonic presence  is when Donnie asks him later, \\"Why do you wear that stupid bunny suit?\\"  To which the voice quickly replies, \\"Why are you wearing that stupid human suit?\\")  Here he announces to the disturbed adolescent that the world is going to end in approximately a month--Halloween 1988--to be exact.  After that we get varying degrees of maladjustment with some foreboding events.  Upon his return home he discovers he narrowly escaped death when an airplane part fell through his bedroom, leveling much of the house.  A grateful Donnie will do anything for \\"Frank,\\" who saved him from the debacle.  From there a series of inexplicable events take place that leave oneglued to the screen with magnetic interest.    'Donnie Darko' is a mysterious and disturbing alternative movie.  Some of the draw comes with the acting.  Keeping it real is no short order.  The scenes of hypnosis are mesmerizing with Dr. Therman (played with expert delicacy by Katherine Ross) who tries to uncover Donnie's pathology.  But it isn't that easy.  In the meanwhile, Donnie, himself, seeks a teacher at his private school and an elderly woman down the road who has written a book about time travel.  Dabbling with penetrating thoughts about predestination and the occult, Donnie's predicament is fascinating.  Drew Barrymore, whose mere presence could singularly bring flashbacks of the eighties, is the producer and plays lively English teacher, Karen Pomeroy, a character who provides a pivotal place for social commentary.  (Besides a mysterious mood piece, some satire is accessible.)  On the staff is stalwart moral zealot, Mrs. Farmer, who is almost painted in clown white during her ignorant tirades.  There's also preacher-like motivational speaker, Jim Cunningham (Patrick Swayze who makes his character creepy enough) who has a few skeletons in his own closet.    'Donnie Darko' deserves accolades for being so original.  With effective performances that include the delicious novelty of having Donnie's sister played by real-life sister Maggie Gyllenhaal, the elements speak for themselves.  Nevertheless, the overall effect is not as satisying as the creativity, and the story leaves some gaping holes that, while like real life, are unsettling nonetheless.  'Donnie Darko' will fill a black hole for teenagers who will relate to some of Donnie's difficulties that beg for meaning.  (Recommended for a different sort of movie adventure.)
B00005MP58|5.0|I love P&P, and this is the best version.  Most accurate to the book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Some of the best stories for children have presented their worst fears only to have the menace brought down to size.  \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" works that way perfectly.  'Monsters, Inc.' helps to tuck the kiddies in and give them the giggles, too.  Taking near day-glow colors, the Monsters in this fluid Pixar picture are hideously cute.  They live in a \\"green\\" world where the renewable resource of children's fright powers the Monster community.  Looking like the sorts in (Lucas Films, Ltd. is credited here) a 'Star Wars' bar scene, the film's focus is on the power company where the employees go through magic doors, their portals to children's bedrooms where the fright factor generates their power plant.      Heading the troops is big blue \\"Sully\\" (John Goodman) a good natured monster, proud of his ability to be the equivalent of \\"Employee of the Month\\".  Keeping track of his generating power, he is out to set a plant record.  His green, one-eyed sidekick, Mike Wazowski, (Billy Crystal) has a Martian appearance, but his voice couldn't scare a mouse.  He is smitten by one-eyed purple princess, Shroopsy with hydra hair (snake braids).  They all face their competition with rascally Randall, (perfectly villainous, Steve Buscemi) the salamander-like monster with invisible capabilities.  Pivotal to the plot is Mr. Waternoose, (James Coburn) a tycoon who resembles a tarantula in a three-piece suit.  In the causality is 'Silkwood'-like contamination if any child or remnant remains in the Monster world.  (In other words:  Just like parents often say about insects or some animals:  \\"They're more afraid of [children], than [they] are of them.\\")  Sully and James come across \\"Boo\\" whom they find in their best interests to return to the dark realm of her own bedroom.      Formidable to the fore, 'Monsters,...\\" takes a premise that could have been a dumb non-starter, and provides supporting plot structures with enough heft to turn the adventure on.  With Pixar animation, the movement is flowing enough to take the technological edge off the look, and Andrew Stanton and Daniel Gerson's screenplay keep the dialogue fresh and funny.  Director Pete Docter gives the movie proper assembly.  'Monsters, Inc.' is therapeutically good for children's dreamscapes as well as their funny bones.  (Highly recommended to rent and to own.)

B0006ZIJ34|5.0|This DVD Audio/Video disc is absolutely stunning.  I'm somewhat new to 5.1 audio mixes, so perhaps I'm not the best judge since I've only started listening to music this way recently.  Nonetheless, I am amazed at how amazing 1985 era audio sounds by today's standards.  I cannot tell any difference between something mixed in 5.1 today versus this Simple Minds 'Once Upon A Time' 5.1 mix from 1985.  It is truly a gem!<br /><br />The music is spacious, crystal clear, and crisp.  The vocals and music soar all around.  The discrete 5.1 DTS mix makes use of the center channel, which is where the majority of the lead vocals are heard.  Background vocals are scattered throughout the channels.  It's amazing hearing Jim Kerr's voice come through just one speaker.  It really allows one to hear the true dynamics of the original studio recordings, and the quality production that accompanies throughout.  I'm hearing pieces of music that I've never heard before in the original stereo recordings.<br /><br />Included on this DVD Audio/Video Disc:<br /><br />The original 8 tracks in both 5.1 Surround Sound (DVD-A 96/24 + DTS 96/24) and PCM 2.0 Stereo (48/16).<br />01  Once Upon A Time<br />02  All The Things She Said<br />03  Ghost Dancing<br />04  Alive And Kicking<br />05  Oh Jungleland<br />06  I Wish You Were Here<br />07  Sanctify Yourself<br />08  Come A Long Way<br /><br />Note that some songs are actually a few seconds longer than the original CD/vinyl versions.<br /><br />Bonus features include:<br />Lyrics<br />Videos - All The Things She Said + Alive And Kicking<br />Discography<br />Weblinks<br /><br />This DVD Audio/Video is a Virgin/EMI 2005 release made in the EU.<br />UPC:  7 2438-13016-9 2<br />NTSC<br />All Regions<br /><br />The original 24-track analog master tapes were used to create this release.

Additionally, although this is a minor complaint, perhaps it would have been wise to include \\"Don't You (Forget About Me\\" as a bonus 5.1 track and video, simply because it belongs with this project and will probably never see the light of day on a future Simple Minds 5.1 DVD-Audio album release.<br /><br />On a brighter note, I was pleasantly surprised to hear that both music videos presented in this package play in the discrete 5.1 audio as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended!s is a minor complaint, perhaps it would have been wise to include \\"Don't You (Forget About Me\\" as a bonus 5.1 track and video, simply because it belongs with this project and will probably never see the light of day on a future Simple Minds 5.1 DVD-Audio album release.

B000S6LT42|4.0|It's probably my old tv or crappy dvd player, and I don't want to bash the DVD if that's what the problem is, so I'll go with the compromise of 4 stars when I want to give it 5 and throw it in the trash at the same time....  Come on, guys!  Anything but lose Keith's guitar sound!  I'll just say that IF you can hear Keith Richards, and not just the brilliant brass-knuckle playing by Ronnie Wood, I think you'll find this awesome.  It's more of a documentary than \\"Four Flicks\\", though it has two complete concerts and many other songs.  The behind-the-scenes documentary about setting up the concert in Rio de Janeiro -- the Stones played a free concert on Copacabana beach for over a million fans -- confirms your most grandiose conceptions about how rock shows at this level are put together.  My favorite moment was the interview with their guitar stringer -- another (previously) unsung Stones hero, a man in a cramped room somewhere with a pair of pliers surrounded by about a thousand guitars, tuning from dawn to dusk.  The documentary moves from him to the women who decorate the Stones' dressing rooms, the constantly distracted, girl-watching Brazilian construction crew setting up the massive stage, the various engineers, carpenters, security agents, and lastly, the guy who holds the spotlight on Mick during the show... everyone gets their moment of fame here.  It's great stuff if you want to know how a huge Stones concert is done.  As for the concert itself -- Mick, Charlie and Ronnie are great, but it's broken without Keith.  ***UPDATE:  I PLAYED THIS ON BETTER EQUIPMENT AND HEARD KEITH AFTER ALL, THANK HEAVENS, BLASTING THE GOODS.  THIS SET IS WORTH IT FOR \\"GET OFF OF MY CLOUD\\" ALONE, BUT THERE ARE MANY OTHER AWESOME SONGS.  FIVE STARS, IF THEY'D LET ME UPDATE THAT PART OF MY REVIEW!
0440178002|5.0|If you're interested in a summary of the plot, read another review. If you're wondering whether this work of historical fiction is more fiction than history, the answer is \\"yes.\\" However,don't let that put you off the book. Clavell (who was imprisoned by the Japanese in World War II) was very knowledgeable about feudal Japan, and you'll learn a lot. The book is set in the years leading up to the Battle of Sekigahara, which took place in 1600 and established the Tokugawa line of shoguns, which ruled until 1868. In the novel, \\"Tokugawa\\" becomes \\"Toranaga.\\" Blackthorne himself is Clavell's rendering of the historical William Adams, a shipwrecked Englishman who spent his life in Japan. The \\"Taiko\\" refers to a name actually taken by the ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi, whose young son, also a historical figure, is at the center of the political calculations made by various characters in the novel. In addition to the historical background and the lively plot, what makes this novel interesting is Clavell's interest in juxtaposing the mores and cultures of the Westerners (Elizabethan sailors, Portugese traders, Jesuit and Franciscan priests) with those of the Japanese. While Blackthorne is gradually drawn to the more pleasing aspects of the Japanese culture (cleanliness, food, dress, politeness, sex, bravery), he also observes the brutality and authoritarianism of its ruling class and the absolute subordination of its peasants. Clavell's images of unbathed, stinking Westerners chowing down on greasy hunks of meat are indelible and amusing, but his images of groveling villagers trembling with fear at the arrival of their feudal lord are equally indelible---and not so amusing.
032147404X|4.0|I'm a beginner when it comes to photography, and that's why this book was good for me.  It gives a lot of simple hints about what to own (or eventually try to own when you have extra cash sitting around), and how to take certain shots - portrait, night, landscape, sports, etc.  It is a great starter book.........you just have to avoid getting too excited to go out and buy all the gear.  You can spend thousands just adding the tripod heads, filters, special lenses, etc., that Mr. Kelby mentions. But, at least he gets you started and gives some less expensive options too.  It is such an easy book to move through, with simple instructions, so you don't have to be a pro to use his ideas.  I've already put some to work.    A lot of reviewers complain about his dorky sense of humor, and all the parentheses.  Yeah, maybe that space could have been taken up with a little more photography information, but in a world of dry and exhausting instructional books, a little humor isn't something to complain about.  You will enjoy going through this book, probably many times.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This was one of my favorite shows of all time, and its demise caused me physical pain.  Still, we got three seasons, and this one was the very best.  Entertaining, humorous, suspenseful, heartbreaking, stunningly well written.  This is a cross between a \\"Pretty in Pink,\\" \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"Less Than Zero\\" ... but funny!  Though the concept of this post-modern Nancy Drew is a little contrived, the characters are some of the most honestly portrayed teenagers ever on TV who react to the circumstances they are in (no matter how odd) as most teenagers truly would.  And did I mention, it is a whole lot of fun to watch.  One last thing, I am far from being a teenager - this is NOT just a show for teens.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|the me neither of 5th gear. This tune alone is worth the CD purchase, but as usual, it's just one of the many gems on this album.
B000P2A24W|5.0|BON JOVI'S Got it Going On!  Excellent music as always.  Bon Jovi still rocks on!
B000NVIXDW|2.0|I'm sorry but I don't understand. If people want to hear this genre why not steer away from impostors. I think if Michael Bolton and Kenny G. had a baby it would be this guy. Maybe the masses don't hear original, real music so they like this and at least they are exposed to the style and songs but...why go for the impostor?
B000003S0P|4.0|King Crimson's Red album has been said many times to have influenced Nirvana.  No, not the 60's band Nirvana, the influential grunge rock band from the 90's.  I tend to believe there's some truth to that.    There's not many bands back in the mid 70's who rocked with so much power and talent quite like this album.  It's *extremely* guitar heavy with a very muddy and garage-rock sound.  I love it.    The title song is melodically a bit weak thanks to the way it's written- a few guitar riffs repeating over and over for several minutes.      \\"Fallen Angel\\" really is a major jump in another direction.  It's closer to a ballad.  A haunting ballad, that is.  Very good vocals.  The return of those dangerous and threatening guitar riffs come back with a vengeance on \\"One More Red Nightmare\\".  The saxophone solo towards the end is GREAT.    I don't have a problem with \\"Providence\\" at all.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say the first several minutes feature really melodic violin playing.  Truthfully, it's a great song.  Though I don't think the build-up to a noisy and messy jam at the end of the song is very attractive, but it's alright.    \\"Starless\\" is supposed to be the best song on the album.  Is it?  Maybe.  It sure is great.  It's written with such skill and perfection.  Awesome tune.      You need this album if you want to learn about 70's rock.

0634049011|5.0|This title popped up while I was ordering something else, looked interesting so I grabbed it. Within 1 day I already had the technique the author illustrates for finding notes down packed and am now working my way through the rest of the material.    This book is easily the best beginner-intermediate guitar book I have grabbed to date (and I've grabbed quite a few) and illustrates clearly why you are doing something, and what you can expect to know when you do it - something most books tend to leave out.    Having the reader revert to pen and paper exercises is superb, and really drives home the information you need to learn - and allowed me to continue guitar studies while commuting!    In short, this book is clearly written by someone who knows how to teach, not just someone who knows how to play. Not only that the author knows how to teach well, and reinforce the learning's. I have no doubt that I will make significant improvements in my playing by the time I reach the end, and have the basics down packed - by clearly illustrating basic fundamentals that I have struggled to comprehend from other publications, and from teachings.    If you're a beginner or intermediate student, this book is a must. If your advanced and don't understand the concepts in this book - buy it !
B000E41MRC|5.0|Hitler's propaganda minister infamously said, \\"If you tell the Big Lie often enough, people will believe it.\\"  <br />TRIUMPH OF THE WILL is a terrifying look at the zenith of Nazi propaganda. In the future, propaganda would be well-used cinematically by the Soviets (and Michael Moore) but never as well as \\"Triumph of the Will\\". The opening vista in the clouds, soaring above the earth, gives Hitler an almost divine persona. The landing is accompanied by throngs of ordinary people who call out his name as though he was a long-lost relative. The motorcade past the old somber buildings reflects Germany's past , while the parade presents Germany's future. To see these rapt children, teens and older adults in the light of history is to see those whom Hitler would most cruelly betray. Seldom has such evil been presented as messianic. This is the power of mass media perverted and abused.  <br />Students of history and of mass communication would do well to view why a free press is critical to a democratic republic like ours.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I admit I was skeptical when I heard this was \\"Bon Jovi's Country Cd\\", but being a fan for over 20 Years I went ahead and bought the cd anyway even though I don't like most country music. I just got the Cd today and I love it already. If your already a Bon Jovi fan and you've liked everything else they have done you will like this one too.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|The new AFI top 100 film list appeared today and Patton was absent.  I will not disparage the films that made the list, but at least 20 of them are lesser films than this masterpiece: oscars for best picture, actor, director, and script.  This is a great war film, a great biographical film, a great film.  The dialogue is consistently memorable, the set pieces unforgettable.  Scott is brilliant; this is his masterwork (in a career consisting of multiple contending efforts).  If you have not seen this film see it now.  As one of my college teachers once said, \\"If you have not read The Brothers Karamazov go directly to the library and do it.  You might die without having read it.\\"  The same advice applies to Patton.
B000ETQRCM|3.0|On May 2, 2006, one of the most popular and influential artists of their time, Pearl Jam, releases their eighth studio album simply entitled \\"Pearl Jam\\" with promises to deliver a sound reminiscent of their early grunge days.  Although the band kept their promise, including heavy \\"Vitalogy\\"-like guitars and a notable return of Eddie Vedder's dominant vocal style, the album as a whole fell short of the band's potential only surpassing \\"Yield\\" and \\"Riot Act\\" in quality.    Highlights of the album such as the songs \\"Life Wasted, \\"Gone\\" and \\"Inside Job\\" provide Pearl Jam fans with classic, hard-hitting tunes while the remainder of the album leaves something more to be desired either lyrically and musically.  Much respect should be given to the band for attempting to revive the formula that has brought them more than a decade of success, however, albums such as \\"Ten,\\" \\"Vs,\\" \\"Vitalogy,\\" \\"No Code\\" and \\"Binaural\\" better represent the potential of Pearl Jam.  Below, please find the rating for each song individually:     Life Wasted - 10/10    World Wide Suicide - 7/10    Comatose - 6/10    Severed Hand - 5/10    Marker In The Sand - 7/10    Parachutes - 7/10    Unemployable - 7/10    Big Wave - 6/10    Gone - 9/10    Wasted (Reprise) - 5/10    Army Reserve - 7/10    Come Back - 8/10    Inside Job - 10/10
B000005HLV|5.0|Along with Darkthrone's A Blaze In The Northern Sky this is a masterpiece in Black Metal. Very cold and dark the way True Black Metal is suppose to be. Euronymous Raw (but memorable riffs), Hellhammer's brilliant drum work, Varg's nasty distorted bass and Attila's cold vocals make this a must have in any metal fans collection. And to all those stupid fags who gave this album less than 5 stars go kill yourselves you deaf retards.  <br />  <br />  <br />
1594489505|5.0|I'm apparently one of the rare readers who was somewhat disappointed with The Kite Runner. In my opinion Hosseini failed to finish the story well, as if he just couldn't quite figure out how to bring it all together. And so when I picked up A Thousand Splendid Suns I didn't know what to expect. How would his second novel compare?<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to report that Hosseini has really done it this time. A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of the most moving and emotional stories I have ever read. The first 300 pages are complete, unabated heart-wrenching sorrow and grief. At that point I have to admit that I was starting to feel a bit like the reader is beaten over the head with tragedy without any letup whatsoever. But just when I thought I couldn't take any more, the story takes a drastic (if somewhat predictable) turn. It's by no means the end of the suffering for everyone, but it works its way to a solid and gratifying resolution. This is a truly epic story of pain, suffering, and, ultimately, perseverance that the reader will not soon forget.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|seriously.<br />i say to all bands out there<br />if you want to write music about how you feel and want it heard<br />write a ********* solo album<br />dont ruin the band youre with<br />i have few words to say for this album<br />yes change is good<br />but this is just horrible<br />i couldnt get though 3 songs<br />without wanting to throw it out the window<br />do new but mix old<br />it works<br />and i hope to god they dont tour this album
B000P2A24W|4.0|Being a fan of Bon Jovi's since the beginning,I have enjoyed everything the boys from New Jersey have put out.I love the fact that they keep re-inventing themselves,Bon Jovi style,never really caring what the critics think. So we get to the latest Lost Highway. Have so many faves from the album.Probably my favorite track is the song,We Got It Goin On.A song co-written with Big & Rich.Bon Jovi'ish with the modern country twist.A good rocker with the Bon Jovi patent sound.Other standouts are,(You want To) Make A Memory,Lost Highway,Summertime,I Love This Town,Everybody's Broken and the fine ballad,Till We Ain't Starngers Anymore,done with LeAnn Rimes.If you are a big Bon Jovi fan from the 80's and have enjoyed their maturation through the years,there is no reason why you should not want to pick this one up. For me as a music fan,I am very open-minded and appreciate good music,from whatever genre it is.<br />Lost Highway is a gem and I rate it a solid 4.5!!!!!! Go get it and enjoy the patented rocker and ballad albums that Jon keeps putting out.
B000O77QDI|4.0|The Movie Itself is one part of a pair of films done by legendary actor/director Clint Eastwood about the battle at Iwo Jima in World War II. \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" is one of two films that Clint did about the battle from both side's perspectives. \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" (this movie's counter-part) tells the Japanese perspective. While this film tells the American perspective I guess you could say, it's primarily about a real life photo that can be found on the cover of this release. The picture is a very patriotic photograph that shows six soldiers raising the American flag after the battle at Iwo Jima. This picture starts a lot of media coverage and hype labeling the three surviving soldiers \\"war heroes.\\" This film follows the lives during and after that battle of those three remaining soldiers, John \\"Doc\\" Bradley (played by Ryan Phillippe), Rene Gagnon (played by Jesse Bradford) and Ira Hayes (played by Adam Beach). I'd like to point out that this film is based on true events and the names of the soldiers are real. In fact the original book \\"Flags of Our Fathers\\" was written by James Bradley (son of John \\"Doc\\" Bradley). This film was also produced by Hollywood legend Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />These three soldiers are brought home labeled as \\"war heroes\\" as stated above and soon being used by the U.S. government to help sell war bonds to help the war effort. Which they do accomplish but at the same time there's a lot of demons inside these men that came from seeing such a horrific battle at Iwo Jima. This is especially true for both John Bradley and Ira Hayes who throughout the film have post-war stress induced flashbacks that really got to them on a really emotional level that they can't talk about with anyone or even come to terms with themselves. This movie is not one that glorifies war but instead one that shows the hell that comes with it. So if you're expecting to see a bunch of Japanese get slaughtered you might wanna look elsewhere and seek therapy. That's not what this movie is about. This movie and what it stands for can really be stated best by a quote by the real John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, \\"The real heroes of Iwo Jima are the guys who didn't come back\\". I think after watching this film that Clint Eastwood made you'll have a better understanding for that quote.<br /><br />Video Quality on this release is presented in 1080p VC-1 encoded on a 30gb HD DVD for the feature film. This film visually is up there with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" in terms of amazing visual CG special effects and such. Even though war as it is portrayed in this film is a very ugly and disturbing thing to watch at times, this release in terms of video quality itself really does offer just an amazing transfer with great picture. The blacks are perfect, no artifacts or pixilation to be found in this video presentation. The cinematography style that this film as well as it's counter-part, \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" uses might lead some to think the contrast is off but it's just the visual style that Clint Eastwood was going for to show the time period in both films. This release is one of the best in terms of video quality yet from Paramount and I hope it's a sign of things to come.<br /><br />Audio Quality on this release is the standard Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 1.5Mbps. One thing most important to this sound mix is the fact it's a film about war, World War II at that. So it's kind of expected a movie like this have a great surround mix and I can honestly say it lives up to those expectations very much so. Dialog comes out in obviously the center and front channels as you'd expect in the less intense scenes of the film. When you're in the flashbacks of battle scenes of the film you really notice an awesome surround presence that will make you hear gunfire up close, distant or passing gunfire as well as mortar shells. The surround experience on this release is one that is sure to please any action film fan.<br /><br />Bonus Materials are included on their very own extra HD DVD and are in High Definition. First off there's \\"An Introduction by Clint Eastwood\\" (5 minutes), then \\"Words on the Page\\" (17 minutes) which tells us a bit about the original book written by James Bradley. James is the son of John Bradley (played by Ryan Phillipe in the film). This feature offers interviews with James Bradley (again the book's original author) as well as the screenplay writers William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis. Next is \\"Six Brave Men\\" (20 minutes) which tells the personal stories of each of the six real life soldiers in the photograph and offers interviews with the actors who portray them in this film. \\"The Making of an Epic\\" (30 minutes) is your typical making of documentary of a film. It includes interviews with everyone from the producer (Robert Lorenz), director of photography (Tom Stern), special effects coordinator, editor (Joel Cox), art director, costume designer and even the military technical adviser. \\"The Making of an Epic\\" is really by far the real highlight of the bonus materials for this film and looks amazing in High Def. \\"Raising the Flag\\" (3 minutes) is a short feature about reenacting the photograph that the film is primarily about in the film just as it was in real life. \\"Visual Effects\\" (15 minutes) is exactly what the name says, a feature on the visual (\\"CG\\") special effects used on this film. \\"Looking into the Past\\" (10 minutes) offers up a lot of old historical military video footage of the actual battle at Iwo Jima. History Channel fans will definitely love this while some of the more action film oriented crowd may want to skip this. The last feature included is the original Theatrical Trailer in High Def. This release definitely packs some great bonus materials on it's very own disc and is really impressive.<br /><br />-- Review written by Justin Sluss of HighDefDiscNews.comuded on their very own extra HD DVD and are in High Definition.

B000J10ERO|4.0|The only problem I have with the plot is Superman's roundtrip flight to Krypton in 5 years. Jorel states that he's \\"been dead for many thousands of your years\\" and it doesn't make much sense that it only take 2.5 years to reach Earth. I always thought the spaceship had some sort of age suppression technology and it took the infant Kalel a long time to reach Earth.    It would have been much better if the movie started off with a spectacular action sequence in which Superman does something that causes the death of someone while trying to protect them. Then he decides to go into exile and returns 5 years later. Other than that, I thought the movie was great with outstanding visual effects and a stellar cast.

4770030088|2.0|Not for the casual tourist who will vacation in Japan. Using this book, you will not learn the necessary phrases for a short trip to Japan. If you want to learn common phrases, do not buy this book. It was designed for serious students of the language.    On that note, it is unbelievable that a text book of this caliber would be Romanized. If you are a serious student, then take this review seriously: learn hiragana immediately. Do not buy this book; buy the kana version of this book, and begin studying hiragana while you are waiting for it to arrive in the mail. If your college forces you to buy the Romanized version (like mine did), do future students a favor by requesting that they switch over to the kana version.    Although my review of this book sounds harsh, do not be mislead. I like the Japanese for Busy People text book series, and, like all serious students of the Japanese language, despise Romanized books. Buy the kana version.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Always looks forward to what sound Jack & Meg will bring on each album. Always taking musical challenges and giving up real good stuff. Icky Thump continues that tradition.Really from beginning to end ,Jack takes us in and only wanting us to want more and more. Starting it off with the very Hendrix influenced,infected rocker,Icky Thump.Jack White really shows on this track,how good of a guitar player he is,along with Bone Broke and Little Cream Soda.Other notable tracks are,You Don't Know What Love Is...,Conquest,the mentioned Bone Broke & Little Cream Soda,Rag & Bone,A Martyr For My Love For You(Probably my fave on album) and Effect and Cause.Just a fine mix of different sounds.Jack White is a real talented musician and know he will be around for a very long time. Either producing,writing,acting and further developing his other project,The Raconteurs.<br />If you have purchased his other works and The Racontuers,there is no reason to sit this one out. It is HOT and will only expose Jack and Meg as a great duo for years and years to come...A solid 4.5!!!!!
B000N0WCLC|4.0|The Movie Itself received 5 Academy Award nominations, including best actor and best supporting actor. \\"Blood Diamond\\" was directed by Edward Zwick. The film itself is set in Sierra Leone Africa in 1999 during a civil war over \\"blood diamonds.\\" These diamonds in the mines are found by the kidnapped boys that are forced to be made part of the rebel forces. Once found the diamonds then are smuggled out of the country and used basically to buy more weapons and just make the war even worse.<br /><br />The film primarily stars Leonardo DiCaprio as \\"Danny Archer\\" (an ex-mercenary turned smuggler), Dijimon Honsou as \\"Solomon Vandy\\" (an African fisherman who's struggling against rebel forces to reunite with his family) and Jennifer Connelly as \\"Maddy Bowen\\" (an American journalist trying to expose the \\"Blood Diamond\\" ordeal going on in Africa).<br /><br />The basic plot here to the film is that \\"Solomon Vandy\\" has been kidnapped by rebels who took his family and put his son \\"Dia Vandy\\" in the rebel army. \\"Soloman\\" is forced to work in the diamond mines and finds a huge pink diamond. After seeing that others who try to hide diamonds they find get executed by the commander of the rebel forces, \\"Soloman\\" still tries to hide this one in between his toes. He tells the foreman he needs to use the bathroom to try to make a smooth get away and hide the diamond but things don't go as planned. Long story short \\"Soloman\\" ends up in jail with \\"Danny Archer\\" who knows that he has hid the diamond. So \\"Archer\\" arranges for him to be released after he gets out himself and offers to help him get back his family in exchange for the diamond. Sounds simple enough, right?<br /><br />I can now see why this film got the Academy Award nominations it that it did for best actor and best supporting actor. This is honestly a really good film.<br /><br />Video Quality on this release is in VC-1 on a 50 gigabyte Dual-Layer Blu-ray Disc. The real problem here is consistency in the video quality. A majority of the time (especially the outdoors scenes) the picture is great but there are some rare occasions that (even other reviewers have noted) have some artifacts and pixilation problems. The real thing that tends to make this show is smoke in dark scenes. The black level is overall solid. Chances are by the time this film makes it's way to HD DVD I would say Warner Brothers will redo the video transfer. Considering like I said, this problem has been stated by others than just myself.<br /><br />Overall though the video quality is good on this release and the rare problems in the consistency should not discourage the Blu-ray consumer from purchasing this release. If it does discourage you from purchasing this Blu-ray and you don't own a HD DVD player, you're totally going to be missing out on a really good film. If you do own a HD DVD player and are still a bit skeptic, my best advice for you is to wait until July when the film will be released on HD DVD.<br /><br />Audio Quality on this release is in Uncompressed Linear PCM 5.1 @4.6Mbps as well as standard Dolby Digital 5.1. Like \\"The Departed\\" on Blu-ray Disc Warner Brothers decided to give this release a PCM 5.1 track. This is one of the few Warner releases on Blu-ray Disc to feature this and it's a shame because this really pays off to make for an amazing sound experience. The sounds of everything from crickets to gunfire to explosions to even the score sound absolutely awesome.<br /><br />Bonus Materials on this release are in 16:9 (Widescreen) standard definition. First off is obviously an audio commentary by Director Edward Zwick. All of the bonus materials have subtitles to them here and pretty much describe what they are so I won't be going into a lot of detail unless it's noteworthy. There's \\"Focus Points: Featurettes and Production Diaries (46 minutes) which is pretty much the \\"making of\\" to this film. \\"Blood on the Stone: Follow a Diamond's Path from the Ground to the Store\\" (50 minutes) is a really in-depth look at the real \\"Blood Diamonds\\" out there. \\"Becoming Archer: Profiling Leonardo DiCaprio\\" (8 minutes) is just as it says, just a profile on Leo in this film. \\"Journalism on the Front Line: Jennifer Connelly on Women Journalists at War\\" (5 minutes) on the other hand is less about her and more about the actual women journalists that do cover these type of events. \\"Inside the Siege of Freetown: Edward Zwick on One of the Movie's Pivotal Sequences\\" (10 minutes) is really interesting and worth watching. Lastly there is the music video for \\"Shine on Em\\" by Nas.

1582701709|1.0|That's basically the secret (sorry if I cheated the \\"authors\\" out of any money. I guess they were just thinking negatively today, huh?). And oh yeah, you also have to work hard, study, and do all the other material efforts in order to achieve your goal. You know, just as you did prior to knowing the \\"secret\\", only then you had a bit more pocket change. Some of the principles are simple and even helpful enough: certainly, maintaining a cheerful and positive attitude will help one in most endeavours. However, what I (and anyone with an ounce of humanity) hates about this book and belief system is that it essentially blames victims of tragedies for bringing them upon themselves (apparently, every Jew in Europe in the 1930s must had been thinking bad thoughts, because that's the concept of why the Holocaust happened according to this line of reasoning) and disregards social inequalities for why some people are born into status (Paris Hilton must had been one positive thinking fetus!). Bottomline: this is amateur pyscho babble mixed in with New Age techniques and some pseudo Eastern and faux science. Keep your chin up, work hard, and save your money!
B000PMGS8G|5.0|I'm glad this edition is being put out because I had the OOP version and the voice track was off which was annoying to watch the mouths open but the words were off. So I'm happy to get an edition of this movie that is watchable and enjoyable! Plus Sam was one of my crushes in middle school!
B000PFUAO6|3.0|I picked up Systematic Chaos because there is just so little to like in mainstream music that I thought that I would give this disc a shot. There is not a lot to dislike here, as always the band is tight and sharp but this time out it just felt that each musical shift borrowed too much from a differnet band. The cocktail is too much of an homage to other bands and not enough of an original sound. You can hear vintage RUSH, dead on Metallica mimicry... I think someone in the recording studio must have been playing \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" on their ipod. James LaBrie's vocals even venture towards GrindCore and flat out barking... such a waste. Lots of Pink Floydesque and Queensryche packed in too. Pretty serious Joe Satriani riffing and Yes keyboarding too... I mean I guess it is a complement to those artists...So after all of that I still enjoy the disc... so few bands even come close to this anymore. I recommend this for anyone who can't name the last 5 American Idol's. Systematic Chaos is uninspired but better than listening to Nickelback or My Chemical Romance.... it does fill a niche and a void.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|The Movies Themselves are the science fiction cult classics written, directed by The Wachowski Brothers and primarily star Keanu Reeves as \\"Neo\\", Laurence Fishburne as \\"Morpheus\\", Carrie-Anne Moss as \\"Trinity\\" and Hugo Weaving as \\"Agent Smith.\\" If you're one of the of the few people who have never seen these films then you're in for \\"one hell of a high definition treat!\\" These films include some of the best action sequences and CG special effects since Star Wars. Don't get mad at me if you're a fanboy for that statement, I'm just saying that these flicks really have set the benchmark for this type of action in Hollywood. It's been copied time and time again but no one can do anything as incredible as these trilogy of films did in theatrical release. This is THE BEST HD DVD RELEASE YET, hands down.<br /><br />Video Quality on this release is VC-1 encoded on three 30gb Dual-Layered HD DVD's, one disc for each film obviously. As stated above these films are by far probably some of the best films ever for action sequences and CG special effects. So this release obviously held high expectations from everyone to be an amazing video transfer not only on the first film but all three. Well they didn't let us down, this is some of the best \\"eye candy\\" in high definition available. The video transfer on the first film ( \\"The Matrix\\" ) isn't quiet as good as the second two films in the trilogy video-wise at points but it is definitely a transfer I would have rated at least a 4 1/2 if I reviewed the films seperately. This is kind of disappointing in a way but you have to realize that film probably wasn't shot on the same type of cameras and such. Because the second two films were shot planned back to back they really hold the same video quality feel. I'm not complaining though, don't get me wrong. This is a great release in terms of video quality!<br /><br />Audio Quality on this release is in Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (which is by far the best choice and really going to blow you away) and Dolby Digital Plus 5.1 @ 640kbps.

B000O38H2G|5.0|\\"Lirael\\" is neither the beginning nor the end (thank goodness) of this remarkable fantasy series by Garth Nix.  If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", you might want to put \\"Lirael\\" aside and begin at the beginning.  The middle book could stand alone, especially the story of Lirael herself, but you will miss nuances of the Philosophy and Geography of Death if you don't start with \\"Sabriel\\".  The only work I can compare this series to is Philip Pullman's \\"Golden Compass\\" trilogy, although I prefer Nix's magical world-building.  If I ever die and go to fantasy heaven, I hope it resembles his immense library beneath glacier and mountain, where each door opens into a separate mystery.  In the catacombs beneath the library, Lirael discovers how to turn herself into an ice otter or a barking owl, reads \\"The Book of Remembrance and Forgetting\\", and duels with the monstrous Stilken.<br /><br />However, \\"Lirael\\" isn't just about Lirael.  Prince Sameth, heir apparent to Sabriel as the Old Kingdom's champion against evil necromancers, also comes of age in this volume.  There are plenty of evil necromancers to go around.  In fact, at the end of this book, it appears as though they are winning the war to turn the Old Kingdom into a kingdom of the dead.<br /><br />One fault should be noted. The two main characters spend too much text feeling sorry for themselves.  Lirael pursues an impossible dream, while Prince Sameth tries to escape from an impossible nightmare.  I think the author's editor must have read \\"Sabriel\\" and said, \\"Garth, this is a great fantasy but your heroine, Sabriel is pretty darn self-sufficient.  Readers can't relate to that.  You need to make your characters more vulnerable.\\"  So that's exactly what Nix did in Volume Two.  Vulnerability often shades over into self-pity in \\"Lirael\\"---too often for my liking.  It's not enough of an annoyance to bypass this fantasy.  Hopefully, in the yet-to-be-published \\"Abhorsen\\", Lirael and Prince Sameth will stop whining and take up the burden of defending the Old Kingdom.  Lirael is already headed in that direction, along with her friend the Disreputable Dog.<br /><br />Garth, I advise you to stop listening to your editor.  You were pitch-perfect in \\"Sabriel\\". Retune `Astarael, the Sorrowful' that \\"casts all who hear it deep into Death\\" and finish this marvelous trilogy the way you began it.rden of defending the Old Kingdom.

0743454537|4.0|In \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" Jodi Picoult writes in short vignettes, each from the perspective of several characters, to express what is going on within a family caught in a web of complex and frightening interdependency. There is a mom, a dad, and three teenage children. Kate, the second child, has had leukemia since age two. Anna, three years younger, was conceived in a petri dish, selected from several fertilized eggs and implanted in her mother's womb for the specific purpose of harvesting her umbilical cord blood to save Kate. Jesse, the oldest child is invisible to his parents; his blood was not a match for Kate's. Brian, the dad, is a fire fighter, but can't put out the blaze in his wife's heart to keep Kate alive at any price. The novel deals with many themes, but two stood out for me: family communication and adultism.<br /><br />Family communication is difficult in many households, and Picoult writes with believable accuracy about her characters' inability to speak their truths: assumptions are made, incomplete sentences are delivered; characters misinterpret the actions of others. There is an overriding sense of \\"I can't say this to you, you wouldn't understand.\\" Emotions are so charged and the story so intense, the reader can't help but imagine being caught in such a web, unable to speak true for fear of hurting those most beloved. The oldest child, Jesse, has given up speaking altogether, but his actions belie the intensity of his feeling: \\"I want to blow things up,\\" \\"I want to be seen\\" \\"I want to DO something.\\"<br /><br />Picoult also delves into the heart of adultism, the oppression of young people by adults. This is skillfully done through the character of Anna, the 13-year-old who has engaged a lawyer to help her avoid being forced to donate a kidney to save her sister's life. The adult characters express adultism in many ways. One telling example refers to Anna's thoughts about her presence in the courtroom: \\"Add to that the very bizarre way I have to listen to everyone talk about my life as if they can't see me sitting right there...\\" Anna's lawyer, Campbell, questions the head of the hospital's ethics committee about the age of consent and is told that children are not consulted about health decisions until age 13. Anna's parents don't even ask her if she wants to donate a kidney, but assume she will do whatever is necessary to save her sister.<br /><br />Picoult takes a stab at a subject that, for most of us, is incomprehensible: parents using one child to keep another alive. That alone would have served one novel well, but she seemed compelled to throw in subplots that diluted the main conflict. For example an old love affair between the lawyer and the guardian ad litem assigned to protect Anna's interests. Jesse, the overlooked son, could have been developed more fully and brought to a more complete conclusion. She also causes virtual whiplash for the reader (What??!! Are you kidding me?!) when she kills off Anna at the end of the novel, a gratuitous and ironic plot twist that seemed a cop out. But I applaud her effort to articulate, through her believable characters, the way words fail us when we need them most, and to write a strong, young female character who's thinking is as clear and rational as any of the adults around her.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1889242314 What Kids Really Want to Ask: Using Movies to Start Meaningful Conversations]]ne talk about my life as if they can't see me sitting right there...\\" Anna's lawyer, Campbell, questions the head of the hospital's ethics committee about the age of consent and is told that children are not consulted about health decisions until age 13.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|The White Stripes survive and thrive on the catchiness of Jack White's guitar playing, which is still as good as ever.  The album feels more like Get Behind Me Satan than Elephant, lending itself more to a grungier type of rock music, complete with bagpipes, trumpets and the delicious pounding drums and keening wail of Jack's guitar.  The album fails to get five stars because: 1. it is not the band's best album and 2. it is not cohesive enough to be a \\"great\\" album.  Any fans of Get Behind Me Satan will love the direction the band is going in and should grab this album.

Now a real classic double tune, as any Beatles, Beach Boys or Elvis piece. Try \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\"... Best Punk Rock tune ever made. Try \\"Get Down Make Love\\" or \\"It's Late\\"... best Classic Rock. Try \\"Who Needs You\\"... best 60s-70s AM classic Pop.<br /><br />No doubt: these Brits of Queen are first-class Rockmakers.

0765348780|4.0|Gardens of the Moon is the first book in the ostentatiously predicted 10 volume series by Steven Erikson.  It can be said to follow Ganoes Paran, who is a noble turned soldier for the Malazan Empire.  However, the cast of characters is so broad that the pages dedicated solely to Ganoes would occupy a minority of the book.  Ganoes' ambition as a young nobleman was to join the ranks of soldiery and after a few years as a cavalryman, he ends up as an attendant to the personal adjunct of the Empress of the Empire.  Other notables to the storyline includes Seargent Whiskyjack of the Bridgeburners, an elite unit of the Malazan military, and his group including an assassin, a healer, a mage and a barbarian.  Another set of notables includes a young thief named Crokus, an eccentric mage named Kruppe, and their group of companions.  In fact, simply to list the cast of characters including nobles, criminals, warriors, gods, demons, and even Raven's would take up quite a bit of space.  This cast of characters occupy the Malazan Empire.  The empire has conquered much of the mainland peninsula of Genabackis after years of continuous warfare.  The ruler of the Malazan empire, Empress Loralee, has occupied the throne for several years subsequent to treacherously assassinating the previous ruler to whom she was pledged.  The empire is campaigning in order to bring down two of the major cities in Genabackis, one by brute force and the other by slightly more subtle means.  It appears that the Empress has her work cut out for her though as her adversaries are many.  A mysterious floating city occupied by mages threaten her plans, and the Gods themselves are becoming involved with her affairs.  <br />  <br />The enormous cast of characters nearly threaten to overwhelm this supremely well-crafted fantasy epic.  As the book jumps from plot to plot it can gives one the feeling that you just haven't quite gotten past the preludes yet.  However, this complexity is also quite impressive as it is clear that Steven Erickson has created not only a new universe but an interwoven storyline full of plots with subplots, intrigue, history, mythology, magic, warfare, and humanity.  Unlike many writers of fantasy, Erikson does not lecture the reader, instead he immerses you in the thick of things.  Some may find this novel to be almost a bit too obtuse and so complex as to be off putting, and I agree that this was the case for me at times. This also served to take away from some of the character development, making for less personal connection with the characters. However, for the most part, this book was refreshingly engrossing.  <br />  <br />There is no clear line in GOTM between good and evil, instead presenting many shades of gray.  It instead comes down to the characters themselves, who often find themselves operating on the side of evil while they themselves are good.  It can be very dark and brutal, but also quite humorous at times.    <br />  <br />Gardens of the Moon is quite unlike many novels in the epic fantasy genre.  It is labyrinthine and high minded, and meticulously detailed.  At times, it is to broad for its own good, but well worth the time of any fantasy fan.
B000PTYP5C|2.0|I got this CD for free.  I should have used my gift card on something else.  Ever since ToT, DT has been going downhill.  I think the key word is 'Boring'.  I was shocked to see DT had put out another CD already.  It doesn't seem that long since Octavarium came out.  I think they should have stayed in the studio a while longer.  The originality seems to be gone.  The songs don't grab you, but leave you grabbing for the remote to skip to next song.  The solos are long and well short of entertaining.  The most original song on this CD was Prophets of War, but listening to LaBrie try to sound politically intellectual ruined it all.  From the first of DT up through 6 Degrees you didn't know what you were getting with each song and were left amazed at what they could do.  The last three CDs including Systematic Chaos have left me feeling blah and thinking they just want to pound out songs and forget the power, passion, and originality they once had.    I only gave them two stars because I was a loyal DT fan and because of their past work.  Chaos really only deserves 1 star.
B000P2A24W|5.0|On my lunch hour, I had to run all over town to find a store that hadn't sold out of Lost Highway.  Would have bought it from Amazon but even overnight was too long to wait for this great album.  Bon Jovi still rocks with great music and lyrics, and Jon Bon Jovi has one of the great distinct voices in music.<br /><br />\\"Make a Memory\\" is a wonderfully nostalgic piece. \\"Hello again, it's you and me/kinda always like it used to be/sippin' wine killin' time/Trying to solve life's mysteries/How's your life? It's been a while/God it's good to see you smile.\\" I picture either empty nesters rediscovering each other or first loves reuniting.<br /><br />Their songs evolve as the guys age to fit perfectly with the kids from the 80s stages of life.  It's been a pleasure to have Bon Jovi's music growing up with me from my teens until now, and I just love that they still use \\"Ain't.\\"  Bon Jovi fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Some favorites:<br /><br />Lost Highway<br />Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore<br />Everybody's Broken<br />One Step Closer<br />Make a Memory<br />The Last Night<br />Any Other Day<br />Whole Lot of Leavin'<br />Summertime<br /><br />Okay, just about every song is great.  Didn't care much for We Got it Going On--seems creepy.  Quit playing with Big & Rich guys!

B000JJS8TM|5.0|This is a soundtrack compilation album by The Beatles released in November 2006. It features music compiled and remixed for the Cirque du Soleil show of the same name. The album was produced by George Martin and his son Giles Martin, who said, \\"What people will be hearing on the album is a new experience, a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period.\\"  Some people may object to remixed versions of Beatles songs, but I think it's great.  Very tastefully done, and not too radically different to ruin the songs.  Give it a listen.

There is no one alive today with his insight, intelligence, and charm to promote the fundamental ingredients that go into being free and the advantages that come from it. The arguement is not simple.  Those that believe in scarcity (i.e., Marx) have a much easier time.  Indeed, most people today find the limits to grow thesis to be much more compelling.  The fact that history has shown that it is almost always wrong seems to change few minds.  It is through great books like this that people can learn.
0385340559|3.0|Long a Reacher fan, but this one is a disappointment. No way am I smarter than Reacher, but I knew right away what was happening and couldn't believe that Reacher was all around it, but didn't catch on. His normal paranoia should have put him there first! I also feel that all the killing is pretty gratuitous. There is, however a lot of enjoyable, classic Reacher/Child, so in spite of all that, I'm looking forward to the next one. Hopefully Reacher, wherever he is, will be back on his game...and will wash his clothes in the shower again this time, instead of just ironing them under the mattress.

B000P6PVLC|4.0|Babel, trying to imitate the wonderful style of Academy Award-winning [[ASIN:B000A3XY5A Crash (Widescreen Edition)]], is a touching, thought provoking story of the world and its peoples.    The movie itself has an amazing premise--a husband, Richard Jones (Brad Pitt) decides to take his wife, Susan (Cate Blanchett) for an exotic vacation to Morocco. But things are hardly exotic, as they will soon find out. From Morocco the story transitions to California, where a Mexican-American maid is left in charge of the Jones' children while the couple are on vacation.    Babel continues to introduce new cultures as Mrs. Jones receives a wound to the shoulder while riding a bus through the deserts of Morocco. From there, a Moroccan family's role in the crime is unraveled, and the story of a Japanese deaf-mute begins.    This movie is truly touching, as all of the subplots intertwine and a feeling of bittersweet catharsis is felt.     This movie should be an absolute must for everyone; your life will be changed after watching this movie.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|All aesthetics aside with the nice hologram box and interesting boxing it all comes in, this series of movies (or trilogy... *awaiting the e-bashing from star wars fans* )is a great collection to own.    Apart from the movies themselves, they all come with revisited discs which go into the background of each movie as well as a seperate box for documentaries on the background of character development, social/philosophical references, set design and visual technology make this a gem of a collection to own.    Top that off with the official animatrix all included in this boxset, you are left with the entire story and background from the movies seires.     To be honest with you, I dont feel the need to watch an entire movie over with commentary from the directors. I feel its a waste of time and if i do look for a particular scene's meaning I would just go to the scene instead of watching the whole thing. Each to their own though.     As are most of my reviews, a lot rides on the price of the boxset. I payed $37 dollars for it and i feel it was worth every penny. Definatly a set I will be holding onto for a while to watch with friends for a few years to come.    If you are looking to get the movies ONLY (which I'm sure a lot of the extras will come with on their extra's disc's) then maybe buying the movies seperatly is for you. However, the slight price difference gives you hours more of entertainment and a broader understanding of the saga.

B000000NN1|5.0|The magical hands of the composer emerge from the whirling hellfires, touching upon the 'sin-thesizer' to entertain the infernal hordes with rippling and dancing notes, manifesting the mesmerizing Fates from the misty flames...<br /><br />Bombastic soundscapes from the genius of this one-man band, sonically describing the mythological battle between 'good' and 'evil', making for a great hypothetical soundtrack. But more than that, it is repleat with glorious choral rises, militant permutations, eerie interludes, and inspirational Ur sound bliss cascades upon the senses like a sonic waterfall, both placid and torrential.<br /><br />In the last six minutes of \\"Heaven And Hell Part I\\", one can perceive the faint origins of \\"Chariots of Fire\\" right before gracefully floating into  the melancholy \\"So Long Ago, So Clear\\", sung by the enchanting vocal talents of Yes' Jon Anderson, reminiscient of Bryan Ferry's style of singing, with Tangerine Dream-like orchestration. Quite moving.<br /><br />'Heaven And Hell Part II' begins darkly brooding, until we are treated to a haunting aria slowly blending into a choral duet, then on to further arcane adventures of the mind...<br /><br />A musical journey into the multi-dimensional subconscious where the imagination may project into the darkness, and otherwise can serve as ritual musick for victory and compassion.

1582701709|2.0|I bought this book and read it a couple of weeks ago because the title caught my interest.  I expected to learn the secrets that successful people (not necessarily wealthy people) utilize in their lives to get results.    I was disappointed.    The book advances the premise that anyone can have all of the material things in life that he/she desires by simply believing that he/she already has it.  It will then appear as if by magic due to the \\"law of attraction\\" which states that believing that we already have something will attract it to us.      She uses the example of the individual who magically began receiving checks in the mail by believing he/she was attracting money.  Think about it for a minute.  For me to receive something of value (wealth), it first has to be created.  Since I'm not doing anything to create it myself, that activity has to be performed by someone else.  Then, that individual (or individuals) must then make the decision to simply give it to me.  This concept is ludicrous to the point of being dangerous.  We already have far too many individuals in our society who are trying to get something for nothing.    Another thing I found disturbing is the focus on material wealth, even making the point that Jesus Christ was actually wealthy.  This teaching has, unfortunately, made it's way into the Christian Church and is being taught, for example, by the Church for All Nations (\\"Jesus Christ is gonna' make me rich!!\\").  The fact is that He consistently preached against the obsession with material wealth.  Ms. Byrne's reference to \\"Ask, and it shall be given...) from Matthew 7:7:8 refers to spiritual gifts, not material gifts.      I'll give Ms. Byrne credit for making a good point: In order to change our lives for the better, we need to begin by changing our beliefs.  However, beyond that she does not emphasize that changes our beliefs will then normally lead to changes in our behavior, which then lead to changes in our results.  The law of attraction is probably due to the fact that individuals who change their beliefs and then act on them, draw positive things and results to themselves by what they do, not just what they believe.      If you're looking for life-changing answers and strategies, bypass this book and pick up anything by Stephen Covey or Anthony Robbins.  Your time will be much better invested.
B000P6R6X8|5.0|Best CD of the 21st Century.  Although it is both lyrically and sonically dense and much can be said for the artistry, it just makes me smile.      Alternative fans will love it, as will fans of folk music.  I think rock and country fans will enjoy it quite a bit as well.  Metal only fans may want to look elsewhere.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|You have to be joking!     In Australia, despite fans being pumped for the release of Grindhouse, we're getting the separate releases of Death Proof and Planet Terror in theatres.    So the only thing we could do was wait until Grindhouse was released on DVD and then see it.     Only now it looks like they're planning on releasing Grindhouse in split versions on DVD in the US.     Last time I looked, Grindhouse - Grindhouse has two films, trailers and runs 195 minutes and that's the film we've been hanging out to see. It's also the creators' vision, but I guess that doesn't mean anything.    No matter how good these films may be, they are NOT Grindhouse. Even if Death Proof and Planet Terror are ***** films, this insulting joke of a release gets * (and that only because Amazon doesn't have a zero rating).    If they wanted to wring more money out of us, they could have released the separate films on DVD in 'complete' versions. After all, Tarantino himself said they shot the two flicks as full films then edited them back down so they were Grindhouse-worthy. Fans of the cinema version will probably pay to see the 'original' versions of the films. I would. It would also let viewers who didn't like both films get the one they want.    But no, we get this pathetic travesty.    Release the theatrical version of Grindhouse on DVD and you get my money. Until then...
1878424319|5.0|Over the course of several years of coaching leadership groups it never ceases to amaze me how often group members and I, myself, find crucial applications for these deceptively simple Four Agreements.  When we don't KNOW we all have a strong desire to fill in the blank.  When we remember Ruiz's guidance to Never Assume, and to not Take It Personally, we can hold off our anxiety, and leave it blank until we do really know the facts.  The author does a great job of expanding our thinking on these simple principles and convinces us that life may not really be that complicated after all if we don't make it so.  On the personal level I have bought a copy of this book for every one of my grown children and they all love it!<br /><br />Michael Arloski, Ph.D., PCC, author of Wellness Coaching For Lasting Lifestyle Change

What exactly is this book about?  I got lost after the first couple paragraphs and even reread them to see if I could figure it out.  Nope.  Not worth it.  Gonna sell this one.  Sorry if it's YOU that ends up with it...

B00005NDEO|5.0|It's been well over thirty years since this album came out and I finally bought it. I've been missing out on a lot of fantastic music. This album is extraordinary in its own merit, and I finally understand what \\"Queen\\" really was all about - the entire experience! Sure, \\"You're My Best Friend\\" was a really nice song and \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" defined an entire generation, but hearing it as it was pieced together in one collage of a musical experience and you'll understand what the big fuss is all about. Freddie Mercury's vocals are astounding. There simply is no `best' song on this album. Every song is its own masterpiece, but I am partial to the anthemic, \\"'39\\". God Save the Queen!

B00005K3NR|5.0|Stephen King's first big hit comes to the big screen, and thirty years later it has morphed into something else.  Stephen King created Carrie thanks to a few happenstances.  He was working for a laundry service when one day they were in a women's locker room, and he saw the dispense of feminine hygiene products.  He asked someone what it was, a coworker told him.  He had just read an article about telekinisis, and that night he went home and wrote the first scene of Carrie, when she gets her period in the shower and it awakens the power within her.  He threw it away, but a few days later he came home to find his wife, Tabitha, had dug it out of the trash.  When she asked if he had writen this, he said it was just an idea he'd had but didn't like it.  Per her insistance, he went on to write more.  Tabitha told him \\"No this is good, you've got something here.\\"  Tabitha helped him, as it was a story about girl stuff.  He based Carrie on the two ugliest girls he knew growing up, and her mother around a devoutly religious woman he worked with who he always wondered what her home life was like.  It was submitted and published, and Stephen King had his first big hit.  And, the rest is history.  <br />  <br />Carrie is the story of a squelched, nervous outcast.  It takes place in the most horrifying of places, high school.  Pushed around, teased relentlessly, and made to feel the butt of every joke, Carrie is trapped between the laughter of her peers and the heavy handed world of her mother's religious beliefs.  She's odd, afraid, nervous.  Then, one day, when the late bloomer reaches maturity right in the middle of the gym locker room shower and made a fool of by the other girls, the power is awakened within her.  Suddenly she has the power to think and effect people.  When that mean boy down the street harasses her on his bike, she throws him an angry glare and he falls off his bike.  When in the second half, one of the girls from the locker room, Sue Snell, feels guiltyabout her behavior, she does something completely out of character for a \\"popular girl\\".  SHe not only feels guilty, but asks her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom to make up for it.  Her boyfriend Tommy, the handsome, equally popular all American nice guy agrees, and they go to the prom.  Carrie, in the one and only time she ever had a real date, looked pretty as a picture, and is even voted queen, is subjected to the ultimate humiliation when the queen bee and her legion of thugs dump pig blood on her.  Carrie uses her telekinetic powers to take out her revenge, and burns down the town, killing hundreds in her path.    <br />  <br />Why is this such a great story?  Because it speaks to each and every one of us on some level.  Rebelling against the old world parent, lashing out at teachers who were too meddlesome or ignorant.  Transforming from an ugly ducking into a swan, and the handsome prince comes riding in a white horse to take us to his enchanted kingdom (in this case, the prom).  Having hope that you can break out of your social mold, that you too can be everything you secretly wanted to be.  And when the final insult comes, the one that breaks you, the one that you can't just turn the other cheek this time, you can kill them all with your secret power that you always wished you had.    <br />  <br />This was a long time ago, and it shows.  Political correctness has overtaken us (the bullying aspect that might have lead Carrie to mow everyone down with an assult riffle if she didn't have the power), fashion has changed, etc.  And the shrillness of the acting, corny, antiquated special effects make it just as campy rather than a serious drama / horror now (thanks mostly to Mrs. White played hilariously by Piper Laurie).  And yet, add the element of the fanatic mother who is really REALLY crazy (and happened to put all her crazy energies into Christianity rather than the bottle, self mutilation, or promiscuity) yet somehow right all along about people really gives us something to think about in the end.  A timeless classic.
0743289684|5.0|I knew nothing of Ayaan Hirsi Ali when I purchased this book, but I'd heard some of the \\"buzz\\" regarding this book and decided to read it. I had read and heard snipets of information regarding the lives of Moslem women is Islamic countries, but this was the first time I'd read one woman's story and I was engrossed from the beginning.  <br />  <br />Granted, some of what Ms. Ali lived through as a child had more to do with tribalism than Islam, but it is fascinating that Islam allows for this and accepts this. Ms. Ali's story is not perfect - I don't think she purports to be perfect - but it is her story and she has allowed all of us to share in it. As she re-lives her childhood, her immigration to Europe, and eventual assimilation into the West, she brings the reader along to share in her joys, her sadness, her frustrations, and her accomplishments. Her story is one of achieving and attempting to become to the fullest the human being she was meant to be. A wonderful book of courage and accomplishment!  <br />
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This is one of tv's best shows! I am very srry that it was cancelled! I hope the cw brings it back! I would recomend this show to anyone who likes drama and mystery!
B000P2A24W|2.0|Wow, I've been a Jovi Fan since the very beginning...hell, I used to sit outside his house in Sayreville, NJ just hoping to get a glimpse of him!  (I did end up meeting him and the guys quite a few times)  So one of the most important reasons I still listen to these guys is that they are true rockers and always stayed true to their music.    After hearing their previous album, \\"Have a Nice Day\\", I was torn.  I liked it, but I thought it was getting a bit \\"pansy-ish\\". Plus, I totally hated the song with the chick from Sugarland \\"Who Says you Can't Go Home\\".  Not because it was bad, just because I despise country music.  Always have and always will.  Needless to say, as soon as I saw the success they had with this \\"country\\" hit, I knew Jon would teeter with the idea of targeting the country market.  After all, it's the number one \\"genre\\" of music and the biggest money maker.  So Jon, why would you sell out???  I don't think it's because you guys need the money!  But then again, the more you have, the more you want right?    So back to the actual review of THIS mess of an album.....  The first single, \\"memory\\" is not that bad, but it's just so predictable. It's typical Jon and it's getting old.  The rest of the album was pretty much unbearable to listen to, since I can't stand anything that has a \\"country\\" sound to it, so I'll just stop here since I don't want to get certain people pissed off.    Bottom line, I won't be buying this album, I won't be seeing the tour and I certainly won't be holding my breath for the \\"real\\" Bon Jovi to come back.....    WOW, SOOOOO DISAPPOINTING!!!!!!!!!
B000P2A256|3.0|How did a rock/soul band with an edge transform into a cheesy 80s dance boy-band? Some songs resemble SAJ very closely, except they are more nasal, and more corny. Bring the ROCK back, Maroon 5!!!
B00005N9CV|3.0|The cover featuring the very beautiful Diana Krall certainly will help sales. My apologies to her many fans as I must confess to not being one of them.  I am sure the enjoyment she seems to give people is real.  This is simply my take on her overall sound and impact.<br /><br />  Diana studied extensively with Jimmy Rowles and seemed to be on the inside early on when she was very young. With so much assistance and encouragement, she learned to play. She worked hard at it and it shows - you can only applaud that. However, the playing, IMHO, is not distinctive.  It sounds like good jazz piano but there is no unmistakable sound.  There is nothing that separates her playing from the fold.  Great jazz musicians develop a sound, a trademark approach, something unique and new.  You can easily tell Bill Evans apart from Monk or Peterson for example.  This is very competent playing but there is no signature concept or sound yet in her still young career.  Her singing can sound nice also, but she has no show stopping voice, nor show stopping style.<br /><br />  I do believe she will continue to develop and perhaps someday I'll eat these words.  I truly hope so!  In the meantime she is still in search of her own sound. Again, simply one mans opinion and I encourage you to take a listen.  We need more women in jazz and the piano - voice one two punch she possesses could still be a poignant force in the future.
B00003CXD0|5.0|The only thing this movie lacks is a deluxe edition on DVD with commentaries, featurettes, interviews, etc., etc. This is classic comedy, well deserving of its status. So why is the DVD release a bare-bones one with only chapter selection, trailer and printed cast bios the only bonus features? Then again it's not now generally available, which probably means an anniversary edition is in the offing and I've wasted my money buying the currently almost-available version. It's a gem and yes, Dustin Hoffman was robbed. He should have had the Oscar for best actor...or even best actress...no matter who the competition was!
B000MPPK08|5.0|Extraordinary story of prity fashion model looking for love in a world of one night stands. Must see what she can do.
0743289412|1.0|Admittedly I am not the biggest Stephen King fan going but trudging through much of Lisey's Story was quite painful.  Like many reviewers here, I found the imaginary language between Scott and Lisey to be truly annoying and unnecessary.  I got about 400 pages in and couldn't go on any further and honestly I didn't care where the story was headed.  Luckily my local Target had The Road by Cormac McCarthy in the bargain bin and I've started my summer reading that.  Time much better spent in my opinion.
B000000OQY|3.0|People, people--\\"I Used to Love Her\\" is NOT about killing and burying a girlfriend, it's about putting down and burying a dog.  The word that in clean contexts means \\"female dog,\\" but which is usually used as a derogatory word for women, takes its literal meaning in this song.  That's the joke.  That having been said, it isn't a very funny joke.    As for my review, I bought this album a long time ago for \\"Patience,\\" but rarely listen to the whole thing, since it sounds just like what it is--a cobbled-together album to keep the group in the spotlight.  And I do object to \\"One in a Million.\\"  This album is pretty much for completists only.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|Why did they wait so long to release the Saviour Of The Universe Edition. It's a campy movie, but it brings back a lot of memories for me. I must've written these bozos numerous times if they were ever going to re-release the film on DVD in the first place. Although I have the U.K. version with the director's commentary, the 30 minute interview with Mike Hodges, a theatrical trailer and photo gallery, I do admire Alex Ross's artwork and I'm looking forward to seeing what's on the U.S. version and I'll be buying the soundtrack with the \\"Flash Remix\\" I'll be ready on August 7th.
B0000025P9|5.0|When you've had enough of pimple-faced rap-metal punks and exceedingly dull music and sub-standard playing, where do you go?  Unless your bag is heavy metal, where guitar virtuosity will always have a noisy home, it means going back to an era that wasn't ashamed of its abilities and yet knew not to overplay it.  Toto personify that classification - no slouch players here.  Steve Lukather is a highly popular and influential axe slinger, who tours with the G3 lineup, a showcase for the best in the business.<br />  \\"IV\\" pushed Toto over the top once again, following a slight dip after \\"Hydra\\", which, while a fine album, had only \\"99\\" as a single.  \\"Rosanna\\" and \\"Africa\\" are radio stalwarts for good reason.  The rest of the CD gives more of the same, with David Paich, Steve Porcaro and Lukather creating a great sound that in lesser more selfish hands would spill over to overkill territory, ala Yes or ELP.  With an ear for jazz influence and just plain rocking out, Toto get it just right.  One personal fave is \\"Waiting For Your Love\\", a very cool vamp that wouldn't have been out of place on any jazz great record from Miles Davis, Wes Montgomery or other jazz giants.  For fans who demand more than just whining.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|This show is truely amazing. I'm so bummed that it was canclled! Anyway, the third season of Veronica Mars picks up after the suicide of Cassidy Casablancas, when Veronica and the gang head off to college. The thing is, in the second season, there is no mention of what college anyone is going to except Wallice, who was going to Hearst College. All in all, it's a great show, and you won't be dissapointed!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I was a big Six Feet Under fan and was anxious to see what Michael C. Hall's next project was going to be.  Dexter is a fitting follow up to showcase Hall's brilliant acting skills.  He manages to make the impossible possible by giving a serial killer likable qualities that create a sympathy for his \\"hobby.\\"  We've all seen the worst of the worst escape justice and hoped they would get theirs in the end.  Dexter feeds that dark place that wishes the guilty who are acquitted get what's coming to them.  The ice truck killer plot was just mind blowing and I didn't see the ending coming.  This series is amazing and would be a killer addition to your DVD collection.  (Insert collective groan...sorry!)
1582701709|1.0|Wow. The Secret is severely off-the-mark. If you buy it, you're just contributing to someone else's get-rich-quick scheme (and man - Ms. Byrne must be rolling in it after the success of this book). This book/DVD will not get you anywhere.    My biggest objection is to the absolute materialism of this book - how many people do you know who are happy because they have a big house and a fancy car? And don't think that by reading this that you will get there. It will teach you that if you stare at a big, fancy necklace in the jewelry store long enough (wasting much valuable time you could be using doing something actually productive!) that Prince Charming will magically appear, sweep you off your feet, and (without even having to ask you what you wanted) give you that amazing million-dollar necklace. How absolutely far-fetched. The book is about visualization - this is nothing novel. But visualizing becoming a millionaire is like praying to God that a million dollars will fall out of the sky for you. We all know that is not the point of prayer - or visualization! You have to be proactive, not just sit around visualizing a materialistic miracle, to get somewhere!    The theory that all bad things happen because you asked for it is also a ridiculous concept. Like the previous poster noted, do the victims of terrible wrongs (like genocide, slavery, or huge natural disasters) \\"bring it on\\"? How about a rapist - should that person get off the hook because the victim somehow attracted the negative act? This is just horrific. I truly cannot believe that people are buying this product to support this philosophy.    The \\"experts\\" who supposedly understand the Secret (which, for those of you who are wondering, consists of envisioning what you want and thinking positively - yes, that's all - and then getting what you want, no matter how ridiculous) and their credibility are questionable. A metaphysician?? Seriously guys!    The Secret will get you nowhere except poorer from the purchase, while padding Ms. Byrne's already loaded pockets.

B0000787FH|4.0|Elvis has long admitted to being a Beatles fan, of course (going as far as calling them the greatest band ever in Rolling Stone). And this is the closest he got to embracing the Fab Four's occasional dipping into \\"classical rock\\" (that is, rock influenced by classical music - I'm not trying to invent a new phrase for \\"classic rock\\"). The result is an odd, but mostly satisfying effort. I say \\"mostly\\" because sometimes he goes totally overboard in places, making You Little Fool, Town Cryer, Pidgin English and ...And Every Home sound treacly, overloading them with harpsichord, strings, Baroque piano, flutes, clarinets, bassoons, lutes, hautboys, kazoos... (okay, I made a couple of those up).<br />Overproduced? Well, yeah. But that's part of its charm, I guess you could say. And more often than not it's a classic: Take the cynical Beyond Belief or the ballads Almost Blue and Man Out of Time. Shabby Doll, Tears Before Bedtime and The Long Honeymoon (which has the only accordion part I've ever heard that I can honestly say I like) aren't as prominent as those three, but they have the same feel and are just as good. And Costello's lyricism and immortal melodicism are diminished.<br />However, there are at least two better Costello records out there. Maybe three. My favorite Elvis albums are the first three (and this one), and I can honestly say at least This Year's Model and Armed Forces (and probably My Aim is True) are better. So this is quite good, but don't start here.
1582701709|1.0|This book is a basic regurgitation of the far SUPERIOR book \\"Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill.  <br />  <br />Of course it was repackaged, dumbed down for the stupid crowd.

It's the Law of Attraction!   <br />  <br />I'm a capatalist, so I wish the makers of this book all the money+success in the world. I just don't like the marketing behind it. Tell me something I don't already know.  <br />  <br />I read complaints about \\"previsualization\\", and how if you \\"wish\\" for things long enough you'll get them. It's not supposed to be taken literally. There is some footwork involved.  <br />  <br />I recommend \\"Think and Grow Rich\\", and \\"Law of Success\\", both by Napoleon Hill. I reccommend both 21st century versions, for those that can't adapt the text from the earlier editions.
B0007R4TAS|3.0|It looks like it was copied from a very old VHS tape. Lots of lines running through it, and horrible splicing in places.  I guess for $4.99, you get what you pay for.  What made it worse was that you could tell at one time the original must have been awesome.  Other than the DVD quality, the movie was good..though not my favorite version.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Horrible is about the only word for this album.  I heard they had over 100 songs to choose for this cd, and these are what they chose?  It felt like I was back in the 80's for a few songs, clapping in the background and everything...rubbish.
0789420708|5.0|After finishing the original text of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" my 6 yo child was begging for me to read the story to her. When searching for a version which would suitable for her I came across a copy of the DK Eyewitness Classic at our local public library. It was a hit with our child! The text is a close adaptation of the original text. Throughout the book there are sprinklings of historical facts which are linked to the story through \\"eyewitness\\" encounters. At the end of the book is a historical section which deals with the particular time period the story takes place. Plus there is a full page biography of the author. This is a fantastic way to introduce your children to classic literature.
0316010669|3.0|Can non-fiction be well written, beautifully researched, entertaining and informative without succeeding in making it's case?  If you've read Malcolm Gladwell's Blink, your answer is very likely to be affirmative. By Blink, Gladwell is referring to your first impression. Call it intuition (he won't); call it thin slicing (he does); his thesis is that first impressions can tell you much more about a subject than a lot of extra thought can. Never mind sleeping on a subject, or studying it; go with your instincts, first impression; go with your first blink. To make his case, Gladwell starts with some really good examples. He cites art experts that can pick out a well- engineered fraud in an instant. Then there's the military expert who uses quick thinking to defeat a superior force in a blink. By about a third of the way through the book, you'll be thinking, now this guy is on to something. But, alas, as you get into it, the examples get weaker. Doubt sets in. Indeed, some later examples completely refute his original organizing hypothesis that first impressions are more valid than too much analysis. Finally, in his nice conversational style, Gladwell cites several examples of policemen, who, in stressful situations, racially stereotype. What? It seems here the rule reverses: Don't jump to conclusions. At that point, you'll be saying Huh! By the last chapter, you'll be wondering if maybe they should change the title from Blink to Think.

B0009RCPY8|5.0|I remember seeing these movies years ago when I was just a young tyke and now with the purchase of this double-feature pack, I can watch them whenever I want.    As always when watching films again when you are older, you catch things you may have missed due to the innocent mind of being a child.  Such is the case with these movies.  The comedic timing from the entire cast is right on point and will hve you stitches from the beginning until the very end.    Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis, and Rick Moranis are absolute comic geniuses in these movies.  I find the more subtle jokes and humor a bit more appealing as it seems that these are the jokes intended for adults, while the general story is geared toward children.  Also, I was never aware that the role of Dana Barret was played by Sigourney Weaver, who is not only amazingly stunning in these films, but also holds her own in the comedy department against the guys.    The double-feature pack doesn't have many extras, but in my mind you can't beat the price and its worth it just for the movies themselves.  If you don't have this pack, get it as soon as possible if you are like me and have been a fan of the ghostbusters since childhood.
0385522401|5.0|The many reviewers who have typified this book as symbolic of the \\"sexual revolution\\" of the 1960s are shortchanging McEwan's abilities as an observer and writer.  He has managed to compress the life stories of two people within a meagre framework.  The economy of his prose is only matched by his skill in conveying how two people develop into adults.  That adulthood sits uncomfortably on both.  Young, inexperienced and hestitant, McEwan's characters stand out as living refutations of 1960s stereotypes.  As a testimonial to excellent writing, this book is without peer.<br /><br />McEwan uses the setting of two people on their wedding night to weave an account of the post-war era.  The pair were born at WWII's conclusion, but came to maturity in turbulent  times.  On the one hand, the long-standing British Empire was coming apart at the seams.  India had already departed and African and Caribbean nations were struggling to follow suit.  It was a time of seemingly great instability.  On the other hand, it was also the age of John F. Kennedy.  Kennedy seemed to offer fresh promise and the British people developed an ambition to follow that path.  That attitude of hope was imbued in both Edward and Florence.  Both, from vastly different backgrounds, groped through their young lives for means to depart from the norms they experienced as children.  They have little tie to the \\"old values\\", but have only the vaguest notion of what new ones they should adopt.  Britain, long in thrall of a class system, might cast off the shackles of conformity.  Edward and Florence aren't truly aware of this shift in society, are inexperienced and fumbling in their sense of experiment.  Both are aware of what they think they want from life, but neither is truly cognisant of the other's aims.  Indeed, the two are so caught up in a vision of their future lives that they fail to comprehend each other.  It's a scene set for tragedy.<br /><br />The tragedy occurs, of course.  Regrettably, it occurs over one of the most fundamental aspects of life - especially married life.  Neither understands the adjustments two people living together must make.  Florence has never had a person to share intimacies with, and she feels wholly alone until this night.  Edward has been swept along by the male bombast about real or imagined associations with girls.  Lacking the forceful personality that might have allowed him to use his looks as a weapon for conquest, he's remained alone, limited to what boys do who cannot bring themselves to chance romantic adventures.  He's come to the conclusion that marriage will lead automatically to connubial bliss.  He's not the first to suffer such disappointment, but with Florence, the flawed outlook turns into a catastrophe.<br /><br />This is not a book to take lightly.  Its brevity can be deceiving.  The attentive reader, however, will discern McEwan possesses a singular ability to build characters.  \\"No man [or woman] is an island\\" the saying goes.  McEwan, however, knows how individuals can build their own worlds until circumstances force a more global outlook.  If they aren't prepared to enter that wider environment or lack someone who can ease them into it, the result can be a quick withdrawal.  It's like the story of the reseacher dropping a fly into the centre of a spider's web.  The spider simply flees.  Florence, who has woven a web of insecurity around herself, also takes flight.  Can Edward bring her back from her escape?  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]he most fundamental aspects of life - especially married life.

B000002LK1|5.0|What can I say about Violator that hasn't already beem said here? As my title says, it is the best album of all time, and of course the best album of all time should be done by the best band ever, right? Every song on here is great, my favorites being Sweetest Perfection, Waiting For The Night, Enjoy The Silence, Blue Dress and Clean.<br /><br />Sweetest Perfection is just that...perfection. Everyone is used to the most perfect-looking man on Earth, Dave Gahan, being the sexy one in DM. But, Martin sings this song so seductively, that upon hearing this song when I first got this cd, I began not only admiring this man for his superb writing, but being absolutely smitten with him. It's dark, obsessive and downright sexy. Waiting For The Night is beautiful and otherworldly, and is sung by both Gahan amd Gore. Hearing their voices together (Dave sings this song softer than he's ever sang on any other song)is absolutely heavenly.<br /><br />Enjoy The Silence is perfect. The writing, vocals, and production are so far above anything that anyone else has done, it's astounding. I don't care what genre of music you're into, you'll love this song. Blue Dress is gorgeous and moving, but kinky...only Martin Gore can pull off writing and singing a song like this. I literally cried upon hearing this...this song is tied with \\"Question Of Lust\\" off of \\"Black Celebration\\", as my favorite song. \\"Clean\\" is primal, dark and heavy, with a tribal sounding beat. It is the perfect way to close the album, and my god, if you haven't seen this video, PLEASE pull it up on YouTube...all I have to say is Martin, pretty girl, couch. I nearly passed out when I saw it!
B000EXDS5M|5.0|I have loved this movie since I saw it at the drive-in when I was a kid. I watched it on t.v. over the years and felt sad as the film seemed to age.<br />The dvd was such a pleasant surprise, the picture was great/the colors were crisp. Even the sound seemed clearer and more brilliant. The interviews were so wonderful-I was so absorbed in all of the splendor.<br />As a kid, I decided that my favorite scene was the mountain scene (when Butch and Sundance are being chased by the law). I always laugh when Butch says, \\"The fall will probably kill you!\\" and then they both jump.<br />I am the author of-[[ASIN:1432702033 Dreams in August: Life, Love, and Cerebellar Ataxia]]
B000000WZ4|5.0|Ultra is a nice cd to listen to in a mellow mood on a quiet day. With the exception of \\"Barrel of A Gun\\" and \\"Useless\\", Ultra remains for the most part moody and ambient. While it isn't Violator or SOFAD, it is still great. The standouts on this album are Barrel Of A Gun (you absolutely MUST see this video), Sister Of Night, which is startlingly beautiful, The Bottom Line, sung by Martin Gore, who sounds sensual and absolutely flawless, and Home. Home, also sung by Gore, is a gorgeous, heartfelt, honest song. I literally sat in the car and cried upon hearing this song for the first time. It is a surreal and moving experience.<br /><br />I would definitely suggest buying this album...though if you are new to DM, buy The Singles 86-98 first. That was my starter album, and now I own every single DM cd.
1596912855|5.0|As an adult fan of Shannon Hale's young adult books (The Goose Girl, Enna Burning, River Secrets, and Newbery Honor book Princess Academy), it is fun to see her ply her considerable talent to lighter fare. This is a very different voice from her lyrical fantasies. Austenland is sassy, fresh, and smart, with engaging dialog and brilliant comic timing.     Jane, the main character, who goes on a three-week Austen-themed vacation in an attempt to kick her Colin-Firth-as-Mister-Darcy habit, is caught between the allure of empire waist gowns and men in breeches and her resolve to distill from the experience something real. She is surrounded by a delightful cast of funny (sometimes hysterical) supporting characters. I laughed out loud. And giggled. I actually giggled. I immensely enjoyed this delightful book.    But Austenland is not for everyone. It might not be for you if a) you are an Austen purist and believe that Jane Austen's name and works are sacred, b) you don't care much for Colin Firth, c) you are quite young (the book's intended for adults), or d) you haven't much by way of a sense of humor.
B00005JLCI|5.0|I had the opportunity to see this film during limited premiere back in December 25, 1996.  I still have the program from that time.  The 3 theatres to have the honors were The Paris Theatre in New York, The Royal Theatre in Los Angeles and The York Theatre in Toronto.  These theatre showed the film in its entirety with one intermission of about 10 minutes.  When it went nationwide the following January 24, 1997, it was edited and shorten by about 1 hour.<br /><br />I must say, watching it for the first time was exciting.  The film was amazing and I was intrigue throughout.  Keep in mind I was still a young high school student when I first saw this.  I enjoyed every aspect of it and did not want to see it end.  When the film was first released on DVD or LD, I rented it and it was still good but there is nothing like experiencing it at the theatre and presented the way it was meant to be seen.
B000FJA1BO|5.0|This slim account of the quixotic life and tragic death of Chris McCandless is a remarkable book. I was transfixed by this story, one that chronicled the wanderings and explorations of a young man across the American West and into the wild of the Alaskan interior.          I found the book moved me in ways I hardly expected. This is surely a testament to the skilled and sensitive writing of Krakauer. He was able to transport me into the beauty and terror of this man's trek through desert, mountains, and taiga. I am an urban creature, who only on occasion has traveled the guided trail in a state park. Yet, I was swept along in the wake of McCandless's more exotic and often times harrowing trails through places like Detrital Wash, Arizona, Carthage, South Dakota and Stampede Trail, Alaska. As detailed an eye Krakauer has in making the flora and fauna of the West come alive for the reader, it is the human story of yearning and loss that made this much more than a tale of man alone in the wilderness.         Krakauer could have sold many copies of this story without probing the depths and mysteries of Chris McCandless's life. Instead, the author served up a complex potrtrait of a young man in his 20s estranged from his parents and hell bent on his search for truth and an unfettered life free from his suburban Washington D.C. upbringing and the rules and regulations of modern society. This story easily could have lapsed into a cliched tale of another On the Road Kerouac figure or a latter day Thoreau seeking self-discovery. While there are elements of these types in the character of McCandless, Krakauer draws a much more complex and compelling person for us to ponder.           At times I wanted to shake McCandless and tell him what the hell was he doing abrubtly leaving his family and cutting off all ties with former friends as he sought a purer, freer life. How self-absorbed and typically adolescent of him to be so wrapped up in his own angst to ignore the friendsand family he left behind. Yet, as Krakauer deftly demonstrates McCandless was capabale of great compassion and a sense of responsibility when he met up with a variety of characters along the way.         I was especially moved by the tender and caring relationship fostered between him and an 80 year old man in the desert of the Southwest. McCandeless engendered affection, concern, and endearment in a lonely soul still grieving for his own son killed in an automobile accident. The fact that McCandless has to move on and leave behind the offers of emotional and financial assistance evokes more pathos than anger in the reader. Time and time again McCandless has a beguiling charm on the people he meets and the caring relationships he makes in the borderlands of the West.  At these moments I wanted to hug McCandless and be a brother to him, affriming his need to explore and search while also reminding him that people need him and he needs the human community despite all of its shortcomings.          Yet, McCandless seems destined to go his own way, ignoring both the advice of seasoned travellers he meets along the way as well as the  admomishments of the readers of this story such as myself who begin to deeply care for this person. It is heart wrenching to read about McCandless's final days in the Alaskan wilderness, holed up in an abandoned school bus with his copy of Tolstoy by his side as he slowly starves to death. By this point I could no longer be frustrated with all of McCandless's mistakes and shortcomings. Rather, I was left with a profound sense of loss for a gifted and troubled soul, who with a little bit of luck, could have make it back to the human society he so needed to escape. The tragic irony is that McCandless seemed to have wanted to make that return journey, but the natural wild he had so embraced would not let him go.         In the end this story's power lies in its ability to force each of us to reflect upon the paths we have taken in life, especially those of us who have done our own share of self- righteous rebellion against parents and society. While McCandless was his own person and surely belied easy pop psychology labels, his tragic death and the nuanced story Krakauer tells makes one pause and take stock of the choices each of us have made in our life.

0743270754|5.0|Every parent should encourage his or her child to read at least one biography of Lincoln and this would be an outstanding choice.  Goodwin's masterpiece portrays Lincoln's unarguable greatness.  No other American life is so inspirational, in my estimation.  Lincoln's commitment to the ideal of saving the nation and emancipating the slaves, often in the face of withering personal criticism, is staggering in its nobility. Although I am politically poles apart from Goodwin, I heartily salute her scholarship in this instance and her ability to tell such an epic story in a manner that touches the reader's heart as well as his brain.  Her book is truly a tour de force and should be read by all Americans.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of classical music, but many of the songs in this soundtrack melted my heart. :) Some were not *that* good, but some were just very incredible, which makes it worth five stars !
B000000OQF|5.0|THE BAND: William \\"Axl\\" Rose (vocals, synth, percussion), Saul \\"Slash\\" Hudson (guitars), Izzy Stradlin - born: Jeff Isbell (guitars), Michael \\"Duff\\" McKagan (bass), Steven Adler (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1987) 12 tracks clocking in at approximately 53 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, all original album artwork, and thank you's. Recorded at Rumbo Studios (Canoga Park, CA), Take One Studios (Burbank, CA) and Can Am Studios (Tarzana, CA). Label - Geffen Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Some good music was released by some well known bands in 1987 - Aerosmith (a nice comeback with \\"Permanent Vacation\\"), Def Leppard (\\"Hysteria\\"), Motley Crue (\\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\"), Dokken (\\"Back For The Attack\\"), and Whitesnake (self titled - featuring John Sykes), etc. But the one album that made the most impact was \\"Appetite For Destruction\\". Just another album from a glammy tattooed L.A. hair band? No chance. The music was instantly cool... fusing elements of hard rock, blues and metal into one... full of crunchy guitars, attitude, catchy hooks, and vocals like no other. GN'R's debut is the 4th highest selling album of the entire 80's decade (15+ million units sold in the U.S. alone... only behind Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\", AC/DC's \\"Back In Black\\", and Springsteen's \\"Born In The USA\\"); and Rolling Stone magazine currently ranks it at #61 on their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Rose and Slash had a much publicized feud (and 20 years later are still at it)... and the band imploded in the mid 90's. A short life with one incredibly solid debut album, some odd leftovers on \\"GN'R Lies\\" (1988), two good albums in '91 with \\"Use Your Illusion I & II\\" (though had they taken the best songs from each and put them on one album - it would have rivaled \\"Appetite For Destruction\\"), and a bunch of covers on \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\" (1993). The band entered the music world with a ferocious bang, and the fizzled away without much noise. \\"Appetite\\" reminds me of one of my all-time favorite albums - Aerosmith \\"Rocks\\" (1976) - full of style, swagger, and simply great rock & roll music... destined to be a classic. The group successfully re-energised the genre in the late 80's with shameless gusto. The album gained momentum slowly - and exactly one year after its release, reached #1 on the Billboard charts. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" became a #1 single and proved to be the album's selling point. \\"Paradise City\\" was the band's 2nd Top 10 hit. And after being re-released, \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" achieved the same Top 10 status. As good as the 3 big hits here were, the rest of the album rocked on almost the same level. The 1st 9 songs are/were amazing and I put the deep album tracks right up there with the hits - \\"It's So Easy\\", \\"Nightrain\\", \\"Mr. Brownstone\\", \\"Think About You\\", and \\"My Michelle\\" are all classic GN'R tunes. Only 2 things negative regarding this album and GN'R - 1. the tail end of the album (specifically \\"You're Crazy\\", \\"Anything Goes\\" and \\"Rocket Queen\\") seemed to be a bit of a let down... I wish the album ended with a bigger bang; and 2. Axl Rose's antics on and off stage were disappointing. With that being said though, you simply can't deny the music on this album.

B000AL730O|5.0|Listening to Memory Almost Full encouraged me to buy this album.<br /><br />Who can you compare McCartney to except himself, a tough comparison for anyone...except McCartney.<br /><br />The more you listen to this, the more you are drawn into his magical world of gardens that stretch out for miles and English Tea, and deep and inspiring love. If you are like me, you will notice why he is arguably the greatest melodic composer of modern times, perhaps ever.<br /><br />English Tea is the type of song only McCartney would write.  You gave me the answer meets Country Garden with piano and musical overtones reminiscent of In My Life.<br /><br />Jenny Wren is one of his mysterious story songs.  Was she perhaps a famous singer?<br /><br />A certain softness is a shimmering gem, an atmospheric smouldering acoustic latin jazzy number. I could just imagine myself looking into a woman's eyes, feeling quite fascinated, more than I ever thought I could, in a room with hushed lighting, an intimate setting full of promise.  Maybe its just me. He uses really captivating infills with piano, and classical guitar. Press repeat. Edly.<br /><br />I am not a soppy romantic but when he sings Follow Me-You hold up a sign which reads, Follow Me - which is one of the best love songs he has written, perfect for a wedding, I just wanted to cry. The triumph of experience over hope.  Its from such a deep and moving emotional place, and quite simply, one of his best.  Press repeat.<br /><br />I have been playing this album consistently since I bought it. This is one of his best solo works.  I can pick out something new each time.  The dramatic way that Follow Me builds to climax, extending the chorus, and adding harmony, and layering.  The trademark harmonies.  Sometimes he doubletracks his vocals, and harmonises himself like on Eleanor Rigby.  Sometimes this is so subtle you don't notice it on first listen.  An album McCartney can be proud of.  He fills his own shoes pretty well.  Others compare this album to Ram, or Band on the Run. Its way better than Ram.ter than Ram.
B00006ADD5|5.0|There is no way that enough could be said about the film \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\"  Based loosely on Lawrence's book \\"Revolt in the Desert,\\" which is an abridged version of \\"Seven Pillars of Wisdom.\\"  This is the definitive classic film from a transitional time just before salacious movies became the norm.  It is to director David Lean's credit that he chose patently unknown actors (at the time) for his key roles that truly made this film soar.  The fact that they performed so exceptionally is a testament to the professionalism and dedication of those actors.  The contributions of \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" to future films are seen to this day in the cinematographic techniques and  similar shots in recent films.  Compared to Lawrence's books, the film, by virtue of its medium can never capture the Shakespearean quality language that T.E. Lawrence possessed.  If any book parallels the film it would be Lowell Thomas's 1925 book, \\"With Lawrence in Arabia,\\" that recounts the journalist's experience as an \\"imbedded\\" reporter with Lawrence.  Thomas is often credited with spreading the stories of Lawrence's Arabian exploits that made him so popular in the west.  A simply brilliant film on par with Lean's \\"Bridge on the River Kwai.\\" A motion picture nearly as remarkable as the man himself.

0385522401|3.0|\\"On Chesil Beach: A Novel\\" by Ian McEwan starts out with a small fib in the title..[me thinks].  It really is a very small book; more a novella.  What it lacks in size; it packs in detail and powerful images of the 60s when things were a little different than they are today.  People were not only different but the pace of life was slower and more filled with a dedication to a \\"certain path\\" in life...all preordained by family, friends, community and morality.<br /><br />McEwan focuses on these restrictions and blockages which were part of that decade's expectations for its young; and what their future lives should entail.  The book explores those expectations that the world had for its young and the rules dictating these accepted outcomes.  There did not seem to be any written guidebook or great self-help book(s) in the \\"good ole days\\" to help the timid accept their fate or their destiny depending upon how one looked at it.  Where was Doctor Phil back then?<br /><br />You were just expected to \\"take the plunge\\" and \\"figure it out\\" as you went along.  That is just what happened to Florence and to Edward.  Unfortunately, they didn't end up figuring it out together; they unraveled their misgivings, pride and hurt...years later, while alone.<br /><br />McEwan, as always, is in complete control of his novel and its many details.  But something is lacking in the characters of Florence and Edward which is never realized.  I felt that the novella as a whole lacked that purpose and direction that other novels by McEwan owned and directed.<br /><br />Since I am a McEwan fan, I have become increasingly disappointed in this master stylist.  I was slightly disappointed first in the book Saturday and now even more than a little disappointed in On Chesil Beach.  The characters were not believable; at least, they did not resonate with me.

B000OYC3J8|4.0|Let me preface this by saying that The White Stripes are the only band worth caring about these days.  They are the only group around that you have to pick up the album the day it comes out.  I heard Icky Thump on the radio and was licking my chops for the potential of this album.  Kinda like Blue Orchid was for Satan.  I'm not saying this album is a disappointment by any means, but I'm a little disappointed that its more Jack White the producer than Jack White innovative musician.      The White Stripes albums are usually stripped down and that's what I dig about them.  I didn't want this to necessarily be De Stijl but more of a return to Elephant which it is.  But the album lacks the empty spaces and feel of other Stripes works.  I have a feeling they got in their big new studio and tried tying everything together really nicely rather than letting the chips fall where they may.  As an example, the instrumental bridge on \\"A Martyr\\" couldn't exist without some help.  The album is a return to LOUD though which is also welcome, but its just a tad too overproduced for my liking.  The White Stripes seemingly were the ONLY group that didn't have to rely on Pro Tools but it appears they've embraced it with Icky Thump.    Key Tracks:  Rag and Bone, Conquest, Effect and Cause, 300 MPH Outpour Blues, You Don't Know What Love Is
B000P2A24W|5.0|Bon Jovi a band that has brought us great (and sometimes just average) music for over 20 years. I had wondered if \\"Lost Highway\\" would hit the mark or just miss it. Well, I have listened and I can only say...........  W O W ! ! ! !  This CD shows how Bon Jovi has ALWAYS had just a touch of country in their music. Yes, it may have been cranked up to 11 on some of their guitar amps before, but Richie has always had just a touch of the country note bends in his finest solos. The music has always had great musical lines (chord progressions for you musical students) and now that magical touch is just a touch better. Jon's vocals have always had a great earthy edge in them that is completely at home in the country genre.<br /><br />But I have to tell you: THIS IS NOT YOUR FATHER'S COUNTRY MUSIC. This is country music like Keith Urban, or Kenny Chesney. In other words it is still rock music that Bon Jovi is playing.  It's just that now it has the slightest additional touch of country. A better acoustic guitar sound here, a distant steel guitar there, and a couple of great country duets.<br /><br />But I DARE YOU to tell me that \\"We Got It Going On\\" wouldn't work great at a rock concert. Big & Rich brought their ROCK flair to this great party song, Another great party song is the closing number, \\"I Love This Town\\"<br /><br />I can't tell you enough: 1) This is the BEST Bon Jovi CD released in the last 15 years and 2) Forget the label \\"country\\" and just put it in your player, baby. This rocks with style and passion.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear this in concert.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|Critics generally describe this as a comedy about a dysfunctional family. It isn't that at all; it's a biting critique of a dysfunctional society.<br /><br />The family is actually the only source of support and solace available to the beleagered individuals depicted in the film as they each strive--and painfully fail to reach--the pinnacle of the American Dream: the top spot, the \\"winner.\\"<br /><br />The banality of this goal is ruthlessly satirized as the movie progresses. Every conceivable form of American Success with a Capital S is savagely revealed as distorting and empty.<br /><br />The wholesome Dad swears under his breath as his dream of a motivational-speaker-writer empire crumbles before him; his family is disgusted by his hollow cheerleader motivational patter--the soundtrack, if you will, of the American Dream.<br /><br />The acerbic grandfather shoots heroin to control his various aches and pains, and rudely defines success as having sex with as many women as possible (hey, it worked for JFK, Bill Clinton and innumerable \\"sports heroes\\")--a crass, unwholesome portrayal of the \\"real American Dream\\"-- or at least the male one.<br /><br />The harried, chain-smoking mother is frayed by the insuperable demands of holding the family together while she puts fast-food on the table and rescues her mentally unstable brother.<br /><br />Her brother, an openly gay aspiring academic superstar, is suicidal because another academic has replaced him as the number one Proust scholar--and snagged his gay lover to boot.<br /><br />The son, who has taken a vow of silence to express his open hatred of his family, single-mindedly works out in order to achieve his goal of being accepted to the Air Force Academy and becoming a pilot. His dreams are dashed by a weakness beyond his control, and he is inconsolable.<br /><br />The slightly chubby daughter pursues her dream of winning a sickeningly saccharine talent contest in California, \\"Little Miss Sunshine.\\" Despite its wholesome veneer, the entire contest is deeply subversive of childhood, a bizarre distortion in which girls are made up to look like small adult women and perform \\"Miss America\\" type song-and-dance routines.<br /><br />The daughter's painfully bawdy routine--a searing exaggeration of the contest's subtext of pushing adulthood onto little girls--draws predictable howls of outrage from the contest authorities, and rallies the family to her side.<br /><br />When Granddad unexpectedly passes away, the American bureaucracy takes a mirthful beating as the family is forced to sneak the body out of the hospital and load it in their decrepit VW van.<br /><br />Though other bits of American life get similarly skewered, the key satire is of The American Dream of being a \\"winner\\".

B0006GANN2|1.0|As with most movies based on real life, this movie is a poor recreation of the original.  The real French connection refers to a trans-Atlantic heroin trade with roots in the Cold War, organized crime and the CIA.  The history begins in the 1950's.  As the Iron Curtain descends on Eastern Europe, communist parties throughout the rest of Europe make gains in local and national politics.  Their rise is most noticeable in France where they poll well in elections.  In response, the US CIA allies itself with members of France's organized crime network to undermine the French communists in ways both illegal (by both French and American laws) and immoral.  The CIA gets willing henchmen in France, and in exchange they turn a blind eye towards other illicit activities such as heroin smuggling.  Some believe the CIA even aided the drug trade, but this is still a point of contention.  The heroin smuggled from the Port of Marseilles arrives in East coast cities such as New York.  One major effect is the corruption of the New York Police Department.    This movie leaves out the CIA, the Cold War fight, and even the police corruption, and focuses solely on the contact and ensuing conflict between several of the heroin smugglers and two US cops, Buddy and Popeye.  The former is careful, by-the-books, and honest.  The latter is reckless, brutal, violent, and a womanizer.  When released, this movie was groundbreaking in the level of violence involved, bad language, its depiction of police life and police officers (Popeye's character), and was probably the first major movie to revolve around the international drug trade.  Watching it now in the 21st movie, the movie is quite boring.  The dialog is meager in quantity and poor in quality.  The violence is actually tame.  The car chase scenes were soon surpassed in excitement by those in the Blues Brothers (1980).  The character development is minimal and the portrayal of the criminal life is also minimal.  Even the archetypal relationship between the reckless cop and the by-the-books cop has been recreated better in movies such as Training Day and Lethal Weapon.  In fact, the movie seems to be one long series of gunfights between good guys and bad guys.  It sure says a lot about movie quality back in the early 1970s if this movie could get so many Academy Awards.  Not worth the time to watch it or the money to rent/buy it.
0790733226|5.0|The type of movie I love.  It is scifi, rich in mystery!  The beginning is very slow.  When I watch it now I skip right to the beginning of the action.  From there the movie flys.  You are truly kept looking for the next clue, the next answer.  You want to find out what this is all about.  They could have done something different with the conclusion, but I liked the change in the main characters outlook.
B000PFUAO6|2.0|I simply don't have the ears for these lyrics.  I would have been happy if this was just an instrumental album.  I really respect the band, musicianship and all the hard work.  I've got absolutely no memorable moments listening to this album.  Nothing stands out or grabs my attention other then how sick I am of listening to religious lyrical content.  Instead of Parental Warnings there should be one for explicit use of religious undertones (whether you're singing about your own, or someone else's).  I started having flash backs of the \\"Take away my pain\\" song ... stop writing cry-baby lyrics.
630460288X|4.0|Actually a very good story, with only one portion being a stretch; do you really think you can control someone you've turned into a killing machine???<br /><br />What happens when that killing machine is frozen and thawed centuries into the future by someone who wants to use him and his thugs to control society?<br /><br />What happens when a cop wrongly convicted is also frozen, then thawed to stop the killing machine???  Thats your movie.<br /><br />Sometimes you just need to see a good kick B**t scene and this movie has one in particular, when Wesley Snipes is confronted at a telphone booth by the local police.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|But if you're a fan you'll probably like some of it anyway. Some great musicianship as usual. Sounds rather un-inspired. Fairly good sound quality and engineering. A little flat.

B000FIMG68|4.0|If you loved Season One, and even if not, Season Two will keep you hooked.    PREVIOUSLY ON LOST - by the end of last season, the survivors of Ft. 815 reached a crisis.  Locke blew off the top of the mysterious hatch using barely stable dynamite (as it ages, TNT \\"sweats\\" nitroglycerin, and the stuff that Jack and Locke find looks like it spent a few years on a treadmill), but finds more mystery within.  Michael, Walt, Jin and Sawyer, having escaped on Michael's raft, encounter another boat.  Elation quickly turns to terror - Walt is taken and the others are cast adrift.  We knew that the survivors were not alone, but we learn how \\"The Others\\" are powerful, determined and unfriendly.      In Season 2, we meet more survivors.  We also learn more about the mysterious and hostile \\"Others\\" - but are we really learning the truth?  (After a season, we already know not to believe everything we see.)  If you loved Hurley's spotlight story last season, there's a great sequel.  And of course we finally go down into the mysterious hatch, where some questions are answered, but many more raised.  \\"Lost\\" is a lot like The Hatch, keeping us going by showing us just enough - no captain's log, no tell-all tricorders, no voice-overs.  Comfy closure is for \\"Grey's Anatomy\\".  This is a show for viewers who like a challenge.  The season ends almost perfectly - without giving away too much, there's a perfectly paced climax that weaves themes and backstories of several characters, and sets the stage for Season Three.    ARE YOU LOST?  \\"Lost follows the unfortunate survivors of Oceanic 815.  Stranded on a mysterious island, they soon realize that quick rescue isn't likely as their flight had gone off-course for some distance prior to the crash.  Apart from the dangers of being on an unpopulated island, \\"Lost\\" added some new wrinkles - a crazy French woman named Danielle (whose voice plays on the recorded message picked up early last season), an invisible monster, a weird hatch barely buriedunderground and (above all dangers) the terrifying clues that our survivors are under attack.  \\"Lost\\" excels for the very reason usually used to explain why other shows fail - because it shifts gears quickly, from funny to sad, sentimental to ominous.  The show doesn't overload you with surprises, but has no shortage of them.    But \\"Lost\\" is also great character drama - weaving the challenges of the island with the complex back-stories of individual characters, each of whome challenged our shallow perceptions them - Sawyer, the schemer; Jack, the doctor who fix anybody; Sayyid, the soldier; Charlie, the has-been rocker turned junky; Kate, the murderess; Locke, the visionary who seems oddly at home on the island; and Hurley, who gamely resists being the comic-relief of the show.  Each episode continued picking away at the past-lives of our characters, sometimes revisiting previously seen moments of their lives - making us wonder if they're better off being Lost for good.
0596527055|4.0|Scott Berkun's book is one that would be best paired with John Allen Paulos \\"Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences\\". Both are books not about the subject itself (innovation and math, respectfully) but about human reaction to it. In Paulos' case, it is how we simplify numbers and draw the wrong conclusions. In Berkun's case, it is how we \\"remember\\" how things come to be and draw the wrong conclusions.    In the book, Berkun reviews several \\"myths\\" of innovation. The myths are mostly human short cuts our minds take to help either a) process information or b) transmit the information to other people. We humans constantly simply the complex for reasons only understood in deep neurological science. Berkun could have just as easily written a very similar book on national polices (look at heath care), education, or marriage.    It is good to remember the complexity and we do need to do that in the area of creativity. I found Berkun's style a bit hard to read. I had to go over many passages several times as the sentence constructs were difficult. This happened frequently when he was injecting some levity into the area. For the most part, it was easily digested and help pass a long plane fight.    I recommend the book for, if nothing else, it will remind you that the world is not as simple as we think it is.
B000NA28I4|1.0|This movie differed way too much from the book for me. I understand that some changes have to be made when a book is made into a movie, but this was way too much. From little details (Arya's hair colour) to the actual ENDING, changes were made. The movie would be good, but i couldn't enjoy it because i loved the book too much. If you read the book, don't bother buying, if you enjoy fantasy movies and haven't read the book or can get buy the huge changes, could be good. Thats my opinion anyway.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Having heard all the bad critical reviews when this film was in the theater I didn't go to see it.  Since I make it a point to see all Marvel movies I waited for it to come out on disc.  I wish I had seen it in the theater because it was a good film and I missed out on the special effects of seeing it on the big screen.    The beginning of the film is like a Twilight Zone episode as Johnny Blaze makes a deal with the devil to save his father.  Of course the deal comes with a catch.  Afterwards, Johnny is a servant of the devil called a Ghost Rider, to do his bidding.    Johnny loses touch with his girlfriend (Eva Mendez's younger sister?) and then meets up with her years later (Eva Mendez) as he is the star of an Evel Kneivel type stunt show and she is a reporter covering his daredevil jump.    To say any more of the plot would be a spoiler to those who haven't seen it, but the movie has some great special effects (Johnny riding his flaming motorcycle up and down the sides of buildings) and some surprisingly good supporting cast acting.  Sam Elliot, plays a mysterious grave digger who seems to know a lot about Johnny and ironically Peter Fonda who starred in all those motorcycle films is the devil.    The battle between good (or should I say semi-good) and evil is great as Johnny turns into an avenging demon at night when he is around evil.
1594489505|4.0|\\"Homeruns in Hollywood\\"    It's amazing when a new ball player, upon his first time up at bat in the professional league, hits a homerun.  It's spectacular, however, when at his second time at bat, he hits a grand slam.  Congratulations, Mr. Hosseini, on your grandslam!    Khaled Hosseini's second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, is even more riveting than his first, The Kite-Runner--which I loved.  He is a masterful storyteller.  The novel, centered upon the lives of two women, who become two of the most unlikely friends, portrays the struggles of the Afghani people, especially its women.  It is draped with forty years of Afghani politics; the politics, however, never weaves itself into the central plot.  Yet, the reader cannot escape the presence of such turbulent politics even as he/she reads about the simple household tasks--preparing food, ironing, cooking, etc.--that Mariam and Laila, the two female characters upon whom the novel focuses, perform.      Mariam and Laila are both married to the same--significantly older--man, the nefarious Rasheed.  Both women marry him prior to the Taliban takeover; neither does so out of love, but rather because of the cultural mores of their different generations.  Their situations signify the lack of power women had in Afghanistan even during the pre-Taliban era.  The women suffer the emotional and violent harm imposed upon them by Rasheed, and seek freedom, both marital and political.     Despite Rasheed's vitriolic nature, Hosseini does present him with a shimmer of humanity, giving the reader the hope that perhaps he won't be so bad.  At times, one might laugh at Rasheed's foibles or think that he might turn around.  This makes for a well-rounded character rather than simply a \\"bad guy.\\"      Hosseini also presents several good-natured men, which demonstrates realistically that, although women suffered at the hands of men, not all men are capable of such wickedness.  The reader cannot help but to revere, adore, and/or sympathize with all the women in the novel, save for, perhaps, a couple of them.  Hosseini's inclusion of cruel women furthers his realistic and accurate portrayal of humans and life.  Things aren't simply good or bad.    Yet given his ability to create such realism and subtleties, Hosseini fails to create an ending with the same elements.  Like in The Kite Runner, Mr. Hosseini, once again, ties up or resolves all matters that arise in his second novel.  Life, in the endings of both novels, seems to have an almost perfect feel to it, (which is not to give away the fates of the characters).  But, unfortunately, life isn't that way.  And for Hosseini's second novel, which portrays the harsh realities of such a beleaguered nation so well, it is too naïve a way to end it.  Mr. Hosseini, after all, is no naïve author.  Although much good is derived from the American invasion of Afghanistan, it is clear that resolutions, in that country, are still a long way away.  Mr. Hosseini's only attempt to capture the extreme precariousness of life in Afghanistan towards the end of the novel is weak.   For example, he refers to the possible re-emergence of the Taliban, a serious issue in Afghanistan.  But he brushes over it so quickly, that the threat is soon forgotten.  Perhaps, Mr. Hosseini felt that a novel that portrays such violence, melancholy, brutality, and pain requires some dose of equanimity.  If so, it is important to see that tying matters up so neatly for that reason or to boost sales is not fitting for an artist looking to portray the realities of life.  After all, Mr. Hosseini is brilliant at capturing his vision of Afghanistan and its women throughout the majority of the novel.  But his ending, most likely, leaves a lot of vultures in Hollywood lunging for the carrion and, thus, takes away some of the novel's artistic merit.    As a whole, though, the novel does portray a very realistic Afghanistan.  Some sections are difficult, emotionally, to read.  But it succeedsin keeping the reader fully engaged and involved; emotions are constantly in flux; suspense is heightened as each chapter ensues; and characters are drawn and developed clearly and believably.  Mr. Hosseini's style, using simple and lucid language, has the effect of heightening the atrocities in the novel.      Now that's a good writer.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This biopic tailor made for the family is a nice way to spend an evening at home.  It's sweet, dramatic, traumatic and overall delightfully charming.  It has almost every element you'd want in family entertainment.  It has a wonderful script and a stellar cast and the set designs were wonderfully crafted, able to cast a sense of mystery and fantasy while still carrying a touch of reality.  I myself have always been a fan on the biopic, and when that said biopic is done brilliantly, well then I can be found close to tears.  Let's just say that `Finding Neverland' is on the verge of heavenly in my boat.<br /><br />Following J.M. Barrie as he struggles to pick himself up from his last stage disaster, Depp does a wonderful job investing charm and humor in his character while still layering him with an apparent sadness.  He's fallen out of touch with his wife, played by the tragically underused Radha Mitchell.  His last few plays have been flops, and while he parades himself as the optimist on the outside Depp subtly allows us to see this man crumbling inside.  When Depp was first nominated for the Oscar I didn't quite get it, but after several viewings of this film I now understand.  His performance was understated and subtle, and in those subtleties he was able to breathe reality into J.M. Barrie.<br /><br />Just when writers block seems to have taken its hold of Barrie he runs into a young widow Sylvia, played by the iconic Kate Winslet, and her four young boys.  Barrie soon takes an attachment to the boys, and they to him, and it's in their fire that he finds inspiration for the play that made him a household name, Peter Pan.  Winslet's performance is probably the most difficult of the cast, and she pulls it off with flying colors.  She's able to evoke every emotion out of the audience without ever appearing overly needy or displaying a shred of self-pity.  Her character has only her children in mind even as she falls apart on the inside.  Like in Depps case, it's the subtlety in the performance that makes the character all the more real.<br /><br />Another highlight to the film is newcomer Freddie Highmore who plays Sylvia's more emotionally troubled son Peter.  His mature performance perfectly compliments those of the adult cast, and his tears in a few key scenes will mirror yours as you become emotionally invested in this young boy.<br /><br />The film beautifully captures the spirit of adolescence and shows the importance for children to have a father and for men to have children.  Even though Barrie was not a father himself, much less the father of the four boys that inspired him, the five of them needed each other and grew together because of it.  It's a wonderful family film complete with a stellar supporting cast as well including Dustin Hoffman and Julie Christie.  There are few films that both parents and children can enjoy, so when gems like this film arrive we do well to swoop in and devour them.e performance that makes the character all the more real.

B000M341QE|5.0|This is one of those movies that you have to watch two or three times to make sense of all the intense action. It is riveting and you can't take your eyes off the screen!<br /><br />I have been waiting for Leo Di Caprio to do a truly \\"manly\\" and tough role in a believable way, and this is the role. He is convincingly tough and does an incredible job in this movie. In my opinion Leo has been miscast in a number of films as a tough guy, most notably in Gangs of New York. He seems truly grown up in this movie.<br />Matt Damon is excellent, although as one of my favorite actors I hated to \\"love to hate\\" him in this morally degenerate role.<br />Jack Nicholson annoyed me. He does a great job, but I just found myself thinking that Daniel Day Lewis or Byrne, or someone of that ilk would have been a better choice for the role of Costello.<br />I did not understand the ending. Maybe after viewing several more times?...
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Despite the fact that `Ray' was just released the year prior to critical acclaim, even winning an Oscar or two, and the fact that the life story of Johnny Cash is in a way very similar the film `Walk the Line' does a brilliant job of making this life story all that much more compelling and entertaining than last years submission.  This is due in large part to the fantastic performances of the entire cast, most notably Joaquin Phoenix, Reese Witherspoon and the Oscar snubbed Ginnifer Goodwin who brilliantly balances support, frustration and sympathy as Cash's ex wife Vivian.  James Mangold has that same eye for detail as Hackford possessed in `Ray' but he ups the ante by fleshing out not only the demons that corrupted Cash's soul but also the angel that saved him in the end, notably June Carter.<br /><br />Right off the bat we are introduced to the Cash household and immediately the lines are drawn as in who the supportive parent and who the dominating overbearing parent is, and when the tragic death of Johnny's older brother shakes things up within that household no one is ever truly the same afterward.  Racked with guilt for not being there when he was hurt and or being the surviving sibling Johnny lived the majority of his life with suppressed grief and constant dissatisfaction with any of his many accomplishments.  The film beautifully flows through his adolescent life in the army, his early life married sweetheart Vivian and then the early points in his career until fame and fortune drove Johnny to drugs and, you guessed it, women.<br /><br />But it was one woman who stole his heart and cured his soul, and that was June Carter, played brilliantly by Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon.  Her charisma, charm and sincerity helped tame a tortured man and gave him reason to believe in himself and in the prospect of living a happy and fulfilling life once and for all.  The film chronicles their love affair from its rocky start, shaky middle and everlasting end and it does so with such elegance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.  Phoenix is a force to be reckoned with as he attacks Cash's very being with such reverence and determination that I felt I witnessed the birth of a true star, and Witherspoon earned her Oscar with the same fiery determination evident in her co-star.<br /><br />The supporting players all pull their weight as well, from Ginnifer Goodwin's Oscar worthy performance to Robert Patrick's sinister father, the man we loathe in entirety yet learn isn't without saving, as well as the entire cast of young actors and musicians all help create a feeling and a mood that perfectly compliments the films purpose.  Not a single performance is forced, out of place or unworthy of mention.<br /><br />Another highlight is the music, all of which was sung by the actual actors themselves, which is another step-up from last years `Ray'.  Both Joaquin and Reese devour each sung line with enthusiasm and pure talent and it also helps cement them into their characters, fleshing out both Johnny and June and making them more real.  These are in no way shape or form mere imitations.  Both Phoenix and Witherspoon created these characters brilliantly and beautifully.  From the accurate sets to the costumes and stage performances `Walk the Line' is a fantastic biopic complete with acting bravado and a script that truly brings these legends to life.legance and patience that the viewer becomes so invested in these characters as people and we begin to sympathize, rationalize and relate to their very souls.

You'll be happier.
B00005NB0H|5.0|In 1970,The Who released \\"Live At Leeds\\" as a six-song LP full of explosive,potent rock the night The Who played Leeds University Feb. 14 of the same year,namely the 15-minute \\"My Generation\\",\\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Magic Bus\\".In the mid-90's,[[ASIN:B000002OVJ Live at Leeds]] was expanded to 14 tracks,remixed/remastered in excellent sound and contained all the songs performed by The Who the night outside of \\"Tommy\\",barring the \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" medley.Finally,in 2002,the entire Leeds-including \\"Tommy\\" featured on Disc 2 exclusively-was made available at last on this 2-disc \\"Deluxe Edition\\".If one ever doubts that The Who invented punk,metal or garage-rock or their greatness,this will blown them away in a flash.When the reviewers say that this is \\"the best live album\\",they're not kidding!With a new remix supervised by Pete Townshend himself and remastered by famed engineer Jon Astley,it has never sounded so powerful,crisp and raw as it does here.The live \\"Tommy\\" segment is worth the price of this edition itself.(\\"A bargain,the best I ever had\\" indeed!)\\"Live At Leeds(Deluxe Edition)\\" is something no serious rock fan should be without period.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie was great and it was really enjoyable and funny. I have had this movie since it came out as I went to see it in the movie theater.  This would be my favorite movie of all time. Sulley(James P. Sullivan) and Mike Wazowski (the main characters of this movie) are my favorite characters in this movie and are my two favorite characters in any movie. Randall Boggs would be my third favorite character in the movie because he makes me LAUGH!! But he gets destroyed into a trailor during my favorite part of the movie which is when Mike and Sulley are hanging or flying on doors to try to get Boo home. Boo is my least favorite character in this movie because she CRIES a lot during the movie and just not my favorite. Celia, who Mike is in love with isn't all that great too. But I think Roz is great. She makes me laugh when she tells Mike that he didn't turn in his paperwork. and Mr. Waternoose would be my 5th and last most favorite character in this movie till he gets arrested by the CDA. Also, the part where Mike and Sulley go to Himalayas is great because they're in a BLIZZARD!! The worst part of the movie is when Sulley and Mike take Boo home that's when I feel to cry. But overall, this is a really great movie which I wish I could give this 10 stars. Please get this movie but Shrek s$cked!!!<br />Best film of the year.
B000002U9L|5.0|The first time I saw The Labyrinth I was 7 or 8, probably 1987/88 Rotterdan, on tv and it really blew me away. It has a fairytale quality, a beautiful world of make-believe, truly wonderful. Years later, 2006 I went to the local fantasy shop (which has unfortunately moved from Rotterdam to Delft), saw the special DVD box with special drawing cards inside and bought it then and there. In that very same year I also bought the soundtrack.    While the \\"Opening Title\\" transports you to The Labyrinth, \\"Into The Labyrinth\\" makes you want to walk inside and be lost forever.  \\"As the World falls down\\" and \\"Within You\\" are both beautiful and haunting, showing Jareth's desperation and (maybe) love for Sarah.  \\"The Gobling Battle\\" is a blast, \\"Home at last\\" makes one feels like it is a preparation for the BIG Party in \\"Underground\\".
B000OYC3J8|5.0|perhaps its just me but i think Icky Thump could be used to describe Meg Whites consistently simplified drumwork. The reason why i love Stripes is because of how expiremental and mix-mashed they are, but on this one in particulary because of how it sounds very much like the early acid-rock years. the song \\"st. Andrews\\" sounds like a beatles tune gone berserk. Rag and Bone has a nice bluesy undertone and through the lyrics, makes theft and pickpocketing very very comical.    by now, we know what to expect from a White Stripes album. if you didnt like them before, you wont like them now. if you liked them than, youll love this one.
B00006J3WH|3.0|I am very surprized that nearly 300 people reviewed this, and not one person seemed to notice that the songs on this CD are not exactly the same as what actually appeared in the Once More With Feeling episode.  Some of the songs are slightly edited, have different mixes, even different vocals and the major thing that disappointed me is that there was some important dialogue that was deleted that they should have kept as part of the songs.  For example, Dawn's line \\"The hardest thing in this world to do, is to live in it\\" nor is the part where Sweet (the Demon) realizes that Buffy is Dawn's sister and says something to effect \\"The Slayer, bring her to me, I want to see the Slayer Burn\\" was also omitted.    Get your Koombayayas out - 76 bloody trombones... (that wasn'y included either....    Play the DVD - the soundtrack is much better.
B0001KZM3O|3.0|I bought this when it came out and was very disappointed. Maybe he should have slept on it for a few years. The right people playing the wrong thing. There are better ways to put across this emotion and this was ill conceived.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I first heard Brad Paisley when he had the song \\"Whiskey Lullaby\\" out and I liked it. I had never purchased a Paisley cd and decided to purchase this one after hearing \\"Ticks.\\" I enjoy every song on the cd. There are no filler tracks. I personally like \\"All I Wanted Was A Car,\\" \\"Online\\" and \\"It Did,\\" and the duet with Carrie Underwood. I would recommend this album to anyone. Brad knows how to write songs that people can relate to and he has done it with 5th Gear.
0786915749|5.0|They never expected to become heroes, never desired the war that brought them together, only to shape their lives forevermore, destroying some, elevating others, but nevertheless, mercilessly changing all. It is autumn in the city of Solace. A time when old friends seek to reunite, a time for love and joy, tenderness and care, a time to celebrate the future and ignore the regrets of the past. Only, these typical pleasantries are remiss from the formerly cheerful town of Solace for war is in the air. There is talk of strong and dangerous armies amassing in the north, talk of monsters and ancient beasts arising from their centuries long sleep ready for destruction and vengeance. And, trapped within these turbulent times, are our confused heroes striving to the very last moment to save their beleaguered realm from the evil that is to come; the evil that will usher in the legendary War of the Lance. Strum, a noble Solamnic Knight; Tanis, a dejected half-elf; Tasslehoff, a happy go lucky kender; Flint, a grumpy old dwarf; Caramon, a strong and valiant warrior; Raistlin, a frail yet powerful mage with hidden depths that will one day erupt; Goldmoon, bearer of a healing staff, daughter of Chieftain; Riverwind, Goldmoon's  devoted paramour: this is our band of unlikely heroes. Together, these valiant warriors must struggle in a world gone awry, must fight not only the ensuing mayhem but their all too human frailties as well. This then is there story.<br /><br />Easily acclaimed as one of the greatest modern fantasy epics, Dragon's of Autumn Twilight is well worth the title. Few books there are that can rival it in style, eloquence, depth of characters, and good old fashioned story telling. This is the kind of tale to share with friends and family around the cozy glow of a camp fire, the kind of drama suitable to pass on to one's children and one's children's children. Indeed, the realm of Krynn itself seems to truly exist as if for no other reason than the reader's devoted belief. Whether you, the avid bibliophile, are drawn to fantasy literature or not, Dragon's of Autumn Twilight cannot but captivate and enthrall leading the reader on an adventure that not only spans the narrow gulf of reality, but that of time and space as well taking the reader on delightful adventures filled with lovable characters that soon initiate themselves as one of the family.<br /><br />Complimented with an imaginative setting filled with myriad fantasy creatures both expected and original, the tale starts as it means to go on allowing the action to take place almost immediately. The reader is never once bored or distracted rather the story works like one of Raistlin's elusive spells, enthralling and captivating the reader to the exclusion of all else. So addictive is the tale, so unique is the drama, and so effecting are the characters that the reader soon forgets all other aspects of life and fully enters into the realm of Krynn battling beside the valiant warriors, suffering when they suffer, rejoicing when they rejoice, and never once forgetting the stakes of the battle for all Krynn hangs in the balance. Will evil triumph or will good conquer?<br /><br />Provided with a likable cast, the reader soon finds it amazing that half elves, kender, and dwarves, are equally sympathetic as the human characters. Also, the \\"good\\" protagonists are never burdened with that sickeningly perfect aura usually subscribed to fantasy warriors. Rather, each character is fleshed out as it they were real allowing that with their strengths weakness also follow making a cast of un-human characters bear the burdens of human emotions. Likewise, the villains are also fulfilled with realistic personalities effectively imbuing them with a more chilling aura. Classic characterization at its finest.<br /><br />As with all truly good tales, the writing style employed also boasts of perfection. Each sentence is erudite yet easy to understand neither speaking down to the reader nor becoming burdened with unnecessary simplicity but instead choosing to fall in the middle where perfection lies.<br /><br />The conclusion was shocking, dramatic and intriguing instantly leading the addicted reader onto the second Dragonlance drama, Dragons of Winter Night where the Chronicles series continues to build in suspense and complexity leading the reader on a wondrous journey into the fantastic realm of Krynn where anything is possible.<br /><br />Final Thoughts: Dragons of Autumn Twilight is a novel not to be missed. Filled with fantastic wonders, epic battles, shattering sorrow and insurmountable joy, it contains everything that makes a novel truly perfect. And, when finished, the joy is further enhanced by even more epic dramas from the realm of Krynn.

B000P2A24W|5.0|I love this album, not this is not country, this is melodic, beautiful, well done album!  Very pleased with the results--I smell a Grammy finally:-)
B000P2A24W|1.0|Forget even categorizing him as rock, this is full-on country.  Even the name is cliché as all hell.  Way too many ballads.  The musicianship doesn't even constitute a good country album; besides, he's completely forgotten his roots in the quest to become ever-popular + relevant.  To the real fans that have known him since the S/T '83 album + before this is total sonic blasphemy.  Don't get me wrong, Young Guns really was a great album; but every time he returns to the cowboy motif he goes further + further in.  Whether it's their age showing or the influence of whatever girlfriend Richie has at the time, they've decided to bury any remaining sign of their pop-metal past.  A \\"Chris Gaines\\" album in reverse.  <br />  <br />For a REAL BJ album check out 7800 Fahrenheit or Slippery!
B000NVT0RU|5.0|I like war movies, i glanced at the box in the video store, quickly misinterpreted what it was about and rented it.<br /><br />From this fortunate mistake came an interesting and worthwhile experience. For i knew nothing about the colonial French army in WW2 and this is an excellently done movie, that not only informs but motivates and interests me in the topic as well.<br /><br />Usually movies with an deeply felt political or social point, loose the film making quality, sacrificing it for the bigger emotional point that the authors wish to get across. It is rare for a movie to have good historical knowledge-it's often twisted to fix predispositions, good film making technic-character development, coherent plot, and good filming, and a deep political point or as this movie does tackle currently hot button topics. \\"Z\\" and \\"The Battle of Algiers\\" and \\"Hell in a Very Small Place\\" are the only other movies quite like this one that i can remember, combining war with political and social commentary and not loosing sight of the need to present the film technically well.<br /><br />The big point is explained in the \\"making of days of glory\\", the usual dvd additional features, for once worth watching and much better than the usual shovelware. That is for those French citizens today of North African (or Sengalese) descent to relearn the sacrifices their grandfathers and great-grand fathers made in liberating France from the Nazis. As a second point, for those French citizens of European descent to be more aware and thankful for the few remaining ex-colonials soldiers in their midst before they die, and to acknowledge that those people in their lives from Africa have long ago paid in blood for their right to be there and to be genuine Frenchmen.<br /><br />The movie is about racism, judging a person by the color of their skin or the culture of their parents without making any attempt to hear their stories, to see what they have done, where they have come from or what they believe. The movie in a rather nice but complex way shows several ways that racism twists and distorts human relationships. It is also good to see the arena as something other than the US, for racism is not just an American problem but a human one.<br /><br />The scene with the tomatoes. Only white French troops are given them, the North Africans and Sengalese are not. But as the movie points out, bullets don't discriminate, they indiscriminately kill anyone wearing a French uniform. The scene with the ballet dancers, culture is deeply embedded in us all and we can only see it oftentimes when it grinds into another one and the differences are made obvious to us. When the main character mounts the box and tells the soldiers that both France and the colonials must change, there is a veiled reference to the post-WW2 colonial wars of independence that make the issues of the movie so complex and difficult to understand. When you see the violence with which the sargent responses to the knowledge that he is a son of a Berber women, you can (as all good movies do) feel both his shame and the surprise of the other man at his comment being so hated when it was offered in deep and understanding sympathy. And that is the great value of learning with movies, the visceral, the emotional impact of images and a story told with them. Now i can, and probably will, look into the issue with more reading, but this is an excellent place to learn something about a neglected and important time in recent history.<br /><br />Pieces of the movie are very attractively done, the uniforms-baggy North African turbans and robes with sandals, in the French winter (how can anyone live in this cold?, a point echoed in me). The fear, the brotherhood of warriors, the French white women plus the Berber soldier and the way society seems to conspire to destroy their relationship, the way some of them steal from the dead. The movie is full of unique and moving pieces that will make it a movie worth owning andwatching again, there is too much going on, too many new connections for the viewer to make to be satisfied with a single pass through it.<br /><br />I think that this movie is a genuine contribution to the ongoing dialogue between not just the European colonial powers and their African colonies, but between Islam and Christianity, racism and cultural conflicts. I need only remember that Augustine was called names because he was small and dark, for Monica was a Berber, to remember that Christianity is not European, not in origin nor in extent. I can hate and fear Islam as the greatest competitor of my faith, but that does not mean that every Muslim is my personal enemy, nor does it mean that i can't respect and honor them for their good deeds.<br /><br />it is a worthwhile experience, not only for the excitement and passion but for an analysis of the deeper and more important issues that it tries to teach and push us into. thanks to all involved in making this movie and making it available to me to watcha movie worth owning and watching again, there is too much going on, too many new connections for the viewer to make to be satisfied with a single pass through it.  <br />  <br />I think that this movie is a genuine contribution to the ongoing dialogue between not just the European colonial powers and their African colonies, but between Islam and Christianity, racism and cultural conflicts.

B000002GJH|3.0|The highlights of this album are probably the best Seattle-based stuff to come out in the whole Seattle-fixation era, and maybe that's because this was a release done out of heart-felt effort.<br /><br />The back story is quite well known by now--when Mother Love Bone spiritual center Andrew Wood died, bandmates joined with members of Soundgarden under the name Temple of the Dog for an indirect tribute--wanting to honor Andrew's spirit with music.  This clearly inspired the first two tracks (and probably among the best stuff on the album), \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" and \\"Reach Down\\" (which is one of the best 11-minute rock songs out there).  The album continues with a couple more strong tracks, \\"Hunger Strike\\" (still listenable even after all of the overplay in the Seattle-craze days and also includes Eddie Vedder) and \\"Pushin' Forward Back.\\"<br /><br />Had the so-called Seattle sound always had such depth of emotion and drive, it probably would have become more of a school of influence than a passing musical fad and fashion--the first four tracks alone are worth buying this disc for.  There is a unity of sound and spirit in these songs, the sense of a band that plays to each other rather than out to the crowd for attention and approval (and, let's face it, the money).  Also, the range of length among these four tracks show them to be songs that define themselves, that dictate their own needed sound rather than have a format cookie-cuttered onto them.  Tracks 1-4 will show you some of the highest potential Seattle grunge could have brought to the world.<br /><br />But, unfortunately, after that, the album sags aplenty.  I have little that keeps me going for the last 6 tracks except maybe \\"Your Savior,\\" but that one doesn't even always capture my interest.  Cornell's vocals feel a little more standardized, the song construction a little more hackneyed.  I'll freely admit that part of this was to connect to the fun element of Mother Love Bone, and after all it's all rock and not poetry, but still, there's a lot I find I just want to skip over for the last half or so of this album.<br /><br />But that's all a shame to say, because the first 25 minutes or so will really perk up your ears.  Andrew Wood is properly paid homage to here, but in the end the Seattle script wins out.there's a lot I find I just want to skip over for the last half or so of this album.

6305090564|4.0|If you want to explain the hellish abomination that was Van Helsing, you need look no further than Deep Rising, the original Sommers blend of horror and flip humour that was the template for The Mummy movies and what was to follow. Deep Rising is where Sommers got his schlocky blend of humour and horror just right-it's fast, funny and completely over the top. Treat Williams is great as the wisecracking hero who confronts a big beasty from the deep on a ocean liner. This probably needed the likes of Harrison Ford to sell it at the time, but Williams has such a twinkle in his eye that it doesn't matter, both he and this gulity pleasure are great fun to watch.
075640407X|5.0|Never wrote a review about a book before, so I'll keep this short.  This book is a Breath of fresh air.  I dreaded finishing the book and can't wait for the second (April 08').  I almost felt like I was there along with Bast and Chronicler, listening to a man who has a lot to tell.  This story took me to another place.  And for that Patrick,  I thank you.

B000P2A24W|5.0|A HUGE Bon Jovi fan, such as ME, a new fan or even a non fan will love this CD.  For the past few months I've been saying Lost Highway will be a huge success (of course all the press surrounding the release this week doesnt hurt either).....  There is something for everyone on Lost Highway, up tempo twangy rockers with a \\"raise your hands to the Hey Hey's\\" type songs, soft smooth ones to slow dance to, and a little bit o country sounding songs in between.    Not really loving the song \\"We Got It Going On\\", but every single other track is GREAT!  I've seen the band perform several of the new songs in the past two weeks and the material sounds amazing live - \\"I Love This Town\\" will be played like they are singing it about every city that they play in this summer and on the tour next year.  Roll down your car windows, let the summer breeze blow your through hair and crank the song \\"Lost Highway\\"!!!  Bon Jovi forever!
B000P12LWY|5.0|Although I knew I was going to enjoy this series, I didn't realize how intensely I would immerse myself into it.  I saw a movie about Sir Thomas Moore in the 1960's, but had no idea what Henry did to him (I won't give it away.  It's in the history books!) Jeremy Northram and Sam Neil both do excellent jobs playing their characters, and I love Henrys \\"Brat Pack\\"!  This series caused me to research Henry, Katherine, the illegitimate child (they played with history here) and Woolsey; I already knew about Mary and Elizabeth because one of my great, great, greats was Sir Walsingham so I was advised during my youth about about our British ancestory and about the Babbington Plot.  I didn't know that illegal children of Royals were all dubbed Fitzroy.  I know that Henry is given credit for Green Sleeves, but some historians believe he didn't actually write it, others believe he did.  The costumes are amazing.  Joan Bergin has really made her mark on this era of fashion, and on fashion today! I loved the \\"Degas\\" dresses she came up with for the play put on for theambassadors, and for Gabrielle Anwar to lend a hand and fashion the lovely crowns the women wore during this episode makes me feel that this cast must not only do their best on the set but they have great fun behind it.   But other than their costumes, their acting is superb, the sets are incredible, and I am on the edge of my seat at the end of each show, practically drooling for the next.  I don't see how I will make it until 2008, and I am already recording the 1 through 10 shows on my DVR; I will still probably buy the DVD when it is released.  I hope they don't stop with Ann, although she would leave very large steps to fill if they introduced the third wife.  Keep it up, don't ever go off the air.  And by the way, I was a Dexter fanatic and although I still am, this show has swept me up in history, imagination, ideas, crushes, admiration and all!

B000LC3ID8|1.0|What was great about the original Saw, was that there was a great twist ending and the gore was hinted at, not really graphic, leaving the viewer to conjure up the worst in their imagination. This was a similar tactic used in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, what was not seen seemed so much worse. With Saw 2, things took a little more graphic turn, there was still a nice twist ending, and the story wasn't as heavy handed, there was a \\"fun\\" element to the story. Saw 3 cranks up the gore, and slaps the viewer with a heavy, very melancholy storyline. Saw 3 is so depressive, there is really no one to cheer for, you really don't care who lives or dies as there is really no character development, and the two new main characters/victims are so unlikable you begin to lose interest. While I agree Saw 3 wraps up loose ends from Saw 2, it ends up presenting so many new questions that it doesn't feel like a complete film. Now you will have to see part 4 when it comes out to see how the storyline of part 3 wraps up. I don't care any longer, I am done playing Jigsaw's game. Unless your idea of entertainment is seeing broken bones being pushed through the skin, or toolbox brain surgery, stay away from this bloody mess of a film.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Wow, what a great sounding and FUN album!      Meat City almost knocked me off my sofa!  After hundreds of listenings, I'm hearing tons of new harmonies, keyboard accents, great bass notes and crisp and clean sound altogether.  Alright, this has always been a favorite John album of mine.  I bought it new and grew to love it.  This remastered version put the Plastic Ono Band IN my living room.      Out The Blue, sung with great gusto and feeling, is an unknown classic, give it a listen.  John's attitude is relaxed and seemingly content, especially in Freeda People (Bring on The Lucy).      I know (I know) has great vocals displaying Lennon's 50s infulence.      You Are Here featues great harmonies and keyboard by Ken Ascher...I thought it was Nicky Hopkins playing.     Back to Meat City....what a lost A-side, in my opinion.  Fun lyrics and a sizzling lead guitar.  I'll always love this record..uhhh CD.  God, I miss John Lennon...it really was the end of the innocence in life for me..
1591396190|5.0|I am not deducting one star for the gaps listed above, because on balance the book is one of a handful of business books that is serious as opposed to the pap that one generally sees.<br /><br />There are other in-depth reviews, so I will summarize only what mattered to me.  The bottom line here is create new markets and woo new customers, rather than compete.  With this in mind, I am stunned that they do not examine more carefully C.K. Prahalad's wisdom as communicated in [[ASIN:B00006L5AW The Fortune at the Bottom of the Pyramid]].  He teaches us that capitalism (never mind the immoral predatory part) focuses on the billion at the top who can afford new sub-zero refrigerators and disposable goods.  He teaches us that unlike this group, worth one trillion a year, the five billion at the bottom of the pyramid represent four trillion a year, but their refrigerator needs are different: for $2, an African \\"refrigerator\\" is two ceramic vases with broad bases and necks, one inside the other.  Buried in the ground, they keep meat fresh for five days.<br /><br />Their key principles:<br /><br />1)  Reconstruct/cross market boundaries<br /><br />2)  Focus on big picture not numbers<br /><br />3)  Reach beyond existing (and I would add, illiterate) demand<br /><br />4)  Get the strategic sequence right<br /><br />The heart of their book is \\"first to market\\" and \\"create new markets.\\"<br /><br />They address three customer groups for study:<br /><br />1)  Soon to be customers (e.g. young, international)<br /><br />2)  Refusing customers<br /><br />3)  Non-customers for whom new attractive value can be created<br /><br />I especially like the discussion, two thirds of the way through the book, on six blocks to buyers utility:<br /><br />1)  Customer Productivity<br /><br />2)  Simplicity<br /><br />3)  Convenience<br /><br />4)  Risk (reduction)<br /><br />5)  Fun and image<br /><br />6)  Environmental friendliness (a scant mention).<br /><br />This is a seriously useful book, a fast read, and worthy of note.

0743277708|5.0|This is one of my top five favorite books of all time.  It's incredibly well written.  If you like animals (in this case rabbits), action and captivating characters, you can't go wrong with this book.  It's a marvelous tale of family, friendship, loyalty, courage and survival.  Some of the descriptions are a bit lengthy for my taste, but otherwise it's spectacular.  Also of note, the movie adaptation holds pretty true to the book and is a good alternative for those who have difficulty reading, though there are a few scenes that may be too graphic for very young viewers.  However, I ultimately found the book much more satisfying, as it was wonderful creating my own mental images of these adventures.  Highly recommended!
B00008PX8P|5.0|I was, am, and always shall BE mesmerized by this DVD complilation. It's a journey through the 70s, and it brought back a lot of great childhood memories as I watched Robert Plant prance on stage and Jimmy Page play like he was on fire. Which he was. But what sets Zeppelin apart from today's musical bands is simple: They didn't write or perform social/political commetary in a time filled with anti-war sentiment and civil injustices. Zeppelin saved that for Neil Young, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, David Bowie- just to name a few. This was genius on Zeppelin's part and that's why Zeppelin will always be a classic rock band. Their songs are in no way dated the way other bands' songs from the 70s are. Oh sure, their clothes are dated on this DVD- check out Jimmy Page's hand-sewn astrology symbols on his pants- but their music will outlive any of us, all of us- and thank Zeppelin for that.
B00008O0WN|2.0|I'm a late bloomer trekie fan.  Within the past 4 four years I really got into the Star Trek world (I'm a die hard TNG,DS9, & VGY fan).  I also just buying most of the movies.  I looked forward to Nemesis mainly because of the Romulan angle.  To me, they are the most intresting group that never received their full due in any movie.  I felt that the plot was very weak and was ok for a one time viewing.  I know with all the great stories on the shows that someone could have written a better movie.  I hope the upcoming movie is alot better.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I was always a Brad Paisley fan since he came out, so I bought this CD as soon as it came out. What I like most about Paisley is, compared to most other artists, he actually puts over 11 songs on his albums and none of them are fillers. A lot of people were disappointed with the Underwood/Paisley duet \\"Oh Love\\", but I like it a lot. My favorites are \\"All I Wanted Was a Car\\", \\"Letter To Me\\" (almost like a song about me when I was 17), the very funny \\"I'm Still a Guy\\", and the 'toe-tapping' \\"Mr. Policeman\\". If you've liked his instrumental pieces in the past, you will not be disappointed with \\"Throttleneck\\", his best yet. I hope to see a music video for \\"Better Than This\\", with all the cameos of celebrities his buddy mentioned in the song.  Any Brad Paisley fans must buy this album. Anyone looking to try him out for the first time, I highly recommend this one. Very, very good.
0143038419|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  It is an amazing journey of a woman that could indeed be anyone of us.  Gilbert has a way of writing that seems as if she is in conversation with you.  When I grow up I want to write just like her!
0156027321|3.0|The story is mostly narrated by Pi himself, hence the title \\"Life of Pi\\".  Please note that this is a work of fiction, lest someone falls into a \\"Blair Witch\\" trap.  It should also be noted that Pi is an unreliable narrator, spiritually conflicted, a bit simple-minded, and not always likable.<br /><br />Life of Pi begins with Pi's childhood, his religious convictions, and his interesting observations on zoos and wildlife behavior.<br /><br />The story then startling launches into the meat of the book: a bizarre survival scenario in the Pacific Ocean--a common, but always frightening theater of isolation.  The book then ends briefly with some arguably heavy-handed philosophical diatribe.<br /><br />This book is an easy read.  The vocabulary, other than marine terminology, is not much past high school level and the sentences are short and direct.  Unfortunately, this also means that this book is not \\"meaty\\" enough to be savored by those who have read a high level of philosophy discourse.  By the end of the book, Martel's themes are handed to the reader on a silver platter.<br /><br />Still, Life of Pi is a good read.  Martel is an engaging writer with a rich imagination.  I surmise that he would be an excellent science fiction writer.  However, this book is really geared towards a high-schooler's first foray into philosophy or to an adult who may, unfortunately, not have much time or interest to delve into philosophical matters.<br /><br />Life of Pi probably won't change your beliefs about God or any convictions you have about the proper place of human reason, but it will make for an entertaining read on a quiet introspective night.
1592289444|1.0|As I read the book, I kept on going back to my belief for the last 30 years that most Americans do not understand just how evil the old Soviet Union was.  It was a remarkable story about to what lengths a person can go to resist evil, and communism is certainly the greatest evil in  world history except for Nazism.  Unfortunately, as much as I understand how horrible the USSR was, and to what lengths someone would go to escape the brutality, I had my doubts when reading the book. I was especially surprised that no one has ever heard from the American who was in the Gulag, Mr. Smith, and escaped with the author. It is not unbelievable that an American was imprisoned or that an American escaped. American born individuals who were in the USSR were terrorized by Stalin in the 1950s. However, it is difficult to imagine that there would not be any documented evidence, including anything from Mr. Smith or his survivors of his involvement in this tale.  Therefore, I regretfully conclude that we, the readers, have been had.  For readers who are interested in further exploring the evil of the Gulag, and the power of the human body and soul to survive, I would highly recommend Menachem Begin's \\"White Nights\\" and Natan Sharansky's \\"Fear No Evil\\".
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I titled my review \\"Icky thump- What the Heck?\\" because when I was searching Google for lyrics from one of the new White Stripes songs \\"effect and cause\\" off the Icky Thump CD I learned from Wikipedia that Icky Thump is \\"derived from \\"Ecky-Thump\\", a Lancashire, England colloquialism\\".  That is a smart way of saying it is slang. A little further investigation led me to learn it is loosely translated to mean \\"what the heck?\\". They changed the spelling so we Americans would pronounce it properly. There was also something about changing it so they wouldn't get sued. I haven't looked into that one.     But, wait! There's more. I actually bought the CD (on my lunch break on Tuesday this week, the day it was released in true geek form) and listened to it a few times.     So, of course, I love it. I can admit my review may be a bit biased, I LOVE the White Stripes. It sounds familiar and I like that. It wasn't an instant \\"This is the best album I ever heard\\" at first listen but the first time I heard \\"Get behind Me Satan\\" (and all the others) I felt the same way. Now, I listen to those CD's and I can't even fathom what second that I didn't like.   So, let me give you my first impressions and I later I will probably worship the entire thing (if it is anything like the last 5 albums).     If I didn't mention a track it is only because it didn't make an immediate impression on me. It means that I liked it but it did not stand out. I usually find after I listen to a CD for awhile it's these songs that end up being my favorite. Stay tuned.       * Track 1. \\"Icky Thump\\" - you have heard it. You know. It is good. Part of it reminds me of Seven Nation Army (with the stomping bass drums), but that is a good thing. I like Seven Nation Army.   * Track 3 \\"300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues\\" gets 5 stars from me just for the title.   * Track 4. \\"Conquest\\" - makes me laugh and I like to laugh. It is over the top with a mariachi sound.   * Track 7. \\"St. Andrew\\" Scares me. Bag pipes comeinto play and NOT in a Drop Kick Murphy's kind of way. With all the strangeness and the talking, I am not sure if it can even be classified as a \\"song\\". I have been listening to the CD on repeat at work as background noise and I have found after a few times through I am skipping this track. I honestly can't think of any other White Stripes songs that I have to skip. With that being said, it is still better than anything Justin Timberlake (and the likes) has ever put out. I would still rather listen to this song over and over forever instead of listening to \\"Sexy Back\\" even once. :)   * Track 8 \\"Little Crème Soda\\" One of my favorites. There's nothing left for me to tell you. Oh well, Oh well. (ok, go listen to the song and then re-read this)   * Track 9 \\"Rag and Bone\\" I like this song a lot. Maybe my favorite. It has some \\"spoken word\\" (if you call it that, you know, he and Meg are talking). The part about \\"Rich house, Dog House, Cat House, Halfway homes\\" reminds me of that movie \\"The Fugitive\\" when Tommy Lee Jones is directing his men in the woods to find Harrison Ford   * Track 11 \\"A Martyr for My Love for You\\" Is a sweet sounding song (if you liked \\"We're Going to Be Friends\\" then you will like this one) about a guy you breaks up with a girl he really likes because he knows he will hurt her in the end. \\"Maybe these ruby shoes are a little cumbersome for you, maybe for you, now\\".   * Track 13 \\"Effect & Cause\\" is probably my favorite song (have I said this before?) Because I like the lyrics and melody. I read someone's review where they said they thought the melody kind of sounds like the Dukes of Hazzard theme song. That sort of annoys  me now when I am trying to enjoy the song (because it is not totally off base).     In conclusion, if you like the White Stripes you will like this album. It is different enough and unique enough (bagpipes and mariachi) without straying too far from the White Stripes sound. I remember reading an article once where Jack White said in his music he was \\"tricking\\" young rock kids to like the blues. I think he may be trying to trick us into liking bagpipes and mariachi, or maybe just to open our minds to appreciate other types of music.     Really this is a great CD with just a bit of weirdness thrown in and that is what the White Stripes have always been about.     If you are already a fan you will probably like it.  If you have never heard any of the other White Stripes CD, I recommend that you fall in love with those first and work your way up to Icky Thump      Go buy the album and tell me what you think.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|HORRIBLE sound. I came here to see if it was just me or my equipment. This sounds worse than some bootlegs I've heard! All the Worlds a Stage was recorded in 70what??  This is now the 21st century and that 70's live album sounds FAR superior.  What a waste of $25.  Good setlist.. if you could hear it over the crowd.. and terrible mixing!
1591841666|2.0|I agree with a number of the reviewers who gave this book less than three stars.  \\"The Dip\\" has an intriguing premise that makes one want to dive in and find out more.  But after reading it through I came away with still not being able to confidently identify the dip vs. the cul de sac.  If people look back on their lives at the times they quit a job, relationship, or hobby they will find that in most of those instances they were in a dead end.  People tend to have good instincts and gut feelings.  We can't expect to know  with hundred percent certainty what is the right move.  We make our move and deal with it.      I am sorry to call a short book incomplete because I dislike books of this nature that try to fill out some magical 200 pages with double spaced 12 point font. This book could be a jumping off point on the premise of quitting.  I look forward to more reviews and insights.
B000Q6GUTI|5.0|This one won't take long to go to DVD, but it's a muscular, enjoyabvle vehicle for up and coming star Michael Pena, with a strong supporting part from Mark Wahlberg.  Wonder why they put Wahlberg's name so big above the title, and his photo goes on the poster, when director Antoine Fuqua systematically throws the whole movie to Michael Pena, who plays a rookie FBI agent, Nick Memphis, who cracks the whole case open and gets to be responsible for clearing Wahlberg's name.<br /><br />Maybe Wahlberg was busyt making another movie so his screen time wss limited for this one?  But every time you think, OK, now Bobby Lee is really in trouble, wonder how he's going to get out of this one, Fuqua switches the action to miles away, to wherever Nick Memphis just happens to be.  If I didn't know better I'd think that the movie was planned to be just the first in a whole line of \\"Nick Memphis\\" action thrillers, in which Michael Pena would become a superstar on the line of Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hispanic.  The script had a lot of implausibilities, but surely the name \\"Nick Memphis\\" itself is the worst offender?  OK, maybe he was from Memphis, but that's like me calling myself Kevin San Francisco.  It just doesn't fly as a legal name, especially for a straightedge FBI guy.<br /><br />Saw this one on a plane and twenty minutes into I remembered I had read the book this was based on, Stephen Hunter's \\"Point of Impact.\\"  That book was pretty good.  Here I kept thinking, if I was Marky Mark, there was no way I would have fallen for Isaac Johnson's line of malarkey about, we want you to think of a good way to assassinate the US president, come on, anybody would have said, Hell no.  Yet in the book you believed it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Although I have to admit I've had trouble accepting the title of the new White Stripes album, I loved the song from the very first time I heard it after it became available on iTunes last spring. And when the album came out I couldn't wait to savor the rest of it. \\"Conquest\\" was the song that became my instant favorite. Later I became more enthralled with \\"Rag And Bone\\", then \\"Effect And Cause\\", then \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" and then \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\". The songs that I had the most difficulty getting into over the summer were \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\", \\"300 M.P.H. Torrential Outpour Blues\\", \\"Bone Broke\\" and \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\". Jack's evocative lyrics won me over to \\"You Don't Know...\\" (and \\"A Martyr For My Love For You\\" as well) and it's safe to say at this moment that the 3 songs I'm playing the most off of ICKY THUMP are \\"...Torrential Outpour Blues\\", \\"Prickly Thorn\\" and \\"Bone Broke\\". If I'm able to live with any White Stripes tune for awhile, it will begin to get stuck in my head (if not the chorus, then at least the guitar riff) and soon I'm wanting to hear again and again a song that I wasn't that crazy about to begin with. I guess herein lies the beauty of the music of The White Stripes. So many other artists can come up with catchy melodies and memorable lyrics that you like immediately but as time goes on you want to hear them less and less. With most of the songs on ICKY THUMP, as it was on GET BEHIND ME, SATAN, you have to give yourself time to absorb the beauty and passion of it's lyric, and familiarize yourself with the different time signatures of each section of the song. Once you do, it seems that you never want to let the songs go.   And speaking of lyrics, as usual, the songs abound in wordplay that is clever and memorable without ever sounding trite or pretentious: \\"You can't be a pimp and a prostitute too\\", \\"If you're headed to the grave, you don't blame the hearse\\", \\"It kind of struck a little bell, in fact; I like to keep my little shell intact\\", \\"In some respects I suspect you've got a respectable side\\", \\"If you're testing God and lying to His face, you're gonna catch hell\\".   After listening to ICKY THUMP for 5 months off and on, I can say with confidence that I love every single track on the disc and while I never could see how they could improve over such incredible masterworks as ELEPHANT and GET BEHIND ME SATAN, this is, in my opinion the absolute most solid, most satisfying, and best album they've made to date.   As far as the reviews here by Stripes fans who don't like ICKY THUMP, all I can say is that I'm baffled. Maybe you've been beaten down with Daughtry and Nickelback too much to appreciate music that is on such a grand scale. I could see some Stripes fans being put off by GET BEHIND ME SATAN, with it's piano and marimba and the somber tone of songs like \\"The Nurse\\" and \\"White Moon\\", but I would think the high energy set of tracks on ICKY THUMP would cause them to rejoice. How can you listen to the chorus of \\"Effect And Cause\\", the opening riff of \\"Rag And Bone\\" or the scorching guitar solos on \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" and come away saying you don't like this album?? How can you listen to \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn\\" and not hear \\"singing li de li de li oh oh\\" in your head for the rest of the day?  I remember how it took a little time for me to get used to the structure of some of the songs on GET BEHIND ME SATAN. But today, when I hear \\"The Nurse\\" or \\"Red Rain\\" or \\"White Moon\\" I'm transported back a few years to when those songs first started to become familiar to me and I already have some great memories associated with them -- memories of where I was and who I was with while those songs played during those first few months after that album came out.   On Thanksgiving day, 2 days ago, I was driving near my home and watching the snow come down and marveling at how it had been 84 degrees forty-eight hours earlier! I was listening to \\"Prickly Thorn...\\" and that song is bound to remind me of that pleasant morning every time I hear it for the rest of my life.   If you've been a fan of The White Stripes in the past and have been put off by ICKY THUMP, I ask that you get it out and give it another spin. You might find out that you judged it unfairly the first time around. And if you're opinion doesn't change, then I guess it's back to Bon Jovi for you.
B00002SSKI|5.0|The setting of this film is in Indiana in the early 70's. I was the same age as the characters at that time and was also growing up in a small Indiana town. The movie is like my youth on film..... I love it!!
6305128952|3.0|2/3 of this movie is great -- the plot with the girl and the horse is paced beautifully and the scenes are true and full of seriousness.  The romance plot with Kristen Scott-thomas is just embarrassing -- the worst moment (in a film directed by Robert Redford) is Robert Redford backlit on his porch like Lana Turner -- but there are other excruciating details (a cat's cradle symbolizing, let's see, the entangled complexity of their relationship perhaps?),  Kristen with the wind blowing through her hair on her horse,  the totally understanding husband, the Dvorak records of the lost love -- one could go on and on.
B000M3452Y|4.0|If I have one criticism of this album it would be that he wears his influences on his sleeve.  However, if you love Talking Heads' \\"Remain In Light\\" and Kraftwerk's \\"The Man Machine\\", you will probably like this album.  The last track is also reminiscent of Grandaddy.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Within Temptation is one of the best bands that I have heard in years. With Sharon den Adel's hypnotic voice, you are pulled into the song. The enchanting symphony ignites the hauntingly beautiful vocals.     \\"Memories,\\" plays across the soul and burns you with the desire to remember and embrace life.    Simply amazing.

1400079179|4.0|I just finished the book and it was absolutely spellbinding...until the end. I felt let down because the writing seemed to fade out when the climax was about to happen. There should have been more passionate scenes in the end. As a writer myself, I fully understand how this can happen. Novel writing is not easy, by any stretch of the imagination. I know how it feels when you get to the end of a manuscript and all you want to do is write the final lines and the words \\"The End\\"!!! All in all, it was a great book and again, Dan Brown knows how to tell a story! Worth reading, whether you're a Christian or not.<br /><br />Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet
B00005JO5L|4.0|This review is about the actual features contained on the Deluxe Edition that is due for release in September 2007. This marks the long overdue release of this controversial film on DVD, and it is good to see that there shall be plenty of extra features, since I have been arguing with other people about the meaning of this film's ending since its release in 1980. Cruising stars Al Pacino as a cop who infiltrates the homosexual S&M night life scene in order to solve a murder. Unable to just leave his work at the office in this case, the experience begins to affect his whole life - his outlook, his relationship with his girlfriend, everything. This is one of those love-it-or-hate-it movies. Few people come out on the fence on this one. It is a shocking dark film any way you approach it, but it is also just about the first major motion picture to portray homosexual men as strong masculine types, not just as the effeminite stereotypes that had been characteristic of the role since the birth of motion pictures. The soundtrack for this film has been remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 and includes the following extra features:<br /><br />Commentary by Director William Friedkin<br /><br />2 New Featurettes: \\"The History of Cruising\\" and \\"Exorcising Cruising\\"<br /><br />Original Theatrical trailer<br /><br />Languages: English & Spanish<br /><br />Subtitles: English, French, and Spanish (feature film only)<br /><br />Director William Friedkin has personally supervised the creation of an all new high-definition master and new 5.1 Dolby Digital audio track for the release with the new director's commentary. Eminent documentarian Laurent Bouzerou is the creator of the included  featurettes which contain interviews with actors and filmmakers who provide thorough perspective on the incidents surrounding the production. In addition to Friedkin and producer Jerry Weintraub, participants include editor Bud Smith, actors Don Scardino (Ted Bailey) and James Remar (Gregory), and real-life cops Randy Jurgensen (Det. Lefransky) and Sonny Grosso (Det. Blasio).

0743289412|5.0|Once again, master storyteller, Stephen King, has smucking blown me away. It took me less than a week to read this 512-page riveting, spellbinding novel, and those adjectives don't come close to how it made me feel while I was reading it, but they'll have to do for the moment. I love the way he literally crawls inside the brains and hearts of his characters and then displays it for the reader on the written page. I was caught up in the unfolding drama the same way I was when I was years younger and I read \\"It\\"...I just couldn't put the book down. Up until the very end, however, I was having a difficult time understanding why this book was categorized as a romance novel. I can grasp it now; now that I've read the entire book. Lisey's Story is not your typical \\"romance\\", though. How could it be? Stephen King wrote it. I don't think he is capable of mass-producing what society refers to as trashy romance novels. He is so far above that, or beyond that, or whatever you want to call it. He's been my idol for a long time and if the truth were known, he is probably the impetus behind my own style of writing. Not that I try to copy him or emulate him in my books, or even that I could, but he is the one who got me interested in reading and then eventually writing my own novels. Great big kudos, Stephen King! SOWISA!!!!! P.S. If you want to know what smucking means, you'll have to read the book!<br />Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet

0316010669|4.0|The strangest thing about Blink! Is the contradiction between the contents and the cover. Did any of the people quoted on the back cover actually read the book? (Hint: Blurb writers rarely read the books they comment on.) The quotes rave about the power of snap decisions, but Gladwell is much more ambivalent. He's particularly concerned with how racial stereotypes misinform judgments, so much so that Gladwell finds he has an intuitively negative opinion of African Americans -- despite being a black man. I suspect he spent some time thinking about when he was going to introduce his Jamaican mother; the book itself is an experiment in the power of framing and bias.<br /><br />Contrary to the back cover, and the subtitle of \\"the power of thinking without thinking\\", this is a book about both the power and the treachery of the unspeaking mind. On the one hand we have powerful non-verbal detection of deception and emotional context, on the other hand we have unconscious bias based on height and ethnicity, the election of George ... err .. Warren Harding and the shooting of Amadou Diallo.<br /><br />I'd been expecting a superficial justification of impulsive thinking, so I was pleasantly surprised to find Gladwell's Blink! is a much deeper work. On the other hand, the book is also somewhat muddled. Once Gladwell moved away from domains in which natural selection has build powerful non-verbal tools, such as deception, mating and eating, his examples of good impulsive analysis became much less persuasive. The \\"red team\\" commander's success seemed to owe much more to correct and measured analysis than impulsive decisions (I'd read the story before by the way. The US military needs to retire a lot of generals.). The Cook County MI algorithm story is about the superiority of an analytic decision tree over both analytic human reasoning and non-verbal impressions. I couldn't tell what the Diallo story was trying to communicate, I think he was saying that under high stress situations human reasoning collapses (the autism connection is highly speculative and has no biological foundation). That's certainly true, but hardly novel.<br /><br />In other cases I had a \\"Blink\\" type suspicion that we was cherry-picking and shading anecdotes. I'm particularly suspicious that there was more to the Cook County story than we were told -- it would be very odd for a test to be so sensitive and specific that prior probability of disease was irrelevant. In an afterword he introduces new research findings that contradict the simplistic models in the early book; that's commendable but it doesn't make the book more cohesive.<br /><br />I think Gladwell lost out by omitting an evolutionary context to human thinking -- a choice that may reveal his biases. An evolutionary approach to cognition explains why the \\"silent mind\\" can do so well with decisions lizards, birds and primates evolved around, such as mating, eating, fighting and deceiving. It also explains why the non-verbal mind can make terrible mistakes when evaluating CEOs, presidents, or cell phones. He could have connected the evolution of mind with his thesis experts do best when they combine the silent mind with formal symbolic analysis (words).<br /><br />I did learn one or two new things. I was impressed by the research on how easy it is to alter emotional state through priming methods.  Maybe those days when everyone around me seems to be driving badly are the results of some particularly noxious talk radio show.<br /><br />Ultimately Gladwell comes across, to me, as suspicious of the intuitive mind. I think he decides that non-experts should \\"trust\\" their intuition in domains where natural selection operates, but that even there they need to identify and adjust for bias based on appearance, gender, ethnicity, race, etc. Domain experts do best when they combine non-verbal intuition with analytic reasoning; they can use the intuitive input as a guide to developing a rational and defensible decision (something non-experts are said to have great difficulty with).<br /><br />That sounds like a plausible path. When making expert decisions in the non-primeval world, write down that initial \\"Blink!\\" impression -- but don't trust it. Adjust for bias and use it as the basis for a time limited and bounded analysis by translating it into a defensible rationalization. Then attack the rationalization. If it survives, then credit the silent mind. If it dies, recognize the failure of the paleolithic mind in a technocentric century.ficulty with).    That sounds like a plausible path.

B000ASDFJU|1.0|sleazy entertainment for fans of \\"friends.\\"  this is one of the worst popular TV shows ever.  i hate teh type of people this show portrays.  the fantasy is repulsive.  if a woman tells me shes a fan of the show i instantly think she's a skank.  This show has inspired a generation of tacky skanks (the ones too lazy and illiterate to read romance novels).<br /><br />SPOILER:  Unfortunately, all the characters don't die of Aids at the end.  So it sends a very unrealistic picture of modern urban promiscuity.  Shame on them.
0440238609|1.0|The stories are smothered by the weight of paranoiac, iconoclastic, pompous rubbish: The British government and the Church of England are part of an evil cabal with international and inter-dimensional scope, which is dedicated to maintaining its power while repressing adolescent sexuality.  The God of Christianity is senile.  Jesus, a maniacal malevolent demon, plans to take over, but is thwarted by a mother-witch sociopath who arouses him, wrestles him to the ground, and roll with him over a cliff.  Peaceful communities will always be destroyed by destructive entropy and spiteful beings, spiritual and otherwise.  The true God who created the universe is reduced to the random movement of \\"divine particles.\\" Such ideologies wrench the plot, strangling the narratives.  The implausibility of character and action increases with each book in the series, yielding not the probable impossible of good fantasy, but the improbable impossible of bad fantasy fiction.  Recommended for fans of dark fantasy who enjoy episodic stories with plot complication too trite for cowboy movies of the 1940s.
1593979827|4.0|I've been meaning to read Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for some time now. I finally got around to reading it (or in this case listening to it) and, in general, I liked it. However, I also have a few complaints.     First the good stuff. I enjoyed Pirsig's overall presentation and narrative style. His writing is animated and hyperdescriptive. This fact really brings the characters and their situations to life for the reader. I think this book is as timely as ever now, especially with the further explosion of technology since its original publication. As an engineer, his complaints about engineering and science without feeling and craftsmanship is spot on. His warnings about an ever present consumer, throwaway culture were prescient indeed.     The idea of using the motorcycle journey through the American west as a metaphor for his own journey through the landscape of philosphical thought was well chosen. It definitely has a modern Thoreau quality to it. Although there is plenty of purely abstract philosophical discussion in here, some of the thoughts presented are not just esoteric topics but also practical and timeless questions every man should ask himself at some point in his life. Who am I? What do I believe in? What is my role as a father, a teacher, and a student in the face of life's messiness and uncertainties? Should I tell my kid the harsh truth or should I give him a sugar-coated, Walt Disney version of life? Should one just unquestioningly accept the status quo and reap life's material rewards by \\"playing the game\\" or should one take the painful high road and rock the boat by seeking the truth for its own value? Pirsig clearly prefers the latter and so he bucks the authority of the hoity-toity academic establishment. For this his alter-ego character Phaedrus becomes the book's protagonist. However, as with everything, it comes at a cost. A big cost. I can personally relate to many of these ideas.    I like that Pirsig offers no easyanswers to any of these questions either. He contemplates, contemplates some more, comes to a conclusion, doubles back, takes a mental turn, stops, contemplates some more all the while pondering each question with as much clarity as humanly possible.     My biggest complaint with the book was that it was a bit longwinded in places. Much of the abstract philosphical discussions on quality were excessive and unnecessary and could've been condensed a bit. It seemed like alot pointless mental tallywacking to me. Ironically, Pirsig seems to come to the very same conclusion by the end of it all. Perhaps it was just part of a whole cathartic journey for him that needed to be worked through, I don't know.    All in all I liked this book though and I would recommend it to anyone with a patient, thoughtful side. Results-oriented types might find it irritating though. As I said, it offers no easy answers but instead raises many questions. It also makes some interesting observations on modern life and the culture we live in. Recommended.
B000ML18KS|5.0|The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. \\"Sin City\\" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes \\"Sin City,\\" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike \\"Sky Captain,\\" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three \\"Sin City\\" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is not quite a \\"Kill Bill\\" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. \\"Sin City\\" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler.

B000O178BY|5.0|Bought year zero when i read about it's political overtones online. The music itself is intricate. Designed to impress upon the listener truths about our time which many cannot see. The seriousness of the terror of our situation is shown 'full-frontal' through the language and the ideology behind the music.     While I enjoyed some tracks more then others, I definately approve of Reznor's \\"I'm gonna write what I want regardless of what you think\\" attitude. In my opinion, this is the basis of art.     Highly Reccomended Listening.
B000P2A256|5.0|To be honest, I didn't expect all that much from this album, since I wasn't all too keen on the first single.  However, since I loved \\"Songs About Jane\\", I figured I've give this album a shot.  All I can say, is that I'm glad I did.<br /><br />This album is part disco, part rock, part pop, and part new age.  It's a unique blend of genres that surprisingly works exceptionally well.  From beginning to end, this album takes you on an amazingly artistic, passionate journey.  I simply can't get enough of it.<br /><br />Standout songs are \\"Wake Up Call\\", \\"A Little of Your Time\\", \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\", and \\"Makes Me Wonder\\".
B000N6TX1I|5.0|Children of Men is a superb example of what can happen if a pathocracy is allowed to grow. What we see is the reversion to a system where 'useless eaters' are discarded en masse, with clear examples of 'internment camps' and 'detention centers' and how the people who get sent there are treated. Make no mistake, this is a prime example of the kind of atrocities committed at Gitmo and Abu Gharib, and those are but two examples of an extensive 'secret' prison system that exists all over the world!     The film was visually intense, with graphic revelations of reality the characters live in. Mass Graves, extermination 'check points', and sweet countryside are all in there, captured with beautiful cinematography.     Emotionally the film shocks you multiple times. I found myself crying at multiple points throughout the film. Not a film for children or those that want everything to be resolved by the end of the movie. It provokes thought and retrospection which is definitely a good thing.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Saw this show twice in Atlanta.  This is a must have.  The only thing about this show that isn't as good as the 87 tour is the girl singers.  They still are good though.  This was the stage and light show that will probally keep David Gilmore from ever touring Pink Floyd again.  I don't think they could out do it.  Great sound and lots of extras the lazer disc didn't have.  You won't miss Roger too bad trust me.  This show was history.  If you missed it this will get you there.  Turn it up and enjoy
B000LC55F2|4.0|The \\"magic tricks\\" themselves featured in \\"The Prestige\\" may not impress you much - some of you can detect them before the ending, I think - but don't worry, because the real magic of \\"The Prestige\\" is the seamless storytelling of Christopher Nolan, who tells the engaging story of two rival magicians of the turn-of-the-century London, Borden and Angier, using Nolan's trademark, non-linear timeline. Supported by the wonderful cast from England and America, \\"The Prestige\\" is a dazzlingly entertaining film full of twists and turns.    Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are perfectly cast as Borden and Angier, formerly friends and assistants to a lesser-talented magician. But they become long-time rivals after a disastrous accident on the stage, and both illusionists are willing to sacrifice everything, one for craft, the other for showmanship.    This is how I would describe the world of \\"The Prestige,\\" but the simple truth is the film itself is magic, or illusion, of very entertaining kind, which makes us keep guessing \\"What next?\\" with a blend of real history and total fantasy. See the character of Nicola Tesla, real-life revolutionary inventor, played by delightfully eccentric David Bowie, and you know what I mean. On the opposite side of him lives a contraption inventor Cutter, played by Michael Caine, whose humanity makes a great contrast to two star magicians.     Unfortunately the film is not perfect. Like \\"Batman Begins,\\" Christopher Nolan still does not know how to create credible female characters in spite of the impressive cast. Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo appear as supports, but their roles are relegated to the second fiddle.       \\"The Prestige\\" is not exactly about the magic itself; some part of it involves sci-fi elements that even David Copperfield cannot or wouldn't use. The film is more about the rivalry between two magicians, which result in passion and obsession hidden under the spectacular stage tricks. As such \\"The Prestige\\" issuccessful.
B000F48CD8|5.0|Indie Rock's answer to a \\"Supergroup\\". Every track on the disc should be on the radio. The most underrated and unrecognized band of the year. The band has great chemistry and passion for what they do. Incredible Live act. If you love good music, buy this NOW!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Planet Earth (PE) is by far the best produced documentary. The fact that its on HD is a big bonus. We have a HD-DVD player and PE is what we use to show off our home theater. That being said, PE renewed my interest in nature documentaries and respect for our planet. Earth has been and is being plundered daily. Thanks to PE, I respect nature even more and on a side note - plan to renew my subscription to Natural Geographic. The DVD itself is well produced and some of the shots from the sky looking down on a herd is simply breathtaking. All I can say is wow. If you plan to upgrade to HD DVD, PE is a great 1st addition. My personal preference is the BBC version to maintain originality. FYI, the regular DVD set has all the extra bonus material but I never really care much for them. This documentary was meant to be enjoyed on HD.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This is a beautiful film about how the Queen and the Prime Minister are able to work out a compromise on how to respond publicly to Princess Diana's death. It is startling to see how certain members of the royal family are completely out of touch with the modern world. Tony Blair walks the line between his sympathy toward those who see Diana as a people's princess, and his sympathy for the Queen, who carries herself with dignity no matter the situation.    Helen Mirren is awesome as the Queen, and the guy who plays Tony Blair does a great job, too. Thumbs way up!
B000OZ2CZW|3.0|Rihanna's third CD is a change-up that the title would have made it to be, Good Girl Gone Bad.  Looking to show the transition from a young girl in love to a woman experiencing the hard knocks of love and life, the music in this album also looks to make that transition.  I was definitely on the lookout for this album with the first two she put out, how beautiful she is of course (had to throw that out) and the smash single Umbrella which I was up on before radio played it look hundreds of times a day it seems like now.  After getting the CD, I felt like something was missing and that it fell short of what it could have lived up to although the tracks on it were pretty good.    Like I said, there were some darn good tracks as she displays a woman scorned through the pain of love.  Of course, Umbrella is up there.  Taking a risk like she did in doing something different help tracks like Breakin' Dishes which kind of sounds like it's got some techno mixed into it, Shut Up and Drive which sounds like she's referencing getting down with the one she's involved with to just rolling in a whip and just feeling it and Rehab.  She does put out an excellent duet with Ne-Yo in a Def Jam tag team track called Hate That I Love You.  A couple of tracks that to look for are Question Existing, Good Girl Gone Bad and Lemme Get That.  I liked how they mixed in rock aspects, techno and more R&B production.  But I really had the feeling of something missing.  Where was the Carribean feel or just a couple of beats that was prevelent on her first couple of albums?  I really thought they changed her way too much in leaving that off the album.  That is part of her roots and to make her cut that off from her music was a true negative in my view.  And I guess we can correlate the change of her look to the music as she's got the shorter, darker hair and black nails.  She still looks good in all, but not quite as much as before.  I just hope that is a phase just like this music was just to try something different for the moment.    I never try to knock someone for going another route.  That is not what I'm doing here.  I commend Rihanna for doing something other than what she tried before.  It's just that one would have thought she would have tied in the island feel a little more than she did.  Jay-Z is still my man 50 grand in all, but the crowds are looking a little more right is he might be trying to change her into being more like Beyonce too much.  He needs to let her stand on her own and be who she is which is that beautiful island lady that has a personality and talent of her own.  I appreciated the last album more cause she stood out on the plank with a more R&B display while keeping a heavy mix of island tunes and music that seemed like her.  It had a good balance to me while this one seemed a bit out of whack.  In the end, there are good tracks to listen to and album you can purchase.  But be expecting to be looking for a bit more on it. 3 1/2 stars!

B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This review is a little late since Lil' Miss Sunshine has brought out her third album but thought I'd get it in anyway.  Coming off the major impact she had with her debut album Music of the Sun, Rihanna came back at us quickly within an eight month period with her sophomore CD called A Girl Like Me.  On this album, it sticks with what made her such a sensation stateside with the dance grooves and party songs.  But you can see the transition into more emotional songs and ballads to try and show her vulnerable side.  Even though a couple of songs I could have done without, there were moments where she really came through.    With S.O.S. which samples from the 80s song Tainted Love, she had a great opening and hit song to draw to her album.  But that only tipped the iceberg.  Unfaithful took sometime to grow on me, but you can see that she was making that effort to show off her vocals and that life isn't always a party.  A couple of songs that helped to do that even more was Selfish Girl and A Million Miles Away, a song based on a relationship that is on the verge of breakup and can feel each other drifting apart even when they are near one another.  That was a splendid song in my opinion.  She still also keeps with the Carribean flavor and upbeat feel with her beats and production in songs like Break It Off featuring one of the lead men of dancehall in Sean Paul and We Ride.  The song that really did it for me on this CD and made me fall for her even more was P.S.(I'm Still Not Over You).  I mean, Wow!  It talks of maybe her writing a love letter to an ex and recalling moments in their relationship that she still hangs onto and how she has never really let go and may never will.  It may be a true essence of what happens when we let someone that we truly care for and love so much get away, whether more than likely the one that left is the one that will be hurting the most in the long run.  Truly amazing song in the way she wrote it, how the beat catches you and how the whole track just flows!    This album in my opinion is much better than her debut CD, which was a instant smash to say the least.  As I said, she sticks with what got her here in the upbeat, happy-go-lucky feeling tracks but starts to take a chance in standing out on a limb with some deeper under the surface songs that come from the heart.  It's a mixture that start to display what type of talent we may have on our hands.  If only they would have stuck to that on her following album a little more... but for this go round, it really worked out brilliantly!
B00000JPYQ|5.0|Categorically, the greatest live rock album. A substitute for Viagra. I am addicted to listening to it.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Like the Beatles seminal [[ASIN:B000002UAR Revolver [UK]]], Icky Thump is a  diverse album that shows that the band is moving in a new direction.  The leadoff song Icky Thump is the bands typical leadoff blast of rock.  The difference being that the song shows a newfound social awareness on the part of Jack and Meg.  From there, you never know which way the album is going to go.  From the Latin sounds of Conquest, which sounds like it belongs in a Quentin Tarantino movie, to two songs that feature bagpipes (back to back no less), Icky Thump is diverse and eclectic but maintains a consistent flow and never feels like a hodge podge of sounds thrown together.  I think it's fair to say that Icky Thump might not be the White Stripes best album, but it's certainly a blast to listen to. Recommended.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|The first time I plopped this CD in, I was thinking \\"if it's half as good as `Trouble' then I'd be happy.\\"  My happiness turned into complete elation.  This CD is just as good as `Trouble' and it continues to grow on me with every listen.  It is a little mellower than his first effort, perhaps a little darker.  Having said that, it doesn't take anything away from this beautifully crafted CD.    Highly, highly recommended.
B0002IQNAG|4.0|I wasn't going to write about this movie, because I'm not sure that I really have anything to say about it that hasn't been said by 40 million other people. But as I was creating this site I noticed that nearly every horror review I wrote mentioned it in some way, and I thought I should make some comment on it. I also realized that I would then have to update the links on all those horror reviews. Drat!<br /><br />The movie opens with chaos at a television station. A talk show is being interrupted as the cameramen and studio people shout at the man being interviewed. This scene, while cleverly delivering crucial exposition, also effectively conveys the panic and disorder overtaking society. There is just something that says \\"society is falling apart\\" about a television show, normally so scripted and controlled, devolving into chaos, and behind-the-camera people, whose entire profession depends on being quiet and staying off camera, shouting and disrupting a broadcast.<br /><br />Even this scene abounds in small details that seem disturbingly true-to-life and while also helping to fill in the backdrop of the world this film is positing. The station manager is broadcasting the locations of rescue stations that he knows have closed, likely sending people to their deaths, because he wants to be seen as purveying hope. One of the cameramen says to Francine [Gaylen Ross] that she should go ahead and leave. He just stands there calmly, and one wonders: why has he given up on himself so easily?<br /><br />The movie then switches to a housing project overrun with zombies. It begins to focus on a prejudiced cop who is beginning to lose his grip in the face of the rising zombie threat. This sequence is poignant in showing a man who is trying use his own prejudices about another racial group as a way of holding on to reality! Strange, unsettling, but also uncomfortably true-to-life.<br /><br />You'll just have to get used to the fact that this is all happening accompanied by significant gore.<br /><br />The four main characters soon assemble in their helicopter and take off. Their aerial perspective allows the film to serve up a lot of exposition about the general state of the country as the zombies take over. In this case we have a bunch of rural folk who seem to be treating the entire thing as some sort of hunting party, having a picnic, kids running around, passing around drinks, and occasionally stopping to shoot a zombie. They are soon joined by a bunch of jovial National Guard folks who essentially do the same. These scenes, including the ones in the television station and housing project, go very far to establish the different ways that the country is responding to the crisis. Compare this to Zack Snyder's 2004 remake, which stayed in the perspective of the main characters from the start and never wavered, thus losing the wider context of the world the main characters are struggling to survive in.<br /><br />After a brief interlude at a fueling station, our quartet arrive at the shopping mall. Quickly realizing that they could hole up here for a nearly indefinite amount of time in relative safety, they decide to stay. There are a number of survival tableaus and schemes in which the characters essentially \\"shop,\\" but what interests me most here is the character development.<br /><br />As they fight zombies to furnish their home in the upper floors of the mall, certain tensions between the characters develop. Stephen [David Enmgee], the helicopter pilot, seems to be jealous that he isn't as cool as the other two guys, and wants to be able to use guns and be cool like them. Scotty [Scott Reiniger] eventually becomes a bit of a daredevil, wanting to show off his skills, which leads him to make some rash decisions that put himself and others in danger. Near the end he becomes more and more mentally unstable and unable to recognize how hyped-up and volatile he is. Meanwhile, Peter [Ken Foree] stays collected, while Francine [Gaylen Ross]slowly becomes more focused and able to handle and protect herself. Romero's zombie movies have always had the distinction of really taking the situation seriously, and providing a lot of attention to the psychological effects the zombie takeover would have on his characters, which make his films richer in both depth and emotional heft, as these characters all have flaws and weaknesses. Some of them overcome them, while some do not. To me, these characters and the way they develop are what set this film apart, and make it truly fascinating. Compare this with the characters in the 2004 remake and how it is shown that they deal with the reality of the collapse of society; they make a game of shooting the zombies that look like celebrities. Whereas the characters in Romero's original bring their neuroses with them into the mall, and he gets a lot of tension and resonance out of how these petty tendencies endure even in the face of the end of the world. The characters in the remake simply get used to their situation and try to pass time. The remake is a great thriller, but just doesn't have the resonance of the original.<br /><br />A lot of people hate what they consider to be the slapstick comedy that occurs when the bikers invade the mall at the end-particularly the pie-in-the-face scene. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I thought it was a successful continuation of the theme, as it follows the line of degrees of obliviousness to the real threat. We, the audience, by that time, have learned not to underestimate the zombies, and I found it affecting to watch the foolish bikers do silly things like the pie in the face and the blood pressure machine, as it shows the downside to their casual and mocking attitude toward life, and how people with that attitude can really screw things up for others. It also provides a good contrast with the main characters, who may engage in small and petty interests, but in general work together and for a longer-term goal, as opposed to the bikers, who seem to unknowingly risk everything just for an immediate thrill. I find this moving and vital to the film, but I guess to many people a pie in the face can never be anything but slapstick.<br /><br />The movie ends without much of a resolution-only that the characters must keep moving, trying to survive-but what has come before is so involving, moving, and true-to-life that what sticks in the mind afterward are the characters, their struggles, and the hopelessness that they have fought against, rather than the gore or exploding heads, and that goes a long way toward explaining why this movie is as enduring and resonant as it is.nd protect herself.

Whereas the characters in Romero's original bring their neuroses with them into the mall, and he gets a lot of tension and resonance out of how these petty tendencies endure even in the face of the end of the world. The characters in the remake simply get used to their situation and try to pass time. The remake is a great thriller, but just doesn't have the resonance of the original.     A lot of people hate what they consider to be the slapstick comedy that occurs when the bikers invade the mall at the end-particularly the pie-in-the-face scene. It doesn't bother me. In fact, I thought it was a successful continuation of the theme, as it follows the line of degrees of obliviousness to the real threat. We, the audience, by that time, have learned not to underestimate the zombies, and I found it affecting to watch the foolish bikers do silly things like the pie in the face and the blood pressure machine, as it shows the downside to their casual and mocking attitude toward life, and how people with that attitude can really screw things up for others. It also provides a good contrast with the main characters, who may engage in small and petty interests, but in general work together and for a longer-term goal, as opposed to the bikers, who seem to unknowingly risk everything just foran immediate thrill. I find this moving and vital to the film, but I guess to many people a pie in the face can never be anything but slapstick.     The movie ends without much of a resolution-only that the characters must keep moving, trying to survive-but what has come before is so involving, moving, and true-to-life that what sticks in the mind afterward are the characters, their struggles, and the hopelessness that they have fought against, rather than the gore or exploding heads, and that goes a long way toward explaining why this movie is as enduring and resonant as it is.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|Some Pink Floyd albums grab you immediately, because the hooks are right and the melody catchy, but then get boring after too many listens. A little too safe, simple. The Final Cut is just the opposite. You don't think you'll like it, because no \\"hit\\" stands out the first time around. The closest you'll get, the punchy \\"Not Now John,\\" only appears when the album is almost over. But the sounds on the slower pieces are just too interesting to ignore, especially the way Waters' vocals grate harmonically against the melodies. Try a clip from \\"Possible Pasts,\\" for example: It starts with Waters singing over a sweet organ sound, then switches to a more muscular riff, but both times his voice strains against the music enough to make a complex tone that remains interesting after many listens. \\"Hero's Return\\" and \\"Fletcher Memorial Home\\" are also great vehicles for Waters' bitterness. The album gets under your skin.  This remastered version includes a song from the movie THE WALL as well: \\"When the Tigers Broke Free.\\"  It fits with the overall theme of the CD.
B000J4QWMC|2.0|I had vaguely wanted to see this when it was in theaters, but just never made it. Then I was reminded of it after visiting Fort Lauderdale earlier this year, and now I've seen it and I'm ready to write about it and forget it as soon as possible.<br /><br />The disc opens with the world's longest commercial for HD DVDs. It is a full three minutes long and contains what seems like full instructions to the many intricate and probably pointless \\"features\\" these discs have--like the ability to have your movie experience interrupted every few seconds by \\"fun facts\\" which probably run along the lines that Halle Berry really likes yogurt or some such. I was convinced never to buy an HD DVD after this commercial. Then we start the movie, hearing a throbbing undertone accompanying the Universal logo, then coming up out of the water until we see a bunch of catamaran-style speedboats racing along. I like movies that begin either underwater or in space. The boats speed along as the credits play. Apparently this whole section is new and exclusive to the director's cut, as from what I understand the theatrical version didn't even have credits. Oh yeah, did I mention that what I watched was the director's cut? But this is about the only point I'll be able to tell you how it's different from the theatrical version except I heard this one--at 2 hours and 20 minutes--is \\"trimmed down.\\"<br /><br />The first half hour here is police work as sensual experience. The water, the sky, the colors of the boats, all are given loving coverage. Especially the sky; I have never seen so much beautiful cloud coverage in one movie. The clouds should seriously get a credit. We notice that the two guys are often shot with one behind the other, visually making the team into one entity. This happens in the posters and artwork, too. Anyway, then they're in a nightclub [where four different songs play one after another, like in a real club; it definitely ups the verisimilitude and makes the scenes seem longer], then there's some hugger-mugger and then they're on a roof and get a call from some undercover agent whose job is going badly. Then they meet with him, then they're put on some case in order to rat out an informer. The fact is, the first 30 minutes here are absolutely incomprehensible. I went into the rest of the movie with only the vaguest motion of what was happening and why.<br /><br />Then Jamie Foxx as Rico goes to make love with Trudy, his GF and also an agent. Listen to the TOTAL porn-movie music that plays as they do it. The scene goes on so long and Trudy receives so much adoring coverage that I made a little bet that she was going to die or at least be abducted by the end.<br /><br />Then they go undercover and have to infiltrate some drug ring or something, and when the guy questions their credentials they throw this big bluff and threaten to blow up the assembled company, including themselves. I thought, Hmmm, can I do this in job interviews? \\"You want to see my portfolio? [pulls out grenade] Are you ready to meet God?\\"<br /><br />So then Rico has a talk with Trudy about how he's worried she'll be pulled into it and she tells him not to give one thought to her, but only worry about himself and Sonny, because if he thinks of her he'll be distracted and may f*** up. Pretty understanding. Then they meet the big bad guy, this semi-hot bear, and his woman Isabella, played by Gong Li. Sonny comes on hard to Isabella, quite inexplicably and unadvisedly, and they take the speedboat to Cuba for a Mojito. There they listen to music, dance, and make mad passionate love. Then they make a sub-deal to betray the big gangster and get out of the game.<br /><br />By this time one has noted that they are able to have perfectly clear cell phone conversations while in open boats traveling at high speed. And that the look of this is inextricable [which influenced which is debatable] with the Grand Theft Auto video games. And around an hour into it I thought: \\"You know,I'm getting really bored.\\"<br /><br />SPOILERS > > ><br />So a bunch of other standard cops and robbers stuff happens and, as expected, Trudy gets taken hostage. The guys divert from their plan and rescue her, after which she stupidly walks back into the trailer she was held in, which explodes, throwing her forward and leaving her in a coma and with burns over 15% of her body. Why did she go back in? Whatever. Then there's a big showdown shootout and the bad guys are killed, the good guys win, Isabella goes back to Cuba and coma girl shows signs of life.<br /><br />&lt; &lt; &lt; SPOILERS<br />It's a gorgeous blank. I don't know, I'm often not into cops and robbers movies, and this one I found a little more alienating than most. The first problem is that since the first 30 minutes are absolutely incomprehensible, no emotional connection is formed--you can't even tell what's going on. And for the rest of the movie only the barest outline of plot could be made out [by me--maybe I'm just really thick], which also keeps one disengaged. It works in a James Bond movie where you don't have to follow the plot, just watch the parade of luxury items and action pieces, but this movie seems to be going for a deep dive into the emotional lives of these cops, but it just remained distant from me. The other alienator is that I still have no clue what the basis of Sonny and Isabella's relationship is supposed to be. Why would he take this massive risk over a woman he just met, but suddenly is all passionate about? Is it just lust? I didn't engage in any of it, which left the last hour and twenty minutes as just images passing on a screen.<br /><br />It is, however, very beautiful. I don't think I've ever seen such attention paid to clouds and water and surfaces before. I think maybe he was going for this kind of haze of impressions that defines the high-stakes police experience, this kind of mental dislocation all these shifting alliances and identities leave in their agents, but after awhile character emotional distance results in audience emotional distance. Oh, and the characters never, ever seem to sleep.So a bunch of other standard cops and robbers stuff happens and, as expected, Trudy gets taken hostage.

1594489505|5.0|A wonderful book by Mr. Hosseini.  An even more captivating and heartbreaking look at the lives of Afghani women during thirty years of unending upheaval.
B000M5AJQS|3.0|I have just never responded to Scorsese [okay, I liked Kundun]. I just don't find much meaning in all that macho blustering, and I find his movies very unemotional and cold. I also just don't respond to gangster movies. I don't find them compelling at all. So this may account for my feeling of intense annoyance when walking out of The Departed.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes are fantastic. Scorsese lays out the histories of Damon as Sullivan, being a good boy and rising up the police ranks while all the time beholden to Nicholson's Boston crime boss Costello. DiCaprio has a more troubled history [during which I was never convinced WHY he wanted to be a cop], but both of their stories are laid out in a very quick and energetic way. The friend I went with was talking about the quick, staccato editing here that \\"is almost like the intro to a TV show where they tell you what happened last week,\\" but for me it really worked.<br /><br />So Damon goes on this elite police force and DiCaprio is asked to go undercover with Costello. From there it's all Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco, Donnie Brasco [okay, there's one gangster movie I responded to], with the additional wrinkle of that both guys need to discover the identity of the other one. There are lots of near-misses, lots of one-person-relaying-information-while-the-other-is-too, and gallons of macho bluster and OTT mugging from Nicholson [who wasn't quite as bad with that as I expected]. There is funny faux-Mamet patter like Alec Baldwin quickly saying \\"I'm gonna go outside and get a smoke. You want a smoke? No? What are you, some kind of fitness freak? Go f*** yourself,\\" or a guy, after being shot in the knee. Whining \\"I thought I was supposed to go into shock. I'm not in shock. It hurts!\\" that are amusing, but that's when you still believe that this story is going to come to something.<br /><br />I can't even be bothered to talk about the many twists and turns, because in the end they turn out mostly to be just time-wasters, and as we headed into the last hour I started thinking \\"Why do we need this scene? This scene could go. And what about that scene before? That was just another version of the many scenes we've seen before\\" which is not something I think any filmmaker wants the audience to be concerned with while they're watching a film.<br /><br />And finally, it just doesn't come to much. Maybe it's a case of my expectations; I thought we were building toward a big showdown between Damon and DiCaprio where they would really have at it, and then it's getting to be 30 minutes `til the end [I was definitely waiting], then 15 minutes `til the end.... And that's when I really started to turn against the movie. Which is not even to mention the overall dissatisfaction of the ending. I want to avoid giving anything away, but suffice to say that the thing I wanted to see, we did not see. And we saw a whole lot of something else that, yeah, I guess it's one worldview, but it's not a worldview I find particularly compelling or interesting. And it's kind of a worldview that you don't need two-and-a-half hours to express, and is probably why I was so bitter that I felt this movie wasted so much of my time... for that. But Scorsese seems to be unable to make a movie that is less than two-and-a-half hours, and if he did, well, how would we know that it's an important film?<br /><br />My friend [who liked it a little more than I did] asked me \\"well, how is this different from De Palma?\\" [And I was indeed sitting there wishing De Palma had directed it instead.] My answer was, well, in De Palma there is emotional content that gives me something to get involved with, whereas with Scorsese it's all tough guy blather with a little emotional stuff [here, the psychologist] thrown in for a little color, but the focus is on the guns and the cell phones and the tension and just how very hard these guys are. Wow, they sure are hard, tough guys, Marty. Wow.<br /><br />Secondly, when De Palma enters intoa set-piece, the sense I get from what's on screen [and this is highly subjective, just my feeling] is that he's inviting you, the audience, to play along and he wants you to enjoy it. The sense I get with Scorsese is that he wants you to passively sit back and admire his skill. Add that to how cold I find his films, and the sense I get is of Scorsese casting himself as the tough guy through his show-offy-yet-stand-offish technique, just as his films are filled with tough guys that he is unable to be. Yeah, yeah, Marty, you're the man, okay? Now go be the man over there.<br /><br />The final shot is a somewhat sledgehammer-subtle message that there will always be corruption in the highest offices of power. Is this a statement? Well, obviously it's a statement, but is it an interesting statement? Did we need a 150 minutes to tell us this? Especially given the current state of Congress?<br /><br />Everyone else loves this film, so take that as you may. As I said, I just don't respond to gangster movies and I just don't respond to Scorsese movies. The performances here are all very good and it's certainly well made but... take a half hour off and I'd be fine. And change the ending.reen [and this is highly subjective, just my feeling] is that he's inviting you, the audience, to play along and he wants you to enjoy it.

0316010669|4.0|I picked up this book without any expectations but I was pleasantly surprised! The book is very well written, the author has a really nice style, he gives you a lot of details but it's not boring at all, organized and narrated in an engaging way. He not only talks about a premise but he actually supports it with a lot of scientific data. I like that a lot. The premise of the book is that you can have a really good understanding of something in a very short amount of time and spending more time on it does not necessarily result in a better judgment. I was a little skeptical about this at the beginning but the author did a really good job of supporting his thesis which is rare to find. He also provides a lot of evidence on when the snap judgments can go wrong. I feel like he's not really trying to prove anything, he just puts out data supporting his thesis and he also shows how his thesis can be challenged and at the end, he lets you decide and I think this is what makes his book unique. I'd say it's a book on human psychology but written for ordinary people. It's very engaging, easy to read but at the same time, quite thought provoking.
B00003CXI1|5.0|\\"Harry Potter and SS\\" is the best fantastic movies I have watched so far. Together with the excellent skills of director Christ Columbus and well-done acting of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as three main characters, and other stellar casts,  \\"Harry Potter and SS\\" has becomes one of the most-watched movies once it's first released in the threater. The plot mainly focuses on the friendship between Harry and his two best friends, Hermione and Ron, and how they struggle throughout the movie to make the stone protected from the Lord Voldermore, an evil darkwizard. As the movie begins, Harry Potter, portraits by Daniel Radcliffe, a 10-years-old wizard is being treated so badly by his mean uncle and aunt. The Dursley's family has been concealing the fact that Harry doesn't belong in this Muggle world, and try all attempts to block all the invited letters from Hogward, a magical school where all young wizards go. It all changes, however, until his eleventh birthday when Hagrid, a giantkeykeeper of Hogward, comes and directly give him a letter, which simply says that Harry has been acccepted to attend to Hogward. Leaving the Dursley's family to go to Howard, Harry learns all about the death of his parents and begins to feel himself important as every wizard eagerly wants to shake his hands wherever he passes by. He also learns that the scar on his forhead, which makes him invulnerable from LV when he was a little baby, has made him the most famous wizard in the Wizard World. Once Harry sets foot on Hogward, a school full of matric spells, he struggles to make himself adjusted to the new World; he befriends with Ron and Hermione and other young wizards as well. Ron, who is Harry's closest companion, keeps Harry reasonable at all times and is willing to risk his life and everything he could for friendship. In the movie, you will witness how he sacrifies himself in the magnificently dangerous chessmatch in order for Harry to keep going. On the other hand, Hermione is a sensitive and very intelligent girl who really helpful throughout the movie. Thanks to her knowledgable tips, Harry could be able to choose the right potion and move on to the next door.  Perhaps, that is their friendship which makes the movie go smoothly and held my interest and curiosity 'til the end, when Harry is face-to-face with LV.......  This movie is highly recommended for all, especially for youths who are searching for adventure and fantastic movies.    Hung Duong
0375831002|5.0|As a librarian, I read a lot.  Tons.  I just finished this title and am beside myself with raw emotion for the amazing story Zusak created.  After enjoying his first novel, I was excited to read his second...they are not even in the same category.  I can't wait to share this book with anyone who will listen to my recommendation.

But I want a special edition of Grindhouse.. Planet Terror/Death Proof (just like the version of US cinemas), and the single version of the two movies im one package..... It Is really sad that american audience prefer stupid movies like Blaze of Glory... Tarantino and Rodriguez are amazing writers and directors,, and their movies always are fun...

0143038419|5.0|I took this out of the library as an audiobook, read by the author, and liked it so much I bought print copies for myself and for friends. I loved her voice, in every sense. I could feel her re-living the emotional charge of her experiences as she read to us about them. I loved vicariously learning the lessons of her journey with her, and celebrating the wonderful and creative person who emerges at the other end.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Dream Theater is a true enigma. They're the only band I can think of (and I've thought hard) who, after 20 years, still continues to climb higher and has yet to put out two albums that are alike (that's a hell of a lot more than Iron Maiden can say).  This is no exception. Systematic Chaos is not quite as heavy as Train of Thought, but decidedly heavy nonetheless.  Anyone who can listen to this CD and not be satisfied is probably a huge fan of Images and Words and Awake who wants more of that (which won't happen, sorry).  I highly recommend this disk to fans of Train of Thought and Dream Theater in general, but don't expect anything in particular.
B000002HH2|5.0|The music on \\"Post\\" is brilliant and profoundly original. Like many Bjprk albums, it stands up to repeated listenings over many years and each time it reveals something more of itself.  I have a deep respect for this artists and I think this in one of her best works.
8489367116|5.0|I am lucky to find 1 book a year that I enjoy this much. Sometimes I have to  buy 2-3 books (that I never read) to find a book I enjoy.  Shantaram is a gift to readers.  I agree with the other Amazon reviews but wish to add: I think the appeal is primarily as a \\"guys\\" book, but as a man, I cannot be completely objective, so ladies, if you wish, give it a try. (although I dont think you'll find it on Oprah's reding list.) Guys, if you have ever dreamt of being a tough, but caring fugitive, living on the edge of the dark side, but living with principals, then you can safely buy it, read it, and let it take you on a 10 year adventure of a lifetime!
B000PFUA9G|5.0|5th Gear is an awesome CD with a great mix of nostalgic songs that range from the serious to the fun songs that reflect Brad's great sense of humor. It really shows the many sides of Mr. Paisley and the instrument mix in the songs is very creative and unique. I got a big kick out of Mr. Policeman and played it on my way to work. My carpooler (who was driving) got so into it she said she felt like she needed to drive faster. It's hard to pick a favorite;  but Online, I'm Just a Guy, With You, Without You, Oh Love and the instrumental Throttleneck are some of my favorites. It's one of those CDs that you enjoy listening to over and over and hear something new each time you listen. A great musician with a voice that is very pleasing to the ear.    The Duet \\"OH Love\\" was a little different than I expected but I listened very intently to the lyrics and the harmonies and it is really a beautiful song. It is a song that is reflective of the mystery about the different levels and types of love you can experience during your lifetime. Carrie has such a rich pure voice and Brad and Carrie's voices blend beautifully on this song. It really grows on you the more you hear it and I find myself loving it more each time I listen.     If you haven't gotten this CD yet it is a must have for any fan of good music. There is something for everyone.

B000001FSP|4.0|Marianne emerged in the mid-60's as a nervous soft voiced songstress with folk inclinations, which separated her from the more pop oriented female artists of the day (Petula Clark, Cilla Black, etc.).  Her couple of albums were largely folk song covers with sparse instrumentation (comparable to Pentangle a few years later).  The endearing image was her singing perched on a stool on the show Shindig! with John Mark (later of Mark-Almond) at her feet plucking his acoustic guitar.<br />Then came the ravages of her battle with the dark side.  When seemingly she had disappeared entirely, she emerged with this dark but definitely musically modern work.  And her voice!  A contemporary rock writer compared it to Tallulah Bankhead in the middle of, well, a bad day.  Rasp personified.  \\"Why'd Ya Do It\\" was the mysterious album track that got all the attention, she appeared on Saturday Night Live with a shirt showing the song title, but did not perform it for obvious reasons.  People had to listen for, I guess, the same reason they listened intently to \\"Louie Louie\\" but in this case the vulgarity in the message was pretty plain.  All this aside, there was much here to simply enjoy, such as the magnificent \\"Ballad of Lucy Jordan.\\"  Marianne parlayed this LP into a much longer career than she originally seemed destined to achieve, as quite a few albums followed.  Her involvement with Kurt Weill works is probably the closest match of her talents to material.
1594489505|3.0|This book was just OK for me.  Hosseini is a gifted writer, but this book was predictable and workmanlike rather than surpising and delightful.  There were glimples of Hosseini's Kite Runner brillance, but they were few and far between.  I don't regret reading it, but I wanted to enjoy it more than I did.
B00006399Z|5.0|Cookin' good live album from a nice full assemblage of Traffic members.  Of course we have Messrs. Winwood, and Capaldi and Wood but also erstwhile member Dave Mason is here, Rick Grech fills in the essential bass role, and Reebop Kwaku Baah pounds the congas.  None of the stripped down trio setup that too often prevented them from performing live without assistance from non-members.  And they bring in the best of what all the members could contribute, nice Mason tunes and, oh yes, a super reprisal of the pinnacle of Steve's days with Spencer Davis (Gimme Some Lovin').
B000P2A24W|5.0|Lost Highway is just another amazing collection of songs from Bon Jovi. The best is that they continue to write their own songs, they haven't gotten stuck in a rut sticking with a specific genre of music. They tell their stories with lyrics and music that suit the feeling of the song. I've got them all, and I haven't been disappointed yet. Thanks again for something that I not only looked forward to, but enjoyed listening to several times over on just the first day. (I wore out Have a Nice Day!)
B000HT386M|2.0|This movie started out well enough but turned to multiple crude jokes that got tiresome really quickly.  Having dogs humping a stuffed duck and even Sandler once (in shadow)during sex with his wife, definitely does not make this family movie material.  As everyone has mentioned, Click does in the end, mirror the message from It's A Wonderful Life -- and for that reason, it is worth a rental.  Watch it with your favorite workaholic who is missing out on family.<br /><br />The casting was great.  Julie Kavner and Henry Winkler were perfect as the parents and the make up department did a great job of making them appear younger and older.  David Hasselhoff and Sandler's crew of regulars were totally funny in their parts but as much as I love Adam Sandler, Click was disappointing.  If it had a stronger script, it would have worked.
B000N6U1GE|5.0|This is Celine's best work in a long time, IMO. Her voice is still flawless. It's nice to hear her work with new people, too. The packaging for this album is very nice too.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I'm 48 and was a LP fan, this album is a bitter disappointment.<br /><br />The only track that even remotely resembles what I believed I was purchasing is \\"What I've Done\\". Now the radio stations have so overplayed it that it has lost it's appeal.  The reason it's overplayed?...It's because EVERY other track on this album is crap.  As some have suggested, I listened through the album three times, the first was painful, the second was irritating, the third made me mad that I had actually paid money for this \\"music\\".  Response to several tracks such as \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"Hands\\" is 'who cares?!?!?!'<br /><br />To sum it up, I tried to give this album to two co-workers and both my teenagers and no one wants it for free...<br /><br />LP, take a moment and reexamine.  This album is a bitter disappointment.  Growth is good, but if I want this kind of sound I'll listen to Diana Krall. .
006091307X|5.0|Pynchon is an author you either love or hate.  I love him, but I also understand why many people don't: one has to have a taste for absurdist humor and obscure references to really appreciate his work.<br /><br />If you're new to Pynchon, start with The Crying of Lot 49.  It's mercifully brief (152 pages), genuinely funny, and has quite a few neat concepts in it.<br /><br />Although it's often unclear what's \\"really\\" going on, this is deliberate -- the main character herself is unsure if she has stumbled upon an a grand, surreal conspiracy, or an elaborate practical joke.  The more she (and the reader) learn, the murkier things become, and there are no easy answers here.  That alone should tell you if this book is for you.<br /><br />Based on the complaints of the 1-star reviews, it's obvious that some people prefer black and white facts spoon-fed to them.  I don't doubt that they found Lot 49 confusing and inaccessible.  Like I said, Pynchon isn't for everyone -- and that's fine.  However, if you're willing to invest the effort, it's most rewarding.  I've read it several times now, and it just gets funnier.
B000BB1MIC|4.0|The producers did a very good job in portraying the growth of the characters. It is still a very good show, some might say better than when it started out.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|Stho, I thought I wasth listhening to the new Michael Buble Thee D, but insthead I got Sthylvesthter and Baba Wawa'ths offsthpring!  It sthoundths like he justhst had dental sthurgery or bracthesth insthalled right before the recording sthessthion!  I have histh other Thee Deeths and I've stheen him in concthert, but never, ever experiencthed thisth annoyancthe!!!<br /><br />Very difficult for a music lover to bear.  I can't believe that the producer would release it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I absolutely love \\"Wicked\\". I've only seen Erin Mackey and Dee Roscioli in the Chicago production, but even that was amazing.     Standouts include:     What is this Feeling  No Good Deed  Defying Gravity  Popular  For Good    Those songs were also the best acted, in my opinion.
B00004SC3M|4.0|This is one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies. Yes, I realize that \\"Entrapment\\" isn't an Academy Award-winning caliber film. It isn't  Catherine Zeta Jones or Sean Connery's best work, either, and the \\"sexual tension\\" that exists between their characters is a bit farfetched, to say the least...but I still love this movie! Despite the 600-year age difference between them, Connery and Zeta Jones play off each other brilliantly in this fun and suspenseful film about two master thieves who team up for two huge jobs. There are plenty of twists and turns in this film, and it will keep you guessing until the very end. (It will also make you wish that Zeta Jones could go back in time and play a Bond girl in \\"Goldfinger\\" or something...she and a much younger Connery would have been smoking hot on screen!)
B000P2A24W|5.0|Wow, I can't believe how good this is and how great Bon Jovi sounds. The song I Want To Make a Memory, is memorable the first time you hear it I haven't heard a memorable ballad like that in a long time. The whole cd is produced so well and sounds fantastic on headphones. I think it is really going to be liked my a large gamut of ages and music genre lovers.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|i said to a friend, before i left for the movie this evening, \\"i'm going to see a modern day musical set in ireland, called once.\\"  my friend made a fake-vomiting-face and said, \\"sounds riveting.\\"  our common understanding of musicals would dictate that \\"once\\" features one-dimensional characters who break into song for no reason, and end up living happily ever after.    not so, o jaded one.    \\"once\\" is a rare jem, an absolute heartbreaker of a masterpiece that features two real-life musicians who just happen to be able to act incredibly well.  we follow these two on their serendipitous journey from flat to recording studio to hoover repair shop.  it is a refreshing love story, wraught with awkwardness and things left unsaid (or said in czech).  and, i say with an audible sigh of relief, no big pink bow to tie up the ends in a cute package.    i got out of the movie at around ten p.m.  it's now about 1 a.m. and i'm listening to it intently, thanks to iTunes (i couldn't wait for the mail, goodness no).  every track fills my heart with almost aching joy before it slices it right down the middle.  glen hansgard is a visionary in his simplicity and his earnestness.  i suggest you see the movie.  i suggest you listen to the soundtrack, even if you don't see the movie.  i suggest you rent it when it comes out on dvd.  i suggest that you look in your heart and hope that there's something half as beautiful as this film and its music inside.
B00003CXXP|4.0|When I first saw this film back in the summer of 2001, I definitely saw more Stanley Kubrick then Steven Spielberg like alot of people did, but then again this was Kubrick's dream project for many many years. And after he died, Spielberg figured the best way to honor Kubrick was to make this film.<br /><br />Set in the not-so-far future where humans can make realistic robots (called mechas) comes an interesting take on the famous fairy tale Pinocchio.<br /><br />David (wonderfully played by Haley Joel Osment) is the first of his kind,an artificial kid which is the first to have real feelings,who really wants to be a real boy.<br /><br />I still don't understand why no-one really liked this film,yes it's long but I love long films. I guess people weren't ready for a film like this or the fact it was a weird combination of two director's styles.<br /><br />But overall I found this a very enjoyable film and thought Haley Joel Osment should have gotten an nomination for his wonderful and heartbraking performance.And if you watch him very closely,throught out the whole film,he never blinks his eyes.
1594489505|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the \\"Kite Runner\\" so I was very excited to finally read this book when it came out. It did not disappoint me! The story was so moving and the range of emotions this story takes you through was incredible. It definitely made me sit back and realize how privileged I am to be a woman in this country. So far this is definitely my favorite book this year and I look forward to many more books from Khaled Hosseini.
B000JSI7AI|5.0|Over time we have seen expressions of beauty created by men and women that we want to perserve.  In our time it's not so much a painting as it is and in the future will be certain films.  This is one of those films.  It's not groundbreaking as one is often lead to believe because it's not really approaching the idea of love that differently.  When two people are in love there is nothing that can stop the expression of that love.  This is an example of that desire to jump the hurdles.  Someone said that the two shirts that went on sale on ebay and sold for 101,000 dollars was because they were the ruby slippers of our time.  Well I believe is film is the Romeo and Juliet of our time, and who cannot help but fall under the spell of that.    That said,  I've read all about the mumbling (from those below) that Heath Ledger did during his performance.  The mumbling is suppose to represent is inability to let go and be with his lover, it is the phyiscal manifestation of the feelings inside.    As for Jake his performance is so honest, so urgent.  His need to be with Ennis is so powerful that he'll risk everything.    The rest of the cast is supurb and the story is faithful to the amazing short story.  The direction from Ang Lee is as usual impecable and awe inspiring.    It will break your heart but it will also remind why we risk our heart in the first place.  For those few moments not where you're waiting to begin what is suppose to be the \\"happy part of the rest of your life\\" but the happy moments we have for just a moment with that one person we can't live without.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I had diminished expectations about this film. After renting it, I purchased it. The message is timeless and quite appropriate for the current mess that has engulfed the US. Freedom can be supressed for a time but not forever. I so admire the strength of spirit and the fearlessness of the character in this story. Courage seems today to be delegated as 'quaint and obsolete'. We need to have heroes, not of fiction, but as inspiration to those who have more than their own self-interest at heart.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This album is about as close to magic and music can possibly come. It's a bit slow motion for some people, and some people find that sad, but to me it's like a spiritual awakening of sorts. Go to you tube and check out some songs there!en 1967-1977, when progressive rock was literally a top ten chart topping phenomenon.      In the end, this is all \\"pretentious\\" means when used by such critics: they don't like the styles of music that exist midway between folk and classical, or rock and jazz, or whatever and whatever. I love music rooted in pop, rock, and folk that is embellished by all sorts of influences from more complicated genres. I love the fact that a song can swing from a gentle little folk tune to a complicated instrumental movement. I also love the storytelling aspect of longer pieces of music and concept albums-- it gives the lyricist more time to stretch out and explore a theme. These artists are not trying to be something that they are not, they are being exactly what they ARE: pop artists with ears open to other influences. This happened as soon as Paul McCartney (in 1967) came into the studio after hearing a classical work with a Bach trumpet, and he wrote and plopped a similar trumpet arrangement in \\"Penny Lane.\\" It happened when Brian Wilson crumbled the Beach Boys formulaic song structure (1966) and started to record his collage piece SMiLE. And then for ten odd years after, much of the best of rock music had similar boundary-breaking tendencies.      Sigur Ros is very much in the art-rock category. You can see their lead singer from one or two vantage points (albeit extreme ones): either he is the most otherworldly supremely beautiful gift to pop music that has ever happened, or he is a pretentious pseudo-opera singer. And really, which vantage you choose depends on whether or not you are moved by his work. You can tell which camp I fit in-- I think he's one of the most important pop artists on the planet, and you'd have to be crazy not to at least give him a chance to work his magic on you. Buy this record--- TODAY!
B000O599XK|4.0|I believe at this point in time I'm unique in that I seem to be the only reviewer who's going to attempt a comprehensive review of the Two-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition of Rio Bravo. Since I also own the original DVD release, I can compare the two prints (although to be honest, I loaned it to my Russian doctoral advisor a few years ago and he seems loath to part with it; however, the extras include unrestored scenes which can form the basis). We all KNOW that this is \\"the greatest Western that John Ford never made,\\" otherwise, why would we be on this page? So rather than preach to the converted (which is basically a waste of time), this review will concentrate on the extras and the print itself.  To be honest, I prefer the older release for print quality. Given that this film was shot in Technicolor, I assumed that Warner would do the right thing and not tweak the original color values (I'm guessing that Rio Bravo wouldn't be a candidate for Warner/AOL's Edge Enhancement restoration because it was probably shot on one strip of film rather than three). But this print looks way too dark compared to the first release, with a rather significant loss of detail in the night and interior shots. To be honest, the detail is excellent in the brighter shots, but overall, I think the earlier release looks better and is immediately recognizable as Technicolor; this one almost looks like it's DeLuxe or Eastman. Okay...maybe it's not quite THAT bad, but I don't think it's an upgrade--everyone is orange, including the horses.  I don't know exactly what the stated audio restoration entailed, but it sounds great. There's an excellent commentary by Richard Schickel and John Carpenter (who are clearly having the time of their lives), an alternate French audio track, and subtitles in English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and--of all things--Korean. There are also a number of trailers for Wayne's B westerns, culminating in one for Rio Bravo.  The extras on the second disk include three documentaries which are all deserving of the proverbial enthusiastic thumbs-up. The first is an installment of Schickel's series The Men Who Made the Movies which focuses on Howard Hawks; the second is titled Commemoration: Howard Hawks' [sic] Rio Bravo that features (among others) the ubiquitous Peter Bogdanovich (whom I find irritating almost beyond enduring) and Walter Hill and which, despite my aversion, I found enjoyable; everyone involved is a serious Rio Bravo fan and has something of interest to contribute. The final installment is called Old Tucson: Where the Legends Walked; this tells the story of what was to become the Old Tucson Studio and which is the location on which Rio Bravo was shot. This was all new to me and, like the other two documentaries, was lots of fun. For those interested, there are Portuguese and Korean subtitles.  We now come to the non-video extras. You may have read mention of \\"a comic book\\" that's included with this set. What ISN'T mentioned is that it's a miniature reprint of a 10¢ Dell comic book that was issued for sale concurrent with the film's theatrical release (these weren't uncommon during that time period, now that I think of it). Also included is a miniature of what looks to be a promotional catalogue intended for theater owners, explaining how best to promote the film.  Finally, there's a nice set of miniature theater cards that somehow managed to get a tad mangled in their sleeve. Since the trays that hold the disks were damaged when I received my set and are therefore being returned, I'm hoping for better things next time around. Everything is beautifully packaged as a series of folders within a heavy, vellum-textured slipcase.  I was lucky enough to purchase this with a coupon for about the same price as the list for the Two-Disc Special Edition, so I decided to go for it (I'm a sucker for gimmicks). I don't know if I'd advise purchasing it at list as the extras, while nice, aren't essential. In fact, I don't evenknow that this new release is essential. If you already own the original release, there's really no reason to go for this one unless you want the documentaries and commentary. I knocked off a star because I'm really not crazy about the print, there's no hard-copy chapter index (a major pain in the posterior, in my book), the menus are cheesy, plus it's impossible to turn off the audio commentary unless the disk is ejected. Regardless of which release you purchase, Rio Bravo is not only a must-have for anyone who claims to be a Western fan, it belongs in the library of every serious film buff.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|Rush is known for songs that have great lyrics and great melodies.  I haven't found that in Snakes and Arrows.  All I hear is a bunch of instruments that sound like they were blended in a digital food processor and spit out in some kind of smooth electronic stream.  None of these songs are good, none could be sung along with in concert, none have catchy lyrics or melodies to them.   I am a die hard Rush fan going back to my high school days in the early 80's, and I am a huge Neil Peart fan, both his music and his motorcycling books.  Therefore I am more dissapointed than most with this album.
B000MV9026|5.0|Great, awesome, cute, really cute and foot stomping good time watching this movie. The animals are the cutest and most adorable little darlings. I especially like the dancing. Am nuts about Robin Williams! Great movie!
B0000028WD|5.0|I was living in NYC and working when I heard this concert announced on the radio. Sold out in minutes! Never did get a ticket, much to my regret but this cd and the accompanying video make me feel as if I was there to celebrate the music of Bob Dylan or as Neil Young proclaimed, 'Bobfest!'. Rarely a week goes by when I don't listen to a few tunes from this concert. The collection of artists could make the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame quake in it's boots. John Mellencamp kicks things off in high gear with LIKE A ROLLING STONE. My other favorites are Richie Havens, JUST LIKE A WOMAN. Eddie Vedder, MASTERS OF WAR. The Clancy Brothers really kick it in with, WHEN THE SHIP COMES IN and Shawn Colvin kicks a** with YOU AIN'T GOING NOWHERE. The Band WHEN I PAINT MY MASTERPIECE and what a finish with MY BACK PAGES and KNOCKING ON HEAVENS DOOR. My only regret about this cd is someone should have edited Stevie Wonder's ranting before he kicks off BLOWIN IN THE WIND. Political rants don't belong on this cd, it's all about celebrating the songs of one of our greatest artist.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|just one comment for this album..... this sucks, from begining to end. It's something more melancolic than this???.... ahhh yes, F***g Justin Timberlake

0786852550|5.0|London, sometime near now.  Magic exists, and magicians control the government.  To do this, they must summon \\"demons\\", creatures from higher dimensions, to do their bidding.  They maintain power through fear and intimidation of both their human subjects and their more powerful slaves.      Enter Nathaniel, eleven-year old wizard, and apprentice to a junior government magician.  He's been humiliated by Simon Lovelace, another, more powerful magician, and wants revenge.  He summons Bartimaeus, a sly, wisecracking djinni, to steal a powerful artifact, the Amulet of Samarkand, from Lovelace's residence.  Bartimaeus does this and at Nathaniel's bidding hides it in his master's office.    In the process, Bartimaeus learns Nathaniel's birth name.  And then the fun really begins...    I was looking for a good fantasy series to tide me over until the release of the Harry Potter finale when I happened upon \\"The Amulet of Samarkand\\".  Since then I have read it twice, and listened to the brilliant audiobook reading of it.  This is one of the best fantasies ever written, and will always have a place in my collection.    It's as though the world of Harry Potter were taken over by the Slytherins, only much more evil.  The magicians in this series are almost all conniving, sneaky, backstabbing, selfish gits.  It's hard to like any of them.  But it is fun to watch their machinations, especially through the eyes of the eternally jaded, sarcastic Bartimaeus.      Harry Potter, with a little 1984 and Wizard of Earthsea thrown in.  Read this series.  You won't be disappointed.
0060935464|3.0|This is a classic that most of us read back when we were in High School.  I read it way back \\"in the day\\" as my husband says, then just re-read it as a book club selection this month.  And while I enjoyed the story, sadly it just didn't live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading about this time period.  The novel is set during the depression in Alabama.  I liked Scout, the narrator's, voice, and the way she tells her story.  I thought her father, Atticus (what a great name), their cook Calpurnia and the neighbor Miss Maudie Atkinson were wonderful and endearing characters.<br /><br />There are many good lessons, some great symbolism and good topics for discussion...there is much to enjoy in this book.  But as I've said with another book I recently read, I think that I am not the intended audience for this novel.<br /><br />I really think that this book should be read by young people who are figuring out the world and the complexities of class structure, discrimination and moral values and who may still be able to think that most things in life are black and white.  I think it will have a greater impact for them than for more mature readers who already see things in shades of gray.
B000000Y2F|5.0|The Five Spot in 1957 Thelonious Monk playing live at one of his favorite gigs. Before they became jazz legends Monk and John Coltrane jam on 3 songs. This is a classic jazz recording and one of the few where Monk and Coltrane play together. But check this out you also have Coleman Hawkins on tenor sax, Art Blakey, before his Jazz Messengers days, on drums, Wilbur Ware on bass. Great music.
0385486804|1.0|Please...enough with the gushing reviews, this book doesn't deserve them. I'll admit it is well written, but in the end, an empty experience. This is a book about searching for revelation, instead of actually having one. It is typical of the over thought, overwrought, self-searching school of writing that has become the center of the publishing business of late. The writer obviously nurses a strong fascination with the \\"wild\\" but only as something to be overcome, to challenge oneself against. He also appears to think the only noble or worthy death is one dealt by \\"nature.\\" There is a strong vein of arrogance toward nature in this stance, one that is hard to stomach. The narrative itself tries to shoehorn meaning from the act of a confused elitist child who thought the wild was just something to overcome in his march toward dominating the world. Read The Last Gentleman Adventurer: Coming of Age in the Arctic by Edward Beauclerk Maurice, for a book about what it really means to be a man among nature.
0307237699|4.0|Here in the U.K I guess I get a very different view of your Country. They say an outsider can easily and quickly see things its hard to see in yourself. Well, I study U.S history and politics here in England and I like to think I understand the subject of power in the U.S. fairly well. So here is my humble opinion on this book and the upcoming election.    First of all It should be understood the depth of hatred the world feels towards George W Bush. As an Englishman, like all English people, we share your history, language and a lot of your culture. We are (generally) forever on your side, no matter the costs to our country. As one of the first to join any American coalition militarily or economically, the brits are fighting your corner. The last few years, despite our Prime Minister Mr Blair's view and standpoint, the vast majority of our people do not want to see british or American soldiers in Iraq and we are sick of the whole war, the policies of our leaders and we worry for the future security of the Nation. George W Bush is the most unpopular President with the British people and is universally despised and ridiculed. Personally, I have yet to meet one British citizen who has any view other than hatred for this man. Many, many people felt cheated and disgusted when he was elected in 2004 and angry that the American people had elected this man again. So what can anyone do to stop this cynism and hope for a better future for your country and for the security of Nations like ours? well, vote Democrat for a start. Will Obama be a good choice?     This book is titled under various chapters that deal with specific issues facing the future President. i.e    1. Republicans and Democrats  2. Values  3. Our Constitution  4. Politics  4. Opportunity  5. Faith  6. Race  7. The world beyond our borders (foreign policy)  8. Family    I have to say that with the exception of maybe two chapters, Obama is not giving much away regarding any plans for the Presidency or his policies. Like many people tired of the Bush administrations lies and incomptency, I would love to see this man be elected to office. I have always been a democratic liberal and agree with basically everything he has to say. But although I can't vote in the U.S of course, even if I could, Obama has not convinced me too much of what he plans to do in steps towards making the world a better place.   Senator Obama is an eloquent and educated man, with a seeming humility and forthright honesty rarely seen or heard since the days of Truman and JFK. This is refreshing to hear and gives me hope for the future, but he is not really saying very much in particular and offers no visions other than a kind of; let's do the right things, be nice and it'll all work out fine. I realise politicians give little away before elections for fear of alienating a proportion of voters, but Obama has told us hardly anything at all. He is in the mould of JFK (no bad thing I admit) and he reminds me of him in many ways. He is the kind of all-things-to-all-people type of politician. Like JFK, he appears to be the kind of President you would like to get a beer with and is regular nice guy, but would be a bit short on firm action or firm policy as leader of the free world. Like Mr Kennedy, he's likeable, It's all inspiring rhetoric and good news, but dude.......where's the beef?      Having said this, it's an enjoyable read and full of inspirational words. it's well written and cohesive in its arguments for change. I do hope that he stands a chance of winning but i doubt it. In my opinion America will never have a black President, at least not in my lifetime, no matter who he is or what he stands for. Its sad but true, the hard-right, christian, white, monied majority rule America and the rest of it can hang for any chance of a real say in how the USA and (consequently our world) is run. It makes me sad to say this but its true.    Good Luck Obama. and good luck America 2008 !
1594489505|5.0|but this story brings it so much closer.  I think that women in all parts of the world face many challenges. Mariam and Laila are faced with their own challenges and incredible hardships and in the end there strength (which I greatly admire) and love for each other will have you weeping.  The book also explains about the struggle in Afghanistan between its people and the effects of all of the different invasions that it has withstood. This book left me thinking about what the final ending will be for Laila.  What will happen in/to Afghanistan next?  Will the Taliban rise again? etc.  Any book that leaves you thinking is a good book...

It didn't take but a moment for me to slip in MOONDANCE and so the night only got better from there. Smooth, mellow, rocking, with more soul then a Southern Baptist Church on a Sunday afternoon. No fillers here. Every song with a legacy of it's own. If music is the food of the gods then this one is a gift from the gods. Give it a listen and feel the rapture.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Although it's only twice as powerful as the built-in flash on the D40, and even though I probably won't use it that much, the ability to bounce flash with this will be invaluable for indoor shots, especially family gatherings and kids (if I ever have any). It's so small and light that I just carry it everywhere, even if I most likely won't use it. This is a truly practical product. Great work Nikon!
B000O179EA|5.0|Suffice to say that if you are into HD and especially HD-DVD and have a big screen, I mean 100\\" or above then this is why you got into HD.<br /><br />The video transfer is superb, a couple of very minor film artifacts here and there but nothing to write home about.<br /><br />The audio transfer is also a knockout.<br /><br />Just get it you will not be dissapointed.
B000MZHW40|5.0|Greed is the dark heart of \\"Blood Diamond,\\" director Edward Zwick's (\\"The Last Samurai\\") uncompromising look into the underground trafficking of illegally-traded gems in sub-Saharan Africa.  Greed of corrupt men for power, greed of an amoral mercenary willing to sacrifice anything for a chance to escape Africa, greed of Western businessmen who seek to artificially control the diamond market, and the greed of a simple man for his family's return.  This movie powerfully demonstrates the valuelessness of a human life to those persons obsessed with blood diamond collection in war-ravaged Sierra Leone.<br /><br />Djimon Hounsou plays Solomon Vandy, a simple fisherman and father of two who witnesses his idyllic existence crumble before his eyes.  Rebels seeking new recruits, slaves, and random carnage swarm into his village.  They select his adolescent son and other young men as future cadets in their guerilla army--following suitable brainwashing and manipulation techniques--before then getting down to the real business of slave collection.  Seemingly devoid of any mental workings besides casual sadism, these bandits top-off their kidnapping and slave-taking exercise with the mutilation and execution of men deemed too troublesome for them to bother with.  Vandy is rescued from dismemberment at the last minute when the rebels recognize his strength, seeing it as an asset they can utilize in their constant search for capital:  the blood diamond pits.  Condemned to toiling underneath the blazing sun with nary a chance of reaping any benefit (besides possible continued survival) for his efforts, Vandy happens to discover an egg-sized blood diamond hidden in the streambed.  Hiding it underneath his foot, he buries it when the rebel encampment is attacked by government troops.  The only witness to his \\"theft\\" is the wounded slave captain--now captured, along with Vandy, by government forces--who swears that the former fisherman will soon be begging to reveal the diamond's whereabouts.<br /><br />Parallel to Djimon's character's storyline is the tale of Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), an opportunistic solider of fortune caught within a dichotomy of conflicting motivation.  He desires escape from Africa at any cost, yet secretly knows that his blood will someday mix with the earth of his homeland.  Perhaps it is this realization that he is doomed which propels Archer forward:  in every action and every word, he seems to be daring destiny to obliterate him.  Taken in and trained from a young age by Colonel Coetzee (Arnold Vosloo), Archer is easily the most dangerous entity alive on the continent:  ruthless, misanthropic, callous, manipulative, and incredibly lethal with bullet and blade.  After a close-call haggling with rebel leaders over fair prices for blood diamonds, Archer is arrested for smuggling while crossing the Sierra Leone border.  It is here that he intercepts the distraught Vandy and begins weaving a plan to save himself from the war-torn country:  by dangling the freedom of the fisherman's family as bait to cajole Vandy into revealing the gigantic diamond's location.  Solomon, though a simple man, is not so easily fooled.  He eventually agrees to help Archer--but only if the mercenary agrees to help locate his family and also permit Solomon to be his travel companion.<br /><br />There is barely time for indrawn breath during the watching of this movie.  Action sequences are furious, brutal, and frequent.  The pace of the movie is frenetic.  The score is perfect throughout.  The \\"education\\" of Vandy's son by the rebels is heart-wrenching.  Solomon's overarching belief that fatherhood trumps all initially feels naïve, but is eventually revealed to be the singularly most powerful force in the entire movie.  Danny's character--the realist mercenary who seems most capable of surviving, when compared to Vandy--shows the most evolution, shedding layers of the personality onion until an actual human appears.  He is moved to revealan element of his past to the beautiful American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), whose persistence and mutual survivorship cements a bond they both were too proud to admit from their first meeting.  Archer and Vandy relationship morphs into something beautiful when a sacrifice is needed, prompting Solomon to reverse that remarkably chauvinistic statement made by Rudyard Kipling over one hundred years ago:  the \\"white man's burden.\\"<br /><br />This is hands-down Djimon's most impressive performance:  I have never seen him better represent a character.  In fact, he blurs the line between character and actor, totally suspending my disbelief to the point where I \\"knew\\" him only as Vandy.  I have been told by an acquaintance--currently living in Zimbabwe (formerly Rhodesia)--that DiCaprio's accent is spot-on.  In addition, he was utterly believable as heartless mercenary, and his later transformation was also quite convincing.  The action sequences were, as mentioned, jaw-dropping in their intensity, but never felt gratuitous or over-the-top.<br /><br />Easily one of my five favorite movies of 2006--miss it, and you risk missing some of the finest cinematographic wizardry and directorial finesse of cinema from the last year, period.to the beautiful American reporter (Jennifer Connelly), whose persistence and mutual survivorship cements a bond they both were too proud to admit from their first meeting.

Easily one of my five favorite movies of 2006--miss it, and you risk missing some of the finest cinematographic wizardry and directorial finesse of cinema from the last year, period.
0553565915|3.0|This book was given to me by a friend who called it \\"life changing\\"... for me, not so much.<br />As a story, it's a nice tale... but it begs all sorts of questions if it's to be taken as a true autobiographical experience.<br /><br />You know how when you were reading \\"A million little pieces\\" you found yourself totally NOT believing that someone experienced root canal without sedation or pain control of any kind?  I think you might find yourself with similar thoughts of disbelief here too...  Perhaps it's just the medical professional in me that finds a lot of her accounts to be improbable, but I suspect even a layperson would have to wonder how legitimate her death (or near death) experience really was.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for it's cheerful anecdotes with caution to the reader that much of what you are about to read is based on a wonderful imagination and the authors cunning ability to share it with us.
0679735909|1.0|I've read a few short stories by Ms. Byatt and found them all to be intriguing, thus, I had high hopes that this book would be interesting and unique - an intelligent, romantic novel perhaps.  I was wrong, so wrong.  The first third of the book moved quite slowly.  The reader gets introduced to two literary scholars one (a man) who studies a famous male Victorian poet and the other (a woman) who studies a famous female Victorian poet.  I didn't like either scholar. The central one-third of the book is dedicated to 'uncovering' lost love letters that the poets wrote to each other.  The letters are boring, the poetry is bad, the thoughts about religious agnosticism are anachronistic.  Now, two-thirds of the way through the book, I have decided that I don't like the Victorian poets either and couldn't care less if they loved each other or committed mass murder.  The last third of the book brings the reader back to the present with our literary scholars dealing with academic politics, a budding romance and growing academic reputations based on finding the lost letters of the Victorian poets.      I didn't like the book because there was no humor or humility in any of the characters.  The atmosphere of the book was very chilly.  No one is ever warm or comfortable or happy.  I hated this book. I would have been better off reading a sappy romance with stilted writing.
B0009LNRL4|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />When those fortunate enough to have experienced the works of Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l and Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II are asked to articulate their thoughts, emotions almost explode waiting to tell you about the experimental records from 1970 and 1971 \\"Yeti\\" and \\"Tanz der Lemminge.\\"  \\"Phallus Dei\\" from 1969 can play in the same yard anytime.<br /><br />Taking pages from progressive rock, psychedelic, avant-garde, improvisational, and the German underground scene, Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l and Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II releases offer an attack on your senses with intense musical compositions.  Their works aren't thought of as individuals songs but a total package of sounds and landscapes that take your to other spectrums.<br /><br />This particular release depending on the pressing has the title track (Over 20 minutes) either as the first song or the last.  Either way the continuity isn't broken.  The structure of the songs allow for interchangeable parts.  This ride is a marathon and not a sprint.<br /><br />On track three you can hear a bit of the Jefferson Airplane (Think \\"Volunteers\\").  With the plethora of styles that influence the sound the band is strong enough on every account to not emanate a borrowed or tired vibe but a unique one that has stood the test of time.<br /><br />Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l and Amon D&uuml;&uuml;l II didn't concern themselves with toping the charts but they did have a terrific philosophy of being proud of the end result.  If you get the pressing that contains the two bonus tracks \\"TouchMaPhal\\" and \\"I Want The Sun To Shine\\" the definitive version will be yours.  Excellent quality and twenty minutes more of their musical odyssey.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
0743298020|5.0|Curled up in bed, late one night, I began reading this book, thinking it would help ease me to sleep.  Was I ever wrong.  Like a lyrical cross between the Brothers Grimm and a storytelling by Grandma, this book had me hooked.  Sleep was fought off while I devoured this wonderful tale.  With numerous twists, turns, and \\"Oh my gosh!\\" moments, The Thirteenth Tale provided me with hours of entertainment.
0393061310|5.0|This is a book which certainly brings a reaction out of people, judging by the number of extreme votes for it, good and bad.  For one more opinion though:<br />I picked up this book (in German it's called 'Arm und Reich' - Poor and Rich) in a bargain bin for 1 euro, and must confess that I had never heard of it before, so my impression was completely unbiased.  Now it has a place on my bookshelf alongside Darwin's Origin of Species and Paine's The Age of Reason, and a couple other classics which have given us a truer picture of our world.  I disagree with those who claim Jared Diamond has some agenda he is trying to push.  It is a completely objective analysis by someone venturing into a field many shy away from.  Many of those voting low seem to betray some sort of prejudice or preconceived notions that they cannot get rid of, forgetting that it is historical fact that their ancestors were ignorant primitives when the greatest civilizations existed in the Middle East.  But even those who refuse to believe that it is anything other than genetic advantage that landed the racial groups where they are today economically, socially, etc can take heart from this book.  That's because the book also shows that Europe's drive to colonization was not the result of them being particularly evil slave-drivers and that way inclined, but simply naturally followed from their own history and technological stand.  Any population group that expands enough to place a pressure on its original boundaries will colonize at some point, and many of history's previous colonizations left no survivors, e.g. the Asiatic colonization of Polynesia.<br /><br />Note that Jared doesn't imply that these are the ONLY causes behind Europe's technological lead in comparison with other racial groups, but the main ones, which I must agree with.  There are, however, other factors which probably played a role too, which are not mentioned in the book, such as climate, for example.  The book also demonstrates the fallacy of 'racial purity' as leading to any kind of advantage.  The purest races today remain pure-blooded Aborigines and Hottentots, who made little technological progress over many millennia, while Europeans, who are so mixed it is ridiculous to even start discussing their racial purity, made a great contribution.  Racial mixing is vital to increased insight, creativity and intelligence, and is probably one of the main reasons behind the USA's massive leap forward in the 20th century, compared with other inbred, 'racially pure' countries.  I believe that if this book were made required reading in schools, there'd be a lot less racial hatred around than there is today.acy of 'racial purity' as leading to any kind of advantage.

1400031362|5.0|I just love the series of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency.  What has always impressed me about these books is how no person is simply a one-dimensional character.  Maids, cooks, Important Government Men, fiancees, children and garage apprentices all have complex motives and emotions.  How human.
B000244FDW|5.0|Of the three recent (past 20 some years) versions of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", this one most accurately reflects both the words and spirit of the original story by Jane Austen.  The recent movie version with Keira Knightley, while a good movie in itself, was more like Charlotte Bronte's writing than Jane Austen - very dramatic.  The A&E version was my least favorite of the three.  If you want the real Elizabeth Bennett, this is it.
0743496728|2.0|I could NOT get into the book. The going back and forth in time, and places, and the names...I forgot who was who.

Hell, you might as well purchase it, because it is definitely worth every penny and I promise you won't regret it.  It is a true classic and a movie you will want to see over and over again.  God knows I must have viewed this one at least a dozen times now.  The acting, directing, writing, score, etc... is top notch.  Am I the only person out there who constantly poses this question - WHY DONT THEY MAKE FILMS LIKE THIS ANYMORE?  Then again, there has never been, nor will there ever be, an actor quite like Paul Newman.  And if ever there was a role in which Newman was born to play, this was it!  Seriously folks, could you even imagine another actor playing the part of Luke?  It's definitely one of his finest performances ever.  The man has charm oozing out of every pore in his body.<br /><br />Along with the outstanding, understated work of Mr. Newman, this film also contains several wonderful performances by a fine supporting cast - George Kennedy (Best Supporting Actor Winner as Dragline), Strother Martin, Robert Donner, Morgan Woodward, Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Harry Dean Stanton, Dennis Hopper and Jo Van Fleet as Luke's mother Arletta.  By the way, the scene in which Luke confronts his dying mother Arletta is one of my favorites of all-time.  It redefines the word POIGNANT and I can almost guaranty it will melt your heart.<br /><br />There are so many famous lines and scenes in this movie that make this film completely unforgettable.  I have yet to meet one person (male or female) that didn't thoroughly enjoy this film from begining to end.  For those of you who haven't seen it yet, you are in for a treat.  I still remember the first time I saw this film and how much I enjoyed it.  In fact, the very next day I went to the video store (sorry Amazon, you weren't around yet) and immediately purchased it.  Trust me folks, this is one EXCEPTIONAL film.<br /><br />Finally, I think we sometimes forget just how many classic films Paul Newman has been in - \\"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"The Hustler\\", \\"Hud\\", \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", \\"The Sting\\", \\"Abscence of Malice\\", \\"The Verdict\\", \\"The Color of Money\\", \\"Nobody's Fool\\", etc... etc... etc...  The man is a living legend and one hell of a good human being to boot!  At 82 years old, he just announced his retirement from acting.  I don't know about the rest of you out there, but I for one feel like I am losing an old, dear friend.many classic films Paul Newman has been in - \\"Cat On A Hot Tin Roof\\", \\"The Hustler\\", \\"Hud\\", \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\", \\"The Sting\\", \\"Abscence of Malice\\", \\"The Verdict\\", \\"The Color of Money\\", \\"Nobody's Fool\\", etc... etc... etc...

0142000655|5.0|This is a phenomenal novel.  The crowning achievement of Steinbeck's lexicon of inspired work.  The book is operatic, pondering the burden of free will and spanning generations of a family that constantly struggles to escape itself.  It is fully American, fully human, and fully a religious experience.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be moved, inspired, and find their new favorite book.

B000002KDG|5.0|First let me mention that John Morgan's review below was an exciting read.  I love those kind of reviews!    My review won't be as good, but I want to give a shout out to a very good rock artist- Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.  Whoops, I meant, Neil Young and Crazy Horse.  hehe    Rust Never Sleeps was a very popular record for Neil Young back in the late 70's.  My dad thinks it was Neil's most popular album, but I can't say whether there's any truth to that.    Anyway, everyone knows track one.  It's great.  A dark, creepy and interesting tune that one is.  \\"Thrasher\\" is almost straight-up country, and it's very good.  I enjoy it.  \\"Pocahontas\\" almost brings me to tears with its amazing beauty, along with \\"Sail Away\\".      After that, the album starts rocking out.  Funny how it's a gradual build.  \\"Powderfinger\\" shows what's straight ahead- hard rock dominated by none other than guitars.  \\"Welfare Mothers\\" is catchy and \\"Sedan Delivery\\" is an acquired taste, but numerous plays reveals a highly enjoyable song.  It's strangely written, which might turn people off at first.  \\"Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)\\" is like the first song but with heavy guitars thrown in, painting a darker image.      Neil at his best?  Maybe.
0375704027|3.0|The beginning and middle of the book was good.  Great character description and strong story line.  I was pleased -however, three quarters through to the end the author started with heavy duty sex descripton which eventually tainted the characters . Why did he choose to do this . The characters were unique,strong and purposeful without all the sleeze. Too much Murakami--Americans like storylines and romantanic and yes, sex but not sleeze!!I was quite bored especially when Reiko --the older ,wrinkled lady got involved .What was the purpose of that? just sleeze!
B000PKG6TE|4.0|There are very few albums that I can listen to from start to finish, over and over, and still claim to like most of the songs.  Era Vulagris is one of those rare finds.  I cannot stop listening.  I can honestly say that there is only one song on the album that I don't care for -- Battery Acid.  Standouts:  Turning On the Screw, Sick Sick Sick, Into the Hollow, Make it Wit Chu, and my fav, Suture Up Your Future.  Definitely a must-have for both the new QOTSA fans and the ever-faithfuls.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I've been harboring some resentment against these two ever since they got real popular about five years back, and started to decline (slightly) into fame. When I heard that Jack and Meg were ditching their old fashioned style of reel to reel recording, and finally going digital I pretty much disowned them. Hearing the single initially didn't help much either, with the Limp Bizkit meets weird al rap hooks... I thought it was all done. Then a friend of mine gave me the CD, just to say..LISTEN.. and then...<br /><br />I am pleased to say once again that The White Stripes rock. They are a pretty damned cool little duo. Forget that The White Stripes now record in digital.. because its more like digital went White Stripe than it is the other way around. Amazing collection of sounds are put together on this album, spanning the sounds of popular music from the last hundred years (so i read) and really, where the last two albums have lacked somewhat, this album really shines... its full, and its packed with variety, that still flows remarkably well. Makes much of the`last two efforts seem flat in comparison. Maybe us oldschoolers are wrong about the digital age. Apparently it just takes someone to know what to do with it.<br />Highlights for me are mainly in the second half with the pounding LITTLE CREAM SODA.. the plainly awesome RAG AND BONE (defies me...\\"if you dont want it, we'll take it!\\") and SLOWLY TURNING INTO YOU, but the first half is cool too with amazingly different, but familiar songs like CONQUEST (sort of an old time mamba thing going on?) 300MPH, a \\"thumper\\", the poppy YOU DONT KNOW WHAT LOVE IS, and even the title track quickly grows on you (I have some problems with the lyrics in the third verse, they just sound stupid to me.. minor complaint) ..The two halves are split by a two part indian number, one half jacks and one half megs, its interesting.<br />All in all, The White Stripes have won me over again (and I always love watching meg bounce when she plays those drums!) ...Very good stuff... don't delay. Five....Very good stuff... don't delay. Five.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|I'm mostly a classic rock fan stuck in the 60's and 70's, but Weezer caught my attention upon immediately hearing them for their talent at writing hooky pop songs.  They are really good at writing memorable tunes, and they deserve respect for that.
B000002KIE|5.0|This Sex Pistols CD is fantastic,and (to me anyway) has aged well. I still find it rousing and energizing.<br /><br />Johnny's voice is snide and proud. Why shouldn't it be , he had the best set of rags a punk at the time could wear, but getting back to the music and his voice, it's just a very well put together collection.<br /><br />I love his opening of \\"Anarchy\\" with his sarcastic, sinister chuckle!<br /><br />I agree that The Sex Pistols are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT musically than The Clash who are New Wave music ,like Blondie.<br /><br /> \\"Classic Vintage Punk\\"  is what I consider The Sex Pistols, and this CD is EXCELLENT !<br /><br />\\"Anarchy\\", \\"God Save the Queen\\" are real pioneer songs now. The political venom of the period.<br /><br />Also \\"Submission\\" and \\"Pretty Vacant are just as aggressive and exciting as they were back then.<br /><br />Highly recommended and deservingly over rated !<br /><br />Love it !<br /><br />Also
B000K1PHRA|5.0|I just discovered Bill Bryson a few months ago, and I have loved every book that I've read, but this is by far the most hilarious one yet.  I was reading it while traveling in a car with my husband, and, after laughing out loud, would have to reread passages to him.  I haven't found it on audio book, but would love to hear it in Bill's voice, which adds to his sarcastic wit.
B00005JPFH|5.0|I don't understand why people think this movie was not as good as Spider-man 2?  In my opinion this movie was alot better for many reasons.  This movie had better action and alot more action, just as much romance, a better story, and a story that's much more compelling and thrilling! The special effects had to be the best I've ever seen especially Sandman.  It was alot of story and alot of stuff happening but isn't that what a third movie is supposed to be. Look at Matrix Revolutions, Lord of the Rings Return of the King, and Pirates - At Worlds End.  They all have huge stories and can be a bit confusing but I wouldn't have it any other way. Spider-man 3 was the best Spider-man movie ever!    PS. Spider-man 3 was better than Pirates - At Worlds End.    PS 2. I'm really positive there isn't going to be a Spider-man 4 and I know Tobey Maguire isn't doing a fourth movie, also Sam Raimi said he had no Idea's for a fourth movie!
B000002J27|5.0|Sometimes you have favorite albums, and other times you have \\"personal\\" favorite albums.  Albums that you like for personal reasons.      Genesis A Trick of the Tail is one of those extremely personal albums.  During the Peter Gabriel years (which were fantastic, by the way) they never really had an album that touched me on a certain unexplainable/spiritual level.      I don't know what it is, but something about the music Genesis was making in the year 1976 really made me grow attached to them.  The atmosphere of this album is extraordinary- so extraordinary it's hard to put into words.  It's like every song was written with the intention of allowing the listener to hold on to their childhood years.      That's why I hold the music of Genesis so close to my heart- these guys are simply able to touch me in a way that would probably make me look like some crazy whacko if they were to ever actually meet me in real life, haha.    From \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" all the way to \\"Los Endos\\", I get the feeling the band members recorded this music with a certain spiritual meaning that can't be found anywhere else, from any other artist.  Okay, maybe I'm exaggerating when I say ANY other artist- after all, Procol Harum, the Allman Brothers Band, King Crimson and several other bands exist.      This music is about remembering and cherishing how innocent and adventurous life was as a child, and about not EVER taking those special years for granted.  Just because we're adults doesn't mean we have to stop appreciating the way life is for us now- nooooo way!  An album like this seems to remind me how special being a child was.         Hey, I know what I say above sounds corny,  but when music sounds THIS good and THIS important, I get the feeling it was meant to be appreciated on a personal level.  If you were a child and had a certain extremely powerful belief in God, the music on this album will probably take you back to those special years of your life.    \\"Ripples\\" is such a greatsong.  I especially love the instrumental middle section.  It puts a strong picture in my head of what it's like to die, and then floating above the solar system and reaching heaven.  Something about the way the guitars are played in such a way where you can picture shooting stars surrounding you, and the piano tinkling really makes you think about a build up to something important- the most important event you will ever face.  Great, great music.    It's progressive rock played with a lot of meaning.  I strongly disagree with people who say rock and roll should always be short and sweet and to the point, because otherwise an album like this *never* would have been created.  It's spiritual atmosphere is something that will never grow old, no matter how bad the worlds gets, or how many things go wrong in our lives.  This album will always be here for us.    On another personal note, let me say before my mother died, she was a big Genesis fan.  I know why now.  This music reminds me of her, reminds me of heaven, and makes me think about life.  For that, it just doesn't get any better.
6305428220|4.0|I had forgotten about this movie and recently rewatched it.  It brought back so many memories! It is everything rolled into one without ever taking itself too seriously.  If your looking for a movie for pure entertainment this is the movie for you.
0593055063|4.0|I read this novel back in 2003 and found the plot plausible enough to be disturbing.  In many ways, I still like this novel better than some of Mr Brown's later novels.<br /><br />The story moves at a fast pace which to some extent masks some quite shallow character development.  Some elements of the story are uneven as well but that (to me) was all part of the thrill of it.  The pursuit of unbreakable encrytion algorithms and what this might really mean to the world in the hands on an unscrupulous individual was far more intriguing to me than the believability (or otherwise) of the characters involved.<br /><br />This novel was published in 1998 and is, I think, Dan Brown's first published novel.<br /><br />I recommend this novel as an action-filled page turner.  I'd probably rate it as 3.5 stars if Amazon provided such an option.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
B000002NZO|5.0|The classic sound of Genesis was almost in full swing as early as Trespass.  Peter Gabriel does a fantastic job with his singing ability throughout the album, along with the rest of the band.    Upon first hearing the album, I was surprised that the production is quite different from the future Genesis albums.  It doesn't sound as good.  It's muddy, but sort of tacky as well.  It doesn't sound pure or delightfully attractive, like on Foxtrot and Selling England by the Pound.  Still, it's good enough.    As far as songwriting goes, these are some really well-written songs.  Not *quite* as memorable as what would happen as early as Nursery Cryme, but really, just one step down in terms of quality.  I love the album anyway.    \\"Looking for Someone\\" has a really neat atmosphere that reminds me of walking through a forest, not to mention a spectacular build-up of piano work near the end.  \\"Visions of Angels\\" sounds like the Moody Blues which is always a good thing.    \\"The Knife\\" ROCKS like Genesis never really rocked before.  Seriously, it's a special song in the catalog of Genesis in that it's a lengthy jam that's mostly dominated with guitar soloing and a few fast-paced vocal lines from Peter Gabriel.  Quite unusual for Genesis to tackle something like that but they're really GOOD at it, that's the amazing part.      Fantastic album.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|I've been a fan of the White Stripes for five years, and I find at least with the full-length records that they can pretty much do no wrong. I tended to embrace both the earlier blues rock/garage sound and the art rock on [[ASIN:B00097A5H2 Get Behind Me Satan]], a range which showed how versatile the band is. They sound very electrified here and that is a good thing for me. As usual, the songs are all about as good as they could possibly be.    I've always thought Jack was effortless with the blues, and it's as present here almost as much as [[ASIN:B000068OSJ De Stijl]]. The title track is probably my single of the year, with the awesome pounding bass sound of Meg's spare beat and the insanity of the instrumental music. There is a diversity here and if you hoped for Meg to do some vocal work, it can be found here. \\"St. Andrew\\" is kind of the reprise of the finger-pick \\"Prickly Thorn, But Sweetly Worn,\\" but that's a track that's more spoken than sung. Both tracks go complete with bagpipes. -- unheard of on the previous five records! The latter mentioned track goes nicely for those who like something in the \\"Little Ghost\\" vein.    For me, other highlights are an amazing cover of \\"Conquest\\" which even has a siren/toy machine gun-esque bridge and I really like the chorus of \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You.\\" \\"Effect and Cause\\" shows that Jack White still has the lyricism in him. This is the sound of rejuvenation; it's like they really had a mojo workin' on this record. It's intense fun and just about anything you've liked about the group can be found here, with a few new added stuff that's also a nice change of pace. You may not enjoy it the first time around, but oh well oh well oh well (makes sense in the context of \\"Little Cream Soda\\").    While I thought the Raconteurs were a kind of average yet occasionally enjoyable pop group, that band probably makes this release all the more exciting. I'm glad these guys aren't defunct, and maybe won't be soon. Not too many guys hitthe mark each time like they do. And unlike most \\"return to form\\" albums, they remember what drew listeners in the first place.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|First, if you think Renee Zellweger can't be convincing as a turn-of-the-20th-century upper class London lady, you're wrong.  Don't feel bad; I was too, and happy to find it out.  That being out of the way---    \\"Love\\" is one of those words that has been worked to death by the greeting card companies, the pop music industry and just about every commercial enterprise you can think of.  If you want to remember exactly what it means, this movie offers a good strong display of many of its best facets.  To name only a few examples:    1.  Familial love:  Beatrix and her brother Bertram grew up sharing everything together from the nursery on.  Though Bertram's character disappers from the story while he is still a child, the adult Beatrix stauchly defends him in his absence, which comes to pass because he \\"married beneath his station\\" for--of all the screwy motives--love.  Beatrix loves her parents, and they love her, their inability to see eye-to eye on the subject of matrimony notwithstanding.  Her publisher/suitor Norman Warne seems very much at peace with his family, too.  Beatrix's father, Rupert, respects her enough to make his wife/her mother keenly aware that their daughter has done the family proud by becoming a famous published author and artist.  Heavens above--a movie without a single dysfunctional family!  Isn't that a miracle or something?    2.  Romantic love:  The development of the love between Beatrix and Norman Warne is wonderful--true mutual respect and admiration and support of one another as individuals evolves into something downright enviable by the standards of any age--and all without any nudity.  From now on, if I ever  hear the tune \\"Let Me Teach You How to Dance,\\" it will bring a tear to my eye.  And if I don't hear it ever again, that'll do the same thing.    4.  Love between friends:  The relationship between Beatrix and Warne's single 30-something sister, played admirably (as always) by Emily Watson, is female bonding at its best.  These 2are in a culture that thinks a woman must marry to have a future that consists of more than tea and crumpets.  It's a real treat to watch these two defy the norm and support each other in that bent and in so many other things.  Whether they are defying the culture around them or one is rescuing the other from the throes of debilitating grief, they are feminine strength at its best.    5.  Love for your fellow humans: Beatrix respects Mr. Heelis no less when they are children--and he is a farmhand's son while she is an aristocrat's daughter vacationing in the country--than she does when they are adults and he is a soliciter (that's a lawyer to us Yanks).  Her mother's references to \\"trades people\\" as if they were an inferior species are presented in a way that makes her attitude blatently absurd.  And there's that subtle, understated affection between the servants in the Potter household and the young Potters, expecially Beatrix, that defies description.    6. Self love:  That's meant in the positive sense, as in self respect.  Beatrix respects herself enough as an artist to persist at her craft and her efforts to bring it to the masses, despite just about everyone's discouraging her to do so--till Norman.  Speaking of whom, Norman Warne respects himself enough to insist that he be allowed to prove himself in the family publishing business--and then do it.  His sister respects herself enough to remain respectable while not compromising to convention at all.  (I love it when she wins the big money playing whist with the gentlemen at the Potters' Christmas party while the real \\"ladies\\" are in another parlour singing carols.)    7.  Love of the earth:  Though it hardly gets 10 minutes' exposure in the movie, do note that Beatrix Potter used the fortune she rightfully accumulated on her own to purchase 4000 acres of land in England's beautiful Lake District and preserve it in a trust for everyone to enjoy in perpetuity.  The clamor of residential real estate developers to buy up farm land and \\"put it to a good use\\" plunked this story right into the present moment.  I hope somebody besides me was taking heed.    Great performances, great scenery, great story, great directing, great photography.  Great snakes, what are you doing sitting here reading about this great movie?  SEE IT!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|You might have noted that some of the features are only available on the \\"SD release\\"?  And if you're not right up on things, which I certainly wasn't, you may be wondering, is this the \\"SD release\\" or not?  Thanks to my extensive research I am able to tell you that \\"SD\\" means \\"standard definition\\".  Which means not \\"HD-DVD\\" and not \\"Bluray\\".  So you do get these extra features.  Hope that helps.    I've never seen this but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  David Attenborough's name on something has been a certain indication of quality.  I'm buying it.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|King Crimson's \\"Red\\" is an album that does require a few plays to grow on you.  But it eventually scores a hit and captivates you.  My only possible quibble with the album is the somewhat meandering \\"Providence\\" and the instrumental break in \\"Starless\\" that, had I been in the editing room at the time, would have reduced it by a minute or three.    The highlight of the album for me is the layered guitar work on \\"Fallen Angel.\\"  The closing song \\"Starless\\" is fantastic (again, if they had only cut that plodding guitar riff in the middle of the song short).      If you are into progressive rock and enjoy music that is challenging, give this one a try.
1582701709|5.0|I about cried when I started reading this book since it was what I had been searching for.  I wasn't even halfway through chapter one before I realized this information had to be passed on to those around me.  I immediately ordered 10 copies to share with friends and family.      If you are feeling stuck, unhappy or unsatisfied...you need to read this book.  I began to apply what I read and immediately saw results.  It is amazing how empowered and hopeful you feel after implementing the ideas in this book.  I can't say enough...state your desires, believe it is so and receive it.  It's that simple.  This book will show you how.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|It is so nice to see a &#34;review?&#34; by an obvious Anti-God tick.  The movie is NOT about &#34;Sadistic Christ Killing Jews&#34; and a suicide bent Son of God.The reviewer has some real serious issues with his lack of faith and his knowledge of the Catholic faith and How we Catholics LOVE the Jews &#34;they are our brothers in God's plan&#34;If your going to question anything then question your own sanity.May God give you the graces that you need...The movie is a total experience of love through the gore and it brings to your very soul a touch of God's love for us and of course we don't question His ways..... We are not Gods!!God bless all and may your views be tempered by the deep love of The Perfect Lamb.
0385522401|3.0|It's hard to complain about an Ian McEwan novel. Geez, this guy can write! He's a wonder. But why must he write such short books? He seems to cut and run on his subjects.     My trouble with On Chesil Beach is that, although McEwan paints such a fine fine portrait of the couple's sexual anxieties, when we get to the next great intimate event--their first full-blown fight--he doesn't give as generous a portrait. Could he not have described what Florence is thinking as she walks away and abandons her husband on her wedding night? This is no small decision. And why does the book at the end belong to Edward's retrospect? What has Florence come to think of Edward and their aborted relationship after the many years? Why isn't the development of her own life and perspective relevant at the end, given how carefully he had portrayed her interior thoughts at the outset? Is this only Edward's story after all? I hadn't thought so. The conclusion he seems to offer us is that Florence knows herself better than Edward, that she will not change, and that there is less to know of her future experience than there is of his. She goes on to be exactly who she planned to be, and that goes for the intimate aspect of her as well. Perhaps that's a believable character, but McEwan hasn't convinced me that Florence is this fixed character.    I wish McEwan had taken us just a little bit further.
0898705525|5.0|The metaphor of the man setting sail from England only to be blown about at see and rediscover England - with all of the joy of discovering a new land, and all the comfort of returning home...simply brilliant.<br /><br />This book is packed with rich, witty, ballsy content that makes me proud and happy to be a follower of Christ.
0765348276|4.0|This book can be shortly described as \\"The Ultimate Starship Troopers\\", recalling the late routine of taking a vintage 60's comic-book and rewriting it in \\"the nineties style\\" or in the \\"21st century style\\"; think of The Ultimate Spiderman as opposed to the classic, or think of The Ultimates as opposed to the classic Avengers comic-book.    The book follows the basic plot of Starship Troopers (no spoilers, just the general feeling): 1st person narrator who is recalling in flashback how he joined the human space army to fight alien races, leaving earth, going through boot camp, fighting other species...    However, it is much lighter than Starship Troopers; not a single political issue, less hardcore scientific details, more suspension of disbelief required, a couple of big inconsistencies (in the wake of the typical Star Trek mistake of mixing teleportion with invasive surgery).    Maybe closer to Forever War than to Starship Troopers...  That withstanding, it is interesting, fast-paced, not blandly politically correct (as it seems to be standard today), and as enjoyable as both Forecer Peace and Starship Troopers.    4/5 Overall.  A fast, easy reading space opera. Enjoyable, and perfect for trips.

B00005JPHT|5.0|One may like or dislike Michael Moore, but the message of this film is as undeniable as the multiplication table. I am now 76 years old and lived the first half of my life in the U.S., the second half in England. I am very lucky in that, now that I need regular medical attention, I am here rather than there. At my age it's 100 percent free, including all medication--and it's very good indeed. I'm on a small pension, but I would not accept a fortune to return to my native country; if I did, it would soon be in the hands of the medical profession and I would not even be able to afford to return to where I would be cared for again. If this is \\"communism\\", I'll sing the Internationale.
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I liked the theatrical released of Daredevil, but it wasn't as gritty and violent as I thought it should be. The extras on the theatrical release are worth the purchase alone and now with the Director's Cut we get a much improved version of the film, plus a whole new bounty of extra material. It apears that the Blu Ray of the Director's Cut has carried over all the extras from the Director's Cut DVD(for once!), but I'm not positive about that. If so, keep the theatrical cut for the extra material and to revisit the theatrical release once and a while and buy the Blu Ray Director's Cut for the superior version and the new extra material. If you don't own any versions of this film and are thinking of buying this movie, buy the Director's Cut. This version really improves on the rushed feeling and sometimes hard to follow theatrical version.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|I am not extremely versed on the life and times of this great musician, so I do not know how critical I can really be when it comes to inaccuracies or not.  The strongest points aside from the story however, are the performances by Phoenix and Witherspoon.  These two young people deserve a round of applause for their hard work in doing the best they could to portray the characters they represent in this movie.  I enjoyed the story of Johnny's past including little details, like his family surviving a flood and of course the traumatic event of him losing his brother which changed his relationship with his father, which seemed somewhat frayed to begin with.  The set designers did a great job in really making you feel like you were back in that time period as well.  Overall a very enjoyable film that covers a lot of the roads that Cash walked.
0385512058|4.0|This book bangs the old drum about how successful networking is about giving, not getting. Most people who claim to network are looking for something from you... whereas master networkers focus on trying to immediately give you something you value. The value could be anything: a book, a website, a contact, or a job for their kid. Ferazzi has a long list of what value to give to people, and when, and how to go about it. I found the goal setting section alone worth the price of the book.<br /><br />For the most part, being friendly and helpful will come back to you tenfold. However, freely sharing your network with every spammer and slimeball who asks is a sure way of losing friends and contacts...<br /><br />Ferrazi sends mixed messages here... He shared several anecdotes from when he was just getting started about difficult people who refused to share their network. Clearly a big mistake, because Ferrazi is now a very useful person to know. Even if this wasn't the case, its vital to use the connections you have instead of hoarding them. If you cannot provide value to your network, your connections wither and die.<br /><br />However, later Ferrazi complains about people who call him out of the blue asking to network. His claim is that they have no value proposition. Fair enough, a good chunk of them probably are slimeballs who care about nothing but their own needs. If these kinds of people don't know or don't care to know how to add value to me, then maybe I shouldn't waste my time.<br /><br />Some of the folks without a value proposition may be connection vampires... on the other hand, they might be extremely valuable and just not good at understanding or communicating this fact. So how should we deal with these people? The big question that he doesn't fully answer, is how to be a lightweight gatekeeper? Yes, we should share our knowledge and network, but we also have the responsibility of protecting it.<br /><br />I'd like to see his take on this in a later article or book...
B000ICL3KG|3.0|Hmmmm, I almost fell for this back in 1975. You know...when it was called global COOLING!    The earth heats up and cools down folks. That's what it does. That's its thing. That's its bag, man. Peace.    I gave it three stars because I do find Al Gore entertaining. The fact that most (if not all) climatologists (the ones with PhD after their names) have discounted the single computer model (created by Michael Mann...not the director) on which Gore bases his entire argument, make the film that much more entertaining.    In twenty years, 'Rock and Roll McDonald's' will have sections devoted to the Y2K Virus and Global Warming. You wait and see.    Your grand kids will look at Al's picture and say, \\"Did people really believe this guy?\\"      Ok, I was trying to be diplomatic...cold hard fact is, all of them disagree with Al.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|The best and only real reason to buy this Beatles' CD is as souvenir for the best show currently on the Las Vegas Strip.<br /><br />Cirque du Soleil's Beatles tribute, \\"Love,\\" at The Mirage, is the best show in Las Vegas.  It is the only viable way to SEE a live performance of the Beatles' music now in the 21st Century.  The show is a spectacular, imaginative confection for the eyes and ears.  Big fun for teens, seniors, and all points in between.<br /><br />But what about this here \\"Love\\" CD.  Buy it as a souvenir if you've seen the show.  The Amazon price is much better than what you'll pay in The Mirage's Beatles-themed giftshop.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the show, though, is the CD worth getting?  Some of the Beatle-on-Beatle mash-ups put together by Giles Martin and his father George, are better than the originals.  The best example is \\"Octopus's Garden.\\"  The Abbey Road version is a cute novelty tune, but it's a throwaway.  In the live \\"Love\\" show, it's the highlight.  And not just because of the spectular Cirque choreography.  This version adds poignancy and depth.  On the other hand, there's \\"Something.\\"  It's one of the best vignettes in the live show.  On the disc, it's the same flat boring ballad.  You need the Cirque women, wearing white, floating at the four corners of the stage suspended by a near-invisible wire, to bring life to the line \\"something in the way she moves ...\\"<br /><br />One problem worth mentioning is that this CD was not made for mp3 players.  The tracks flow seamlessly one into the next.  It improves the listenability on the stereo or in the car, but it sounds \\"off\\" if played in random mode on an mp3 players.  The songs end abruptly as if the tracks were being used in the Sopranos' finale.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, if you haven't yet seen the show:  (1) get to Las Vegas and see the darn thing ASAP:  it's that good and (2) until you do, you'll wonder what the point is of this disc.  But if you've seen the \\"Love\\" show, you will understand the point.  When \\"Revolution\\" comes on, you'll be picturing in your head the manic choreography of that accompanied that song.<br /><br />One final point ... I might be a little slow here, but I just figured out why the show, and the CD, leads off with \\"Get Back.\\"  Because we're \\"getting back\\" in time, to the birth of the Beatles.  Sheesh.  I've seen the show twice and I'm only now getting it.ion\\" comes on, you'll be picturing in your head the manic choreography of that accompanied that song.    One final point ...

B000P0J024|5.0|It's rare that I'll review such a mainstream release, saving whatever advice I can offer for the more eclectic and off-the-main-drag artists I gravitate to. And this is not so much a review (of which there are plenty of well-detailed here) as it is a rave, a coyote gleeful howl of appreciation.    I got my copy of this boxed set earlier today. I watched the DVD first, then played the 2 CDs straight through a couple of times. What an evening! The Traveling Wilburys playing loud (remastered to pristine, crisp beauty in this new boxed set), with that jangly 12-string, acoustic-guitar-orchestra wall-of-sound and the delightful earnestness of a bunch of musical superstars leaving their egos at the door and having such obvious, genuine enjoyment making frivolous, fun, toss-away masterpieces, and maybe some of the most precious moments of 2 now dead (Roy Orbison and his best-in-rock voice shining so bright one last time, George Harrison having the time of his life and weaving his sweetly idiosyncratic slide guitar throughout), and who could have predicted what a great-sounding chorus the disparate voices of Bob, Tom, George, Roy, and Jeff would be?  All while reading Stephan Nachmanovitch's book \\"Free Play: Improvisation in Life and Art\\" and picking up \\"The Sound of Water: Haiku by Basho, Buson, Issa, and Other Poets\\" to randomly open it to any one the priceless poems so lovingly translated by Sam Hamill...    OMG, does it get any sweeter?!
B000Q3648S|5.0|The fifth album (more or less) by The Best Rock Band of the Last 25 Years should need no introduction, and indeed if you're interested in buying the deluxe edition of Sonic Youth's \\"Daydream Nation,\\" I can presume you're probably already a fan.  You already know how the album summed up and then changed the course of the underground rock movement of the 80s, how the ample attention of critics, then music fans, then record labels set the stage for the alternative rock revolution of the 90s--oh well whatever [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] and yada yada yada.  If, however, you haven't already drank the Kool-Aid (and you should!), some brief notes about the \\"basic\\" edition...<br /><br />\\"Daydream Nation\\" is still hailed as Sonic Youth's grand masterpiece, and yeah, it still holds up as such (confession: it's my second favorite SY album after [[ASIN:B000003TAJ Sister]]), even if it doesn't seem as radical today as it did when it came out.  Sure, there are swirling whirlwinds of oddly-(de)tuned guitars and feedback fading in, out and sometimes interrupting the songs, but make no mistake, there are definitely songs to be found here.  The openening \\"Teenage Riot\\" is, for its galloping drums and lyrical cheekiness (imagining Dinosaur Jr's J. Mascis as president, or so Thurston Moore has said) basically a melodic and even hummable pop song.  Even a more \\"experimental\\" song like \\"The Sprawl\\" has a certain immediacy, with bassist/vocalist Kim Gordon saying straigt out \\"does f**k you sound simple enough?\\"  Heck, the closing \\"trilogy\\" of the album has all the power and intensity familiar to any classic rock fans, only with a live-wire buzzing and skree that comes from playing in one of Glenn Branca's guitar-army ensembles.  Really, it's not so radical after all (for a taste of something far weirder, check out [[ASIN:B0000019PB Twin Infinitives]], which was released around the same time as DN by Royal Trux, a New York band friendly with Sonic Youth).<br /><br />For us fan(atic)s, the real treat here is the second disc of this set, which features live versions of all the album's tracks, culled from the band's original tour supporting the album, albeit in a different order (SY has recently announced it will play \\"Daydream Nation\\" as part of a special show, presumably in the album's running order).  These tracks, mostly of excellent sound quality, are shorter but sharper than the album versions.  \\"Total Trash\\" is done as an instrumental (I could be wrong, but they seem to be quoting the early Pink Floyd's instrumental \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" in one spot), preceded by another instrumental, \\"Totally Trashed,\\" which toys around with electronics a bit.  Mostly these are no-holds-barred performances that clearly draw on the band's love of hardcore punk and NYC No Wave (DNA, Teenage Jesus & the Jerks).  I don't know how a non-fan would react, but for yours truly it's pure Sonic bliss.<br /><br />Another great bonus on disc two is the inclusion of four cover songs, three of which were taken from now hard-to-find tribute albums (this was before that concept got beaten to death): \\"Within You Without You\\" (The Beatles), \\"Computer Age\\" (Neil Young) and \\"Electricity\\" (Captain Beefheart).  There's also a version of Mudhoney's \\"Touch Me I'm Sick,\\" with demented vocals from Kim, taken from a split 7\\" (as in vinyl, kids) that had the other band doing SY's \\"Halloween\\" on the reverse (alas, that version isn't included here).  The Beatles cover in particular shows how the band could translate their sound into completely different realms--the original, of course, was played mostly with sitars.<br /><br />Add all that to a package that includes ultra-Kool, and rare, pictures and an extensive essay by longtime SY friend Byron Coley, and you have a true Sonic feast.  Like they did with the [[ASIN:B000BR2P82 Goo Deluxe Edition]] and the [[ASIN:B000083LQB Dirty (Deluxe Edition)]], Sonic Youth rewards fans and newcomers alike almost to the bursting point.  Now let's hopethey burn down the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame before too long...Hall of Fame before too long...

B000O75F7C|3.0|Hay ocasiones en las cuales definir un estilo resulta contraproducente, porque entonces se atrofia la experimentación y se burocratiza la creatividad. Me parece que en alguna medida, eso le ha ocurrido al último  Porcupine Tree. Sin duda, los anteriores discos del grupo (\\"Stupid dream\\", \\"Lightbulb sun\\", \\"In absentia\\" y \\"Deadwing\\") habían configurado un estilo grandioso, basado en la composición rigurosa, la ejecución impecable... y numerosas, agradables, brillantes sorpresas detrás de cada track. Por desgracia, ahora que el grupo ha encontrado por fin el acceso a una popularidad (casi) masiva, la consolidación de su prestigio ha ocasionado una merma en su música. ¿Casualidad o destino? No lo sé, pero intentaré explicarlo.  Por muchos motivos, \\"Fear of a blank planet\\" es un disco valioso, con un concepto inteligente: muy relevante me parece la crítica que emprenden contra el tedium vitae de los jóvenes y niños primermundistas. Quizás para subrayar la violencia que se propone representar, la música es dura: estamos ante el disco más metalero, más potente del grupo, con momentos de verdad deslumbrantes (sobre todo la parte central de \\"Anesthetize\\" y el gran final de \\"Sleep together\\"). Para ello, se ha endurecido el sonido de las guitarras y la batería... en demérito del trabajo bajístico y tecladístico del grupo. ¿Dónde están las memorables líneas de bajo que caracterizaban el sonido del grupo en canciones como \\"Hatesong\\" o \\"A slave called shiver\\"? ¿Dónde quedaron las espléndidas atmósferas electrónicas de \\".3\\" o de \\"Start of something beautiful\\"?  Por otra parte, el uso y abuso de la influencia deathmetal ha cohibido la imaginación compositiva y la creatividad arreglística del grupo. En otros discos, a la vuelta de cada compás nos podía aguardar un sax, una sección de cuerdas, un oboe sintetizado, una flauta, un ritmo sincopado, un coro de voces polifónicas o un loop technotrance. En este disco, se acabaron esas sorpresas, y las tensiones de las melodías siempre se resuelven con la irrupción, cada vez más previsible, de guitarras heavydeathmetaleras.  A pesar de todos estos detalles, el disco rockea, y rockea duro: desde que lo compré, lo he escuchado una y otra vez. Aunque se trate de un disco de transición, no tan logrado como los anteriores, \\"Fear of a blank planet\\" es una obra sólida y disfrutable, para escuchar con el volumen altísimo y la mente abierta. Ojalá estemos ante el augurio de una nueva obra maestra.
0767802659|2.0|Robert Heinlein's 1959 Hugo Award winning novel Starship Troopers is the inspiration for this very loose movie adaptation.  Heinlein was a 1928 graduate of the Naval Academy and the author of over thirty science fiction novels.  Starship Troopers encouraged the growth of the military science fiction subgenre.<br /><br />Literature is a springboard for ideas, insights and intellectual growth, but science fiction rarely aspires or reaches such heights.  When I first read the novel as a teenager it provided insights into how a society might be organized and in the years since it has been a springboard for new ideas and growth.  I'm not saying the novel is great literature, but it is superior science fiction.  It presents a plausible future society with an appropriate intellectual and philosophical framework.  It is the philosophical aspect that is at the heart of the novel.  This movie rips that heart out of the story.<br /><br />Written during the height of the Cold War, the novel was the means by which Heinlein argued for a strong military.  The story also serves as a vehicle to present his libertarian political ideas.  While the story does contains more introspection, exposition, and character discussion than is common in the genre it has also been criticized as exceedingly pro-military and lacking in character depth and development.  The story is pro-military, but I do not agree that it lacks character development.  However, one must remember that, unlike most science fiction, Heinlein was presenting ideas with the novel, not merely a story about killing alien bugs.<br /><br />If the movie stood alone I might be able to recommend it based on some fine special effects, truly unworldly aliens and great action scenes, but since I read and enjoyed the novel I could not enjoy this travesty of a movie.<br /><br />Recommendation: Read the novel, [[ASIN:0441783589 Starship Troopers]], skip the movie.<br /><br />Kyle Pratt
B000EWBKKI|3.0|I love this movie, it is one of my all time favorites. I recently upgraded to a Blu-Ray player and this is one of the first movies I bought. I am hugely disappointed in the quality and features of this BD. It honestly sux. I went from the Ultimate edition to this BD edition and took a huge step back. The quality is about the same as the Ultimate or Extreme editions and there are no bonus features. This was one of the big movies I bought a Blu-ray player for, so you can understand my disappointment. I will probably sell it and re-buy the Ultimate or Extreme edition. I recommend waiting to see if they come out with an Ultimate or Extreme edition on Blu-ray before buying this one.
B00003CXAA|5.0|My wife and I will sometimes watch all the movies in this set right in a row! I love the bonus materials dvd that comes with. It has additional scenes, a locations featurette, a Corleone family tree, a making of documentary, and all kinds of interviews with most of the actors. Don't hesitate to buy! It's worth it at allmost any price!
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Phenomenal film that well-deserves all of the positive press I had heard about it. A story of stupendous coincidence as a Danish man running an orphanage in India returns to Copenhagen for the business end of a large donation. This movie so simply could have been a narrow and uncomplicated story but each moment peels another and yet another unexpected layer. The acting was absolutely marvelous as relatively pigeon-holed characters begin to blossom into more dynamic people. Sensational movie but the white subtitles are a real strain.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is one of the best works of pure music I have bought in awhile.  Not very often do you buy something where the artist really tried to make a statement with the music, but here, they do.  For KWS and company to just go out, find the ROOTS of the music we listen to today, and make music on the spot with them is just amazing.  Too bad they didnt bring more film to document even more than they already did. I could watch that footage for days. Everything here is beyond top notch.  Very insightful, provides a glimpse of where the music came from and where it is going.  If your a fan of ANY kind of blues, southern, or just guitar led music...you will love this.
0143036742|4.0|I don't usually read novels but the title of this book (together with a drawing of an Ukranian tractor on the cover) was too much for me to pass by.<br /><br />It tells the story of first and second generation Ukrainian exiles in British town - an elderly, lonely widowed father whose heart is still very much in the \\"old country\\" and his two feuding daughters. The book has much humour and amusing insights into the seam between British middle-class provincial society and the world of refugees in the New Europe. Nikolai (the father) falls in love (or so he thinks) with a busty Ukranian , Valentina, who seeks a better life in the UK for herself and her son Stanislav.  Nadezhada, one of the daughters (in whose first person the book is written) is appalled , detests the potential stepmother and only finds sympathy for her after the marriage breaks down. An entertaining read.
0767818040|5.0|While filming \\"Dressed To Kill\\" in 1979, Brian DePalma was first inspired to make this film. The notorious shower scene with Angie Dickinson (in full ala-nude), a 'body double' was brought in to stand in whenever it was showing Angie Dickcinson from the neck down, nude. Great way to immediately throw you off balance as a viewer, symbolizing right away, don't trust what you are watching, for like a magician, at some point in this story he's gonna surprise you by making you believe you saw one thing but not another, while showing the viewer what they are seeing the entire time right before your very eyes! Vavoom!<br /><br />Of coarse this has rings and tones of \\"Rear Window\\" and \\"Vertigo\\" all through it (as well as a few other great Hitchcock thrillers, like \\"Shadow of A Doubt\\", \\"Dial M for Murder\\", \\"Rope\\", and \\"Marnie\\", which the latter featured Melanie Griffith's mom, Tippi Hedren), what better films to pay homage to???! It also has flourishes of the French, Italian, and European filmmakers that have inspired DePalma throughout as well. It has the perfect combination a psychological erotic thriller is supposed to have, all the right ingredients, from erotic fervor to dark sinister terror, from insane biting satire to leaving you breathless in despair. It's a Brian DePalma Showing...An event cause de celebrete....A classic work of film art.<br /><br />Anyways, he shelved the idea, working and writing on it between his next two classics, \\"Blow Out\\" (1981) and \\"Scarface\\" (1983).<br /><br />So, in 1984, Brian DePalma returned to the genre that only he does best: The erotic/psychological/suspense/mystery/thriller/satire. He fleshed out (no pun intended) a story only he could tell (he was initially just gonna produce it...thank God he decided to direct it as well!!), and made it as fresh as a golden sunrise.<br /><br />He throws the viewer off guard right away by starting the film making viewers believe they are about to see a good late night B-grade vampire flick, then immediately shows that it's only a movie starring the main character of DePalma's film. Then, as the title of the film comes on screen, with an awesome desert background that is suddenly pulled away, revealing that it (the background) is just a matte painting for some movie backdrop. Right away, like The Magician, DePalma is revealing to not trust what you are about to see for the next two hours, even though it will be done right before your very eyes. The tagline was perfect for this film: \\"Don't believe everything you see\\".<br /><br />Jake Scully, our main character (played to perfection by Craig Wasson) is a claustrobic, soon-to-be-out-of-work actor, who goes home after a bad day's shoot just to find his girfriend in bed with someone else! And, if wonders never cease, the apartment is hers, so he goes packing.<br /><br />From staying with a friend, a local bartender, then moving through treacherous auditions (when he already \\"is working now, and that's what matters, isn't it?\\"), to have the skies depart when he befriends a chap between acting auditions and acting class, which plays out like Acting 101, with a 'psychiatric' acting teacher whose methods just may or may not be helpful or harmful, which one???! A very crucial scene there where Jake is told \\"You must act!\\", DePalma's way or reminding his audience that they must 'live', not just be a couch potato watching Life go by, participate, act! And, then things get even better for Jake (this is his lucky day, let me tell you, LOL!), his new friend (played by the great Gregg Henry) is called away for an acting gig out of town, so he needs Jake to housesit the house he's subletting. Using a real house in L.A., it is beautifully built, shaped like a spaceship, and very high in the air, with windows all around it, brilliantly filmed. AWESOME!<br /><br />Then Jake is told and shown that his next door neighbor likes to do an erotic dance every night in front of her window, in full view of Jake and the handy telescope that is set in that sole position, aimed right at her house. And, Jake, being a person of very low self esteem, and just feeling he's back in the 'world', even though it's not a world to brag about. He IS living in L.A's dirty underbelly, getting only bit parts in lowrate, B-grade (possibly direct to video?) obscure films, but he lets his esteem and obsession for a better life get in the way, seeking solace by watching the lady next door do a very sexy striptease for two nights in a row, and even while she's sleeping (he knows when you're awake, ha-ha) he still likes to peep in on her, thus noticing at some point that someone else is also watching her.<br /><br />So, in a fanatic/obsessive/compulsive way, he starts to follow Gloria Revelle (played by the beautiful/talented Deborah Shelton), the lady that lives in the house across from his. It is here that DePalma really shines with his technique of 'pure cinema', 'visual storytelling', making use of extremely long takes, and long scenes, with no dialgue, lasting for over 20 minutes.<br /><br />There then is a seduction more wonderous than the clouds outside. Yes, there is such a thing as love at first sight! Gloria and Jake are similar in several ways. Both are claustrophobic, but in completely seperate terms of the word. Both live in a world of fear, dread, depression, despair, loneliness, in a seedy world of decadence, the beautifully filmed L.A. A very sinister, corrupt city if there ever was one, especially in the movie business, and/or the life of 'The Idle Rich'.<br /><br />Jake then is plunged in to a world of hapless terror while he witnesses a murder, but is 'paralized', and can't 'act' to save the victim. He tries, lord knows he tries!<br /><br />A brief appearance by the great Guy Pierson as a very 'noirish', been-there-seen-that-world-weary-wise-guy detective, who really drills (again, no pun intended) Scully like the victim got drilled to death.<br /><br />Cut to Jake in a spinning bed, watching late night porno ads, and a very particular one catches his eye, \\"Holly Does Hollywood\\". He calls, gets an audition for the next \\"Holly\\" flick, reads for the director, gets the job.?.?. What is Jake so suddenly obsessed with now? WHO is Jake suddenly obsessed with now? Porno actress Holly Body (played by Melanie Griffith in her BEST role EVER), a naive (?), blue-eyed, bleach blonde, brain dead bimbo (?); or is she a very intelligent, extremely beautiful, rough and tough (?) femme fatale that Jake shouldn't be getting involved with???!<br /><br />One of Craig's best scenes as Jake are during this period, especially in the porn flick, when he walks into the bathroom, saying \\"Ok\\" with such a stilted slur, JUST like real porno...VERY BAD dialogue! Or, dialogue done VERY BADLY!<br /><br />Frankie Goes To Hollywood deliver a tour-de-force performance in this crucial point of the film (as great as The Yardbirds in Antonioni's \\"Blow Up\\"!) remaining as fresh today as it did then.<br /><br />Eventually the mystery is solved, super dog kills the bad man, and we have The End! But, not so easy as all that. This is a very deep, disurbing, hypnotic, visceral, cerebral look inside the Human mind, and the wicked world of Hollywood. The sleazy-ness of it all. And, the blood and gore behind the scenes. And, Jake must learn to (literally) 'act'.<br /><br />The way DePalma catches 'claustrobia' visually is utterly breathtaking, and SO realistic. The journey into Jake's mind is a cinema sweep of pure genius! And, all over a body double.<br /><br />Be sure to watch for the scene that is a running parody of bad porno film trailers, and the 'glowing' reviews from critics! Hilarious & brilliant!<br /><br />This is a film that will play you like a fool, but treat like its best friend at the same time. DePalma, of coarse, had to take on the MPAA in defense of the rating of this film. Plus, he originally wanted to cast a real life porno actress as Holly Body, but the studios shot him down on that one,but in his favor really, because this was the role Melanie Griffith was born to play! He first fought them over ratings in 80 over \\"Dressed To Kill\\", then in 83 over \\"Scarface\\", winning all three times. This is also the film which helped concrete him as 'mysoginistic', something he got labeled by extremest women's groups when he made \\"Dressed To Kill\\" (something that baffles me even to this day, because here were all these sleasy lowrate B-grade horror films that DePalma was mocking with the book-ends of this film, nude females running around like brain dead bimbo's, but everybody loved those, but DePalma films a woman nude with style and class, or a woman murdered -count ONE woman- and he gets attacked for being too violent toward women in his films.?.?.?.) Do what????!<br /><br />This is a very classy, stylish, almost noirish, psychological, sinister look into the whole seedy Hollywood world, warts and all, from the glitz to the 'sl*ts'. And, he did it with guts! True masterpiece from the Master of Horror that remains as timeless as when it was released. Thank you.his eye, \\"Holly Does Hollywood\\".

B00008WT5E|5.0|All of these remastered reissues are GREAT! I walked into Best Buy and bought all at once (well, except for Let There Be Rock which I needed to special order) and that $70 happily flew out of my hands. The books that come with each CD are well worth the money themselves. Unlike some booklets like these, they aren't padded with \\"I love this band\\", \\"this album is great\\" and \\"this and every other song is amazing historic and will change your life.\\"<br /><br />Some background about the album, the time period in the band's history, and other behind the scenes info make up most of it including information about the tours and other trivia. Good, meaty stuff.<br /><br />Powerage in particular is a delight. A far too often overlooked album that many don't even know exists is more consistent that some of of the more popular albums. It has a slightly different sound than the other albums - almost progressive! You won't find radio-friendly hits but this album pulls you in and never lets you go.
6305882592|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS HEART MOVING, AND TEACHES A VALUBLE LESSON ABOUT HUMANITY AND THE WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE!

EVERYONE COULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS INCREDIBLE HEART MOVING CLASSIC!
B00008WT5C|4.0|Not a bad album but, for my taste, the weakest album from front man Bon Scott. I think that, with the exception of the amazing title track, it is a mediocre album. Again - I would buy it, but I'd buy this one last after all the others. That's for the music, but I'd still buy it for the booklet and to have a complete Bon Scott collection.<br /><br />All of these remastered reissues are GREAT! I walked into Best Buy and bought all at once (well, except for Let There Be Rock which I needed to special order) and that $70 happily flew out of my hands. The books that come with each CD are well worth the money themselves.

B000002AVF|4.0|From the first time my ears heard her voice...i was in love with this talented diva like, American Musical Treasure. This is truly one of if not the best Mariah Carey Albums of all. I am a  firm believer in the notion that some songs or artists should NOT be re-recorded...however Mariah does an excellant job of owning, even if only for this album, \\"Open Arms\\"...of course the original being from Steve Perry and Journey. There's Something about Mariah and the lyrics \\"Lying Beside Me\\"...\\"one Sweet Day\\" is a tear jerker for anyone who has ever had to say good~bye to a loved one...great song. \\"Always be My Baby\\" is a cute song for the lover in you...\\"Fantasy\\" is for the dancefloor with it's sample of \\"Genius Of Love\\" from the Tom Tom Club. Another personal fav' is \\"Melt Away\\". This is a beautiful woman \\"working it\\" with a voice that is another reason to believe in GOD because this voice could have only come from Heaven.
B000002UVZ|4.0|This is good stuff.  I was never a huge REM fan but I did like them because back in the day there were pretty cool.  They had a cool stripped down sound that was unconventional at the time.  What that means is they did not exactly rock my socks off but they were playing actual guitars, drums and basses instead of a synthesizer and drum machine.  In my mind that was enough to make them pretty cool.  My sister had Reckoning (also pretty cool) and Fables of the Reconstruction (which sucked) so when Lifes Rich Pageant came out I was pretty familiar with REM and kind of liked some of their stuff but felt funny about it because they were my sisters band.  The video for Fall on Me is what sold me on the record and I am glad it did because this (as I have said) is good stuff.  Buck's guitar had some snarl to it and the drums are heavy and driving - much more so than before or since.  As I have admitted, I am not a huge REM fan but have never stopped liking this album.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I am so glad I bought this CD with JAMIROQUAI's best hits (and plus some \\"extra\\" bonus songs are included).<br /><br />If you like the sound of a sort of combo \\"jazz-rock\\" Cd then this is the one for you.  JAMIROQUAI is a great band. It`s hard to truly define their sound, but whatever it is ,... it's GREAT!<br /><br />As I said before, this band is a combo jazz-rock with a bit of alternative thrown in. The lead singer is AMAZING! The other band players are absolutely amazing too.<br /><br />If you get this Cd, you wont be able to stop your feet from twitching to their beat. FUN!!!!!!<br /><br />PS: if you have seen NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE then you will recognize track # 11!!---LOVE IT, and so will you!
B000NHG7BQ|5.0|The passion between Costner and Stowe in this movie is too real.You feel for Costner's great love for this women in the sad ending to this great, highly underrated film. Give this film a look, you won't forget it.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Bon jovi has created a truely great album with Lost Highway. Whether or not you love or hate the idea of a Nashville Bon Jovi record, there is more to say here than recent records. Bon jovi has created a unique album for themselves while maintaining the Bon Jovi sound. They pushed the envelope and created the best album they have since These Days. Doing something different with an empty canvas, this is what making music is all about. I love it!
B000MV9026|2.0|First of all, I bought this movie when it came out on dvd since I didn't have the time to see it in the theater. Now I wish I had because I could have saved myself a few dollars. I'm an animation student and what I saw disappointed me in more than one way. Okay, the message was WAY too obvious and disjointed. \\"We'll save the penguins because, hey, they can tap dance.\\" Would any action have been done at all, if the penguins COULDN'T tap dance? Like I said, inconsistent. As for the character design, good for realistic quality. The biggest disgrace there was the four amigos. Now, I love Robin Williams, but the character designers did NOT give his character anywhere close to the kind of character he should have had. The four amigos looked like they had white felt circles glued on their faces. The main reason this movie got the Best Animated Feature award was because of the environmental message, not for story and not for quality. Also, most likely because Steve Irwin had a part. That I can TOTALLY understand because I have GREAT respect for him as I'm sure a lot of us do. This isn't a bash of the movie, I'm just stating my viewpoint as an animation fan and student. I hope this doesn't offend anyone but as I said, it's just my opinion.
1400063515|2.0|I read Taleb's previous book with great pleasure and interest, and looked forward to this one.<br /><br />Unfortunately this one is a jumble, with important ideas wrapped in piles of repetitious ego-driven extraneous stuff.  He makes the same points over and over again, without clarifying them after the first presentation or two.<br /><br />Taleb boasts in the acknowledgments about how he got his editor to spare him the attentions of copy editors, whom he claims ruin the exquisite rhythms of his prose and make too many irrelevant corrections.  Too bad, as they would have spared him many obvious errors in usage and grammar as well.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one.  Read the previous one.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|The album alone is incredible.  The story of the movie is as real and as touching as any film I have seen.  Both stand alone as a major accomplishment. But put them together and the result is breathtaking.  Too bad so many will miss this wonderful experience because it is not a \\"commercial\\" film.  Sometimes art just is.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|As usual, the Queens turn another corner while keeping that same hard to define thread that's run through all of their albums to date.  This is probably their least commercial release since their first and definitely sounds like a record they just did because they wanted to do it. Production is more raw, and the songs more experimental, in some ways like the early days... but in some ways much more advanced than anything to date.     It's a great record. I can't say it's my favorite of theirs, yet. But, it was worth the wait... and continues to solidify them as one of the few rock bands doing anything worthwhile right now.
0385495323|5.0|Wow, wow, wow. I have never read a book faster than this one. I couldn't put it down!  <br />  <br />I don't want to spoil any of the incredible stories found within, so I'll just describe the book's two main strengths.  <br />  <br />Firstly, the explanations of increasingly complex cyphers, all the way down to quantum cryptography, were insanely good. As an example, the workings of Enigma, the sophisticated encryption machine used by the Nazis, became transparent after reading this book.  <br />  <br />Equally important, the encryption methods described in the book are masterfully tied in with their historical context, much of which is not widely known because much of the material was classified for a very long time. I think you will be amazed by how much of history was decided by the strength and weaknesses of various cyphers. I was.  <br />  <br />In short, go read this book. It is extremely entertaining and (bonus!) extremely informative.
B000MZHW40|5.0|The Blood Diamond has double meaning.  An extremely bloody war is being funded by diamonds, and the stars of the movie are after a huge stone that has a red tint to it.  Leonardo Dicaprio is after the diamond and Djimon Hounsou (named Solomon in the movie) agrees to show him where it is, but only goes along with Dicaprio so that he can find his son.  Solomon's son has been been taken and made into a 10 year old rebel soldier.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist and does a great job of using her charm to help forget about the war that is going on, even if it is just for a moment.  The best parts are the action scenes.  Solomon will do whatever he has to to get his son back, and likewise for Dicaprio with the diamond.  It all leads to a very exciting ending.<br /><br />There is great drama, a great story, and marvelous acting from everybody, but the action sequences stood out the most to me.  The rebels seem to enjoy killing everyone and anyone.  When they show up, expect to see some intense shoutouts.  The 2 fight scenes are also good, mainly because Djimon Hounsou is such a superb actor.  I wouldn't have minded seeing more of his rage.  Dicaprio also gives an extraordinary performance.  He may be better in this than he was in 'The Aviator'.<br /><br />This is the best movie I have seen in at least a couple months, and I am a hardcore movie junkie.  I don't like giving away too much in my reviews, in fact I always try to give away as little as possible.  My rating sums up how I feel the best.  This movie gets a perfect 5/5 from me.  It is relentless, and I couldn't look away for a second.  I can't believe I waited so long to finally watch this.
B00004TJAL|4.0|Very good blues album, filled with just good tracks.  If you like blues,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Two great bluesman and great guitar players. Go buy it !
B000PKG6TE|4.0|This is QOTSA's best disc since their first album and a huge improvement over Lullabies To Paralyze.  Josh brings it on heavy and keeps me listening to the layers in every song.  Stand-out tracks: Sick Sick Sick, Suture Up Your Future, and 3's and 7's.  Songs I could do without: The repetitive and hectic \\"Battery Acid,\\" and the also repetitive, slightly exhausting \\"River In The Road.\\"
B000002UV9|4.0|Very good rock album, played by great musicians and with the incredible voice of Goeff Tate.  Great sound and highly recommanded for any rock music fan. No filler, just good tracks on this one.  Their second best album, my first choice goes to \\"Operation Mindcryme\\"
B000RJO578|5.0|There are some who have seen this film and said that it was full of gore, it was repetitive, and much too full of 'that hollywood stuff'. For those who feel this way--I'm afraid you've missed the point.    The point of this film is simply to, in a comedic way, blend the mundane story of an English Policeman, with the over-the-top 'explosions and guts' style of Hollywood; Hence the flower gardens and decapitation.    This isn't a Hugh Grant film- this is an Edgar Wright handmade, Bad Boys II meets Evil Dead II remix, wrapped around the genius of heterosexual life partners, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.    It has explosions. It has guts. It has insanely long gun fights. And you know what? It also has one hell of a script; Borrowing from almost every cop movie ever made, it also manages to incorporate the unique quips and inside jokes belonging to Pegg and Wright.    By the power of Grayskull!        POSSIBLE SPOILER BELOW    Jokes range from a simple, yet effective 'Yarp', to a lengthy and surprising scene starring one Mr. David Bradley (Mr. Filch to you Potter fans) and one olympic mine.    Excellent comedy, suspensful horrorshow, and one hell of a show.    I recommend to all.
0440241901|5.0|I absolutely loved this book; I loved how she captured every detailed thought in the character's mind.  I would highly recommend this read for someone who needs a good cheer-me-up book.  It's funny and romantic.
0375831002|5.0|I rarely ever pick up a book relating to WWII, it's a touchy subject...but I could not put this book down. It was absolutely amazing, especially because it was narrated by Death, which made it all the more interesting. Excellent book.
B000683VI4|5.0|I'm glad I finally got to buy this movie, it is one of my favorites. If you want to know what love could do to somebody and how powerful can be just watch this movie and you'll see what love is all about...<br /><br />Just to let you know make sure you have a box of tissue handy, or maybe two haha!
B000P2A24W|5.0|This CD is the best they've made since These Days in 1995.  The songs are simple, but terrific.  As always, the lyrics are great, the band tighter than ever.  \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore,\\" \\"Seat Next to You\\" and \\"I Love This Town\\" are my favorites so far.  As for the band going country, totally untrue.  Yes, there are some hints of country in some of the songs, but it's subtle.  Bon Jovi has displayed bits of country in a number of songs over the years, and this just continues that trend.  Less piano, more steel guitar, but still Bon Jovi!    I've been listening to Bon Jovi for 20 years now and this is an exciting new CD.  Have a Nice Day has some strong moments, but this is a stronger effort. Don't let the hype dissuade you from trying this.  Great effort from one of the all-time greatest bands.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|i discovered paramore last year when i saw the pressure video on fuse. i was immediatly blown away by how how young and talented they were. once i discovered that they were very close to my age i was even more amazed. soon after, i finally got their debute album all we know is falling and fell in love with it, they quickly became one of my favorite bands. now with the release of riot!, the band is even more so a favorite of mine. the opening track, \\"for a pessimest, i'm pretty optimistic\\" is a fantastic opener that i can't get out of my head. every song can be a hit. while many, may feel that this record sounds the same as many records out today, it doesn't feel that way. while many bands out there today lack meaning and heart in the music and lyrics, paramore gives you all of that and more. with the departure of their second guitarist, hunter lamb, the band sounds great as a four person band, and taylor york fills hunters shoes very nicely for the live show. i can only expect to hear more amazing songs from paramore in the future.
0151013047|4.0|The story of the Reluctant Fundamentalist is a monologue by Changez, a Pakistani-born graduate from Princeton, to a visitor in his native town of Lahore.    The book is about Changez's change/realization, which transforms him from an American financial analyst from Princeton to an individual reintroduced to his cultural identity and family.  The book begins when Changez accepts a job at a valuation firm and begins a relationship with an American girl named Erica.  During the story, 9-11 occurs and the Indian-Pakistani conflict arises.  Changez sees America's global role as one of self-interest and he feels as though he is leaving behind his natural culture and identity.    The Reluctant Fundamentalism does not delve into religious fundamentalism much at all, nor does it go into any detail about criticism of the United State's foreign policy.  It focuses around Changez inner struggle, his relationship with Erica, his relationship with his work, and his continuing desire for resolution in his sense of identity.    Overall, an enjoyable, easy, and relatively quick read.
B00005R24G|5.0|It's hard to believe this one's actually out of print... The entire film (a masterful stage play) is both a delightful mystery with a truly unexpected ending and, quite literally, a lesson in acting excellence.  It's not often that two leading men in the same film both get nominated for Best Actor, and given the fact that the two leading men are Sir Michael Caine and Sir Laurence Olivier, you know you're in for a treat!  If you get your hands on this, grab it with both hands!  It may look a bit faded (ah, the 70s!) but it's well worth watching!
0753820250|5.0|I enjoyed this book more than any I have ever read.  The story is magnificent--coming of age, adventure, mystery, love, friendship, family relationship, so many wonderful components.  I could hardly bear to put the book down and I crave more now that I am finished.  I would love to see Carlos Ruiz Zafon and Lucia Graves put out more books in English!
B000002MUQ|5.0|This is another great album by one of the greatest bands to hit the hard rock scene, Van Halen. Eddie's guitar sounds amazing as do Alex's drums.  1: The Seventh Seal: Awesome riff by eddie and a fun song to listen to.  2: Cant Stop Lovin You: A nice bass line in the background and a great love song.  3: Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do): Argueably one of the greatest riffs I have heard, you can hear the mean, growl of Eddie's Guitar along with a classic EVH solo. A heavy song that is one of the best on the album.  4: Amstersdam: A fun song with a great tone of Eddie's Guitar and an awesome solo. Another great song.  5; Big Fat Money: Another fun song with really good solo work and just makes you wanna jump up and dance the ngith away ;)  6: Eddie Van Halen gettign creative with forks on a piano and inside it, should be used in a horror secene of a movie, it's creepy.  7: Not Enough; A sweet and easy-going song with nice piano work.  8 Aftershock: One of the best on the album, A great riff and a really good song with classic EVH soloing.  9: Alex's Van Halen mastery over the drums.  10: Balichutherium: An excellent instrumental song with deadly EVH guitar tone. Probably the best tone I've ever heard from a guitar. At the end, u can hear what EVH can do with a guitar and the different noises that he can make with a guitar.  11: A good song that always amke me think of the old days for me.  12: Feelin' :A slower song but really good with one of the fastest solos I've heard since eruption. Just shows you EVH's mastery over the guitar.    Overall, I'd rate this album 9/10. It's a great album and never gets old to me. If you are a VH fan, it's a must own. Even if you are just a hard-rock fan, you should own this.

B000OVLBF8|2.0|Ok, I have to admit that I am a sucker for comic book adaptation, and have probably seen all of them. Why is this one so bad? Everything! Bad CGI, poor actor direction (not acting) and the story is SOOO predictible....    My suggestion for the producers: recut, revamp some scenes to make them more appropriate for childrens, and re-release the movie with a G rating: kids will love it!
B000EULJLU|5.0|This was the first Tool album i bought.  I'd been exposed to them well before back in 97 but i could never quite swallow the sound.  Tool is renowned for being thoughtful, difficult music, and i never had the patience before to really analyze what was going on in the music, as many of their songs while masterful, were very hard and alot more obscure than the music i was listening to at the time.  I actually thought the slower songs on this album were what got me on this album more than anything else really.  Vicarious hooks you immediately and leads into the the thunderous 'Jambi' but it was with songs like 10,000 days and Right in Two that i could really just sit back and enjoy Tool's methodic sound, which is apparent in all their songs but not usually so relaxing and melodic.  I can say though, that after seeing these guys in concert, these slower songs i would say are among the most engaging tracks these guys have cut.  Their technical ability is unrivaled by any group i have ever heard, and the absolute control they have together as a collective mind over EVERY aspect of their sound shows how intentional even the slightest sound you hear in their music is.  This is evident in watching the bizarre videos they play at their shows and how syncronized alot of things are between the video and the music.  Tool is easily one of the greatest bands to grace this era, and this album catches them more refined than ever.  Commanding and Majestic.  A must hear....   multiple times.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|Many people had mixed feelings about this film when they heard that Ashton Kutcher was to play the lead role.  Could he manage to pull of such a dramatic role, profoundly different from his normally comedic role on \\"That 70's Show?\\"  The answer...yes, without question!    The plot of this movie centers around the subject of time travel and what altering the past can do to the future.  However, unlike many other films that deal with the same topic, this keeps an aura of dark reality about it.  Not only does it deal with changing future events, it also delves into a deeper meaning than that.    Aside from the obvious premise, this film also shows that your life is your life and you are dealt the cards you are dealt.  There is no need to change past events because no matter what you change, there will always be elements of your life you will not be happy with.  Also, not to give anything away but unlike many Hollywood movies, this one doesn't necessarily have a happy ending which in my mind is a good thing and perfectly justifies the movie as a whole.    I must say I also felt a lot of good chemistry between Kutcher and Amy Smart.  To me, Ashton has proven himself a worthy actor in not only the comedic genre, but also the dramatic roles.  Amy Smart seems very natural in this role and doesn't seem to force anything.    Overall this movie is well worth owning and truly shows the potential Ashton has in becoming a serious actor.  I have not and don't intend to see the sequel.  This is the only \\"Effect\\" you'll need to see.
B000002HNS|5.0|There isn't really much I can honestly add to the comments here and the many reviews that exist of this album. What I can say though is that it is a true testimony of the quality and depth of the Doors' music on many levels, even the most unimaginable.  <br />  <br />As an 8 year old in 1978, I liked the usual commmercial music you heard on the radio in those days in the US: Bee Gees, Village People, Stevie Wonder, etc.. Then one day my older cousin left this tape at my house and I found it. I put it my portable cassette recorder (the rectangular, mono ones with the extractable handle) and my life changed. I had no idea what Jim symbolized in popular culture, what he was talking about, nothing. All I knew was that it somehow spoke to me in a way I would only find out when I was old enough to grasp what the Doors message was. So I obviously would recommend this album to anyone and everyone. By the way, I think the performance is way above average considerinfìg that Jim was often too wasted to sing, and the sound is great, almost studio-like.
B000093OU8|5.0|When GM was with Thin Lizzy, they churned out some amazing music. I saw the \\"Black Rose\\" tour with TL at the Apollo Theater in Glasgow (the ULTIMATE venue to see any rock band in the 70s) Moore was simply amazing. This album, for me continues where he left off. The Celtic imagery and nuances that permeate this album define it for what it is. The sort of stuff that TL did brilliantly, songs like Emerald, Black Rose, on this album that style of music is taken to new levels with a passion.  GM has taken on the Celtic Rock mantle passed to him bt Phil Lynott.     There is not one bad track on this album Listen to it with the volume at 10, and dont apologise - you are educating your neighbours! Favourite track is the instrumental \\"The Loner\\" -there are shades of \\"Parisienne Walkways\\" to this track - the guitar playing is something else, it really is in a class of its own. The guitar literally has its neck wrung to get some of these high notes. Buy it, play it, appreciate it. 5 stars dont do it justice.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|Just wow and then some.  I havent really been a Scorpions fan but then again I never disliked them.  They werent just a part of the mix.  I can listen to this cd without any of the preconceptions that others have and do for comparative measures of their earlier stuff.  The compositions, the arrangements and the production of this new work is outstanding.  I cannot find a single flaw.  I am actually moved by some of the ballads and I am not a ballad kind of guy.  Someone else had mentioned it earlier in another review but this is worth repeating.  This is how music should sound in this day and age.  This is modern music in it's purest form.  Hats off to this magificent achievement by the Scorpions!

075640407X|5.0|I had the pleasure of purchasing The Name of the Wind¬ from the author.  Sometimes authors buy from other authors to be supportive.  Sometimes the books purchased are okay.  Sometimes they are wonderful.  The Name of the Wind is wonderful.<br /><br />Kvothe, Rothfuss's main character, is fascinating.  He is mysterious, talented, thoughtful, creative and complex.  The Name of the Wind is the story of Kvothe's life and his quest to find the wind's name.  Kvothe never actually tells the reader the wind's name, which is probably best since names carry power.  The reader also doesn't get all of Kvothe's life.  We participate in his childhood and several years at the university, but there is clearly more to the story.  The book ends with many questions left unanswered.  But oddly enough that fact doesn't frustrate.  I found my appetite whetted for more.  I met a deep, wondrously interesting person in Kvothe.  A person who, no matter how much time I spent talking to, would still hold secrets and have stories yet to tell.<br /><br />I enjoyed The Name of the Wind.  At 662 pages, I was a little surprised by that lack of firm resolution, but it is set up nicely for a sequel and it looks like Patrick Rothfuss has either written or plans to write one. Kvothe's story is an interesting one of magic and mystery set in a fascinating, complex and believable world. I liked the flame-haired Kvothe and was captivated by the story of his life (or the part we see in this installment).  It's well worth picking up.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Laurel Bradley, Author of A Wish in Time<br />[[ASIN:0595409482 A Wish In Time]]
B00009Y3L4|3.0|Cabaret contains some great musical numbers - but the accompanying story is less compelling.<br /><br />Michael York plays a stiff Englishman Brian Roberts newly arrived in 1930s Germany just as the Nazis are coming to power. He meets dancer/prostitute Sally Bowles played by Liza Minelli who works at the seedy Kit Kat club. Many of the musical numbers are set at the club and counterpoint the story.<br /><br />Both York's and Minelli's characters are hard to like. They are morally corrupt and at the end of the film they end up right where they started - without seemingly having learning anything.<br /><br />Minelli copped an Oscar for her performance and there is little doubt that in the musical numbers she is a knockout - as an actress, however, she is somewhat limited. Joel Grey also won an Oscar as the grotesque \\"Master of Proceedings\\" at the Kit Kat club.<br /><br />Despite the trappings the film provides little atmosphere of 1930s Germany, no doubt hampered by its low budget. \\"Cabaret\\" is flashy but somewhat empty.<br /><br />The picture on the DVD transfer is grainy but the sound is OK.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|As much as I asbolutely loved \\"Hybrid Theory\\" and \\"Meteora\\", I knew that when the time came for a 3rd album from Linkin Park, they would need to re-invent themselves in order to maintain their popularity.  Nobody wants to hear the same album over and over again, an artist has to keep things fresh.  Apparently, Linkin Park was very aware of this, and made an album quite different sounding than most of their previous work.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Wake\\" which is just an instrumental intro, and I think it sounds pretty good but it could stand to be longer.  \\"Given Up\\" is a really rockin' tune pumped full of energy, although the guitar isn't as heavy as we're used to hearing from LP.  As fun as the song is, Chester's lyrics are quite dark and he even gives us an awesome scream that lasts for about 30 seconds.  I think this is one of the best tracks on the album.  \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\" mellows things out, and the verse is almost cheesy with a Justin Timberlake vibe. It's still a decent song, and I think it's very catchy chorus could make it a single in the future. Finally, after 3 tracks, Mike Shinoda makes his voice heard on \\"Bleed It Out\\"...a fast catchy tune with a lot of quick rapping from Mike and a chorus from Chester. This song is also very good, but I felt it was too short and they could've added some guitar in the chorus. \\"Shadow Of The Day\\" sounds unlike anything you've ever heard from LP, and it reminds me of U2's \\"With Or Without You.\\" However, I can say it's one of my favorites off the album.  Then comes \\"What I've Done\\", and it probably became the album's first single because of the fact that it's really the only song on the album that sounds like LP's past stuff (kinda like \\"Somewhere I Belong\\").  On \\"Hands Held High\\" Mike comes back to do some rapping but in a more mellow way. This song isn't too bad, but I felt it belonged on a Fort Minor album (Mike's side-project) rather than a Linkin Park album.  \\"No More Sorrow\\" gets things heavy again with more trading off between Chester and Mike. \\"Valentine's Day\\" isn't a bad song but there's nothing special about it which makes it kind of forgettable.  On \\"In Between\\", Mike actually tries his hand at singing for this very mellow tune, and I actually thought it was quite catchy.  The album closes with \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\", a very sad tune that I was pretty impressed by musically. It has some good melodies and I liked that the band finally made a song longer than 3 minutes.<br /><br />So Linkin Park has definitely re-invented themselves, which is great, but I think the album seems to only go in one different direction, rather than several.  Linkin Park has always been a heavy band, with a few melodic moments.  But it seems this album is almost too melodic, with only having about 3 songs that are heavy or energetic.  They did a good job with the mellow songs, but I wanted to see Linkin Park get heavier and also more melodic, and it seems they only did the latter.  Also, the album seems more like a Chester Bennington side-project, as Mike Shinoda only makes himself heard on 4 (maybe 5) songs. Also, I couldn't recall hearing ANY turn-table work from Mr. Hahn.  This album is good, but it seems unbalanced. They did experiment a lot which is great, but they just did too much with melody and not enough with heavy. I would still recommend the album, but I hope they reinvent themselves again for the next album.trading off between Chester and Mike. \\"Valentine's Day\\" isn't a bad song but there's nothing special about it which makes it kind of forgettable.

B000OVLBIU|1.0|Ghost Rider staring Nicholas Cage and Sam Elliott is probably the worse movie that I've seen this year.  My stepson who is 25 says it is one of his favorite movies.  Since kids don't read books anymore, it makes sense that Hollywood is making movies out of comic books.  That's just about their speed. Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie.  I'd much prefer to read John Ringo's latest book.<br /><br />Was that Peter (Easy Rider) Fonda playing the Devil?  How ironic?<br /><br />Poor acting, even though Sam Elliott is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Over the top plot, if there is a plot?<br /><br />Gunner June,2007
B00005O5CM|5.0|So much is great about this film. Ok, it's not flawless - there are a couple of really silly bits - like the courtroom scene with the pool cleaner's guilty admission and his boyfriend's response. But it's great, feel-good fun. Very well directed, tight script for the most-part and the performances are all great.
1582701709|3.0|I'm a bigot. This is the biggest lesson I learned from The Secret. My prejudice: I don't believe a bleach blond woman who brags about her ability to maintain her ideal weight of 116 lbs. despite what she eats can possibly be my guru. Nor can author Rhonda Byrne's millionaire motivational-speaker- chiropractor-investment-counselor buddies or that author who made his fortune off his Chicken Soup warm fuzzies. Sure, they can tell me how to make money, but they can't palm those lessons off as spiritual lessons. That's just cheap and lousy and makes her indistinguishable from the average reap-what-you-sow, look-what-I've-got right wing Christian millionaires.<br /><br />The Secret didn't float my boat--as a book or as a movie that ran like the History Channel's worst nightmare. I was uncomfortable with it because it conflates the acquisition of material wealth with some kind of spiritual quest. You've arrived spiritually when you have as many square feet as the Chicken Soup guy. Quantum physics provides the scientific explanation for this spiritual leap, though not a very deep or satisfying explanation. Basically, thoughts become things, so think millions and you will have them. Byrne reduces quantum physics to some form of latter day alchemy and justifies it by pointing to her wealth and that of her friends.<br /><br />In this book, Helpful Hints from Heloise meets the Harry Potter graphics designer and sells you $25-worth of half-way decent advice. Here are the good ideas that emerge from The Secret:<br /><br />1. The Secret is the law of attraction, which says like attracts like. Your reality embodies your thoughts. Think about the good life, and you'll live it. Think about what's wrong with your life, and there you will be. That's not mysterious; it's true.<br /><br />2. Don't dwell on what you don't want; dwell on what you do want.<br /><br />3. Feel good; do what feels good.<br /><br />4. Imagine yourself having attained your goals. Envision this as if it has happened, and this will help you make it happen. Do not be derailed by the nay-sayers.<br /><br />5. The universe is a kind place and will provide for your needs if you clearly express those needs.<br /><br />All of the above are true. Your life can be good, satisfying, beautiful, and godly if you do these things with a clear understanding that the joy and satisfaction of attaining these things will depend on investing in the relationships around you, in loving your world with a generous heart, and giving everything away. Byrne and her pals left out the other-guy part in their zeal for the \\"all about you\\" bogus mysticism.ot be derailed by the nay-sayers.    5.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|I've seen it about 5 times now (2 in theaters, 3 at home) and I still get into it. The quality of this film on Blu-ray is spectacular and I'm continually impressed. I'd suggest that everyone watch it at least once, even if you're not a fan of the 007 series
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Wow! This is great stuff. I make a living as an artist and wanted to see this movie for the first time when it is was released on DVD. The Day after it was released, nobody seemed to have it immediately available for rent.<br /><br />I purchased my own copy with the idea of selling it when I was finished with it. After watching it I knew this DVD would be a permanent part of my home DVD collection.  A Beautifully executed tale that I had only light familiarity with so I did not already know any spoiler information as the story unfolded.<br /><br />I have not cared much for Ren&eacute;e Zellweger in her past films but she was fine in this movie and all the other casting was superb.  Beautiful scenery and this film pushes buttons in my brain that brings my mind back to different stages of my life.  The film also prompted me to wonder what special talents my pre schoolers will prove to have as they get older.  Will I be able to recognize them?<br /><br />This movie is definitely worth renting and I hope you find it worth owning!
B00030590I|3.0|When ordering [[ASIN:B0007Q6VXM House of Flying Daggers/Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]] I got a recommendation for this film and as the majority of the comments I read were quite favourable, I decided to give it a try. I'm not absolutely dissatisfied with the film as I did like the dresses, colour design, and the visual harmony, however the message of the film, and the whole plot is subordinate to it, is completely unacceptable to me.<br /><br />The film puts the empire ideal on pedestal, which I know is fashionable nowadays even in wealthy democracies, but we have to see that this film is a clear answer to criticisms about the Tianmen square massacre and the cruel oppression of Tibet. The choice of warring kingdoms versus one big peaceful empire is itself a misrepresentation as it neglected the third most obvious possibility: making peace, which I must agree might not have been an option 2000 years ago at the birth of the Chinese Empire but should be now.<br /><br />All in all, the film is watchable, not because of its intellectual level, which could hardly be lower, but because it is just beautiful, the actors and actresses look marvellous in their garbs the colours and styles of which always perfectly match (or harmonise with) the set and the background.
B000CNE164|4.0|This is my introduction to Nina Simone.  I heard \\"Do I Move You\\" in the 4th season sound track of The L word.  I have heard of Nina Simone, but never really bothered to check her out, but I really liked \\"Do I Move You, \\" such a cool song, so I decided to buy this CD.  It is awesome. I think is it a perfect intro to a great singer.  Her voice is so distinct that it can never be copied, and her styling and phrasing is deep.  \\"In the Dark\\" & \\"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl,\\" are absolute gems, but the CD overall is excellent.  My only complaint is the measly 38 minutes, I think there could have been more songs added, but other than that it's a good CD for starters.
B000O1799U|1.0|No disrespect to Ms. Jennifer Hudson, but this was the worst thing I have tried to watch in a long, long time. It was a valiant effort but sometimes you just wanted to scream as it went on and on and on and on. This would have been so much better as a movie and not a musical. It just was not very good to me as I tried to watch it. I had to finally turn it off about 3/4 of the way through it. JMHO and no disrespect intended.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|this album is very good , at first i was alittle put off by its lack of flow , that being one song to another , however as with all thier work there is a listening curve . i will not go song by song because that is stupid and those that choose to do that are just wind bags that wish they were something they will never be ....important. this cd is very good but does not stick with you as with earlier works , white blood cells or the even better de stijl . however for the playlist group there at least 6 songs on here that will make the list ...buy this , nine inch nails \\" year zero\\", fiest \\"reminder' and mavis staple we'll never turn back ....and man you will have a solid base for you summer tunes ...buy this now .
0060090383|5.0|I'll try to keep this short and sweet...    I've read two other Marian Keyes novels and this is my favorite so far.  I have to admit that I wasn't super-excited about the subject matter (drug addiction)but I quickly changed my mind.  It really grabbed me right from the beginning and I found myself genuinely caring about what would happen next to Rachel, the drug-addicted main character.    In the usual style of Marian Keyes, this book is really in touch with what young women think and feel.  But it goes further than that, to delve into the psyche of an addict. It doesn't seem superficial or corny, but rather very real and alarmingly close to home. I found this book to be incredibly believable and touching.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|Will Smith carries this film on his very sturdy shoulders and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he has matured since his `Fresh Prince' days into a very fine actor.  His performance is layered, structured and intelligent, but amidst all of that he still comes across natural and refreshing, never forced or mechanical.  Every emotion runs through his blood effortlessly and full of believable conviction.  I've always been a fan of Smith, but here he returns to the brilliance he possessed in `Ali', coupling his on screen fire with heart and soul that transcends the meaningless boundary's of comic relief but that which leaves a deep rooted sense of character and warmth.  Smith disappears inside Christopher Gardener but he never loses himself, his charm and his commanding presence.<br /><br />`The Pursuit of Happyness' tells the true life story of Christopher Gardener, a family man who gets wrapped up in the wrong pyramid scheme and ends up broke and homeless.  His wife Linda, played by Thandie Newton, walks out on him he's left desolate and alone.  The love for his son Christopher, played brilliantly by Smith's own son Jaden, is what keeps Gardener holding on in pursuit of a better life.<br /><br />One thing that Christopher has going for him is potential.  He's a smart man with ambition and determination and so when he sees an opportunity to rise above himself through an internship with a law-firm he takes it despite the fact of no pay and he uses it to better himself and his surroundings.  Smith's wide range of emotions are what keeps this story compelling and entertaining, from his sadness and grief stricken situation to his cheerful demeanor he masquerades in for his sons sake to that emotional clap of relief as he realizes his dreams amidst a crowded sidewalk, Smith breaks down his own barriers and builds for himself a place alongside the acting giants of today.<br /><br />With pros there must also exist cons, and those cons appear in a few different forms.  The first form is that of co-star Thandie Newton who develops a bad habit of repelling the viewer.  Her character, while unsympathetic in general, is overly unsympathetic not to mention a tad-bit annoying, and that's putting it nicely.  Where's that girl I saw in `Crash' who stole the entire show from her co-stars, who electrified the screen and screamed \\"nominate me\\"?  She's lost albeit in a mess of a character who could have been so much more but turned out so much worse than anticipated.  The flow of the film is a bit choppy as well.  Some parts flow by effortlessly while others drag on and even get a bit redundant.  The director at times tries too hard to emphasize Gardeners destitute condition when that said condition is already made apparent enough for the average viewer.<br /><br />That said, there is still a lot of good to remember when recalling this film, and Will Smith's brilliant performance is reason enough to watch it at least once.  I also must mention Smith's young son Jaden who perfectly compliments his father's passion by effortlessly mastering his performance which is sympathetic, controlled and elegant, never over the top or exaggerated like it could have been.  He comes across as poised as his father and as at home in his performance as an actor who's been doing this all his life.  One day this young actor will reach the feats his father has, and with a beginning as strong as this one he may end up there sooner than later.

B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is the greatest movie ever made.    If you haven't already, watch American Beauty by yourself and give yourself some time afterwards to think it over. You will never, ever look at life the same way. It does exactly what movies are meant to do - give us a window into ourselves, and American Beauty does that better than any other film has ever done. No word of dialogue is unnecessary, no character exaggerated, everything is perfect...but if you have seen American Beauty you should know that already. Once you look closer at this movie, and see Beauty in every frame, it becomes so much easier to look closer and see Beauty in everything around you. You think I'm waxing poetic? Then you must not have seen the movie. Every character is a part of each of us: the Lester Burnham of change, the Carolyn of uncertainty and failure, the rebellion of Jane, the defeated Barbara, the false control of Angela and the Colonel, and the real control of Ricky. To me Ricky, not Lester, is the center of this story; he somehow controls or sets in motion the heart of Lester's rebirth and downfall. There are several parts of this movie where I lose control every time I see it, and none more so than the paper bag scene. To me that scene is simply the greatest monologue ever written.    I listened to the message of American Beauty - look closely and you can find Beauty in anything - and it changed my life. I rose out of a long, deep depression and started out into the world. Sometimes there is so much Beauty in the world, I can't even stand it, and it feels like my heart is going to burst.    This is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen.
B00080ZG10|5.0|It took me a while to see `The Aviator' since word from my friends and family was that the running time was exhausting.  While they have some reason to feel that way personally I feel that the film is so well put together that it more than makes the running time worth while.  Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best here and delivers an award worthy performance as the legend Howard Hughes.  Martin Scorsese delivers as well, directing powerhouse performances with great effects and amazing storytelling capacity.  `The Aviator' truly is a mesmerizing biopic and is probably, but don't quote me on this, the best of the bunch to be released in `the year of the biopic'.<br /><br />The film gracefully covers most of Hughes adult life, exposing his love life and his business escapades not to mention his quarks and obsessions.  Along the way we are introduced to some of Hollywood's most elite, from Katherine Hepburn, played magnificently by Oscar winner Cate Blanchett, to Jean Harlow and Ava Gardner.  His relationships with these women is dissected, mostly when it comes to Hepburn, and the chemistry between both DiCaprio and Blanchett is so effortless that it makes the whole experience comfortable and believable to the viewer.<br /><br />The film, as is apparent by the title, focuses in large part on Hughes obsession with aviation, but it's his other strange obsessions that make a great canvas for DiCaprio's in-depth and articulate performance.  I've always known that there was a great actor underneath those pretty boy looks and thankfully Leonardo took advantage of that when he took this role on full speed ahead.  The way that he delves deep into the madness that overtook Hughes was pure genius, and the way he was able to keep his head, making it believable as apposed to over the top, his commendable and noteworthy.<br /><br />The supporting cast including John C. Reilly, Alec Baldwin, Gwen Stefani, Kate Beckinsale and Jude Law is very impressive, and everyone is on key, but none so much as Alan Alda who plays Senator Brewster, the enemy as you could label him.  The court hearings towards the end of this film where Brewster and Hughes square off are exciting and real and they really show the brilliance of these two actors.  Watching them debate back and forth is so effortless it transcends acting.  It's actually, don't take this wrong, beautiful to watch.<br /><br />Scorsese really outdoes himself here, combining a great true life story with a powerful script that does it's best to flesh out a man who had a lot to uncover, not to mention the fantastic acting and fluid chemistry, making `The Aviator' one of the must see movies of the given year.  I remember watching it and wondering how anyone could walk away feeling indifferent.  Sure, it's not perfect, but it's one of the best films of the year and surely one of the best showcases for pure acting genius.  Scorsese and company is truly to be commended for delivering one great work of art.lays Senator Brewster, the enemy as you could label him.

6305313687|5.0|A good friend of mine suggested this film, and I really didnt know what to expect going in, but after this film was over, I sat in stunned silence. I knew that racism was horrible, but I found through this film that it does not come without a terrible price..the loss of love, friends, family...and the realization that everything that you believed to be true isnt always the way things are. Edward Norton's performance takes the viewer through this journey, and its not a pretty one. He goes from an bright young man, to a vengeful bigot, to a remorseful excon with a brothers life in jeopardy, and you feel as though you are looking in on someones life in the course of 2 hrs. All of the acting in this film is first rate, and the ending wasnt quite as predictable as others might have you believe...it is quite shocking, as is much of the film. It causes quite a debate on the way people view others whos skin color is not the same. As Dr. King said, judge me not on the color of my skin, but on the content of my character. I live with racism, because I am a black man living in America...it exists, but if we educate ourselves like the main character in AHX, it wont stay around for much longer.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published.  The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that neither wants in the beginning but both can scarcely resist by the end.  Other subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own and the various doings of family and friends.  This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of the characters and their actions.<br /><br />The two main characters are probably as well fleshed out as any you are likely to see.  They are certainly complex and multi-layered and they both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses.  The supporting characters are considerably less deep and are almost uniformly caricatures more than anything else.  Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth.  So, does this ruin the book?  Hardly.  Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written as it is a romantic drama and these secondary characters are all part of the tapestry that allowed Miss Austen to skewer her contemporaries so effectively.  There are a few times where I thought a character's behavior was over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it.  Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.
B00005A3KS|4.0|Point Break is one of those films that everybody loves, but that nobody actually talks about all that often. It is a film that if you mention it in conversation, everyone else around is bound to say how much they enjoyed it.    The film's two main assets are unexpected ones, in the form of the direction and the script. The direction by Kathryn Bigelow is nothing short of excellent. Her handling of the action and suspense scenes is exciting and riveting. The two sky-diving scenes are brilliant as is the foot chase through the streets (and houses) of the city. The script, by W. Peter Illif, is also very good and the best thing about the film. The plot is multi-layered and has an original relationship between the hero and the villain. The way the story resolves itself and the ultimate resolutions is excellent, by the standards of most Hollywood action films.    This film deserves to be remembered as one of the better actioners of the nineties, not up there with Die Hard 2/3 or Speed, but better than 90% of the action junk made nowadays. At least this film has a plot.
0743487591|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published.  The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings.  Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends.  The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold.  I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses.  They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see.  The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else.  Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth.  So, does this ruin the book?  Hardly.  These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions.  If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably.  And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama.  Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.  The Enriched Classics edition is also nice because it includes footnotes explaining some of the language and/or references that were well known at the time but confusing today's readers.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great novel.  Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it.  Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.
1591841666|3.0|When I read the title of this book I couldn't help but checking it out. What I found made me think for a little while. The gist of Godin's \\"The Dip\\" makes for more than a good theory, more than a self-help title: it's some great advice in a world where quitting is something that others typically frown upon. Yet, according to him, it may be the best thing to do, given certain conditions are met. He suggests that you decide in advance what those conditions will be, so that you don't choose to leave some unfinished business in the midst of an emotional burst.<br /><br />In general, while the book doesn't take too much time to process (you will hardly need to spend more than a couple of hours on it), you end up feeling the message could have easily been relayed in a shorter format (long blog posts, anybody?). If you can, check it out in the library or (cough, cough!) while sipping a nice Latte (or two) at your local bookstore.
B00005JK8K|3.0|The movie SEEMS to focus on Nic Cage's character.  However, there were other themes that the story teller only half-heartedly explored.  I felt he truly did a poor job developing Nic's change of heart that it made it unrealistic at the end.  Overall he could have done a much better job telling this story, there was so much to work with!

0316067598|5.0|Let me start by saying, even though I'm well past my prime, I'm a big, tough guy. I've been in more than my share of rough situations. What I'm trying to say here is, it's not easy to get me to water up. But this book had me sobbing before I even finished the introduction. Unless you're just absolute pond scum that has no compassion whatsoever for our military, be forewarned this book will definitely have you wiping your eyes more than a few times.<br />Author Patrick Robinson conveys Petty Officer Luttrell's story magnificently. He is to be commended. You will flip through these pages in a day or two and be unable to put this one down.<br />I'm not going to spend much time on the story itself. Just read the book. You'll not find many more graphic descriptions of such things as an almost incomprehensible training regimen, the unique brotherhood that develops among men who have trained and fought together (particularly special forces), courage under fire and an incredible network of support for a fallen loved one.<br />You will have a plethora of personal emotions exposed. For me, I think what drove hardest upon my psyche is the intense hatred I feel after reading this book, not of the Taliban and Al Queda (although they rank right up there in the I freakin' hate your guts department), but rather of two entities right here in America; the National media and the U.S. Congress. This mission cost us twenty-three of our very finest, and those two entities are directly responsible for their deaths and countless others. They should all have their ROE shoved right up their backsides.<br />Not since our government disbanded the great American military fighting force of WWII in 1945 have they given the military the support needed to win wars. Sure they've provided the proper equipment and training, but then they have sent our troops into battle time after time with their hands tied behind their backs. The guys in Korea got a taste of it. We damned sure got plenty of it in Nam. They sort of allowed the guys in Gulf War I to do their job, but now, it's just over the top.<br />And then you've got the piece of [...] news media. 98% of those pukes ought to be ,.... Well, okay, I'm ranting now and not reviewing, so let me get a grip. In war there is always an army defending freedom and an army seeking to destroy freedom. Whichever army wins will determine the difference between freedom and slavery for that nation. It's obvious which side many in the news media and in Washington D.C. are pulling for.<br />Marcus Luttrell is a true American hero. As are his fallen team members. I am thankful Marcus is a U.S. Navy Seal. I am thankful he decided to make this story known. I am thankful to my grandchildren for giving me this book for Father's Day. I have several new names and families to hold in my prayers.allowed the guys in Gulf War I to do their job, but now, it's just over the top.

B00005JPQP|5.0|Danny Ocean (Clooney) and his gang are back, this time to get revenge against Willie Bank (Pacino). Bank has screwed over Reuben Tishkoff (Gould), and taken his land and money to build a new casino, causing Reuben to have a heart attack.  The gang, led by Ocean, Rusty Ryan (Pitt), and Linus Caldwell (Damon), decide to put the new casino deep into the red and steal Bank's diamonds.<br /><br />\\"Ocean's 13\\" is a vast improvement over \\"12\\" and on par with \\"11\\", if not a little better.  The cast know their characters so well by this point and have a great chemistry.  You know that they had fun making this movie, and it shows.  The action is minimum, but interest is sustained through following their plan as it comes to fruition.  There are some twists, but nothing earth-shattering.  Mostly, this is a chance to see good actors doing their thing.  Fans of this series will not be disappointed, and although director Steven Soderbergh says this is the last one, I can't help but hope that he changes his mind.
0385338082|5.0|It won't take you long to read this wonderful book! It's witty, charming, funny, fresh and worth taking an afternoon or two to read. Sophie Kinsella captures embarassing moments in hysterical ways but always manages to make her heroines shine! Good Read - in fact, all of her books are.
1594489505|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying The Kite Runner, I couldn't wait to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. Once again, I found Mr. Hosseini's latest release to be a compulsive page turner that kept me up way too late because I wanted to keep reading. I was totally entranced with the lives of these two women. I now find myself with an interest in Afghanistan that I never had before thanks to these two enlightening books. Highly recommend.
0380715430|3.0|The first half of this book is an eminently enjoyable breeze through the history of the English language, and its roots in Scandinavia, Germany, and French, as well as a fun romp through the way English spelling and grammar changed over time. Unfortunately, as the book went on, it started to lose steam and the thesis started getting stretched pretty thin. I managed to slog through and finish it, but I can't recommend it.
B000P0J024|5.0|Being that I retired from the music business and, after hearing the Wilburys, started playing again...  I am just a wee bit biased.<br /><br />This package is about as perfect as it could be.  There is somewhat of a limit on what could have been done on the DVD but it is still a treat.  The END OF THE LINE video reminds me of the classiest tribute that rock and roll has ever had, the guitar strewn rocking chair saving Roy Orbison's place.  Still brings tears to my eyes.  He died on top!<br /><br />The harmonies, the varied voices (the best voice in rock (Orbison) to the weary voices of Petty and Dylan and peak-career voices of Lynne and Harrison) plus the songwriting.  Damn, magic in a bottle!<br /><br />This is a true super-group.  Not hiding behind instruments, voices drive this train!<br /><br />The astral plane has been busy lately, George and Roy are having a party.  A new generation will hear the long-discontinued Wilburys discs.  Check out Dhani Harrison's debut project thenewno2 (they're a dot com too).
B000OYC3J8|4.0|It's hard not to think that Jack White has developed something of an ego--after all, when music critics call you a genius for anything as small as slapping an organ around a bit, it must be hard not to get a little bit of a God complex.<br /><br />But if he has, he has not let it diffuse the element of play and seeming improvisation that brings the White Stripes sound together.  The White Stripes is where Jack White is at the height of his powers.  His brief excursion into The Raconteurs with [[ASIN:B000F48CD8 Broken Boy Soldiers]] felt too constricted and lacking energy, and in other projects he didn't sound as though he was having all that much fun.  Many regard [[ASIN:B00097A5H2 Get Behind Me Satan]] as dark White Stripes, but I don't go along with that diagnosis--there are way too many fluctuations about that disc even that keeps me from thinking that Jack and Meg were getting too dour during that recording session.<br /><br />With rock 'n' roll creature Meg White, the music becomes music again, playing with all types of sounds and styles and maybe even poking a little fun at musical schools that we may take a little too seriously.  This IS rock, after all, and if we can end \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\" with a repetitive La chorus, what the hell?  Why not?  \\"Rag and Bone\\" is an exquisite track with its shout-outs as though one is listening in on take 1, and the plain out noise assault of the the title track lets you know that you're not in for the the old heavy-yet-light-since-there-are-only-two-of-them bluesiness of [[ASIN:B000068OSK The White Stripes]], but a pair who have spread their sound out wider and into something of a full arc.  The snideness of \\"You Just Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told),\\" and the garage-can twanginess into submarine assault with \\"Catch Hell Blues\\"--every song works at being its own tone poem, sounding at times like a radio dial flipping about to give one snatches of different styles and stations (that is, in the days when you could tell one radio station from another).<br /><br />But, just in case you thought that the Stripes might have left behind their heavy blues influence, they give you that purity of back-porch blues with \\"Effect and Cause.\\"  I love this playfulness about them, their willingness to explore anything (even if it's something they've explored before) if the song leads them to it.<br /><br />This album isn't the profound and unannounced classic that [[ASIN:B000068OSJ De Stijl]] is, but it's solid White Stripes stuff--which is to say that it's diverse, imaginative, entertaining on both sides of the speaker, and a foot-stomping good time.<br /><br />Rock on.d tell one radio station from another).

0515141429|4.0|Having read the newest of Lee Child's i.e. Bad Luck and Trouble, I decided to begin all over again and get reacquainted with Reacher from the first.  Killing Floor is in the first person. You get to hear Jack's every thought and emotion.  He is certainly not the most literate of men, but his intentions are honorable.    After finding out the initial corpse was his brother, Joe (and it hits you between the eyes)Jack gets down to business to solve the Town of Margrave's enigma.    It is a fun ride. The money laundering scheme is plausible but at the same time preposterous.  Hey, it could happen.  Lee Childs sometimes goes over the top and you just have to trust in a great ride of an adventure. One of the reasons I read Lee Childs is to find out how Reacher uses his brain and brawn to get out of tense situations. I dont care how he does it; I am on his side!!!!    As Jack fades into the sunset at the end of the book, your heart goes with him and you want to search out the next installment.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I have always been a huge LP fan.  Minutes to Midnight disappointed me for a few reasons.    <br />  <br />First of all, they have lost their intensity.  Hybrid and Meteora were chalked full of hard-hitting and aggressive songs that were awesome.  In Minutes to Midnight, they tried to get a little too artsy for me.  There are only about 3 or 4 songs I really like, and the rest are just ok.    <br />  <br />Secondly, I have always admired LP for being clean.  Chester even said in 2002 that being vulgar adds nothing to music.  There are several F-bombs, which I am not offended by, but sad that they lost something that set them apart from others.    <br />  <br />Finally, what bugged me was their political lyrics. I have loved LP in years past for staying out of politics; I wish more musicians would.  If I want political insight, I am not going ask people who went to art school for graphic design.  In their song \\"Hands Held High\\" they make the classic musician cop out of Bush hating.  Real original guys.  For me that ruined a great song.  <br />  <br />Needless to say, LP needs to get back to what made them famous, Clean hard hitting music with no baggage, not the same crap we hear from other bands with half the talent.  <br />  <br />Looking forward to their next album...
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded has one thing that simply stands out throughout the movie - complete eye candy.  Its true, while the first Matrix brought about new origins in movie animation and cgi, Matrix Reloaded takes it x100.  The action is amazing, it will blow you away almost to the point that you've had enough.  Major action and visual effects fans will dig this.  True harcorde fans of the Matrix story might be dissapointed.<br /><br />The story almost takes a backseat to the action.  The plot is dragged out throughout huge action scenes that seem to never end -  example-  Neo vs dozens of Smiths lasting forever, and the highway chase that lasts as long as I-95 runs.  While these scenes are truly spectacular, they take away from the story somewhat.  Gone is the great in depth exploration into the Matrix.  Very little is newly introduced to us about the Matrix, and the story now focuses on Neo and the rest of humanity saving itself from destruction, both from the machines in the real world, and Smith in the Matrix world.  We do get to meet the architect of the Matrix, though not as astounding as one would think.<br /><br />Overall this is not as good as the first one, but you'll still want to see it to see how the trilogy continues.  If you love never-ending action and cgi, you will want to watch this over and over and over.  The movie is worth buying on that regard.  As for a compeleing story, you might be ok stopping after the first Matrix and being satisfied.  If you do see Reloaded, you'll have to see Revolutions too, since both technically are one big film split into 2 parts.
B000MRA5EM|2.0|Absolutely cringeworthy commentary from Mr. Depp and (especially) Ms. Winslett. People who write this sort of thing ought to be taken out and shot for their own good. Poor music score too. The pikkies are nice, but not a patch on the BBC's magnificent \\"Blue Planet\\". The environmental message at the end, while welcome, seems tacked on almost as an afterthought.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Conclusion is what Revolutions is, bringing and ended to the explosive Matrix Trilogy.  A direct continuation from Reloaded, Revolutions is once again more eye candy than anything else, with the actual Matrix getting less screen time than the first 2 films.  The focus is on the great war in Zion city, against the machines.  Its true, the best action and story in this movie all take place in the real world.  But there is still plenty of Matrix involved, but only in the beginning and end of the film.<br /><br />The ending is predictable, but the journey to reach the conclusion has smaller twists and turns along the way that are unexpected.  The movie is very intense, in terms of action and cgi.  It is truly a thrill ride and we finally get to see an army of mechs unleash their firepower upon the sentinels in Zion city.  Neo and Smith face off in their final battle.  Unlike the first Matrix, which incorporated a nice blend of realistic martial arts and wirework, this battle is more cgi and expands to the 2 barely fighting on any ground, thus limiting the true martial arts.  Not a bad fight, but its ridiculously overdone and not very pretty.<br /><br />Some say this movie is just plain bad, but I don't believe that is true.  Most people want to compare it to the first Matrix, but independently its not a bad movie.  While it is not nearly as good as the first Matrix, it is still a great movie, but just like Reloaded, the story effort is not as strong as the first Matrix, and the focus seems to be on the action.  You'll want to see Reloaded before Revolutions, simply because Reloaded is part 1 and Revolutions is pt2.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Delightful, just delightful. Zellweger is perfect in the role of Potter - compelling and you do think it's actually Beatrix Potter. Ewan MacGregor is a joy to watch smile right from his eyes, the character's enthusiasm seems his own. He and Emily Watson shine like morning sunshine in this absolutely beautiful film.  I thought it was better than \\"The Queen\\" which I also saw recently. I also loved \\"The Painted Veil\\" with Naomi Watts. But there is something so delightfully sweet and moving about \\"Miss Potter\\" it should NOT be missed! You will cry at the love and loss in this movie. It was definitely a tear-jerker at times, but ultimately provided a very satisfying ending.
1894502701|1.0|I am and continue to be a long-time fan of Robert Munsch. His stories are among my favorites to read to my preschool class. They love to listen to audio books as well, but this cd simply won't do. He reads far too fast for the children to fully comprehend his words or the details of the stories. Plus, he's reading aloud to a group of children - live - and it would seem that to make them laugh he has to ham it up, making loud ridiculous sounds while narrating maniacally a mile a minute. I love when stories are read in an animated style, but his really turned me off. This was a very disappointing purchase. I won't be playing it again.<br /><br />P.S. Read his books: Paper Bag Princess, Stephanie's Ponytail, More Pies, and Smelly Socks are big hits among my 3- & 4-year-old students.

Mark Wahlberg looks like the next big box office draw in the same vain as Bruce Willis. The movie has many eye opening political slams and last but not least it was entertaining!
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I loved this movie!!  This is not a \\"chick flick\\".  It is so hard to imagine that things were so restrictive for women just 50 years ago, and it seems that we need to be reminded as we take all that is open and available to us and the many opportunities we have in stride. It's  unbelievable how things have changed - I am going to have my teenage daughter watch this movie, she will be astounded!    The movie is also beautifully filmed (much of it in Massachusetts on the gorgeous Wellesley College campus). I highly recommend this movie.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Words cannot sum up my love for this movie.  It's unique, quirky, funny, romantic, sad, and simply fascinating.<br /><br />One of the movie's masterstrokes was the way that time was handled.  If you don't already know, Joel (Jim Carrey) decides to have the memory of his ex-girlfriend (Clementine - Kate Winslet) erased after she did the same to him.  Most of the movie takes place in his memories as they are being erased.  However, the memories are erased in reverse-chronological order.  So it starts with these very negative memories about their breakup which only confirm the need for the operation.  Then, as he travels back in time through more positive memories, he realizes how much he still loves her and he changes his mind about the operation.  Of course, since he's asleep, he has trouble figuring out a way to do that.  If the movie had shown their relationship go from good to bad, then it would not have been near as touching.  Here we get to see that no matter how bad things seem, there are always good memories and the love is still inside somewhere.  Both hopelessness and the feeling of love build up concurrently making the film a very intense emotional experience.  The last memories (chronologically the first) were unbelievably touching.<br /><br />Another thing that made this film great was the dialogue.  In modern films, it is rare to see dialogue so eloquent.  If you like classic movies, then this may be your film.  The dialogue was one of the reasons that the scene in the beachhouse moved me so much.<br /><br />The music needs mention too.  The soundtrack is amazing and very emotional.  My favorites are the song played during the opening and closing credits and the song that was played backwards (fitting, huh?) before, during, and after the beachhouse scene.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, do so immediately.  It is so unique and very touching.  It also has some nice comedic moments although the film is more of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" romance than a comedy.  Being an image-conscious male, the number of movies that made me cry I can count on one hand.  This one is the pinky.ale, the number of movies that made me cry I can count on one hand.  This one is the pinky.
B000N3T0DW|2.0|We are not meant to take the story seriously, so we don't.  Then what remains?  The notion that women share a special bond that men can never understand, because men are lying, shiftless, drunken, cheating, incestuous, pedophilic rapists.  Some interesting glimpses of Spanish village life.  And Penelope Cruz, warm and gorgeous, who almost makes the film worth watching.
0060589469|5.0|This is one of those books that can truly alter your mode of thinking. I have read it multiple times and continue to come back to it. It's a MUST READ. Don't miss this one.
1400044162|5.0|I enjoyed and savored this book from beginning to end.  I was absolutely transported to the time, early and late sixties during the Biafran/Nigerian war and the ill-fated struggle for a free Biafran/Igbo country.  These were amazing characters to carry such a lofty social, political, emotionally charged story.  Ugwu was a favorite character in recent history.  Adichie's writing is beautiful, sympathetic and while racism abounded during that time, she doesn't stoop to be stereotypical with any of her characters, nor presuppose what must be in the mind(s) of \\"every Igbo academic\\" or \\"every British white male\\" etc.  These are complex, layered characters.  I think that is an amazing accomplishment.  The tragedies of the Igbo upper class suddenly left starving and lost in the struggle for free Biafra were so well drawn, down to the details of soap, protein pill and the day-to-day sadness and lost hope of the people.  Even minor characters left me with images, both the wartime horror and the daily human beauty, that I won't soon forget.  I know this book just won the Orange award, but I'm suprised this novel has not gotten more recognition.  It truly is an amazing book, in talent, story, subject matter.  It also is hopeful and probably the finest fictional account (although largely based on fact) of one section of African history I have ever read ... and I have read quite a bit.  Pick up this book and get lost for a few days ...
B000NIVJHM|4.0|You have probably seen it, but have you seen it recently ?  There are many details to absorb, with a fast moving although predictable plot. Nevertheless, various nuances appear each time I watch this movie.<br />First of all, you will have to suspend your disbelief. Would even a wealthy father like Dr Houseman give his daughter hundreds of dollars without knowing what it was for, the equivalent of thousands today? Would a young woman like Baby be able to sneak around with Johnny in a small resort like that, full of busybodies, and keep it a secret for more than 24 hours?<br />Apparently as others have written, there are some anachronisms in the film. To me, they were not glaring. Baby's mohair sweaters convinced me we were definitely in a different era. The activity list alone, was enough to set me in the past. Dance lessons, charades, bingo, arts and crafts, yawn.....and where is the booze in this movie? Alcohol is curiously absent, for a group of semi rowdy young adults. But I digress..<br /><br />The universal emotional tug of this movie is that it will remind you of something, or someone. Most likely your own coming of age story. Which probably didn't happen in the Catskills, or at a summer resort. But it doesn't matter, because everyone has a season where they discover not just themselves, but also some fundamental truths about life. That people and things are often not what they seem. That life requires embracing tough ambiguities.<br />So suspend your disbelief, ignore the inconsistencies and enjoy the steam, the dancing and the music.<br /><br />Most young people have a season, often a summer, where life's mysteries are suddenly thrust upon them and innocence is lost. This is the story of &#34;Baby&#34;  Houseman growing up the summer before she starts college. While she loses her virginity, there is more to the story than that. She also learns that everything she has ever been taught is subject to scrutiny and often wrong. This movie will bring back memories even if you never vacationed in the Catskills with your parents. Dirty Dancing manages to weave several universal coming of age themes into an almost believable story. Plus some really cool looking dancing.<br />Swayze and Grey are both about 10 years older than the characters they portray, but they pull it off and their chemistry sizzles. Great music, too, both the oldies featured and the soundtrack written for the film.<br />I know there are people that have seen this movie thousands of times. While I wouldn't do that, I did enjoy picking up on some small details that I never noticed before. Like leaves falling pretty furiously in the background in one scene. The movie was shot in the early fall and some leaves had to be spray painted green, as well.<br />Probably the theme that resonates with me the most is the dawning of Baby's moral understanding. She  has been taught to think in terms of black and white, good vs evil, however many people are not exactly what they seem and there are a lot of incongruities in life.<br /><br />5 stars for the memories. It is not great cinema, but great to watch again, even if you have seen it several times. Even if you didn't experience anything exactly like this, you will still remember your youth.oned in the Catskills with your parents.

B000P0J024|5.0|What a terrific decision to put these five guys together to make such great music! Sad that smoking has already killed off two of them - no chance for a reunion. George and, especially, Roy O., died far too early. Two more reasons to ban the tobacco drug.
B00005N5S2|4.0|Beautifully filmed, but MacArthur, an epic American general, should have been a 3-hour film instead of the 130 minutes they sliced it into. I kept sensing they had cut scenes.  Fux pas: Gregory Peck (1) points to Lingayen Gulf in Luzon and vows to land at Leyte, (2) salutes President Truman at the 1950 Wake Island meeting when we all know MacArthur infuriated Truman by failing to salute, and (3) keeps saying \\"please\\" when he gives orders. I just can't imagine General MacArthur saying \\"please\\" as he barks the commands. But overall, a good film.
B000J10ER4|4.0|Superman hears about the discovery of the remains of the planet Krypton. So he disappears for five years to check it out. When he returns, he finds that the world has moved on without him. Lois Lane has a child and lives with her boyfriend (who happens to Perry White's son).     Superman feels a bit lost in the modern world. But he makes a stunning and dramatic reappearance and immediately gets back to doing what he does best: fighting crime and upholding truth and justice.    In the meantime, his old rival Lex Luthor (played by Kevin Spacey) plots against him and against the United States of America. The movie is full of humanity and compassion. It presents a modernized Superman for the 21st century.    My only complaints are that Superman looks a little too digital and cartoonish when dressed in his costume. Also, the film spends too much time with Lex Luthor's plot when in my view he isn't worth the time. Not only that, Kevin Spacey's Luthor lacks the humor and likeability of Gene Hackman's Luthor. This new Luthor is all creep.    But the storyline is intriguing and Superman's interactions with Lois Lane and her child make for compelling viewing. Recommended.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Ok, so after just receiving my long awaited copy of \\"Blow by Blow\\", Digitally Remastered, Reissued and Remixed by George Martin my vote is final. This is `one' of the all-time best guitar master works ever (mostly for the uniqueness of Beck's playing and the stellar musical content here). \\"Scatterbrain\\", \\"Cause We've Ended As Lovers\\", \\"Freeway Jam\\" and of course \\"Diamond Dust\\" being the highlights. The other trac's are also very worthy grooves on this CD. The playback on a pro rig is incredible but it also sounds great on my iPod ripped in high-res. :-) Listen to the complete work.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|Sometimes a flaming skull can be the mask of an avenging angel.<br /><br />First of all I admit that I am a long time fan of the Ghost Rider comic series. I waited for this movie to get made for years- through all the delays. Now that it has been made I am not disappointed. I thought that this was a very good job of writing, acting, casting, and special effects.<br /><br />The first thing you have to realize is that this is a morality play. The Rider is the Spirit of Vengeance. He instantly knows the guilty from the innocent. His greatest weapon is his ability to make criminals feel their victims pain through his \\"penance stare.\\" He is supposed to be disturbing, upsetting, frightening. If you have a problem with paying for your crimes then you are going to have a problem with the Rider...<br /><br />I especially liked the tribute to the original western Ghost Rider (excellently played by Sam Elliot) and his tie in to the mythos of the Johnny Blaze incarnation. It was so appropriate to use the old \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\" theme here for it was the original inspiration for the character.<br /><br />I wouldn't hesitate to allow children to watch this, but I would watch with them and explain it. Blaze made a deal with the devil, but he did it for unselfish, sacrificial reasons. And while the devil got his soul, he didn't get his spirit. The Ghost Rider is darkness in the service of light. He willed himself from the devil's bounty hunter to his greatest nemesis on earth. He owned his curse and turned the devil's power against him. And the Rider never, ever harms the innocent.<br /><br />Yeah, I liked the craftsmanship and I liked the message- a lot.
1402573219|3.0|The good news about this book is that it is an interesting story. What bothered me (and other reviewers, it seems) was the lack of editing; geez Louise! Every possible artsy analogy was gratuitously thrown in, and just got cloying and annoyingly in the way of the story. Also, all of the characters speak with the same voice; I don't know when the last time Jodi Picoult was next to a 13 year old, but I'm here to tell you, a lot of those words do NOT come out of an adolescent's mouth, period. The subplot of brother Jesse, ending with a police citation for a drugbust, after not being prosecuted for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of arson, simply does not ring true - this boy needs real help; sitcom cures aren't real. The subplot of the father, Brian, also went nowhere. The mother was a monster, also an unrealistic character. The book got my 3 stars, because I was engaged by the plot. The ending was not maddening, just lousy.
B0000041WV|5.0|The late Istvan Kertesz continues to amaze, with this spectacular reissue of his 1960s Dvorak symphonies cycle.  These versions each compare well with or exceed the legendary recordings by Ancerl, Szell, Talich, et al.  Sound quality is excellent, and the mix on the orchestra is almost always just right, balancing strings, brass, and percussion.  Compared to some Czech recordings, the woodwinds volumes are a bit weak, which is unfortunate because woodwinds are one of Dvorak's specialties.  If you have no other set of Dvorak symphonies, or have 10 copies of \\"From the New World\\" and no copies of Symphonies 1, 2 or 3, then this is a must-have set.  From the opening bars of Symphony No. 1, you'll agree you're in the presence of greatness.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I saw the movie, it was pretty good.  I listened to the soundtrack, even better.  Great incorporation of old and new themes from across the trilogy.  It's worth the money just for the songs \\"Up is Down,\\" \\"Caplypso,\\" and \\"I Don't Think Now Is The Best Time.\\"  Buy it!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The collection includes all ten seasons divided among six individual books of DVDs.  Each book features a different cast member, with photographs on the cover of the book as well as on each of the DVDs.  Given that there are six books and ten seasons, the season split across different books but it isn't a problem.  Start at the first, work to the last, all ten seasons in a row.  If you want a particular show from a particular season just grab the included booklet and it lists each of the DVDs with episodes.  If you are a fan of the show, want all ten seasons, this is a great way to get them.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Some people just don't like dark chocolate. This movie gets short shrift from reviewers who don't care for its slow pace and that it requires a bit of thinking. The reviewer below suggests that Clooney would rather not have done this film. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Clooney applied for this role. This is a love story and a psychological mystery/sci-fi/thriller. It's an intensely suspenseful and fascinating story in which all the actors give excellent performances.
0930289234|3.0|Every once on awhile, Amazon loses a review. I posted one on Watchmen three days ago and it hasn't appeared yet, so here it is again, more or less the same.<br /><br />First of all, I had difficulty learning to read when I was a kid, so much so that my first grade teacher recommended psychiatric help (this was before the days of \\"learning disability\\"). Comic books saved me. I still remember my first one, a World War II yarn where the stranded sailors somehow or other got mixed up with dinosaurs. I loved it. Thor, Captain America, The Fantastic Four and Spiderman soon followed.<br /><br />I just mention the above as evidence that I do not look down on comic books. I love comic books, and I wanted to love Watchmen. I expected to love it. It won a Hugo, after all. Well...it started off great, with the murder of a retired costumed hero, the Comedian. We're soon introduced to Rorschach, a somewhat mentally disturbed but very effective sort of good guy and a bunch of other costumed heroes, most now retired.<br /><br />The book went downhill soon after. One of the good guys, a Superman clone, is framed and goes off to Mars in a huff. A very boring chapter of his philosophical depression then follows. In the end, the \\"bad\\" guy is too powerful to be believed (he's a human without supernatural powers but he can catch a bullet in his hand--I don't think so), the plot too complex to be plausible and it depends, to a large extent, upon science that had not been previously introduced. You can use cloning and telepathy (to give an example) only if you introduce cloning and telepathy early in the story. It's like Kirk saying, \\"Scotty, time for the interdimensional transport beam,\\" when no such thing has ever been mentioned. The reader does not appreciate such cheap tricks. In the end, this is a pompous work that takes itself way too seriously. Too bad. It could have been great.

B000P2A256|5.0|I bought this album with fresh ears for M5. Although I had heard Harder to Breath, She Will Be Loved, and of course, This Love, I never managed to buy the album. So, SAJ was heard as an aftermath from It Won't Be Soon Before Long. I can't understand those who try to compare this album with the debut, it's been 5 long years since SAJ and many, many live performances. They are in a totally different place musically, personally and professionally and you can hear it on both. Does that mean that one is lesser than another? Absolutely not, I think each are stand alone albums and have incredible songs on each. While SAJ is much more soul-like and funkier, IWBSBL is pure pop fun. As a child of the 80's, I distinctly remember all of the influences that appear on this album and it's absolutely addicting. I would have no problem recommending this to my family and friends as one of the best for 2007. Good luck to Adam and the guys on this one, I hope it garners them more accolades, awards, and record breakers. They did a fabulous job and deserve their success!

B00006879E|5.0|After hearing the second album in it's entirety, I had to buy this one immediately. In an age where it seems like 2-3 songs are single-worthy and all the rest is filler, it's absolutely refreshing to find two CD's that I don't want to skip ANY of the songs! Each album is as close to near perfect in their own different ways. I can't find fault with 5 guys who sing, write, and play their own stuff and you can't fault them for finding commercial success. They do an amazing job of writing evocative lyrics, blending all of their instruments so that no one person stands out, while Levine adds his haunting and individual voice on top. Add everything together and it's no wonder this album is such a staple for a music fan's collection regardless of their favorite genre.
B00005JPO8|5.0|One thing I liked about this film is that took off in a completely different direction than where I thought it was going in the opening scenes. I thought it would concentrate on the Machiavellian Stasi boss or the lecherous arts minister or the handsome debonair writer. Ulrich Muhe is almost invisible at the beginning as the Stasi agent who suspects a potential for subversion in East Germany's most politically correct playwright.   <br />  <br />But this is a film about an idealist who sees his vision of socialism so perverted and corrupted by those above him that he is compelled to protect the artists he is supposed to be scrutinizing. Ironically it is not the writer who suffers for his first tentative act of rebellion (although his actress girlfriend is so horrified by her betrayal of him that she runs into the path of an oncoming car). Rather it is the Stasi agent who commits career suicide and is consigned to steaming open letters in the dingy basement corridor of a post office. In the end, after the demise of the Berlin Wall, the fame and accolades continue to accrue to the artist who merely records for posterity the acts of heroism of a man who remains a nameless and faceless cipher.   <br />  <br />I found the symbolism of the film to be beautiful and subtle, from the actress who could never quite believe in herself to the prostitute who managed to slip through the security system of a building full of Stasi agents to the Bertholt Brecht passage about the evanescence of one's dreams.
B0001US8EO|3.0|Released a year after another Wyatt Earp bio-pic, 1993's Tombstone (which featured Kurt Russell in the role), Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp is a would-be western epic that is supremely disappointing.  Kevin Costner (who also served as producer) is in the title role as the legendary lawman in this incredibly overlong look at the life and times of Wyatt Earp, and his droll performance is what really hurts Kasdan's overall vision.  Despite that though, it's hard not to admire the effort that Kasdan and co. had put into making this film.  Many slow moments aside, Kasdan manages to present a more personal tale of Earp's life than that of what we saw in Tombstone, and that in itself sets Wyatt Earp apart from the modern western pack.  The rest of the cast, which includes Gene Hackman as Earp's father, Dennis Quaid in a fine performance as Doc Holiday (I still prefer Val Kilmer though), as well as Michael Madsen, Linden Ashby, David Andrews, Jeff Fahey, Joanna Going, Mark Harmon, Bill Pullman, Isabella Rossellini, Tom Sizemore, JoBeth Williams, Adam Baldwin, James Caviezel, and Tea Leoni, don't always fare as well as one would hope, but the overall atmosphere that Kasdan weaves manages to make up for most of the casting shortcomings.  This Two-Disc Special Edition doesn't really pack it in on the special features department (no commentary at all), but the film is presented here in all it's widescreen glory, and it looks fantastic and better than ever thanks to the outstanding picture quality.  You may prefer Tombstone over Wyatt Earp or vise versa, but either way you look at it, Wyatt Earp is an overly ambitious project that isn't without it's disappointments.
0385522401|4.0|This was the first McEwan book I've read and I know he'll be an author I'll look forward to reading more in the future.  This was a thin volume, but there was so much more to read in between the lines.  The pent up sexual frustration, the questionable pasts, the hostilities...<br /><br />Both Florence and Edward have their inadequacies, but I truly liked their characters, even when I wanted to scream at them in frustration.  Their wedding night reveals the fatality of communication, or lack thereof.  McEwan conveys a strong atmosphere and a look into the psyches of Florence and Edward, and I was left with questionable sympathies for both of them.
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those books that you'll either love or you'll hate. Much like the main character's English teacher describes L'Etranger, it's 'very easy to read, but very hard to read well.\\" And I can see how some people might think it trite or boring, or a bit over-angsty. I feel the exact opposite, but hey, to each his own. I think this is one of those books that came along right when I needed it. Much in the way that I read the Catcher in the Rye when I was 15 years old and uncertain about my place in the world and that book helped me put things into perspective, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a good book to read when you're feeling mellow and introspective and really want to think about things for awhile. Or at least it was for me. The character of Charlie was an introspective, overly empathetic mess, but wondering about his actions and thinking about their repercussions made me not want to put this book down the entire time that I was reading it. I love love loved this story and would recommend it to anyone in the mood for a painfully honest and true portrayal of what it's like to grow up and wonder if you'll ever find your niche.
B00005JPRT|4.0|I decided to see this on a whim, not really knowing what it was about. It was just what I needed. As someone who has been going through a lot of stress lately and not really listening to music, it reminded me to bring the music back. If the songs were not good, there is no way that I would have made it through the film.<br /><br />A man and a woman meet while he is playing guitar and singing in the street for money. She wants to hear more. He is a little jaded from his last relationship, but he can't help but like her. Later on, he finds out that she plays piano and they come together in the piano store to play a song together. That was my favorite song in the movie. I found myself glued to the screen, and then, my mind wandering, because it reminded me that I need to discover some new music.<br /><br />Things don't always end in life they way they do in Hollywood movies (and I'm glad for that) but you still can't help dropping a few tears. So touching and beautiful. I will definitely buy the soundtrack.
B000P2A24W|3.0|I've been a fan of bon jovi since 1988(new jersey)old fans would have notice the changes in JBJ's vocal style, however since \\"destination anywhere\\" I keep wondering where goes his briliant vocals in \\"keep the faith to these days\\" era? about lost highway still i'm waiting for JBJ's rock voice, however their recent album have much potency in commercial teritory. musically i think bon jovi is fair enough to include old sound and new sound as well to please old and new fans. to me, I would give 5 Stars if JBJ sings like in \\"These days\\" and for the music i think richie, tico and david have done fantastic job. by the way, i've noticed the moffats sound in \\"one step closer\\". have you noticed to??????????
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Dear Rihanna, I used to think you were not gonna last, thought A Girl like Me was gonna be the last noticed album but now with this album, you just prove you are in the game to last.  I can't stop playing \\"Rehab\\" which is my fav on this album. The part I enjoy the most is when the broken-hearted Rihanna keeps on singing (and she really does it):\\"...It's like I checked into rehab, Baby you're my disease....\\"  This track is simply a missile, the beat, the production, the performance, the chorus, Rehab is woow! Timbaland did a fantastic work!<br /><br />My 2nd fav is the mid tempo, awe-inspiring track \\"Say it\\". It's got a nice melody, great lyrics on top of her outstanding performance. The song finds Rihanna beseeching her man to put away his pride and say it...  If you say it maybe you can spend the night\\". Who can resist getting it off the chest with such a noble invite? Great great song!<br /><br />Good girl gone bad is an electric rock track that sounds like it was taken from Avril Lavigne's debut album, top stuff! Rihanna continues to rock with Shut up & Drive, a solid track that reminds me of That Don't Impress Me Much by Shania Twain and to prove her versatility, Rihanna skilfully switch to reggae with the superb dancehall beat Lemme get that!<br /><br />Her voice gets even sweeter on \\"Hate that I love You\\" feat Ne-Yo which although it sounds like a poor remix of \\"So Sick\\" is still a amazing track! I'm not gonna talk about the massive hit Umbrella and I'm still convinced that even if Kobe, Bill Gates, Barack Obama or anybody had replaced Jay-Z as a guest rapper, it still was gonna top the charts like it did in almost every country in the world because it's easy to feel that his contribution wasn't necessary. The Cinderella remix with Chris Brown is not bad as well!<br /><br />I think Rihanna has proved with such a consistent album that she's not a mere one hit-maker wonder and therefore, moved out of the box where most of the generic contemporary female singers have already tasted the last drop of their ephemeral success. Rihanna is a good girl with a potential of going Diva now!op of their ephemeral success. Rihanna is a good girl with a potential of going Diva now!
B000PKG6TE|4.0|I am a huge QOTSA fan and when I first got this album I was a little dissapointed that I had wasted 2 years waiting for a handful of good songs. I had Lullabyes to Paralyze in my car stereo playing non stop for three months when I first got it. i seemed to find less replay value with Era Vulgaris. But I listened to the album over and over again and I really started to dig it. The only thing I can say is pick up this album and decide for yourself. I see a lot of reviews sayin that 'Turnin' on the Screw' and 'Battery Acid' are horrible songs. I however, saw them as finer points of the album and I think it is great progression for QOTSA's new age sound. Even if you do hate those songs, I think you will be satisfied with 'sick, sick, sick', '3's & 7's' and 'River in the Road'. Do not expect the same music of the Rated R and Songs for the Deaf albums. Or for those of you like me who really enjoyed Lullabyes, don't expect that either. It's really music of it's own breed and if you give it a chance I think you will end up finding this album to be worth your while.
0316166685|5.0|What a great read!  The array of characters was so life-like and believable, even the dead Susie Salmon, that I feel like I could recognize them in real-life.  The major characters were given enough individual spotlight treatment throughout the story, which did not bog down the pacing.  Mr. Harvey, the murderer, is not just a flat, evil presence.  One gets to know enough about him also.    Try as I may not to cry, the waters flowed out of my eyes.  The subject matter is not for the faint-hearted, but Sebold does not exploit the gruesome details.  Her writing is tender and simple, as she gives voice to the teenaged Susie.    For Susie, arrested in development at 14 years horribly and unfairly by the sadistic Mr. Harvey, her version of heaven entails friendship with a girl her age and with a mother figure.  Sebold takes amazing risks in her vision of Susie's afterlife, especially at the near end of the story.  But the author's writing is so effortless and unpretentious that I just go along with it all in stride.  Highest recommendations.
B00000K0EA|5.0|Ok, so I love a lot of Bond films, but this one is at the very top of my list with \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" and \\"The World is Not Enough.\\" The acting is great, the action is better than most any Bond film, (excluding Casino Royale, which blew my mind with it's high impact chases and fights,) and the score by David Arnold is an instant classic.    This is Bond, James Bond at his absolute best. BUY IT!!
B000PFUA9G|5.0|But i saw this cd the other day and decided to try it out.  I'm really glad i did Mr. Paisley knows how to put it together on a cd.  With songs about cops and online which is actually one of my fav songs on here \\"online\\" it fits perfectly.  I dont know a whole lot about country music.  But i do know that i love the cd 5th Gear and am glad that i made the decision to pick it up.  I will have to look for more of his previous cds as well.  He's in 5th Gear on this cd and is sure to continue kicking it along for some time to come.
B000M53GM2|5.0|007, Goldeneye is magic in so many ways. First of all, the name is one of the best and most memorable in the series, making it entirely marketable in diverse ways. Second, the acting is stellar, incorporating many recognizable stars into one amazing Bond film. Thirdly, the electronic/lush romantic score by Eric Serra is wonderful. Fourth... Let's just say this is a great film.  PS  My only reservation in reccomending this film are a couple scenes that seem to blur the line between sensuality and violence, (the villianess is a murderer with the style of a black widow.)
B000E6ESL2|4.0|I liked it... I don't think it was a waste of time like a lot of people are reporting, but I also don't think it's a brilliant piece of art like others feel.  It was just a good, interesting movie.  The ending threw me off, and I was disappointed that nothing seemed to be solved.  But then I went on the IMDB message boards and watched the special documentary on near death experiences and everything was clearer to me.  I think you need to watch this movie more than once (the same goes for I Love Your Work--an utterly underrated, weird film as well) to really get it.  And I plan on doing just that =P
B000GX57YK|3.0|I love this movie, I had it on DVD and I got it on HD DVD recently. My only gripe is the quality of the video transfer. There is a lot of graining and artifact noise, especially on dark scenes. The blacks on the DVD version look better than the HD DVD version's blacks...
0930289234|5.0|After you read this you realize how powerful comics are. I picked this up because of the huge follwing it has, this is the first comic I've read where the heroes have real problems. Alan Moore writes like these events are truly happening and the characters are so fully thought out, the artwork is so detailed that you have to watch everything carefully. The end is amazing. I would tell everyone no matter who they are to pick this up.
B000002IGP|5.0|When one looks at 80s West Coast metal, the bands that usually come to mind are Guns N' Roses, Van Halen, Motley Crue and to a lesser degree Poison. And what of RATT? Many people may say, \\"oh yeah, I remember them. What ever happened to RATT\\"?<br /><br />What happened to RATT is that they sort of evolved backwards. Whereas Motley Crue, a peer of RATT, released a string of good albums throughout the 80s, reaching the top of the rock world by the decade's end with \\"Dr. Feelgood,\\" (1989) RATT sort of blew their wad early on. Because RATT ended their career (before a reunion) on such a low note with the mediocre \\"Reach for the Sky\\" (1988) and the horrific \\"Detonator,\\" (1990) it's easy to forget that when RATT started out, they were, no doubt, absolutely one of the best bands to emerge from the 80s sunset strip scene.<br /><br />\\"Out of the Cellar,\\" (1984) RATT's first album, following the \\"RATT\\" EP, (1983) saw the band reach its critical, commercial and artistic climax. While \\"Out of the Cellar\\" may not be the most ground-breaking album of all-time (it's sort of like a Van Halen--KISS--Judas Priest stew) the album sure did rock. Loaded with killer hooks, infectious sing-along-choruses, great guitar work (courtesy of virtuoso Warren DeMartini and Robin Crosby) and just really superb finely-crafted songs, \\"Out of the Cellar\\" is easily one of the greatest hard-rock releases of the 1980s.<br /><br />One of the things that makes \\"Out of the Cellar\\" so great is that the band sounds hungry, on fire--youthful. Singer Stephan Pearcy is by no means a great (or even good) singer, but his charisma and eagerness to rock compensated for his lack of vocal talent. Guitarists Warren DeMartini and Robin Crosby may not have been Eddie Van Halen or Steve Vai, but they were still pretty damn good--and their dual arsenal of killer hooks and solos were better than most of what their peers (like Motley Crue's Mick Mars) had to offer. The songs also have a real edge to them, so on \\"Out of the Cellar\\" RATT sounds as though they mean it, not like a bunch of poseurs going through the motions.<br /><br />While \\"Out of the Cellar\\" is known mostly for its massive hit \\"Round and Round\\" and to a lesser extent \\"Lack of Communication,\\" \\"Wanted Man\\" and \\"Back for More,\\" there really isn't any filler at all on this album. \\"Out of the Cellar\\" packs ten powerful punches, going straight for the jugular, not once ever losing momentum. Some of the band's more underrated songs like \\"I'm Insane\\" and the closing epic \\"Scene of the Crime\\" (which can be seen as a prelude to Motley's \\"You're all I Need\\") are easily as good as the hit singles.<br /><br />Although the first few follow-ups were pretty good, RATT unfortunately never matched the brilliance of their debut. Still, what a debut it was. If you are a fan of 80s rock/metal, \\"Out of the Cellar\\" is an essential album to own.though they mean it, not like a bunch of poseurs going through the motions.

B000AMJDHY|5.0|This has to be one of my favourite albums of recent years.    These guys have taken a lot of unfair criticism for their style but they are very smart about what they do - they know what is popular while still retaining their own distinct sound.    I love that synthesizers are making a come back. The synthesis of rock and electronica is done perfectly - I just wish they had kept their demos for the album too. They are more fun than the album versions are are more electronically influenced.    Perhaps I'm biased because I am primarily a fan of electronic music, but I really do think these guys have created the perfect blend. They don't overdo the electronic elements so people who are not too keen on that kind of sound won't have to hear it for long.    Again, brilliant album. We can only hope the sophomore effort exceeds their debut.
0143038419|5.0|Like other reviewers, I could not put this one down.  The author has a great ability to write relatable, honest, witty prose that makes you feel like you're right there with her the whole time.  I still laugh when I think of her description of early attempts to try to meditate because my mind does the exact same thing!  As a thirty-something who's spent a lot of time in Italy and would love to see India and Bali, it was so wonderful to experience these two phases through such friendly (and once again \\"relatable\\") eyes.  The only minor faults of the book are that India began to get a little long.  And the ending left me wishing she was able to wrap up her happy ending in a neat little bow though I know that the reality is that she doesn't have an ending yet.  I've recommended this book to all my thirty-something girl friends.  Even the ones who have the marriage/family thing going on have told me how much of the book they could relate to.  And I recommend this book to you too.
0385522401|1.0|This book is not a novel at barely 200 pages long.  I was uninterested in the characters and the silly plot. I was disturbed by McEwan's repetitive use (or, as I feel, misuse) of the word \\"nauseous.\\" The worst line in the book being on page 121, \\"He was nauseous with desire and indecision.\\"  Ugh, awful writing.  I like Ian McEwan, and am a fan of his unusual plots and great character driven stories, but this book was downright painful to read.  After incredible books like Atonement, Saturday and Enduring Love, this one is just plain bad.  Poor Florence, she is treated very poorly by both her new husband and Ian McEwan; he is totally unsynmpathetic towards her.  I, too, am in the majority of not liking this book, but it just doesn't compare with his other works, at all.  Don't be \\"nauseated\\" by reading this book and wasting time that could be spent on another much better novel.  Read Abundance (Sena Jeter Naslund)  if you want to read about a real dysfunctional marriage!  Louis and Marie worked a heck of a lot harder than these two!  Very disappointing.
B00008MJ8H|5.0|For more than twenty years now, I've been listening to this haunting music and it has never dulled. Revisiting it now, in my forties, I find it  overwhelmingly sad....tracks #2 \\"Poverty\\" and #3 \\"Deborah's Theme\\" crystallize what I think is the theme of the movie: how a group of young people coming of age just when the country itself is coming into its own can, like the leadership of the country, make choices that impact the rest of their lives. Can they....can the country...find redemption? Like great fiction, and, many would say, like the movie, it has different meanings as you listen to it at different stages in your own life. I call that music for the ages. This one will be regarding as a classic long after my generation has left the earth.
0385522401|1.0|I'm a great fan of Mr.McEwan. I thought his novel \\"Saturday\\" was superb, an allegory for our time. However, in his newest novel he must have wanted to cash in on his famous literary name and make a fast buck, that's how slipshod On \\"Chesil Beach\\" is. Clearly its cardboard characters and slick facile philosophy was dashed off. Two pre-sixties sexual revolution characters meet, marry, encounter a moment of sexual difficulty on their wedding night and part. That's the plot. At the end the author dashes off 30 years of history of the male of the novel in about two pages, giving his point of view of the moment when he and his wife of a few hours parted company. The lady's point of view is totally ignored. \\"This is how the entire course of a life can be changed - by doing nothing\\", the author tells us. If Edward had run after Florence things would have been different. But would it? What would have been more courageous and more interesting from the novelist's and reader's point of view would have been to stay with these two characters and seen how life worked out for them. A very disappointing novel.
B0007TKNIS|4.0|PROS: For those of you that love the play, this is a great way to enjoy it from home. Emmy Rossum provides a great performance as a very credible Christine Daae.    CONS: It's hard to believe that there was no one better than Gerard Butler to play the Phantom. He just can't sing to save his life. Raoul is also very regrettable.
1594489505|5.0|Review: A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini<br /><br />I am not sure why the book is called A Thousand Splendid Suns. But, it doesn't matter, really. It's a beautiful story, and been eagerly awaited since the authors first book The Kite Runner, published in 2003, became a runaway success.  Hosseini was born in Afghanistan, and like millions of Afghans, left his country during the very long period of foreign occupation and internal strife.  His father was a diplomat, and his family moved to France and then the US.  Trained as a medical doctor, Hosseini is now a full time writer, living and working in California.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is a magnificent story spanning three generations of women and men.  Its protagonists are two women - Miriam and Laila - who are a generation apart. Their fates come together as they are married to the same man B Rasheed B whose first wife and child have died. Miriam is a harami or a child born out of wedlock.  Her mother was a maid; her father the man she mother worked for, who had three wives, and multiple children.  Her mother was banished to a distant hut, outside the northern city of Herat, where Miriam was raised by her mother. Her father came to see her on Thursdays.  At the age of 15, Miriam runs away to her fathers' house, only to be rudely turned way; her mother hangs herself.  Miriam=s life changes in ways she could not have imagined.  Her father and wives arrange her marriage to the 40 year old Rasheed.<br /><br />Miriam moves to Kabul where Rasheed owns a leather shop.  Her life is sad and lonely. She has a miscarriage, and after that, no living children.  In a society where children - especially male - are so desired - Miriam becomes a living ghost in her home. Meanwhile, on their street are two families whose children, Laila and Tariq - unlike Miriam - are loved and wanted, cherished and desired.  And, with and through them, Miriam changes her life.  Laila, in a series of mishaps ends up in their home and becomes Rasheed=s new wife (she is pregnant with Tariq=s child).  It takes a while for Miriam and Laila, joined as they are in their mutual dislike for Rasheed, to develop a bond.  So much so, Miriam while trying to save Laila=s life kills Rasheed.  For this, she is sentenced to death.<br /><br />Through the Soviet occupation, the Mujahedeen, the Taliban, everyones life is thrown in disarray. Lives are lost; men, women and children despair and no one can make sense of anything.  A certain kind of de-humanization takes place B people have nowhere to turn to and nowhere to go.  They cry, silently and loudly and often lose themselves, and their minds.<br />Through the trials and tribulations of loves and lives lost and gained, Hosseini weaves a magnificent tale.  His descriptions of people, the landscape, and the state of mind of the characters is rich and pertinent.  His prose is precise.  His humanity is complete. His descriptions are tender and accurate.<br /><br />The strength of Hosseinis' writing is his understanding of the world and people he left behind, as well as the world and people he went to.<br /><br />As I read the book, I felt I was in Afghanistan. I read The Kite Runner before my first trip to Afghanistan in 2004.  It enabled me to picture Afghanistan in a way no other book did.  Now, after my second trip to Afghanistan in 2006, A Thousand Splendid Suns takes on greater meaning.  I walked in the markets Miriam and Laila walked.  I know the streets Hosseini writes about, and the rituals he describes.  I also witnessed the generosity and love of Afghans first hand. I too heard their stories and many match Hosseinis=.<br /><br />Like the Kite Runner, A Thousand Splendid Suns comes full circle. Laila, Tariq and their children, who left Afghanistan for Pakistan during the Taliban regime, return.  They want to contribute to the new Afghanistan.  Like The Kite Runner, in this book, love triumphs over everything else B betrayal, jealousy, hatred, misfortune, and many more negative emotions.<br /><br />In the end, and in the book, it is love and hope that triumphs over death and destruction.  This is the central message of the book. If you want to understand the nature of relationships in Afghanistan, the book is a must.  It is historical, it is contemporary, it is sad, it is happy.  Most of all, it is written from the heart.nd in the book, it is love and hope that triumphs over death and destruction.  This is the central message of the book.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Whether anybody has noticed that Rihanna has lived past her days of inconsistent albums is a mystery but what I do know is that everybody will be blasting this album for a long time. My first encounter with her music was last summer with A Girl Like Me which had its good and bad but Good Girl Gone Bad finally comes correct. She finally let go of the cliche Carribean production and somewhat crossed over into straight pop which is great because that got kind of annoying on her debut and sophomore efforts. The first 5 tracks should be singles because they are dance perfection to my ears that they make a person want to really do some hardcore moving. \\"Shut Up and Drive\\" is hot but it has it's moments. \\"Say It\\" is the only track that rings filler to me on the album because it just sucks. Everything after \\"Say It\\" is great. Although there is one teeny flaw I have with \\"Question Exisiting\\" sounding a bit like \\"Let It Will Be\\" from Madonna's last album. It's not the music at all but the self conscious message about being a star/entertainer. Overall I give Rihanna her props for finally getting her music formula correct and not sounding a mess although she could benefit from a few voice lessons. So go ahead and buy this pop gem that you will not regret...
1400063515|3.0|An interesting but somewhat obvious thesis: highly improbable events with a large impact play a large role in the world; because of this the future is impossible to predict (the 1987 stock market crash, the fall of the USSR, the rise of the internet, etc).  NNT (as he refers to himself) provides a lot of interesting examples and shows clearly how 'risk management' is generally a fraud.      <br />  <br />He attacks economics and economists for their heavy reliance on mathematical techniques that bear little resemblance to reality.  He nicely shows the ridiculous assumptions made by economists, giving an example of a Nobel laureate whose model didn't match the facts.  But since the model used elegant mathematics, he received the Nobel.  <br />  <br />However, too often he says it's relatively straightforward to prove blah blah blah, but then doesn't.  We're supposed to take it on faith that he's got some proof for his claim.  Also, he annoyingly talks about how much smarter he is than everyone else, disparaging everyone he can think of.  NNT's ego gets in the way of much of the book.  This windbag could have written a 100 page book just as effectively, but clearly likes to hear himself write being so impressed with himself.
B0000042MY|5.0|Why is he writing reviews? Please Mr.McCulley stop. People this music was probably the first soundtrack, that made me sit up and listen and understand how much the music behind the movie actually drives the emotions that cannot be conveyed.   The music also can stand alone by itself. I cant name favorites. But this is one piece of art thats universally loved by everybody. Get it, you never will regret it.
0316067598|5.0|The book is a good read, some segments, are a little repeditive, but when finnished you realize they are that way for a reason, and they illustrate that there is no cutting corners to be an elite warrior, like a SEAL.<br />The book reminds me in some way of Black Hawk down, and it takes me back to Mogadishu, where I had the fortune of working together with som of the Navy SEALS that was stationed there.<br /><br />I can already see this book made into a movie, the story about these brave men needs to be spread and this book does them honor for their ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />God bless you Luttrell and God bless your fallen comrades, and all who serves our beloved country.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|It's no accident that the whole Celestine Adventure gets rolling for protagonist John Woodson after he receives news he's being laid off from his high school teaching position due to faculty budget cuts. Indeed, the primary premise of the Celestine Prophecy, both the book and the movie, is that we are all being called to \\"open up\\" to the Larger Reality of life, but to do this we first have to \\"let go\\" of our material preoccupations in order to experience the ultimate spiritual truth of existence.         It's also no accident that the film came out when it did, in 2006, and that in 2007 the American economy begins its terminal downtrend toward complete systemic collapse. Synchronicity you say? Well of course! We are now about to live the Insights from start to finish (or something quite similar) on a collective scale. But there isn't much time left. In fact, if you follow the Mayan Calendar, you know 2012 is the year when \\"time\\" runs out!  All this simply confirms the film's main premise: that we aren't in control of our lives as we thought we were, but that Something else most assuredly is, and is moving us toward some kind of Divine Consummation in very short order, provided we stay awake and \\"in the flow\\" of things.        Think it's an accident that you came to this site and read this review? Think again! Better yet, go beyond thinking altogether and get the movie. It's no accident, I assure you..:-)
B00005JPDP|4.0|Perfume-The Story of a Murderer brings to the screen the tale of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, a young man with an unprecedented sense of smell, which allows him to do extraordinary feats such as break down the contents of a perfume simply by one whiff.  Things take a turn to the darker side when he decides to create the perfect perfume made of the scent of young women...  The movie follows a pragmatic and realistic account of conditions in 18th Century pre-revolutionary France.  The film brings to the screen two main stories, which are unfolding simultaneously: On the one hand, Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, and his life dream of creating the perfect perfume, and on the other (and to a lesser extent), conditions leading to the French Revolution (1789).    The movie portrays superbly life in France, and provides valuable insight into a very important period of French (European) History.  We get a feel for the power and influence that the Catholic Church exerts during this time.  The film is also excellent in showing the Ancien Regime's methods of execution (Hanging and \\"The Cross\\") as opposed to the \\"revolutionary\\" guillotine used after 1789.  Ben Whishaw, Dustin Hoffman, Alan Rickman (!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows.     The setting, the dialogues, the music, and the costumes are all wonderful!  Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a thought-provoking movie that will provide for an evening's entertainment.  Strongly recommended along with Napoleon the TV Miniseries (starring Christian Clavier, Isabella Rossellini, Gerard Depardieu, and John Malkovich), Queen Margot (Isabelle Adjani), Brotherhood of the Wolf (Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel), and Vidocq (Gerard Depardieu) for those with a soft spot for France and/or French History.
B000050XEI|3.0|Now don't get me wrong -- I am an Enya fan. And as such I was looking forward to the release of the CD.    I probably listen to it the least of any of her CD's that I own (for the record, I have \\"Shepherd Moons,\\" \\"Watermark,\\" \\"The Memory of Trees,\\" \\"The Celts,\\" \\"Paint the Sky with Stars,\\" and \\"Amarantine\\").    Why? Because with each previous (and subsequent) Enya release, there has been something that goes beyond the ethereal tones that we expect from her. And I just don't hear it here.    I do have my favourites on the CD just like anyone else (\\"Flora's Secret\\" and \\"Lazy Days\\"), but I wouldn't say that they stand out in any significant way from tracks on other CD's. If you have to choose one disc among Enya's later works, pick up Amarantine first, then grab this one later if you want a complete tome.
B000MTOSK2|5.0|metallians this was the first true masterpiece by kamelot, the other cds are great but when this came out it blew all their others away, i thought epica was good but not half as good as this and no where near as good as the black halo. this cd has some insanely catchy sing along choruses and some of the best riffs you will ever hear. the song wings of despair is amazing and sucks you in from the beginning to end. they took their synth and keyboards alot more serious here and it makes this albums sound stand out so much. the music is top knotch power metal perfection and like the black halo you can listen to this album from beginning to end and never get bored. the music can be heavy and full of crunchy power chords at times and at times a faint beautiful females vocals appear and the keyboards blend so great with this. it takes you to a beautiful seductive place one minute and straight to the torments of hell the next.that is also why this cd is so great and what makes it stand out. it has a dark side and a sensual seductive emotional side and it all blends together to create some of the most timeless power metal songs you will ever hear. this cd and the black halo deserve a spot in every true metallians collection. kamelot are without question one of the most talented and diverse power metal bands around today and the future is looking bright for these metallians, your brother in metal brandon whitson, 25 of north carolina
B0000CEB4V|3.0|I liked the concert; however, I must be compeltely honest - it is hard for me to sit through the entire dvd and pay attention and I am HUGE fan of George!
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I have this movie on regular DVD and the quality far exceeds the Blu-ray version. As another reviewer wrote, I have so much noise and a line through the center of the screen, that the movie is not watchable. These things should be recalled.
0743496728|4.0|With the recent events of Virginia Tech still fresh in America's minds, and also happening at roughly the same time as this book was launched, Jodi Picoult's latest offering could easily turn out to be a hit or a miss. I grabbed it as soon as it came out in the UK, and managed not to pick it up until I went on holiday - along with nine other books!<br /><br />It was also the first book I read on holiday, and it really kicked it off. It's excellent holiday fodder, and it's perfectly easy to get completely lost in the story. With recent books, Jodi does seem to be getting a lot repetitive - the court cases etc. But the last two books I've read of hers (this and The Tenth Circle, also a holiday book) seem to almost completely gloss over the court case, and don't go into as much detail.<br /><br />It's a very difficult subject to read about, with Columbine, Virginia Tech, and a few others which probably haven't appeared in the press as much. Jodi does her usual, of showing what's happening in the present, before presenting what happened in the past, and then expertly tying up the loose ends at the end of the book.<br /><br />It can prove to be quite a convoluted story, and previous reviewers have mentioned not being able to differentiate between characters, which I do agree with, but I also insist people stick with it. There's not that many characters you need to keep in your head, it is mainly Peter & Josie's story. And it does prove to be very interesting. I won't go into lots of detail, but I loved the title - the book starts off with what you can do in nineteen minutes. And it will get you thinking of what else you can do - some involving your other half! Hehe. It's an attention grabbing start to the book.<br /><br />I think Jodi hit the nail on the head this time, with how a high school shooting affected a whole community, delving deep into fictional characters minds. I applaud her for an excellent book. And look forward to her next work.
0804106304|4.0|I read this book a little over a year ago for my ap english 2 class. I really<br />liked how it displayed the Chinese culture and values. It is basically a book of mother-daughter relationships. There are four mothers and four daughters. The mothers are Chinese women who immigrated in the United States. The daughters are Chinese-American. It shows how people (like those in the United<br />States) tend to take their heritage for granted and just label themselves as Americans. When in reality your heritage will always be there and when you finally except wonderful relationships and things can come out of it.<br /><br />thank you for your time,<br />Loran

0385340559|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher novel - tough, smart and easy to read.Highly recommended!<br />One technicality that bothered me is that Reacher tells a helicopter pilot that helicopters survive descents better from lower rather than higher altitudes.<br />My instructors always told me \\"altitude is your friend\\". Helicopter pilots constantly practice engine off descents (called \\"autos\\")in which the rotors are allowed to \\"free wheel\\" using gravity and the air rushing up from below to keep them turning as fast as possible in the descent so that just before reaching the ground the pitch can be adjusted to produce a \\"soft\\" landing. Believe me, it works. Trying to do an \\"auto\\" from anything less than a thousand feet is much more dangerous because the rotors don't have enough time to work up sufficient speed.<br />It's a small triumph to catch Lee Child on a tecnnicality....
B000MCIBB6|5.0|When this album was released in the late 60's, I bought the vinyl album and noticed that the liner notes had the entire version of \\"The Celebration of the Lizard). The only part of this that appeared on the album was \\"Not to touch the Earth\\"   Not to Touch the Earth is probably the best part of the song, but its only part of it.  I remember being disappointed that the song was not long like, The End or When the Music's over were on their previous two releases.  FINALLY after 40 years they have released a studio version of the entire song.  Waiting for the Sun and their first album simply entitled the Doors are in my mind their best releases. Both albums are raw and are less commercial.  Some of the later releases such as Soft Parade and Morrison Hotel are either not as good or are too commerical. A few songs on Soft Parade even have horns and other things that make the recordings too \\"Refined\\"  Jim Morrison is reciting his poetry, and it is probably his first album where he does so.  For hard core Doors fans like myself this is a must. For casual listeners or new listeners, I dont know what to tell you.   For me the recording is now complete and Doors fans like myself can now hear this CD in its entirety.............Enjoy
B000NVIXFK|3.0|I'm not going to compare this album to previous ones.  I've been a fan for 30 years, the band has changed alot in that time and so have I.  We've grown together.    A related question I would ask is, if I were new to the band, would I identify this album as an introduction that would make me want to buy more of their recordings?  In the end I cannot honestly say that I would.  Today there is competition from talented musicians from all over the world and I don't feel the music on this album is either innovative or memorable compared to what else is out there.    The music has become too \\"comfortable\\".  If I had to offer some constructive cricitism perhaps the best I can do is to say \\"shake things up!\\"  It was you who told us that change is constant yet the same old tendencies keep cropping up in your music.  After extensive listening only six of the thirteen songs have even made it to my current playlist and those are ones where I feel the band has made an effort to branch out from what they normally do.  The band's arrangements have become very predictable.  Here's a simple idea for Geddy - vary the number of bars at the start of songs; how often have you heard him start singing on the first or second bar of a song, for example?  Vary the strong structure by singing only the chorus or by placing an acoustic section at the end instead of the beginning, etc.  Let Geddy or Alex write the lyrics for one song!  Use the new instruments to effect - for goodness sakes Alex, you had a bouzouki on this album - tap into some of your Balkan heritage, for instance, to make a cool riff that just wouldn't work on a guitar.  If all these experiments fail, it shouldn't be out of the question to seek collaboration on the next Rush album with other musicians you enjoy to force yourselves out of the comfort zone.

1565847032|4.0|I've read many Noam Chomsky books and this one is pretty good. Its just a assorted set of lectures and talks he has given. While his ability to be aware of so many facts about foreign policy is amazing his actual understanding can be sometimes limited. One example is when He talks of Nixon's fall from power and points out that Nixon did worse things then watergate. He mentions the bombing of cambodia which killed in his estimate about 150,000 people. The problem of course is that it is laughable that any president would be impeached for killing people in a war, even if it is a war crime. Noam Chomsky is brilliant but his idealism often obstructs an otherwise clear view of the world.
0316067598|5.0|This story is absolutely amazing. I have followed the details of Red Wing as close as I could given the limited amount of information released, and this book really opens up and lays it all out for us. The heroism of these four men should never go unnoticed and the country is lucky to have such fine, dedicated warriors.    I do, however, have to join in the chorus of the negative reviewers in some aspects. I did find myself rolling my eyes everytime Luttrell mentioned \\"liberals\\" on several pages in a row. While I don't classify myself as a liberal, it really became ridiculous after the first few uses of it. You can rationalize it every possible way, but killing those goatherders would have been murder. That said, as much as I can relate sitting here in a cushy seat at home, I would have to say I would have executed them given the situation. As far as Luttrell having an \\"ego\\" as someone stated, yes he does. If yo know people from the SF community, like I do, you'll soon find that extreme confidence and sometimes comical arrogance is in no short supply. That's how these guys are trained, and they've earned it.    Overall, top notch book. I wish Marcus Luttrell well and hope his physical and mental wounds heal in time.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|If you are a Who fan, you HAVE TO own this. The is a great rockumentary! Definitely one of my favorites, along with the Zeppelin one! I could watch this over and over. It shows their best performances and their personalities.  Don't miss out on some classic Keith Moon!
B00005NB0H|5.0|The Who were are great live band. In the period from roughly 1968-1972, this great live band were at the very height of their abilities. Individually, Daltrey, Townshend, Entwistle, and Moon were tremendous, dynamic, and innovative forces on their respective instruments. When focused together in a live environment, as these discs show, they were nothing short of mind-alteringly breathtaking.    Live at Leeds consists of brilliant pop/rock songs and extended hard-rock pieces executed with devastating precision and power. The improvised sections in some of the lengthened songs add to, rather than detract from, their impact. The musical and dynamic interaction between the players is tremendous, bordering on magical, and demonstrates why The Who live were so powerful and exciting. This disc is well recorded with none of the usual live album nonsense: no unnecessary production tricks or fancy mixing theatrics, no goofy special effects, no faked-up crowd over-enthusiasm, or other foolishness; direct and down-to-business, much like the band themselves were at this time.     The recent digital remastering and restoration only adds to the sonic clarity. The added tracks of the Deluxe edition add another top-notch live version of Tommy, sharper than that from the Isle of Wight album, as well as some additional typical Who concert staples of the period. Further, the inclusion of between song banter among the band members and sonic snapshots of the band talking with the audience are an added treat. In short, the expansion of this album gives one a better feel what a full Who concert performance was like during this exciting period, yet still does not detract from its overall undeniable momentum.     Simply put, the best live rock album ever made. Period.
B000BTGY1O|1.0|THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST!!!  at being terrible!<br /><br />This movie is, frankly, one of the most uninteresting, and utterly boring movies I have ever seen. Seriously, this movie makes reruns of c-span seem as exciting as \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\". This movie does not even begin to have what could be loosely described as a plot. Instead it focuses on the uninteresting life of a woman who calls herself \\"Holly\\". It focuses on various occurrences in her life, primarily on her love interests (which are contingent entirely on money). However the man that falls in love with her seems not to care, lending to one extremely stupid seeming character. When Hepburn throws her cat out of a cab into the rain, it left me wondering why he didn't do the same to Hepburn. Her character is so unlikeable it's nearly impossible to describe. At one point she states \\"lets each do something we haven't done before\\", then states \\"but I couldn't think of anything I haven't done before\\". At this point, I couldn't contain myself anymore. I yelled at the screen \\"How about something interesting to watch! Neither of you have done that before!\\"<br /><br />All in all, the lack of a plot, unlikeable characters, and mediocre scripting lead to an outright dull and uninteresting movie. There should be a warning on the box that says \\"hide all sharp objects before attempting to view this movie\\" because chances are, you will be stabbing yourself in the eyes before you've finished this one. Whoever decided this movie was a classic should be shot!
0345308239|5.0|Barbara Tuchman wrote this book to illustrate some of the worst examples of leadership throughout history.  She retells the mythical story of Trojan defeat, Papal life that spawned the Reformation, British obtuseness that lost America and the U.S. experience in Vietnam.  Although casual readers of history have heard these tales before, Tuchman's version is original and trenchant with a touch of weary sarcasm.     The origins of the Reformation are usually told from  Luther's viewpoint, but Tuchman sketches the Popes' lifestyles and family conections from 1470-1530. It was an era when civil and religious warlords were so drawn to the demonstration of opulence and power that the Popes could no more represent Christ's message than mafia dons. Michaelangelo asked Julius II if he should be painted with a book in hand. \\"Put a sword there,\\" he replied.  \\"I know nothing of letters.\\"    Most Americans have heard the improbable success-story of the Revolution, but Tuchman relates the story from Parliament where the British ruling class exerted their perogatives.  America was only a newspaper item to the titled Brits- not one in position of authority ever set foot here- unless he commanded an army. This peek at Royal Britain goes a long way to explain why they were so determined to bend America to their laws and interests. Of course there were distinguished Cassandras among them- Pitt, Burke, Barre and others- But, all were ignored.    America became the fool in the 20th century when she tried to prop up a corrupt and incompetent faction in South Vietnam.  I was surprised to to read that all Presidents involved had plenty of warning about the tenacity of the North, the ineffectiveness of our bombing, the futility of \\"Vietnamization, the ultimate harm we were doing to our country... Somehow we inveigled leaders who would lie and misrepresent only to dig a deeper hole. They persisted to \\"work the levers\\" even when they knew it was a lost cause.    If Ms. Tuchman were alive and able to update this work, Junior Bush's war would provide the perfect fodder. His war fits so many descriptives that could be applied to previous follies.  And yet, the millions of Americans who remembered Vietnam  and saw the similarities with Iraq were unable to stop it. I'll close with a quote from Tuchman that is about Vietnam, but is relevant to many ill-conceived conflicts:  \\"The follies...begin with continuous over-reacting: in the invention of endangered 'national security,' the invention of 'vital interest,' the invention of a 'commitment' which rapidly assumed a life of its own, casting a spell over the inventor.\\"
B00005NTJM|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />1968 saw the first release from Jethro Tull and Mick Abrahams (Guitar) only year with the band.

They took a path of adventure mixing the diversity of blues, folk, rock, and even a legendary jazz piece!<br /><br />\\"My Sunday Feeling\\" is the blues through and through but Tull puts their own personal sound and feel to the recording.<br /><br />\\"Serenade To A Cuckoo\\" is well known jazz tune by Rahsaan Roland Kirk.  Tull's rendition flows so easily they could pass it off as an Ian Anderson original.<br /><br />This is the chance to check out the original recording of \\"Dharma For One\\" that turned a bunch of heads on the \\"Living In the Past\\" LP.<br /><br />\\"Cat's Squirrel\\" is nothing short of superb.  It is the traditional blues song that Cream would highlight so well.  Abrahams effort gained him a high level of respect from the Clapton crowd.<br /><br />\\"A Song For Jeffrey\\" is hard to categorize.  It is esoteric and accessible at the same time.  For many years, this tune received FM rock airplay.<br /><br />With the addition of four bonus tracks (Two being terrific \\"Love Story\\" and \\"Christmas Song\\") there are even more outstanding tracks to enjoy.<br /><br />Surprisingly on the remaster with the bonus cuts, the mix isn't always as optimum as it should be.  \\"A Song For Jeffrey\\" is an example of a track that should have had the vocals brought up.  One negative doesn't outweigh a chance to see how it was in 68.<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"sn't outweigh a chance to see how it was in 68.

B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Thinking about high school, it's odd that no \\"high school noir\\" films existed prior to the last few years.  High school is such a perfect setting for a film noir, and though it may seem ridiculous at first, there's many parallels between the world of a teenager and a character in a 1940s noir, be it the battle between the police and the shamuses and the battle between the administrators and the students or the shady meetings under bridges and the shady meetings in the parking lot after school.  In 2004, Rob Thomas' Chandler-esque take on high school hit UPN (and later the CW) as \\"[[ASIN:B000A59PMO Veronica Mars]],\\" and one year later, \\"Brick\\" premiered at Sundance.    While \\"Veronica Mars\\" is on the lighter side of noir, \\"Brick\\" is a pitch black, gritty piece which recalls Howard Hawks' \\"[[ASIN:B000FFJYA2 The Big Sleep]],\\" with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  The resemblance isn't in the style of director Rian Johnson (which bears a striking similarity to that used by David Lynch in one of his own neo-noir's, 1992's \\"[[ASIN:B000056BP1 Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me]]\\"), but in the convoluted script, the conspicuous characters, and particularly the rapidfire, hard-boiled dialogue, delivered at a startling pace by a talented young cast.  This includes Joseph Gordon-Levitt, best known as the youngest alien explorer from \\"[[ASIN:B0007WQGVI 3rd Rock from the Sun]],\\" along with Emilie de Ravin of \\"[[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]],\\" Lukas Haas, Noah Fleiss, and Richard Roundtree, the original \\"[[ASIN:0790743752 Shaft]].\\"  Gordon-Levitt's role is a far cry from his work on \\"Third Rock.\\"  He's cool, quick-witted, and tough, something of a much more contemptuous Sam Spade.  Gordon-Levitt is truly excellent, and he shows real promise should he be cast in the right roles.  Haas and Fleiss both play their roles quite well, but it's Meagan Good as a scheming drama queen (literally) who commands the most attention.    The film's plot, even at its barest, is quite clearly shaped in thenoir mold: Gordon-Levitt's character, a high school student who keeps himself distanced from his classmates, thrusts himself into the cliques in an effort to find out who murdered his ex-girlfriend.  His search leads him to the Pin (Haas), a 26-year-old drug kingpin.  In one of the film's most memorable scenes, Gordon-Levitt meets with the Pin and his henchman in the kitchen, while the Pin's mother serves them breakfast and apple juice before kissing him goodbye.  It's the one scene in \\"Brick\\" where writer/director Johnson acknowledges that all our characters are kids, and that the film itself revolves around high school, despite its utterly somber tone.    The rest of the movie is so relentlessly straight-faced and serious that you almost forget it's a film noir about high school.  It's classic noir, though.  The protagonist loner with a rocky exterior and a noble interior, looking to do the right thing; the suspicious, all-powerful, ominous villain, usually an obsese fifty-year-old businessman but in this case a twenty-something drug dealer living in his basement; the femme fatale, a beautiful seductress with a hidden agenda; even the flirtatious and manipulative female who usually is an actress or waitress or secretary, or something along those lines, but who here is the lead actress in the high school drama club.  Much of the film's charm comes from consideration of its many allegories to \\"adult\\" noir tales.    The execution of this sort of idea matters so much, because, after all, what is a film noir if not cinema at its most stylish?  Johnson is well aware of this, though.  It shows not only in the maturity and seasoned approach of his directing, but also in the stimulating photography and, especially, in the stunning editing.  It comes as no surprise that the editing, also by Johnson, is so good, since Johnson began his career editing his short film \\"Evil Demon Goofball from Hell!!!\\" and then Lucky McKee's popular \\"May.\\"  \\"Brick\\" would make an excellent sample film to show young editors, since Johnson - at 29, a young editor himself - has done such a spectacular job, fashioning a seamless flow of jump cuts, point-of-view shots, distorted lenses, and exposed film.  Supporting this is an inventive, unorthodox score by Nathan Johnson, comprised of some sort of naiive bells and the woeful trumpet which Jerry Goldsmith used in his music for \\"Chinatown\\" and \\"L.A. Confidential.\\"    It's a pity that \\"Brick\\" didn't get more notice.  It was unquestionably one of the best films of 2005.  I'd even go so far as to call it one of the top films I've ever seen.  Viewed as a film from an experienced director, it's a stellar film, but when viewed as Johnson's debut, it's a fantastic achievement.  Fortunately, Johnson seems to have received the attention he deserved from this film: his next project stars big-name actors like Rachel Weisz and Adrien Brody.  I really hope Gordon-Levitt gets some decent roles, because he proves his acting prowess here.  It's films with the originality and effort of \\"Brick\\" that keep the industry going, and if you haven't seen it, don't hesitate to leap up and hunt for it like Sam Spade for the maltese falcon.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|Brandi Carlile is well on her way to becoming a legend. She brings a fresh, new spirit to the world of rock/country/folk. I am lucky to have been around to see her live, because I think years from now people will look back and see her as an icon. My only wish is that in her next video they show her natural side, I think the Story makes her look a bit old and the brows are way too plucked and too much unnatural looking makeup. She is a fresh, young, northwest beauty and I would like to see that, rather than what the industry thinks is best! Get a different stylist girl!!!
B000KCHZK6|4.0|At first I agreed with C. Luna's review that this album was boring.  And I was going to write that.  But I figured, what the hell, give it another listen, and now I completely disagree.  While melodically it is not as great as her first album, \\"Come Away With Me\\" (which I gave 5 stars), lyrically it surpasses that one.    For instance, listen to \\"Sinkin' Soon.\\"  She writes/sings:    \\"We drifted from the shore,  With a captain who's too proud to say,  That he dropped the oar\\"    \\"On Election Day.\\"  She writes/sings:    \\"We believed in our candidate,  But even more it's the one we hate,  I needed someone I could shake,  On election day.    But the day after is darker,  And deeper and deeper we go,  Who knows, maybe it's all a dream,  Who knows if I'll wake up and scream.\\"    Today, is June 23, 2007, after it was announced 8 of our American soldiers were killed in Iraq.  Yesterday ,15 were killed. I suddenly realized what great Protest Songs she was writing.  (Heck, I remember the '60s when they were rampant!)    She eloquently sings about our failed president, and his delusional arrogance.  I suddenly got it!    I bought the Dixie Chicks album because they had the balls to tell it like it is.  I bought this album simply because I liked Jones' previous work.  Now my respect for her is immense.     I only wish the melodies were stronger.  Still, what an exacllent collection of songs -- lyrically -- these are.
B00000IQW3|4.0|Alex Rogan (Lance Guest, \\"Halloween II\\" and \\"Jaws: The Revenge\\") seems to have a dead-end life.  He lives in a trailer park and helps keep things in the trailer park running.  His life is not his own.  The only fun he has is playing a video game, which he is very good playing.  One day Alex achieves the high score on the video game and life changes.<br /><br />A bizarre individual by the name of Centauri (played by the late, great Robert Preston) appears, looking for Alex.  Centauri is an agent for the Star League, recruiting potential Starfighters.  Centauri's tool for discovering the potential to be a Starfighter is the video game.<br /><br />Though Alex has longed to escape the trailer park, he struggles with the opportunity to be a Starfighter.  Alex thinks of his girlfriend Maggie (lovely Catherine Mary Stewart), his mother and the people he has helped in the trailer park.  Eventually Alex realizes that his life has already changed and that sometimes a little risk can yield great gains.  Alex heads back to Rylos and the Star League with Centauri, only to discover that he is the last Starfighter.  The end of this movie is all fun and excitement.<br /><br />This movie was released the year after \\"Return of the Jedi.\\"  The Star Wars movies were very serious and contained a lot of depth.  This movie avoided the angst of Star Wars and focused on the fun of shooting evil aliens.  This movie is a video game with a plot surrounding it.  This movie contained significant computer generated affects that helped the movie a lot, and those special effects increased the video game feeling of this movie.<br /><br />Though this movie relies a lot on special effects, the acting is generally quite good.  Robert Preston is awesome as Centauri, and I recommend this movie highly to Robert Preston fans.  Lance Guest, Catherine Mary Stewart and the late Dan O'Herlihy as the lizard-like alien Grig are also fun to watch.<br /><br />There are many kinds of science fiction movies.  This movie is fun in the tradition of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon.  There are spies and evil aliens.  There are spaceships that twist and turn and it is clear to the audience that Rylos is worth fighting for.  Lance Guest makes a lovable protagonist.

B000KCHZK6|4.0|On first hearing this CD, I was disappointed, it just seemed kind of blah and melancholy after her previous Feels Like Home.  But it got better with repeated playing.  My favorites off the bat were Wake Me Up, Rosie's Lullaby, and Not Too Late, they all have easily remembered refrains that stick in the mind.  But some of the others, if listened to carefully (that and reading the lyrics, since I have a difficult time hearing all of the words...a problem with modern artists, don't have that problem with Ella Fitzgerald, but I digress!) are interesting or have their own appeal.  Like Broken, whimsical and sweet, is she talking about a toy marionette, or a homeless person?  Not My Friend, is haunting and beautiful, and ends on an assertive but uneasy note, a touch of menace at the end.  My Dear Country seems like a bit of a johnny-come-lately, now that even the Republicans are having reservations about Iraq, it doesn't seem courageous for Jones to come out with it now, more of a safe bet.  I did like the use of the tuba in that one since my son plays one and rarely is this instrument used in popular music.  Little Room is cute and a little naughty, I can see this one especially appealing to men.  Sinkin' Soon has a distinctive ragtime feel that makes it stand out from the others melodically.  In conclusion, I will probably buy this CD, after repeated listening to my library's copy.
038073186X|5.0|Dennis Lehane's \\"Shutter Island\\" is quite different from his \\" Mystic River\\". It's a bit pulpier in the writing style and more fantastic in regards to the plot... but it's no less riveting. In the end, Lehane infuses his flawed characters with such humanity and he writes with such verve... that  this thriller achieves a sort of high art status.<br /><br />It is about a Mr. Teddy Daniels, a U.S. Marshal who goes to Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a Rachel Solondo, a woman who has murdered her children. Shutter Island is the home of the hospital that treats the criminally insane. He is partnered with a Chuck Aule, another U.S. Marshal, to investigate the disappearance. Their journey reveals hints of hush hush radical experimentation on the inmates, a possible government conspiracy, mind control, and sicko brain surgeries. The narrative includes a mighty hurricane and lots of descriptions of water ( symbolism), Teddy's dreams, a code that might have been left by Solondo that could explain her disappearance and the possible existence of a Mr. Andrew Laeddis ( more on him later) on Shutter Island, and well placed flash back scenes in which readers learn of Daniel's life--his alcoholism, his father's death,  his life as a soldier, and above all, his love for his wife Dolores who perished in a fire that was started by Laeddis.<br /><br /> The ending is a shocker, and the novel...well, let's just say, it's an incredibly moving investigation into the hearts, souls, and minds of those that are damaged.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Once in a while there comes a film that completely moves you.  THE GRAPES OF WRATH is one of those films.  The movie has three major components that make it an excellent film, a story based on the classic novel by John Steinbeck, the magnificent cinematography, and the historical significance in terms of American history.  The film undoubtedly defines the unending relevance of the American dream and manifest destiny, and John Ford depicts those themes with the Joad family's cross-country trek from Oklahoma to California seeking better opportunities further west after losing their land.<br /><br />John Ford shows how far the American Dream has come.  The film is a reflection of the workingman and American society during the Great Depression as well of the results of the New Deal - the revitalization of the American landscape.  However, the film is about one family and their perseverance to survive in an ever-changing society, but always keeping the past in mind.  Ford shows the Joad's unfortunate circumstance from a family who owned their own land to a nomadic family who became migrant workers; their story represents more than a thousand families' experiences.<br /><br />The film has its defining moments.  In one of the scenes mother Joad (Jane Darwell) is preparing to leave her homestead in Oklahoma and discards a few mementos she has collected over the years from a newspaper article and a postcard depicting the Statue of Liberty, but she happens to keep what looks like a porcelain dog that commemorates the St. Louis Expo of 1904.  Another defining moment is the last few minutes of the film.  It is one of the most legendary and empowering scenes in American film history, which shows Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) making his most moving soliloquy.<br /><br />THE GRAPES OF WRATH will tug at the heartstrings.  Although some may refer the film as out-dated, the story is a part of American history, and it brings an understanding and realization of the hardships that those who owned and lived on farms from the Midwest and dust bowl states experienced during the late 1920s and 1930s in order to continue to live the American dream.  It is not a film that should be missed in one's lifetime.ms from the Midwest and dust bowl states experienced during the late 1920s and 1930s in order to continue to live the American dream.

B000ID1J0E|4.0|I doubt if anyone else could have pulled-off playing Hunter S. THompson as well as Johnny Depp. The actor who portrayed Ichabod Crane and Captain Jack Sparrow to perfection was the best choice - perhaps the ONLY choice - to play the founder of Gonzo Journalism.    Watching the film, you can tell that Duke realizes that his friend, Dr. Gonzo, is dangerous when he is high on drugs and, yet, you have to wonder why he continues his association with him. If I had a friend like that, I would have ended my friendship with him years ago.    To really enjoy this film, you have to try to remember that the two lead characters are high or drunk during the majority of the film. Both only see the world and people around them through an intoxicated haze. Duke tries to keep himself as safe as possible when Gonzo goes off the deep end several times, including the bathroom, elevator and diner scenes. I fully expected Gonzo to actually stab somebody with that knife he carried-around.    Duke and his friend pay for their trips to Vegas with bad checks, trash the rooms they are staying in and fly by the seats of their pants the whole time.    While I enjoyed the film very much, I would certainly not want people like Dr. Gonzo and Raoul Duke in my life.
B000CNESU8|5.0|Quickie movie review: perhaps the most prescient movie ever, definitely the most prescient made about television, viewers and Corporate America. An almost \\"fantasy movie\\" team in front of the camera and behind it produced a flick that lives up to their combined talents. I can think of three incredible scenes in which actors/actresses nearly burn up the screen with brilliant timing, emotion, diction -- and none of those actors/actresses are among the four who got top billing for this movie. They've got several other such scenes of their own.    Now to the extras, which is the reason I bought this two-disc set. I already had the movie via the first DVD release.    You've got interviews with almost all the principals still living, including director Sidney Lumet and actress Faye Dunaway. And they cover an incredible amount of ground concernting the making of the movie (one reason they had such an incredible cast is the script was so good, nobody they offered a part to turned them down. So, the producers got all their first choices. As several cast members are dead, it's been over 30 years since the casting and admitting cast substitutions is common in Hollywood, that's a claim you can take at face value.)     There's also a Paddy Chayefsky interview from \\"Dinah\\" (remember her show from afternoons after the soaps were finished?) and another interview with Lumet, who also provides a commentary. Hey, I was more than satisfied enough to set aside free time for watching the extras.    The only part of the extras that disappointed was the Walter Cronkite interview. I've read interviews with Cronkite concerning this movie over the years when he fairly crackled with observation. Maybe it's just that he's aging.     Anyway, the movie alone is worth the bucks. Throw in the extras and you've got a bargain.
B00003CWPL|5.0|Either you will love it or you'll hate it. I love it. It has my favorite line. at the start of the movie. \\"they're not even sure it's a baby\\" the movie is best in an old rundown theatre around 3 in the morning.
1594489505|4.0|I was surprised that I did not enjoy this book as much as I expected to.  In my opinion, Mr. Hosseini's first novel \\"The Kite Runner\\" was one of the best books published in the last ten years.  When all of the reviews that I read said that \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was even better, I rushed out to buy it.  Where \\"The Kite Runner\\" kept me riveted, this latest book, while in and of itself was excellent, did not rise to the same level.  I felt that some of the periods of Afghani history were covered too quickly and could have benefitted from a more extensive description to really provide a stronger impact of these events on the lives of the women central to the book.  That being said, this book did expose me to many things about Afghani history that I just did not know and it really opened my eyes to what people, mostly women, endured through the changing powers of Afghanistan.  Although I was disappointed, mostly because written reviews gave me extremely high expectations, I still highly recommend this book.  I feel that Mr. Hosseini is a brilliant new star in modern literature and I look forward to future novels.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|The above quote is oddly enough very approprate when talking about the final season of 'Gilmore Girls.'  Coming off a lackluster sixth (which had its strengths, but overall was the worst season of the series), the new producers had a lot of bad Blood to fix, as well as the problem of continueing a show that for the most part was the brainchild of a single woman - who was now completley out of the picture.    After stumbling over the first several episodes the season starts to take-off around episode six, and while it never blossoms into the 'Gilmore Girls' of years past, it definately held it own as an entertaining and engaging series.  The main focus for this year was Rory coming to terms with Graduating from College - and what life after college has in store for her.  She spends the year questioning her goals, relationships, and place within the world (just like every other 22 year-old about to strike it on their own for the first time).  Lorelai finds herself in a similar delimma.  After playing Rory's mother for so many years, she starts to have to life a life without her daughter.  She eventually falls for her one time flame Christopher with interesting results.    But than anything this is the season of growing up and a season of change.  While this season also includes the series finale, it was not decided as a series finale until 10 days before it aired.  The producers were trying to get another season out of the series, which in my opinion would have been a mistake.  While this series finale is low-key and not exactly a 'blockbuster ending' some series are graced with, it fits the series perfectly.  All loose ends are tied up, all the characters have grown up, they know their place in the world, and everyone is looking forward to a new life ahead of them.  It's sad to see the girls go, but they couldn't have ended on a better note.
0515141429|4.0|Jack Reacher is a drifter. Not a vagrant or a fugitive, but a transient by choice. After spending his entire life in the army (his father was military, and Reacher was an elite military policeman) he's decided he wants to live free, literally with just the clothes on his back, some money in his pocket, and a folding toothbrush clipped to his pants. He throws away his clothes when they're dirty, buying new, economical ones to replace them.     Six months after his discharge, he asks the Greyhound driver to let him out in Margrave, Georgia. It is a spontaneous decision driven by the recollection of a story told to him by his older brother about Blind Blake, a famous blues guitarist who was supposed to have died in the small town. Margrave is the perfect small southern American town - literally. Its lawns are all manicured, the streets are spotless, and its inhabitants live a life of leisure.     Within hours of his arrival in Margrave Reacher is arrested for a multiple murder. Once his alibi and bona fides are confirmed Reacher is released, at which time he makes the shocking, coincidental discovery that one of the murder victims is his big brother, a US Treasury Agent. As Reacher joins forces with the local cops to investigate, he learns that the bucolic façade of Margrave is just that - a façade. Reacher uncovers a conspiracy that involves most of the authority figures in Margrave, as well as some well-placed outside officials. Reacher is forced to use his considerable bag of tricks to counter the ruthless conspirators and help end the threat to the innocent townspeople.    I'm not really sure of Reacher as a character yet - he seems to be a borderline immoral, yet just man who is not afraid to use his considerable military skills to accomplish his goals. I'll have to wait to read a few more of Childs' books to see how the character develops.

The tag line is the truth, it will give you a great seat to see the Planet Earth as you've never seen it before. Such a vast, unlimited viewing of our world.  :)

IN ONE PART OF THE AMAZON WEB PAGE APPEARS THAT IS ONLY ONE CD AND IN THE SAME PAGE APPEARS THREE CD'S: GREAT CONFUSION AT THE MOMENT OF THE SELECTION OR WHEN WE ORDER. AMAZON REMOVE THE DESCRIPTION OF THOSE THREE CD'S THAT ONLY CONFUSE TO ALL OF US. THE CD IS EXCELLENT. THE SELLER ALSO IS EXCELLENT. BUT THE WEB PAGE TO SELECT OR WHERE WE SEE THE DETAILS IS A MESS.
817224164X|4.0|It is the year 2008. As the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq enter their seventh and fifth years respectively, anti-war sentiment has reached a fever pitch among left-wing segments of the American population. During a day of nationwide mass protests, large contingents of Washington's 250,000 strong crowd, aided by certain disaffected units of the armed forces, storm the White House, the Capitol and other government buildings and declare a new government to be headed by Senator Charles Schumer, with a Cabinet consisting of Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton, Cynthia McKinney, Diane Feinstein, Barbara Streisand, Michael Moore and other prominent left wingers. Responding to the call of the new government, legions of illegal immigrants, radical college students, racial minorities and assorted left-wing types follow suit in cities across the nations and assume authority from the overthrown \\"tyrannical\\" regime. The new government immediately declares our foreign \\"adventures\\" at an end, and begins evacuating the troops, issuing a proclamation assuming all war guilt and begging forgiveness from the Iraqi and Afghan people, as well as Al-Quaida. The rest of the world, seeing the newfound \\"reasonableness\\" of America's new leaders, queues up with grievances in hand. The new \\"People's Republic\\" starts a round-table international discussion which will result in a treaty that 1. reduces the US military to a token contingent of around 100,000 men. 2. cedes southern California, Arizona, New Mexico and 1/3 of Texas to Mexico. 3. Forces the U.S. to pay trillions of dollars in reparations to dozens of nations and non-state actors, including Mexico, al-Quaida, Iraq, Iran, Vietnam, etc. 4. New York City is declared an international city under the control of the U.N. while South Florida goes to Cuba and New Orleans declares itself the capital of the new nation of New Africa. The results? Inflation is at unprecedented levels. The U.S. economy collapses. Millions are begging in the streets. White Americans in the reconquered territories are being systematically discriminated against and sporadically massacred. When the first reparations payment is late, UN troops occupy New England. Communist China prepares to take advantage of the situation. The country is in chaos.<br /><br />How would you feel about this? What would you do? Would you calmly sit back and fondly hope that things would turn out ok in the end, or would righteous indignation compel you to take action and do whatever it took to reverse the situation and restore your country's strength and independence? Perhaps this book, if you shook off a lifetime of incessant government and media propaganda, could help you put yourself in the shoes of an early twentieth century German and understand why Hitler thought the way he did and why he was not only democratically elected but enjoyed the love and support of the vast majority of his people until the day he died. Without giving sanction to all his ideas or actions, I could without reservation wish that America had one statesman who loved his country as much as Hitler did.<br /><br />As for the notorious book itself, printed with a stark and scary cover obviously meant to color your opinion of the book's contents, I recommend it to both students of the era and modern day practitioners of the political art, especially conservatives. Of course, being on the Index Liborum Prohibitorum of much of the \\"free\\" world, there are an ever shrinking number of countries where one may even legally be allowed to read the book, so get it while you still can. Much of the book deals with contemporary German problems, which would probably only interest history buffs like myself. Contrary to popular belief, Hitler does not rant about the Jews on every page of the book. While the \\"Jewish problem\\" is addressed, it does not occupy a large portion of Mein Kampf and Hitler's opinions on the subject were probably not that different from large and influential portions of every society in the civilized world at the time. Hitler was not an intellectual or a polished writer but he was a political master and a genius on the subject of human psychology, especially as exercised upon mass society. And that is where this book would be interesting and relevant to a modern audience, especially those involved in concrete politics. Hitler was not only spot-on but scathingly hilarious (I know I sound like Franz Liebkind now- \\"The Fuhrer was a terrific dancer!\\") when describing the shortcomings of the conservative politicians of his day and their tragicomic actions in the face of the communist/liberal threat. It's obvious that conservatives never change- a weak, bloodless and cowardly breed of hidebound lackwits, impotently opposing societal degeneration, foreign threats and existential destruction with witty repartee, dithering, toothless political gestures, patriotic fustian and endless compromise. Hitler deals in depth and- in my opinion- with great insight on the subjects of political propaganda of both the written and spoken kind, the use of media, symbolism, personality, mass psychology and all aspects of how to achieve political success. Obviously, conditions vary greatly in time and place, but the human material stays the same and the one overriding rule still applies to politics- men follow courage and the method by which one displays that courage is physical (by defending one's beliefs in the presence of the enemy) and moral (by always telling an unpopular truth, despite the hatred and opprobrium that will be showered upon you). Never back down and never surrender.<br /><br />Propaganda is a part of every war but there has never been a war in American history in which the propaganda has continued to be shoved down the population's collective throat 60 years after the enemy's defeat. Even Robert E. Lee was lauded as an American hero by the North a mere 5 years after our Civil War. Americans should ask themselves why we are still subject to insulting governmental indoctrination about the Nazis 3 generations after WWII. Reading this book would be a good start to answering that question.ized world at the time.

B0008ENIAC|5.0|MILDRED PIERCE brought Joan Crawford her very first Academy Award in 1945, playing a valiant mother willing to sacrifice everything for her daughters' happiness.<br /><br />Mildred Pierce (Crawford) is a frumpy middle-class housewife who invests every spare cent and waking moment into educating and bettering her two children; teenager Veda (Ann Blyth) and precocious Kay (Jo Anne Marlowe).  When her husband Bert (Bruce Bennett) moves on to greener pastures, Mildred has no other option than to fling on the shoulderpads and enter the workforce.  Despite her eventual success in opening a chain of restaurants, nothing she ever does or provides is \\"good enough\\" for Veda.  Her ego spinning wildly out of control, Veda manipulates her mother and everyone around her, with dire consequences...<br /><br />MILDRED PIERCE features some classic confrontation scenes between Crawford and Ann Blyth, who is so good as the evil Veda that you just want to throttle her!  Based on the novel by James M. Cain (who also wrote \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\"), MILDRED PIERCE revived Joan Crawford's flagging film career and gave way to a series of similarly-themed noir drama roles at Warner Brothers.  The amazing cast also includes Jack Carson, Lee Patrick, Zachary Scott and Eve Arden as Mildred's wisecracking best friend (in what surprisingly turned out to be her sole Oscar-nominated performance).<br /><br />Followers of the infamous Joan Crawford/Bette Davis rivalry will be quick to notice that Max Steiner's musical score recycles portions of the main love theme from the 1942 Bette Davis vehicle \\"Now Voyager\\" (mostly during Crawford's love scenes).  Whether or not Crawford noticed this, it's another great twist in the story of the reportedly bitter feud during their days as Warner Brothers' premier leading ladies.<br /><br />The DVD includes a brilliantly-restored print of the movie (it's the best this title has ever looked on home video).  Bonus features (on the flipside of the disc) are just as good, with the acclaimed  feature-length TCM documentary \\"Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\", narrated by Anjelica Huston, and featuring interviews with surviving co-stars and directors, biographers, historians, plus Crawford's adopted daughter Christina (who talks about the incidents in her book \\"Mommie Dearest\\").  A trailer gallery for all of the Crawford/Warner Brothers films is also quite interesting.<br /><br />(Double-sided, single-layer disc)feature-length TCM documentary \\"Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\", narrated by Anjelica Huston, and featuring interviews with surviving co-stars and directors, biographers, historians, plus Crawford's adopted daughter Christina (who talks about the incidents in her book \\"Mommie Dearest\\").
