1594744769|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about the story being bad, the story is excellent, the pictures are too. Though sometimes, I was a little disappointed in the picture from reading the description first, but what can you do?<br /><br />The story starts out, I'm introduced to Jacob whom I admit I really don't like much and I'm starting to think I'm not going to like this book much at all, but I'm sucked in a bit by the mysterious circumstances of his grandfather Abe's death and then I'm to endure awhile of uneventfulness that finally leads Jacob to the island that Abe had spoke of to his young grandson who dismissed them as fabrications.<br /><br />Meeting the children and Jacob spending time with them really does bring the feeling of old-timey sideshows and that was definitely the part I enjoyed the most. This is also the time I decided that I didn't hate Jacob after all, he progressed into a much, much less annoying person.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game its easy to play and both of my kids can play it so that's definitely a plus. read the directions and you'll have no problems.  you play and revive points to earn more games.
0786868724|5.0|Having read Albom's three other major works, I found them enjoyable but far from profound. In fact, I questioned whether other writers were more worthy of publication than his more recent works of fiction. Going back to nonfiction, Albom may have prodcued his best work in \\"Have a Little Faith\\".<br /><br />The story begins as the author is asked to write the eulogy for his rabbi, who has failing health. Albom has fallen away from his faith, going so far as to marry outside of it. Reluctantly, Albom agrees to the eulogy and sets upon a series of interviews to get to know the rabbi on a personal level. More than theology lessons, the conversations seek to be a series of life lessons.<br /><br />As this journey begins, Albom seeks to do charity work in Detroit and crossed pathes with Henry Covington. Far from a model citizen in his early life, Covington finds himself the pastor of an inner-city church with a massive hole in the ceiling. Covington takes the most deperate into his church. The life and faith lessons he provides are equally profound. If you are sick, you are accepted in a hospital. If you are spiritually ill, a church should welcome you.<br /><br />Weaving the stories together, Albom creates an easy yet moving read about coming back to faith. On one hand, he seems to me reconciling the Christian and Jewish facets of his life. On a larger level, the evident message is that it is never too late to come back to faith.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case does exactly what it is supposed to. The case protects my kindle fire when I have occasionally dropped it, and the stand is easy to use. The front of the case, which covers the screen, is soft, not hard, but still protects it very well. I am very pleased with this product!

B006ON41FC|4.0|This game is fun but there are some problems. First when ever you start the game is freezes for a couple seconds. then when you go to the shop sometimes it won't even let you shop. But over all it is a good game.
B000LY6DEC|5.0|One of the best genesis albums without Peter Gabriel. A definite essential for fans of genesis or even casual classic rock music fans.
B0077DBZXO|5.0|My daughter and I love animated movies and this movie has been on our bucket list for quite some time.  We check for new releases on Amazon each Saturday for our matinee. When we saw Puss and Boots show up in the list, there was a jubilant celebration.<br /><br />We like cartoons that are well animated and contain a great mix of action, music, and dialog... this movie hits all of those categories. I found some of the humor in Shrek (the film this movie was spawned from) to be a little borderline \\"grown up\\"... not that it was inappropriate, but there were jokes I wouldn't want her repeating... none of that here in Puss in Boots. The music, the action and the dialog all work together so well...<br /><br />This is Zorro, a nursery rhyme, a great Latin score, and an action flick all wrapped up in a beautiful furry package, with boots.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Wow!! Amazing graphics,plot line, and is very suspensful<br />But......<br />well just as soon as I got into this game it told me I needed to pay to play on! I am sick of this people! Don't even put out a free version if you have to pay after a certain period of time. Seriously!<br />Other than that great app. Giving three  stars for a great reason to.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun game, especially to get all the achievements. Its still even enjoyable to go for distance as well. The fact that I got it for free makes it even better
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter recommended the Hunger Games series, and it was a great suggestion.  I literally read all day and all night until I finished the book.<br />Not only are the lead characters  well drawn and appealing...but minor characters, the dresser, people in the Games who are quickly eliminated...and<br />those who are there till almost the end.  You will remember these people for the rest of your reading life.
B003Y5H54W|4.0|As an Artistic Fantasy Romance this movie was very watchable.<br /><br />The visual elements were superb (a red riding hood frequently shown on a snowy terrain backdrop - wow:)<br /><br />The actors were very good and the plotline was entertaining - containing elements of adventure, friendship, romance, and mystery (revealed at the end as always:)<br /><br />I thought it was neat the way they spun a unique story out of something I thought I knew!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Convenient to use and many options.  Makes research and study very easy. I particularly enjoy the access to the many different translations and the highlighting tool.
0743201140|4.0|I required for this book to be delivered quickly and brand new as the cover has a code on it that was required for a class I'm taking. The code is then used as part of the reading for an online evaluation of the reader. The book appeared to be brand new, excellent condition. The seller did a great job. The code on the book didn't work and I had to notify the website of the problem. It was corrected within a day and all was well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was without a doubt my favorite series I have EVER read!! It's so amazing and intense. I couldn't ever put it down, putting it down felt like you were missing your favorite tv shows. The characters become so alive and it's overall amazing(:
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Its great very fun to play. You can solve the mahjong levels, with a good story line. Thanks for sharing the game.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, but here are my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Definitely a good workout that you will feel the next day<br />-Easy to fit in a workout since it's pretty short<br />-I like Jillian as a host<br />-Cheap price<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Even though you can skip between levels 1, 2, and 3 I still wish there was more variety. A few level 1 workouts, a few level 2's, etc. would be nice.<br />-It's annoying that you have to watch the intro every time, but like others have said, I just get changed, put on my shoes, etc.<br /><br />I do recommend this DVD, especially for people looking for a quick workout they can fit in at home. I already do group fitness classes at the gym, which I love, so this gives me a way to do something similar at home.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|OMG! i could not put it down it was sooo good. With emily being gay, aria hooking up with a teacher, hanna shoplifting and spencer stealing her sisters boyfriends. THIS IS OFFICIALLY THE BEST BOOK EVER
B005723JSQ|5.0|As an avid Sophie Kinsella fan I have read every single book that she has ever written. I must say I was getting a little bit bored with the Shopaholic series. I was starting to think she would never get away from it. But boy was I wrong.<br /><br />This book grabbed me from page one and did not disappoint.I actually read it in one sitting. Crazy right! Poppy, the main character, is a female that everyone can relate too. She is the girl that everyone would be friends with. Her personality is one that exudes from the pages. She is the girl that loses her very expensive engagement ring. And fromt this the story begins.<br /><br />This is a must read!<br /><br />Five stars
B006P0FIGU|5.0|I found this movie REALLY REALLY good and funny at times. I hope they make more. Orlando Bloom playing the bad guy for once was a real nice extra.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I have just now finished reading Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. This book had been recommended by virtually all of my friends. It is not a long book and I easily read it in two or three sittings. I found it well written, simple to follow, and I could relate to the characters in a personal way.<br /><br />I feel that I did not have the reaction to this book most of my friends have had. They talk about the book being exciting and the male character as glamorous and mysterious, as if he were from a Bronte novel--possibly a type of Heathcliff, from Wuthering Heights. I saw the man as very sad, lonely, very flawed; he had a broken spirit, feelings of being unworthy because of an abusive early childhood. I felt for him.<br /><br />The main female character, Anastasia, told the story; she was the voice and the point of view we followed. She was a sweet, inexperienced girl, newly graduated from college and about to begin her first job at the end of this book. I've been told there are sequels. I am anxious to see how this story unfolds. Can his broken spirit be healed...or is he doomed?<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all who enjoy reading fanfiction, to all who find a bit of angst a necessary part of romance, and to those who enjoy descriptive love-making.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|addictive game.  nice to have the 1 free hint every 12 hrs too.  runs great on Samsung galaxy s2.  No problems for me.

1439153663|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Beautifully written with two narrators allowing the reader to visualize all accounts via two characters. The historical imagery comes to life with every sentence. The reader feels the joys and the tragedies of these characters in 18th Century Virginia.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app almost daily. It has proved to be pretty accurate.  A great free weather app for the kindle. The only thing I'd like to see is a more accurate hour by hour prediction.
B0067Q42BY|1.0|This is a fun app but locks up my tablet and then won't let me out of the app short of shutting the tablet down and that takes several minutes! Don't spend your money on this one!

B000C13Y2S|1.0|One legs fell off the mii tripod within the first hout I had it.  This rendered the tripod function useless I should have returned it but that would cost too much.  I would not buy  product again
B004SBS8LA|4.0|this is a amazing app but I think it should be free its free on my dads I pad why not on kindle
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I purchased this backpack (and received it) only days before making a trip which included lugging a lot of camera gear to Ireland to photograph a family wedding there. I needed very good protection, lots of storage compartments and the ability to customize the interior of the backpack to securely hold all of my photo equipment (Nikon D7000, vertical grip, two flashes, two lenses, chargers, batteries (D7000 and a pile of AAs, cables, cards and more).<br /><br />Critical to my requirements, I needed a backpack that would fit inside my larger carry-on with room to spare for other \\"stuff\\" of high value that I wanted near me at all times on the plane (not for check-in baggage!).<br /><br />Wow! ...not only did this bag work out extremely well for room-to-spare and safe protection from shock for all of my photo gear, but, it fit inside my carry-on perfectly and allowed me to add plug converters/power adapters, and several other personal high-value items to the carry-on with adequate room for this bag to be included.<br /><br />Traveling by air or not, I highly recommend this back-pack for those who wish to purchase a high quality photo backpack at a very fair price. It's built very sturdy, has more then adequate storage places and the price is \\"right\\".
B0064NTZKI|5.0|This documentary actually comes in two parts. Both are excellent and highly recommended. Only Allen would hurry things along on the set in order to make it to a Knicks basketball game on time. If you're not ready to buy, but are still curious, you can rent the videos on iTunes for $4.00. They also have the bundle containing parts 1-2 for $15.00. Either way, these documentaries are well worth the time to absorb.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|Takes 3 taps before you can actually select text to highlite or underline.  Often repeated taps still don't bring up select menu.  Selecting text precisely takes practice--but selection guides (small circles at either edge of selected text) are a help.  To highlight another sentence you must repeat it all again, making sequential annotations cumbersome.  Sometimes takes multiple taps on Icon menu to get any response.
B004LROUNG|5.0|It has been a while since Grisham produced something this good. The story drags at times and isn't on par with his earlier books, but it was still a decent read. Grisham seems more intent on capturing real world law, thus his books don't have the same action as they used to. Still, he's a master of character development.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is easy enough for children but yet challenging enough for adults. The graphics are good. Very addictive Game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.  I pre-ordered it for a birthday present and was surprised when it shipped out earlier than promised.  Well worth the price and it makes a great gift.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote lets me create notes anywhere, and automatically sync everywhere; on my Windows 7 PC, my Kindle Fire, and on my iPhone.  I store birthdays, job materials lists, grocery shopping lists, personal equipment data, router encryption keys, important dates, and since they automatically sink on all my wirelessly connected devices, backup is automatic.
1595825045|5.0|I was originally going to pass on this item, but finally caved in when I found out it was filled with commentary.  Lots of excerpts from both Mike and Bryan.  Definitely worth the 20 or so dollars I paid for it.

0517591812|4.0|Purchased the paperback book for my wife. She loved it. After reading it, she gave it to our Marine grand-son to read. I re-ordered the larger hardback to keep as the smaller paperback was harder to read the small print. She is currently reading the \\"New York\\" novel by him.
B0042U2HLY|5.0|U &#34;Gunter Wand conducts Bruckner&#34;<br /><br />These comments are for the 9 CD boxed set of Anton Bruckner (1824-96) symphonies conducted by Gunter Wand. The recordings were made between 1974-1981.<br /><br />Each CD comes in a cardboard sleeve and all disk are housed in a sturdy hinged cardboard box. There is no booklet. The only notes are track identification on each CD sleeve. The RCA Red Seal label suggests to me that these recordings were first issued on phonograph records.<br /><br />Not possessing any musical training I will limit my comments to a few general observations.<br /><br />I purchased this collection based upon other, more knowledgeable, reviews and the fact that in my collection I had two of Buckner's symphonies on CD, the 3rd and the 4th, and have played them many times and greatly admired them.<br /><br />How these recording compare to identical recordings by other orchestras and conductors is beyond my expertise. I enjoyed listening to this set and recommend them to you if your are inclined to expand your classical music library at a very reasonable price.

B0044XV684|4.0|My sister has this book and it is so cute! We have cooked several of the foods and it's a fun way to remember the Harry Potter series.
0765326353|5.0|This book is amazing. Nuff said. Well, I guess more should be said.<br /><br />I honestly wasn't it expecting it to be that great. I mean 1000 pages is a lot to read. And yet, once you get into it 1000 pages feels more like 10. I couldn't go to sleep until I actually finished reading it. It's that great. My favorite character by far was Kaladin. He was the most interesting and the most likable by far. Although by the end of the book, you appreciate all the other main characters equally, and you're not as annoyed when you aren't reading Kaladin's chapter. Or at least I felt that way, seeing as how I'm annoyed often by multiple main character books... because most of the time I end up forming a bias for just one character.<br /><br />I also thought the story line wasn't slow at all. It might be hard for others to get into the book if you don't find the plot or the characters interesting. Fortunately enough, I found both interesting, which is probably one of the reasons I liked the book so much. Not to mention their way of thinking is so different compared to ours, and yet it feels really natural that you don't really second-guess it--I feel this says a lot about how well Sanderson developed his world.<br /><br />And then at the end, Sanderson provides hints at what is to come in his sequel. I won't mention any of the hints, but there are a few, not just one, for possible future plot lines, and I am interested in seeing how Sanderson will develop them.<br /><br />I could go on and on but then I would end up spoiling the story line.<br /><br />I also bought this book in Kindle format, and this was probably the first time I was tempted to buy the hard copy of the book. Even though I read through this book pretty fast, it is definitely a book that has to be savored.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|is a great app and it helps you spiritually. I love it and I recommend it for all this Bible rocks

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|If you were around in the 1990's, you heard Porishead's two studio albums, [[ASIN:B000001FI7 Dummy]] and [[ASIN:B000003TSP Portishead]] if you listened to new sounds and music. As grunge was fading, Portishead, along with Tricky and Massive Attack, put out electronic-based monliths that had meat on the bone. \\"Eletronica\\" was a marketing term, but Poritshead's deep, subliminal, and truly frightening soundscapes were unrivaled. Their ability to create creepiness by keeping the sound small but packing it with hidden layers make their first two outings classics. Their music was not music with electronic production placed for trend value, but electronic darkness from the ground up, that created emotion from the music out.<br /><br />In 2008, the band came back for Third. Just when the blackness cannot get anymore black, blacker it gets.<br />The band follows the same blueprint to a large extent: minimal basic tracks with wads of sound packed into the music's most hidden corners. Here, the instrumentation is more organic, and effective: the gauzy tremilo guitars, Beth Gibbon's piercing flat voice, its detachment from the music making  the tracks that much more emotional. Listen to \\"The Rip,\\" where the jump-cut, muted percussion creates the fragmentation of hallucinations, your most psychotic nightmares. These are the dreams you tell NO ONE!!<br /><br />The electronic sheen is strongly present, but less glossy, and the playing is starker, more blunt in its horror. You really have to get all of Portisheads work, and live with it a very long time, let it seep under your skin.It may sound the same at first, but this band has the mark of any great band--the differences will emerge as the subtleties imbed, and the fold opens. Slowly. Bleakly.
B0072GPQ72|5.0|My wife and I passed on seeing this in a theater due to us most likely sobbing at \\"those parts\\". We elected to see it in our own theater and let er loose. I know how good it is and have read all about it. That and Speilberg makes it a sure thing for us. Can't wait to see it on our own theater as it was put together for films such as this.<br /><br />OK, I have now seen this movie. My wife refused as she is emotionally attached to horses as she used to show them. I felt bad after this movie mostly because of the way these animals were treated at that war. I suppose the ending was a happy one (spoiler alert). But the scenes were to graphic for me. Human carnage i can tolerate but not animals. Besides the above comment, the movie was exceptional and typical Spielberg, excellent production, maybe to excellent. I doubt i watch it again unless I want to be reminded of how animals are treated in our history.

1439107955|5.0|Eradicate, a good word when it comes to cancer.Unfortunately, I don't think it can be or will be applied to this pox on living organisms for some time to come.My views are based on actual practice experience and now my views are deftly backed up by this wonderful book.From the first time I read a review on it and followed its progress I knew it would do well and it did, it won the Pulizer as it should.The author, an oncologist himself did write something unique here.A look at the history of and development of the cancer treatments and difficulties we know right up to today.He did his research and knows his stuff and in between rounds and after work was able to put together an expansive look and explanation of just what we are dealing with here.Yes, there are external factors which cause or contribute but mostly it is a game of chance with your genes.One wrong switch flips on because of a mutant gene and the cascade begins. Well, it is really not that simple but then again in a complete reductionist view, it can be.Life it seems is really a crap shoot when it comes to cancer, smoke, drink, eat fatty foods and enjoy your bar-b-que because you just might live to 100. Run, exersize, eat the right foods,live well,don't smoke and you could be dead by 40 from untreatable cancer of whatever.Some things can be handled nicely by medicine and some despite surgery,chemo,prayer, whatever, too bad your dead. The book is very inclusive and has something for everyone as it can be quite technical at times and rather pedestrian at others.One thing I will say is that it was well written  for someone with no experience writing before.It will appeal to all walks of life, from the medical clinician to the nurse on the floor to the common person curious about a very taboo topic even today.For those who want to know more about this thing we call cancer and just why with all the money thrown at it we have yet to make truly significant inroads by way of a cure.It does drag somewhat in the middle but stay with it because it will leave you with a better overall knowledge of the subject and will hopefully enlighten you and give those who do suffer hope.This is a must read for medical or nursing students interested in Oncology. For the general public, an explanation and examination of what was and what is, far,far, better than anything our Surgeon General could deliver.Truly, one of the better books yet written on this thorny subject recently and probably will be for some time to come.As was said above,cancer is and always was with us, perhaps it is natures way of thinning the herd from within our bodies rather than from without.We can define it, slow it,put it into remission status,even some can be eliminated almost to the point where we believe that is it gone forever but the lingering fear of return is always present isn't it?. What we can't do unfortunately is say we can eradicate it from the human condition once and forever.Early in my career I worked on an oncology floor and found it to be utterly depressing, full of pain, suffering,heartache and difficult in many ways.You work and work but the result was always the same, death.Sometimes quick,sometimes lingering and slow.True, there are some successes but once cancer has you in its grip, well,the outcome is not always good. Those who work in this field have my utmost respect  and admiration as it is one of the most difficult jobs I've ever experienced. This book will show you why that is so in a broad and comprehensive manner.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|For a couple of months a couple of my mini games quick working and would crash the game if I tried to play them. Today, I was excited to see that there was an update and was hopeful it would fix the crashing problem. It worked! My mini games that were no longer playable became playable again! About an hour later I decided to load up the game again and play through the mini games one more time. I load up the game and what do I find? That ALL my user data has been deleted and I have to completely start over. Update at your own risk.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I am a 56 yr, old breast cancer survivor. I have always been in fairly good physical shape. During and after my treatment I gained approx. 15 lbs.I am now on a maintenance drug that seems to be making it even harder to lose the weight, all of which is in my middle, i.e. stomach and waist.For years I have had a gym membership and spent hours on the treadmill and weight  machines, never breaking a sweat. I decided a few months ago to work out at home with dvd's. I bought a few of the core fursion series and enjoyed those, but I keep losing and gaining the same two-three pounds. I just bought this dvd from Jillian.Each segment is approx. 25 minutes.  I have done level 1 twice this week and have been filling in the off days with a yoga dvd. i do break a a pretty good sweat and my goal is to do the entire dvd in one workout. I am watching my diet,though[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]] some days I am not as strict as I should be. I am truly dedicated to doing this program the way she suggests, however I am not yet convinced it will work for me. I have noticed that I am more toned since starting the core fusion dvd's but I am really looking for weight loss. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced anything similar. I realize my age and my past health issue is a factor but I am determined to take it off. Any thoughts?
B004SUDPXW|5.0|\\"Breaking Bad\\" is and continues to be the best, most brilliantly acted and directed, flawlessly written, and most unpredictable show on television, rivaled only by \\"The Walking Dead\\" (another AMC show).  BB has not lost its ability to surprise.  The show is raw, and not for all tastes, but for those who love edgy entertainment, this is YOUR show.  Bryan Cranston as the high school chem teacher turned meth dealer gamely earns his Emmys as he shows us the evolution of Wltr White from wimpy and mild to out and out badass...Cranston has emerged as a force to be reckoned with.  Aaron Paul, as his yong partner in crime, Jesse,finally received the recognition he deserves for his performance durin this season 3.  And Giancarlo Esposito has emerged as the most complex, subtle, and quietly menacing villain in television history.  Show creator Vince Gilligan, who earned his bones on 9 seasons of \\"The X-Files\\", has given us something truly special.  If you're anything like me, you are not terribly impressed with much of what is on network television.  I like my shows to bea little dangerous and to take creative risks.  Unlike its similar counterpart, Showtimes \\"Weeds\\" which has woefully worn out its welcome, Breaking Bad just keeps getting better.  Gilligan nevr compromises his dramatic logic, andthe writing hasonl;y become sharper and more observant.  The result is a show that is bitingly funny, unpredictable, terrifying and at times unbearably suspenseful.  Buy it right now.  Highest recommendation.

B0009P66TK|5.0|This is my 2nd Invicta and once again, I am in love.  This is a big watch, but its not huge like many others are saying.  I have 6in. wrists and it fits me just fine without looking \\"silly\\".  Even with the leather band, this has a good weight to it, though it wears comfortably.  The way the chronograph keeps time is one of the best I've seen.  Another great watch by Invicta.
B0044XV3QY|3.0|First off, let me say, I really loved this movie.  It was a brilliant achievement for the technical and artistic wizardry that brought an alien world to life on screen in such lavish detail, and with such spectacular visual beauty.  Moreover, the storytelling was great as well.  The movie was well paced, the characters' motivations believable (mostly), the acting was top notch, and the characters that the actors portrayed were (for the non-villains at least) well-drawn, likeable characters with whom the viewer can identify.  All of this makes for a stunning cinematic experience, and I immensely enjoyed watching the film.  For its technical wizardry, and in the sense of  it's been an interesting story, well told, the film deserves five stars.<br /><br />Having said that, however, there is something about the movie that irritated me intensely, and I'm not seeing it mentioned in many of the mostly gushing reviews here, so I guess I will have to be the voice in the wilderness (no pun intended).  In \\"Avatar\\" we are treated to yet another round of the old \\"noble savage\\" myth.  The term's been around since at least the seventeenth century (though the actual idea is much, much older - read Tacitus' comments on how Germanic barbarians had certain virtues that the jaded, decadent Romans of his day lacked, for example), and one would think we'd have learned better than to indulge in such condescending romantic nonsense by now.  Basically, the idea is that people are essentially good and virtuous by nature, and advanced civilization and its institutions are what causes them to lose their way.  This is certainly the interpretation this movie supports, where the Na'vi are seen as unqualifiedly noble, virtuous, unselfish, people, unsullied by greed, rapacity, cruelty, etc. and living in perfect harmony with nature, understanding to the Nth degree the part they are supposed to play in their world's ecosystem.  By contrast, the earth-people - civilized people - are capable of being good, like Sully and Grace and Trudy, but are just as often callous, arrogant, greedy, self-righteous, and so on, and who, in the end, behave like Nazi Einsatzkommandos.<br /><br />The first problem with this is that the idealized noble savage, of the sort depicted here, never existed.  Archaeology reveals evidence of violence and warfare in the earliest and most primitive societies.  There never was a primeval Eden where people lived peacefully in primitive, yet enlightened commune with nature, perfectly in harmony with their world.  Archeology, again, shows that primitive man could be, and usually was, just as destructive of his environment as modern man, it simply took him longer to use up his resources with only primitive technology at his disposal.  And what living in primitive societies actually means is average lifespans of 29, women giving birth to a dozen children in the hopes that at least half of them will live out their first year; it means being helpless when smallpox or cholera or typhus or bubonic plague swoops down on your community and carries off half the population.  It also means superstition and ignorance, and so, perhaps things like, say, a nice human sacrifice to take away the anger of the gods and persuade them to give you a better harvest this year, since the last one was so poor that many of the community starved to death over the winter.  Primitive life is no idyllic dream.  It NEVER was.<br /><br />The second problem with this movie is that it is a clumsy commentary on the history of colonialism, in the form of a fantasy tailored specifically for white people living with a heavy load of liberal, white guilt. And what is ironic is that, entirely unintentionally I'm sure, the film ultimately marginalizes indigenous peoples and affirms white supremacy - this ought to come as no surprise, I suppose, since a great deal of the modern liberal/progressive self-righteous moral preening turns out to be incredibly patronizing when you look at it inthe harsh light of reality.  And what do we see in this movie, when we look at it in that critical light?  Jake Sully is white redemption incarnate - liberal guilt enfleshed.  He serves to redeem the human race in general, and white Europeans in particular, by proving that at least some of us (guilty liberals, naturally) are good.  This, I'm sure, is Cameron's intentional message.  But his unintentional one is that white liberals like him aren't merely good, they're SUPERIOR to just about everybody else.  Look what happens as the movie unfolds: Sully is turns out not only to be a superior human being, he is also a superior Na'vi.  He does what none of these poor natives can do.  After enduring a brief period of contempt and ostracism for the part he played in the land grab perpetrated by the greedy humans, he redeems himself in spectacular fashion by performing a feat beyond the ability of any living Na'vi; he tames the most feared predator  in the skies of Pandora, thereby proving himself to be the most skillful, most courageous warrior imaginable, according to the Na'vi view of things.  He follows this up by assuming leadership of the Na'Vi, and working out their strategy.  Then, of course, his performance in the ensuing fight shows him to be their most valuable player on the battlefield too.  Then, with all the other Na'vi contenders for leadership conveniently dead, Sully not only assumes permanent leadership, he wins the heart of the most desirable girl in the tribe for good measure. The Na'vi now worship the ground he walks on.  As one commentary I read put it: \\"This is a classic scenario you've seen in non-scifi epics from Dances With Wolves to The Last Samurai, where a white guy manages to get himself accepted into a closed society of people of color and eventually becomes its most awesome member.\\"  The natives still end up with a white guy as their leader; it just happens in a kinder, gentler way.  And, of course, being a guilty liberal, he proves to be an enlightened leader, rather than an oppressor.  The natives are now better off than ever.<br /><br />It's a story written, as I've said, by and for guilty white liberals.  If a story like this were written by the colonized people of color themselves, something tells me there would be no white redeemer; the hero would come from within their own ranks, and when the battle was over and won, they'd continue with their lives, under their own leadership, with no humans/white Europeans in sight, whether of the guilty liberal variety or not.  Film makers like Cameron think they are being so just, noble, fair, and enlightened, by rubbing our noses in our own (admittedly) dark past.  But when you look at the story they tell when trying to do it, what you see them do, over and over, and again, probably entirely without meaning to, is rediscovering a sneaky way of turning every story about people of color into a story about ever so noble white people (like them, of course) -- and it's a story that doesn't entirely rewrite the history of colonialism either; they still get to be top dog, at the end.  But what else can you expect?  Self-righteous people, unsurprisingly, usually turn out to be self-centered as well.the harsh light of reality.  And what do we see in this movie, when we look at it in that critical light?  Jake Sully is white redemption incarnate - liberal guilt enfleshed.

B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I liked this app, much easier to use than the browser page and much easier on the eyes. I'd like to see a more minimal interface but that's a minor quibble.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved all three books, they're pretty long but it only took me a weekend to read all 3 and the only time I would stop reading was when I absolutely HAD to sleep. All three are page turners !
0316098329|1.0|hmmmm....I must start by being honest and saying that I could not even get to the end of chapter 2 before I gave up on this book with no intention of ever picking it up again. I had actually searched for emotional books and found this one to be recommended over and over. Upon reading the large number of 5* reviews I decided this was the one. Mistake. So disappointing to me because the premise has the ability to create a fascinating and engaging read...but I feel as though it was a wasted opportunity. I skimmed the rest of the book hoping that the boy did not narrate all of the chapters, as it might have been bearable if it was just a few here and there. It wasn't. I am the mother of a 5 year old and I can tell you I would go completely insane if I had to listen to him talk like this child did. It simply is aggravating and grew old very quickly. I wanted to be among those who adored this book, but I simply was not.
B003L77GRO|5.0|Forget those debbie-downers who think Dexter doesn't get better with age. He does, and the series only gets richer. Granted, there's only so many ways to kill and make the murderer get what's coming to him, but Dexter always gets his man, and the plot continues to re-invent itself as time goes on. Be prepared for some great plot twists, leading up to the more recent Season 6. Keep em coming, Showtime!!!
0307277887|5.0|I'm looking forward to when the UPS man delivers the rest of the books in the Dexter series, because they're page turners!! I mean, hard to put down. After having watched all the seasons on TV, I figured I'd check out the books, and I wasn't dissapointed. A must have for any true Dexter fan!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I was reading [[ASIN:B003L78600 The Hot Box]] by Zane, who writes erotica and I love erotica. Well she mentioned how the show Spartacus has so much sex in it and I was game! Since I don't have cable I got the series from the library.<br /><br />I only had 7 days to watch the entire series before I had to return it. The first episode was so-so. But I'm glad I stuck with it. It was great. The intrigue, the full frontal male nudity, the graphic violence, the acting . . . just wonderful.<br /><br />I will definitely purchase this!

B0073LWEXK|4.0|Really fun and interesting game, but I wish it had been longer or had more levels to it. The graphics are absolutely beautiful.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|If you are old enough to remember the old arcade shooters of the 80s then you will love this game.  It is a mix of Galaga, Asteroids, and Space Invaders.  The controls are a little jerky, but no big deal.  Definitely worth it, especially as the free app of the day.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Very fast, and those effective 8 cores allow you to do many things at once, all at full speed. There also is a 2700K model available for $50 more. That'll give a 4% faster CPU for $50. Whoopie. You'll never see it unless you run a benchmark.<br /><br />Pro:<br />There are 2 issues controlling the speed you get from a modern, multi-core CPU: The number of cores and the speed of each core. This CPU runs 4 cores, each of which your operating system can hyper-thread, giving 8 effective cores. The multiple cores allow several demanding processes each to run at full core speed, and so the speed of each core determines how fast each of those applications runs. This chip is a winner on both counts. But you'll need Windows 7 x64 or 64-bit Linux to take maximum advantage of what this chip offers. It really screams.<br /><br />For we techno-geeks, following are some benchmarks: Floating point calculations are critical to the performance of my image processing and numerical analysis work, so I ran my standard double-precision floating point benchmarks on a single core running at the stock speed under Windows 7x64 Pro and 1600MHz DDR3. This benchmark mixes different proportions of add/subtract/multiply/divide operations doing real-world calculations. A mix of [50%,0%,50%,0%] -- that is, only adds and multiplies, which run very fast -- gives 4.8 Gigaflops (billion floating point operations per second) per core. For a [43,29,14,14] mix, which is relatively heavy on the slow operation of division, I get 1.6 Gigaflops per core, which still is exceptional. Putting this in perspective, the stock i7-2600k gives 10x the performance of a Cray YMP supercomputer of 1992, and is more than 1000 times faster than my Sun Sparcstation of the same era. On the other hand, the stock i7-2600k is around 1/4000 as fast as the Fujitsu \\"K computer\\" in Japan, the world's fastest supercomputer that eats 12 Megawatts of power and costs $10 million/year to run.<br /><br />Con:<br />The CPU fan that Intel provided was a bit noisy. I could hear it wind up in RPM when the CPU came under a heavy computing load. For a few bucks I replaced it and all was good. Mine was probably a fluke, so don't let that get in the way of purchasing an i7-2600k.<br /><br />In summary: Get this chip --- it's a dream. You'll not find a significantly faster CPU near this price for at least a couple of years.

1609611543|5.0|I had been grain-free for a couple of months due to health issues before reading this, so I didn't need the information in this book to convince me to give up wheat.  Yet, many could benefit from giving up wheat and perhaps the author's arguments will convince you.<br /><br />I wanted to write a review to say that the small recipe section at the back is very good.  I've made the pizza crust (made of cauliflower! I love it.  Before this recipe, I had tried some almond flour pizza crust recipes and hadn't liked them at all).  I've also made the apple-walnut bread and really like it too.  Again, I had already tried other almond flour bread recipes and didn't like them.  This loaf has a really good flavor.  I did make one change to the recipe by adding 1/4 cup honey.  I did find it hard to get the loaf cooked through (maybe my honey addition caused this).  I microwave a slice for 30 seconds before eating it and that seems to firm the slice up.<br /><br />Of course, there is no way to replace the texture and taste of bread made with wheat!  That will probably be the hardest part of giving up wheat for anyone....the loss of bread.  Yet, if you are like me, once you break the addiction, you will not miss it very much.

1594744769|4.0|This novel has two quite distinctive parts. I would have gladly given the first half of the story 5 stars, as I was totally captured by its haunting atmosphere, mystery and intrigue as the main character goes in search of information regarding his murdered grandfather's mysterious past. The assortment of dark and troubling pictures only added to the suspense, and I expected the rest of the book to continue as a haunting gothic ghost story. However, the second half of the novel adopts a sort of Harry Potter-ish style with tales of parallel universes, time travel, characters with unique abilities and monstrous villains who seek to rule the world. Although I enjoyed this foray into fantasy, I was also a bit disappointed that the story did not live up to its original haunting atmosphere, but was at times stretching credibility a bit too far and losing its original intrigue in the process. The cliffhanger ending, obviously making room for a sequel, was also unexpected and a bit of a let-down. But overall a very original and imaginative story! I totally loved the weird photos - it is worth noting that this book would be better read in hard copy than electronic format, as the pictures and hand written letters were quite hard to make out on my e-reader, and they are the best part of the book!

B0070R8WY2|5.0|SVE is a newer artist to watch, in my opinion. This is a wonderful album, although I don't know if it will be a breakout. It deserves to be. There are some very good songs and really no bad ones. My favorites are \\"Give Out\\" and \\"All I Can\\". This is one of those albums that rewards close and repeated listening. Those who don't give it a chance will likely be turned off by the fact that most of the songs are meandering or slow building, but one adjusts to the pace after a bit. The digital booklet that comes with the download contains the lyrics, which is really helpful. I definitely appreciated the music more after I could follow the lyrics,which are often hard to make out.<br />That brings me to her voice. A reviewer of her last album, \\"Epic\\", complained about her lack of range. It's a fair criticism. She also sounds a lot like Chan Marshall (Cat Power) to me. That might make it a challenge for her to seperate herself from the herd. I think it will happen, though, and here's why. I personally find the whole \\"confessional singer/songwriter\\" genre to be painfully corny, but, for some reason, I love this artist. Her songs are just smarter and more real to me. So many of her peers leave me rolling my eyes, but she sucks me in. It's a charisma thing. Not everyone will get it, but those who do will be strongly affected. Just watch.<br />Aaron Dessner of The National is apparently already a fan. He produced this album. I don't know how much credit to give him for the growth I see here over \\"Epic\\". I know that the lead single, \\"Serpents\\", could be a National song if Matt Berninger sang it. That's a quibble. SVE is still developing. Bigger things to come? I really hope so. No need to wait, though. \\"Tramp\\" is terrific.
B000VD9MG4|1.0|What a disgusting Movie!  Whoever made this movie and those that gave it a good rating should be on a National Psycho List. Unfortunately I bought Hostel 2 also, and it was just as bad.  I love Horror movies, but this is not a horror, but a gross film.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I found this to be a fun game that I couldn't stop playing. I wish it was longer. I recommend it to fans of game like old school atari stuff.
B0034G4P94|5.0|Great movie! My friend and I were looking for sub par action movie, and got this one, not knowing much about it, and it has became one of my favorites. Good plot, kind of a mix of Cinderella Man and Brothers. Highly recommend! And of course It got to me quickly, and in new condition.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Game worked fine until recent update. The update erased all my saved game data. Also since update it randomly stops the game play and goes to the loading screen. It had done that 5 times in the first level which is not a long level. Very disappointed in the update, I thought I was finally going to have access to the Zen Garden.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover/holder was delivered very promptly by UPS. Ordered on Thursday afternoon and was delivered on Sat. Cover works well and is extremely lightweight. Durability cannot be determined at this time as the cover and stand hinge sections will have to stand the test of time. Will update if any wear problems occur. So far so good.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Bought this a long time ago and even though its free now, I'm glad to say I didn't waste my money. this game is well developed with easy controls, clever dialogue, retro graphics, and entertaining storyline.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I have always loved this movie and all of Whitney's movies. Whitney singing, I will always love you & I have nothing and more. Great music and plot, with suspense. Whitney was great and so was Kevin Costner.
B006DHAT5K|2.0|With a movie like this, you expect a plot that follows a tried and true formula. This movie is no different. About 20 minutes or less into the movie, you can see the ending coming. That aside, it's a decent plot that could have been a good movie. I even think the acting is pretty good. My biggest issue with the movie that rather than making some of the situations cute, it goes for crass and explicit talk and references to sexual situations. I suppose for some people it's no big deal, but for me it made the movie a bit uncomfortable to watch.<br /><br />The movie follows a girl who just lost her job and has just read an article about how women who have had more than 20 lovers have a hard time marrying. This leads to her contracting her womanizing neighbor to help her track down ex-boyfriends to see if they might have changed and might be the one for her to marry. This does lead to some comical situations, but it kind of peters out while other plot lines such as her sister's wedding and the back and forth between her and her neighbor take over. The ending is nice but quite predictable.<br /><br />If you like romantic movies, this one is worth checking out, but beware that there is a lot of explicit sexual talk.
B005K17RU0|4.0|put this on my kindle fire it has been working great. l have had other weather apps on it but they'd would freeze up all the time.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|this game is so much fun and it is for kids and adults I know my cousin who is three loves it she thinks it is addicting thought
B0000033J9|5.0|delivery was quick and the cd works as advertised would buy again.  If you liked the movie you'll like the music.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Great movie! Great Soundtrack and Gosling is really good.  You won't be bored watching this. This will become a classic
0307593312|5.0|Again Murakami writes an enrapturing novel that draws you in despite the hesitation one may have to delve into a book this length.  He has an excellent ability to capture intimate human details that shines through in this his latest novel.  Those who are familiar with Japan or have visited Tokyo will also find this book especially interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app is a great tool for staying consistent on daily Bible reading. it also has many great Bible studies for specific things you may be dealing with. thanks for the great tool!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|This cooler keeps my 2500k below 60 while oc'd to 4.5 GHz AND maxed on intel burn test, down side is if you have the Asus p8z68-v pro you will not be able to use your #1 RAM slot. I also ordered a second fan as it only comes with the one. Simple install and well worth the money.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|This is one of the greatest tributes to Mr Dylan  For anyone who loves Dylan this is a must to have in your collection
0307346617|4.0|it is a bit different in that it is in an \\"Interview\\" style, where the Interviewer travels around the world hearing the accounts of various people.  I enjoyed it very much.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|I was able to watch the bluray disc and I could say, I'm happy and contented. I previously watched this in a moviehouse and I'm glad that I bought this from Amazon. Buy it and you'll see... recommended product...

B007BLDFWG|1.0|Beware, this bird doesn't fly! Nothing interesting ever happens, no reasonable actions or conversations ever come from the sister. Total B.S. and boring to boot! If my brother disappeared for two years then called me out of the blue I would rush to pick him up and the secound thing I would ask after \\"are you okay\\" is \\"where the #@^K HAVE YOU BEEN AND DOING WHAT?\\" Not in this movie, that isn't asked until the 1 hour and 31 minute mark...maybe later!(the movie is 1:41 i believe) Trust me, I am warning you! just wait until its on cable. The acting was good, and Elizabeth Olsen is most definitely...by far....the most talented Olsen. However, this movie was terrible! The script is dull and unimaginative and yet somehow infuriating. The ending is a turd also, watch something else! trust me!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this is the best game from hexage, I see no reason why it worth less than 4 stars. Don't be a jerk if you are getting this fantastic game for free
B004UXUX7S|5.0|as you can see from some of the reviews there are those that would not no a good movie if it bit them on the lower extremities such gormlessness is indictative of the lack of wherewithall to realize a well made , smart , and telling movie of life beautifully made and its real!  movies are definitely made more telling then ever before.  wonderful authentic music of the islands.  wake up to those and watch a well crafted movie and my pick for best picture of the year.  and thank you george clooney for a fantastic perfomance and a great american.  wonderful in all aspects.  A # 1 movie of the year
B006ON41FC|5.0|Very simple addictive game. I like the different challenges.  Makes it fun to play.  I recommend downloading this game. Good luck!
B005BJ7Y54|5.0|This is a great album through and through. I just started listening to MPR (Minnesota Public Radio \\"The Current\\") and I kept hearing the DJ say \\"The Girls\\". I finally checked them out and was very happy with my purchase. I \\"literally\\" can not stop listening to \\"Alex\\". Looking forward to the next one.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A great game! The screen is great on the kindle fire! My three year old cousin loves it!He would sit there and play it all day on my kindle fire if he could.
B005ZUR724|5.0|don't believe the other reviews about the updates and stuff. this game works great and is a load od fun. and don't go by the amount of stars, this game just got dropped because of the people who had trouble updating it. its a great game just like wow.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Definitely worth my time. i loved every chapter it was very addicting! i would recommennd getting this app. 5 stars definitely!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|very good app temperature is always right with my thermometer on my porch better weather forecasts and more accurate forcasts then the 5 news weather channels we have in UT.

B004Y5AV4M|1.0|Instead of a reformed rake, you have a guy, after only one month's acquaintance,  wanting to marry a girl who says she doesn't care if he is reformed from his old ways as long as she is included in any future \\"orgies\\".  Not my idea of a good love story. Heyer has put out some very enjoyable reads, but this one bombed imo.  I love the sweeter love stories. This one had an ick factor for me.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I gave this a 3 as it seems to be a great game by other reviewers, but seems to force close on some of the newer devices. It will not run on my Bionic, I saw a few others who posted like the Rezound and Galaxy S II .hope that is fixed soon.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Thanks Yahoo for forcing the upgrade to v.10. Very slow and slowed my Nook Color to a standstill.<br /><br />Uninstalled... doubtful I'll reinstall unless I can go back to v.6 or something newer if they ever get it right. Not holding my breath!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed playing solitaire. It keeps my mind focused n calm. It's good to play when one is waiting for an spot or traveling by public transportation.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|This game is pretty, but starting from the initial menu screen, the text is garbled or completely missing. The initial screen had &quot;Options&quot; and &quot;About&quot; but no &quot;Play&quot;! Got it to work by tapping where it looked like &quot;Play&quot; should be, but all the dialogue between scenes was garbled, cut off, and unreadable. In-game, the score was always readable; but when it came to the upgrade menu, there was almost no text at all, which was a killer. Vizio VTAB1008.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Im glad Twitter finally has a real app out on the Kindle Fire now. Its so much better than going to the mobile web version.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Yup, force closes on my thunderbolt. Despite the other reviews, thought maybe I'd get lucky, but nope. Really would have liked to try it, the people it doesn't FC on seem to like it. Fix it and FAOTD again and I'll give it a try.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|...as I would not have had enough at the end of one. Actually come to think of it I would like another five please! This is such a well written story in a genre that can often be so hit and miss. It is fantastic when you take a punt on something self published and it is actually really, really worthwhile. The story line moves at a cracking pace, I genuinely couldn't guess what came next and was often surprised. The characters were likable and the new take on an old theme was truly original. Buy this book, I highly doubt you'll regret it.
0385344228|5.0|As someone who watches a lot of true crime television (Dateline, 48 hours, etc.) I often try to put myself in the shoes of the jury and determine whether or not I could state a defendant's guilt or innocence beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I did the same throughout this novel, although I found myself putting myself in the shoes of the parents most often.  I waffled back and forth between the \\"did he/didn't he\\" question and loved every minute of trying to figure it all out.  The question of a murder gene, brought to life through modern science was an interesting Frankenstein-like twist and definitely added another level to my thinking.  This was a true page-turner and one that has left me thinking about it and revisiting thoughts and questions about the case, the characters, and the conclusion.  This would be a great pic for book clubs and anyone interested in courtroom and/or family dramas!  One of the best books I've read lately!
B0052U59F4|5.0|Summary:<br />Anastasia Steele gets coerced into giving an interview by her roommate. The subject is none other than successful, young, entrepreneur Christian Grey. When they meet, Ana feels completely insecure and intimidated by Christian. There are some intense moments during the interview and Ana is convinced she will never see this man again.<br /><br />Then, Christian shows up at the shop she works at and makes arrangements for her to get photos to compliment the interview. Ana is completely blown away and so excited to see him again. After the photo shoot, neither one of them can seem to stop thinking about each other.<br /><br />As their relationship develops, Ana learns about Christian's unique sexual preferences and lifestyle. She's not sure she can accept the arrangement as Christian wants it. Their sexual relationship is definitely explosive, but Ana is looking for a deeper commitment from Christian. Based on his dark past, Christian is unsure that he can commit to Ana in the way she wants. Ana is falling for Christian and must decide if what he can give her will be enough or if she needs to let go.<br /><br />My Take:<br />There are simply not enough words for me to explain how much I loved this book. I kept seeing the book around and the rave reviews. Admittedly, I wasn't sure I would be able to get past his sexual preferences in order to enjoy it. I was worried it be like reading porn. Don't get me wrong, I read erotica and love reading good sex, but some things are a bit foreign to me. LOL!!! Let me say that this is absolutely a LOVE STORY! In fact, I will be as bold to say that this series has moved up to an all-time favorite status for me.<br /><br />I love how their relationship develops. Yes, he is this big millionaire, but the connection is so real that you feel like you are hearing a true story about how a couple met. I adore Ana and her initial innocence. I admire the fact that even after she is forced to make a decision, she stands by her feelings and isn't afraid to say it. On to Christian. When I think about Christian, all I can do is smile and get a tingly feeling all over! He's arrogant, complicated, manipulative, absolutely adorable, sensitive, loving, thoughtful, and possibly the sexiest man I've ever read about!<br /><br />The sex was steamy and exactly what I like to see in an erotic novel. It wasn't degrading; it was hot and loving. This series is actually hard for me to review, because I just can't describe how this series has personally affected me. I loved it so much that I read all three books within three days! If you haven't read this book, please give it a chance. This novel is one of the best and most beautiful love stories I have EVER read! I haven't stopped thinking about it since. Definite re-read!<br />[...]hristian.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been much more consistent with my Bible reading since getting this app. I love the reading program. another great feature is the ability to read from many different versions of the Bible.

0307956350|4.0|To call this novel a \\"spy thriller\\" is not exactly true. It is the story of Kate, who used to be in the CIA, but who is now married with two sons living in Luxembourg as an \\"Expat.\\" The plot is driven by a series of secrets- Kate never told her husband about working for the CIA, and it becomes increasingly clear that he is hiding something big from her too. To top it off, another American couple wants to spend a lot of time with them- and with her skills, Kate soon figures out that they are both FBI. What are they trying to find out?<br /><br />This first effort by Chris Pavone is strong on plotting, with plenty of clever twists at the end. In terms of character development it is not as deep, but even so it is worth reading. Pavone has potential and it will be interesting to see where he goes from here!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is the best.  It adds protection but is very thin.  I like to carry my kindle in my purse and most of the covers are too thick.  Love the pink!
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Bob Dylan's music is always better with him singing it. This is an enjoyable album, but a few of the performances don't do justice to Dylan's work.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I love this film.  Its, amusing, light hearted, romantic, a feelgood film.  It's about two women from completely different backgrounds and two different continents, that switch homes for a holiday, to get away from their unlucky in love, lives.  Of course, it all gets intertwined and end up getting involved with each others lives and of course, even better.  A Happy ending ! My husband enjoyed it too.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I can't even review the app, as it crashes repeatedly. It haven't got it to work once  and after 5 attempts to play it, I give up. Thunderbolt

B000JLPMPS|5.0|Recently I bought the blu-ray of this film.  I had forgotten what a really excellent movie it is -- dramatically as well as visually.  I can see now how it deserved to win the academy award for best picture.  I  noticed that it was photographed using Panavision equipment.  I certainly hope the Panavision corporation is able to resolve its current financial difficulties.  I would hate to see the loss of a corporation that contributed so much to the technical excellence of motion pictures.
B000026FJ6|5.0|I've bought about 5 copies of this disk over the years because everyone that hears it loves it so I give it to them. There is a music video associated with this which can be seen on you-tube I think.. it's worth watching. Just a wonderful disk, I'd call it \\"audio Feng shui\\" for lack of a better term...
B0064O927I|4.0|Trying to figure this watch out and setting it up takes a lot of patience. The instructions are provided in fifteen languages, from Arabic to Turkish, are very minimal and difficult to understand. The key to setting up the Touch is, as the instructions point out, \\"wear the watch on your wrist or touch the battery cover.\\" If you try to set it up by holding it in your hand, you'll end up very frustrated because it is either unresponsive, or overly responsive. At one point, I almost gave up and thought about returning it.<br /><br />The better method to learning about the Touch is to view their online tutorial. Once you run through that process, you'll find the Swatch Touch is actually a pretty cool watch. It has two time settings, date, chronograph, alarm, timer, and \\"beep\\" setting. It also has a very nice backlight feature for viewing in the dark. What I really like is how comfortable it is on the wrist. I've been looking for something less bulky that doesn't shift around on my wrist, and this watch solves the problem. The rubber wristband is soft and flexible, and the watch itself is shaped to better sit on the wrist.<br /><br />This is the first Swatch that I have purchased, but I'm sold on their watches. I only rated the Touch four stars though because of the poor instructions and the hassle of learning how to set it up. Overall though, I'm highly pleased with the Swatch Touch.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Wow...there are so many ads!  They just pop up whenever and frequently.<br /><br />Some of the control in the games is inaccurate and some games it is just your own finger that limits your view (such as one of the first games with the bubbles and fish).<br /><br />If you have nothing to do and just want to pass the time then this free app is ok.
B0053O89RY|5.0|We heard good things about this series but had never watched it. Saw it on special on Amazon and took a chance with the first two seasons. Really very entertaining and a comical look at life in the 10's.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This was super fun and I played it almost through in one night (way past bedtime for sure!).  This game provides challenge and tests your recollection of where things are.  The story and graphics were really nice.<br /><br />The only thing I would have liked were more puzzles.  Addition of more skilled thinking and problem solving would have resulted in the highest rating.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I sleep far less than most, so I often play games and watch movies at odd times, so I've used several other wireless headphones in the past.  That being said, they haven't lived up to my expectations (hiss and limited fidelity), then I ran into these.  Having read positive reviews and wanting to get some variant of surround sound, I took the plunge.  I've yet to find a fault with these headphones.<br />Setup was easy (if you ignore the 360's issues with optical audio out and HDMI out), and everything has sounded great since then.  Surround effects are good, but not great.  Range is certainly adequate (never pushed it that far), lag isn't an issue, and as for the microphone/chat, I've yet to use it.  It probably works well.  Perhaps most importantly, they feel great on my (rather large) head.  They are lightweight and simply comfortable.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is by one of the best free apps given, awesome story, music, sound effects and colors. These app must be rated on quality, not if they crash on your crappy phones, there played on kindle fires so ignore the 1 star trolls....
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|this game is hard but I like.how they made it HD!!!!I think it's impossible to beat the creepy alien!!!!!I think it's cool how they took this old fashioned game to new!!!!
B005RUV714|1.0|The first season rocked and the second season sucks! I bought the second season on Amazon but have lost interest due to the lack of zombie presence. The second season does not have the raw grit, and attraction that the first season had that kept me staying up late to watch. I hope the producers fix this soon before I just give up on the walking dead completely. This show is more like a slow soap opera on a farm than a zombie movie classic that it was on track to become.
B005HSL626|5.0|it is such a FUN app!!!!u should get it I love this app!!!! so much fun but is hard to unlock blades.my brother unlocked like all of the blades in a week!!!!I don't know how he does it!!!!Even my parents enjoy this app!!!!
B0068AWQQ2|1.0|Colin is a solid actor so I do not blame him for his bad acting in this film. I understand he was supposed to be a cute, sexy and hip vampire but he came across as super cheesy. And being a fan of the one with Chris Sarandon, I did not like this one. It did not do justice to the original.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've got the whole family playing angry birds!!!!!even my grandparents!!!!I love,they love we're all happy!!!!actually angry when we can't beat a level!!!!:)
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|This movie did a good job as a prequel to the first classic. I was very concerned they would mess this film up but they did a nice job setting the stage for Carpenter's classic Thing. I bought this one.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I think this going to make a better movie than it did a book, and I've never had that thought before. This was a great draft of a book that could have been very good, but these charactors lack depth. I don't understand how his is getting so many five star ratings. I didn't hate it, but it I just didn't feel any suspense or high emotion, especially considering the gravity of the situation Katniss was in. A lot of untapped potential here. Decent story, bad writing.
B006QKKMBA|3.0|I was surprised that I liked this one in the series. I did not find it as cheesy as the others nor did the actors get on my last nerve. They did a good job on this one. I would recommend it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Got this on my Kindle Fire a few days ago, and I really like it. Nice layout and options, and more detail than the pre-loaded Weather Channel app. No issues at all loading or using this app. Well done, AccuWeather!

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|This is a pretty good 80's style arcade shooter.  Bright colors, it looks nice and has a good bit of 80's related humor thrown in.  TONS of upgrades are available for your guns and ship.  I DO wish I could control the firing of the gun (it's auto-fire) but don't know how it would be possible with the current control configuration of the game.<br /><br />It is definitely a good game though, worth checking out.  It plays and looks great on my kindle fire.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Force close on G-Nexus. Wish I could play this game, loved it when I was younger. Do not even bother folks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very good game for aneroid highly recommend it and it will keep you entertained.  works very well with the kindle fire.

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I have three Android devices I tested Radiant HD.<br /><br />1) HTC Flyer - worked<br />2) Samsung Galaxy Player 5.0 - worked<br />3) Samsung Galaxy S 2 - force close<br /><br />They explain that this app is only for certain devices so your Android phone might not be able to play the app.  If you can get Radiant HD today as the FAOTD, go ahead and try it.  Later on, try the free app first to make sure it doesn't FC on your device.<br /><br />I like this game.  The ship auto fires, so you only have to worry about the controls.  You move left by touching the left side of the screen and move right by touching the right side of the screen.  I've had problems with apps that are too complicated to use on a touchscreen without a joystick.  I think this simple approach works well with this game.<br /><br />I've played it on a 7\\" and 5\\" tablet and found the ship to move smoothly across the screen.  The graphics are very bright and colorful.  The retro feel of Radiant HD is a nice change of pace from the typical Android game.
B0000A118M|5.0|Relatively speaking, I'm new to Jazz artists.  I've always loved the sound but never bothered to find out the different styles, much less the artists.  I'm so very happy with this CD and thank Amazon for making it available to me, quickly and packaged perfectly.  Couldn't ask for more.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having different versions of the Bible at hand no matter where I am. great for on the go studying.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|A friend of mine gave me this album and buyers BEWARE! When there are only 5 songs on the album which are on rotation on the radio and as videos then there is a problem. Beyonce yelled her way through this albumand enough is enough. Artist today really need to realease single instead of albums. Placing twelve songs on an album and 5 out of the 12 are released then something is wrong. The music industry is suffering because of stuff like this. Artist should release singles and call it a day because their albums are all fluff and no stuff. The music industry became greedy and people are very observant to the lack luster quality of work today. Beyonce's voice annoyed me and I will definitely toss this is the garbage!
0425166805|5.0|8:27 PM 2/25/2012<br />  My guess is many readers have taken made remarks regarding anyone who errs with a keystroke or has spelling issues similar to one I read regarding a mere mis-keyed attempt at a word \\"pseudo-science.\\" In some odd way we allow our reason to install a false fuel to a fire leading to a distrust in the message one may have. It isn't important to agree with the author or not, simply his belief. With that out of the way this should not diminish my message in value either. The only other demeaning method to trivialize a subject is employment of a less than flattering title such as \\"ancient aliens.\\" I have a real problem with that in so far as I believe in the Heart of Erich Von Daniken and feel his educational experiences were beyond astounding and so unique that my admiration of him is so far beyond the demeaning term above that it saddens me greatly. It makes me feel as I could only imagine an airline pilot witnessing an absolute close encounter but is afraid of the stigma attached to the dreaded UFO acronym! I wonder if I had tried, could I have just translated Bible's from Hebrew into Greek or Greek into English and doggone it I am part Greek.<br />  But there are three tidbits of info I wish to consider in as far as adding to \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" as an absolutely incredible coincidence and as much so as Nazca and the Easter Islands: It requires thinking outside the box upon all your academic knowledge to rationalize how events might unfold in ways you had not thought of before.<br /> 1. Divine intervention fits all of Erich Von Daniken's theories as if hand in a glove and don't think for a minute Natural Selection and Origin of the Species does not fit equally as well - it does. I think most people fixate on an Ape and shut down their Gray Matter.<br /> 2. Aliens that traverse space is a mind boggling idea due to the huge distances to travel for without a worm hole for instance I believe I once did a rough calculation in my head for what it would require to travel 4 light years to our nearest neighboring star using present day rockets and propulsion systems. It is not the distance in so much as you really have to start thing in terms of HOW MANY GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES AND OFFSPRING ARE REQUIRED ON BOARD TO MAKE SUCH A FLIGHT - Seriously I want to say it came close to 20 or 30 generations of offspring to get there. Do you realize what even if I'm off by a factor of 2 that means 10, 12, or 15 roughly. To me that is so impossible to plan such an event that who would want to and what size craft would that take? Aliens may have worm holes but if not they better have some type of \\"equivalency to a particle accelerator in the form of a HUGE spaceship at 99.9% light speed!\\"<br />3. We live in a star system that with imagination, you can date the Sun and Earth as you would a person's birthday. Simply instead of a 1 year orbit for Earth, the Sun has an approximate 250 Million Year revolution. What does this mean...in Galactic Years, the Sun and the Earth have just had a birthday and we are 18 G.Years old. Also the first 16 G.Years were quite bad here. It may have well been all that you see on Mars and Venus in combination over that Hadean & Archaen period before the Sweet sixteen came and the Oceans (not Land) exploded with life called the Cambrian. Most of us know about the theories behind the extinctions and I think we have had 6 altogether with 2 Majore ELE's! One due to a sick planet with a mountainous asteroid to add an exclamation point. The first is still an enigma for it was the worst one ever killing 90% of all the Cambrian life that had been in the oceans. Some think we were hit by the Polar end of a Supernova Gamma Ray and others may have found evidence of an off shore crater NW of Australia's coastline. The point is a Galactayear is nothing short of a roller coaster ride thru Dust ( and when astronomers refer to dust, I have learned they mean not just vacuum type variety but rather particles the sizes of asteroids and even planets - it is not a hold your hands up in to last car ride around the tracks!!! The Sun's path is not even straight up and down ride either - rather imagine a stretched out  \\"Slinky\\" coil that dips and rises up and down thru the galactic plane over and over as if it did a twisted version of a roller coaster ride in its stretched out slinky with our North Pole wobbling from Polaris then to Vega then back to Polaris again over and over.( its angular longitudinal motion is smaller from the inward - outward SGA* drag motion with the latitudinal up and down traversing being rather large (to us) yet still a disc inhabitant. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? Aliens do not need long travels because it is very probable we frequent their home spatial areas quite often during these passes that we call out Axial Wobble that is analagous to one Wavelength of Motion looking at it as a Side view forgetting the in-to-out motion that makes a coil. It is one long gigantic radio like wavelength from one peak to the next. This fact leads to thousands of chance encounter with new \\"friends\\" that may be under the disc or in the disc or some where close while we move...........The most bizarre event that has ever happened that we know of took place between 30 and 50 million years ago (especially rare is a Type IA Supernova that we never expect to see Type II's such as the marvelous event witnessed in 1987 and has had many beautiful Hubble pictures since, but that was a SuperNova that most Astronomer's never believe to capture in a lifetime. (We know the one prior to this was the Crab Nebula in 1054 A.D. but that is it). These are Huge Stars of such size that their fused CORES are so large at implosion the entire fused portion of the star although not known is known to have a mass equal to 1.4 SUNS so the diameter may be 3/4 the width of our Sun or may be as big as our Sun is now JUST at its center! However an Astronomer named GOULD in the 1800's noticed and catalogued a uniqueBelt of Stars that had obviously formed from new nebulous clouds if density that resulted from as many as 20 or 30 SuperNovas going off inside of a 10 to 20 million year period sweeping debris and dust lanes right out of the way and simple clearing a nice little path or BUBBLE to the delight of the Star passing thru! This is the epic of all ironies not supposed to happen with so many and so often and so close in proximity as if if were meant to be! Any one person who reads Chariot of the God's needs to look this up ( Gould's Belt) and brush up on your astronomy. If the term \\"ancient aliens\\" is to apply, you really should never comment on the subject unless you have exhausted every subject that could be related. This much of Science and History I do know is how to test a theory or hypothesis must be controlled and conclusions are worthless unless you've exhausted all possible informational data by your research. Don't you think Erich Von Dankien did that very thing! I must say that a volume of COINCIDENTAL celestial events have happened which are so diverse including all of science that it would go far beyond the prototypical forensic detective to not have probable cause in light of all these factual links. We exist not as a static Solar System but a very active moving sphere that is enveloped to way beyond the Keiper Belt to include a trillion or more icy bodies known as Oort Cloud Objects. It is perhaps the reason we have Oceans on Earth. Gould's Belt is a 3 dimensional bubble and not a Belt except in appearance as it can be seen in a circular plane just above our \\"lane around the track\\" (the Orion Spur) and it is angled with a slight upward ascent nearly 20 degrees to form a bullseye if you will. These all too rare explosions gave to us during our last little approach to birthday Number 18 by having cleared the inner volume of the belt's bubble where SAFE TRAVELING is tantamount to a brand new highway opening. Of all the some 300 extra-solar systems found in a decade, only<br />one happens to be enjoying the nice and relatively free cometary and asteroidal shooting gallery left by this one in a trillion Gould's coincidence. And if it were not enough to be hitting part of the Bubble - nope - we get a Bulls-eye straight on shot straight down the middle. In the words of a University of Chicago Professor; \\"It is certainly convenient to have the evolutionary trek occur of humans and this event all at the same time!\\" There are only so many events that can occur without it being any other answer than perhaps one a Naturalist may not care for. But for me, I believe in both Natural Science as it is taught today with the open mindedness to believe Divine intervention has given us a little push....People need to do themselves the favor of never shutting off to avoid thinking outside the box. (and if a great man list were to be published including all fields, Erich would be on my list with Darwin, Einstein, Newton, Da Vinci, Keppler, Bohr, Hubble, Shakespeare, Bach, Galileo, Plato, Aristotle, and those who carried messages undoubtedly more profoundly substantive than the great list above are the greatest of all: for in the days of communication limits, God led his sons applying their gift to teach, to reach, to enlighten, to love, to simply care less about your own needs than the needs of others not because you have an agenda, but because your heart has lead your actions to do this - such were the Divine powers given to Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha and that list is shorter than it should be yet very few were given this gift.<br />  We enjoy this short gift of life here on Earth by heart felt application of these gifts to educate<br />ourselves to be better humans at our ending than we were at our beginning. Never forget that life<br />flourished TWO Laps before our enjoyment of this most recent pie slice of this last 1/8th turn for<br />the mere accomplishment of our 20th \\"birthday of being a Solar System if you wish to call it\\" where<br />those Twenty revolutions took up 4.56 Billion Years of History of our 8 planets and we need to<br />cherish the gifts God gave to our beloved teachers till the day we become once more<br />ash and dust as we started and our soul to travel back to our creator; a soul forever linked to our<br />hearts we hopefully display as we were taught, not by hypothesis proved inside a lab, but by<br />what God really wants - to accept it blindly on faith alone.<br />Zack Manos
B0055CJ8T2|1.0|This album sucks because Kelly is trying to be a sex symbol in order to sell an album. She is going to be just like Ciara with that bumping and grinding mess. I feel bad for artist now because they are too busy trying to be sexy instead of singing the song. This is where I have to say I will always listen to artist with strong vocals like Aretha, Whitney, Patti LaBelle, etc. because if music like this keeps going then music will surely die!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|tried to run it three times. crashed on open all three. amazon apostles doesn't even see it installed. no stars. too bad. looks like fun.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Read with interest the reviews, especially some of the lower ratings.  Installed the application for the trial period. Within 10 minutes I told my wife that this app has got some bad reviews because it is a bit complicated and some don't want to spend the time to learn its ins and outs.<br />Well that is my take.  If you want something simple get a different app. But if you like a lot of data and are willing to allow some time to learn the thing, this is it. After 30 days of use this is my primary weather app. Not perfect, but a very useful application for me.
B004SDEP38|5.0|I use this app for editing spreadsheets for work. I have an Evo 4G and this app was exactly what I needed. The menus were a little confusing for me at first but once I figured things out it was smooth sailing. I have not tried any other Office style apps for my phone but I see no need to. The pinch zoom makes editing cells a snap. I wouldn't want to spent all day using this app but for simple things like end of day work reports or minor tweaking of documents this app is perfect for that. I recently tried the new Google Doc's android app. not nearly as smooth or easy to use as Documents To Go.
0817439390|5.0|I love love this book.  Before I got my first DSLR I bought this book. I love his writing style and his photos are awesome, so there is a ton of eye candy as you're learning.  It was very easy to follow the exercises  provided.  It really helped me a ton when it came to learning my new camera.
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|It's been awhile now since I read this book, but I cannot get its badness out of my mind.  The Kindle free chapter was decent, so I bought the book expecting more of the same--what a mistake that was!  For anyone who downloads the freebie and likes it, beware.  I am hoping this is not a new marketing trick, write a coherent first chapter to hook the Kindle readers then the h*ll with the rest of it once the sale is made...<br /><br />\\"Let the Great World Spin\\" is juvenile and pretentious--does anyone over the age of nineteen or so still think hookers and other assorted lowlifes are a sophisticated and interesting subject?  Well, evidently the guy who wrote this book does.<br /><br />This thing loves itself desperately, I did not share that love as I read it and still feel shame that I was stupid enough to buy it.  Yet, having already squandered my hard earned money, I did slog through to the end, god knows how, but I did, and I am ashamed about that, too, the hours of my life I will never get back...<br /><br />So, for anyone who feels an overwhelming need to read this embarrassing mess, do yourself and your wallet a favor and borrow it from your local library.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I am not a Big Woody Allen fan, so I was skeptical about this movie. It is wonderful! He has captured Paris in the early 1900s, made a truly Romantic comedy for all to enjoy. BRAVO Woody Allen, BRAVO!!!!<br />Thank you for doing this!
B005C0DHEY|2.0|The narrator was mumbling and trying to either sound dramatic, mysterious, or sexy. Failed on all accounts. I got about halfway through it and couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />Speak CLEARLY and ENUNCIATE next time. Please. For the sake of your movie/cause. I kept thinking this was a college project or a long commercial spot. We know you don't normally speak like that because you talk perfectly fine while interviewing people.<br /><br />And just to be clear, I am definitely *not* pro-fracking. I'm glad this movie got made. Just wish I was deaf while watching it.<br /><br />Rant over, go ahead and speak your peace.
B005ELZKWS|1.0|I don't get what makes this album fun, rocking or endearing. Joe is a great guitarist, but he's plays nothing intriguing. Hagar sounds bland, like he's just there to cash a check. Michael Anthony was great in VH, but doesn't seem to matter here. The whole thing is sadly mediocre at best. What a waste of a decent band.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|So I got this app on my kindle fire,and does not even work. Every time I try to download the extra information it does not work!!!
1400064627|5.0|This story begins in the 1980s with two women who meet in the waiting room  at the Rose Terrace Nursing Home in Birmingham, Alabama. Mrs.Ninny(Virginia) Threadgoode is a wise and charming lady who resides in the nursing home.  Evelyn Couch is a middle-aged woman, who comes weekly with her husband to visit her mother-in-law, Big Momma. She doesn't have very much patience with her mother-in-law and so she leaves and goes to the waiting room.  It is there that she meets Mrs. Threadgoode.<br /><br />Mrs. Threadgoode begins by going back in time and tells Evelyn about her life in the 1930s in Whistle Stop, Alabama, where they have one cafe named The Whistle Stop Cafe, one convenience store and one Bulletin called The Weems Weekly written by Dot Weems.<br /><br />Evelyn, at first, is not interested in listening to Mrs. Threadgoode's life history, as she has her own problems.  She is in her mid-forties, overweight and generally unhappy with her life.  She is very naive and not able to adapt to the changes in life. One would say that she is stuck in time and old-fashioned.  She is also bored and can't seem to fit in.  Because she is so miserable, she uses food as a way of coping.  She fills up on chocolate bars, ice cream and of course, gains more weight.<br /><br />Every week, Mrs. Threadgoode continues with her story back in Whistle Stop and Evelyn is beginning to show interest.  She tells her about The Whistle Stop Cafe, where all the folks meet aand talk about the goings-on in the town.  The Cafe is owned and run by two women, Idgie and her best friend, Ruth.  The cooking is done by two black women and Big George makes the barbecue.  This is rare with racism going on in the South.  Some of the Southern foods served are simply \\"to die for\\" like fried catfish, fried green tomatoes, dumplings, black-eyed peas, cobbler and grits, just to name a few.  There are recipes in the back of the book, which gives the book a nice touch.  It also adds to the book's southern flavor and gives it a homey feeling.<br /><br />Idgie is a tomboy, who likes to dress masculine and play practical jokes. One day at the Baptist Church, she puts poker chips in the collection box.  Both she and Ruth are their in thirties.  They are very close friends and some may say they have an intimate relationship.  The door at The Whistle Stop Cafe is opened to everyone from black people, hobos and the poor.  Only one thing, black folks have to enter through the kitchen door in the back or the Cafe would be burned to the ground by the KKK.<br /><br />There are excerpts from The Weems Weekly Bulletin over each chapter that has to do with Whistle Stop.  The paper gives the town folks all the latest news.<br /><br />With Evelyn's weekly visits and listening to Mrs. Threadgoode continue with her uplifting stories about her life, Evelyn's spirits improve.  She starts to make changes in her life, beginning with losing weight.  She is now filled with hope for the future.<br /><br />This novel has a lot to do with race relations in the South, homosexuality,<br />domestic abuse, an unsolved murder and aging. On the other hand, it is filled with strong friendships, fun times and  acceptance of people.<br /><br />Fannie Flagg is a Southern born gifted storyteller, whose books will lift your spirits with her quirky and lovable characters.  You will laugh a little, cry a little, but her book will keep you entertained from beginning to end.  This book is a WINNER.<br /><br />P,S.  If you enjoyed this book, you will also like Can't Wait To Get To Heaven.gives it a homey feeling.<br /><br />Idgie is a tomboy, who likes to dress masculine and play practical jokes.

B005LAIGZU|4.0|There may be spoilers.<br /><br />From what I've read co-directors Mike McCoy and Scott Waugh were given uncommon access to military knowhow and technology, specifically the U. S. Navy SEALs.  Their original goal was to produce a quasi-documentary/recruiting film.  That evolved into a full length commercial film.  From that perspective I suspect they hit their mark.  There are some unusual aspects to this movie.  With some obvious exceptions, the primary cast is made up of real life active SEALs.  It is pretty clear they are not actors but I'm inclined to give them plenty of slack in that area.  I doubt real actors could have delivered some of the combat lingo and battle maneuvers like the real deal either.<br /><br />SEAL Team 7 is assigned a mission to rescue a kidnapped CIA agent (Roselyn Sanchez, TV's \\"Without a Trace\\") from terrorists located in Costa Rica.  She had been close to uncovering a jihadist plot to infiltrate the U. S. from Mexico.  In a bit of a sticking point, prior to their departure the filmmakers spend an unusual amount of time showing the men with their families so that we know they are just regular guys.  They have wives and kids.  You know just guys no different than any other neighbor.  It was a little much.<br /><br />What isn't overdone are the action sequences.  They are absolutely thrilling.  I was especially taken with the initial mission to rescue Agent Morales (Sanchez).  This involved parachuting in at night, navigating through the jungle and swamp and taking out the capturers with machine-like precision.  The first-person-video-game-like helmet-cam brought a snicker at first but it isn't overdone.  In a heart-pounding escape, the team is overwhelmed with bad guys, but is also aided by swift boats dropped into the river by huge helicopters.  So cool.  The bad guys have some big guns, but so does the Navy and they know how to use them.  Subsequently, a retrieved Blackberry leads the commanders to uncover details about the bigger plot.<br /><br />Working with a Russian smuggler, a Chechnya terrorist has lined up 16 Philippine suicide bombers to wear vests filled with explosive ceramic ball bearings and ignite them in various U. S. cities.  As the mission continues, the SEAL Team takes out half the terrorists in one location but must move near the U. S. border in Mexicali to prevent the remainder from tunneling in under the protection of the local drug cartel.  Working with their Mexican counterparts this final battle will have many casualties including some good guys.  I must admit I loved the action sequences in this movie, but the screenplay is a clunker.  Frankly it is irrelevant.  This is the best military recruiting film since \\"Top Gun\\" and even with its flaws is worth seeing.<br /><br />BLU RAY UPDATE (6-10-14)<br /><br />This second viewing on Blu ray provides reinforcement on some of my initial comments.  The film purposely is one-sided but I knew that from the beginning.  And I have to say, the best part are the action sequences, especially the first rescue of the captured CIA officer.  As the bad guys are about to outgun the escaping SEALs, they run into 2 swift boats armed with .50 cal. machine guns.  Game over.  Regardless of one's political beliefs, this is an adrenaline inducing scene.  On to the Blu ray disc itself.<br /><br />The video has a 1080p resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Using small digital cameras, the filmmaker's you-are-there feel comes across beautifully in this transfer.  Colors and skin tones are perfect.  Jungle greens and desert tans come across accurately.  In some of the night sequences, you might find a bit of visual noise but it's not distracting.  With a non-stop action flick like this you would hope to get a solid audio track.  And boy do you.  It comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and it's a stunner.  The viewer is caught in the middle of the constant action sequences and the sound onslaught is everywhere.  Surprisingly, at least to me, the film has anexcellent musical score thanks to Nathan Furst and it plays well when the scenes call for it.  Top shelf, demo quality audio.

1439153663|5.0|Kathleen Grissom opens the novel with a horrific prologue and then goes back ten years to recount the events leading up to the prologue.<br /><br />The story begins in 1791 and is told by the two main characters, Lavinia and Belle in alternating chapters.<br /><br />Two Irish immigrants die on their journey from Ireland to America on the ship that is owned by Captain James Pyke.  He is also the Captain of the ship.  They leave behind two children, a son, Cardigan and a daughter, Lavinia.  Because their parents didn't pay their passage, the children are separated.  Cardigan is easy to place and is sold and sent to another city to work as a slave, while Lavinia, who is almost seven years old , sick, frail and scared to death is taken by the Captain and is handed over to Belle on the Tall Oaks tobacco plantation in Southern Virginia, which he owns.<br /><br />Belle is the illegitimate half-white daughter of the Captain and she runs the Kitchen House, which is considered to be a place of privilege on the plantation.<br /><br />For seven years of her life, Belle is raised by her grandmother,the Captain's mother, in the BIG HOUSE. Her white grandmother accepts Belle as her granddaughter and teaches her everything, just like a white girl.  She learns how to read, write and how to behave.  Their relationship is one of love for each other.  Then one day her grandmother dies suddenly.  Belle is shocked and takes the death badly.<br /><br />Captain Pyke has never married and one day decides to bring home a young wife named Martha, who is twenty years to his forty years.  Belle is then evicted from his home.  She moves to the Kitchen House, because he doesn't want his young wife to know.  The Captain is absent most of the time and his young wife has to oversee the plantation.  He and his wife, Miss Martha have two children, Marshall and Sally.  Marshall grows up to be an alcoholic and violent man, who causes turmoil wherever he goes.<br /><br />Some of the people living in the Kitchen House are Mama Mae, the matriarch, Papa George, the patriarch, their children, Uncle Jacob and Ben.  Mama Mae is in charge of the women slaves.  She teaches Belle how to cook and now, Belle presides over the Kitchen House and cooks for the Big House.  Belle loves Mama Mae and Papa George. She would rather stay at the place she calls home than accept the \\"Freedom Papers\\".  Belle is now a beautiful eighteen year old woman to whom the Captain pays visits and gives her small gifts.<br /><br />There is also Rankin, an employee, who when the Captain is away, sees an opportunity to run the plantation the way he sees fit.  He makes life miserable for everyone.  He is cruel, a heartless drunk and brings trouble wherever he goes.<br /><br />Lavinia is nursed back to health and is treated with kindness and concern by Mama Mae, Papa George and Belle.  Lavinia, also known as Abinia, becomes close to the slaves, while working in the Kitchen House.  She can't quite fit in, because she is white. But with time she grows to love the people and considers them her adopted family.<br /><br />Eventually, Lavinia is accepted into the BIG HOUSE.  The Master is always absent and Miss Martha struggles with opium addiction and requires the help of Lavinia.  Lavinia, who has her own problems of where her loyalties lie, is forced to make a big decision that can ultimately change her life.<br /><br />The book is filled with twists and turns.  There are secrets, births, deaths, drug and alcohol abuse, beatings and more.<br /><br />The book is well-written, fast paced and full of action.<br /><br />Kathleen Grissom explores the world of Slavery and also the world of White Slavery of which very little is known.<br /><br />This debut book is a HUGE SUCCESS and I can Highly recommend it.Kitchen House are Mama Mae, the matriarch, Papa George, the patriarch, their children, Uncle Jacob and Ben.

B0071MV540|3.0|The movie Tower Heist was a slow beginning. It just seemed like it kept dragging on and on. By the middle of the movie, it began to pick up. There were parts that were very funny. I was expecting this to be a really great movie; especially with the set of actors that was picked for this movie. Unfortunately, I was let down.<br /><br />I gave a 3 star; because it was an ok movie. Not really bad, but not really good.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It took forever for the update to appear on the appstore but this plays beautifully on the Galaxy Nexus. Well worth the  wait.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|too bad. this app looked nice, but it won't even leave the starting gate on a DROID Bionic. It crashes right away.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this on my iphone &amp; now I can play on a bigger screen on my kindle. Great way to pass time while hubs watches sports!!
1612130283|5.0|Let's get straight to the point: this book is kinky. So if you don't like erotic reads, you wont like it. But if you don't mind them either way, you will find that the love story in this book, MAKES the book! It's not about the kink, it really isn't. Yes, it is part of the story, but if you skip the very detailed details, you will realize that THOSE don't really matter. What matter are the characters.<br /> The characters are so well developed, they pull you in! You can't put the book down!! And it's not just about this one book, it is all 3 books and my advice is you read all three! (I read the second one in 2 days!)I loved every single page! I have laughed, cried, and so much more.<br />No, it is not Shakespeare! But it is well written, unpretentious. A fabulous story! Highly original? probably not. But worth every penny!!!<br />Enjoy!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|love this app. it keeps me organized. it is a 'must have' for any blogger, artistic type, or anyone with multiple electronics. it is visually stimulating. besides, who can beat free??
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I didn't believe this would make a huge difference when I listened to my music but to my surprise it did. I have used my Sony MDR-V6 and Ultrasone 680s with it and they both sound even more amazing. I'm using a current Gen Macbook Air (2011). I went to the Audio set up and I noticed something interesting though the highest settings for this DAC is 48K Hz and 2Ch 16Bit Audio. don't get me wrong, it still sounds great but I will be upgrading to the E17 when it is released since I believe the settings (specs) for it state that it does 192K Hz and 24Bit Audio. the other thing I like about this DAC is that at least on MACs you just plug it in and it works right away, you just have to change your output source.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|nice idea love the options. all the games are fun and can take some problem solving. can not wait to see what's next.
B0071QIN00|2.0|I first though the game was fun. but when it came to level 14 i got really frustrated because the obstacles were really hard to pass and the &quot;remotes&quot; as in the forward, back, and stop buttons are really uncoordinated. overall i lost interest in the game.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I read Matched a while ago and I LOVED IT! I couldn't wait to get the sequel. The first chapter was kind of a warning sign for me. All of a sudden Cassia was in some work camp, and Ky was burying dead bodies. It was CONFUSING!! It's like the author didn't say what went on between book one & book 2. As I read on, it was very anti-climactic and stuff would just happen for no reason. Characters and places would be talked about like they were there all along but were never even introduced. Long story short, I was very disapointed and didn't even bother finishing the book. A weak sequel. I will not read any more of this series...
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|this app is great! it works well, easy to use and has a clean presentation.  it is probably the app I use more than any other
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's just klondike solitaire. no fanciness, no varieties....but yet strangely addicting. it helps to pass time without being something that takes forever to load or can't be put done and picked up quickly.
0385344228|5.0|Given the number of lawyers in our fair land who have become successful writers,<br />I wonder if the law school curriculum now includes courses on creative writing.  Guys like Grisham have an incredible gift in setting up plots heavy with psychological, social and courtroom themes.  Landay, whom I had not read previously, really scores with this one.<br />How tempting it must be for a relatively new novelist to linger too long with<br />descriptive language and explanations at the expense of exciting, tension-producing<br />momentum.  Landay does not fail us in this regard.  On the contrary, he displays<br />a truly sophisticated sense of timing without overburdening us with unnecessary details.<br />Parents who have reared or are rearing [God bless you all] a teenager will connect immediately with so many carefully wrought passages where it's all about temperament, electronic gadgets, mood swings and the like.  This adds lots of flavor to the narrative.<br />Marital discord is another area where the author excels. No cheesy daytime TV dialog here.  Instead we find carefully interwoven nuances in adult relationships, especially regarding Jacob's family.<br />In summary, I only wish those who write TV and movie scripts would take a cue from this novelist and produce something truly entertaining, even educational for a broad audience.  5 Stars well earned, in my view.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There isn't even a comparison on the market... my phone is my carry every where bible! the best part is I can switch translation in 2 seconds to clarify what I'm reading. Awesome app well done You version!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a horrid book the many hate. NOT. I loved this book so much! Can`t wait to read the second one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game for when your bored I like how you have to work to unlock more games. my son also loves to play to.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Dunno why so many reviews report issues with various Droids - this app runs fine on my Droid X.  As for the app, it's kind of fun and the story is amusing, but I can only see myself playing it on short bursts.  I was torn between three and four stars, but went with four because for what it is (a retro shooter), it's quite well done.
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|This movie was adorable and funny! I thought it would be worse but i loved it! It is definitely worth watching!! :)
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I was never a fan or Phantom Of The Opera. Unforgetable music and an amazing production but the story left me cold. The  sequel was released on bluray  in february  in Australia whilst the  stage show was still showing here. This  production  is absolutely breathtaking .A brilliant and flawless cast make this a show to see again and again.  The music was  hauntingly  beautiful  and unforgettable.Much better that the original Phantom as far as the story goes.It is  very very rare for me get so engrossed in a  show that I wanted to see it again immediately  after it finished. In an age of dismal musicals it is great to finally see one that  is amongst  the very best I have ever seen. The bluray quality  is  briliant.More extras would have been welcome.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|once again I'm happy. I looked for this game for months becuz I have it on my ipod and finally its here.it works great on my kindle with no freezing and amazing graphics so if you like farm story you will love this game too, along with fashion story and bakery story. have fun!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|Ever since hearing this band on Satellite Radio... I knew I wanted to buy the CD.<br />Amazon made that easy and cheap.<br /><br />The CD plays through for me like one track in that I enjoy each song.<br />Would definitely recommend this CD to others... XX is going to continue to spread until they are a household name.
0307959856|2.0|Marriage and domestic life have dulled Elizabeth and Darcy, thanks to P.D. James's ponderous sequel to Pride and Prejudice.  The novel is almost all authorial narration and very little dialogue.  The only character with any life is the odious Lydia.  The basic problem is that James cannot replicate the sparkle of Austen's vision nor can she interest the reader in the murder. Give this one a pass.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|This is a great movie.  Even better after you have seen it a few times.  I have recommended it to friends (non-Italians) and they too have enjoyed it.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|I have been a Bob Dylan fan for 40 years, I just love this album, so many great artists singing the legendary man's songs, recommended to people who may not be Dylan fans but who need to listen to the words of a legend sung by other people....and well done Pete Seeger....the world needs to stand and applaud your own legendary status
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Awesome! Something for all ages. Great story, voice acting was superb<br />and unbelievable editing. Great job Chris. Hope there is a sequel.
B004VMUS9G|1.0|it stinks. because. you can never turn it of and its is the worst game I have ever got I hope no one gets it no one it stinks:/
B0067Q42BY|4.0|fun and addicting. easy to use. can play for hours. like the twist of a story line. I love games with a adventure modes. this too many words to have to type for a review. you guys need to fix this because it is driving me nuts
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|The game looks and plays great. Highly recommended. The diverse weapons and their upgrades as well as the humor are highlights.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Wasn't even able to open the game due to it force closing. 1 star due to this but will rate later if I can open it. Thankfully it was free
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|overall I really have been enjoying this FAOTD.  There are plenty of old school jokes for those of us who remember the originals.  Plays great on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
0062082353|3.0|I wanted it to be better and kept waiting for it to be better. The book is Ok but nothing more. I'd buy it at a second hand store for $5 and be happy I bought it.<br /><br />Some interesting insights into the Seal life and how, despite the sacrifice and risk they endure, despite how quickly old they must grow in battle, how emotionally immature they really are back in the \\"world\\". Sadly it's changed from the greatest generation's attitude.<br /><br />Not much story development re the ops they were involved in.<br /><br />Overall, could have been better.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Won't open for me on my Galaxy s2 epic 4g touch. What's up guys? If I could open the program I might give you a better rating.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|It's a nice little film having the benefit of noteworthy actors starring in it. By no means Oscar worthy. George Clooney gave a better performance in `Up in the Air'.
0756404738|5.0|I love this book. Patrick Rothfuss does not disappoint. He is a wizard of words with a vivid imagination to match, Buy this book and be blown away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome it makes it hard but possible<br /> I suggest this game to any one. I give this game 5 star review
B0067Q42BY|3.0|So far, I like the game. The only problem is that I taken away from the game in order to do this review. I don't mind giving an update or review, but I was barely into the game when I was asked to give a review. I am not very far along yet. But from what I have played so far, it seems to be a good game. Maybe I will post another review when I am able to play it more. One thing, I didn't see a bunch of ads at the beginning of the game as others have stated in their reviews. Hopefully that won't be a problem.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|First of all, this game works awesome &amp; looks great on my Kindle Fire. Nothing was cut off on my screen.<br />Secondly, I completely agree with Glenn &amp; others who think that Brian McGrath (and other superman75 wanna-bees) reviews should just be banned from Amazon reviews bc they're pointless, inaccurate &amp; immature.<br />I would have only given this game a 3 or 4 Star review simply bc it's just not my cup of tea but I wanted to offset these pointless, inaccurate &amp; immature ratings &amp; reviews.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is pretty fun, its really fun for long car rides. the games though are not that fun. i wish the games were more addicting
B000002MUQ|3.0|I like this album a lot better than OU812 and slightly better than For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, but not nearly as much as 5150 (or anything from the Roth era).  What I like about this album, for the most part, is that while it isn't nearly as fun as some of VH's other albums, at least they aren't trying to fake it.  I felt like on the two albums previous to this, that some of the 'fun' was forced.  On this one, it isn't forced because they aren't pretending to have fun (except for on Amsterdam, which I don't like).  Some very good songs on here are Can't Stop Lovin' You, Don't Tell Me (What Love Can Do), Not Enough, Take Me Back, and Feeling.  Aftershock isn't bad, either.  If they had just left it at that, this would actually be a very good album.  However, there are some pretty bad songs on here as well.  In addition to Amsterdam, which seems very forced to me, I don't like Seventh Seal (seems to be off rhythm to me), Big Fat Money (dumb), Doin' Time, Strung Out, or Baluchitherium (ranging from experimental to completely forgettable).<br />So, while I struggle a bit with giving an album with 5 good songs, and one okay song a low rating, it is hard to ignore the fact that the other half of the album (6 songs) is not very good to bad.  I'd give it about 3.5 stars if that were available, but since it's not, I'm going with a 3.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this CD to any Van Hagar fan, or fans of VH that don't despise Hagar (like myself) and don't mind filing past the garbage to get to the good stuff.
B005HSL626|5.0|I so love this game my high score is over 1,000 to the stupid people who don't &quot;like&quot; the adds tough crap its free if you want no adds then go buy the 2.99 verison
B000002LPD|3.0|Some good songs on here to be sure.  Poundcake, Judgement Day, The Dream is Over, and Top of the World are all very good songs.  The problem with this album, imo, is that there are an abundance of weak songs on here as well, including some of the more popular songs from the album.  Runaround and Right Now, two songs that got a lot of airplay back in the day, just didn't do it for me.  In and Out as well as Man on a Mission were close to being good, imo, but again just didn't quite work.  They seemed to be, as was the case with OU812, TRYING too hard to be good and just not getting there.<br /><br />Then there are the absolute stinkers, Pleasure Dome and Spanked.  Yuck!  Spanked may be the worst VH song ever made (okay, short of that awful song that Eddie sang on VH III).  The lyrics on both are awful as is the tune.  I'm no musical expert, but I know what I like, and these songs aren't it.<br /><br />So, overall, there are some good songs on here, but they are completely drowned in a sea of bad songs.  I know people will disagree with me, especially my assessment of Right Now and Runaround, but they just don't work for my ears.  I would recommend this album if you like Van Hagar, are a VH completist, or don't mind getting an album with a few good songs on it and a lot of forgettable to bad ones.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great free app. The adverts aren't too annoying. would recommend this app to any one.<br />Think I convinced my dad to buy a Kindle Fire just from him playing this on mine.
B000002L99|4.0|I remember back in '86 when this disc (or was it cassette back then?) came out.  I was disappointed that Roth had left the band, but anxious to hear their new sound.  I actually had the good fortune of liking the song \\"Why Can't This Be Love\\" from the radio before I even realized it was Van Halen, so it was a good entry point into the overall album and the Van Hagar era.  Upon listening to all of the songs, I actually liked (and still like) them all except for the rather boring \\"Inside\\" which is the final track.<br /><br />What I like about this album, and what differentiates it from the rest of the Van Hagar era releases, imo, is the fact that the band actually seems to be having fun...that old style VH type of fun.  This is a CD that you can roll down the windows of your car in the summer time and just crank it up.  Good Enough, Why Can't This Be Love, Dreams, Love Walks In, Hot Summer Nights...these are all fun tunes that just make you feel like hanging out and having a good time.  That, to me, is what VH is about (which is why I always liked Roth).  While these songs don't sound exactly like Roth era VH and are more heavily synth driven, they are still entertaining and, if Roth had to leave, this album represents a quality continuation of the party atmosphere that VH is known for.<br /><br />I wouldn't classify myself a Van Hagar fan, since I admittedly like Roth and the vibe he brings better, but I would recommend this cd to anyone that is a fan of Van Hagar and/or Van Halen that don't despise Hagar.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's a challenge and I like that. some of the games r hard. too bad its not two player. ofcourse I just got it. lol
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever it is very addicting so many choices I can play on the go or at home I love it
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|Looks fun but force closes on Evo 4G, even after rebooting phone.  Bummer, since it looks like a fun game.  I'll update my review if you fix the issue.  Thanks!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I wish I could play this game but I get an instant force close.  I have an HTC Inspire. Please fix.<br /><br />Thanks
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy, I feel like nothing else will compare. These books are just everything I look for in a great book.  I feel as though I personally know Christian and Ana. The story was an emotional journey that I was able to completely emerse myself into. At moments I was shocked, uncomfortable, laughing, swooning, you name it it's here in these stories. Fifty Shades Freed was a perfect ending to the trilogy. I felt as though Ms. James really took the stories full circle, the epilogue was just perfect, really allowing the reader a glimpse into Fifty's  and Ana's life after the dust has settled so to speak.  I highly recommended any avid reader of romantic, erotic, contemporary, character driven stories to read these books, they are just that good.
0811876373|5.0|Bought this book at a great price and love it!  I love making different cake pops and this book helped me do just that!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Every time I open it up, it force closes on me! I'm sure it's a great app, but I wouldn't know! I absolutely love shooting games likes this... Too bad it won't work for me. ):<br />HTC EVO 4G
B006UG90RM|5.0|Enough of Sammy Hagar, commenting in the media that he hopes this disc does not tarnish the legacy or rather his legacy with Van Halen. Chickenfoot WISHED the could do a disc like this. Eddie has exercised his demons, and come out of the blocks with a sound that is BEYOND THE BROWN SOUND. Every track on this disc is great no filler, no fluff, just plain rock and roll.<br /><br />STAY FROSTY BOYS !!!!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great sound effects. A great take on this game, the quest mode is interesting. Best Mahjong game I have played period.
0394806220|5.0|I purchased this book for my granddaughter who is 2 years old.  It is a fun book to read and she loves it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really kook. I love that it has all kinds of games so if you are not good at one.I highly recamend this game to everyone
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|really this game is way better on the arcade machine. even if this game is free, don't waste your money and time on this shooting game
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is the best specially when have time alone.... Me encanta &eacute;sta aplicaci&oacute;n es la mejor especialmente cuando tienes tiempo a solas...
B005JSM5YW|1.0|I'm so relieved that I spent only .99 to watch this mostly unwatchable film.  Steve Carell should beg the producers of \\" the office\\" for his role as Michael Scott back.  That's where Carell's comedic abilities were put to their best use.<br /><br />This movie has a rambling mish mash of a plot, with, except for Emma Stone, unlikeable shallow characters and an unappealing, intrusive soundtrack.  See it and realize that you've wasted 2 hours of your valuable time.  Or maybe you can catch up on some sleep which then would make it worthwhile.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|just installed it. tried to run. no luck. Evo 3D. going to give it a 2 star for now. if it updates and runs I'll change my rating.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I like it. I grew up with space invaders and his app is pretty similar. Took a bit to get use to the &quot;flow of things&quot;. Works great on the kindle fire. I love the sounds when they talk. lol.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I loved this game but after the most recent update (Feb 24,2012), I can't even get past the load screen without the game crashing. I have a Droid X. I have a feeling whatever they did to try to help the ICS community broke the 2.x community.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Force close upon open.. Droid Razr Maxx. Really looked good too.  Fox this please! It would probably look and run awesome on this phone
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Great songs...great band...great Fun.<br /><br />This CD is phenomenal and I absolutely love it. I would recommend it to anyone. Buy this. I'm going to see Fun. in concert this upcoming week and am so excited. If you haven't heard of this band, do so ASAP.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I began using this case in October for my white 4S.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Still in great shape, physically. However, I am pretty careful with my phone, and I don't have kids.<br />The TPU feels tough and fits snugly on my phone.<br />Nice and slim!<br />The subtle concentric circle pattern is fine and doesn't distract. (I don't want anything busy... I like the aesthetic of the iPhone by itself)<br />The screen protecter is still going strong! This is the only one I've had on my phone since I bought it. I put it on myself and it has lived longer than any screen protector that has been put on at the AT&T store. If it starts lifting, I'll replace it with an invisishield.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />the case has greyed/yellowed slightly with use. But really.... who cares. It's been in and out of pockets and purses for months. Great life for a case.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so cool I am not just doing this for points I think it is awesome
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I hated this game it was really boring also it dosen't respond on kindle fires it may be free but what ever u do DON'T BUY THIS APP
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Bruno Mars is an amazing and very gifted artist.  He is such a romantic and loves life with all his heart and keeps on surprising us with all his talent -- Keep up the beautiful songs!!
0756404738|5.0|The stories that Kvothe tells are a delight! I told the story about the boy with a golden screw in his belly button and; Jax and the moon to my 5 and 7 year old boys. It is such a joy to see that they were in awe of Rothfuss's artful prose!
B0030BYWKU|5.0|Very gifted artist -- Jason has so much wonderful experience on and off the stage -- If you haven't read his Bio, you need to, as you will be very surprised of everything he has experienced is his short, young life.
0756405890|5.0|I am writing this review after reading the second book. 5 stars! I will certainly invest more time to read the last book. Readers should take time to read these books and savor the characters.
B006C45CFG|1.0|We knew when we ordered this that is was going to be different.  It was a waste of time and not entertaining. We continued to watch just so not to waste the money.  You shook your head thru the whole movie.  It was strange that none of the indians or town people where scared seeing the alien's flying vehicles (for lack of a better word).  The cast must have really needed the money, I bet none of them put this on their resume.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great game with colorful retro graphics with a bit of humor thrown in. I have no trouble running it on my Samsung Infuse. I'd definitely buy a game from this developer.
0764141201|5.0|English is my second language and it's a very good and useful book! I love it!!! exercises are presented in the way so that you remember the words very well. Would recommend it to everyone!
B00005N6KG|3.0|Not bad for the price.  I'm not sure why when I bought these I thought they were behind the ear type headphones, but they are not.  They're nice for the gym because they don't have foam pads to get wet and they're also not too expensive like many of the other options for gym headphones out there.  Also, I find the cable to be just a bit short, but it hasn't been a problem for me yet.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Black screen and Force Closes when app is launched.  Samsung Epic. Tried everything to get it to work, no success.  Will change rating when fixed.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Love it, challanging and fun! I don't want put the game down. A great stratagy game. My new favorite. A must have.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Beside all of the discussions about the content changes of the movies, the look of these on Blu Ray is great, which was all I was concerned about. They look good and work great.

B0006VBFM0|3.0|I bought this watch 7 months ago, and I've worn it almost every day, including in bed, in the shower, in the sun, etc. The colors have stayed bright; the watch tells time perfectly well; and I've gotten a number of compliments on the cheerfulness of the design. However, a month or two ago, the clear plastic coating on the band started to bubble and peel up, exposing the stripey colored layer beneath, and it now looks pretty shoddy as a result, so the band hasn't stood up to 24/7 wear.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I bought this game a while ago because I like top down shooters and I also like games from Hexage. I don't regret paying the 1.99 pricetag at the time. Glad to see a good game on FAotD.
0553386794|5.0|The HBO series has been called the Sopranos meet Lord of the Rings.  There is some sorcery, much sword but mostly court intrigues, interesting characters and lots of drama and action.  Filled with \\"good Guys you like, bad guys you want to hate, but prove to be more human than anything.  There are even some characters you might feel guilty really liking.<br />Not for children this read is adult in nature, both in how it does not insult your intelligence but more importantly in the graphic nature of humanity at its best and worst in a very different time and place.  If the term or occupation \\"whore\\" bother you, you should NOT read this series.  However if you want to explore a world that it gross and glorious, saintly and demonic, you will find it all here.  Also of note, if you are a fan of the series, You wont be disappointed because the Author is a writer for the series and they do follow along very closely with the first season reflecting this entire first book.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps I've ever downloaded. There are so many different sounds and being able to have up to 3 playing at a time allows for a vast array of combinations. It's also nice that you can save your favorite combos to access easily since there are so many to choose from. I like to play a combo of campfire, distant thunder, and beach sounds while I study and I can almost smell the woodsmoke.

B000X107GI|5.0|I just received two packages of these from the vendor MYBATTERYSUPPLIER about 3 days after I placed the order.  The batteries in both packages were marked with the number \\"10\\".  I'm going to assume that is the year they were made.  The packaging has no expiration date anywhere on it.  But, it is marked Maxell,\\"Made in Japan\\" and has the Maxell hologram.  The batteries are also stamped \\"Japan\\".  Using a VOM on one battery from each card the tested voltage on each was 3.24 VDC.  As best I can figure they are fresh and strong.  I got 10 good batteries for the price of just two in my local Walmart so I'm pleased with my purchase.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Looks cool, but unfortunately it immediately force closes on the Galaxy Nexus so unless it's updated I'll never know. Meh.
B000MD9UJC|1.0|This product seems like a common sense upgrade to a maglite. Mine worked intermitently for years. When I say intermitent I mean, on one second off the next....ten seconds of screwing with it, then its on for 30 seconds...then off. Repeat. It will be working just fine, I'll turn it off without moving it in any way, and it will not turn on again. I'll mess with it forever trying to get it to work and sometimes it just flat wont work. Then I pick it up a week later and it works. True P O S ! ! !<br /><br />I wrote in to the manufacturer who responded with a new led and switch. These are just as bad.<br /><br />All together I've used three mini-mags, and two led conversions. Now none of them work. I should have saved the money and bought a really expensive flashlight the first time.

B006QANR5I|5.0|Although the series is a \\"soap opera,\\" it is exceptionally well cast, the scenes shift quickly to retain your interest, and the story seems historically correct for the most part, despite use of current dialogue on occasion. This episode is another excellent one!

Any droid owner that wouldn't lay down the money before has no excuse now that it is the free app of the day (sorry if you are reading this afterwards, but if you are, just buy it, you cheap jerk). Great mobile game. Ignore the lower rating. A lot of reviews one star it simply because of compatibility issues.

B006H8BIIM|4.0|Great game, takes three tower defense genre to a whole new level. My only gripe its that paying in HD on my Droid RAZR its really hard to read the text and pressing the in screen buttons because they are so small. Make those items more readable and ok give this a 5.

1401223176|5.0|my buddy owns a comic book store and paid me in comics to work for him while i was in college. in my humble opinion this is a near perfect comic book. yes its both adult and kid friendly and i am more into adult story lines i was still excited to read this. Jim Lee is one of my favorite artist (WildCATS&lt; i have the full run). And loeb is a great writer. This book is exactly what a comic should be. Now for some adult fare i recommend The Authority, Fathom, Invisibles, Preacher, Darkness, Rising Stars( what heros was based from), Midnight Nation.

B002ZG993Q|2.0|Normally any movie with George Clooney is a better movie simply because he is in it. True, he is easy on the eyes, but I also think he is an amazing actor.  But even George could not save this one.<br /><br />First of all it is a very quiet movie.  There is way too much time with no dialogue going on.  From a plot perspective, it was very thin.  Anyone could guess how this movie was going to end and who the bad guys were in the first 15 minutes.  How many movies does Hollywood have to make about \\"the one final job and I am out\\"?<br /><br />Even the ending you see coming has more holes than a pasta strainer.  I don't want to give away anything to anyone who has the patience to sit through this, but George decides he wants to start a new life with a lady of the evening - but the film shows almost no interaction between them other than physical The character George plays is way too smart and complex to fall in love over a physical encounter.<br /><br />Sorry George.  I will try and not let this affect our long term relationship.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|my kids love. a little bit of everything on it for everyone.  two thumbs up! I play them when I have down time at work and its great for passing time.

0385738765|5.0|Scorch Trials picks up, literally, where The Maze Runner leaves off and there is no lack of excitement!!! I've been staring at my computer screen for about an hour now, contemplating what I want to say about Scorch Trials and I still don't have any idea. This book absolutely blew me away! Typically, I don't expect much from sequels. They're usually a little boring and the only purpose they serve is to build a bridge between the first and last books. However, Scorch Trials was like a completely different book!! Also, there was just enough romance to keep my attention on that situation.<br /><br />The same group of Gladers is on yet another trial in The Scorch, a wasteland completely burned by the sun flares, and there is no lack of adventure!! I honestly felt like I was reading a completely different book! Thomas is his same old self, always jumping in to save his friends and quick on his feet whenever the Gladers are threatened. Minho and Newt provide the same tension and comic relief as can be expected. We also meet some new characters who were a lot of fun to read about as well! Teresa isn't as involved in this story, and I'm honestly still confused by that relationship; I don't really know how I feel about her anymore!<br /><br />The whole story is incredibly fast-paced and so much happens that I was never bored or even wanted to put the book down! It isn't often that I completely immerse myself in a book so much that I forget everything else around me, but with Scorch Trials I found myself so into the story that hours went by without me even realizing! Everything that happens is just such a \\"WTF\\" moment, that I ended up annoying a lot of people with my constant gasping about the situations that occur. I'm still not sure what to think about everything that happened, or what to believe even!!<br /><br />Dashner continues to amaze me with his fantastic writing style and completely relatable characters. Reading Scorch Trials was another goose bump filled experience, and I'm still thinking about all of the crazy things that happened! I can't wait to get my hands on Death Cure, I need to know what's going to happen to Thomas and the Gladers!!! If you haven't read The Maze Runner yet, you definitely need to. This series is amazing, definitely one of the best dystopian series around!! (If you couldn't tell by the massive amount of exclamation marks, I really loved this book!!!!)and I'm still thinking about all of the crazy things that happened!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I don't get much of a chance to read for pleasure. I knew this was getting a lot of attention and wanted to see what it was all about - if one can rent it for free, then why not?<br />I couldn't put it down. In any spare time I had I went straight back to the book. I finished it in just three days, it was so good.<br />The writing style is a little jarring sometimes, at least for me, but once you get past that and really involve yourself in the characters this book becomes a gem. I have never wanted to cry from a book before, but even in just chapter 2 I felt tears threatening.<br />It might seem a.bit shallow on the surface, but if you get into the depth of it this book has a lot to offer to a reader of any age.
B005NA3B8U|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite games. I actually bought a TurboGrafix 16 video game system back in the day, solely because it had R-Type. The problem with this version is the controls. They are not intuitive enough, which makes a difficult game harder. I used to be able to finish the game, now I can't get past level one. I would like to think that the touch screen format is the problem more than the idea that I just plain suck at it now.
B006ISJQ1W|1.0|I like Johnny Depp movies in general and always view them when they are released.  Next to \\"The Secret Garden\\" this is by far his worst effort.  The movie is slow and totally disjointed.  No action, no mystery, no nothing.  I hate when I waste two hours of my life!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I was surprised at the quality of the games. There is something for everyone. I like the goal based system where you must play to earn more games. Very addictive and highly recommended!

0374275637|5.0|The book was reviewed and recommended by David Brooks in the local paper.  He recommended it to lay readers interested in psychology and economics because Dr Kahneman is such a readable writer as well as a scholarly researcher.  I found the book to be exactly that: readable and scholarly.  I can't say I understood everything but I certainly learned something and was inspired to re-read and research further.

0545265355|4.0|[...]      I just finished reading all three Hunger Games books. I know that I'm a little behind the times, but with some many books on my plate reading them hasn't happened until now. I love dystopian books. If you enjoy a nice everything gets completely better happily ever after type book, then this isn't for you. Like all good anti-utopia books, the Hunger Games shows us extremes of today's societal faults.The world that Suzanne Collins creates is terrifying. One can't help but thinking if some of the dangers of Panem are already being seen here in America.  The United States and other well to do countries are very much like the capitol with the rest of the world barely with enough to live on. The world powers are nations of excess in pursuit of trivial entertainment. No we do not pit our children against one another in a Mad Max Beyond Thunder Dome type arena in which 12 kids enter one kid leaves. The games are just a way of showing even greater social problems. The books show that even within the Capital there are the haves and have-nots.      I personally did not care too much for the main heroine, Katniss. Although I do think her development is more consistent with a real person put under extremely stressful circumstances. She just doesn't come across as particularly nice or likeable; a fault even the character will admit to. She has occasional acts of deeming quality. She does have a strength of character that stands in contrast to her environment. Also a fierce protective instinct of those whom she deems unable to defend themselves.Overall her lack of ability to acknowledge emotions other than fear and mistrust make her a little annoying to read since the story is written in first person. Collins actually made a character come across as both whiny and abrasive. Maybe her internal monologue was the problem; had the story been written in third person Katniss may not have been such an unlikeable character. I can't imaging trying to develop a love triangle witha main love interest like her. Peeta and Gale, the boys vying for young Katniss's affection, are both very likable. Peeta has this natural upbeat personality that brings a ray of sunshine to otherwise downtrodden cast of character's. His major fault being his complete devotion to Katniss. Even when he finds out that the love between them that sparks in the arena is all for show, he is hurt but still loves her. He is the embodiment of the phrase love is blind. It takes being brainwashed for him to question his love for Katniss, something even he overcomes in the end. Their games mentor, Haymitch, has it right when he tells Katniss that she doesn't deserve him. Gale on the other hand is a little more realistic in his devotion to Katniss. He gets angry with her and challenges her. My major complaint with The Hunger Games is that the characters don't rise above their circumstances very much. They remain strong enough to bring about a revolution and bring about change, but their evolution ends in beaten down, broken people; not people healing and leading their world after over throwing the government.      The story development was rather good. I actually read all three books in three days time. The plot was very captivating with plenty of action and drama. Some critics thought the story line was a little too Running Man for them, but I disagree. The games are a tool to keep its citizens completely at the mercy of its government, not a form of punishment for criminals and rebels. Panem makes its citizen watch the games and propaganda to instill fear. If this is what they do in retaliation for one uprising, what lengths would they go to if a second one failed. This is in addition to the other accidents, paltry living conditions, and segregation between districts. Panem keeps it's citizens too hungry and without a means to rally to help keep control. In the first book, I just wanted Katniss and Peeta to make it back to their loved ones alive.      As the second book developed, I kept hoping Katniss would want to fight back against the Capital. She wants to run away and keep everyone safe. Gale luckily doesn't want just safety for his family, but all of District 12. Since Katniss is seen as a unifying force due to her small rebellion at the end of book one, the president wants to make an example out of her and other victors by making them fight to the death again. She loses her chance to escape and resigns herself to not making it home again. Her only goal becomes repaying a debt she feels she owes to Peeta by trying to keep him alive. Peeta is so devoted to Katniss that you hope that she will start to love him also. I believe she does, but just doesn't allow herself the luxury of feeling for him. She writes her true feelings off as part of her debt to him. It is very frustrating to read. Catching Fire ends with a bang, with a small introduction into Rebel forces freeing some of the victors.      The introduction of the Rebels leaves the reader needing to find out how it all ends. Katniss needs to make choices as to what her part will be in the resistance and which young man she wants to be with. In the end she finds herself backed into a corner and takes a role with the resistance as her only recourse. I think the story might have developed better if Katniss had made a concrete choice. Mockingjay shows all the bad sides of war. The tragic loss of innocent life on both sides. The extremes in which even the so called good guys will go to in which to become victorious. How when you replace one government with another, you never really know if the new one will be better.      All in all, I recommend all three books with a Mad Hatter rating. The Hunger Games was my personal favorite of the trio.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game and it is good for passing time. some of the controls are hard to get used to but whatever
B0031RS69G|5.0|Incredible story!<br /><br />It is right what they say though, (take it from a still novice pratchettette of three books vintage) the Discworld novels ARE easier in sequence.<br /><br />Fabulous engaging story that took most of an afternoon. Am fighting instinct to restart it now - but I have Wyrdsisters to move onto... ;)
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|never got a chance to play it because it wouldn't ever even open. Force closed upon opening. HTC Evo running aokp ICS
1583334386|4.0|Trying to make a habit of using one principle taught in this book each week. Some explanations of our motivations very memorable, like the one describing how dopamine makes us think what we want will satisfy us. Little phrases keep coming to mind when I want to eat something that I know is not good for me - especially \\"would you eat that same thing every day all week?\\" Helpful book, but only if you can discipline yourself enough to apply the principles in it every day.

B006E4QCXU|1.0|if I were u, I would not buy it.......its dumb and is a waist of money. I don't understand why I bought it but its very stupid.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game. Interface is very good. I would even say that the graphics are better than the Nintendo DS version.
B006ON41FC|1.0|This is not just annoying, but very intrusive - I agree with other on the Open Feint issue. Open Feint behaves like a hacking site this way. Every time game is on, it creates an Open Feint account automatically (if it's not ther eyet). No asking for permission, nothing - you're online with an account whether you like it or not.<br /><br />Do not believe those who say you can go and disable it or remove it through Open Feint menu: 1) in my case (Samsung Tablet) there is NO menu button on the Open Feint page if I go there from this game (yes, it is true!) so I have to remove it via Fruit Ninja (crazy, but true); 2) After removing an account, the game creates a new one anyway, if opened!<br /><br />And, after all, why would I have to go EVERY TIME the same steps to remove or log out of this \\"open faint\\"!? All it would take it do it like Fruit Nija - voluntarily... but no - this game violates my rights to privacy and to make my own decision.<br /><br />END Games Entertainment LLC, creator of Going Nuts, IS A PRIVACY VIOLATOR!!! This was a waisted one dollar...<br /><br />Amazon should be getting rid of that sort of spam/hacking practicing companies.
B00005JPCF|3.0|I bought this movie without reading any reviews, I just assumed it was a kid's movie.  So I bought it for my 2 year old daughter.  But the movie is not really a kid's movie...  More for adults I think.  The plot & the music all seem to be adult related.  But my daughter likes it anyway, for the penguin babies. :)  I did not enjoy the movie.
0783230710|3.0|I was astounded that the (US) DTS version of the DVD does not have subtitles.  I love the movie, which is why I wanted to get the DTS version (NTSC, Region 1).  The listing did not mention sub-titles, I should have realized what that meant.  I have no use for a BlueRay or the European versions of the movie (that have both DTS and subtitles).  Oh well.  David.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Good movie.  If you like any amount of sci fi, this movie will be good for you.  There are some elements I don't quite grasp, but this is why I buy it!  So I can re-watch. :)
0385342063|5.0|I'm amazed when a simple story in the hands of a talented writer turns out to be a page-turner.  Sophie Kinsella certainly has this gift.  Her quirky characters are always fun to read about and despite the thickness of this book, it didn't take me long to finish it because the story's pace was exhilarating. Trouble starts when Poppy loses her heirloom engagement ring, then loses her life-support cell phone.  Desperate to have a phone that she can be reached at in case her ring is found, she finds one in a waste bin, apparently discarded by a convention member at the hotel she had her bridal shower in.  Little did she know that finding the phone will embroil her in a corporate scandal that threatens to ruin a good man's name.  I enjoyed Poppy's candid personality and how despite getting into all sorts of mayhem, she still is able to hold on to her dignity and keep her chin up. And who wouldn't fall in love with reluctant hero Sam, who appears to be made of stone but turns out to have a marshmallow-soft heart.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and hope others will as well.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is awesome, and you need to try it because some peoples reviews are horrible,and some are just stupid
B006ON41FC|5.0|My kids love this game . its so funny and addictive,  I recommend. this game to the peopla that have kids!
1451627289|5.0|One of the things I liked most about this book was the references to the fifties and sixties.  It brought back so many memories of my youth and what I was doing during that time.  Jake actually got the opportunity to live \\"if I knew then what I know now!\\". You were able to see what you missed and what you didn't miss.  Mostly I missed my youth. The other was the simplicity of the time. It makes you wonder how the youth of today will feel about these years we live in now when they're in their old age.  Very interesting.<br /><br />Although I really like happy endings, I felt the ending was very appropriate considering Jake's personallity. Deep down inside and in the long run, he would not have been happy with it any other way.  Doing the right thing sometimes means great sacrafice. What I liked best was the moral that dwelling on what you should have done in the past is a waste of time, and that things could have been a lot worse if you could change them. It is best to just accept it, learn from it, and move on.<br /><br />I enjoyed the memories and the book very much and would recommend it, and think it would make a great movie.
B00004YC2F|5.0|Usless to say that Russian great virtuoso Arcadi Volodos offers here a landmark version of the celebrated gem called Rach3 (Piano concerto No.3 by Rachmaninov). His partners are Berlin Philharmonic orchestra led by James Levine. To complete the program, Volodos included on this recording wonderful accounts of some favorite solo pieces by the same composer.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B005LL4U54|4.0|This soundtrack is just \\"ART\\" and it definitely will win Academy Awards.<br />But the music in this \\"Original Soundtrack\\" is a little different from the actual movie and some music is missing.<br />Here is the list.<br /><br />- SPOILER ALERT -<br /><br />1. Most of all, Bernard Herrmann's \\"Scene d'Amour\\" score from \\"Vertigo\\" is NOT here.<br /><br />Instead, they included Ludovic Bource's own score (track 23) which is very similiar with Hermann's and it's also good, too. But I feel a little disappointment because \\"Scene d'Amour\\" score was perfectly fit in that final climax.<br /><br />2. The music in George's \\"Auction\\" scene is completely not included.<br /><br />3. The music in the scene which George spilled the liquor in his face in 1932 is also not included.<br /><br />4. Finally, the music in the scene George and Doris (his wife) are arguing is not included, either.<br /><br />I hope the complete soundtrack would be released in the near future..
B005JZ18IY|5.0|I own just over fifty CDs and nearly a thousand songs on my iPod and this is by far the most played. It has something for everyone and I have not met a person who did not like at least one of these songs. I love them all <3

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I find that I use this Bible app more than the Bible I purchased for my Kindle Fire. It's very easy to manuever and it gives you multiple translations to choose from. There are also daily reading plans which are very good and a wonderful way to stay in the word.
B000AQJPQE|2.0|Pros:<br />Easy installation. We have beams in the house so instead of screwing to the drywall ceiling we just hung the toy with strings to the beam. Worked very well.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very small.<br />Very dimly lit sun. The planets are barely visible.<br />The light bulb needs to be a bit brighter & the planets need to emit some light as well. The effect was not what we were hoping for! Not that great of a product!
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|pretty good game if you like hidden object games. I would say,to be fair,  it might be rated higher if you are a big fan of hidden object games. I am enjoying it but it gets a little repetative for my taste. some interesting extras like the mist like object searches. story was o.k. could do without the nagware! graphics are good but again...repetative scenes. plenty of levels though! certainly worth the investment if you are a hidden object gamer!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|I am so glad I rented this movie! I may even add this to my DVD collection. I didn't expect to like it so much. I just wanted to see a Steve Martin movie, but I was afraid that a movie about birding might be boring. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! I highly recommend this flick!
B005RYF5JA|5.0|if you like celtic woman this is a great concert with a new singer joining the group. However if you are new to celtic woman you have a good group of singers as well as some great songs, e.g. circle of life by elton john (comes under tribute to broadway), you'll never walk alone and some good new songs like nocturne, awakening and ave maria
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A really great SciFi read.  The end of the world has come and gone, but there are survivors hundreds of years later who are totally ignorant of the fact.  A secret found followed by a tragedy is about to set a world ablaze for at least one small contained universe.  These were originally issued as a series of short interlinked novels and I'm glad I waited till the omnibus edition was available to read the foll story.  It has genuinely nail biting moments and a satisfying end. Despite that I would still love to read more about these characters and their world.  If you are looking for a good scifi read this author is worth taking a chance on.
B007BLDFWG|5.0|This movie isn't for everyone... if you're one of those people who can't handle a plot which takes its time to develop, avoid this like the plague, because you'll be complaining that it's \\"too slow\\".<br /><br />However, if you're like me and actually appreciate that type of movie, this is one of the best movies of 2011, and easily THE BEST MOVIE EVER on the subject of cults and brainwashing.  Elizabeth Olsen would have received an Oscar nomination in a just world, but since this movie wasn't touched by Tom Hanks/Steven Spielberg and didn't have a Holocaust/Gender-Bending/Period-Piece theme, it apparently wasn't worthy Oscar-Bait and she was snubbed.<br /><br />To give away any of the plot would spoil the movie, so I'll just wrap it up by saying that anyone interested in cults and independant movies needs to see this.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very easy to use. I like the  different versions. Never knew there were so many. the footnotes are great too, very thorough.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|A terrific movie, if just a tad simplistic.  To anyone with a modicum of perception, it is obvious that this is a parable about capitalism, highlighting many of the largely ignored problems of our economic system.  It is quite appropriate to this era of OWS versus the 99%.<br /> Time is money.  A poor man (Timberlake) finds a way out of the ghetto, thus encountering all the systemic opposition that this discovery is sure to generate.  Nothing unbelievable about that.  The director (who also did Gattaca) provides us with a number of the adages and questions that apply to our own system, such as,  \\"Is it theft to steal what is already stolen?\\" and  \\"Not everyone can be immortal (rich).\\" This latter statement is shot down early in the movie when a disillusioned character exposes the \\"truth,\\" saying, \\"there is enough for everyone.\\"  In our current era of technology, in which wealth and poverty is not a problem of scarcity, but distribution, I found this willingness to examine the issue in this way to be refreshing.<br /> Perhaps most believable of all was the way that society had accommodated this impossible culture.  (I suspect that in a few hundred years historians will say the same thing about the excesses of Western society.)  The rich, \\"don't look. (at death and suffering)  You close your eyes.\\"  And the poor largely accept their lot.<br /> The near impossibility of changing the system is emphasized, which I found pessimistically accurate.  Still, I would have hoped for a more political or revolutionary solution than the \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" style ending it leaves us with.
B005VPRFSY|5.0|Growing up a star wars fan and being one still, I got this for my son. After he opened it and put it together I got one for myself. R2 is the typical LEGO R2, but this one contains a redesigned 3PO that has a lot more detailed print on the figure than the older version. It looks really nice. The sand troopers are really cool printed with sand on them very detailed (for LEGO). The escape pod is a lot better than the older version as well, it's bigger and the design is cool that you can take the top off and put it on fairly easy.<br />The set is easy to put together for the youngsters, there are a lot of stickers on the pod that younger kids may need help with to get them on straight. Great collector item for the older fans.
B0058WFO06|5.0|Yes, I am just another one who gets more than crazy about this album... this is really serious stuff, this is not a good try this is totally an accomplishment. Very strong, designed to listen to it with more that the five senses.<br /><br />It's interesting how SW shows his skills on the keyboards in several songs here, Travis' work is splendorous and dark at times, very well combined to really twist your mind. There is a relation among calm, dark, psycho, melodic which is tremendously well connected, perhaps it's just as a movie flowing with only sounds to more than your ears, perhaps the only easy one is the lovely \\"Postcard\\"<br /><br />Grace for Drawning along with Opeth's Heritage clearly show that prog is not only based in virtuosism with no sense and too much excitement, in fact I don't consider SW a virtuoso (has his touch of course) neither Mikael Akerfeldt, talking about non-clasic prog musicians.<br /><br />Don't try to find PT, No-Man, I.E.M. or Blackfield here (or any other project in which SW might have been involved). Listen to it calmly, perhaps alone and loudly. then you may be ready for having good nighmares
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|1. beautiful graphics<br />2. nice story<br />3. fun sounds<br />4. Awesome neon looking colors<br />5. Great &quot;more games &quot; interface (if you check it out its pretty neat)<br />6. multiple game modes<br />7. Pretty good gameplay<br />8. bug-less in Kindle Fire<br />I would pay what they are asking for and it would be worth every peny!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this solitery game. its a good time time waster and I would say any one should get it

B0054JZC6E|5.0|There are fun and awesome games. I'm playing it 24/7. I don't see how anyone couldn't! I always have my Kindle with me!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is the ultimate forever alone game alive! Perfect for those individuals with no love life or life or justbin general a kids game haha
B0063GORYU|4.0|good graphics, fast, and addictive, helps pass the time, but could use a little larger cards/fonts. Overall very entertaining,  thanks.
B006903GX8|2.0|This book does not translate well to Kindle. Photos can't be seen clearly or photos are too large which takes up two pages which can't be seen together. Will place the hard copy version on my wishlist.
0439023491|1.0|Awesome cover, can't wait to read this! Yay. On its way.<br /><br />I love her other work, and looking forward to getting stuck into this Trilogy.
B005OCFHHK|2.0|Six of the eight work great, but when you want a whole series and two of the disks keep skipping it really ticks you off!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|The game runs beautifully on my N1. It has a great sense of humor and nods to some old school classics. I find that it is too easy to bring up the menu when I'm playing and that has gotten me killed a couple of times. Also, I have no idea which weapon upgrades I should choose, as there are no descriptions that I noticed. Still, it is a fun game and worth your time.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|I thought it was super fun but wait you don't get to solve cud it is FIVE DOLLARS for full.... dang
0307891372|4.0|the guide arrived before the estimated date. the book has all the pages that ive looked so far. the book helps clear most things you may be confused about. there are however some things the book doesnt go into detail about like potions and ingredients, but does for some of them. all in all it was worth buying and does have detailed maps and quest info and also leveling and skills too.
1557048630|5.0|This is a gorgeous book with brilliant pictures and a decent amount of text that gives lots of insight into the processes that went into creating the film and what the artists were thinking and drawing before they settled on their final desgins. I'd urge any fans of the film to get this but would note the following: I ordered this book from amazon.com and I was not satisfied with the packaging. The cover is made of a hard to describe material that seems waxy but delicate and was covered in dirty fingerprints. It was also packaged so that it was free to slide around the overly large box, potentially destroying the corners. Fortunately, the corners of my copy seemed to survive and I managed to wipe away the fingerprints (very carefully) but I would be cautious in the future, possibly buying from a different buyer, paying for better postage or specifying special postage instructions beforehand.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|If you are planning on seeing the movie \\"Hunger Games\\", and if that reason is because someone else wants you to see it because it is a great book, then I have one bit of advice for you....read the book first then decide.<br />Now for those of you who have forgotten your history North America rose in rebellion and the victorious capitol region divided the country into 12 districts. All of which get to send two teenage citizens a year in a competition to the death. And death they most certainly do. And this is the big problem I have the book is the whole sanitization of teenage death. Now before you get ready to send me an angry note  I do realize that was the point, it was a critique. A critique on violence in the communities, the extremes that reality TV is going to (when I was reading this the MTV reality TV show about teenage pregnant girls was popular) However I personally do not think it went far enough. This book, apparently targeted towards young adults could have actually been a significant piece of literature , instead, the author chickened out and played it safe.<br />Now on an intellectual level it was lacking. On a enjoyment level it was actually pretty good. I don't feel it was a ripoff of Running Man as some of the more sci-fi diehards among my friends have complained. It was a book, and no doubt satisfying for many people. Not everyone reads books to have worlds of thought opened for them. If it gets people reading books again then this is great. Despite my irrefutable thoughts to the contrary, not every book is written to please me.<br />If you are expecting this to be the most meaningful book every written you will be in for a major disappointment, but as a way to pass a day or two reading instead of watching the television, this is the right book for you.
B004A8ZX28|3.0|The movie is average, but still fun to watch.  The story is about a man who lost his memory.  Theres some exciting scenes, and explosions.  Unknown is a average, but enjoyable movie.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've been playing this game for years on my desktop computer and am happy to have it now on my Kindle.  I have no complaints, seems like the very same game, same rules and options as my desktop version.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Game crashes as soon as I open it.<br />I have the latest firmware 2.3.6 and plenty of memory to run it.<br /><br />Sorry,but I did not even had a chance to see a single screen of the game.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|bummer, I really wanted to play this. won't open, just gives you a force close on tbolt. hopefully they get it fixed.
B005HPA2XI|5.0|I absolutely love this album!! While it is not a concept album like Crack the Skye, it has great songs on it. The album as a whole is great, but to me the individual tracks are more memorable.<br /><br />One big disappointment is the DVD. The \\"making of\\" feature was 5 minutes... As a guitar player, audio engineer, and fan, I was extremely disappointed. I know it's not the band's fault, but it just seemed lazy to go in with (I'm assuming) hours of footage and hacking it down to 5 minutes. I did like the track-by-track commentary, but that also disappointed me because it was ONLY Brann's take on them. While I enjoyed it, I'd like to hear what Brent, Bill, or Troy had to say about them. Again, probably not the band's fault. The filmmaker probably was only able to catch Brann after a night of recording and didn't feel like catching up with the rest of the band the next day. I don't know... I just think it could have been a lot better.<br /><br />Buy this for the amazing songs, not the DVD.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Works fine, good responsive controls. I love the retro space invaders style game and permissions are not intrusive for this game. Thanks Amazon!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Most free games of the day for the kindle are not that great and I usually end up playing them for an hour and delete them. This is not the case, this is a fun little game to play when you're just plain bored. Not a lot of thought process is required.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|yes females. non male humans. as a non male human I refuse to play games that automatically assume I am male. goodbye hexage
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Just like back in the day. This space shooter is a like a cross between Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Galaga.  The ship auto-fires its weapons which is kind of a downer, but it's something I can live with. Doing it any other way would make controlling the ship more difficult. The sound effects are fun, and the game  even has that classic PC font.  Nice job, Devs!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was kinda boring on some games and they just werent fun enough to play all the games and its just odd to play but thats just my opinion
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|As with the overwhelming majority of Android apps, this one was made available for (by implication compatible with) an android device when it clearly wasn't tested by the developer. I would suggest that any developer who would charge ANY amount for their work would make every effort to ensure its compatibility with the devices it is made available for.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|Yes, there is classic Tarantino-style dialog and the movie is well put together, but the plot is silly and, unfortunately, Tarantino's protaganists are sadistic psychopaths whose behavior leads on at least two occasions in the film to root for the Nazis!  You have to come up with some pretty reprehensible characters to get your audience to pull for the ultimate evil-doers.  I realize this is a fantasy movie set in WWII, but it is so absurd it makes most sci-fi films seem plausible.  Also, I'm not generally very sensitive or easily offended, but maybe this setting and plot should have been avoided.  The Nazis and WWII brought incomprehensible suffering on those who lived through it and especially fought in it.  Though I don't think this movie is necessarily an affront to our veterans and the victims of the war, it just doesn't do any service to them at all and is at least a little bit offensive in handling the topic matter and setting.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|i loved playing this game... one of the best FAOTD.... reminds me of the old days... j j j j j
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|the game plays well on the KF but its just another shooter, nothing special. There are better ones out there.
1400069289|5.0|This book excites me.  We humans are creatures of habit.  \\"THE POWER OF HABIT: WHY WE DO WHAT WE DO AND HOW TO CHANGE IT\\" describes how successful corporations manipulate their customers through analyzing and exploiting habit.  Habits are described in terms of cue, routine, reward--and belief.  Belief is a major contributor to Alcoholics Anonymous' success (not 100%, but far more effective than merely treating chemical dependence) and the other major key is the power of group habits.<br />According to author Charles Duhigg, habits are not only individual--but social: family habits, clubs, neighborhoods, ethnic groups, states, nations, corporations--each human group brings different habits.  Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat on that Montgomery bus sparked a city-wide boycott because Rosa Parks was connected to diverse groups in the city--and these groups got together and formed an effective protest.  \\"The Power of Habits\\" explains why earlier protests in support of Blacks having the same civil rights as other citizens failed, and why the boycott sparked by Rosa Parks' arrest succeeded.<br />Starbucks couldn't FORCE people to spend $10 for a cup of coffee--but with a dedicated sales staff that puts Customer Service first, last and always people WANT to plunk down their hard-earned money and then leave a tip, too.  Duhigg tells how a kid from a broken home, someone who didn't have any chance of success, became a Starbucks manager through the Starbucks training program.<br />How did a toothpaste company contribute to National Defense?  How did concentrating on employee safety make ALCOA more productive and profitable?  How did a US Army commander in Iraq end the riots in his town without gunfire?  Read \\"The Power of Habits\\" and find out.<br />The edition provided through the Amazon Vine program was an Advance Reader's Copy and lacked an index and the table of contents lacked page numbers.  I'm purchasing a regular copy because I need the index for rapid reference.  Yes, I have a free copy--but I'm buying more because this is an outstanding reference book on human behavior,<br /> \\"The Power of Habits\\" is applied psychology..

B001KX50BK|3.0|My wife has worn out 2 VHS copies of this movie. When I saw it was on Blu-ray I thot it might be a nice present for her. I am still new to the whole Blu-ray thing but I was expecting much better picture quality. Some of the close up scenes were so grainy it looked like they had \\"pox\\" marks, we were very dissapointed. It was like they had copied an old, worn, VHS tape to Blu-ray. The 3 stars are because we still love the movie, just very sad about the picture quality.
B004EC5IV6|5.0|Evangelion 1.11 followed the original TV series ep1-6 with hardly any changes, 2.22 roughly follows ep8-19, but there are so many changes that it would be difficult to list them all! Here are just a few of those changes: Shinji has way less self-hatred, Asuka is more introverted instead of being that loud-mouthed b****(that I loved...), and Rei actually seems human and is more than able to start a conversation! There's also a new sexy female pilot who at the moment seems to serve no purpose except to increase the sale of Eva merchandise...<br /><br />That said, the best thing about 2.22 is the awe-inspiring visuals and the incredible new soundtrack by Shiro Sagisu, the combination make up for some of the most incredible battle scenes in any movie ever, you have to see and hear it to believe it.<br /><br />The film ends in such a way that your guess is as good as mine as to what's going to happen in the next installment, actually there's a teaser trailer showing Asuka in space... Evangelion 3.33 is scheduled for release in Japan this fall, which means it will be a lonnnnnggggg wait before we can purchase the DVD in the states.<br /><br />Here's a list of everything you get with this DVD purchase:<br /><br />-A 16 page booklet which includes official artwork, character profiles, etc.<br />-US cast commentary, quite entertaining for those who enjoyed the dub (me)<br />-A short making of feature \\"Rebuild of Evangelion 2.02\\" which shows a bit of the animation process, there is no dialogue.<br />-Previews, TV spots, and trailers<br />-4 Omitted scenes in storyboard format<br />-remixed scene, \\"Tsubasa wo Kudasai\\"<br />-English and Japanese audio and subs<br /><br />Suggested rating: R for intense violence, nudity, and language (dub)
B00631VJLE|5.0|This is a killer album. The songs are hell of awesome great (indescribable). The bonus DVD? I've never been so scared of Cristina. This deluxe version also comes with free poster (bigger pic of front cover, wtf?), guitar pick, tampon and what-nots. Honestly, I think a lot fans would rather have additional bonus tracks. Some other bands not only include bonus tracks but also a live dvd. That is what we call a deluxe version. Overall it still deserves a five star.
B0030ZOYJ0|4.0|Evangelion 1.11 is basically a retelling of the Neon Genesis Evangelion TV series ep1-6 with very few deviations from the original. Of course, this is a decade newer with a much larger budget, so the animation quality itself is vastly superior, spectacular by every sense of the word. If I have any complaints they are that this new version simplifies the characters and their faults (in my opinion, the crowning achievement of the original show) and instead focuses more on action and intense battle scenes. However, this directorial decision also makes the whole thing more streamlined and accessible for the average anime fan. Finally, the English dub of this film is fantastic, practically as good as the original Japanese audio and that's saying something!<br /><br />Here's a list of everything you get with this DVD purchase:<br /><br />-A 16 page booklet which includes official artwork, character profiles, etc.<br />-A short making of feature \\"Rebuild of Evangelion 1.01\\" which shows a bit of the animation process, there is no dialogue and there are two versions featuring different musical pieces<br />-Previews, news flashes, and trailers<br />-\\"Angel of Doom\\" music video (wonderful new musical composition by Shio Sagisu)<br />-English and Japanese audio and subs<br /><br />Suggested rating: PG-13 for violence and brief nudity
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|this game is like a lot of old games but if there r any old guys out there this game is for u. also I have radiant poop that won me 50$.
B001I45UFC|5.0|CS Lewis does a great job developing the land and its people. Readers are drawn into this world by distinct and palpable characters. The nuances of each emotional response make you feel like these things really took place. And perhaps they really did. :-) One remarkable emotion I felt reading this book was: a blend of anticipation and thrill.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|from new to the game or well seasoned u will like<br /><br /> this game I give it a ten out of ten love it
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Nice game. Great retro feel. No FC issues. (SGSII Epic Touch)  I expect to play many hours on this game in coming weeks.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I like MARVEL works.  Thor is entertaining, romantic, adventure, some humor, and the hero is all man, loves a mortal woman and, supports a female warrior of ASGARD to help the male warriors on equal footing in battle. He is a gentleman for the mortal he loves and a fierce warrior against the enemy. The product arrived on time as has other AMAZON products ordered.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was ok... I liked it until the up date...... it lost ALL of my progress.  but the games are very fun! I was just a little upset when that happend.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Going nuts is fun, awesome and crazy. The only thing in the free version is that its just that its not so great because the graphics are horrible and the the store items are cheesy. That's all I have to say.
074356619X|3.0|This is an excellent prodcut for the money. I listen to it in the car while I am driving to work. It's a bit complex and confusing but I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good CD for positive motivation
0307352145|5.0|This book should be read by everyone whoever apologized for staying home from social events!  It is well researched and an excellent resource for parents with quiet children. Finally someone who sings the praises of quiet reflection and spending time alone.  Thank you Susan!
0812974611|3.0|Robert Harris is a British author known for such futuristic novels as 'Fatherland\\". He has also authored three books on ancient Roman history: \\"Pompeii\\"; \\"Imperium\\" and Conspirata\\" (the latter two novels deal with the life of Cicero the famous orator of the late republic era.\\")<br />  The Plot of Pompeii: Marcus Attilius Primis is a young \\"aqueduct\\" who comes from a long line of engineers able to design and repair aqueducts. Aqueducts were vital to the growth of the Roman Empire providing water to Rome and cities throughout the vast Pax Romana. Attilius is summoned to the area of the Campagna where there is severe damage to the acqueduct in the area.<br />Pompeii is one of the cities built around a resort for the wealthy of Rome to enjoy life and relax by the shore of the lovely and warm Mediterranean Sea. Attilius is a recent widower having lost his wife who died in childbirth along with the newborn baby. While on assignment in Pompeii, Attlius falls in love with Corelia. The fetching beauty is being forced into a marriage with a wealthy older man chosen by her despicable father Her father is Ampliatus a former slave who has made a fortune by buying and selling real estate in Pompeii following an earthquake seventeen years before the opening of the novel. Ampliatus is a corrupt former slave who is not adverse to murder and intrigue to remain in his cosy estate. He is a cruel man who sends slaves to be slaughtered by man eating in a pool on his property! The best part of the predictable tale of love and danger is the famous Vesuvius earthquake of August 24-25 79 AD. The earthquake claimed 2,000 lives. Chapters devoted to Admiral Pliny the famous Roman scientist are interesting.<br />  The book is well written and researched However, I found the characters to be cardboard figures who lacked the spark of life. A nice book but nothing great!
B00425S1H8|5.0|Since I am a technology professional, responsibility of running the software for the annual Cub Scout Pinewood Derby defaulted to me.  So I went to setup the track and do a test, I found that they are using a hardware device called a timekeeper pro and software from Lisano enterprises called Grad Prix Race manager.  The challenge was, that I am a MAC guy, and this device has a RS232 Serial interface. For that matter 95% of the laptops today do not have a serial interface.<br /><br />To make matter even more unique, the software only runs on windows.  So I was able to connect this adapter to a MAc Book Pro, running VMWare Fusion, running Windows 8 preview.  Installed the drivers, then changed to COM3 and everything worked perfectly.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product as it resolved the challenge I was faced with.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I love it! Its a perfect, glowy, updated version of the game we all spent too many quarters on.  Quit reading reviews and start playing this game!
B005GUQIDC|5.0|I suppose that I am one of the first buyers of this album in germany. It is not yet for sale over here, but thanks to amazon.com I now have the privilege to listen to Kimbra every day. \\"Settle down\\" can be heard sometimes on the radio, but that's only one the many faces of Kimbra's music. I first noticed her as a featuring background voice in \\"Somebody I used to know\\", and I was mesmerized by the amount of feeling that Kimbra puts into the song, using hands, body, and of course her magnificent voice. The album is awesome, very well produced, many different styles, sometimes Grace Jones, sometimes Kate Bush, then there's some swing, soul, funky, avantgarde etc. etc. Kimbra, please go on and give us more of your music.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Or, the best concept album of all time.<br /><br />Along with The Incident, In Absentia and Light Bulb Sun this album is just a remarkable musical delicacy. It's so well made, in every respect, that it doesn't even feel right to attempt breaking its virtues into sub-categories like musicianship, mixing & mastering, lyrics etc.<br /><br />Fear of a Blank Planet is sophisticated alright, but it's nevertheless listenable, melodically healthy rock music (unlike certain progressive/alternative people, who frequently find it necessary to veer into cacophony, emotional swamps, acoustic hallucinations and musical sadism).<br /><br />We listened to the whole album without track skipping (which is what you have to do when you listen to vinyl). We certainly did ourselves a favor!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|upgrade the same weapon and you will beat the game faster. I used the laser and beat it in about 30 mins. this game has an awesome replay experiance and will play again. just like the old galaga but tweaked to be beaten on a more smooth and less glitchy platform.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|A game that is self.conscious enough to have the characters use a saying &quot;mindlessly shooting forward&quot; in reference to the games mechanics is charming. It works. The rest of the game is solid casual fun, cool upgrades, and light arcade fun. A definite get.
0385342063|5.0|Sometimes I crave a light, fluffy book and Sophie Kinsella truly delivered this time around. I picked this up at 8am on Saturday morning and finished by 7pm before heading out to dinner. The new heroine Poppy is truly fun and you find yourself cheering for her and laughing out loud. Loved the premise and the ending. Highly recommended. While I did enjoy reading it on a snowy day in CT, I would have loved to save it for a summer afternoon by the pool! Thanks for a great read, Sophie K! :)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I enjoy playing this game but the resolution on Android is nowhere near as good as on the iphone. Oh
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a must see DVD  Beautiful American history lesson. It should be mandatory for all teenage children.  They maybe would love their country more.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I think all you tbolt users need to update your firmware, worked flawlessly on mine. Beyond that It's a decent retro style arcade shooter.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I got this cuz it was priced right. It showed up a day or two after Amazon said gottcha would. So if was wanted something in a hurry would not get something through most companies, this is one. But for I just want that, I would get whatever. The said what it was and that's what I got all for a good price.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Also the story is much more engaging to be honest. The first episode of the first season was not nearly as good as this first episode.<br /><br />Spartacus has become something different. Stop moaning about it and move with it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is Great and that's all that can describe it.Its obvious that this is all a good product. Awesome and I love it.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|And i've seen all of them.  I've seen HBO's previous efforts and while i enjoyed some of them this is a step above. A large step.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong it's not for everybody.  But if you have some imagination then you'll love it.<br /><br />Some people don't have any imagination and so they give it a little flack.<br /><br />Seriously watch this show.
B0059XTTW8|4.0|Well done adaptation of a legendary classic of the genre. The dreadful atmosphere, the narrative thread and the outstanding performances of Oldman, Firth and Hurt are a treat.<br /><br />A movie that will show you how the things were going in a recent past, after 23 years of having collapsed that \\"fist of iron\\" regime.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I've not bought the blu-ray of season 2 yet but I will.  I have the prequel and season 1.  I'm a big fan and was devastated when I heard Andy Whitfield was ill and then died.  He was perfect for this role.  He was awesome. The new guy is doing ok.  If he was the original Spartacus I'm thinking we'd all be saying he's awesome but Andy set such a high bar I don't think anybody could have matched or bettered him.  Anyway.  Season 2 in my opinion is a little different to season 1 for me.  I liked seeing the gladiators being trained, fighting in the area and seeing the twisted plots unfold in the house of Batiatus.  Now that season 2 is out in the open with so many different locatnions it's obviously not the same.  However, season 2 has got better and better with each episode.  Last Fridays.... I think episode 5... was the best episode yet!  I was yelling OMG! and my girlfriend was screaming!!!  really she was.  When Ganacus comes back and enters the arena only to fight against....????? I was shocked!  But there was so many other jaw dropping moments in this episode the 59 minutes(?) just flew by. I was mentally drained.... how often can you say that after watching a show?!  It was like seeing Star Wars in 1977.... you left the theatre thinking 'wow... did I just see what I think I did....no way!' and then you'd talk to everybody you knew about it for weeks and weeks....  well my work colleagues will be getting an ear full tomorrow.  This last episode was that good!<br /><br />This show continues to amaze me.  Half way through the season and the characters are all in place, the plots are thickening and you know the twists are coming too.  I'm not a big fan of the new Navia either...the other girl was excellent.... but all in all...this second season delivers and delivers BIG.  I highly recommend watching it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. To me it is close to angry birds it's so adicting. Don't think twice buy this game. It's one of my favorite games on my kindle.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|Given the number of phones that seem to have issues with this application I don't think it is the phones fault. this game most likely is just old and needs its code updated to work with current phones.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Crashes when I try to open it, looks like a pretty lame game anyway. Ya can't always go by looks but in this case it fits. Don't waste your time. I think ths game is made for older, slower platforms.
B00005JO5L|4.0|Heavy movie with Al Pacino.  Filmed in 1979 and released in early 1980.  It is a time in America before the 1980 election and AIDS.  Set in the S/M club scene of New York.  Pacino has to catch a killer of gay men.  Keep that in mind when watching this movie.  Alot of people will be uncomfortble with this movie.  Leave your thoughts at the door when puting it in the dvd player.
0439023513|4.0|I'm not going to write a dissertation here like most people tend to do with reviews.  I'll keep it brief.<br /><br />I really thought Mockingjay was thought-provoking, disturbing, tragic, and extremely suspenseful.  Like the other 2 books, I couldn't put it down.  I'm also not a tween (although my daughter is and she likes these books more than Harry Potter... I don't agree with that however).  I was really surprised when reading all the negative comments about this book.  I was prepared to hate it!  The opposite.  I really loved it and feel that I went on an incredible journey along with Katniss.<br /><br />I think Katniss is a strong protagonist (completely opposite of Bella in Twilight), and although this book is so different than the first two, it was equally powerful.  There are no spoilers here.  I don't think this book was predictable at all, and I was very surprised by the many twists and turns.<br /><br />This is a book about war, and it's not pretty.  I am very satisfied with how the characters ultimately live their lives, and the choices they make.  I think that Katniss was able to somewhat come to terms with her demons, and her inner turmoil was very realistic and heartbreaking.
B00008K7AM|5.0|This is one of Rob's best films.  Most of the movies about switching bodies or minds arn't that good.  This one is great.  It can be watched over and over.  The acting and story are great.  His best work.

B0045D3N3O|4.0|Man, I had sold my 2-disc DVD in order to add this to my BD collection and replace my DVD's with BDs (still waiting on the Shaft films and Suplerfy with surround sound!), but last year this got pushed back because their was a rights issue with Sam cooke songs in the film.  They have it together now and I gather this is why this is priced higher.  I would have waited until it came down, but I figured I would snatch it up in case something else came up!<br /><br />Let me start by saying that this comes in ones of those digibooks and this one is different from previous types.  This has the two discs attached to the covers of the book while the book pages are in the center.  This is strange I maybe it was done because it was two discs. The book IS of a higher quality than the others with embossed titles, so at least you think that you are getting some of your money's worth.  The back has the disc specs on it and it is stuck on better than previous digibooks, but I still do not understand why they cannot just print it on the back cover so that we will never lose it!<br /><br />The movies is the same, the extras are the same as the 2-disc DVD, which is a good thing!  the main thing was they the Malcolm X documentary from the DVD set was included here as well.  It would have been nice if it could have been HD...  They made the making of in an HD-like look or they just letter-boxed it, so why not make a FILM feature in widescreen? All in all, this really just an HD replacement of the 2-disc DVD.<br /><br />AUDIO: I watched this film hundreds of times since I first saw it when it came out.  I can almost recite it line for line and I am very familiar with the scenes and people in this film as well as the sound.  I always thought that Malcolm X had one of the better surround sound effects on DVD and for this largely dialog driven film, and the same startling soundtrack transfers over to Blu-Ray - with upgraded sound.  Of course the quality is better and the best example of thesound is when Malcolm X begins his first duties preaching on the Harlem streets with Al Sharpton and Bobby Seale.  THAT is a perfect use of surround sound panning and it stayed precise!  THIS is the type of surround sound that ALL movies should have.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />PICTURE:  If you already owned the DVD, then you are more than aware of how clean and clear the picture is.  It is so nice looking that when you watch it, you find it hard to believe that twenty years have passed!  The first DVD release of Malcolm X was on a single side, dual-layer disc that was perfect for what I liked - seeing the DVD cover art.  That disc, I knew, was stretching it to the limits because of the running time, but it made do.  The second release spread the film out over two discs which I hate, but when the film is three plus hours long, I can deal with it more.  The picture quality was maximized for DVD and it showed.<br /><br />Now with this Blu-Ray, I was always wondering what improvements could be made on the picture quality since it was already stellar.  I assume that it would appear more film-like and I was not expecting too much more in the way of details.  For the most part that is what you get here, although I have not viewed the DVD in over a year so I am going by memory.  You do see film grain - mainly through the early part of Malcolm's life, before he was sent to prison.  I believe that the grain and slightly smoother look was a style choice kind of like JFK.  Once Malcolm becomes an official Nation of Islam member, the picture is as crisp and as clean as you expect it to be.  This film quality always made me say that this is the reason that directors should not make the jump to straight digital FILMING just yet, as film can be scaled into the future better unlike a digital file.<br /><br />The truth is, you do see more details, but it is not the difference between night and day like most DVD to BD's are.  I better noticed the rubber on Denzel's fake goatee and marks on faces than in the past (I also have a larger TV now too!)and the zoot suits patterns are clear and you can make out exactly what they are and the colors do not stick.<br />5/5<br /><br />Is it an upgrade?  Of course it is, but it is not a light speed jump ONLY because the source material was so good to begin with!  Now, of course this is the best quality Malcolm X you will get on ONE DISC with supreme sound.  If you have the single disc DVD of X, then get this.  If you have the 2-disc set and you do not like having one film over two discs, then get this.  If you want it is loss-less surround sound - get this!<br /><br />Now Warner Brothers, PLEASE give me the Shaft movies and Superfly with remastered soundtracks in surround sound!  I also want the Bruce Lee films on BD edited (why not?) and the sound all-new!  It is not as if those HAVE to be as they were.  Someone do it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it everyday for my dailly reading and very much enjoy listening to it as I read along too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I use this game for long waits in line and mindless busy activity on car rides etc. they are simple flash games and varied enough for me to keep occupied but not totally engrossed so that I can put it down when my name is called or I am spoken to.

B004I8WD6E|3.0|I've tried a few different cases for my white iPhone 4, and this is probably the second best design I've used. The case I was using previously to this was the elago s4 glide case, but I wanted to try a clear case that showed more of Apple's design.<br /><br />I like the look of this case, including the circular patter on the back. The case isn't bulky, and I thought provided plenty of protection from small drops. I actually dropped my phone while using the case down a few carpeted stairs and landing on a hard tile floor. There were no noticeable marks or scuffs.<br /><br />So what I don't like, and why I'm back now using my elago s4 glide is more about how the case feels in my hand. Maybe I'm too picky about this, but your phone spends so much time in your hand that it's important how it physically feels. So the TPU material is basically vinyl, or at least if feels like it. It's not \\"hard\\" like a plastic shell, but not as soft as silicon. It might absorb a little more energy from a drop than hard plastic would, but I prefer the feel of hard plastic. Also, and more importantly for me, the way this case was manufactured leaves an edge running along the whole back side. It's not sharp, but definitely apparent when the phone is cradled in your hand. I used a rotary tool like a Dremel to dull it a little which helped, but not completely solving the problem. I guess I got used to (and really like) the curved corners and rounded edges of the elago s4 glide-- makes using a case with more defined edges rather uncomfortable to use.<br /><br />So my gripes are minor really, but are kind of a deal breaker since maybe I'm more sensitive to those edges than most. If this is your first case on your iPhone, I think it would be pretty great, especially for Amazon's low price. If you're like me and put a high value on the feel of a case in your hand, you might want to pass on this.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a fantastic book.  I bought it on my Kindle about a month ago and I have already reread it twice.  The characters were so believable.  I could picture Travis in my mind and I loved the way the \\"tough guy\\" was able to be vulnerable and show his emotions.  The ending made me smile.  I love when I finish a book and it makes me feel good.  I only paid $2.99 for the book, but it was worth much more.

B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Like many folks, FC on Bionic, even after restart and reinstall. Please fix so I can give a proper review.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just reread this book; this is the first time in years I have chosen to read any book for the second time.  There's good reason for this, namely that this is one of those books that makes the rest of your world come to a halt so that you can finish it.<br /><br />The central figure of the book is Katniss, a teenaged girl who has to sneak into the woods to hunt in order to keep her family fed in this distopian future.  She lives in a fenced-in coal mining district, one of 12 that exist solely to serve the Capital.  Life in her district is one of struggle for basic sustenance and survival.  What emerges from these conditions is a girl of strength and fierce independence.  She is certainly a flawed character, yet her awareness (and overestimation) of her own flaws is part of what makes Katniss so compelling.<br /><br />Katniss has had to use violence to survive, namely through bow hunting.  When she steps into the titular Hunger Games and has to fight other humans to the death, this acclimation to violence becomes her saving grace, even while it battles with her innate compassion.  There is romance here, but the romance does not consume her, this is not a story of a girl who loses herself to love.<br /><br />Anyone who has young daughters, I highly recommend giving this book to your children as soon as they are old enough to handle the violence.  Katniss, living as she does in a distopian world, can't be a role model exactly, but she can provide young girls with the knowledge that they are far more than just who they date and how pretty they are.  This book shows the value of inner strength tempered with self-reflection and compassion.<br /><br />We may live in a world far removed from District 12, but it is one where violence still exists and valor is still occasionally needed.  I would keep this on the shelf right next to the Handmaid's Tale to remind us to appreciate the freedoms we enjoy and remain ever wary of what we could become.  And also, because it's nice to have a few days where you're not even tempted to turn on your TV.o have a few days where you're not even tempted to turn on your TV.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is incredibly simple, yet fun. I thought that it didn't save at first because there was no options menu that you can pull up to save games midway. After playing and stopping and coming back to the game I realized that it saves and you just start off where you finished. Changed from 4 to 5 stars now. Love this game. Reminds me of arcade games when I was a child.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|this app is a waste of time don't get it, to me this could the worst app on the kindle plus there is to many adds
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 7 year old daughter loves Angry Birds. She loves to get her hands on our smart phones or tablet to play. I am a stickler for not wanting her to have too much screen time and love to find fun things for us to do together so this was perfect. It brings to fun of Angry Birds to a family activity.<br /><br />My biggest/only complaint is that my daughter took the pieces out of the box the first time and we couldn't get them back in correctly again. They wouldn't all fit. It would be nice to have a diagram of how you can get them all in the plastic mold. It would also be cool to have expansion packs where you could buy extra pieces and cards for bigger game boards.

B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Whether it's the \\"true\\" story of Robin Hood or not, I loved this movie! I didn't go into it expecting it to be the true to history story like most other reviewers apparently did so I wasn't let down as they were. The real story of Robin Hood will probably never be known so why make such a huge deal over it? Just enjoy the tale- this movie will make it easy. Since I enjoyed the movie so much I tried to order this set from Amazon. It was my very first order from Amazon and things seemed to go well. The process was easy, the price was excellent, the order even arrived early... with the wrong movie in the box. They shipped me Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. A decent movie- but not what I ordered & paid for. The returns process was easy and the customer service people nice- but I didn't want to have to use that service. I still haven't gotten this movie to own as I'm not sure I want to take the chance that I'll be shipped the wrong thing again.

1451627289|1.0|BUS STATION PAPERBACK NOVEL Have not read a \\"bus station paperback novel\\" since I went from station to station in the late 60s when I was in the military. This tripe qualifies. Could not care less about the Kennedy stuff and how \\"things would have been different if he had not been killed\\" (read any newsmag of the time and you will know the guy was in deep trouble with the electorate before he died)---WAS looking for the \\"cross country adventure\\"---and found nothing. From the first chapter its evident King is looking for a vehicle to promote his libdem agenda---I doubet the guy even visited Texas (among the most ludicrous is examples the \\"smell of oil from Odessa-Midland ((in Texas we say Midland Odessa)) in Dallas\\" Thats over 300 miles away--similar to someone in NYC smelling the steel mills in Pittsburgh back in the 60s!!! This is a political book and I definitely suggest most of the four and five star reviews were written by those who share Kings political feelings. Poorly written,terrible plot, HORRIBLY researched--and the \\"cross country adventure\\" is ridiculous.

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|Five strangers are trapped in an elevator of a Philadelphia office building. Just before this accident happens, someone apparently jumped off from the same building and died. A police detective Bowden (Chris Messina) with a tragic past is sent to the scene to discover that there is some mysterious power at work behind the two seemingly unrelated incidents.<br /><br />The film's original story is written by M. Night Shyamalan, which is later developed by Brian Nelson, writer of a thriller \\"Hard Candy\\" starring Ellen Page. Being the first part of \\"The Night Chronicles,\\" \\"Devil\\" is less a straightforward horror movie than an Agatha Christie-esque occult mystery. With Tak Fujimoto's moody photography and the effective score of Fernando Velázquez (\\"The Orphanage\\"), \\"Devil\\" is atmospheric, if not very scary.<br /><br />What disappointed me is not Shyamalan's concept, which I think is not as interesting as other reviewers, but still has potential for a solid thriller or suspense. But it seems directors John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle (\\"Quarantine\\") are so busy with the film's visual aspects (which are respectable, I admit) that they forget to provide convincing back story for each character, something that plays the central role in the storyline.<br /><br />In short, with cardboard characters we really don't care, the process of finding out \\"why them\\" is not that interesting in \\"Devil.\\" As to \\"what happens and how,\\" we know who is to blame, and in case you have forgotten the film's title, a security guard steps in and explains everything ... well, not exactly everything, but anyway, by the time the film ends, we don't know why this elaborate setup is needed.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|Schindler's List(released Dec/93)was deservedly the big winner of the /93-/94 OSCAR race with seven statuettes awarded.It boasts a powerhouse cast with the likes of Liam Neeson as Oscar Schindler,Ben Kingsley as his Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern,Ralph Fiennes as the sadistic camp commandant Amon Goeth,and many ,many more.The film was shot in b&w for effect,which beautifully served to heighten the intensity and emotion this movie produced.The story is of course based on facts,hard to believe facts in this day and age,but nonetheless they stand as testimony to the brutality(and corruption)of the German WW2 war machine.From the script to the acting to the film's entire execution(no pun intended)on film,it is flawless.Schindler in reality was no saint and in fact a womanizer(he was married during this period),a drunk and a poor businessman.But what in the beginning began as an attempt at selfish monetary gains through bribery and pressure,turned into an honest attempt to save as many Jews as he could in his factories,at an unbelievable personal risk.By the time the film comes to its inevitable conclusion you will,guaranteed,have shed a few tears during some of the many very touching moments.<br />Technically the film is in its original a/r of 1:85:1 and the picture is crisp and clear.This edition I review is the newest incarnation which celebrates Universal's 100th anniversary.As such there is an outer cover which opens at the front,which the regular DVD case just slips into.This edition is also,unfortunately,a one disc version.This is the only criticism of this DVD,that for a 100th anniversary release,Universal would choose to cheaply put this film onto a double sided DVD;prone to all the scratching and scuff marks one could ask for.This film,along with any other so called anniversary release,deserves much better.Extras include the usual from previous releases of this DVD such as the Shoah Foundation and Voices from the List featurettes,along with some true facts on Schindler himself.<br />In conclusion I can't say I approve of the manner in which this DVD has been released,but it is the film that is most important,and for that it gets all five stars;it's worth more.This is a film EVERY person in the world should be shown,and most importantly children and history students.This film is just one of the countless reasons that we should NEVER,EVER forget that period,that terrible period in our collective history.Highly recommended.chindler himself.<br />In conclusion I can't say I approve of the manner in which this DVD has been released,but it is the film that is most important,and for that it gets all five stars;it's worth more.This is a film EVERY person in the world should be shown,and most importantly children and history students.This film is just one of the countless reasons that we should NEVER,EVER forget that period,that terrible period in our collective history.Highly recommended.

1451627289|5.0|11/22/63  by Stephen King<br /><br />Is Stephen King God? He creates new worlds that seem like our own, at first, then populates them with creatures -- human and inhuman -- bestowed with powers and problems that complicate their lives in otherworldly ways that seem perfectly believable.<br /><br />Like God, he conjures characters we grow to love and root for, and then cruelly kills them off, but in his latest novel, 11/22/63, he exercises his god-like powers to bring back to life the ones he chooses to resurrect.<br /><br />Reading a Stephen King novel is like being blind-folded and pushed through a strange doorway into a room from a different universe, but in 11/22/63, the doorway is a portal that drops the hero, Jake Epping, a high school English teacher, back in time to September, 1958, over and over again.<br /><br />Wouldn't you like to be able to travel back into the past to a simpler time, knowing what you know now (like next year's Kentucky Derby winner), and try to fix things that went wrong? Jake Epping's quest takes him to Dallas in 1963, in an attempt to save JFK from assassination by Lee Harvey Oswald. But knowing Stephen King as we do, no good deed goes unpunished, and there are always consequences.<br /><br />If he hadn't titled this book, 11/22/63, the date of the original assassination of JFK, he might have named it, Life Turns On A Dime, referring to a recurring theme in the book, how seemingly inconsequential acts can have historic effects on people's lives. It might also have been titled, The Philosophy of Stephen King, since, as he ages and matures; his life philosophy continues to gel, infusing his works with his beliefs. Love conquers all.<br /><br />Stephen King is a romantic. Romance and true love fuel his characters, juxtaposed next to horrid examples of wife-beaters and murderers who epitomize hate. His characterization of assassin Lee Harvey Oswald's love for his young daughter on one hand, and his brutality toward his beautiful Russian wife, Marina, on the other, makes the reader want to cheer when he finally gets what he has coming.<br /><br />After creating fifty novels or so, one wonders how he can keep doing it, but Stephen King has done it again. I couldn't put it down.<br />Charlie Norman

B006ISJQBM|3.0|Johnny Depp once again channels his late, great friend Hunter S. Thompson in this long overdue adaptation of The Rum Diary, which while it retains the spirit of Thompson's source material, it also sadly feels somewhat watered down.  Depp plays Paul Kemp, a hard-living New York journalist that winds up in San Juan.  As he gets a feel for the local colour (and booze), Kemp comes across the shady mogul Sanderson (Aaron Eckhart) and instantly falls for his stunning fiance (Amber Heard) in the process.  Kemp's journey takes him through the good and bad of the locale and its denizens, although by the time the credits roll, you'll be left feeling a little empty inside.  The spirit of Thompson is definitely felt throughout the proceedings, but for some reason sadly it just doesn't feel one hundred percent right.  Still though, Depp is wonderful, and the rest of the cast, which also includes Richard Jenkins, Michael Rispoli, and Giovanni Ribisi in a scene-stealing role, are great.  All in all, The Rum Diary is hit and miss, and while it probably may never become the cult classic that Terry Gilliam's take on Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas did, it's still worth your time regardless.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I would really recommend this app. great for all ages. if I were you I would buy this app and then use it.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|This game works as it says that it will and is reasonably fun to play. It is just like the game style of the old Atari game systems from the 1970's. The controls work well on the Kindle Fire and the games downloaded and started up without issues. I gave this game 4 Stars as it played like it said it would and offered a lot of levels and upgrades as you gain points.<br /><br />I am not a fan of the old style of games as they are just outdated when compared to today's standards for games and the devices we play them on. I will not leave this on my Kindle Fire as there are better games with better graphics that I will keep. While I commend the developers for a good game, it is just not for me.

B004O4K4SQ|1.0|For those who think Superman75 should be banned - like Nikki and Glen - should consider the fact the person is actually very talented. I, along with my friend, have assumed he's a writer somewhere. I would love to see others bring something as interesting to these boring reviews such as, it will not work with my phone, I don't like the controls, it's overpriced (which is silly since it's free when you are downloading it).<br /><br />Some people need to be less uptight about dealings of life.<br /><br />As far as the game, I didn't like it all. This is 2012, so any mix of retro isn't appealing to me.
B003YCI1PM|5.0|The songs are amazingly well written. And I totally make that something I listen to on a regular routine. Very well done! Selena Rocks.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Okay guys, this game, is NOT your average space invaders game. It goes way past it with RPG elements in the weapon upgrade system, a diverse array of weapons, clever dialogue and storyline and AMAZING GRAPHICS. I played this on my Kindle Fire and these screenshots DOES NOT do this amazing game justice.<br /><br />It's insanely addictive and is definitely worth $2.<br /><br />The art style behind it, the beautiful selection of colors, the pixelated old school awesome is well preserved in this modern remake of space invaders and the classic vertical side scrolling shooter<br /><br />Expect tons of hours of gameplay because this GAME ROCKS!
B006X9EUUS|3.0|I am not sure why this album has garnered such great reviews. I have adored Sinead since her Lion & the Cobra, and nearly everything since. She is at her best when she reaches deep and lets her vocals fly, and this is not one of those albums. If you like the more \\"breathy\\" Sinead songs, then this is for you. Regrettably, this album will be more of background music while I'm cleaning than anything else.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I don't get some of these reviews like the one about. wtf does your pizza issues got to do with this app? Amazon needs to ban those types from being allowed to review apps because they. don't take it serious at all.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've been using this for over a year and I felt that it's time to put in a review. First and foremost I got mine for $134.99 through the Amazon Gold Box deal a year ago. Now the device, at first glance the device looked intimidating. I thought it was going to be a nightmare to set up but setting up the Garmin Forerunner 405CX was easy. The quick start guide supplied with the Garmin Forerunner 405CX was simple and easy to understand. Before using the heart rate function, I found out that it was necessary to pair the Garmin Forerunner 405CX with the heart rate monitor that came with it. Once paired, I then need to pair it with the wireless USB dongle. The wireless USB dongle actually allowed me to transfer all my workout data wirelessly to the computer by simply bringing the watch within 3m of the wireless USB dongle.<br /><br />Using the Garmin Forerunner 405CX was simple enough, although it did take me some time to figure out the menu and navigation using the quirky touch sensitive bezel. Once I had the Garmin Forerunner 405CX configured the operation was pretty simple, much like many of Garmin's other products. I have a Garmin Edge cycling computer on my bike so I had no trouble getting the hang of this Garmin Forerunner 405CX. Loading workout data onto your computer is mostly effortless. After creating an account with Garmin Connect, I was nstructed to bring your watch to within 9 feet of my computer (with the USB Ant stick plugged in) to transfer data. Once the data is loaded, the Garmin Connect web site does a fantastic job of displaying all of the information in a very easy to read format.<br /><br />Perhaps the only complaint I have with this Garmin Forerunner 405CX is the touch bezel interface. While I did eventually get used to it, it would constantly rub against my wrist, changing the mode I was in. After becoming familiar with the Garmin Forerunner 405CX I found that you can lock the bezel, eliminating this problem. I think it would have been nice to have the bezel lock itself after a minute or so. Otherwise, after a year of use it's still working well and I'm very satisfied with this purchase.the bezel lock itself after a minute or so.

0307719219|3.0|My worst subject in college, economics struck me as either childishly obvious or as impenetrably arcane.  For example, the classic definition of price - where the supply curve meets the demand curve - in the abstract seems tautological, but how in heaven's name does one derive either curve?  Also, the units seem to change.  Dollars per what?  Number of widgets per what?  Furthermore, this definition has limitations when one considers that current rising supplies of oil to steady or falling demand does not lead to falling prices.<br /><br />You can state the book's thesis easily.  A sufficiently centralized government of inclusive, pluralistic political institutions reinforces inclusive economic institutions (a so-called \\"virtuous circle\\").  Exclusionary, extractive (ie, exploitive) political institutions reinforce extractive economic institutions (a \\"vicious circle\\").  A chaotic, decentralized polity tends to foster local extractive elites and economic markets and cannot establish the rule of law, especially equality before the law, the protection of property rights, and so on, necessary for general economic incentive or inclusive economic institutions.  In cases where extractive political institutions try to foster inclusive markets, as in the Peoples' Republic of China, we can show that such initial prosperity cannot be sustained.  The rest of the book consists of historical illustrations.<br /><br />You would think that a link between politics and economics would be mind-numbingly obvious, but apparently not among economists.  Acemoglu and Robinson spend the first part of the book demolishing various competing theories:  climate determinism, education levels, modernization, among others.  I did like very much the authors' emphasis that propitious conditions are historically contingent, rather than determined.<br /><br />The book has received a chorus of praise from both conservative and liberal economists.  The conservatives like the authors' emphasis on democratic institutions and free markets as essential for general prosperity, as well as the approval of both the British and American economies that runs through the book.  I'm not sure exactly what the liberals like, unless it's the role of government in markets.<br /><br />However, why is it that you can make a case for social scientists as a class - along with New Agers and politicians - as in the running for the Worst Writers in the World?  The sentences are at best utilitarian, at worst downright ugly.  In its current form, this is one bloated, repetitious book, at least 100 pages too long.  The organization is such that the book reads like a set of bagpipes slowly blatting out air.  The authors make no attempt to build an argument over the long haul.  Instead, they make their argument at the beginning and then keep remaking it.  It reminds me of the awful old teacher's dictum:  \\"Tell them.  Tell them again.  Summarize what you told them.\\"  The structure should have been more dynamic, building from point to point over the long haul, so that the reader gets a sense of discovery, a sense of payoff at the end.<br /><br />Even more interesting is what the authors *don't* say.  In general, I agree with their points about the reinforcing properties of the virtuous and vicious circles.  Inclusive and extractive institutions tend to stay that way.  However, they cite examples where vicious circles have been broken - Brazil, for example - and if true for vicious circles, why not for virtuous ones?  Consider, for example, that US voting rights are being restricted in various states under the false banner of voter fraud and that it takes millions to run for federal office, most of which is now supplied by a handful of very, very rich people.  Consider that the American middle class continues to be gutted as more and more (even the educated, or at least degreed) fall into poverty levels.  Consider that these situations have been prolonged and indeed encouraged by legislative unwillingness in both major parties to annoy the funding sources that perpetuate a political class, increasingly above many of the laws the general population is subject to.  I have no idea what the answer to any of this is.  I do believe that I cannot trust the political establishment, Republican or Democratic, to work toward a solution, since they have obfuscated rather than meaningfully legislated.  We may have to follow the Brazilian model:  set up local inclusive institutions, network with other places, and gradually build a political movement from the ground up.  The Tea Party and Occupy I think were broken attempts at this.  The Tea Party quickly became co-opted.  Occupy never recognized the need for stronger organization.<br /><br />At any rate, I believe the US is rapidly moving toward exclusionary politics and extractive economics.  We can hide, but we can't run - either away or for office.
B004C6QDCW|5.0|Fantastic voice, such a gift, I love listening to it, Simply amazing! One of the best vinyl I've bought recently. Listening to it on my Thorens TD125 Mark II turntable and Adele is simply amazing. You really have to listen to the album in order to appreciate them properly. \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" should be your first stop, and you have to make sure you listen to the songs in the track order. Make sure you set aside time and try your best to listen to the album without pausing and without any interfering noise at all. It's magic the first time you do that. If you have a turntable, buy the vinyl format and if you listen to it while you've got the right vibe going on it'll seriously impact you in an extremely positive way. Oh and the vinyl also gets you a free digital download of the full album.
B000000OPZ|5.0|Simply one of the best hard rock albums ever recorded with fantastic performances in particular from Coverdale and Sykes. Some of the vocals on this album are the best you will ever hear.<br /><br />It is one of those records that sounds timeless, as all quality music always does. I just cannot fathom the 1 and 2 star reviews (admittedly by far in the minority) as this is really one of my ten 'desert island' CDs.<br /><br />My favourite tracks are 'Crying the the Rain' (epic) 'Still of the Night', 'Give me all your love tonight' and 'Looking for Love'....but really, there isn't a dud track on this thing.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie it takes me back to the old Planet of the Apes movies.<br />It kind of works in to how it all started.  I hope they will continue the story.<br />Anyone who is an old sci-fi movie buff will enjoy this.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|what can i say...this one of the best remakes of all time. I mean just the other week I was playing the original and then this one was free today. Epic win!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Oldboy is considered the second movie in the \\"revenge trilogy\\", and is also generally considered to be the best film in it. I would have to agree. This movie explores the psychology of revenge on a level I have never seen in a film before. The acting is far above what I expected and the story twists and turns in ways that even the performers at cirque du soleil cannot. If you want to test your boundaries of revenge, and have any interest in the human mind then this movie is for you. It strips you bere down to your heart and then beats on it with two fists. When they put Tartan Asia Extreme at the top they aren't kidding. This is the mental equivelent to raw violence of I Saw the Devil. If you want a movie that will make you think, you can't regret buying this film.
1400052181|5.0|This author did an extraordinary job of taking a boring and unknown fact and making it<br />into a biography of a woman and her family along with many other characters.<br /><br />If you like facts and biographies and 'how it came to be' stories, this is a must book.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book.<br />I learned much from reading it.<br />I wanted to read it all.<br />I could have but didn't put it down.<br />It was very factual but interesting.<br />It enlightened me.<br /><br />This was a very good book.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Sam Jackson and Christina Ricci both provide strong performances in a movie about redemption and forgivness. A well created drama this movie is gripping and interesting. This is the kind of drama that makes one think about their own life and what they have done. One of my favorite dramas to date and with a killer blues soundtrack this movie is worth buying.

B00005Q4CS|5.0|Want to really scare kids off drugs? Then show them this movie, they'll never even take asprin again.<br />This movie is running on all cylinders! From the moment you turn it on you can't take your attention away from it as it slowly takes you down a rabbit hole of addiction and pain. Superbly directed by Darren Aronofsky it keeps you in your seat the whole way down. The acting is great and the art direction makes you feel like you yourself are having a bad trip. A must own movie for any film buff, but be prepared with a comedy afterwards to brighten your day otherwise you'll be wishing you never ordered it. Amazing movie, definatly worth any price!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the farther up u get the harder the games.  its a great way to pass the time.  the games I cant beat, my 12 yr old son can.
0792164903|4.0|*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*<br />This movie surprised me in that it was a ghost story which remained a ghost story all the way through. Usually when you get a movie like this it turns into a sort of Scooby Doo movie and the killer turns out to be old man Jenkins, however in Sleepy Hollow the headless horseman is a ghost, and stays a ghost. The movie rides the tale out quite well while Tim Burton takes his own spins of certain plot points they are often for the better. A solid film with decent proformances, it gave me more than I expected.
B000E5N6LG|2.0|After reading the wonderful book \\"Doc\\" for book club, my husband and I watched \\"Tombstone\\" a few days ago, and \\"Wyatt Earp\\" last night, in preparation for next week's book club meeting. To all those who say there is some controversy about which movie is better, I can put the controversy to rest: \\"Tombstone\\" is better.<br /><br />Watching \\"Wyatt Earp\\" felt like watching creaky community theater (no offense to community theater) from the opening scenes with Wyatt (Kevin Costner, with his trademark anachronistic shag/mullet hairdo) drinking a cup of coffee that is steaming like a witch's cauldron, as if the stagehands just put a lump of dry ice in the cup. With the exception of the fine Gene Hackman as the Earp father, the male leads' acting is either goofy cartoonish, or melodramatic, or wooden, or amazingly, all three at the same time. Having just watched Kurt Russell's tightly controlled and uber-masculine portrayal of Wyatt Earp in \\"Tombstone,\\" Kevin Costner's take on the same character reminded me a little of Forrest Gump, no offense to Forrest Gump, crossed with Costner's character from \\"Dances With Wolves\\" (same hairdo).<br /><br />I love Dennis Quaid, but having watched Val Kilmer's definitive portrayal of Doc Holliday in \\"Tombstone\\" just a few days before seeing Quaid's version in \\"Wyatt Earp\\" was probably completely unfair to Dennis Quaid and his cool little sunglasses, who just didn't even come close for me.<br /><br />I LOVE Westerns, but this cliche ridden movie--tight shot of bottle right before a bullet explodes it, anyone?--made me roll my eyes. To sweeten the deal, it is over three hours long!<br /><br />Recommendation: Watch \\"Tombstone\\" instead.

B005CMSDLE|1.0|Thought it might be good since Cate B. is in it but she must have needed the money. I need not repeat the very implausible story line, but I must say the movie insults your intelligence throughout, although intelligence was clearly not a key consideration by the producers for the target audience which must be people who care not a wit about impossibilities but just enjoy fast action chases with an attractive young sweet-face teenage girl who suddenly explodes into a fantastic hand-to-hand killing machine over and over - all lovely 98 pounds of her.  The only redeeming feature of going to this movie is that if it rains you're under a roof.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|A excellent galaga clone with an added story and different upgradeable weapon types. One minor annoyance is that there is no in game info on what each weapon type does. Playing the game and trying each weapon out is the way to learn.
B0071QIN00|3.0|too much glitches on kindle fire. your wheel isn't supposed to go through the track. you should updated for better physics.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|Most everything I can say about this film has been said in the numerous one star reviews. Here's the whole story in a nutshell. \\"Life's a bitch, and then you die.\\" That's it. Now you can save yourself the trouble of sitting through it. The only parts of the film that held a modicum of my attention were so depressing they were almost too difficult to watch.<br />Sorry I'm not one of the \\"intellectuals\\" who found meaning in this film. I think it's a case of the Emperor's New Clothes, where, if you don't see this as an historic film masterpiece, that you will be looked down upon as some ignorant rube who thinks \\"Transformers\\" is the greatest movie ever made.. I don't buy it. Case in point is \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\". Praised as one of the greatest epics of all time. It bored me stiff! But I digress.<br />Hey, if you were overwhelmed by this film, if it changed your entire outlook on life, great! Knock yourself out. That's why we have vanilla and chocolate. Everyone has different tastes. I, for one, attend a movie to be told a story, to voluntarily have my thought process stimulated. Not be forced to strain every brain cell I have to try to make sense of a pretentious self-indulgent potpourri of cinematic images.<br />For a truly insightful review of this film, check out \\"The Tree of Life\\" video review on YouTube. It's title is \\"Tree of Life Sucks\\". It's so funny, because it's so true.
B005T87QCI|3.0|this game is a good game but the controls are really hard and you can never win a battle in my case. If people want this they can get it and see if you can get the charactors and more.

B003MTGW80|5.0|Carlo Maria Giulini was one of the greatest conductors of the 20th century and this 6-CD set presents some of his most outstanding recordings. No one equalled Giulini in his performances of the Brahms symphonies -- especially Brahms superb 1st and 2nd symphonies which are included in this set. And no one surpassed Giulini in conducting Beethoven's magnificent \\"Eroica\\" Symphony. Giulini also excelled in conducting Schumann's Rhenish Symphony and Manfred Overture as well as Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony. All told this is an outstanding collection of great music superbly conducted -- and sold at a bargain price.

0307946711|1.0|I originally saw this book at Costco, but then found it at the library as an ebook.  Thankfully I didn't pay for it  because, to use a line from the book, if I had a receipt I'd return it.  The characters were dreadfully boring and full of themselves.  If Dexter had been my \\"friend,\\" I would have dumped his sorry ass long before 20 years passed.  And I'm sorry, but a female who waits around for a guy for 20 years while he's perfecting the ass role - that's about as pathetic as the guy.<br /><br />I will admit to a lot of skimming and flipping past pages of drivel.  I just couldn't get into rehashing every event over and over again.  It was predictable that they would get together (probably because they're the only ones who could stand each other), but the end was not expected...nor was the rehashing over everything yet again on each anniversary.<br /><br />This one is DEFINITELY NOT even close to \\"When Harry Met Sally!\\"
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded on Kndle Fire. I have no issues and its a fun way to waste time. Comes with different options.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|The game is fine, but can it really be considered high def if all the components are made out of such a small number of picture elements?

B004LROMSO|5.0|A great and gripping story, well-acted with very believable visual special effects. Arthur is portrayed as rather naive and innocent in the early part of the series where as his half-sister, Morgan very dominant, contriving and seemingly evil. As for Merlin, well Merlin is Merlin. He comes across as the controller of all. A great first season and I look forward to the next.<br />[[ASIN:B004LROMSO Camelot: The Complete First Season]]

B0063GORYU|5.0|Simple, clean interface. The ads show up just between games and can be skipped. I haven't seen any Flash ads yet, and I'm on a tablet so the ads are actually small (actual game uses the full screen). I prefer ad-supported games to be like this because you don't even see the ads while you're playing.

B004WR125O|4.0|This a must have adapter for the Onkyo receivers that are internet capable. It hooks up to you home network right away and allows you to stream music from the web. The receivers do have the option to hook directly to your network with an ethernet cable but if you're like me and have your surround sound in another room from your router then this little adapter is well worth the money.

0780747550|5.0|From the title I had no interest in reading this book initially. Then I saw the film on televison & finally read the book. What I had been missing! It showed me what the \\"difference\\" is between Catholics & Protestants in Ireland....almost like a caste system since they are both Christians but the Protestants are descended from the English & are wealthy for the most part while the Catholics are descended from the original Irish & are poor. The English got rid of them during the great potato famine by sending them off to America (sort of The Final Solution British style). McCourt tells how his destitute family actually WENT BACK to Ireland because they just couldn't make it in America. You have the shiftless , loquacious alcoholic & charming father & the poor down trodden mother. If anyone thinks poverty here is bad, only read this account of what it was like to be poor & Catholic in Ireland. The Catholic Church comes out very badly as usual by snubbing Angela & denying her sons any sort of hope for education or advancement.<br />I was so impressed with the drama & even humor in these bleakest of circumstances that I went on to read Tis & Teacher Man ...the whole trilogy.<br />You don't have to be Irish to laugh & weep at Frank growing up here.
B006L4MX0Y|2.0|I saw a screening of this film in a local cinema last night. I loved the book but I didn't like the film. I think the poor storytelling and character development don't do justice to the book. Plus the acting is bad, the \\"special effects\\" are terrible (you expect more from a film shot in 2000, even if it was low budget), and it is a very loose adaptation of the original source. I did enjoy the lighthouse scene. I don't understand all the hype about this film but maybe I'm just not familiar enough with the genre or have to learn to appreciate it. Or maybe is a film that is more enjoyable when you haven't read the book. I just cancelled my pre-order and I'm hoping one day Hollywood (Tarantino?) makes a more worthy adaptation.
B003E47HL4|5.0|Purchased this model about two months ago and am presently constructing it.  I have built many models in the past but this one is absolutely one of the best I have ever received.  Revell did a beautiful job and the price is very good.  You can also order the photoetched parts for it.  Everything fits well and am looking forward to finishing it.  (Take your time) and you will have one great model.

B005LAIGZU|5.0|I won't bother with the background of the story sine others already have.  The acting isn't Oscar worthy during scenes of discussion but the action and the recognition of what our military experiences in the heat of battle or skirmish is worthy of the word \\"heroic\\"!  I was engrossed with the story, I cared about the characters, I was aware of their extreme bravery and extensive training and I was emotionally engaged.  Pretty good formula for this movie?  Absolutely!  There was a good crowd for the matinee I attended and a word was barely spoken afterwards.  Powerful experience when you realize this reality for the chosen few who volunteer for this job.  Excellent movie.  The ending reminded me of my Dad.  God bless our troops!

B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Won't launch on a Samsung galaxy s2, it force closes every time. Can't wait for an update so I can try it.<br /><br />Updated version now works great. Very fun, thanks to the developer for updating so quickly!!
B006ON41FC|5.0|This game is so fun that its almost hard to stop playing it. DEFINITELY worth the download. I've never played a game so much before, lol.
B00000E2WH|4.0|Deutsche Gramophone is a great label with quality in every aspect. This is a great cd. Herbert von Karajan and The Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra sound in their element on this disc.<br /><br />\\"Finlandia\\" is bright and energetic. The brass and strings work to clutch the listener with an anxious almost nationalistic grip.<br /><br />In \\"The Swan of Tuonela\\" the strings are flowing and compelling with the sustain Sibelius ascribed, meanwhile, the oboe creates a character with whom listeners feel for and care about. I love the way the last minute of the work fades and flickers away like life itself.<br /><br />\\"Valse Triste\\" is light, gratifying, and congenial.<br /><br />Good day friends !
B0073LWEXK|4.0|this game was a lot of fun, its addictive and intriguing. if it lasted longer, it would be the perfect game!
B0000041Z3|4.0|A complete, succinct, cogent package ! Mazel and The Vienna Philharmonic did a top shelf job as far as I am concerned. These pieces seem polished! I don't listen to symphonies as much as other genres of classical music, but have listened to these and prefer them to Mahler.<br /><br />At times booming orchestration and vibrant strings shower the listener with memorable passages while swaying and spraying with waves of intensity. At other times the lulling and mollifying sound appeases and softens only for the listener to be reawakened again and again to tumultuous and roiling sound that is indeed Sibelius !!!!<br /><br />Good day friends !!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book has amazing, awesome, creepy pictures.<br /><br />Sadly, the story doesn't quite live up to the pictures. The author spent a lot of time clarifying how confused and angry and mixed up the protagonist is, but sadly, it was so much that I ended up confused and cranky as well.<br /><br />There is a kid, he has special powers. Those powers put him in danger. To learn to control them, he must journey until he finds a hidden school where there are others like him. In the school, everyone is caught in a time loop and cannot grow up. I think that was perhaps the creepiest part. It made me think of the child-vampire trope, where they have all the impulses of children, but decades of experience. Sadly, we didn't play with that notion much.<br /><br />Read if: you love vintage photos. You have run out of X-men stories.<br />Skip if: you want a gripping story.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I read his books when he first started publishing and enjoyed the first few, but as time went on either his writing changed or I did, because I soon grew tired of the ever increasing themes that seemed to leave reality farther and farther behind (at least to me).  So I was very leary of buying and readng this book.  However, several reviews stated that it was a change (for the better) and the subject matter and idea interested me so I finally bit.  This is book shows much more of his talent and skill as a story teller and author!  Realistic enough to at least touch on some of the questions about time travel that the story could have ignored (but in doing so would have diminshed the story GREATLY).  The ending is VERY good, even though I felt I saw some of it coming, it twisted just enough to take it from good to very good!  If this isn't his best work, then it hasn't been written yet!
0307719219|4.0|I was lucky enough to be able to review a prerelease copy of this book. I'd heard about it on the radio and it sounds very interesting so I jumped at the chance. The book aims to answer the question, why are some nations rich and some nations poor. How does it do?  It depends on what you're looking for.<br /><br />To start off, were given a couple of theories that the authors disagree with. For example, the theory that geography is the reason for nations prosperity or poverty. They then provide a short argument against those theories.  This part is not a large portion of the book.<br /><br />As I got into the meat of the book, I kept thinking it was an introduction to their thesis. I read about halfway through the book before I realized, they weren't just offering some evidence before making a bold pronouncement and then proving it. Instead, almost the entire book is evidence with very few specific claims made. For the most part, they just talk about extractive and inclusive economic elements without specifically getting into what those elements might be. If you're looking for something that sets up the target, aims you at it, and drives it home by the numbers, this isn't the book for you.  If you're a big fan of history and want to read a whole lot of information to be guided gently as to the author's conclusions, then you'll quite enjoy their approach.<br /><br />At no point reading this book was I bored. Yes there's a lot of \\"repetition\\" with similar examples of the same point and it meanders a bit to reach its arguments, but I was happily willing to go along for the ride.  I loved every single page and every bit of information they had about history, economics, and various cultures.  It was worth reading if only for the difference between the colonization of North and South America. I'd never considered some of the differences or why things turned out the way they did. The authors make a very compelling argument about the extracted nature of the governments the Spanish installed versus the (not due to altruism, but necessity) more inclusive ones started in North America and potentially explains why in some very oil-rich countries the general population is still so poor.  The historical and economic analysis of Africa was equally intriguing.<br /><br />So to reiterate, if you're looking for something that presents a concise theory both quickly and directly that's not what you'll get here.  If you're looking for something that will give you some really interesting aspects of history you may not already be familiar with and you don't mind the scenic route to the point, then you'll probably enjoy this book as much as I did.Spanish installed versus the (not due to altruism, but necessity) more inclusive ones started in North America and potentially explains why in some very oil-rich countries the general population is still so poor.

0375704027|3.0|I really loved parts of this. Some of the scenes are beautiful, and the story is sad and believable. This isn't a love story, though. It's about coming of age and mental illness, so don't read it expecting romance.<br /><br />The protagonist is flat; it's the people around him that make the story interesting. And those people kept coming to their demise, one by one, and then the story ends.<br /><br />Like I said, some parts were really beautiful, but the story got tiring. About a third of the way through I put the book down and didn't pick it up again for a few weeks. I'm glad I finished it - it was a worthwhile read - but I didn't feel compelled to stay up late reading or to read this instead of something else.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|A great, simple shooter that it's well executed and fun. Bright retro graphics and responsive game play. Awesome for the free app of the day, but I would probably pay for it if I had to.
B005HV6Y5W|3.0|I don't often encounter films that leave me genuinely baffled, but \\"The Tree of Life\\" is that rare film for which my only honest response is \\"huh?\\" I suspect that the flaw lies in my lack of cinematic sophistication. Although I consider myself a film geek and I can usually figure out the subtleties of artsy films, the film grammar and narrative style of this film elude me. I liked what I understood of the conventional portions of the film, which focus on the problematic and often discomfiting relationship between a young boy (played as an adult by Sean Penn) and his demanding, relentlessly strict 1950s-era father (played by Brad Pitt). Jessica Chastain is luminous as the wife and mother, and the film itself is a masterpiece of stunningly beautiful cinematography. But please don't ask me what the story means or how the various pieces of the film tie together, because I haven't a clue.
1439107955|5.0|Fascinating review of the history of the war against Cancer. The author has done extensive research and describes the fight against cancer, both from a professional and historical standpoint . One of the best books I have read in recent years.
B005DCJ1J6|1.0|We rented this while traveling to entertain the family.  We also shut it off part way through and were tempted to change the rating for them. It was a blatant attempt to have the writers political and moral views stamped all over us.  It was  NOT for children. Besides the subject, they had some scenes that should have been cut out if they expected kids to see it.  We both hated it.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Five stars all the way. I just have a burning question though. Who is christian's real father? Perhaps there is yet another shade of grey to come.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|This game is OK but it suffers from the same problem as many other similar apps, a lack of proper documentation.  Here, we have a wide range of weapon selections but no information on how each weapon behaves.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|it works grate and it brings back all my old game memories...you have to get it...it is best for kids 9or10 and up because it has guns and wepens and is a little bite challenging...get it on your Kendal fire
0811870413|1.0|I am an intermediate to advanced bread maker. Instructions were very detailed but not very clear. The results were not what I expected. You definnitley need the special cast iron pans they suggest. Also very time consuming to bake 2 loaves.
B006JPS1OM|3.0|ok so this game is so addicting. and G5 did amazing but after you are in the game it just ended and you had to bye the full version! was so disapointed... so I am giving a 3
B006UG90RM|5.0|\\"You can't replace this guy!\\" So said my good buddy Al after we'd listened to this album in its entirety.<br />I bought the deluxe edition after having listened to \\"Tattoo\\" online a whole bunch of times and really digging it. I figured if the rest of the CD were half that good I'd be happy. As it turns out the whole album is rockin'. \\"Heard ya missed us, we're baaack\\" indeed!<br />Van Halen's powers aren't merely undiminished, they remain a stunning band. From the instantly recognizable (and inimitable) crunch of \\"Tattoo\\" and throughout the album, they deliver the goods in spades.<br />Even after all these years and EVH-inspired shredders, the guitar playing remains jaw-dropping and the rhythm section has a swinging authority too seldom heard from rock musicians. Roth, of course, completes the picture, replete with guttural growls and trademark highly amusing wordplay--\\"trust in Allah/but tie up your camel\\" is just one of many little lyrical gems that leaven the heaviness of the music with his much-missed sparkling humor. A great deal of DLR's charm comes from his refusal to take himself too seriously.<br />Another reviewer here commented that the lyrics seemed to be rough drafts (or words to that effect). Seriously? David Lee himself once said, \\"Van Halen is a band meant to be enjoyed from the neck down\\". This is, after all, the guy who wrote the line, \\"Whoa HO! Hey you! Who said that? Baby how you been?\\" Bob Dylan won't be losing any sleep. That said, Roth actually ventures into some pointed political commentary on \\"Tattoo\\" when he sings of coal worker Uncle Danny who \\"fought for the unions/some of us still do\\". Elsewhere, on \\"Stay Frosty\\" he wisecracks and sings with his trademark élan. This CD is an immensely satisfying listen and a return to form of the first order. You won't be disappointed.<br />P.S. the DVD included (w/ the deluxe edition) of the group performing acoustically is thoroughly enjoyable, with DLR in top wiseass form.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Easy to control and fun to play. Awesome alternative to the old popular galiga game. I've only seen a couple quirks so far. If you move yourself under your finger then it takes it as a long press on the ship and opens up the weapon selection. Also while in weapon selection sliding in the direction of the desired weapon does nothing. I have to lift my finger then press on the desired weapon to choose.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|In the games from this era the pictures that indicate extra lives show how many tries AFTER this try. In this game it shows that you have one more ship, but the game over screen comes up when you die. It would be similar to having 1x lives in a Mario game, and not getting to try again with a 0x indicated.<br /><br />Pretty fun game despite ignoring common gaming conventions. The game has cool art and retro sprites, a story campaign to tie all the battles together, and an rpg style system for upgrading your guns. Kindle Fire screen is a little too sensitive, often moving my ship in the wrong direction when my finger is not in contact with the screen.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this game is really good you get use to it after you have played it a few times. I gotten much better at this
B006P3HXZG|5.0|Truly this is the BEST 3D home movie ever. The 3D effects are worth the price of this movie. We have been disappointed in all of our other 3D home movies because the effects were ho-hum. Even the trailer for Madagascar 3's effects are awesome. They jump out at you and even makes \\"The Egg\\" tolerable, whom we detested in the movie theatre. I highly recommend everyone with a 3D TV to buy this wonderful 3D Movie. I have loved Puss In Boots in all of the Shrek movies and he is great in this one. The 3 Diablo's short is worth it too. Do yourself a favor and buy this one.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Does not even open on HTC Thunderbolt luckily I got it as the free app. But it does look like a cool oldschool arcade game.
B006ON41FC|2.0|so whats the deal can't play the game until you rate it, kind of lame. but thats just my thought
B004EPYZOO|3.0|i like all of nicks movies.i dont care what critics say ,hes great id like to meet him!!!!!  yea right!!!!!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|force close on gnex running aokp.  I would like to play the game.  wish it worked.  waiting for update and may try again.  please fix for all the phones on Verizon.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|When I built my new computer I used a similar product, purchased locally. Big mistake!. I ended up having to remove the heat sink and the low quality thermal compound I originally used due to bad performance.<br /><br />If you don't build computers all the time, as I don't, you will want to include Arctic Clean 1 & 2 for cleaning up and removing old thermal compound.<br /><br />I thought I had done my homework when I researched the components that went into my new system. I neglected to consider this most important element. You NEED a quality thermal paste and the accompanying remover and purifier to complete your well built system. I learned the hard way. This is a superior product.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game was a real headach to play. Just go fedup with it trying to play. The help stage also did not give me enough informartion on how to play this dom game.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|the failing to upload combined with the tweet noises make this app annoying. if they fix that I'll keep it otherwise I'm uninstalling!  chirp chirp chirp
0817439390|5.0|Very well written and very interesting and informative book.  This book teaches you the things you need to know about exposure on your digital camera.<br />If you are brand new to digital photography this book is for you!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I like turtles certain fungi and lots of water the splash around in and have fun with my turtle pals. if you are interested in turtle love give me a ring a ding. I will be playing the best game ever radiant hd. later dudes and dudettes
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Developer updated two days after being released on Amazon app store. Works perfectly, even with incoming text message popups. Much better!<br />I am thoroughly enjoying the throwback feel to the game.
0765350386|5.0|Great books with a creative magic system.  Great series ending, and the sequel/ spin-off book is really fun.<br /><br />One of my favorite series.  I started reading Sanderson because of his work on finishing the Wheel of Time.  Definitely a favorite.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Lots of fun trying to figure out where to put what. Hours of mindless fun and great when killing time. Works great on kindle fire.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|Before I took the plunge and bought the 7D, I had the XSi and really liked it. I bought the opteka grip for it as well and was very happy with the style and feel of the grip. However, it was plastic in design and lacked some of the build quality I wanted. That is where the BG-E7 comes into play and shines quite brightly in comparison. But just picking up the grip for the first time I was amazed by how sturdy it felt im my hands. The buttons are nice as well. I read some of the other reviews and some of them state that the buttons (esp. the shutter button) had a more sensitive touch to it. I personal do not think so. I may have received a better copy so I really can't say. They both seem equal to me. I did notice one thing though. When you hold the grip in portrait style, the grip feels very bulky! Very very bulky. However, with the batteries being the way they are in the camera, I really don't see how Canon could have designed it better so I couldn't take too many stars off my review. All in all I think that the grip provides the \\"pro\\" style to the camera and apart from the slightly bulky style, adds a positive touch and feel to the already fantastic 7D.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|Good acting, good car chases, good soundtrack, and solid plot.  This movie had good action sequences without being over the top (no scenes where he kills 20 differnt hitmen, or a 20 min car chase where 50 police cars are wrecked etc).  There was something a bit different about this movie. To me it had an 80's esque LA feel to it (which I appreciate). Gosling is a simple charater and he doesn't say much or express a lot of emotion.  The best thing about this movie is that the action sequences are not punctuated with thumping techo music, thank God for that!
B002N1AEMS|5.0|Irrespective of one's taste in music, this album (the vinyl edition, in particular) is one of the best produced albums in years. If you are a serious fan of top-quality audio, I heartily recommend you check out this record.<br /><br />While the CD version sounds good, this album really shines when it comes to the sonic quality of the LP. Vocals are crisp, clean, colored beautifully, drum sounds range from paint-peeling booms to subtle splashes, the synth and guitar lines are full of excellent timbral choices and are balanced in the mix with care.<br /><br />If you have nice audio equipment, this LP will reward your ears.<br /><br />Additionally, the song-writing is clever and inspired. The performances are well executed and the album has a pleasant variety of styles.<br /><br />Highest recommendation here! Enjoy!
B006ON41FC|5.0|I usually prefer more cerebral games, and I enjoy this game immensely! Graphics and levels are fantastical. Entertaining for everyone :-)
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|I usually don't like to say anything bad about an app unless I really have to. this app says its optimize for a lot of phones including mine but I download it 4 different times and kept crashing my phone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|it's. great for passing the time, I play in bed, in a waiting room, at my kids sports events anywhere I need to pass the time
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Every low review of this album has one and really only one complaint, Auto-tune. Some make it out like the entire album uses this, but in reality it is used pretty sparingly throughout the album. If you can appreciate a really good album you will like this.  If you are someone who is to much of a music snob to get past auto-tune, well your loss.
6304639457|5.0|Excellent video and service.The VHS tape was free of defects and it arrived on time. The concert by Fleetwood Mac was great. The addition of the USC Trojans Marching Band made Tusk all th more enjoyable
B00417HV14|5.0|When you are listening to \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" on that electrified acoustic, realize that you are witnessing the top of the guitar playing food chain. Best solo performance in many, many years.
B006ZEDZNY|2.0|I haven't read the book so I approached this movie without any knowledge of what to expect. The Rum Diary is an improbable story of a bunch of alcoholic journalists in Puerto Rico who do a range of different things revolving around alcohol but not much to develop any sort of traditional plot. Johnny Depp overacts his way through the piece almost like Jack Sparrow without make-up and very rapidly becomes the least interesting character in the film.<br /><br />While I'm sure the original material is an highly entertaining collection of anecdotes, it simply doesn't add up to a film (or at least not this one). We kept pushing through 20 minutes at a time but by the two-third mark it was clear that nothing was going to happen. Fans of HST may enjoy this but coming in fresh makes it hard to connect with any of the characters or really appreciate or understand the material.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game is always fun to unlock new levels it is very very highly suggested.you should really get this game.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Force close on my Droid X2. Tried again after a reboot, same results<br />Running Android 2.3.4<br />Nothing else to say, maybe they will fix it.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|This Movie is awesome I love seeing the chipmunks one of my favorite films of all time. They should keep making them I will see all of them.  I'm proud to say I'm 24 years old and I will go to a chipmunk film any day.  I get really offended when I see that this is for small children.  What about the people who grew up with them huh.  Tough guy's I see that's what it is.  They don't want to loose their dignity or is it shameful to like a children's film.  Well who ever said it was a children's film.  It's all those rated R films that gets you all \\"eww\\" I don't like this.  Well I'm the kind of person that it don't matter what anyone says to me.<br /><br />I love these kind of films.  I love animated and voice over characters.  Above all my favorite chipmunk is Simon.  So cute.  then it goes Alvin.  You people that do the voice overs are awesome for continuing to do so.  Matthew Grey Gubbler, Jesse McCartney, Justin Long, Amy Poehler, Anna Faris, and Christina Applegate.  You guys also with the chipmunk voices are amazing singers.  I love the harmonizing parts and the solos.  It's incredible.  Rather your good singers or not the finish product is \\"Flawless\\".  By the way this is the first review I have ever written and I'm proud to do it for the Chipmunks.  I will watch this film over and over.  So funny, great singing, great songs, great acting, great story line, and way to keep of their unique personalities.  Alvin the awesome one, Simon the Smart one, Theodore the adorable one, Britney the Pretty one, Janette the not so sure one, Ellenore the clumsy one.<br /><br />Keep up the great work and bring me more songs on discs I collect them all and Listen to them all the time.  I also have all the films.  They get better and better.  Thanks for the Chipmunk fun.  Great fan.  Thomas Searle  (A future actor) working on it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|Nice game and fun for all ages.. Bought a anti owl helmet but cant use it. Says that its equipped. but its not on his head. Any suggestion?
B005V20JKI|2.0|I used to LOVE this game! Ran the update and lost all my data. 68 Levels!!! if you already have this game, DO NOT UPDATE.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Great product for tablets.  Even lets you work with your Google Docs much better than the mobile web interface on Google.
B005ZUR724|3.0|had to uninstall game because of update problem (would not complete) and I tried to reinstall but it would not complete the install. so what do I do now.
B0063IH60K|4.0|operationally sound, with good settings options. an enjoyable app for killing some time with traditional solitaire but nothing fancy. .
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is kind of fun but there are some games in it that aren't that fun and there is much point grinding to get new games.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|App will not open. Automatically goes into 'force close'. Disappointed, looked like an app I would have enjoyed. Am using LG G2x.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I like the game.. It is very entertaining and addicting for me. I have no problems with it. I don't think I will get bored of this game
0786955570|5.0|I purchased this game after reading and watching several reviews online. Neither my wife nor I has ever played a table-top RPG game, though I am somewhat familiar with the world of D&D from a handful of the novels that I've read, the toys I had as a kid and the 80s cartoon. That was about the extent of my D&D experience and my wife didn't even have that much.<br /><br />To make it short, we love the game! We played it nearly every night for about a month and our lack of experience with D&D gaming was not an issue at all. We loved it so much I bought the sequel game Wrath of Ashardalon and we started playing it last night.<br /><br />It's a brutal game and we lose a lot, but that's what makes the victories worthwhile. The rulebook is kept fairly simple, which is good for the casual gamer. It might frustrate people who want to have every possibility covered in the rulebook, but we found that this lack of specificity encourages people to come up with their own \\"House Rules\\" that cover some of those special circumstances that aren't covered in the rules. We enjoy the creativity that this allows the players to use while playing. In addition, the game is different every time you play it, making the replayability a huge plus. It also allows you to create your own adventures/scenarios.<br /><br />On a final note, all the game pieces, cards, etc are excellent. They are very sturdy and durable, much more so than the average board game.<br /><br />If you like cooperative games in a fantasy setting, give this game a chance.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun but repetitive. some of the games are tough to grasp. and the scoring system is a bit broken. overall though its entertaining.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|hate leaving bad reviews but since the app force closes every time I try to open it on my HTC Rezound I have nothing positive to say.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this game is so cool. the graphics are amazing. I think that this is one of the best games I have on my kindle fire.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|i had to get this for the free app... but it won't open... force closes everytime... i still love the game but I'd like the HD version for my droid rAzr maxx and my xoom... maybe an issue with Motorola devices?
B002F6FQGK|4.0|I recently acquired a copy of this album from a friend. I was surprised how many songs I was familiar with on this album.  Listening to it as a whole was a wonderful experience. The vocals are powerful and the instrumental is banging.  Florence + the Machine reminded me of a cross between Regina Spektor and Kate Nash with a unique twist of awesomeness.  I highly recommend this album. The first 3 or 4 songs alone make it worth it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Worth every penny. If it won't download on your tablet. Just go thru the website. Pop Cap does a great job making quirky pickup and play games.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is a classic android game and will work on your device especially if you aren't a ludite like half of android users seem to be these days.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I'm not going to give this app a bad rating, as I can't actually play it. It force-closes on start up. I'm not going to rate it bad or good until I can actually play it. It will stay neutral for now.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My six-year-old daughter, eight-year-old son, and myself love this app.  Quell is not only mentally challenging, but is also relaxing while addictive!  BlockIt is similar, but less rewarding.  This app is A MUST HAVE!
B005NA3B8U|5.0|I was extremely happy to get this game, especially on sale for $0.99.  It is a faithful port of the original game, just as hard as ever.  I love playing it when I have time to concentrate on a phone game.  It is probably a little more challenging than the original, due to two factors.  The first is that your fingers get in the way of the screen.  The second is, you are playing on a much smaller screen than is normal for this game.  It is still extremely fun.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|i liked the game until i got to the hard games on it otherwise it is s pretty good game
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I love to read the works of Charles Dickens. His earthy descriptions, involved plots, and character depictions enthrall me. Therefore, over the years I have owned several sets of his works, both in hardcover and ebook formats, prior to encountering this one. This Delphi edition is a five star quality product, nicely formatted and complete, but the amount of supplemental material ABOUT Dickens (in addition to the actual works BY Dickens) sure eats up a lot of Kindle memory.<br /><br />I am a fan of the Delphi Classics series and I own quite a few of them, but therein lies my dilemma. I like to keep my various complete and collected works sets of significant authors ON my Kindle (rather than archived in the cloud) so that I have immediate and instant access to their content; this enables me to easily and quickly browse, sample, read and re-read the works of notable authors and also refer to highighted, favorite passages within them and notations I have made about them. But I have reached a point where the memory on my Kindle is approaching its limit. Humongous sets (like this) that provide virtually EVERYTHING an author has ever written (the great and re-readable as well as the less-than-good and not particularly worthwhile) and much supplemental material (sometimes of dubious value), have become less appealing to me. Nevertheless, this Delphi edition DOES offer quality (as well as sheer quantity), and apart from the issue of Kindle memory utilization, it is undoubtedly the finest and most comprehensive Dickens collection available at the present time.ioned above, it just wasn't the Dickens set for me.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have this game on my iPod touch. Such a great game! O also have city story on my iPod touch! Wish u guys could great that game for my kindle fire! :)
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Just love it. Reminds me of the hours spent in the arcades in the 80s. Works well on my Fire once I get my fingers to work right &amp; the top of my screen isn't cut off. Graphics are good, I see a lot of hours being wasted.
B000002NIW|5.0|I had this cd but unfortunately it got scratched (on my favorite song non the less) so I was extremely happy to find it, brand new, at a cheap price online :)  I have purchased from this seller before and they have yet to dissappoint me.  Fast shipment and excellent condition (in the condition they described it as).  I'm very happy and will look for them in my future purchases!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Wow, this is so fun! what's with all the low ratings? This is one of the best game apps I've had! Thanks!
B00004Z400|5.0|I am a returning customer and for obvious reasons-fast shipment, excellent description of product and excellent customer service!  I had this cd already but it was scratched so I was thrilled to find it for an amazingly cheap price and in brand new condition!  I am incredibly happy with the seller and the product!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it's a good game, especially for one of the free apps on the market. If you need something to do on a long car ride, this is your game.
B005AUWXZ0|2.0|I really didnt' like this movie.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on exactly what I didn't like about it, whether it was the silly plot, or the heavy handed message, but it just didn't do it for me.  I liked Tangled much better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has been very helpful. The verse lookup is very easy to navigate.  Also being able to narrow search options is extremely useful.  Love bring able to read in different versions.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love all the translations! Great on the go and very User friendly. You can move through with ease. I also appreciate  all the reading plans and options.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this game is good but some of the games are hard to win I think the cost to buy one of the.games Cuz its a lot of points to play a new game
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy the game and the different options it offers. The adds can be annoying but it is ok since the app was free.
B006H8BIIM|4.0|This is a great game but hard the aliens have unlimited resources its a little unbalanced in the aliens favor maybe update will even it out and add upgradable station guns
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Game force closes when attempting to start it on my DROID Incredible. Please fix it! This game looks like fun!
B002ZG99QS|3.0|I remember a few things about the original 1982 film: the light cycles, the throwing glowing Frisbees, the giant flying staplers, the Master Control Program, and the outfits.  That's it.  I thought Tron was the name of the entire universe (it's not).  Basically, I remembered Tron for its technology, not its plot.<br /><br />Which perhaps explains why I was confused watching Tron: Legacy. Is Tron (the computer program) going to be in this movie? What's Space Paranoids?  And why is a CGI-simulation of Jeff Bridge's head talking to his son? MASTER SPOILER: The answers in order are sort of, still don't know, and hopefully you didn't notice that CGI head because you're going to see a lot of it.<br /><br />ENCOM, the game company from the first film, is an Apple-like proxy in the second; its board has lost its way, arrogantly above all reproach and releasing the same operating system with few improvements (it's up to OS-12).  They refuse to release the OS for free, a reminder of the old LINUX debate.  Early in the movie it seems like Tron: Legacy might have a lot to say about the state of technology.<br /><br />But then Sam Flynn (Garrett Hedlund) gets sucked into the program and everyone is poorly lit. The light cycles are back, the giant flying staplers are back, the Frisbees are back, but Master Control is oddly nowhere to be found.  We have a new villain in CLU, who features the same Jeff Bridges digitized head that we saw in the flashback.  Tron: Legacy features flashbacks both to reality and within the mainframe, which makes for a series of jarring transitions.  I half-expected the flashbacks to look like pixilated Atari 2600-style graphics.<br /><br />What we get is Bridges as a digital version of the Dude from The Big Lebowski and wide-eyed hottie Quorra (Olivia Wilde) lounging in various cyber-chic poses. The plot -- oh right, this is a film with a plot! - is that our real-life Users must make it back to the portal to the outside world before CLU uses it to transport his digital army back through it.<br /><br />Tron's entire premise pivots on your ability to buy into this universe.  There's a new race of programs called the ISOs who \\"spontaneously evolved\\" and were subsequently killed off.  CLU is processing other rogue programs to be Stormtrooper-like followers, but it's never made clear what defines a \\"rogue\\" program.  Programs hang out at bars, eat food, paw at each other (porn?) and there are even homeless drunk programs (Internet?).<br /><br />CLU's plan isn't really explained...will his followers have any weapons when they show up in the real world?  It looks like he plans to invade Earth with a few thousand troops.  Dangerous, sure, but enough to take over the world?  Not even close.  The original Tron movie confined its ambitions to technology we could understand: blackmail, video games, and broadcasts of secret code.  Tron: Legacy blows all that in the first five minutes and instead turns into space invaders.<br /><br />As a laser light effects show, Tron: Legacy is amazing, but two hours is simply too much.  As a coherent movie, it's largely the Marix with more glowy parts: There's the dangerous chick in leather who guards our clueless hero, the villain who wants to create rigid conformity, the battle to escape one world to enter the next, and a lot of spiritual mumbo-jumbo about the nature of the soul and its role in the universe.<br /><br />Bridges spouts most of that pseudo-philosophy here, and it's hard not to giggle when he says, \\"you're messing with my Zen thing, man.\\" At just over two hours this superficial film will mess with your Zen thing too.port his digital army back through it.<br /><br />Tron's entire premise pivots on your ability to buy into this universe.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Quick games, easy to play. Good to pick up and play when you dont have a lot of time.  To many ads, but not bad.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Easy to play with the tap-move feature! Great game that will keep you captivated for hours if you let it!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. it's a simple note taking app and I didn't think I would us it much, but I do. I have a kindle fire and I use this app in college to take notes in class all the time. It has the use of bullet points and you can even attatch a picture or draw a picture yourself to attatch to it. You can have a title for notes and it saves the date and time for it automatically. It's a very organized app. I recommend it to anyone.
B0064NTZJO|2.0|Rented Drive as an instant video. Glad I did. Some nice artistic shots, a few decent car action scenes, and a pumping soundtrack. For me, this film can't make up its mind what it wants to be. Part Gone in 60 Seconds, Part Good Fellas, part love story. It falls short on all counts. The ending left me saying- What?. Rent it first and decide for yourself.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Not much to add that hasn't already been said but take it on faith, this is probobly the best serial gangster drama ever made. Episode 2 of the series is enough to want to have the whole box set. In fact, I want it just to see the scene where Dunn Pernsley makes his ignominious appearance. Anyone who's seen it would know what I'm talking about. Lets hope he gets more screen time in season 3.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This apply works VERY well on my kindle fire. It is a very nice app. Useful and dependable! I use this app everyday and suggest you do to!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I rarely play games but my brother recommended this one and it's super entertaining. Would recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|Can't say that the game is good or bad it keeps force closing my Samsung Nexus S 4G on start up.<br />But in the description it says it should work on it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|For a free game, this one delivers a ton of addictive mini-games... the whole time I was playing I kept saying to myself just one more time...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A clasic book that my kids and I love. It is filled with romance, a little bit of mystery, and lots of action for my whole family to read
0451457994|5.0|I'll start by saying I have yet to see this film. I was looking for an imaginative sci-fi novel, and I got one. The book is a generally easy read, the story enthralling and surprising. It's told in a way that seems entirely plausible, with characters that seem like realistic, ordinary humans in extraordinary situations. I was fascinated with space and astronomy as a kid, and this book brought back that feeling of wonder and awe that I haven't felt in a long time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|pretty fun and easy games.  not too stressfull like some games. good variety of games to play seems like the list goes on forever
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a great game if you are bored. I have no complaints of this game it is a great game
B004I744AS|4.0|would like to sort<br />be able to sort the page based on my priorities. and likes and even by size
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|loved this app forever ,never taking it off my kindle fire,I love it, my cousin cade loves it more than i do.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Quest mode is a lot of fun! One minor bug though: There is a keyboard button that appears to bring up an on-screen keyboard for typing in a player name, but it does nothing. Without a hard-key keyboard, your name is just 'Player.'
1439196834|5.0|i found the book to be hilarious, unique and worth reading. if you like the comedy show 'how i met your mother' you will certainly enjoy this book.
B006C1DH92|5.0|even though my big sister is 18 she loves it and I do too.<br /><br />I think you should get it.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|I've read loads of books in my time but never one quite like this. What an amazing imagination Ms Morgenstern has and a great way with words. You're never quite sure what's real & what's not which makes the story even more enchanting.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who thinks outside the square.  And it makes you want to run away and join the circus yourself! One of my all-time favourites!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a good game, but not the best. The consept is good but the mini games are not the best.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|so awesomely addictive i looooooooooooovvvvvvvvve it i timed how long i played it lasted 2 hours that's a really long time
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very interesting game. I love to play mahjong! Its always fun when there is a story line to go along with the game.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I was excited to receive my epic. When I finally got it in the mail, I opened it to find it defective.. but not broken-defective.. It had TWO marbles in it instead of one, which normally wouldn't seem like a big deal. When I started playing with it, I could only use one ball at a time. the other sat in the bottom rolling back and forth as I navigated the puzzle. The sound of the extra ball in the bottom was not only annoying, but noisy and fairly loud-- Enough to break your concentration from the puzzle. Once I had enough of that, I decided to pry open the ball far enough to remove one of the balls. I had to super-glue the blue ring back together, but I did a nice job and it looks fine. This is a very fun puzzle to have. One thing that I think should be mentioned: The clear plastic sphere around the maze is very thin. It is thin enough to be able to be compared to the thickness of the plastic used for disposable plastic bottles. It also scuffs and scratches VERY easily. But as long as you are careful, it should be fine. I think this is a GREAT toy for anyone who is into games or puzzles related to this one. It is very addicting and hard to put down.. Even though I was a bit disappointed about the quality of the toy (considering the fragile sphere and the extra marble), but it is very fun to play once it was fixed and I love it! I hope this review was helpful! :D<br /><br />~NPEAK
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm a Mahjong nut. I've played many variations of the game. This one is superb. Great graphics, lovely tiles, chive of backgrounds. Highly recommend, and works perfectly on my tablet.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I've played about 15 of the games so far. The variety is good. Some I can see playing over and over just for the fun of it. I like the point system. It adds depth to what would otherwise be just a bunch of minigames. Can't beat the price either.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever played!!! The graphics are great and all the weapons are radical! If you like space games and the old nintendo get this app. ITS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1878424319|3.0|Like the title of my review said, it is a good , quick read,finished it in one evening,for those who never considered or read anything about personal freedom, how to be at peace with yourself, etc.<br />I have to agree with the reviews where others wrapped this whole book up in four very simple categoryes, which unless you are totally have lived your life selfishly , I did not take anything away from this book.<br />I even felt as all the knowledge was gathered from other books, etc, and put in a very small simple style.<br />The book was recommended to me by a friends psychologist? So i expected a lot more besides very simple, plain basics of know how of day to day interactions.<br />STill gave it 3 stars for someone totally new to the subject of being in touch with yourself, finding inner peace and being true to your word and understanding the ego and holy spirit.<br />If you want to get a much more meaningful and deeper understanding I would recommend Return to love (from a Course in Miracles) by Marianne Williamson.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is really good. It's actually rated R but it should really be like PG13 because nothing really happens other than a person contemplating suicide. But it's a really, really good movie and i highly recommend it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|For such a simple space shooter (you don't even have a trigger, just left and right buttons) this game has a surprising amount of depth to it.  The cheesy story is a fun respite between sections of gameplay and the power-ups that you can get from fallen enemies can also be procured from shops, allowing you to concentrate on upgrading the weapons you use most.  even the graphics are pleasantly tight and colorful.  It's an awesome nostalgia trip and a worthwhile time waster.  My only caveat would be that, at $1.99<br />, this might be something only fans of the genre can see themselves splurging on.
B006J420UE|4.0|It's an awesome processor!  I use it with both Slackware64 Linux and Windows 7/64.  It compiles programs quickly, boots up fast,and works better than any processor I've had.  The graphics though, I thought would be better.  I installed Dirt, a game that is 6 or 7 years old now, and I can't play it on max settings even at 1280x1024.  Lower it down to 80% on the settings and 1024x768 and it has no problems at all.  I use 8GB of 1333 DDR3 ram, 512MB dedicated to video(the max I can use) and maybe if I had faster RAM it would be faster, but it shouldn't bog down so much.  At least I don't think so.  At least I can add another 6xxx card to go hybrid crossfire or just get a 6970 or high end 7xxx series card and it won't be an issue anymore.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Love it! I would have given it 10 *! love the music and how simple it is to play and level and still be enjoyable.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|If this book was \\"real life\\" I would have been appaled. ....but it' not. It's a great fictional story that takes you on an emotion ride. Read it and enjoy it for what it is! Oh, and the main character Travis is HOT.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is an unbeatable deal on a very sturdy pack.  You kind of expect poor construction and a bag that will last a year or so in this price range.  The build quality of this bag is every bit as good as the Canon brand bag that you can find here and at Best Buy for a significantly higher price.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|A great movie for the whole family to watch. Lots of drama and action that keeps you on the edge of the seat.
B004LUNZ6Q|5.0|I compare these two recordings for several main reasons: they usually head the field in recommendations for the best version to buy; they were the first two I heard, almost simultaneously, when as an teenager I was first becoming enraptured by opera; lastly, I happen to own and play both and listen to them with pretty much equal enjoyment. Neither is perfect but they certainly do justice to this wonderful period-piece which made the sadly short-lived Weber famous throughout Europe.<br /><br />I first heard the Wolf's Glen scene in an EMI sampler LP of operatic highlights and still feel that it is the most atmospheric ever recorded - better than the Kleiber version which, although still effective, doesn't quite capture the Gothic chill and has a rather ordinary-voiced Samiel compared with the hard, abrasive Fritz Hoppe for Keilberth. Where Kleiber particularly scores is in the crowd scenes with the dances and choruses. It was a on a remainder bin LP - only the first LP of the set - that I heard his overture and the opening scene with its natural-sounding crowd noises, mocking laughter and galumphing peasants struck me as enormously invigorating music-making; Kleiber takes the whole thing at a clip and really injects life into proceedings. Keilberth is steadier and more staid, with the grander-sounding BPO but his is also an affectionate and beautifully played account.<br /><br />I give Kleiber five stars even though I readily admit an antipathy to Peter Schreier's throaty, nasal tenor. I really cannot comprehend how some find his pinched voice beautiful but he is impassioned and characterful here, sounding really desperate as Max, so I let it pass. Schock has a more conventionally baritonal heroic tenor and sings agreeably if a tad blandly. Dramatic verisimilitude is enhanced by the fact that Keilberth's singers deliver their own dialogue whereas for Kleiber a very truncated script is employed and actors are used, with the usual mismatch between singing and speaking voices. That abridgement also means that some famous lines are cut, such as that quoted by Bismarck in the Reichstag in 1849: \\"Glaubst du, dieser Adler sei dir geschenkt?\\" (\\"Do you think you get this eagle for nothing?\\").<br /><br />Regarding the leading ladies in both versions, all are superb. There is little to choose between two of the loveliest German post-war sopranos in Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer and Gundula Janowitz, both of whom were lyric sopranos who could sing the lighter Wagner roles and to whose silvery voices I could listen all night. Both Lisa Otto and Edith Mathis are delightful as &Auml;nnchen. I prefer Karl Christian Kohn's mostly focused, black-voiced Kaspar for Keilberth to Theo Adam (sometimes unkindly known by his non-admirers as \\"Mr Wobble\\", but passable for Kleiber). Both hermits are impressive, even if a younger-voiced Franz Crass is steadier than the veteran Gottlob Frick - but both bring the requisite kindly gravitas to the role. The Leipzig chorus is livelier and interpretatively freer than the more \\"operatic\\" Berliners; the latter are less animated in their hailing of Kilian and barracking of Max but only comparatively speaking and they respond credibly in little incidents such as when Max draws a knife on Kilian. Both conductors relish the Bauer element in the music. There are a few clumsy tape edits on the EMI recording and its 1958 stereo sound, although fine, is less immediate than the fuller but slightly toppy DG recording from 1973. (I do not know if the remastering of the latest EMI issue has corrected those edits - can they, in fact?)<br /><br />DG persists in gracing the Originals cover with what is a basic solecism: a double-barrelled shotgun rather than a marksman's rifle. I cannot choose between these two admirable versions but can endorse both as excellent, faithful renditions which do honour to a seminal German opera.voices.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I enjoy<br />both the classic and the quest. Great challenge and good pasttime. Like the choice I<br />of different tile design too.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Awesome to see as FAOTD!<br /><br />A as a fan of old school shooters i purchased this a few years back for my Palm Pre, and I was not disappointed. The graphics are a cool retro style and controls are spot on.<br /><br />Purchased it again after making the jump to Android, and have it on my phone and Kindle Fire. works flawlessly on both.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|The best sleep app I've run across. The sounds are truly random, well recorded, and impossible to tell where the \\"loops\\" begin and end. I constructed a night scene with various cricket tracks that sounds just like the real thing.<br />The crickets come in and out naturally just as if you were on the back porch of a cabin in the woods at night.<br /><br />Fantastic. It would be nice to be able to save your setups though.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|Better than the original! Movie is freaking hilarious, you'll laugh from beginning to end, but be aware, some content is NOT for kids under 18 or even 21, lol! Get it and enjoy!
0385474547|4.0|The themes in \\"Things Fall Apart\\" were powerful, especially the deterioration of a traditional society once outsiders brought their own values into the culture. Well-meaning foreigners brought their own religions and Western customs into a traditional African culture they viewed as backwards or savage, and in need of redemption and modernization. I never understood the deeper meaning of colonialism before I read this book. I was also left with a deeper understanding of indigenous cultures and a realization that people who lived in traditional societies didn't have anything broken that needed to be fixed by the colonialists.<br /><br />The characters aren't particularly likable, but I don't believe the author intended to write a book with admirable or lovable characters. Truly, some parts of the book were excruciatingly dull, but the importance of \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is the history behind it, even though the book is a work of fiction. If the book is required reading for a literature course, I highly recommend purchasing a study guide to accompany the text. This is a book that needs a roadmap if you're going to spend a serious amount of time analyzing it for a research or term paper.
B005HSL626|5.0|hi dad I know you are reading this and I rate you and this game 5 stars cuz I like to slice fruit and you rock!
0307593312|2.0|A gigantic fantasy with a miniature conclusion; a lion head-start with a mouse-tail ending. Yet it takes 944 pages of, at time magnificent, but more often than not fumbling and endless rambling, to complete the tale.<br /><br />Aomame, a socially conscientious professional female assassin has reached a mating season. In a moment of desperation and valor she steps out of the real world, 1984, entering an unreal, imaginative world of 1Q84. The most conspicuous difference between the two worlds is, in the the latter the sky hangs two moons, one yellowish, like the real world's, and one smaller misshapen green moon. This is the best of the whole book but it is excessively repeated hundreds of time in the book to remind readers of the strangeness of the 1Q84. In 1Q84 the child love fantasy and awful memory of mistreatment by the parents, the failing to understand social changes and chaos of the time, and her rebellion against all these experiences and mental tortures are infinitely amplified and developed into a complex and kaleidoscope of events and plots.<br /><br />Murakami has created many interesting characters; Aomame, Tengo, Ushikawa, Fuka-Eri, Komatsu, Dowager, Tamaru, etc, and at the book end most of these protagonists simply evaporate without any word about their fate and destiny. Air Christalis is Maza's (Mother) womb in which dohta (daughter) is conceived and nourished. That is clear from the start. But, why immaculate pregnancy for Aomame? I am completely puzzled.<br /><br />All in all, Murakami is a great author too ambitious to create a magnum opus of philosophical and religious discussion about the future and the way of humanity. He could have trusted his readers to be able to understand the text without repeating many statements hundreds of time. Three or four handred pages of tedious text may be cut off from the gigantic volume, without sacrificing the clarity of the book. I have one thing to confess, however. Despite of the text's tediousness the bookis a page-turner for me. I couldn't put it down.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|After receiving this and trying to play it in my Sony BD player, BDP-BX1, it would not get past the opening splash screen. Tried it on the other BD player, same model, same thing.<br /><br />Come to find out, this is a 50hz disc instead of the normal 60 and does not work on Sony BD players. Email back from 2E/BBC, their suggestion was to buy a new BD player.<br /><br />Gee, thanks!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I am so addicted.  Love that this game has tons of levels. Very challenging. My kids always want to play it too.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|love this app! The ability to progressively increase the difficulty level is great. On my way to becoming a better player
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|this isn't too bad for a galaga spinoff. it sorta has a &quot;all your base are belong to us&quot; feel. the dialogue in between rounds is simultaneously tedious and amusing. great for a faotd.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|App will not open on HTC Evo.  Force closes every time I try to open it.  Can't say if I like it or not if it won't even run.  Uninstalling it.  May try it again another day.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Though this movie wasn't a huge blockbuster it was a well acted and intersting movie. I really enjoyed watching it and found John Travolts made a great bad guy. It also has many twist and turns that you don't see coming right up to the end with one final twist. This movie also stars halle Berry and hugh Jackman both of who were amazing in it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys a great action film and who is a fan of anyone of these amazing actors/actress
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Excellent game. Big fun. Worked perfectly on my Motor Droid X. Works perfectly on my Samsung Galaxy S2. Top 5 Android game out.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|I went on a ghostbusters craze a little while ago, and I had the movies on VHS, but those are basically obsolete nowadays, so it was time to upgrade my collection. The case is shiny and very eye-catching and the discs are in a slim pack with the little book. It's very awesome! I love it!

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Amazing album. Best album I have heard in years. A lot of great reviews on here for this so I will keep this short and just get my 5 star review out there. I listened to it for like two weeks straight and will come back to it again after a couple months. Phenomenal job Foo Fighters!

B005K2YZ5E|5.0|I recently picked up a [[ASIN:B0051QVESA Kindle, Wi-Fi, 6\\" E Ink Display - includes Special Offers & Sponsored Screensavers]] and was a little worried about scratching it in a bag or something.  I like the colour scheme of this Timbuk2 sleeve, always a plus.<br />The fabrics are top notch.  If I were to guess, 300D to 400D Oxford or Cordura, it'll take a beating.  Not that you'd want it too, the padding isn't too thick, it's not going to help with like a 3m fall or anything.<br />The stitching is quite good too.  Nothing loose, nothing dangling.<br /><br />If you have a Kindle with special offers, look for a special offer on these, it makes it a great deal!

B004HW7JMO|4.0|This six episode prequel to Spartacus hardly seems forced or unplanned. I don't believe they actually did this just because Andy Whitfeld was unwell, I mean I'm sure he wasn't fit to shoot but the story goes they did this because they wanted to give Andy time to recover. To be honest, I liked this so much. We got to see a side of the king and his queen, the past, it was almost like Karma. Though it had only six episodes, the character build up was interesting and characters who seemed to have died in the first season came \\"ALIVE\\" in this prequel which was both astonishing and marveling at the same time.<br /><br />Spartacus is such a guilty pleasure. It is extremely graphic, occasionally full of adrenaline, sometimes just plain gory and absurd, but for most of it one of the most remarkable shows I've seen on television ever. Every actor makes you believe this is the only realm they have ever existed in, you tend to forget it's not real. This season has a lot of story, plenty of fights and a surprise end which left me baffled. Watch it before the suspense is revealed to you!
B005HJWWW8|3.0|Nice little lightweight device that sits between your audio device and headphones to amplify the sound. It does work well but has a rechargeable battery that only seems to last me about 4-6 hours. I wish it took a regular replaceable battery so when I take it on the road with me, I can swap it out and be back in business.<br /><br />For the price, I expected a better build quality. It's very lightweight plastic and feels pretty cheap. I took off one star for the build quality and one for the very poor battery life.
B005I6EU48|4.0|I bought this very soon after receiving my Kindle Fire. As a book lover, the classic book cover appealed to me. I've used it for four months and like it alot. It works fine, is sturdy, and protective when using. Soft inner cover protects from scratches. I have only a few issues with it. It has no strap or magnet to keep it closed when carrying in my purse. Since I have scratching materials in my purse (keys), I have an improvised solution: a long hairband wrapped around it horizontally (stretchy material to hold it in place). I also use my Fire to read and watch videos while in bed and find the absence of a vertical stand annoying, but I just prop it up with a pillow. Other than those two issues, it's a great purchase. Well worth the money when considering the investment of protection of my Fire.

B004R13U6Y|4.0|This app is fantastic for reading PDFs. It pauses appropriately, and clearly reads and pronounces the words, even complex ones. It does this very well.<br /><br />A few drawbacks: You can only start it at the beginning of the page. A problem if your PDF has tables and lists. Would like to see this fixed in a revision..<br /><br />Another setback is the editing/mark-up features. Each time you want to mark up it wants to create a new mark-up document. You can draw lines and boxes and place notes, but you can't highlight, which is what I want. So I have to use a different app to do the mark-ups. These are minor tweaks that could be extremely useful.<br /><br />However, as a reading app, it's a great tool to own. Well worth the few dollars.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|Its almost nostaglic playing this game. Its like space invaders with a more. its fun. playing it on my HP tablet.

0143116371|5.0|Thank you so much for the speedy delivery!! This gorgeous book came in perfect condition, was even better than I imagined ( such beautiful photography, interesting people, places and FA-shion) BUT the only thing is that the book itself is small and quite thick ( making it a little awkward to read in bed no?) I am seriously thinking of forking out the extra money and buying the coffee table version. It would truly make the most amazing centre piece of any living room and invite mad conversations about fashion and art.
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|Had no problem running it on Droid 3. I imagine most of you need to try updating your phones, or at least just restart them. Anyways, this game is OK, looks like a stylized version of Space Invaders. In fact, the developer is definitely in danger of some copyright issues with some of the sprites being directly copied from that game. Unfortunately firing is also automatic, which adds some difficulty but also makes this not as fun. Meh.

B00003OSU4|5.0|~ Bert Stern only made one movie in his career, and it is visually stunning.  From the start it is clear that Bert Stern is a visual artist with a great understanding of perspective, angle, selective focus, and image composition.  That is what made him such a successful photographer.  He set out to produce a document of a special weekend in Newport, and he succeeded.  He did a great job of incorporating scenes from the America's Cup trials of that weekend along with scenes of the local people going about their wealthy lives plus the unique event of the jazz festival.  He was able to subtly show the co-existence of the ultra-rich at leisure and the musicians at work.  Through images of the crowd he was able to show the fact that at an event such as a jazz festival people of all races and ages could enjoy each others company - in the 1950's in America that was not always the case.<br />~ The bonus features include an extensive interview with Bert Stern that is enlightening.  Not only does he outline his concepts in putting together the documentary but he gives credit where credit is due when he talks about the contribution of the Avakian brothers.  That interview also clearly indicates his intent to make this something other than just a concert film.  In addition to the interview on the DVD, the liner notes accompanying the DVD provide futher insight.<br />~ Others have written about the fact that this is not a \\"concert film\\" in the broadest sense of that phrase, and Stern makes it clear that he did not intend it to be strictly a \\"concert film\\".  For that reason, people looking for a film that documents all or most of the performances from that weekend are rightfully disappointed.  However, the film does give us some wonderful moments and the opportunity to watch performances by artists who we would not otherwise be able to see.  Where else can you see video of Jimmy Giuffre with Bob Brookmeyer or Chico Hamilton's band practicing or Chuck Berry improvising with a clarinetist or the absolutely stunning sight of Mahalia Jackson casting a calming spell over an audience by singing \\"The Lord's Prayer\\". By editing together the images of Miss Jackson and her captivated crowd, Stern is able to demonstrate the power of music.  Of course, this is the movie in which Anita O'Day delivers her marvelous performance that rocketed her to international stardom and brought her to the attention of a broad audience.<br />~ The insert liner notes and the interview also indicate that there are tens of thousands of feet of film archived somewhere waiting to be explored.  Hopefully someday someone will take up the challenge and go through all that film and give us a more complete view of the music from that weekend.  But for now we should be thankful that we have this beautifully captured and excellently edited document of a time when people went to a concert unencumbered by electronic devices, e-mail, text messages, etc and all they did was enjoy the music.inetist or the absolutely stunning sight of Mahalia Jackson casting a calming spell over an audience by singing \\"The Lord's Prayer\\".

B006OFN0BQ|3.0|Let's face it: J. Edgar Hoover is one of the more controversial figures of the 20th Century.  He was the top lawman in the nation, but he often resorted to unsavory tactics to bring down the bad guys (and kept files on a bunch of the \\"good\\" guys whose views he distrusted, such as JFK and Martin Luther King, Jr.).  He was a complex human being: hero and villain at the same time, insecure but powerful, distrusting even of his own emotions.  No one film could ever capture such a figure.<br /><br />J. EDGAR tries.  It really does.  Dustin Lance Black's (MILK) script is solid, if not quite eventful.  Despite such a volatile central figure, the closest thing to a climactic moment comes between Hoover and his rumored lover, Clyde Tolson; that would be great, if this were a film about Hoover's possible homosexuality, but it isn't.  Nor is it a film about Hoover's political subterfuge.  Or the founding of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  It's a film about all of that, which means it ends up, really, being a film about none of it.  It tries encompassing too much, and in the end, it's as though everyone involved unanimously agreed that Hoover was far too complex for that.  So they settled for something a little watered-down.<br /><br />That's not to say this film doesn't have its merits.  It's another solid piece of filmmaking from director Clint Eastwood.  It's not in his \\"great\\" category (say, UNFORGIVEN or MYSTIC RIVER); it's more like INVICTUS, which was undeniably good but otherwise unremarkable.  Likewise, Leonardo DiCaprio gives a layered performance at the titular character; it's not his best, either, but it's worth watching.  The best moments of the film come from the inferiority Hoover feels from interacting with others, namely Judi Dench as his mother, Armie Hammer as Tolson, and Naomi Watts as trustworthy secretary Helen Gandy.  It is in these moments that J. EDGAR shows glimmers of what it could have been.  Unfortunately, each relationship could easily have been its own film, and that's not even brushing the various political angles.  As is, J. EDGAR is a film that tries to do too much--but at least you know you have a solid, dependable crew behind at the helm.een its own film, and that's not even brushing the various political angles.

1416583432|4.0|Psychologist and self-proclaimed dog lover, Alexandra Horowitz turned the research world inside out when she suggested to her PhD adviser a study of the ordinary dog. In academia the baboon was a worthier research subject. Determined Horowitz pursued an eight year study of man`s best friend. Although a plethora of breed and training books are marketed yearly, there is little serious research on our canine companion. This book fills in some of the gaps. The author challenges the reader to view the world from the canine's point of view or umwelt.  The result is an enjoyable and informative read for a general audience.<br />  The book blends anecdotal and scientific material as it meanders to closure. Editing some of the research material on other animals may pick up the pace. Objective points in each chapter are illustrated by linkage to memories of her beloved dog, Pump. Horowitz validates her well documented research by making it personally relevant.<br />  Some of the following points are particularly interesting. Although Horowitz acknowledges a DNA link, less than one percent, between dog and wolf in the distant past(145,000 years ago), she does not subscribe to current view of dogs as pack animals. She devotes a significant part of the book exploring physical, developmental and social differences between the dog and its progenitor the wolf. Her conclusion is no canids are as fully domesticated as the dog.<br />  This year's Westminster show recognized 2,500 breeds.  According to the author, classifications of AKC breeds are genetically inaccurate. Cairin terriers share much of their genomes with hounds, shepherds and mastiffs.<br />  Contrary to popular belief, dogs are not color blind although their vision is somewhat muted. They see objects at a distance better than close-up, but sight is not a dog's primary sense. Humans have six million olfactory receptors. Depending on the breed, dogs can have over three hundred million. Two other misconceptions are clarified. Dogs do not urinate to mark territory but to pass on important information. Posture rather than size determines dominance.<br />  Alexandra Horowitz has written a solid book that demands readers to view the world through the dog's senses. Greater understanding strengthens the bond between man and his best friend.ed. Dogs do not urinate to mark territory but to pass on important information.

0385342063|5.0|Poppy Wyatt has just lost her engagement ring and soon thereafter she also loses her phone. What's a girl to do when her entire life is going down the tubes and her entire life is maintained on her phone?  Life of course becomes completely befuddled as Poppy tries to hide the fact that she has lost the heirloom engagement ring from her fiance.<br /><br />Poppy's life also becomes extremely complex when she loses her phone because after all texting, emails and voicemails are the only way anybody really converses these days.  [[ASIN:0385342063 I've Got Your Number: A Novel]] is a delightful look at how today's singles stay in touch and mingle and really conduct their lives through technology and ubiquitous texting.<br /><br />What starts out as an unfortunate story about losing an engagement ring soon turns into a story about losing a ring and finding something even better.  This is a wonderful, funny, story about love in the texting age! I found myself laughing as I always do at Sophie Kinsella's appealing and endearing heroine, Poppy Wyatt. A must read for all the Sophie Kinsella fans out there.

0062073486|5.0|Having never read a book by Agatha Christie before, I had no idea what to expect. It was such a small book, when compared with the several-hundred-page books I typically read. I didn't know what I was getting into!<br />The story starts off quite slowly, as the author introduces us to a group of ten, previously unacquainted people, who have all been invited or hired to spend the weekend on Indian Island off the coast of Devon. Not one of the ten strangers knows who has invited them, and none of them has ever been to the island before, but for various reasons, they all accept the invitation. When they arrive, everything seems in order except for one thing-- their host is not there. Thus begins the mystery, and it only deepens when they each discover the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme posted on a wall in their bedrooms.<br />One by one, people begin to turn up dead, and with each death, the panic increases among the remaining guests. Which one is the killer? As mystery readers, we try to figure it out before all is revealed at the end. Anyone who actually gets it right in this book, is either lucky or an incredibly good guesser!
B006UG90RM|3.0|Many people, more than expected actually, have dissected The Truth song by song, and Amazon doesn't need another boomer reliving the 'old days' song, by old song, Don't assum that the 2 rating means that I am a Sammy/VH guy (although I do really like the Chickenfoot material), Roth is the natural singer for Eddies flash/bang guitar work.  The problem with the Truth is that while it was written by VH in a Roth Haze Day, it was written for the talents they possessed at that time.  Sure Alex hasn't lost beat, and Wolfgang (Wolfie - what were Eddie and Valerie doing, watching the Munsters while, um, nm), brings some fast, driving bass lines that are beginning to elude Michael in CF, but when it comes down to the front men it's a bit of a different story.  One might think Eddie has re-energized his signature licks and is Eddie Van 1984.  The Truth, is that he is reaching to stay up with songs older than Wolfie.  Actually doing an excellent job of it - for now.  But then there is Enigma Dave.  The mirror and the hour glass have been the least kind to Diamond (now Cubic Zirconium) Dave.  While wishing for bionic Eddie's new parts, he has lost the most.  The speaker splitting highs are now 2 octaves lower, his speedy lyrics written to compliment Eddie flair, now feel edited on the old material.  His voice almost forces him to talk through his lyrics, though nothing new to Dave's style, but it now feels 'required'.  He still has 'style' if a fair amount less hair, but that's The Truth for most of our favorite 'classic' rockers.  Overall, I probably should change this to a 3, for effort and pouring the energy they can into their shows, but this is about The Truth. Which is a studio updated vehicle for Eddie's talents back when he was in to showing them off and hadn't found the synthesizer as a primary tool, (Jump excluded). The band backs him admirably, except for Dave's 'Reader's Digest Singing'. A nice, but already aged, welcome back.  The Real Truth will be the next album, assuming they don't implode before then.  Wolfgand and Alex, will guarantee a top notch rhythm sound.  But the Truth is can they still write Eddie Van Fretboard songs while tailoring the lyrics/melodies to Dave's new vocal range, without sliding to the ballads of recent years.  A Different Kind of Truth is a collection of 80's B cuts with 2112 mixing. The New Truth will be what comes next.  Can they give us an album full of A side, guitar wizardry loaded songs with clever lyrics in Dave's current range while staying in the hot rock and roll genre.  That will be the Truth.  I'd love to see that happen.assuming they don't implode before then.  Wolfgand and Alex, will guarantee a top notch rhythm sound.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I'm sure plenty of you recall lugging one of the Twilight series to the beach with you, don't do that with these books.  Sure it may be labeled young adult, but there is a very good chance you will spontaneously burst into tears regardless of the fact that you are in public (that being said, take my word that this is also NOT a gym read).  When everyone was telling me to read these I immediately assumed they would be like Harry Potter and Twilight because of the YA label.  However, unlike those books there was NO filler in these, I was not skipping sections, pages, chapters.  These books will not be in my friends' beach bags summer after summer once they start reading.  It was also amazing, how quickly you bond with the characters.  I will definitely recommend these books to my friends, of course with the warning about reading in public and NOT for when you are just looking for a light hearted read.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have played a few games on my kindle fire now and this one is one of the best.  Played their &quot;grisley manor&quot; game and &quot;lost city&quot; is.much, much better.  The in game map and hint guide are very helpful (if you are like me you end up searching for walkthrus for most games at some point so with the included hint guide you won't have to).  The puzzles are fun without being frustrating.  Hats off to FMG and I hope they make a lot more like this one, I would certainly buy more like it.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is great!!! Anyone old enough to remember Galaga will see that.<br />Although, my family might not share my enthusiasm since Ive been sitting here for the last 2 hrs playing instead of catering to everyone else. Oh well, Mom is taking the day off to play more Radiant!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is fun. I don't think anything is cut off. If something is cut off it doesn't affect game play. First levels seem pretty easy although I die every time.  A good time waster.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game for my children after seeing it played at a Girl Scout outing. I do advise reading the 2-3 pages of rules thoroughly to understand how the game is played, but my children caught on quickly and love this game.  The rules are straighforward and easy to understand with the overall tallying of points very simple. I like that it focuses on building up cities, settlements, and roads vs. destroying your opponent.  You win by what you have achieved, not what you have destroyed. The game usually last about 1-1.5 hours which is just right for my kids. I highly recommend this game.
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|This is my second on the paleo subject and I it was good, but not nearly as engaging or fun enough to draw you in like The Paleo Solution Diet by Robb Wolf. I'm glad I read Wolf's book first, because if I The Paleo Diet (by Cordain) first, I would not have purchased a second book on the subject.  Cordains book, though informative focused too much on \\"no, no, no\\" and came off much more restrictive (although I bet it is generally the same exact principals).<br /><br />BTW, the robbwolf.com website has great free info to get you shopping and eating paleo out of the shoots.  The Cordain site wanted to sell you back newsletters, etc. which is a real turn-off for someone like me who is nibbling around the edges deciding whether or not to dive in.<br /><br />Good luck!

0449011151|1.0|I couldn't wait to start reading this novel and I was sadly disappointed in the writing. The author did use all the source information correctly, but she kept telling the same tale over and over again. It was very tedious reading in some places, especially the ending when Elizabeth and Darcy rehashed his infamous letter from P&P. There is some expanding of the characters personalities, but all in all the novel read like a book report gone wrong. Save yourself some time and read P&P over, and then imagine their subsequent lives for yourself, it will be more satisfying.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|I decided to rent this movie because it was nominated for best picture.  With Brad Pitt and Sean Penn I thought this will be a quality film even though I had no idea what the movie was about.<br /><br />Was I ever wrong.  The Tree Of Life is torture to watch.  It is dull, boring and runs about an hour too long.  It fails in its attempt to be artsy and spiritual while explaining the meaning of life.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|A great program that now I can modify all my documents without needing to be at my computer they are with me.
B000YABYLA|5.0|It starts as one of those everyday dramas, a teenage girl finds herself pregnant. Her first thought is to end the pregnancy but, when the time comes, she shies and bolts from the clinic for no rational reason. Instead, she decides to bring the baby to term and find a good home for it.<br /><br />Even when she's as big as \\"a planet\\" (and equally inhabited), Juno keeps her sassy attitude and sarcastic humor. Her character, played wonderfully well by Ellen Page, carries the movie with her one-liners and attitude. Like the other characters, Juno comes across as complex and believable, fragile and resilient at the same time. Her social world seems true too, almost a closed society of teenagers with incidental and often uncomfortable interactions with the adults.<br /><br />This might be the most improbable feel-good movie ever. In fact that would be the one criticism I'd offer, that it seems a bit more \\"cleaned up\\" than I'd expect many lives to be. The teenagers are goofy, gawky, and uncertain, but never show the vicious edge that comes out way too frequently. Her whole world is largely supportive, or at least benign. I don't wish a pregnancy on any teenager, but I'd wish that kind of support for any who do end up as mommy-to-be, the kind of support that too few girls in trouble seem to get. That happy background keeps makes the comedy possible, and the edgy humor makes this movie succeed.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B005B19UPE|4.0|I believe Holocaust novels are a double-edged sword in mainstream literature. Certainly they are ripe for good drama and would appeal to masses that way; however, they are certainly not feel-good reads, which may put a damper on sales. With Sarah's Key, however, Tatiana de Rosnay has crafted a beautifully bittersweet story that is part mystery, part tragedy and overall an absorbing and suspenseful read.<br /><br />Julia Jarmond is a journalist living in Paris, readying herself to move into an old apartment that her husband has inherited. When she is assigned to write an article about the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup--a Nazi-decreed raid and mass arrest that took place in Paris in July 1942--she discovers that the apartment was inhabited by her in-laws, the Tezacs, after the previous residents, a Jewish family, were arrested. Her investigation leads her to uncover secrets buried by the Tezac family for generations, and she develops an insatiable fascination with the Jewish family's daughter, Sarah Starzynski, who was just ten at the time of the Roundup and disappeared without a trace, never confirmed dead or alive in concentration camp records.<br /><br />The novel tells Sarah's and Julia's stories simultaneously, cross-cutting between time periods; from the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup to Julia's personal and journalistic endeavors. This method effectively generates suspense for Sarah's storyline, though Julia's takes a while to pick up the pace and become as absorbing as the former. While Julia's story begins with the inspection of her new apartment, Sarah's begins with being woken up on that fateful night in 1942 by the French police; the inciting incident that draws readers in immediately.<br /><br />At times the novel suffers from occasional plot contrivance and drama-provoking gimmicks, which are needless, as the story is fairly strong enough on its own. There are also times when predictability dampens whatever power the plot twists and sudden turns of events carry. When a writer has engaging characters and a methodically conceived plot, there is no need for dramatic stunts and affectations to keep readers turning the page.<br /><br />Sarah's Key is a flawed yet worthwhile read; moving, riveting, and successfully maintaining, for the most part, a balancing act between the suspense of a detective novel and the tragic elements that are to be expected of a Holocaust novel. Readers will want discover along with Julia what became of Sarah Starzynski; whether she became a camp statistic or the heroine of her own inspirational story of survival.<br /><br />You can read this and other reviews at my blog: [...]and a methodically conceived plot, there is no need for dramatic stunts and affectations to keep readers turning the page.

B001BMWH5C|4.0|This 2008 rendering of The Incredible Hulk makes for good summer fun. It has a hero you can like, a girlfriend you can like even more, and bad guys you can feel good about disliking. The hero, of course, is Bruce Banner, a basically nice guy, a scientist, living life on the run. He has plenty to run from and that includes himself - but, for once, he's winning that part of the race. Liv Tyler brings girlfriend Betty to life as a strong, loving character with Tyler's unique kind of good looks. The bad guys include a military nutjob who wants to own Banner and another military nutjob who wants to be Banner.<br /><br />This Hulk had a lot to live down, because of unfortunate previous attempts at bringing the green guy to the screen. It does a fair job, too, largely because of up-to-date effects. This does have its own problems, though, like the ridiculous efforts at military action to capture The Hulk - the same efforts, again and again, no matter how often they fail. Well, maybe that is realistic.<br /><br />This time, Marvel has put its creative efforts into a fair piece of summer movie entertainment. I found it pretty forgettable, except for that sequel-bait at the end, so wait for a hot day, then sit back and enjoy the popcorn, the air conditioning, and the movie.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0061537969|5.0|Chances are this novel's target audience has not read a book from a dog's point of view since the children's classic, The Poky Little Puppy, or Eric Hill's Spot the Dog series. Nonetheless, The Art of Racing in the Rain is beautifully written, moving, funny and surprisingly philosophical, and its appeal is not limited to dog-lovers. Garth Stein has crafted an exquisite story with an endlessly charming narrator, and provides a deeply affecting look into the mind of a dog with a human soul.<br /><br />Enzo, an elder dog awaiting the end of his days, lives in Seattle with his beloved owner, Denny Swift, a mechanic and racecar driver, and relates stories of the Swift family's trials and tribulations over the years. From his adoption as a puppy to Denny's marriage, the birth of his daughter, his wife's illness, the tragedy and hardships that follow, and all the racetrack happenings in between, Enzo narrates with the wisdom of a wordless observer, with humanlike clarity and perception, even while bound by basic canine needs. Believing he will someday be reincarnated as a man, Enzo makes it a priority to observe human behavior and gain knowledge to carry with him to his next life.<br /><br />Stein often uses the racetrack as a metaphorical representation of life itself, as Enzo shares Denny's passion for racecars and often compares the Swift family's dysfunction to the challenges faced while racing under trying circumstances. In addition to the mind of a dog, readers get an inside look into the mind and mentality of a racer and the balance they must achieve between stability and the need for speed.<br /><br />Enzo's personality adds a whimsical quality to the narration. He's part crotchety elder, part adventurous youth; both a sworn protector of his family and a dependent house pet; a dog who prides himself on being well-behaved and civilized, yet possesses animal instincts that sometimes drive him to disobedience. His frustration at being unable to speak to humans is palpable, though he assures himself that he compensates by being a good listener. Added for comic relief is his longing for opposable thumbs.<br /><br />Heartrending yet ultimately uplifting, The Art of Racing in the Rain captivates with its painfully accurate portrait of the joys, tragedies and absurdities of human life, and its meditation on what it means to be human, all shown through the eyes of a winning protagonist. Also by Garth Stein is Racing in the Rain: My Life as a Dog, a children's adaptation of the story, which younger readers will certainly enjoy.<br /><br />You can read this and other reviews at my blog: [...]himself that he compensates by being a good listener.

B005HEW7JG|5.0|U.S.S. Voyager, NCC-74656 departs from Deep Space Nine (where we get a nice cameo from Armin Shimerman - Quark).  The first 25 minutes are worth a 5/5 star rating alone.  It's movie quality.  After that, it starts to slow down.  But plenty are packed into this 90 minute debut of one of the most famouse ships in Starfleet.  Overall, this episode gets 4.8/5 Stars on the Trek-O-Meter. It's also very important to see if you are watching the Voyager series.  I recommend this to any fan of Star Trek and good Science Fiction.<br /><br />Season 1 as a whole is not one of the better Voyager seasons.  There's a lot of character development, but the season story is small compared to what this ship and her crew faces in later seasons.  Worth watching though.  ~Keep On Trekkin'
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|This uncommon animation starts with tween-aged angst, the kind that demands independence but still wants mom and dad close by. Her busy parents don't have much time for her, though, and her new, remote home doesn't offer much reward for her explorations (other than some rather kooky neighbors). So, even if it's not wholly conscious, Coraline wishes for a nicer place and parents that pay more attention.<br /><br />As the movie's tagline says, \\"be careful what you wish for.\\" Like Alice down the rabbit hole, Coraline finds a secret passage to a more magical place. Soon, however, the magic turns dark. That's where the brilliant animation really comes into its own. The stop animation (or at least the look of it) bring to mind Tim Burton with a macabre touch of Brothers Quay. You know your child best - skittish ones might find some of the imagery a bit much. Still, kids' stories (like Alice in Wonderland) have always had dark edges. That deliciously spooky sense, plus some great animation, really set this movie apart from the usual.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
1594744769|5.0|Fans of Harry Potter and X-Men may take to this tale of a school designed specifically for children with magical powers--or \\"peculiars,\\" as they are called--even though this school is a far cry from the caliber of Hogwarts or the Xavier Institute. Written by Ransom Riggs and beautifully illustrated with old sideshow photos, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a delightfully eerie and engaging fantasy that will appeal to both teen and adult readers.<br /><br />The protagonist is Jacob, a teenage outcast struggling to make sense of his grandfather's mysterious death, and the outlandish stories he left behind; stories of his adventures in World War II, and of living in an orphanage for children with supernatural powers. When Jacob travels to a remote Welsh island to investigate these stories, he falls headlong into a fantastical world populated by shape-shifting demons, where he meets Miss Peregrine, the matriarch of a hidden land that houses a mansion designed to protect the children in her care from the outside world. Jacob inadvertently upsets the balance between Miss Peregrine's world and ours, setting off a catastrophic chain of events that make him realize his own supernatural abilities.<br /><br />The discovery of the orphanage introduces a colorful cast of peculiar characters. First we are introduced to Emma, a girl who can conjure fire, and Millard the invisible boy. There's also Olive the levitating girl; Hugh, who has bees living in his stomach; Bronwyn, the girl with super strength; and Horace, who has prophetic dreams; to name a few. Miss Peregrine herself is a fun character in her own right: part formidable matron, part shape-shifting sorceress.<br /><br />Jacob is an amusing narrator; his sarcasm and dry humor make the novel funny and compulsively readable. His disgruntlement with his wealthy, frivolous family is often a point of comic relief, and also lends some depth to his internal struggle of whether to remain with his peculiar friends or return to his lackluster existence in a small town in Florida.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs has earned himself a devoted following with this novel that is sure to expand with the upcoming sequel. Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is equal parts funny, spooky and splendidly bizarre, and an absorbing read from start to finish. Both parents and children will have a fun time with this one.<br /><br />You can read this and other reviews at my blog: [...]existence in a small town in Florida.

B002BWP49C|4.0|... hot, sweet, and thoroughly mixed up.<br /><br />After some family weirdness, Bella arrives a new high school in mid-term. Even when she receives a warm welcome, her mood stays as dark as the grey skies over the Pacific Northwest. Soon, she meets Edward, a Steppenwolf character. He's handsome enough, but a loner and a mystery, the kind that Bella would like to solve. When she's assigned to his lab bench in science class, he nearly bolts like a spooked horse. That just tweaks her interest even more.<br /><br />Then an out-of-control car nearly crushes her. Edward 'pushes her out of the way,' or so she tells people. The truth is far stranger, though, and leads her to solve his mystery. That (plus the fact that he just saved her life) just commits her to him even more. Much to everyone's surprise, including his own, he reciprocates. Although Bella's father worries that he's a little old for her - if he only knew! - only a biologically driven tension really invades their happiness. Oh, and a couple of thoroughly bad badguys.<br /><br />Some nice moments follow, including a \\"meet the family\\" scene with more than usual awkwardness. We see some realistically poor teen judgement, too, the kind so believably motivated by an overheated romantic sense. Giving away much more of the plot would mean giving too much away, but there's some good action, fearful moments that never go too far, and charming humor at the family baseball game.<br /><br />This could have been a mess of a genre-hopping teen romance flick, but the pieces came together nicely. Maybe it won't be one for the ages, but it looks like one of the better date movies in a long time, especially for the teen demographic.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
159420229X|5.0|This has become my new most favorite novel. I couldn't imagine such a piece (before reading) taking on Milan Kundera's 'unbearable lightness of being,' but this is exactly what Joshua Foer did. I am no good at reviewing books, or anything for that matter, I have nothing swanky or eloquent to say about my experience of this book other than it is beautifully modern in genre and if you are thinking about getting it, absolutely get it.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case fits well, the lid doubles as a stand and the lid strap, although not intended to be, can double as a hand strap.  Just two suggestions, make the stand more robust (it tends to fall easily), and have more than one stand angle.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|This recasts F. Scott Fitzgerald's original (which I have not read) somewhat, but the format works. Here, Benjamin's story appears through diaries, postcards, and reminiscences, many years after his curious death. That adds modern characters and plot to the story, but allows the movie to skip through his life, selecting the scenes that contribute to his curious story.<br /><br />The basic theme is star-crossed lovers. More accurately, crossed lives, living their lives in opposite directions. They meet when each is just a few years old, but that friendship lasts their lifetime. As each approaches the other from the opposite end of the calendar, though, they have a tragically short time for a normal relationship. Although their relationship has long breaks, they continue it anyway, even when it can't be normal. Parts of this will resonate strongly with anyone who's kept love alive even when bodies and minds fail.<br /><br />That love pervades this movie. After massive rejection and betrayal in the first hours of his life, Benjamin is surrounded by the most loving people imaginable and by acceptance that requires disbelief to be suspended. (Suspend it, it's worth it.) Queenie, his adoptive mother, exemplifies that best, with a loving devotion that never wavers - no matter what. Daisy loves him equally, but shows more human weakness in bearing the burden of caring for him. Captain Mike and the crew accept him, as do others.<br /><br />Then, Benjamin looks clearly at the end of life, the failing powers, the lossess, and eventual death. By turning Benjamin's life around, however, this story shows a symmetry between start and end, almost an equation that needs to be balanced. If one word stated the core of this movie, it would be \\"acceptance.\\" This is not just about accepting others, whatever their condition, but accepting the whole of the human condition.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B004O4K4SQ|3.0|I love the bright neon color graphics on my Kindle Fire. This game reminds me of how I'd spend HOURS playing Space Invaders or Galaga on my Atari back in High School.<br />A storyline follows the game throughout each level. This can be skipped but, it is useful at the start of the game, as the as it gives information for the upcoming levels. Some of the storyline is even a bit comical but, if you prefer to skip the story, this can become tedious & annoying, especially if you find yourself needing to restart the level....more than once.<br />Although, I love the game itself, I personally had difficultly maneuvering my ship on my K-Fire, from left to right, as well as firing at the same time, I was unable to get my ship to go or, do quite what I wanted it to do. A joystick with dual controls might prove to be a better feature.<br />I was also unsure what my upgraded weapons were for, what they could do & for how long. As well as, when exactly to use them.<br />A couple of upgrades for a joystick w/ dual controls & the ability to turn off the story after a level (regardless if a levels' win or loss) only then, this game will be sure to keep me from my housework for hours!
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|David is a normal enough high school boy, trying to impress his girl despite the usual kinds of bullies. Then, after a teenish bit of bad judgement, he falls through the surface of a frozen river. Once under the ice, the river's current drags him away from the opening, and from light and air. When his lungs are about to burst ... he and a fair bit of river water suddenly materialize in a familiar library.<br /><br />David is a \\"Jumper,\\" with an incredible ability to teleport himself anywhere, a knack that he soon brings under voluntary control. In teen-off-the-leash style, he makes free with bank vaults and any other interior that holds something he wants, which is pretty much everything. I said that he's \\"a\\" jumper - not the only one. There are others, and there is a secretive cabal dedicated to ridding the world of jumpers.<br /><br />It turns pretty predictable after that. The effects make this flick, especially the fights and chases between two Jumpers. There are worse ways you could kill a few hours on a boring weekend - it really is fair entertainment, with some (but not much) less-than-graphic violence and people who keep their clothes on. I just hope that Samuel L. Jackson isn't betting his career on woofers like this.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Big company so they hype other games so that stinks, but the game itself is awesome. Stopped playing on my phone and went to tablet, much better with a bigger screen.  I think the bonus with not using special tiles is broke. If you match special tiles together it won't give you that bonus. Don't think that's right seeing that special tiles are sometimes on top of the gold ones and you have to get rid of them. Great game though. My wife and I both love it.

B001AK3S4Y|4.0|Hellboy is at it again, saving humankind from supernatural threats that only a handful have even heard of. This time, it starts with an ancient truce between the mundane and magical worlds. We mortals seem to have memories as short as our lives, and have violated the truce. The rulers of the faerie see honor in holding up their end of the pact, no matter what. Others in that land want back what was once theirs ...<br /><br />The effect-meisters have risen to a very high level in this one, populating the world next to ours with a spectacular assortment of beings and a rats' nest of medieval alleyways for them to live in. A few things lack explanation - do most marketplaces have a working ore-crusher conveniently installed in the wall? No matter, it looks good, and comic books (even on the big screen) are at least as much about looks as story and characters.<br /><br />Which is good. Some of the dialog remains a bit comic-booky, rattled bureaucratic functionaries lack depth, and the love interest[s] suit the fanboy generation better than more grownup tastes. The humorous moments save these flaws from becoming ponderous, though. BTW, Liz (hot babe that she is) springs some great sequel-bait on us at the end. So, on the whole, HB2 comes across as what it is: a comic book movie, not the finest of its genre, but a well-done piece of summer entertainment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00008YLV2|5.0|This is not only on top of my war movies collection it's also my most favorite action movie. The action, the emotion, everything in this movie are phenomenal. I notice some concern about the lack of character development from other reviews but IMO it helps to deliver the message \\"it's not about being a hero, it's all about the men next to you.\\" We may not know who the soldiers are but we know they'll do anything to save their comrades. This is one of the best movies I've ever spent money on and will always be. I have the blu-ray, the DVD, and the 3-Disc Deluxe Edition and I'm keeping all of them.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Let's start with the easy part. Whoville is as Seussian as one could hope, right down to the last leggy contraption and skewed piece of architecture. The Jungle of Nool comes across just as well - you can't tell the plants from the animals until one smiles at you, and maybe not then. The animators had the good sense to leave most of their fancier effects at home, and use those other few with generally good taste. The animators' restraint let the good doctor's story come through about as well as one could hope. Unlike other recent movies, this at least lets me enjoy my childhood memories of the original.<br /><br />It's not the original, though, not by any means. That was short enough to read end to end when putting a kid to bed, without tiring your vocal cords. An awful lot happened on the way to making it a feature-length movie. The good news is that most of that lot wasn't too awful. Oh, the pasted-on bad guy, that was very un-Seussily done, but most of the rest fit the spirit well enough. At least, it seemed to. Now I have to go back and check again, but that's not such a bad thing either.<br /><br />It's a good kids' movie. It's pretty much just a kids' movie, though. The best kids' movies have plenty to keep the ticket-buying grownups entertained, too, and I'm afraid this doesn't rise to their needs. But it keeps the kids happy, judging by the little voices I heard laughing throughout - when I could hear them over my own laughter.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B001TODCII|4.0|\\"They kidnapped my daughter!\\" I can't remember how many action movies start that way, including flicks with Bruce Willis, Steven Segal, Chuck Norris, and just about anyone else you could name. It's one of the most heavily used jumping-off points for getting the story going. So, since the basic premise is so well worn, what really matters is where the movie jumps to.<br /><br />Neeson, with hair color not quite matching the lines in his face, does a great job as the wrong guy to mess with. He pounds his way through the seamy side of Paris with grim inexorability, from its grubby underbelly to the highest ranks of society and authority. As you might expect, the bodies of bad guys stack like cordwood. For all that violence, there's remarkably little visible bloodshed, but one or two moments seemed gratuitous. (Was that 'flesh wound' really necessary?)<br /><br />If you're looking for a macho fantasy of righteous wrath, carried out by an implacable and seemingly indestructible loner, you came to the right place. You'll have to suspend disbelief for a while, but this movie's suspense repays the effort.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

B0013ND30M|4.0|At first I want to find some classic cartoon from disney that i like and I found it on amazon and it was a good deal. When I got it and watch it every thing was good.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|There's a lot to like in this movie. It has Amanda Seyfried looking like a younger and cuter Cameron Diaz. Then there's the chick-lit comedy that she leads (or tries to), about strange family secrets emerging on the eve of her wedding. Throw in Abba's bouncy music, likeable again now that the disco era is fading from memory. Then add Meryl Streep in a physically comedic role, with Pierce Brosnan and lots of others pulling their weight. You already know that it's going to end up OK - not just in the romantic plot, but as a movie, too.<br /><br />Lots more makes it work, as well. The ongoing visual gag of the \\"Greek chorus\\" never palls. A few points really stood out, like the bachelor party descending on the bachelorette party, merging them both into some neo-primitive fertility rite (clothes on, if it matters). But Streep and her co-stars really made this movie. She comes across as a strong and active, but decidedly mature character - as befits a woman whose age startled me when I looked it up on IMDB. Two other I-know-that-face actresses form a trio with her, and come from the same age group. I found it absolutely delightful to see these ladies being honest about their ages in these roles, but still as playful as schoolgirls, even to bouncing on the bed and to resurrecting their years-ago girl band to entertain Sophie's wedding eve. Maybe you have to be of the graying age to appreciate it properly, but it was great to see women of my age (and up) with exciting histories and plenty of goofy excitement in their present days, too.<br /><br />But, amid all these enjoyable parts, a few stand out. One was that massive dance routine to \\"Dancing Queen\\" - I laughed so hard that my eyes watered continuously the whole length of it. If you thought that the day of the musical comedy movie ended with [[ASIN:B001BKHU5G A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]], well, you had good reason to think that. New facts just came onto the scene, though, and the musical comedy is back again, at least this once. It's howling funny.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdk again, at least this once.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|I was expecting another basic mahjong game, albeit one with pretty tiles. What elevates this from the mundane is the simple but fun conceit of the comic book like story sections between games. Adding in new aspects like bonuses for clearing the board, quick play, and more all contribute to its high replay value.

B004O4K4SQ|1.0|game doesn't load on DROID bionic. forces close. tried to uninstall and reinstall, and still didnt work. I removed it from my device.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|The good: Lots of great effects and exciting scenes. I saw this in 2D, but lots of coming-at-you scenes must have worked beautifully in 3D projection.<br /><br />The bad: pretty much everything else. The story's logic faltered in just too many places. And, for a movie about a scientist, they got way too much of the science horribly wrong. Magnesium never occurs in metallic form in nature because it's so reactive, birds didn't exist 150 million years ago, and, well, lots more. And, despite his best effort to shake it off, Fraser's [[ASIN:6304711867 George of the Jungle]] seems to stand behind every attempt at a dramatic scene. If you want mindless excitement, great, but make sure you understand just how mindless.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B005VPSEK2|3.0|You know I'm not a proud man or so much of a hipster that I only review / buy more independent music. I've said it before, my friend Josh thinks there is no such thing as 'bad music'.  He's wrong, of course, but I'm not a snob. A music one, that is.<br /><br />I will readily admit to liking half of the last Kelly Clarkson disk, so I bought 'Stronger' pretty much sound unheard. It's not an out of the park winner, but it is not a dud either. Sometimes mediocrity is worse than being bad. Mediocre can be just forgettable, which is not a good thing.<br /><br />Clarkson is a decent vocalist and seems like an ok individual, but some of the writing and production just seems to replicate things she's already done and accomplished  - more of the same to build upon what has made her famous. But usually that practice collapses upon itself when people think you're one-note.<br /><br />This, of course, is usually the way of the record label and / or management trying to preserve their almighty bottom line.<br /><br />From a technical perspective, Clarkson seemingly has the ability to sing most styles of music and succeed, if the song was good. But overall the songs are just kind of 'eh'.  At least with the last disk, there were good ones to run or ride too. Not as much here. And it all just sounds very similar.<br /><br />That said, there are some decent songs - and yes, for riding or running.  Upon first listen, you might not think \\"Honestly\\"would work for a song to ride to - unless you think of a heavy resistance song you'd do a climb to. It's perfect for that.<br /><br />I certainly don't mind the poppiness of \\"Einstein\\".  Yes, \\"dumb + dumb = you\\".  Not a bad song for a treadmill run. I can see this as a single. I can see radio airplay for something like this.<br /><br />Her two first singles don't do much for me - \\"Mr. Know It All\\" or \\"What Doesn't Kill You (Stronger)\\".  Upon it's release, homo blogs made the latter the \\"new gay anthem'. When has that ever worked for us?  I've never been a fan of \\"I Am What I Am\\", \\"It's Raining Men\\", \\"I Will Survive\\" and the such.<br /><br />Sure, I'll take Bronski Beat's \\"Smalltown Boy\\", but I don't have to live my life to Diana Ross' \\"I'm Coming Out\\".  Nor do I have to have Clarkson sing me Nietzsche.  I'm glad she's making a buck from it, but the song is not for me.<br /><br />I hate seeing good talent go to waste and I think Clarkson has potential. She has more than shown it but overall on this disk, it gets squandered.<br /><br />Maybe next time, Kelly.e never been a fan of \\"I Am What I Am\\", \\"It's Raining Men\\", \\"I Will Survive\\" and the such.<br /><br />Sure, I'll take Bronski Beat's \\"Smalltown Boy\\", but I don't have to live my life to Diana Ross' \\"I'm Coming Out\\".

B00004ST9Q|5.0|This is an awesome collection that we are able to show our children who love Whitney Houston..<br /><br />Last summer my little girl and I were playing the WII American Idol singing game and we were competing against each other and we picked Whitney Houston's song and after we finished the song, I said I should have known better than to pick a Whitney song! We did okay per the game, my little girl won!<br /><br />So with this DVD collection we are able to let our children see real talent! This collection contains great video's of her songs etc.. Our children love this collection and so do we! We have all of Whitney Houston's movies and CD's We have always been a fan.. And if you are a fan you will love this collection! (did not think she would be gone so soon). (tears)<br /><br />The DVD contains 23 videos and special features: interviews with Whitney and Artista records and founder Clive Davis per back of this DVD. Lyrics to Whitney's best songs, Impossible from the Disney movie Roger and Hammerstein's Cinderella, The star spangled banner, More Whitney's performances.. Concert for A new South Africa, Live from the Grammy Awards etc! This DVD has so much to offer!<br /><br />I grew up watching Whitney Houston though out the years and I am proud to own her collection. As we viewed this collection I could remember seeing the Video's when they first came out. This is so magical to me... And when ever Whitney Houston performed movies, videos, CD's for me she was so magical!! Feelings of joy and warmth!  We will always miss Whitney Houston! Thank you Lord for the time you allowed us to have with Whitney Houston..<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this collection!<br /><br />Enjoy! We sure are! watching over and over! We would love to see this as a Wii, Xbox, Play station singing game like the Michael Jackson dance game. We sure would buy it and I am sure many others would to.. This is one sure way to continue to sing with Whitney Houston!<br /><br />Thank youHouston family for sharing Whitney Houston with the world...

B001GQSY5K|4.0|As summer feature animations go, this offers a lot to like. Brave good guys, treacherous bad guys, cute and earnest young female lead, a strong parenthood theme, hissing evil female character, and exciting fight scenes. There's plenty of amusing banter between two characters thrown less-than-willingly into the fray together, and victory and feel-goodism at the end. The visual styling works, too. Characters have a chiseled, iconic quality that makes me think of hand carved medieval marionettes, a pleasing bit of anachronism in this far-future setting.<br /><br />As a contribution to the Star Wars canon, I can't give it such high marks - but at least it doesn't have a Jar-Jar in it. My one disappointment was the robots. Until now, R2D2, C3PO, and their kind have always been non-combatants. They've been in the fray, but only in supporting roles. Seeing them in shooting roles took some of the shine off their metal skins, at least for me.<br /><br />I'm sure the True Believers among the Star Wars loyalists will spend vast time and effort moaning over it. I kind of like this one, for itself, but I don't think it's worth getting worked up over, not in either direction.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release

B0067LY4WG|4.0|While Cohen's songwriting or voice has never been an issue for me, his production since I'm Your Man has left a lot to be desired. Cheesy backing vocals, synths,drum machines and that damn Casio. As with his debut & Songs From a Room, Cohen as a performer works best in intimate, stark settings. Old Ideas is a welcome return to that. So on that front, cry \\"hallellujah\\". As for the album as a whole, not every song is great but more often than not, it's exemplary Cohen.<br /><br />Where his last, Dear Heather was disjointed & underwhelming, Old Ideas is more cohesive & substantial. Cohen's wry, if world weary sense of humor is often overlooked by critics & fans alike. Going Home greets you with, \\"I love to speak to Leonard/ he's a sportsman & a shepherd/ he's a lazy bastard/ living in a suit\\". While the closing time gypsy tango of Amen might clock in over 7 minutes, it's a new Cohen classic. Not bad for a 78 year old. Show Me the Place quietly left me stopping in my tracks. The ominous, driving Darkness is another classic in my book, and it's a relief to hear an acoustic guitar figure so prominently on a Leonard Cohen album again. The other major standout is Crazy to Love you.<br /><br />Any \\"Greatest Hits\\" mix would be incomplete without any of the aformentioned. Banjo manages to be both catchy & haunting while the gospel tinged Come Healing is a bit cloying owing to the backing vocals. Lullaby is just that despite the fact that \\"the wind in the trees is talking in tongues\\".<br /><br />The fact that Different Sides doesn't put a button on the ending, may leave some listeners unsatisfied. Seems the intent was to leave things unresolved, as opposed to neatly tied in a bow. Depending on your mood, it pays off--- or not.<br /><br />While quiet & laid back, there's  a dark undertow to these songs. As with all of Cohen's best work, he's not going to shout it from the mountaintops so much as whisper it in you ear just before closing time. As a longtime fan, Old Ideas has left me a very satisfied one indeed. For me, his best since 1979's Recent Songs.t me a very satisfied one indeed. For me, his best since 1979's Recent Songs.

1401201911|4.0|When I heard the premise--baby Superman landing in the Soviet Union--I imagined something very different from what this graphic novel ultimately delivered.<br /><br />Owing to the mid-century influence of the Comics Code Authority, Superman was the champion of a United States in which the American ideal was perfectly realized. I imagined that Red Son would give a similar treatment to the USSR, with young Kal-El growing into the champion of the society of mutual-aid. We could witness Batman and Superman transform from state-sponsored enemies to men with begrudging respect for each other's ideals and abilities. Backed by the good-will of the American people, Lex Luthor wouldn't be forced to sink into depravity, and could just possibly illustrate the moral virtue of the American way of life.<br /><br />Given the prospect of conquering all capitalist opposition, Superman might be forced to struggle with how his presence is preventing the predicted transition of the Soviet Union from socialism (a classless but state-run society) into communism (a classless and state-free society). He might be forced to come to terms with the fact that, as a Nietzschen \\"overman\\", he has no place in the Marxist world he is helping to create. That thread is explored a bit, but I was hoping for some authentic and ruthlessly boring political and moral philosophizing in the tradition of so many Russian authors.<br /><br />Instead, Millar keeps the man of steel much closer to canon. I understand that Red Son was not published under the Vertigo label, and that it fits into a tradition of alternate-universe comic book stories. Given that, I can appreciate a story about a Soviet Superman written with American sensibilities. I can appreciate why Smallville, Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane appear in this story, and the particular philosophizing Millar does explore.<br /><br />There you are. If you were hoping for the former but will accept the latter, it's a decent read.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I saw this cover design in a store but that particular cover was sold out for the Kindle Fire.  I was very happy to find the cover offered by Amazon and promptly ordered it.  I've been using it since the week after Christmas and I love it.  Because of earlier reviews about the elastic being too tight, I had some concerns.  I had absolutely no problems putting my Kindle Fire into the cover.  There's just enough room in the spine to clip a stylus.  There's also a pocket on the inside that is handy as well.  I have to agree with an earlier reviewer who said it isn't worth $40 but the price is in line with the price of other nice covers.
B006B31AHM|3.0|The series is starting to take on a soap opera tone. In the first episode of season 1 TWD put the hook in me, but the hook is slowly wiggling it's way out.  It went from a compelling story of survival, and a \\"what would you do in these shoes\\", to a \\"think they're gonna shag?\\" boring melodrama.  Unfortunately, they won't end TWD until they've wrung out every last dollar, and the marketing team rolls out \\"Got Walkers?\\" T-shirts for $30. What would be great, is for a series to end on a strong note, not a watered-down version of it's former self.

The fact that this has apparently fooled many people who have read this account, out of a hunger to have their own biases confirmed by a \\"historian,\\" is tragic.  In fact, it should be criminal.

So if you like all the Shrek movies, I definitely recommend Puss in Boots so you can see his story before he came into Shrek's life. They start all the way back from when Puss was a baby kitten too and how he came to be the character of Puss in Boots. The main plot with Jack and Jill is interesting and how they add Humpty Dumpty and the female cat. I think it's a great family movie.

0671027344|4.0|I read this book about a year ago, after I was sent it by my mum as a gift. I had heard alot about this book from the internet, and after finding out it was made into a movie I knew I had to read it before I saw it! I was definitely impressed by the writing that Chbosky did, and it was a really good young adult book. The plot was impressive, but at the time I was unable to get through it in one go, and kept putting it off (not that I didn't like it) It has a really good concept of Charlie, and how he is kind of a loner (which we can all relate to from some point in our life)

Drake really has grown so much as an artist, and you can tell on certain songs that he is changing for the better.

I have watched Drake Grow as a writer on this albulm.<br />Songs to really look out for as far as lyrical craftiness (The Ride, HYFR, Shot For Me, Crew Love)<br /><br />PRODUCTION 5 out of 5<br />The sonic sounds of 40 and his growth (40) on productuon has really shined big time on this albulm (Take Care) If you listen carefully to the albulm in some good headphones you can just hear the extra sounds and extra egdy and well put together production on this albulm.<br /><br />I would reccomend this albulm to any true hip hop head or any R@B fan any day of the week , if you enjoy real music that is from the heart, crafty vovab and lryics, great sounds and priduction, great singing and just REAL music then go cop this albulm.<br /><br />I Hope my review helps.<br /><br />Sincerely Ki Double

B006UG90RM|1.0|I doubt I can add anything to other reviewers who are hearing the same terrible album that does not bear repeat listening. The main points are: DLR is terrible, the songs are weak, production is flat. I loved the two songs DLR did with VH on the first compilation, but that was LONG AGO. It's hilarious that VH is in denial of VHIII, and then they put this crap out. Their only great move at this point is to remix and release the original demos. Maybe the 5-star reviewers just love the great idea of DLR rejoining with VH? If you want great old-school metal with insanely good songs, solos, and vocals, my vote goes to Steel Panther...

0679746323|3.0|\\"Mao...was responsible for well over 70 million deaths in peace time.\\"<br /><br />Then Chang and Halliday spent 650 pages detailing the count. A chilling portrait emerged from pages and pages of bodies: this one man, driven by his lust for power and domination, relentlessly left people to die, watched people to die, tricked people to die, and sent people to die. Lives were nothing to him but a number, one that he betted casually in a game of thrones with style. \\"China is ready anytime to sacrifice half of its population for the worthy cause,\\" he announced to the applause of millions to be sacrificed, time and again. In a different time, I could be one of them -- such statements were thought of conveying a sense of honor and courage, which above all, would inspire a sense of pride. And they did. Chang and Halliday, however, told us that perhaps, they were meant literally.<br /><br />For the chilling sensation alone, it was a superb book. I know I will never look at the history of China since 1920 in the same way.<br /><br />But that's about it. The book is more artistic than historic, more fictional than truthful, and more colorful than deep. Chang personally hates Mao, who was responsible for the ruin of her family, and it shows in every line of the book. Emotional authors write powerful books, but emotional historians...nay, there is no such thing as an emotional historian. Passion does not sit through hundreds and thousands of old files for both sides of the story. Chang and Halliday claim they \\"researched\\" for 10 years for this book: interviewing numerous people, unearthing old papers, collecting data from all sources. The book indeed is full of fresh material that I have not seen anywhere else. The \\"Kaihui papers\\", for example, were quoted in their candid entirety. Still, this is no research. Many materials cannot be trusted. Historians would be obliged to verify their sources, or at least cite them. Such practice is not respected in this book. The incredulous phone transcription of Ye Qun, for example, was simply explained as \\"a three-hour telephone conversation that was bugged\\". Much more were quoted out of context, selected without justification, or \\"inferred\\" without bases. Take the death toll of the great leap forward. It is extrapolated from the consensus, a whopping 37.67 million. It could very well be a close estimate, but Chang and Halliday do not even try to convince the readers it is so. This is a topic that has been the subject of lots of serious scholarly research, yet the book does not mention any of them, nor offer any useful insight as to how their number compares to others. Even in history one should not get away without a minimal literature review. And oh, stuff like the \\"communist sleepers\\"...I don't know what to say. It is beyond being incredulous. I cannot imagine what could possibly rationalize such behavior, except that it fits in the conspiracy story the authors seem to enjoy?<br /><br />Chang and Halliday have a hypothesis, and they only see evidence consistent with that hypothesis, which, in turn, strengthens their beliefs in the hypothesis even more.<br /><br />Anyway, so what if this hypothesis is true? Well, it might as well be. What's disappointing is that the book starts and stops at it. Saying, or even proving Mao is a sociopath is not particularly deep. How did such a monster rise to the power? How could he manage to maintain his ruling sitting on so many bodies? Besides people dying, what else happened during the five decades?<br /><br />But Chang and Halliday were not interested in these questions. It's a tremendously focused book. \\"Today, Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital. The current Communist regime declares itself to be Mao's heir and fiercely perpetuates the myth of Mao.\\" Closing the book, I look at the portrait of Mao on the cover, and feel the weighty, silent declaration of war of one couple against a nation's legacy.It is brave.
0307279189|5.0|This book was a great read. I would recommend it for runners and non-runners alike. If your looking for a book that lays down facts about hidden tribes and barefoot running you should probably look elsewhere. McDougall's story jumps around alot and there point's in the story where he most likely made up a dialog, but like I said it's not a documentary.
1451648537|5.0|Very well written biography on a fascinating life.  Steve Jobs is a compelling character.  On the one hand I found myself in constant awe of his genius (and anyone who tries to say he wasn't a genius is kidding themselves).  It would be one thing if he got lucky by collecting the right group of people and developing one hit product.  But this was a man who consistently delivered his vision to the consumers with many hit products spanning different industries.  You would be hard pressed to find anyone who did what he did.  That's not lucky.  On the other hand I found myself wondering why he had to be such a jerk.  I understand that in running a business of any size leaders have to make tough decisions that often times negatively impact the individuals working for them.  However, it became obvious early on that Steve Jobs would purposely treat people badly at times when he didn't need to and he would take it to a personal level.  What's interesting is that both parts, the genius with the vision and the jerk, stemmed from his dominant personality trait..his desire to be in control.  The size of the book may look big, but Walter Isaacson does a great job taking you on the journey.  I highly recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok to pass the time some of the games are very entertaining some are ok. its free so there is no reason not to give it a try.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|The game starts off as an overall pastime, then you quickly find yourself striving to finish it. The game is very fun, but you become more than addicted to it!!
B00006GEB4|4.0|I won't go into the merits of \\"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots\\" - it's been one of my favorites I've returned to on occasion over the past few years.<br /><br />This reissue on red vinyl from Warners does deserve some mention.  The quality is the pressing is high - not quite 180 gram, but thicker than most lps.  However, it squeezes the whole running time of the album on to one disc, so the grooves are cut close together and the sound is a bit too low for my taste.  It has the warmth of vinyl, but lacks the dyamic range it could have had.  This is one that I would have probably mastered on three or four sides for better sound.<br /><br />5 stars for the album; I'm knocking it down a star for a very good - but not exceptional - pressing.
B007BLCGNU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie -- The acttng was excellent and in fact I got so absorbed in the movie, I was unaware that I was watching actors. It was one of those movies that when it ends, you feel like it just started.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Was awesome until the newest update. Application constantly force closes, and my save file was deleted. What was this update even for? We STILL don't have mini games OR zen garden. I updated this app for nothing and now it's unusable. The only reason I gave this three stars is because it used to be good.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app. after scoring 300 points, one can kill super rare fruit... worth 50 to 100 points apiece!
0062060562|4.0|This ended up being a book I could not put down, stay up late, get up early kind of book.  I could not wait to find out what happened next.  The main character of the book, Christine, will haunt me for quite awhile. The author paints a compelling picture of her.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I had been obsessed with Hexage's Robotek for a very long time, and just when I start to get it out of my system Amazon gives me another fantastic game by them.<br /><br />The story makes me laugh out loud at some points, and sit at the edge of my seat for others. The action is brutal and adrenaline-fueled, a little too hard for me even on Easy but I have a slow phone and it makes accomplishments even more exciting.<br /><br />A hearty recommendation to everyone, unless you dislike action games or apparently if you have a droid maxx, whatever that is.
B006ZDS7CE|1.0|This year's Rebecca Black?<br />I might think it was pretty cool if I was a 14-year old girl. Which I am not.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Not slow. Lots of variety. You can earn points or buy them. Seems like the games are endless and they are fun. ENJOY...I sure have. :)
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale plays a machinist who is thin as a concentration camp victim.  He's a sweet guy who is going insane.  He works in a horrific machine shop where he causes a man to lose his arm by accident.<br /><br />A big brute fellow worker befriends him but has a way of not really appearing to be an actual worker after all. Who is he really? And who keeps leaving those sticky notes on his fridge?  What is going on here?<br />People aren't who they appear to be in this masterful psychological thriller of a man breaking with reality.  Things just never add up for this poor tormented guy.  Nothing makes sense.<br /><br />The horror ride at an amusement park was too realistic to be just a ride.<br />That was for me the highlight of the movie.  Anyone with a weak heart would die of fright on that ride.<br /><br />The horror of this character's deathly thin appearance sets the scene for the horrors of his encounters. Everything has a washed out appearance, especially the main character's face.  He keeps on trying to get to the bottom of the odd happenings constantly going on in his life and at the end succeeds.<br /><br />This kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  What in the world was going on? What was wrong with this poor soul?  Would he survive long enough, with no sleep for the past year, and weighing in at probably 80 pounds?<br />Man this guy can act, and from the looks of him in this, is willing to risk his life to make a spine tingling movie. Highly recommended.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|okay, maybe not the best free app of the day ever, but it's up there. This is a great game. It runs smoothly and looks fantastic on my dinc. there's a lot of game and a range of difficulty. most excellent
B0068TL23G|1.0|I immediately uninstalled this after seeing its permssion.vending.billing, wtf all these faotd are changing their permissions when updating you better check yours too
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Fantastic mini-series.  I loved the characters and the story.  I only wish there were more episodes! Great for anyone who loves Downton Abbey.
B005721Y7Y|5.0|AMERICAN BEAUTY (1999)  Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper<br />Rated R.<br />5 Academy awards.<br />Tagline: \\"...look closer.\\"<br /><br />  If this film bothers you, you're not alone.<br />  It does push buttons.<br />  The suburban middle class dream sometimes is not exactly what it appears to be on the picture perfect surface, and it gets taken to the wood shed here. The white picket fence can only hide so much from view before the dark secrets are finally uncovered.<br />  The Thomas Newman musical score is evocative with a hovering sense of sweet melancholy, yet it has a thoroughly haunting,  icy-edged poignancy that cannot be resisted; it reflectively explores the hollow rewards of the death trap known as the rat race with all of its inherent disillusionment.<br />  More than a musical underscore, this is a sublimely eloquent work of art by Newman, perhaps his signature best, so very beautiful that when I hear it, it overflows and I don't know how I can possibly hold it all inside.<br />  This is a film that is funny, sad, disturbing and strangely beautiful.<br />  This movie is new every time I watch it. I never seem to remember everything that it contains,  yet at times it's somehow impossible to forget a single moment.<br />  For cinema lovers especially, this motion picture is a masterfully crafted experience.<br />Warning: This movie is not for those who are looking for simple escapist entertainment or for those who tend to hide their head in the sand. It's far from simple and it's uncompromisingly blunt.<br />  This is as sly as a film can possibly be, where your soul is given the opportunity to connect all the dots, and you're left to discover the true nature of beauty that's always there in front of us.<br />  By any other name...
B000SQJ2SC|4.0|What can I say about Kanye's genius on this album. Knowing this is not his opus, and knowing Kanye has more creativity to spill from his mind. This album marked the beginning with his love affair with instrumentation blending deep into his samples, cuts, and screws. This album is Hip-Hop for the overachievers that know the streets, but choose to stay out of them.<br /><br />This was the mark of Kanye entering musical and life madness. Celebrity started to set in, and this album was the start of his release therapy. In between the the smart punchlines, love vs. misogyny lines, shameless regrets, and laments about fame, Kanye steadies the course to always self-reflect and deliver a message that we all can relate to as average joes with plus-sized IQs.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app has fun short games that help pass the time. it is worth downloading and is fun for all ages.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Get this app NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I LOVE THIS APP. THE BEST PART OF ALL, IT IS FREE. THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE APP.
B000003RCY|5.0|Being familiar with Rammstein songs, one thing added to this purchase which made it worth the money... Its an original disc to own and to collect!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|my son and I enjoy reading the Bible every day.having the Bible on my kindle makes carrying it everywhere we go.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Force closed as fast as i could open it. Wish i could have tried it! Dang it! Please fix? DROID RAZR
B004UHSB5A|3.0|It's fun being able to play dominoes on my phone, but the bugs take away some of the fun. I've seen at least once when the game placed my domino facing the wrong way (e.g., playing a zero/four with the four next to the zero I was playing it on), and it wasn't just a display glitch: the next play by the opponent used the incorrectly-exposed count instead of the correct one. I've also made a couple of scoring plays that the game did not give me credit for. The game play works well; it's hard to see how such bugs could exist in such a simple game.
B000J6I0VG|5.0|This is quite simply my favorite super hero movie of them all!  The plot is simple, but features a couple of interesting twists.  The cast is as diverse as the characters themselves.  It's humorous and serious all at the same time, and the relationships between the characters are realistically portrayed, despite their sundry powers need to save the world (or at least the world of their high school!).<br /><br />Grab some popcorn and hit \\"play\\".  This is the kind of movie that is just plain fun!
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|The title says it all.  The app description claims it was &quot;optimized for high-end devices&quot; and specifically mentions Droid.  Perhaps the author should be more specific, since there are a lot of droids now, or else verify their claims.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it that there are so many different plans.  I am doing Rick Warrens.  It making it so easy to learn how to apply the Bible to my life.  Thank you so much for assisting me to grow in my faith.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is great for people like me who need to write notes and checklists to remember everything!  It lets you organize multiple color coded checklists that you can access even without a wifi connection.  I use this app everyday to help me keep organized. Great app!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Ok, this game is the best alien shooter type of game I've ever played.  Works perfectly on my kindle and nothing gets cut off at the top!  I never want to stop playing it!  So glad it was the free app of the day!  Highly recommended!!!
B00543RC0Y|5.0|The set was pristine. I have only made it to #5 out of 8 and have had no issues.<br />This is one of the rare orders I did not do through prime.<br />The 1st seller, Electronica Direct, well... momma said if u can't say something nice..<br />The 2nd seller, Iren215, Awesome! Paid reg shipping and was in my hands in 4-5 days!
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Mahjong Artifacts is a pretty good mahjong game. The level sets in quest mode have different image tiles so you won't get tired of looking at the same tiles over and over again. The images are nice and the little comics for the stories aren't really the best art but the comics aren't the main point anyways. I like how it autozooms when it's needed. Overall, it's a fun game to play and definitely worth the money.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I thought this game was really good I love it! though there were a few glitches here and there it is amazing.
B006H8BIIM|1.0|I tried this game out, I didn't like it.  Why?  This game isn't the type of game I like.  This is just my opinion, this game would be great (and it is for space lovers) to me if I enjoyed space stuff more.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|All you can do is steer left and right; it does the shooting automatically. At least on the first two levels, it's pretty slow, too, slow enough to be incredibly dull. I gave it up shortly into the second level.
0439023491|5.0|I loved all the action and love in the 1st book in the series, and this book is just as good! The story plot is well written. Each last sentence is a cliffhanger, which makes me want to read more. \\"One more chapter,\\" I say, but I cannot put the book down. I just want to read all of it without putting the book down. Now I will be getting the 3rd book, Mockingjay, because this book does not wrap up like any other book. The last sentence is a cliffhanger as well, so I can't wait to get the 3rd book! I recommend reading this book!
B004O4K4SQ|3.0|worked when I had the DROID 2. but it doesn't work on my new shiny RAZR. it is 5 star game. giving 3 until it works on my RAZR
B006BDHAX0|4.0|My children and I enjoy playing this addictive game. We haven't experienced any middle-of-game shutdowns as others have said, but do get an occasional &quot;freeze&quot; or lapse in game play; hence the 4-star rating. Other than that occasional occurrence, this is a great FAOTD on Fire.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Worth. $.99.  I was amused and found it enjoyable. I recommend it.  There were a few moments where I was stumped.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Pretty good trance/ambient music, ok storyline and I love that you have several ways to control the ship, makes me appreciate the mt4g slide's keyboard even more!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had been looking for a chronological reading list. This had that and more. Wonderful. Great way to learn what God has done for all of us.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Stable on droid x.  Old school look with newer game concepts like they said...moves quick enough.  Fun to play and looks goos.  No obtrusive permissions. Very worth the time to download since it's free!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really liked this.  it was a true point and click adventure.  I've  played PC adventure games since Myst-days, and this was a worthwhile diversion.  Good puzzles, graphics, story.  I saw some comments about navigation but found it similar to other games so it wasn't an issue.  While short, I've spent $10 on a movie that didn't entertain near as well.  Can't beat 1.99.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Low Country Blues is a great album - at 60+ years of age he still has it!  Depsite all the years of hard living his voice is good, the sound amazing and the selection of songs by Allman and T Bone Burnett is perfect.  I love the song \\"Devil Got My Woman\\", \\"Blind Man\\" and BB Kings \\"Please Accept My Love\\", as well as the fact that T Bone joins Allman in playing on many of these recordings. I feel this album reflects the road of his life.  It is a \\"must have\\" for all fans who love their blues.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|this app is pure gold. you will never in your life play a better game. skyrim game of the year? I don't think so. radiant hd is going to be game of the year. mark my words.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really good game for taking up time. kind of hard to unlock all of the games but overall an awesome app
0307593312|3.0|Who are these little people? What do they want? What happened to the professor? Why did the Leader trade his idealism for a fascistic religiosity? In short, 1000 pages of \\"Huh?\\" Characters are introduced and then mercilessly dropped before they are fully developed. Others are spoken of but never seen. There are more random threads and loose ends than can be easily counted. This was my introduction to Marukami. It was interesting enough, I finished it, hence the 3 stars, but the climax was flat, the ending unsatisfactory. I want to read something else of his to find out what all of the fuss is about.<br /><br />Recently saw an ad for a film called \\"The Secret World of Arrietty\\". A Japanese story about Little people. Hmmm.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I bought this even after reading some reviews.  I must say that I am completely satisfied with it.  It snapped in place easily.  The stand does hold my Kindle up, although I wish it did have a more secure way of doing it.  It is lightweight and very easy to use.  I couldn't be happier.  I had purchased a different type of cover for my husband's Kindle ( the kind with small elastic over the corners) and I knew that wasn't the type of cover I'd want to use.  It was difficult to get the Kindle to stay in the cover.  This cover fits like a glove.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The splashtop remote desktop app works better than I expected. I have used it more than I thought I would. Took a trip out of state, accessed my desktop with no problems. I have an extensive music collection and I was able to play anything I desired, no hiccups.<br /> I use splashtop on a Samsung Galaxy 10. What can I say but I love it!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Great graphics! Great control on a touch screen (KF)! You can upgrade weapons and buy extra lives! Boss battles! Well worth the money!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be the FAoTD forever now. And this game has not disappointed me in any way. Radiant has a nice neon 8bit style glow to it that fits well to it's style. The music goes well with the gameplay and has an overall nice vibe. Im playing on my Droid Razr and the game never lags or hiccups. The game itself is very well done for its type of game. It has somewhat of a story with a few puns dropped it. You can customize your ship also. It gets an easy 5/5 from me and I highly recommend to anyone who is a fan of old school space shooters.
0071636080|5.0|I read this book to brush up on my presentation skills and it was a good thing! Just 1 week later one of our corporate presenters called in 2 hours before an event and needed me to present  in his place a presentation I had never seen before. I watched a video of our company founder presenting the information and using all the skills outlined in this book created my own Steve Jobs version of the slide set and hit all key moments well.<br /><br />This book is great for new and seasoned presenters alike.
B005T87QCI|3.0|impossible to defeat metronome don't buy it u will get very angry!!! but it is very fun till u get to metronome but with the free bots none can beat him!!!
B0000071GA|5.0|this is the best krokus album to date the first and only to have steve pace behind the drum kit ,it will basically stand up to any ac-dc recording,storaces vocals are perfect the band are all in time there is no mediocre song here no filler all killer if you dont own this gem well you better this is a masterpeice!!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this. game is ok as long as you are looking for dumb but addictive games. I do like the point system though
B005K17RU0|5.0|perfect weather app for kindle users. I use this app daily to check weather locally or when I travel. download now
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|if only i knew this was available before I bought the other three! oh, well. its the best I've ever read realy:)
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Game sounded like a ton of old school fun but it wouldn't even open to the start page before it force closes. Suck!
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|I don't know about the other reviews but this game works pretty good on the Kindle.  The scores are not covered up and the controls are very workable.  Nice addition to the growing free apps provided by Amazon!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|One of the best game apps I've found to date. The game is VERY strategic, and you might find yourself trying 20-30 times to rescue bugs on some of the harder levels. What I like is that you can go back over the same level to try and get a better score, and minimize the number of moves it takes to free the bugs. I now have my husband hooked on it, and he hates electronic  games of any kind. Hurry up programmers at Blyts and make some additional levels for this game with more rescue tools!!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|i have never read Sherlock Holmes stories before and found them fun with good characters. this is a kindle freebie otherwise I would have deducted a star for the formatting issues. it's not fun to be reading and suddenly hit by an asterisk or dollar sign. like i said, this is free so you can't really complain.
B004O4K4SQ|4.0|so glad this was the free app today.  loads of fun in old arcade style. love the colors. looks great on Kindle Fire.
B0067Q42BY|4.0|this version of mahjong is fun and unique twist on the ancient game. a little bit Indiana Jones and a whole lot of interesting tiles. great way to spend an afternoon.
B001NHZ2KM|5.0|The Who was a three man super group with a great lead singer (similar to Led Zep.) My generation was spoiled on great rock n roll music. I received it fast and in great shape. The kids are alright.
0307949508|4.0|I didn't know quite what to expect from the second book in the series. It started off with a lot of strange things happening to our heroine. At the end everything is pulled together with the explanation of her past. However, it definitely does make the reader want to read the next book. So many things have happened you have to find out how her live will change or not change.
B000V86OKG|5.0|The first season is what got me hooked.  I started watching Dexter on a Christmas Holiday at my sons in NC.  Walter and I enjoy watching Dexter on our own schedule since our schedules aren't always the same we enjoy watching it together.
B006T5FDLG|4.0|like every thing else metallica has expirience their own mistakes and detoures but metallica is and will always be METALLICA
B006UG90RM|3.0|I feel fortunate in that I am a fan of both Van Halen's. I realize that there was a third incarnation, but I consider that to be a scientific experiment gone horribly wrong. I fondly remember when I was a little kid going over to my friend's house and listening to his older brother's vinyl copy of 1984. I absolutely loved it. They also had cable so I saw the videos for Jump, Panama, and Hot For Teacher on MTV. Those memories are indelible. On the other hand, it wasn't until I was a teenager in 92 when I really got into music. The first VH album I actually purchased was For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Again, I absolutely loved it. At that tender young age, I was blown away by the musicianship and Sammy's \\"high octane\\" voice as it was described in an article I read way back when. I then went on to acquire 5150 and OU812, which I also thought were outstanding. Being a naive young kid, I was completely unaware of this Sammy vs DLR debate. Back then, there was no internet so you just liked what you liked; it was a better time really. So now we fast forward to my college days. I took a shuttle bus to campus and the bus driver was playing all this old VH stuff from the DLR era; again blown away. I thought to myself that I must acquire this amazing music. The first DLR era album I acquired was Women and Children First. Having grown accustomed to the Sammy Hagar fronted Van Halen, it took me a while to warm up to the DLR albums, but I soon embraced them as great works in their own right. I was especially impressed when I finally purchased the first two DLR albums; I don't think I need to elaborate. When I acquired 1984, all those great memories came back of my first introduction to the mighty Van Halen. So now, here we are in the present. I give this album 3 stars because of the engineering. I read a few reviews regarding \\"dynamic compression\\" and I must agree with those critiques. The songs on A Different Kind of Truth are amazing, but the engineering is awful. I am old fashioned so I am listening to this album on my stereo and it is just a wall of noise; so disappointing. I can tell that there is some amazing music going on, especially with Eddie's guitar playing. Unfortunately, the great VH sound is lost in the production of ADKOT. Still, a Van Halen album after almost 14 years of waiting is a welcome addition to their legacy. Maybe if I convert the album to MP3 it will sound better. I do miss the backing vocals of Michael Anthony. No disrespect to Wolfgang, but I don't think I'm alone in wishing that the oringinal Van Halen lineup was back together; all four members. Isn't this what we've all longed for? But again, I'm kind of glad I joined the party late because I respect Van Halen's full body of work, both with Sammy and DLR. There's even a few songs I like from Van Halen III. Without You is a great VH song regardless of who is on vocals. I'm just so sick of this ridiculous competition between DLR and Sammy. The two Chickenfoot albums are really great. And aside from the production, the new VH is great too! Eddie and Alex are constants on all of the VH recordings and both of these gentlemen are outstanding musicians. It doesn't really matter to me who is on vocals; the Van Halen brothers will always deliver. I hope there is more great music to come from these guys.
B004XWLN20|1.0|I got this box set for chrismas and got all the way to 6th season and then had problems with the disc. I'm sorry who ever designed the package was an idiot. This is why I have reverted to downloading shows and movies. It is utterly rediculas to spend 200 dollars on a box set to find a disc so scratched up that it is unable to watch it. Beware before you buy this that chances are you are going to end up with disc that are scratched.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I dropped out of the science fiction readers' community several years ago because the books seemed often to be an attempt to disguise romance.  Although The Hunger Games trilogy includes descriptions and demonstrations of strong emotional ties and conflicts, the series is not sexual.  The sense of adventure and unique basis for the stories drove me on and entertained me immensely.  The basis for the trilogy is imaginative and caused me to want to know the characters better and to find out what would happen next. A lot does happen.  The twists are generally tragic but somehow the entire series left me hopeful. I understand from reading some of these reviews that these books are presumably targeted to children.  I can't imagine that a child, unless terribly sophisticated, would have a clue as to what is going on, why it's happening, and may be frightened by the stories.  Even I was frightened sometimes.  Or, perhaps, I'm not terribly sophisticated because I thought this was at least good or even terrific adult reading.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|ok games still trying gain points trying to open games my three year old likes some of the games some are too hard for her yrt
B0064X7FVE|3.0|this app is nice, but it gets stuck on yesterday's weather all the time. the sync button doesn't fix it, you have to go into the settings and force stop the application to get it to reset. very annoying! otherwise, i like it.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This is the 2nd time I have seen this movie, and I have loved it each time. Steve Carrell, Ryan Gosling - both perfect. Must see for anyone who is a fan of these two actors. It will make you smile.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day and I love it.  it's. entertaining and I really like that it saves your place so you don't have to start all over again.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Bluntly, I really like this game!  It's more than a Space Invaders/Galaga clone with a bit of modern styling, and has a great little upgrade system for your many weapons.  No, you don't find out what they do at first, but to me, it's part of the fun experimenting to find out what works best for me.<br /><br />The simple 8-bit graphics style with the glow effect is quite pleasing on the eyes.<br /><br />If you like shooting aliens by sliding back and forth on the screen shooting forever to cause their doom, you'll enjoy this.  If not, it's the free app for today that can be uninstalled in a flash.  :)<br /><br />Played on Kindle Fire with no issues whatsoever.
B004A8ZWWY|2.0|I mean, it takes all kinds, and clearly some people like it. I suspect people who did not like Tower Heist aren't taking time to review it, or just avoided it altogether. But since it took 2 hours of my life (and i was all set to like this movie, btw) I feel the need to point out: It wasn't funny, or effectively dramatic, the trailer told you the whole story. Once finished, you realize the story is just ... too impossible to take remotely seriously. It's a desperate rental at best.
B00637HXNG|5.0|The Scorpions rock!!!  This disk will play in a blu-ray player but you do not get to see the 3D content.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Quits on my droid x instantly.  Can't even open it after I reinstall it. Lame lame lame lame lame lame
B0054JZC6E|4.0|absolutely love this game...run out of point pretty quick but fun overall...would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes a lot of games
B0064MT1NU|4.0|This Blu-ray is a vast improvement over the previous 1080i Australian release.<br /><br />The absence of subtitles for the sign language between Ada and her daughter as well as the Maori dialogue is unforgivable.<br /><br />Apart from the very grainy dark scenes; the Blu-ray's quality shines through in the better lit scenes.<br /><br />This Blu-ray is far from perfect; it will take a bit more dedication to restore it to its original glory. However, for $12.99 I feel it was worth the purchase. If I had paid as much as I did for the Australian release I would be compelled to return the disc.<br /><br />As much as I miss the subtitles; this release deserves more than 1 star.<br /><br />For anyone interested; I have posted the missing subtitles with their timings in the comments below.<br /><br />Note: This Blu-ray is locked to Region A
B0055EAJ7A|5.0|Great fantasy with good characters. Classic bad vs good with wonderful CGI. Thor is a heartthrob...and even the villain gains some sympathy. Well written.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This and Bakery Story are my two favorite games; I was so happy to see that Amazon finally has them available. I have been playing this for several months on my Droid and now will start over on the Kindle with a larger view. Would like to transfer the account from my phone, but their website seems to only have transfer for the Apple products.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app so much... it is the funnest game to play in my fifth hour..it is so amazing
B0058VW36U|1.0|Its not working for my Kindle Fire and I'm sad anyone can help pweese.): I really really really really wanna play it and my dad wasted $1 on it
B0058RCVYS|5.0|I would love to describe my feelings about this movie but I can't, I'm still under great emotion.<br />We watch this movie with my wife without stopping it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game/games are fun however, It's hard to get points at the beginning. It's a game where you almost never get bored.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app, sometimes just as fast to surf my browser on my computer. Good interface, not perfect but gets the job done.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|this game is good for my 5year old no killing or blood.They need to make more games like this.This game is fun
B005CKPQHA|5.0|I was told by one of my co-workers that \\"you have to watch Breaking Bad...It's awesome\\".  So, after searching through the usual cable TV pap and finding nothing new interesting (how many times can you watch \\"How It's Made\\"?), we started watching Breaking Bad using more conventional viewing such as renting the DVDs. First it was Season 1.  Then, Season 2.  Then Season 3.  Then, uh-oh, Season 4 is nowhere to be found on DVD.  My wife and I felt withdrawals as strong as those looking for their next \\"fix\\".  What to do?  Enter Amazon's streaming service for Season 4.  I couldn't get my credit card out fast enough to get our next fix of this fantastic show.  We weren't disappointed and gladly paid the $20 streaming fee.<br /><br />Now, it's true that streaming isn't as convenient as the way we were used to watching BB.  But, after hooking up the laptop to our HDTV, we settled in and began our Season 4 adventure.  This is one of the few series that actually get better with each season.  And, Season 4 was no exception.<br /><br />If you are thinking about streaming this season, DO IT!  You won't be disappointed!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great game. it is very fun.btw keep on sending revises til it hits 1,000.....never know they might do something cool
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Thank you for offering this game for sale at a great price and in perfect condition!  My kids, ages 12 to 21 love this game and play it over and over.  I love that they are playing together, playing a game that involves thinking and they enjoy it.  YOur service was wonderful and the game was in perfect condition.  Thank you so much!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love that there are so many mini-games :D also you can play and get coins so you can get more games and the play those games and buy even more games
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I really looked forward to reading this book but was very disappointed. It is boring! I expected it to be incredibly funny. It is not!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|What a great book. Once I started I just could not stop. This book just like the others has a way to suck you in to every detail. I hated to have it end.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|For the past 6 years I've been conscious of sound quality I've always avoided cans, sticking to the flexible in-ears for home/on-the-go use, but they all broke down soon and past worthy repair, and after my Etymotic er-6i's(great cheap in-ear btw) finally wore out I decided to buy these and JVC HA-RX700s to test out and I have to say I prefer these AKGs.<br />They're both cheap good headphones but the AKGs fit a lot better and I haven't had a chance to burn in either for long but I've been leaning with these all the way.<br />Definitely a solid buy.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent product - makes my kindle fire much more useful. It allows me to check and make changes while on the road.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Can't even play this game. Force closes at startup every time. Need to fix app to be compatible with Droid RAZR.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I know development doesn't happen overnight, but I hope it happens soon. Ice Cream Sandwich has been available for long enough to make an update possible, and it's going to be on *a lot* more phones and tablets really soon (like my Asus Transformer, on which the game is now unplayable). Please update.  :-\
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Runs great on my Toshiba Thrive. If you like Mahjong even a little than this is the game for you.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|a really fun game! such perfect execution! the dialogue is great and the multitude of weapons are fun! definitely a 5/5!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love these kind of games and this isn't the best one yet. The price is a bit steep but it's still worth it if you enjoy these types of games
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Can't put it down!  Great retro space invader clone with a modern twist.  Works flawlessly on Acer A500 tablet.  Best faotd game in awhile
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|Unplayable on Droid X.  Will not even make it to the opening screen.  Very disappointed and glad i got it as the free app of the day rather than actually paying for a non working product.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|big fan of these games. looks great on kindle fire. a must have for any gamer. five stars..ADD ME..neighbors make the game a lot more fun. my storm 8 id is AVERAGERICH3
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|Force closes on startup for gnex. Wish they wouldn't put this on the market if it doesn't work on all devices
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game to make the time go by.  It takes your mind off of everything to figure it out.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|A very boring movie, I had to force myself to watch it to the end.It does not compare to Fireproof.
0470876417|5.0|Content:<br /><br />This book is a must read for anyone attempting to start a new company; or a person who wants to learn how to start a company. Anyone can benefit from the information presented in this book, and at the very least the book will get you thinking and your creative juices flowing. Interesting ideas presented and described clearly with intent to teach you new ways of constructing a business model.<br /><br />Presentation:<br /><br />The presentation of this book is great, many visuals and the pages are broken down in a manner that makes you want to actually read everything. Pages are not cluttered with filler to make the book longer; however, all important information seems to be available. Graphics are great and the flow of the book is very easy to follow.<br /><br />Only one drawback here - the shape of the book makes it hard to read in bed - but that's nothing too serious.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|after a long week and having to wade through my apartment garage yesterday I was ready for a day of rest. so I downloaded the faotd and prepared for fun. I loved space invaders as a kid so I felt this would be fun. unfortunately before I could start playing I had a knock at the door. it was my boy Henry who had a pizza with him I thought what could be better than a free app and a free pizza. to bad henry didn't tell me he added the mushrooms to the pizza. next thing I knew I was being attached by giant glowing space ships and I even threw a chair out my front window. beware of this app because it is too realistic.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love this game. Hours of mindless fun and very addictive. A good way to take your mind off of every day strife. Just spread your &quot;wings&quot; and glide.
0312576463|3.0|SPOILER ALERT.  IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK, YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS REVIEW.<br /><br />A long time ago, when I was reading everything I could about the Ancient Egyptians, I read somewhere that they had invented graph paper so that they could ensure that their wall art and engineering works were as precise as possible (bear with me).  According to my source, they were positively obsessed with having everything be in its proper proportions.  And that's the feeling I got when I read \\"Freedom\\".  I felt like Mr. Franzen had plotted each and every character on his or her own piece of graph paper, leading to a very precise enumeration of said character, but one in which the character did not have any room to breathe.  And I also felt that he had done the same thing with the story.  And, yes, as other reviewers have said (especially the ones giving the book 1 star), there are a lot of improbable elements in the book, giving it a \\"John Irvingish\\" tinge, but that still does not mean, as far as I am concerned, that there is anything truly spontaneous in this book.  Now, don't get me wrong.  I am very, very partial to \\"world building\\" science fiction books, and books with lots of back story,  and you can dump your info-dumps on me any time, but I still like to read a book that seems to be alive and breathing.  I kept reading because all the detail was fascinating to me, so much so in fact that I felt like a sort of voyeur.  That's when I didn't feel like I was reading the writing of a professional gossip.  I kept on reading even though the book felt as stiff and lifeless as one of those Egyptian tomb paintings, because I wanted to see what weird thing was coming up around the next bend - I guess for the same reason that people rubberneck a roadside accident scene.  I kept reading even though I really did not care about any of the characters and what was going to happen to them.  In the end, even with all the details of the plot and of the main character's personal lives, I was left knowing very little about why any of them did the things they wound up doing. In short, I think the book is well-written on a technical level, but does not really hang together as a novel.  There is just a total lack of feeling there.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />P.S. I could not feel any liking or empathy for any of the main characters, all of whom, with the exception of Richard and Lalitha, basically seemed to be dishonest and/or dislikeable in so may different ways.  I liked Richard because \\"what you saw was what you got\\" - there was no real hypocrisy there.  I did not know what to make of Lalitha - I did not get a good feel from the author about what motivated her, but I also that that \\"what you saw was what you got\\".  Connie was a cipher - I don't know what Joey saw in her, and the author does not communicate this.
B004O4K4SQ|1.0|looks fun, but I'll never know. force closes instantly. Droid incredible (1), I understand my device is no longer a &quot;high end device&quot; but this is the first app I've ever had a problem with. I think it'd rather amusing the second an app becomes the FAOTD it's real problems come out. The star rating keeps getting lottery and lower throughout the day.
1401937519|5.0|I just finished reading this book.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I saw Anita in Pasadena in October, and since then couldn't wait to get the book.  It was worth the wait.  She is such a beautiful, humble, 'magnificent' woman.  She relates her experience in such an inspiring and uplifting way.  Kudo's to her husband Danny who was by her side every step of the way, truly showing by his example how a spouse should behave during sometimes time of illness.<br />I'm so glad Dr. Dyer gave her a public spotlight, but I believe this story would have been made into a book even without his help.<br />The book itself is easy to read (I couldn't put it down), it is awesome and inspiring.  I recommend it to everyone regardless of their interest in NDE's.  It's a book about life, about love... it's a book for everyone.
B00030DEQE|5.0|Installed this pci network card and has been streaming for 2 days now.<br /><br />the pci card came with a install CD; Hardware/Software were a breeze and I'm no engineer...<br /><br />Just followed the instructions(simple) 0n the readme/owners manual and install was perfect<br /><br />installed in a dual-boot pc with XP Pro/Win7 Ultimate<br /><br />Updated the xp driver @ INTEL  and  Win7 had its own driver.<br /><br />Will update this review in a month or so but all is well now<br /><br />Intel Rocks...!<br />Amazon Rocks...!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|This game his hard to put down for even a second. I love. I am glade they put this up for free.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie! Justin and Mila were so cute together! They had great chemistry. And the movie was hilarious! It was much better than I expected. Originally, I didn't want to buy it because it reminded me of \\"No Strings Attached\\", which I loved, but this was just as good if not better.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is a great classic, the weapons a awesome, and the graphics are bright and interesting. The story is also not bad, and somewhat funny.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|sadly it won't load in my EVO 4G. not many games force close on it but what can I say? look cool thought.
B005ZUR724|2.0|please fix, cant update game to play<br />I tried to update but it wont let me, its a shame I cant play, I really love this game
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I just rented this last night and it has everything a movie needs to be successful. It's exciting, touching,and thought provoking. It basically asks,\\"What would happen if the sweet little E.T. of 1982 had been bigger, captured, held prisoner for 20+ years abused and then gets lose?\\"<br />As an audience we are first scared with the the abundance of confusion and at the end we are angry at the inhumane humans and then deeply touched by the simple love of family that finally is realized.<br />This movie is great for all age levels but if there are family members younger than 8, Mom or Dad should be there as support because it's got some graphic scenes.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|this series is easily on my top favorites list of bbc comedy.  (the others being \\"are you being served?\\"  \\"keeping up appearances\\" \\"mr. bean\\" \\"chef!\\"  \\"absolutely fabulous\\" \\"the thin blue line\\" \\"black adder\\" \\"only fools and horses\\" \\"monty python\\" among so many others).  i know i could watch these series streaming on various sites, yet it's the bonus content alone that's worth the purchase price.  john cleese's insight gives it so much more depth and meaning as to how he and connie booth came up with such clever story lines and dialogue.  this is a great series to introduce people to bbc comedy for the first time as it's something that takes time to get used to.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Twice since originally downloading this app Amazon let me know there was an update to this app.  Both times all of my progress was reset on my Droid 2 Global.  It is an embarassment for an app at this point to have such a feature.  There is no excuse.<br /><br />Aside from reseting all my progress twice, the game functions well.  It clearly isn't actually made for widescreen displays, it is a smaller image stretched but most of the time it isn't an issue, it just makes it clear that overall this game does not have the polish you may expect from other apps out there.  I am surprised PopCap allowed this app to be released, usually they are a quality developer.  I find it hard to endorse this game in a serious way through the Amazon store.  Works great on my iPhone and iTunes... anyone who can should save their money for that version.
0553381695|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviews. There were chapters that really dragged. I was so glad to see Davos killed off. I could care less about his character and a large portion of this book was devoted to the ramblings of the Onion Knight. But of course, the ending left me curious about what will happen next. So I will have to purchase the sequel.
1416550550|1.0|This book was overly predictable and unlikely for me, with outcomes you could see miles ahead. For me thsi made it very disappointing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have Evernote on my laptop, my Kindle and my Droid smartphone. I can enter notes wherever I am. I can access them whenever I want. Peace of mind!
0385344228|4.0|As a former criminal prosecutor and as a trial lawyer defending major civil cases, I can speak to the accuracy of Defending Jacob's trial sequences, the center of this entertaining and well-written novel.  Landay conveys properly the truth that everything that happens in a courtroom is evidence, including the non-verbal behavior of each participant and each spectator.  As a parent and spouse, I can say that the complex relationships depicted in Defending Jacob sound authentic.  Without giving away too much of the novel -- and I haven't read the other 100+ reviews, so if anyone ever reads this review, he or she might know everything I'm trying to protect anyway -- I will offer a few minor criticisms: (a) the testimony of the main police witness against Jacob is virtually all hearsay and objectionable, yet Jacob's attorney never objects; (b) what are intended to be surprises -- the twists of plot -- do not surprise (at least they didn't surprise me) except for the very ending.  As I think about comparisons to the work of Scott Turow, I can say I enjoy Turow's writing more, but that's like saying an A+ is better than an A.  So, with all that, I highly recommend Defending Jacob.[[ASIN:B006WEHL6E Community and Other Stories (Nate & Adel and Other Stories)]][[ASIN:B005KB98R0 Nate and Adel and Other Stories]]
B006ON41FC|5.0|big fun for the kids, they dont get all that far but really enjoy it.  good time waster while mama watches the oscars.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I bought this over a year ago for my Samsung Fascinate it is incredibly fun and has a great story with a little humor intertwined.<br /><br />I would get a little glitch occasionally where everything would slow down and I would have to restart the game, but maybe, Hopefully that is foxed by now. Even if it hasn't it is still a 5 star game to me as if happened seldomly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Easily the most used, most useful app I have. The capacity for organization and keeping track of all my compulsive lists, recipes, addresses, quotes, and book lists helps keep my life paperless and in one accessible place. I heartily recommend this app.
B004O4K4SQ|2.0|This game makes a valiant attempt at creating a retro gaming experience, but falls just a little short.  The basic gaming template the creator is trying to produce involves two key inputs; directional movement and a fire button.  Unfortunately, this game denies you the pleasure of firing.  You are tasked only with left and right movement.  This makes the game rather boring.  The graphics hit the mark, but the automated shooting denies the player the full pleasure of the genre.
B006ON41FC|4.0|A great time wasting game.  If it weren't for Feint lagging game play sometimes, I would have given five stars.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I hate this game don't download it. the games are not even fun. you have to buy the games in the app! don't download it.
