B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never watched \\"The Biggest Loser\\" but when searching for workout dvds, I saw this one had the most reviews so I thought I would give it a try.  Especially since 15 minutes of weights and 30 minutes on the treadmill weren't making any difference.    It's been a week now and I have to say this is the only workout I've stayed with for longer than 2 days.  She does basic moves, no special dance moves or crazy things that I can't do (I have little to no coordination) but you can FEEL it.  There are 3 Levels, each 20 minutes long.  All you need are some hand weights and a mat.  I'm only about 10 pounds overweight but I'm horribly out of shape.  I have no endurance and very little muscle strength so the first couple of days I couldn't finish the entire workout.  And that was just Level 1!    I just moved on to Level 2 and I'm dripping sweat but I had to write this review.  The scale says I've only lost 2 pounds but I FEEL so much better.  My pants aren't as tight.  If I workout in the morning, I feel more alert during the rest of the day.  But more importantly, my mindset has changed.  I'm inspired to try harder!  I start out my day with green tea instead of coffee and I've phased out most of the processed food from my diet.  I still eat what I like but in much smaller portions.  I start out my day with more liquids and I find I crave salty foods much less.    The hardest part for me was just getting to the gym.  I can walk there but I always had an excuse: it's too cold, it's too windy, I'm too tired, I'll go tomorrow (and of course I never did).  Now I have no excuse.  It's 20 minutes in the morning or when I get home from work.  The time flies, I'm not bored, and it seems to be working.  During the 3rd circuit of Level 2, Jillian says \\"You should feel like you're about to die right now.\\"  So I must have been doing it right.  :)    I have a month until my wedding and I'm trying to lose the 10 pounds by then.  If I can lose 2 pounds a week, I think I can do it.Give it a try and good luck!!
031606792X|1.0|i'm currently reading breaking dawn, but i've decided to stop. i'm right before the part where we are told the story from Jacob's view. The reason why i don't want to read it it's because i am very, very dissapointed. I absolutely loved the first three books, although i have to say that in Eclipse, i was pissed off when Bella realises that she actually \\"is in live with Jacob\\". I mean COME ON! But i decided to give it another chance, so i purchased breaking dawn. where to begin? the marriage, the baby? and i've read some of the reviews and i am absolutely positive that i wont like what is coming, so i'll pretend that they just \\"lived happily ever after\\".....this book could have great potential...it's too bad
1932907009|5.0|This book was the light in the storm for me. I was on the third draft of my screenplay when I finally decided to read this book which I had for months. Once I read it, it was like the flood gates opened up and my story emerged triumphantly. I pounded my way through the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet which is now a template on my computer for all future screenplays. This book and the methods that Blake Snyder lays out put everything into perspective. This book was a life saver for me and I feel like my writing is already benefiting from Blake's ideas.  Thank you Mr. Snyder!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|A long time ago in the last millenium, 1978 to be precise! A 6 year old boy in Florida went to see the movie that made him love the cinema and classics throughout the whole 20th century... STAR WARS! At a drive-in theater no less! In 31 yrs. I've seen it everyway possible, no joke! In the early '80's i saw it on H.B.O. My best friend in the whole world had it on video disc( yes, I said video disc!) he also had it on laser disc. I bought it when it came out on VHS and on DVD I have the remastered before the extra scenes, I have the added scenes edition.I even have the un-remastered originals on DVD(and none of it is pirated they are all distributed through Lucas films and 20th century Fox). so all I'm saying is If you love it the way I did and still do, then this is a must have!!!!!!!!!!!!!!MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU...ALWAYS!
B000V699E6|5.0|Why is it this album's been out for years and no one has ever written a review?? Shame on you, dudes. I think Steinman's absence is the reason a lot of people didn't care for this cd, however I think that it has a great escapism feel to it in that adventurous 1940s south-of-the-border kind of way. Meat Loaf was inspired by the pulp novels of back-in-the-day and gave the stories an emotional twist that is seen through the eyes of the man in the shadows, the questionable do-badder who kills for love or runs from the cops with the buxom blonde vixen in the passenger seat armed with a pistol in the air. Throughout the cd, the question is basically \\"How far am I willing to go for this?\\" I think it's a total ride and I love listening to it every time.  \\"Where the Rubber Meets the Road\\" is a good kick-off track that establishes that the listener is about to go on a serious rollercoaster ride of moralistic integrity with a song all about sex. It's a no-brainer, really.  \\"I'd Lie for You (and That's the Truth)\\" was probably the ONLY song released as a single that didn't grab enough people and convince them the to buy the disc. The music video looked like it was shot in the middle of Desert Storm and wasn't too fantastic. It became blatantly obvious they were trying to rehash \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\" success with such an operatic plot involving some artifact that Meat Loaf and Girl find while being chased by bad guys. Then Girl betrays Meat and gives bad guys the artifact, revealing she was allied with them all along. Anyway, this is a great duet song for a non-Steinman piece. I love it.  \\"Original Sin\\" is one of my favorites. It revolves around that whole moralistic integrity thing I mentioned earlier, resulting in Meat (or the character, I guess) wondering if what he's doing is the right thing and what the long-term consequences will be. This is actually the only song on the album written by Steinman, which is probably why it's so damn great.  \\"45 Seconds of Ecstasy\\"is a great little ditty about (what else?) sex. I love how it segues perfectly into \\"Runnin' For the Red Light\\" which tells of the devotion Meat feels for his renegade partner-in-crime and the party-hardy times that are ahead of them.  \\"Left In the Dark\\" is a great great tearjerking song. Girl comes home to Meat at quarter to 3 in the morning when she should've been there by 7pm and he wants to know why. Rips my heart out every time. Great vocals and emotional scoring here.  \\"Not a Dry Eye in the House\\" follows up \\"Left in the Dark\\" almost as a continuing song with a different pace that displays the stages of falling in love and breaking up in the 4 acts of a play.  \\"Amnesty Is Granted\\" has Meat willing to forego all the dirty deeds he and Girl have done for the sake of giving their relationship another shot, despite the fact that she's crushed him. This is an okay song, I tend to skip over it.  \\"If This Is the Last Kiss\\" was, I believe, inadvertently meant to be the duet single that followed up \\"I Would Do Anything For Love\\" but failed miserably as a 2nd single (after \\"I'd Lie For You\\") because it just didn't have that musical sweeping kick to the gut like the others did. It sounded a bit too contemporary for my tastes, honestly. Storywise, this is the finale of Meat and Girl basically making out for the last time before they go their separate ways.  \\"Martha\\" finds Meat 40-ish (?) years later trying to track down the Girl. This time we actually know her name. Meat recalls their wild adventures together in a slow, sweeping epic of a song that makes my lip quiver occasionally...  But it's \\"Where Angels Sing\\" that really brings me to my knees. When I need a good cry, I listen to this song. Basically they've both died and Meat wants to find her in heaven to be with her forever and never worry about losing her again. This song holds a high-ranking place on my list of saddest songs.  Fantastic piece of work. There, finally...a review for an incredibly underrated album!
B00005JLR2|4.0|Directed by Disney's Ron Clements and John Musker, comes the astounding tale of adventure, growing-up and heroism. Jim Hawkins (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) stars as a teenage boy who is lost in a sea of sadness and trouble. When a mysterious star ship crashes onto the dock of the Benbo Inn, Jim investigates and finds a dying pilot by the name of Billy Bones, who gives him a treasure chest and warns him of \\"The Cyborg.\\"<br />Earlier that day, Jim was in trouble for speeding on his Solar Surfer in a restricted area, and was brought home to the disappointment of his mother, Sarah Hawkins (Laurie Metcalf). She points out to a close family-friend; a dog-like being by the name of Doctor Doppler, (David Hyde Pierce) that Jim has been a trouble-maker ever since his father left. She is \\"literally,\\" at the end of her rope and doesn't know what to do to motivate her son.<br />But ever since Jim was little, he dreamed of finding the \\"Loot of a Thousand Worlds,\\" which is stowed away at the farthest reaches of the galaxy. This loot was collected by the notorious Captain Flint, who kept it all in a place known as: Treasure Planet (Ring any bells? Of course, Treasure Planet is based off of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel: Treasure Island, which was written way back in 1883).<br />After recovering the chest from Billy Bones and carrying him back to his mother's inn, the place is soon attacked by a group of pirates. Jim and the others (excluding Billy Bones, who died soon before and opened the chest for Jim) race up to the second story and escape by leaping down to a carriage provided by Doctor Doppler. The inn is destroyed and nothing is left for the Hawkins family but an odd little sphere from the chest.<br />The sphere is soon revealed to be a map to the one place Jim has dreamed of journeying to; Treasure Planet. After arguing with his mother, and with the help of Doctor Doppler, they commission the RLS Legacy which is crewed by an odd group of characters, First Mate Mr. Arrow and its sharp-minded Captain Amelia.<br />Jim is brought down to the kitchen where he meets The Cook, Mr. John Silver, a cyborg with a strange gold eye who has a pet called Morph, an adorable shape-shifter. A father/son relationship forms between the two, which is shown between chores and flashbacks of Jim's childhood with the song sung by John Rzeznik, \\"I'm Still Here.\\"<br />But the adventure turns senile when Mr. Silver reveals himself as Captain Silver, a pirate who is after the map. Jim and the few loyal fugitives, including Captain Amelia and Doctor Doppler \\"jump ship,\\" and escape to Treasure Planet where the adventure continues in \\"cat-and-mouse-game,\\" between Jim and Silver. There Jim meets Flint's abandoned robot B.E.N (Martin Short) who has lost most of his memory and pesters Jim continuously through the movie. They find a hiding place, with the help of B.E.N, to rest and knowing that if they try to leave they would be shot on sight.<br />But while Jim sneaks back to the Legacy to recover the map, their hiding place is invaded by Silver and his pirate crew. When Jim returns with the map, it is taken by Silver and Jim's determination forces Silver to bring him and the rest along to find Flint's treasure.<br />With the help of Jim, they find The Loot of a Thousand World's by a portal that was revealed by the map, used as a key. But while inside the middle of the planet where the loot is kept, the crew cross-over into a dangerous trap that was set by Flint.<br />The planet starts to destroy itself, Silver's crew race to escape while gaps open, fires rise up and the treasure starts sliding down into the planets fiery depths. Jim and Silver must figure out a way to escape the planet which is set to explode. But can anything convince Jim that Silver isn't as cold-hearted as he thinks, and Silver find that Jim is far more important then a loot?<br />This is a wonderful movie and is actually my favorite animated film. I shall this in theaters when I was but twelve, and eventhough the movie was a flop at the box office, only selling $110 million worldwide, it is still up there with the greatest.<br />When the film was released on DVD, it did do better and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Animated Feature, but was downfallen by Spirited Away (an anime film).<br />If you want an animated movie with the adventures of science fiction, the charm of Disney and the background of piracy and treasure hunting, Treasure Planet is a definite watch.

B001GKJ2FW|5.0|I saw this movie on the big screen that I am embarrassed to admit it. I took my daughter, then for my birthday, my daughter took me, then we both took her friends and then she bought the DVD for me for Christmas and I can look at it whenever I want to! Guess what I did? I looked at it whenever I wanted to, still do!    Pierce and the guys were gorgeous and all the girls were great and the generous sprinkle of fairy dust that the director got busy on was a magical idea, it enchanted all of us, but it was Meryl Streep that put the main ingredient in. After seeing Mamma Mia! I became an instant fan of hers and have sinced looked at all her movies. She is incredibly talented!    Meryl or anyone who knows Meryl, please tell her that the summer of 2008 got her tens of millions more fans and some are as young as my 13 year (then 12yrs) old girl and her friends. She carried that movie to the success it has become because she is who she is--Meryl Streep! I'll say it again, Meryl Streep!
B000E1JOSE|1.0|If I wanted to buy a concert recording, I would.  I don't, and this CD's cover says NOTHING about it being a so-called 'live' recording (as if studio recordings aren't done 'live').  For my purposes, a total waste of money because I buy CDs for music, not clapping and whistling audience members.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|Certainly this film isn't for everyone. If you are the type to like the popular, big production Hollywood films like Titanic, Independence Day, Armageddon, or anything of the sort... then this film may be too abstract and unpredictable for you.<br /><br />It is a dark and ominous movie, but probably doesn't qualify for being classified as a Horror film. It's more of a psychological thriller. If you are in your late 20's to mid 30's (if you grew up in the 80's), you should appreciate much of the 80's themes and music. I highly recommend this film to anyone in that age group who is able to handle a more complex, deep, and symbolic story. This is not the movie for someone who likes cliches.
B00076NYFK|5.0|i'll keep it short and sweet, while living in england i have experienced many bands befor ethey got big. i'm surprised that die hard quo fans haven't written the joys of this album. it's the most comercially accessable and is a great happy type pop album. every song is a winner. if you say you love the quosters than do youself a huge favor and get this pronto. just a highlight \\"layby lover\\" is a quo classic. do your ears a favor and get this gem.

There's about two songs on the cd that I can take or leave but all the other songs I really really like.  All other rammstein cds only had maybe two songs on each of them that I liked and I hardly wanted to listen to the rest but this cd is a true gem and definitely worth owning.
B000002AGE|5.0|From reaching at #1 on the Billboard jazz album chart to hitting #30 on the pop album chart, this classic 1977 release quickly became a fusion masterpiece.<br /><br />Birdland - a Joe Zawinul composition, along with the beautiful ballad, A Remark You Made and The Juggler - quickly became a signature number for WR and a cross-over sensation that will continue to bring listeners into electric jazz. Teen Town and Havona by Jaco Pastorius show his maturation as a composer, with Wayne Shorter nothing less than solid with his numbers, Harlequin and Palladium. Percussionists Alex Acuna and Manolo Badrena penned the snappy Rumba Mama, which is from a live performance at the 1976 Montreux Jazz Festival.<br /><br />A tour-de-force of artistry, it turned a superstar jazz group into international pop stars who transcended the labels during the era that shoved music into pigeonholes.

0393324818|5.0|The previous Michael Lewis books I have read were all very well written, Moneyball is too. This is a well told story about an interesting topic. The fact that the actual topic of the story is arcane and normally quite dull makes the fact that the book was entertaining and engaging even more of an accomplishment.    Moneyball is about how the Oakland A's were able to compete as one of the top teams in baseball even though they had a much smaller budget for player salaries then their competitors. Since the best players are the most expensive, that should not have been possible.    The A's were able to do it by having better information then the other teams. They did a better job of evaluating prospective players then other teams. So they were able to find players who would be good, but that were not wanted by other teams.     They were able to find those undervalued players by better use so statistics. Moneyball tells the story of how those statistics were noticed and how they were used. Lewis also tells the story is how the new ideas and information was put into use in the Oakland A's organization, which was not initially receptive to those ideas.    So the story is about data and how it can be used, but it is also about how organizations change. The author tells the story from the perspective of the people involved which makes it an interesting and engaging book.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|One of my all time favorites finally out on Dvd. I have watched it a number of times. The music is wonderful. Costumes, acting all great.
0439023483|4.0|I really give this book a 4.5/5<br /><br />I knew NOTHING about this book when I started it.  I'm glad of that, actually, because I think I would have been turned off.  Plus, the editorial reviews on Amazon give a bunch of stuff away.  So don't read those.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the main thrust of the story away.  I will tell you, that I did have a problem with it.  It just wasn't enough to make me put down the book, which was really compelling.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a young adult, futuristic, fantasy, thriller.  There's a post apocalyptic vibe to it, though if there was some kind of apocalypse, its nature is never hinted at.  I kind of hope more of that is elaborated on in the second book of the trilogy.<br /><br />The writing is solid, and never \\"dumbed down\\" for the age of the reader.  It's a dark, disturbing story, with a lot of social commentary.  Collins has created a interesting world.  From the Thriller perspective, it's sort of like a James Rollins book where once it grabs you it rarely lets you go.<br /><br />[...] It could easily be made into a movie, so I could be proven wrong on that.  If you like good YA fantasy, and don't mind the darkness, I recommend it.
1400063515|5.0|This book is the easiest book on the subject of probability I have ever read. It is a delightful read. Yet, much of what Nassim writes is so true, and he reminds us of our fallibility.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Like many people, I excersize in spurts.. on for 2-4 weeks off for 2 month.  I was looking for a workout that I felt I could commit to on a regular basis. I also know myself and my schedule well enough to know that 30 minutes is about the most I will do and a regular basis.  The 30 day shred is perfect!!!  It is a tough workout but you will see results after 1-2 weeks.  I am still on level one and there are days when I am pushed for time, so I only do the first circuit for about 10 minutes but after 2 weeks I have lost 7 pounds and am seeing a difference in my body.  I plan to keep up daily doing the full workout at least 3-4 days a week and the first circuit the other days as I continue to work up to level 2 and 3.  From there I will rotate out the levels.  My point is, if you do not like to excercise but know you should, this is a great DVD.  it is not easy but it is only 22 minutes so you can push through.
B000FIMG68|3.0|I love lost, the writting is good and the casting is great. I liked the character of Eccho introduced this season. In the 3rd disc when hes explaining Baptism to Claire he says Jesus had to be \\"Baptised by John the Baptist to forgive the man's sin\\".This attacks the very core of Christianity as we believe Jesus was sinless, not to mention that the Bible does not say that. If this episode had been done to attack any other religion the outrage would have been endless.

On top of a ridiculous plot, a miscast lead, and a phoned-in Angelina Jolie, I would nominate this film for a Razzie.  Don't say you weren't warned.

1416575464|5.0|As an interior designer and stylist, I have quite a few references books on my shelf. This, however, is my favorite. I've been a fan of Domino magazine since the very first issue and am so sad that it is no longer. This is a great supplement to all of those back issues. You get photos of beautiful rooms as inspiration and all kinds of design tips. There is also a great list or resources at the back of the book. I also really love the size of the book. Even though it has pages and pages of inspiration, I can still fit easily fit it into my tote to bring to a client's house.
0738711500|4.0|THE ARTWOR ON THESE TAROT CARDS IS SUPERB!  \\"Realistic and Haunting\\" best describes them!  CIRO MARCHETTI not only knows how to draw....but some of the faces of people pictured on the cards, (such as the lady in The Ten of Pentacles), are drawn SO realistically as to almost make one believe they are photographs!  Expressions are also very appropriate: if a card represents fear, pride, courage or ambition, and a person is pictured on that card, the face of the person will show the emotion to the reader immediately.    The book accompanying the tarot deck is well-written by JOSEPHINE ELLERSHAW. The paper used is very, very good -- it is extremely white, and I am sure it is non-acidic....so it will last for a very long time!  But the print size is just a bit too small for me -- a point or even a half-point more in type-size would have made it easier for many people to read.  Making the print larger may have added a page or two to the number of pages....but, evrn if using the fine paper which presnently is in the book, a page or two extra could not have added that much extra expense.    However -- unlike many other tarot decks....the booklet accompanying the cards, here, is BIGGER than the deck itself.  This is all to the good, as tinier books mean even tinier print than there is here!    My main disappointment with this deck is that, from the descriptive text used to advertise it, one expected A SUMMARY OF THE MEANING OF EACH CARD TO BE PRINTED ON EACH CARD.  Maybe I misread the publisher's description...but I was extrmely disappointed not to see individual meanings, (or even a few words of summary of meanings) of each card, printed on each card.  For beginners, this would be ideal -- and, despite the overwhelming beauty of the art on the cards, this IS supposed to be a beginner's deck.  The guidebook, of course, goes into much detail about the meanings of each card...but it would be SO much more convenient if a few words, (15 or less?) could be printed somewhere ON each card, so that going to the guidebook would not be necessary, except if the reader wants, not just a cursory definition, but a lengthly explanaition of card meanigns.    Ab accompanying fold-out, \\"The Celtic Spread\\", does give meanings....for where each card is placed.  But this is only one tarot \\"spread\\", and there are many others.  The page gives meanings for the LOCATION of the cards...but for the meaning of the cards themselves, one still must go to the guidbook.  After a while, I'm sure the meaning of each card is impressed on the reader's mind....but for a beginner, printing a quick summary of the meaning of each card, ON each individual card, would really speed up the learning process.    So, other than a slightly-too-small print in the guidebook, and no meanings printed on each card, I have no complaints about this deck.  The artwook is SO beautiful, it takes one's breath away!  The guidebook, though filled with slightly-smallish print, is made of good paper, and good explanations of each card, though one must, perforce, check each meaning in the book, at least to begin with.  These things said, it is an excellent, even a near-perfect deck.  The illustrations are not only realistic, theyare intuitive, and in tune with the meaings of each card.    This set is a beautiful, mysterious, and, I think, quite Powerful set of Tarot cards!
B000Y7U98C|4.0|I have to say Danny Boyle hasn't disappointed me yet. Sunshine from the science-fiction point of view tends to focus more on the science than the fiction and I happen to like that.     My favorite character of the bunch would have to be Chris Evans and his part in the movie seemed the most focused and heroic, but I also liked Corazon, and Cappa.     The twists keep you guessing, and it never kept me from being entertained.     The special effects are superb and don't disappoint in the least, and the scenery alone is breathtaking.    My favorite character of the entire movie would have to be the score. It a mix of stunning surreal and hard hitting music that makes you believe you are actually there with the crew.     All in all, worth the time and money to find it. You won't be disappointed.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|I first heard the cut \\"Bring on the Night\\" on youtube.com and loved it. So I browsed over to Amazon and bought the DVD. Yes. The DVD was produced way back when but it still holds up today as a classic performance. It is a very enjoyable journey that brings together a band exploding with professional talent and how they evolved into a seamless ensemble of rock and jazz. I feel that you can enjoy this work over and over on any Sunday afternoon and find it a worthy buy.
B000001DTM|5.0|I was born in 83... I've heard this album since it came out in 91' when I was 8.  My parents used to play it- I remember hearing it all the way through on family beach trips, I loved it then.  I'm 26 now, about to graduate from Dental School have listened to just about every music genre, and with all the burned cds in my vehicle presently, there is one actual purchased CD- achtung baby.  I still love it, I still listen to it, no album has stood that test of time.    Best review I could write.
0671646788|2.0|If you need advice on how to go from being a self-hating loser to achieving moderate success, then read this book. If, on the other hand, you already have confidence and self respect in your corner, this book has nothing more to offer you. The entire thesis of this book (the power of positive thinking) could have been summarized in a single paragraph.
B000068TP0|3.0|Ten out 11 songs are in Spanish. The only English song exists is called \\"Inevitable\\".    I returned it for a refund. Why is this information not listed on Amazon?    I can't rate this DVD fairly because there's no category for \\"N/A\\". So, I gave it 3 stars.
0679720200|5.0|Camus's The Stranger has often been used as a theme of alienation from society.  I often want to teach it as the opposite.  The themes and ideas are to show the \\"normal\\" human person who finds themselves in deeply emotional events...but they do not show the appropriate emotions at the appropriate period of time.  Is this normal?  We have seen people overreact and act overly emotionally to deaths or other situations for base reasons.  Does that make them normal? We often know people are faking their reactions at funerals and playing a role.  This is normal.  The precips of The Stranger tell us  that acting a role does not make the emotion real.  The protagonist does not bother to act the role that society assigns him and he is JUDGED!  This is the crux of this novel.  I love this novel because it makes me examine humans as individual creatures...we cannot be encapsulated by one defining theme or idea.  Humans are much too confusing and evolving to capture in one defining moment forever.  They will be, as in Camus's novel, judged, but it reflects life...and life changes.  We all do.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|It was a great video but I already loved this movie. I liked some of behind the scenes but I couldn't finish it. It was too boring. I guess they can't all be like Lord of the Rings behind the scenes. I'm glad I got the three disc special though, it was cool to see how they built the Titanic for the movie. I just would have liked to see more of the \\"real Titanic\\" news clippings or true stories.
0060763280|5.0|T. Harv Eker will completely blow your mind about money.    I had no idea how many hang-ups I had about money until I read this.    Powerful, Powerful, Powerful stuff...    I'm speechless.    His slap-in-the-face style of writing really drives the points home.     I can't say it enough. If you want to fix your financial mind... this is THE book to do it.    If this can't help you nothing will.
0307455378|5.0|Zafon es un maestro de la descripcion y un genio de la personificacion. El da vida a los objetos que coexisten en los alrededores del personaje principal, es este caso Martin. El autor es capaz de crear a Martin, que existe como ser humano y que cambia a traves de los sucesos y aventuras que estan a su camino. Si has leido la Sombra del Viento, este libro te va a fascinar ya que toma algunas cosas prestadas como el Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados y la libreria de Sempere e Hijos la cual tiene un parte muy importante en este relato. Para mi Zafon es mas que un escritor, es un artista que crea un mundo visible en mi cabeza, a traves de la escritura.   Creo que una de las cosas menos celebradas en la escritura contemporanea es el final. Muchas veces he visto peliculas o leido textos que son excelentes pero el final es debil. El Juego del Angel tiene un final donde la felicidad y la tristeza son uno. Zafon es capaz de empezar y terminar el libro con fuerza, determinacion y especialmente claridad.  Reir. La interaccion entre Martin y Isabella es muy graciosa. Mientras leo me causa risa ver como este par de personajes de desenvuelven ironicamente conviviendo bajo el mismo techo.   Andreas Corelli y su sonrisa lobuna cuativan la atencion del lector con sus misteriosas apariciones. Puedo decir que Corelli me da escalofrios.  Barcelona. Zafon y su descripcion de Barcelona en las primeras decadas de 1900 traen a la vida a esta ciudad obscura y gotica. Me encanta como Zafon empieza sus capitulos describiendo no solo la ciudad pero el clima; La lluvia, el frio, el lago congelado, la nieve y las nubes negras que traen encuentros inesperados y estrafalarios a Martin.     Este libro lo tiene todo, amor, pasion, aventura, accion, misterio, comedia,terror y sobre todo historias encima de las otras las cuales Martin explora.
B000ZK4466|5.0|Through their first three albums the Mars Volta's career had been somewhat hit-and-miss (though admittedly the hits outnumbered the misses), but with the Bedlam in Goliath they managed to shape their approach into their best album yet.  While displaying their usual ambitious songwriting and instrumental flair they've finally struck the perfect balance between the insanely infectious, groove-laden attack of the their debut \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" and At the Drive-In's Swan Song \\"Relationship of Command,\\" and the spacey progressive leanings that marked \\"Frances the Mute,\\" while reining in the occasional meandering found on \\"Amputechture.\\"  The band's usual hallmarks are all present--inscrutable time signatures, out-of-left-field instrumentation, and spastic shifts in tone and genre, frequently within a single song--and for the first time since their debut they manage to get every track over with in less than ten minutes.  With John Frusciante assisting, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's demented guitar genius is even more evident than usual as they assault listeners with a dizzying, non-stop array of dense metal riffage, screeching feedback, and unrestrained leads.  Thomas Pridgen turns out to be a more-than-satisfactory replacement for Jon Theodore on the drums (just check out his enthusiastic annihilation of his drum kit on Ouroboros), and Cedric Bixler's high-pitched alien wail is as ear-splitting as ever.<br /><br />The opener Aberinkula sets the tone nicely, firing out of the gate with an electrifying salvo of rifle-shot drumbeats and confrontational wails before a hallucinogenic, acid-jazz sax solo begins an extended instrumental passage that seems to bear little resemblance to what preceded it.  The rest of the album follows a similar pattern, with the band managing to indulge their afro-latin-jazz fetishes while simultaneously rocking hard at almost every turn.  Tracks frequently begin with a somewhat conventional (for this band, anyway) rock-song approach--Goliath boasts an especially anthemic chorus, and \\"Cavalettas\\" even gets pretty punkish--before embarking on the sort of free-form, genre-bending explorations for which they've become known.  \\"Soothsayer\\" is a notable exception to the pattern, establishing a haunting, ethereal atmosphere that's abruptly rent apart by an eyebrow-singeing guitar solo that would make Hendrix proud.<br /><br />As with any TMV album, \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\" takes a few listens to absorb (I myself didn't particularly care for it at first), but it eventually coalesces into a richly detailed epic that stands with the best progressive efforts of recent years. From their debut the band established themselves as one of the only outfits out there with a legitimately distinctive sound, and this latest album is no exception.  As usual, those willing to put aside any preconceptions will find themselves amply rewarded.s an especially anthemic chorus, and \\"Cavalettas\\" even gets pretty punkish--before embarking on the sort of free-form, genre-bending explorations for which they've become known.  \\"Soothsayer\\" is a notable exception to the pattern, establishing a haunting, ethereal atmosphere that's abruptly rent apart by an eyebrow-singeing guitar solo that would make Hendrix proud.

B000003NA4|5.0|Diana Krall's CD entitled Love Scenes gives us a beautiful collection of passionate ballads delivered with style, class and sophistication. Diana simply never sounded better; and when people tell you that bassist Christian McBride and guitarist Russell Malone make the music sublime they're certainly telling the truth! Diana's own work on piano enhances \\"How Deep Is The Ocean (How High Is The Sky),\\" too. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is well done.<br /><br />The album starts very strong with Diana Krall performing a wonderful ballad, \\"All Or Nothing At All.\\" \\"All Or Nothing At All\\" features Diana singing this very professionally and her ability to change tempos and keys impresses me quite a bit. Diana's rendition is not the most melodic when you first hear it; but it grew on me every time I heard it and \\"All Or Nothing At All\\" makes a really fine number to begin the album. Listen also for the classic song entitled \\"Peel Me A Grape;\\" \\"Peel Me A Grape\\" has been sung by many chanteuses but Diana's version stands out because of her very fine interpretation of this tune.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\" has a jazzy arrangement but the music still lets Diana stay squarely in the spotlight--awesome! \\"I Don't Know Enough About You\\" is probably my favorite track on this album; although \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is also full of elegance and charm. The music fits in just right with Diana's vocals and \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is a big highlight of this CD. \\"I Don't Stand A Ghost Of A Chance With You\\" again showcases Diana's talent--and that bass playing by Christian McBride enhances this tune even more.<br /><br />\\"You're Getting To Be A Habit With Me\\" is a classic tune that sounds fresh and relentlessly upbeat when Diana tackles it successfully; and I really like \\"How Deep Is The Ocean (How High Is The Sky).\\" \\"How Deep Is The Ocean (How High Is The Sky)\\" has Diana playing a bit with the tempo and keys to make this a most memorable number. Diana's rendition would make Irving Berlin quite proud indeed!<br /><br />\\"My Love Is\\" has a strong jazzy type of arrangement; I love that creative use of percussion! Diana sings this like the songbird she's always been and that's grand. The CD ends strong, too, with Diana Krall performing \\"Garden In The Rain.\\" \\"Garden In The Rain\\" is quite tender and it boasts a type of smooth jazz flavor that works very well for this ballad.<br /><br />Diana Krall's Love Scenes CD is an absolute \\"must-have\\" for her fans; and it also makes a great starter CD for people just discovering the talents of this outstanding chanteuse. People who like classic pop vocals with creative, jazzy twists will also want this in their CD collections.

B000022TSV|5.0|Damn! I bought this years ago when it first came out. Little did I know it would become so expensive. It is a great DVD I only wish my wife appreciated opera as much as I do, I would watch it more often. Migenes is so great in this role!
0634022296|3.0|Has many, many songs with chords in all the right places.  Does not have standard music notation or tabs..  I wish the book was bigger i.e. 8.5x11 and wirebound.  As is, it's hard to place on a music stand and read a page.  The book wants to close.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I can't stand how she yells and screams on tv but this is a really good workout dvd.  It's basic and easily understood.  She doesn't move too fast so you don't feel stupid and inept with the moves.  I tend to do two of the workouts at one time just to go for a longer amount of time.  Overall, while I won't watch the tv show... I'm glad I bought her dvd.
0321344758|5.0|This book was exactly what I needed.  I plan to keep it handy for a reference and will try to implement all the great ideas.
B000NE8D20|5.0|This book makes a perfect gift for a woman -- young or old.  I think it would be great for an intergenerational family read and discussion.  In its beautifully written text it allows the reader to enter into the life of the character Francesca, and it absolves the readers from having to strive for someone else's notion of morality or perfection.      Read it with your daughters when they come of age and think about marriage.  Read it with your girlfriends as it surely reflects life as it is and as we dream it to be.  Read it with your mother for a great conversation starter.  Just read it and enjoy!!!
B001RIY49C|4.0|it probably wont be marked down with it being limited .It will probably go the other way as it becomes harder to get hold of.I cant resist it with being a big T2 fan the skull looks cool.Id much rather have the first and 3rd films inside it along with T2 rather than dvd releases of the same film though.
B000ULV2KG|5.0|Very hard to find import that is perfect for the collector.  Has some very rocking tunes that keep my feet tapping.  Has the very overplayed single \\"Come Out And Play (Keep 'Em Separated)\\" and some other punky rock tunes.  The import is a really nice to my collection of Rock CD's
1592802974|5.0|Market Wizards is fascinating from cover to cover.  I am reading parts of it for the third time.  The wisdom in this book is voluminous.  Now if I would only listen to Market Wizards's lessons when I'm trading...

B001PPLIFU|2.0|I am 42 yrs old movie junkie, but never felt compelled enough to write a review until this one.  Call me dinosaur, or even stupid.  But what is a Bond movie without scoring sexy girls and spectacular finale?  If you want to see Bourne, why would you even bother with this?    If you want something real, go for a documentary.  The fact that ticket sales jump up during recession is a proof that people want to escape the reality.  So where is the fantasy we paid for?
031606792X|5.0|Not sure why people aren't as fond of this one...  At first I wasn't as jazzed about it as it starts off written in Jacob's voice but it does switch back to Bella.    I couldn't stop reading this one just like the other 3.    I won't spoil the book but I think its just as good as the others.
1439102813|5.0|Although I have never had a family member with Alzheimer's, I did have a close neighbor who had the disease and watching the disintegration of his mind was truly heartbreaking.  So much of STILL ALICE is reminiscent of what I saw.      This book does a wonderful job of giving those who have not experienced Alzheimer's a great insight into what the disease does to people.  It certainly helps that Ms. Genova has such amazing credentials and expertise.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about this dreadful disease.
B001CTDH4Y|1.0|One of the worst childrens' movies I have seen.<br />My three-year-old daughter and I went to the theater to watch it because at the time, there was not other kid movie out and we ended up leaving early because neither of us found the movie at all entertaining. The 45 minutes we where there seemed like hours--I was in agony.<br />The jokes are old and overdone and rely on really obvious sterotypes that weren't ever funny. \\"Hold your tacos!\\" It's predictable.<br />My daughter, who loves Wall-E and Kung Fu Panda, even Once, did not like this at all...it was hell to sit through. Hell!
B000002LCK|5.0|new order has been recording since 1981 and this is the fruit of their first six years: a dozen singles!<br /><br />sequenced chronologically, the first disc was originally released as a 2-set vinyl album in 1987.  in 1990, this set was re-released now with a second disc featuring the b-sides of the 12 singles.  also sequenced chronologically, the second disc is also a gem for fans as it featured rarities, spin-off remixes and dub versions!<br /><br />all the tracks in disc one are highlights. for disc two, you get to appreciate confused instrumental (confusion), the beach (blue monday dub), thieves like us (instrumental), kiss of death (the perfect kiss in different mix), and shame of the nation (probably state of the nation's original remix) plus 1963.<br /><br />this is a wonderful collection to complement your new order's \\"singles\\" and other new order collectibles!
B001JNND9W|4.0|I bought this movie after hearing that it was filmed in Goldfield, NV. It was so cool to see the town and what it looked like almost 40 years ago. It used to be the largest town in Nevada boasting 300,000 people a hundred years ago. The Goldfield Hotel in which Super Soul broadcasted his radio show has been featured on Fox Scariest Places on Earth, Ghost Hunters, and Ghost Adventures. As for the movie itself, it kind of seems a bit dated. Nice naked chick on the motorcycle however and cool car crashes.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|...that is, everyone who wanted to bag on this record based on silly arguments like \\"Is It Floyd?\\" or \\"Is Roger Waters a jerk?\\", or \\"Are these outtakes of The Wall?\\". Anything along these lines when describing this antiwar spasm of emotion and bitterness obviously doesn't understand the content, or is lacking empathy so intensely that I wonder if any of these people are half-human.     You will not get this type of depth and richness of lyric in any modern record. I am not interested in arguing about the sparseness of the music; it matches perfectly with the desperation of its protagonists. Pink Floyd has been deftly articulating the facility of our modern social experiences since 1973, and I have absolutely no idea why this album doesn't fit into that mold for some people. Yes, it does not \\"rock\\", yes, it is a mile away from what you are accustomed to from Pink Floyd, big deal. A good album is a good album; be it Floyd or be it Waters.     The internecine warfare between the musicians is utterly irrelevant, and if you don't like the White Album, Pet Sounds, Big Star's Radio City, The Byrds' Notorious Byrd Brothers, Black Sabbath's Sabotage, or The Velvet Underground's Loaded for this reason, then you are a drone, a rock and roll moron that doesn't grasp the concept that strain, tenseness and destruction are among art's most vibrant drivers.
076535618X|4.0|I have read the \\"Old Man's War\\" 'trilogy' and think that Scalzi has brought great and new ideas to scifi.  I bought one book and quickly had to buy the others to see what new things were in store.  Though you don't have to read the preceding 2 books before The Last Colony it would help to understand the.. universe Scalzi has created.  I would say that this is a scifi that most could read, even if they didn't necessarily like scifi's.  There is more than just action and space travel, which is pretty cool, but it delves into fresh scientific ideas, philosophies, love, and finding priorities.  I would also like to add that Scalzi's books have a military appeal I suppose, in that they are much more strategically and tactically realistic than many scifi's I've known of.  I would have liked to have read more on the 'werewolves' in this book, but I suppose that allows for one's imagination to unfold as it wants.  Anyways, great scifi and all around great read.
0385340990|5.0|Our book club loved this book! The authors' voice (two authors - same voice - amazing)was intelligent, and witty. We learned quite a bit of WWII Guernsey history as we fell in love with the quirky characters whose loyalty and generosity were inspiring. So satisfying!
0061649694|5.0|I thought this book has fantastic, it was engaging to read and the story line kept changing i thought there were a few parts that were a lil creepy like them the characters begin \\"melting\\", i believe it was a result of a few personal nightmares i had while reading the book..lol..however i was not so impressed with the movie.. This book was recommended to me by one of my students and i was quite surprised how much i liked it. i was even more surprised to learn Neil Gaiman the author also write stardust which was a fantastic movie.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|This past awards season left a bad taste in my mouth, when every honor went to \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" as the year's best. Don't get me wrong its a good film, that is very enjoyable. But it is just a good film not a great one, and it became very overrated like last year's \\"Juno\\". I understand why people love this film so much, it's a feel good movie about rooting for the underdog to succeed and be with his true love. It's not a bad film, it's just if you are going to reward films based on excellence. Then I think their were certainly better films then \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\".
0060916540|5.0|Gripping reality......never have I read anything that is such a true tale of seizing whatever energy and means you have to work with ....and choosing to keep going...no matter what....to survive........brilliant.
B001RIY49C|5.0|The packaging looks great.  Terminator 2: Judgment Day is as close to a perfect sci-fi adventure as you can get and is easily the best in the series thus far.  For these two reasons, I give this product 5-Stars.  Unfortunately, the price tag for this collection is grossly out of proportion to the age of the film, and the fact America is in a recession.  No single film, despite cool packaging, is worth over $50.00.  Period.  My advice is to hold off buying this blu-ray edition of T2 until retailers mark it down considerably.
B00005MP58|5.0|This series is simply amazing. It is witty, well acted, and completely keeps your interest over the many, many hours. Mr. Collins is repulsive, just as he should be. Oh, and Colin Firth is simply wonderful as Mr. Darcy.    If you like period pieces, buy this series. I own it and have watched it many, many times and I never fail to enjoy it!
B00000JLWW|5.0|What more is there to say? Everyone knows the story. Heart wenching, beautiful to look at, great acting-'nuf said?
B001LRJH0U|3.0|I own a rather large collection of Robert B. Parker books (I'm a lot more \\"mystery\\" than \\"western\\".) so when APPALOOSA came out I got it from the library.  It was so good, I went ahead and bought it and it's sequel, RESOLUTION.  Then the movie came out starring two of my favorite actors, Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. Couldn't wait to see it, even though I knew the book would color my perception of the film's characters.<br /><br />I didn't care at all for Harris' portrayal of Virgil Cole, who became almost giddy upon meeting Mrs. French (played impecably by Renee Zellweger). For all his rules and regulations, Virgil is a stone killer and judging from reading the two books, Cole simply doesn't ever get freakin' giddy.  His slavish devotion to a woman who proves repeatedly to be unfaithful is odd, but that at least is consistant with the book. Harris' reactions at certain times were off the mark if one goes strictly by the character created by Mr. Parker.<br /><br />Mortensen did an understated side-kick role, but did so ably. Zellweger completely surprised me with her total immersion into the Ali French character and did so beautifully. She was perfect in the role. I don't believe anyone could have done it better.<br /><br />I've enjoyed Mr. Parker's books for years and probably will continue to do so years. His Jesse Stones series were successfully transferred to film starring Tom Selleck and seems to be doing well. For some reason, though, the dialogue in APPALOOSA did not transfer quite so well to the big screen.  The characters, with the exception of Mrs. French, never really developed beyond two dimensional. Even the inclusion of veteran actor Lance Hendriksen as gunman Ring Sheldon did nothing to help.<br /><br />This isn't a great movie, but for those who love westerns it is certainly worth borrowing or renting.
B001K98MFU|5.0|I loved the DVD, but it PALES in comparison to the Blu-Ray edition.  The Bandai English dub track is superb.  The Manga UK track, while the same voice actors, adds a different emotional feel to the story.  I haven't heard the Japanese track yet since we had that in the DVD.  The sound in any case is stupendous.  It must be watched and listened to on a 6.1 or more system to get what I mean.  Visually?  Gorgeous.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is a treat.
0307346617|4.0|I know what your thinking, zombies , seriously zombies???<br /><br />Max Brooks did an outstanding job on this book!<br /><br />I picked this book up at the bookstore because of the title \\"World War Z\\", once I realized that meant World War Zombie, I threw it down. Next trip to the bookstore, this time I read the back of the book, read all the rave reviews there and inside. Still not fullly convinced, I flipped through it, I liked the format Mr. Brooks used and decided to give it a try.<br /><br />This book is a fun read! It's a WHAT IF ? book, what if zombies were attacking the world and killing everyone or it could be a massive worldwide plague that is making people sick enough to kill?? Any worldwide event, something big enough to affect everyone, what would you do, how would we all survive??<br /><br />The book is an oral history of World War Z, A narrator goes back and interviews people about their roles in the war. What they saw as it happened, what they thought when they first heard about it, how they survived. The interviews are conducted worldwide.<br /><br />The book is very, very creative. It took me awhile to read, but it was worth it.<br /><br />Max Brooks is a good story teller and will definitely keep your attention in this book!
B001NY42KQ|5.0|Packed with jump out of your seat and dance music, the High School Musical series is something I think everyone could enjoy. I saw the third film before seeing the earlier two and I think it is the best one of them all! My favorite scenes include \\"A Night to Remember\\" and \\"The Boys are Back\\" but every scene with the Wildcats draws you in.    If you like feel good music that is insanely catchy and watching extremely cute and talented actors on screen (Zac Efron and Corbin Bleu) then I think you would really enjoy HSM3: Senior Year.     Like Hugh Jackman said at the Oscars last week, \\"The Musical is Back!\\" And I for one could not be happier!!
B001O2MBMI|3.0|I don't know why a lot of CDs of British artists are always released later in the United States, but obviously this deluxe edition of Leona Lewis' Spirit is released late for a reason.    For the DVD, the US version contains one more music video \\"Run\\" and a live performance of \\"I Will Be\\" that are not included in the international version, for the release of the international version is earlier than that of the \\"Run\\" video. Nevertheless, \\"The Making of the Video Forgive Me\\" is not available in the US version, but as this is a music product, I guess more music videos are better.    For the CD, they used the original revised US track list for the standard part, but they changed \\"Better in  Time\\" and \\"Footprints in the Sand\\" into single mixes. Both of the single mixes are quite different from the album versions. For example, in \\"Better in Time\\", the piano intro was extended, and the main melody only came in for the chorus, while in the album version, the main melody came in as soon as Lewis started to sing. The difference of the versions of \\"Footprints in the Sand\\" is even more evident. Among the four bonus tracks, three of them are unique compared with the international version. \\"Myself\\", which is a duet between Lewis and Novel, is exclusive in this US release; \\"Run\\", which is an album version in the international release, is also a single mix in the US release; \\"Bleeding Love (Remix)\\", which is originally an iTune bonus track for the first US edition, is finally available as a shorter version on physical CDs.    Deluxe Editions of CDs are always about making money, but this CD has six different tracks compared with the original US release, besides it came with a DVD. In addition, as I'm a buyer from China, who's now studying in the US, my copy of the first edition is the international version, which means it does not even have \\"Misses Glass\\" and the single \\"Forgive Me\\". Therefore, if you like Leona Lewis, buying this new edition is not so bad a choice.
B000YAA68C|1.0|If you plan on reading the book or you have read the book DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE! I loved the book and read it in less than a week but when I watch this movie I almost turned it off. I was sooo disappointed in how far away from the real story that this movie went. You may like it if you don't ever intend to read the book.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|This is the movie + special features and upcoming BD Live stuff. Fans like me will love that the visuals are improved from DVD. I don't have a fancy soundsystem so I cannot personally comment on its upgrade on BD. Accessing the special features in-movie is great and a part of the format so owning this title on BD is a worthy upgrade for those BrownCoats out there!     If you are watching this title for your first time, the BD version is a must if you have the choice. I was hooked on the Firefly 'Verse from this movie and I plan on upgrading my Firefly collection to BD this year.     Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed!
B001IZIDHI|5.0|I don't think there's anything new I can add to this review that people don't already know. It is an amazing album filled with TONS of amazingly written songs. Usually a CD album these days have about 20-30% hit songs in them, but \\"Spirit\\", in my personal opinion, has about 70%+ hit songs that I can just listen to over and over again. All of the songs are very unique and are like a treasure on their own. THAT with Leona's incredible vocal - just blows my mind. She is really good on expressing emotions through her voice and I believe she will definitely touch your heart.<br /><br />The additional \\"Run\\" is a very beautiful song. I love the original Snow Patrol version, but Leona definitely makes it her own. It is a very emotional song with a message that will surely \\"light\\" you up. I think it's worth the money to buy the Deluxe version JUST for this song alone.<br /><br />I don't think words can explain how amazing Leona Lewis is. You HAVE to listen to her to understand. If you haven't bought her CD already, BUY THIS ONE! The bonus track \\"Run\\" will be worth it! If you don't believe me, go to YouTube and watch her live performance singing \\"Run\\" at the X Factor and I assure you, you will fall in love with her.<br /><br />My personal favorite tracks: Bleeding Love, I Will Be, Here I Am, Footprints in the Sand, A Moment Like This, Run

B000EQ5SR0|5.0|This movie is an excellent adaptation of the original animated series.  What makes this such a great movie is the fact that although it is based in the original anime, it has a more solid plot and storyline.  Charlize Theron makes a very believable performance, as well as the rest of the characters, and the plot of the story will have science fiction fans whooping.  Excellent movie!

B001KL3GY0|4.0|As a long time Franz Ferdinand fan, I have to say this new CD is very VERY different from what I've come to know as \\"Franz Ferdinand\\" and it took me a minute to get my bearings as it were after the first listen, but it's an enjoyable CD and there are several danceable tracks, but I'm still personally on the fence about it.

B000001FI7|5.0|Portishead's debut, \\"Dummy\\" is a hauntingly beautiful CD that captures the essence of trip hop with its slow and simple but insistent drum beats, moody atmospheric music samples, angst-laden lyrics, and sweet sounding though emotionally detached vocals.  Essential listening for anybody who likes this genre of music.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz somehow just keeps getting better and better... his voice, his creations, spirit, concerts, everything.  This album has a little of everything on it. Everytime I put it on it's like the first time I heard it-- I get so energized and can't believe anyone could create such beauty and genius-level music. That's my best at putting \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" into words... you just have to experience it yourself.  Also the EP versions of these songs are amazing... some of them I enjoy more than the album versions. Cheers!
6305971935|4.0|Not much has ever been noted about research done by New Zealand native and former pilot Bruce Cathie that strongly substantiated the feasibility of what was referred to as both 'Project Invisibility' and, later, 'The Phoenix Project/Project Rainbow'. Cathie, in his eye-opening book Harmonic 695, demonstrated that Einstein had actually COMPLETED his Unified Field Theory and that there was an unmistakable mathematical factor in successful atomic tests also correlating with UFO sightings - so much so that his life has treaded a very, very fine line that neither fellow UFO researcher Dr. Morris K. Jessup (appeared to have committed suicide, but the evidence points to murder) and likely even Nikola Tesla, whose death was in fact under equally mysterious circumstances (it's said by some involved with the project that he was killed for having knowledge of Einstein's reticence concerning application of the UFT and, recognizing just how dangerous the experiment truly was, sabotaged the earliest trials) apparently could walk.    In David Hatcher Childress' equally eye-opening book, Anti-Gravity and the Earth Grid, Cathie reviews legendary researcher Ivan T. Sanderson's 'Vile Vortices' as well as geodesic mapping by Buckminster Fuller and the Russians, going on to mathematically prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is a corresponding grid line running exactly between Philadelphia and the Norfolk/Newport News area which would have directly facilitated the event; by virtue of Tesla's groundbreaking work with interference fields and variable pulsed electrical current, the Eldridge and its crew could indeed have been teleported from Philly to Norfolk and back again as purported. As a last note, I can tell you that my own belief this experiment actually occurred was greatly reinforced by a chance conversation with a fellow co-worker some years ago whose father had worked closely with quantum physicist (his wave and matrix mechanics tenets directly related to Tesla's postulations) and master mathematician John Von Neumann (upon whom the movie's Longstreet character is more or less based). He told her of Von Neumann's extensive work on the Philadelphia Experiment.....
0192853619|5.0|I'm generally in agreement with the other 5-star reviews of this book.<br /><br />There are many possible ways to write a \\"very short introduction to mathematics,\\" and Gowers has chosen to give an introduction to the kind of work professional mathematicians do: the problems they try to solve, the methods they use, the difficulties they encounter, the kinds of results they obtain, the joys they experience, how the profession as a whole progresses, how mathematics relates to other subjects (eg, physics), etc.<br /><br />Gowers does this by giving us an expert tour of a wide variety of topics -- certainly not a survey of all of higher mathematics (see [[ASIN:0691118809 The Princeton Companion to Mathematics]] for that), but still a nice diverse sampling.  Some of the topics are fairly challenging, but others are more basic, so I think there's something here for everyone.  The discussions of each topic are relatively brief and aren't meant to provide a thorough textbook-level treatment, but there's enough depth to convey the key ideas effectively.<br /><br />As a Fields Medalist, Gowers clearly has a command of the mathematics himself, yet he also clearly understands the limitations and interests of the reader, so he serves as an excellent and sympathetic teacher and his resulting writing is remarkably lucid.<br /><br />The only prerequisites for the book are comfort with high-school mathematics, curiosity about the nature of higher mathematics, and willingness to pay attention and do some thinking.  For readers so equipped, this is a delightful book which I highly recommend.
0385340540|3.0|The more I read John Grisham's latest efforts in the legal thriller genre, the more convinced I become that he's lost interest in writing that type of book, but something has to keep the money coming in and that's what he's best known for, so he produces these offerings that come off as very half-hearted.<br /><br />As Grisham novels go, I would rate this one above \\"The Associate\\" but nowhere even close to other (much earlier) favorites like \\"The Client\\". \\"The Broker\\" is a fairly interesting and entertaining read, but it bogs down -- WAY down -- in the middle due to the endless descriptions of Bologna and its statues, fountains, colonnades, towers, winding streets, statues, fountains, colonnades, towers, winding streets, statues, fountains, colonna.....well, you get the picture.<br /><br />In his notes at the end of the book, John confides that he \\"adores\\" Italy and all things Italian and \\"adores\\" Bologna (yes, he used the word \\"adore\\" twice in one paragraph) and yes, John, we understand that you do. But it all seemed much more appropriate to engage in lengthy descriptions of cities, food and cultures in, say, \\"Playing for Pizza,\\" which was not, as you recall, a legal thriller.<br /><br />This was not a terrible book, however, and if you can make it past Bologna, it will hold your interest until the rather abrupt ending. If you're a longtime Grisham fan, it would be best to approach this book knowing that it will not have the wildfire pace of his earlier novels that scorched the eyebrows right off your face.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|After seeing the great reviews for this and watching a chilling trailer...I knew I had to go out and see it. I was absolutely blown away by it. EVERYTHING about this film is amazing..It is simply beautiful. The performances, the story, the cinematography, the scenery. EVERYTHING. Seeing this after Twilight makes me wonder why Twilight deserves all of this big buzz. This should be out in every theatre and causing headlines. It should be Perez Hilton's number one story! My god please go out and see this..and the book is great as well. You will NOT be disappointed.
B00136NXGI|5.0|This album is a must have, must listen for any music lover.  It lets the listener explore Dylan's poetry and musical ability.  The lyrics are magical and extend far beyond song writers of today.  Sit back in a dim room with a glass of your favorite beverage and listen from start to finish.  You will be inspired.
B00028U6B8|5.0|Well, Spencer's gone, we're all getting on, the present gets crappy and scary, and the 60's just get more mythical as we go.  So when do we realize this band and their cronies were the Cassandras of their time? (Google her).    The music is epic and anthemic, even the quiet songs like \\"Good Shepherd\\" and \\"Turn My Life Down\\" have an urgency to them that asks the listener to think about the choices and compromises they have made, the lifestyles they have chosen.    I gave this album a good headphone listen tonight, and I'm convinced the reason this band has become so obscure and forgotten is because they spoke an uncomfortable truth to comfort.  They were not about entertainment, but rather whatever entertainment's opposite is.    This album is not just a collection of erudite, well written and really well played songs, but a statement about America (as it was then) that has become horribly and prophetically realized 40 years later.   If Baxters was anti-commercial, Volunteers was anti-everything our dopey leaders thought was good for us, and (more importantly) them.   What is the last time music actually made any kind of political statement about the status quo, the way this album did?  U-2, maybe, but every other pop artist these days is all about the mo-ney. No musician today will let you hear a discouraging word about the way things are, so listen to the increasingly ancient sounds of the Airplane to understand where politics briefly met art and music. Good luck on your 401K, motherf$#*er!
1400082773|1.0|I loved \\"The Audacity of Hope\\".  When Obama was elected, I was delighted.  I was so disappointed in this book.  I was disappointed in the bad language coming from the mouth of our President.  I listened to the book on audio and had to stop.  I know it's the \\"real world\\", but I might be a Republican now.
B000BNTM96|5.0|Simply put, If you like QOTSA at all, BUY THIS DVD/CD Set!  I Pre-Ordered this when it came out only expecting the Live Audio Recording and to My surprise found the DVD video of the performance (which includes Multiple songs Not on the Audio CD and Plenty of Rare and Bonus treats).    AWESOME, repeat, AWESOME live versions of QOTSA Classics you know and love (Or will after this).  Especially the versions of \\"..Make It Wit Chu\\", \\"..Lost My Headache\\", \\"Song for the Deaf\\", \\"No One Knows\\", \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\".  Its all you could ever hope for out of a live performance of one of your favorite bands. It's almost like an ENCORE PERFORMANCE all the way through.  I've described it to friends as a sort of \\"Greatest Hits\\" pre-Era Vulgaris.  It truly lives up to the title \\"Over the Years and Through the Woods.  If you ever needed to convey to some one why you like QOSTA you could literally hand them this Album and they would get the point.    Needless to say, this is ONE of my indispensable CD's that I'll be playing the rest of my life.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I notice mostly 5 star reviews.  Anyone giving this show  low reviews would have to be brain dead.  Fantastic television entertainment ( I watch it on dvd, not tv programming), wonderful  casting, subtle, intelligent grasp of psychology and nuance,  jam packed with story line!  O so much more than the original  trailers and advertisements portrayed, glad I am embroiled in it !
0679735259|4.0|The book takes us into the front lines - reads like Hunter S. Thompson's reporting. Could have been titled Fear and Loathing in S.E. Asia.If you like \\"Gonzo\\" journalism, you'll love Herr's book!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|As a child of the 80s I grew up with a combination of truly awful and truly amazing music.  HITS, released in 1998, falls into the latter category, and includes many of my favourite Phil Collins songs from Mum & Dad's vinyl collection.  I especially love the moment, 3 minutes and 40 seconds into \\"In The Air Tonight\\" when Phil really starts to pound those drums.  I'm not sure if it has something to do with sharing my birthday with another famous drummer (Ringo Starr) or because the song is featured on a Cadbury commercial with an ape in Phil's place, but either way, WOW.  I love it!!    Is it worth buying?!  If you already love Genesis and/or Phil Collins, that would be an enthusiastic HELL YES!!  If you were born in the 90s and have no idea who Phil is other than his portions of Disney's Tarzan soundtrack, then perhaps you'd be better off going to iTunes and listening to the track samples BEFORE charging it your parents credit card.

1594201927|2.0|The book starts well, then slips into off-topic subjects, including the author's well-worn economists' dogma opinions about government spending and social welfare (think Milton Friedman light).  There is ultimately a lack of depth on the supposed subject -- 'money.'      One comes away with the impression of an author who spreads himself too thin (as many self-promoting academics seem to do), and invested too little time, effort, and focus doing the heavy lifting needed to treat the subject in the way it could/should be.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|So I have been reading the reviews, why is it that people feel the need to complain so much and what's worst is that they complain about stuff that does not make sence. Take for example the guy who said this movie was \\"outdated\\" and that it moves slow... when do you THINK this movie was made? it's nobodies fault that you are used to fast paced films with little plot, but the rest of us like a little more to our movies. This movie is amazing and it has a ton to offer, timeless and priceless.

Are we supposed to believe that he changed them?  And why is it set in modern times(the 2000's)?  IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE HIS FIRST MISSION, REMEMBER?

B000002OCP|4.0|This Muddy Waters disc was released in 1968, which should tell you a lot about it.  Marshall Chess wanted to create a concept album that would hit big with the hippy rockers, people listening to Hendrix and Cream and the like.  And it was a big seller, but not critically acclaimed.  In short, this disc is not Muddy Waters' finest.  In fact, from what I can tell, he barely even plays guitar on this album.  Pete Cosey plays some great funky wah-wah guitar.  Most of the songs are classic Muddy tunes, and even a Rolling Stones cover thrown in for good measure.  Muddy sings well, though it doesn't quite mesh ideally with the busy guitar.  It's definitely geared more toward the rock crowd; by no means is it a pure blues album.  But for those of you into Jimi, Cream, Zeppelin and the like who also dig blues music and rockin' blues, this is a fun disc to pick up and listen to.  Just don't let it be the definitive Muddy Waters cd in your collection.

We're going on a bear hunt  We're going to catch a big one  What a beautiful day  We're not scared    If you don't mind this paragraph over and over again, perhaps you'll enjoy the book.    I also don't understand why only every other page is in color.  This inconsistency really bothers me (although I don't think my daughter cares).  What's the purpose of this...am I missing something?      The sound effects you get to make are fun and that is the only redeeming value of this book in my eyes.    Granted, we don't know the song so perhaps that helps.
B0000258CK|5.0|I would give this masterpiece 6 stars if I could . She is a musical icon in every way, shape and form. She is timeless in her voice, her songs and casts her spell as so few performers can. God bless you Carole King, for sharing your beauty and talents with us all.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|Though this film was given mixed reviews by critics, I for one really enjoyed it.  Jackman is charming and hot as always and he has great chemistry with Kidman.  The film itself is beautiful to look at, the cinematography is supurb.  I appreciated that though a serious film, it could be lighthearted at times and quite funny.  It is long, yes, but it's an epic, so you should not be surprised by the length, I really never felt myself looking at my watch.  If you have any interest in the early history of Australia or just appreciate the work of Jackman or Kidman, then I cant imagine you not enjoying this epic ride into the land of Oz.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Stevens' bold plan to concoct an album of songs inspired by each of the 50 U.S. states might be unattainable, but \\"Illinois,\\" the second installment in the series, is strong enough to represent the border regions of Indiana and Iowa, too. Airy vocals, exquisite orchestration, eclectic instrumentation and the unlikely pairing of schizophrenic arrangements with catchy hooks helped to make it the top-rated 2005 release on online review aggregator MetaCritic. The sparse accordion, banjo and electric guitar ode to Decatur is one of my favorites.
B001JNNDAQ|5.0|REVISED FOR NEW 2012 BEST BUY \\"SIGNATURE COLLECTION\\" SINGLE DISC RELEASE OF \\"THE FRENCH CONNECTION\\"<br /><br />The 2011 remaster \\"Signature Collection\\" DVD features a brand new transfer that hews closer to the original look of the film and was supervised by Cinematopgraher Owen Reizman with William Friedkin. The colors no longer bleed like they did with the oversatured (and, alternatively, sometimes monochromatic)transfer that Friedkin supervised for release in 2008.<br /><br />The way to tell the difference between the 2008 and 2012 reissue is 1) the cover for the reissue features a close shot of Gene Hackman (and it states \\"Director's Signature Series\\" below Hackman's face)and it is a single disc release ommiting the 2nd disc (all of the extras are on the first disc with the exception of the BBC Documentary \\"The Poughskeepie Shuffle\\" and (naturally) the featurette on the new coloring timing.<br /><br />Colors are quite nice here--far more natural and not as oversaturated as the Friedkin release and reflect what a pristine new restored print would look like. The transfer is clean of dirt, debris, etc. and although the image quality is soft at times, part of that has to do with the shooting choices, age of the film, etc. Skin textures, tones and detail look remarkably sharp considering the age of the film.<br /><br />Audio features the same 5.1 HD DTS transfer as the previous Blu-ray, an English Surround, original mono, Spanish and French 5.1 mixes.<br /><br />I'm not sure at this stage if Fox is offering an exchange for fans who purchsed the 2008 Friedkin version with color timing changes for the single disc 2012. I've put an email question on this but have not heard back as of yet but will update this review if it turns out that they WILL offer it.<br /><br />We also get a booklet that discusses the making of the movie and the actors.<br /><br />I'd recommend the remaster although I would have liked to see Fox include the BBC documentary as well.<br /><br />ORIGINAL 2008 REVIEW BELOW:<br /><br />Folks that have the DVD version of \\"The French Connection\\" may want to hold on to it since director Friedkin went back and altered the look of his film--some folks will like it some will not.<br /><br />The film certainly deserves five stars the transfer here three with the altered color timing three as Friedkin messes with the look of a classic movie that didn't need it.<br /><br />William Friedkin's Academy Award winning \\"The French Connection\\" altered the rules for the police drama. He eschewed the procedural approach of many films instead going for a gritty, raw documentary look for the film. First up--this is a film that is over 30 years old so its not going to look like a more contemporary film with a slick veneer to the transfer. Friedkin went back and personally supervised the transfer going for a more washed out look to the colors as well coming as close to a noir film as possible for a color film. That's good news and bad for fans; it's never quite looked like this before but, according to the introduction by Friedkin, this is really how he had intended for it to look from the beginning. So if you have your original DVD and love the look of the film there you probably won't like the look of the film here on Blu-ray. Ideally, Friedkin and Fox should have released the film resembling its original theatrical version and his new one together so fans could watch which ever one they preferred. This 2008 remaster looks almost colorized at times with colors deliberately oversatured or bleeding.<br /><br />I should note that those people raised on Michael Bay action films will probably find some of the film slow going. Friedkin's film is from a time when directors didn't feel the need to cut films for an audience with media induced ADD. Friedkin recognized that the drama in addition to the editing would pull people in and that rapid editing where appropriate was perfect but if it was inappropriate it would detract from the performances.<br /><br />Fox ports over all of the extras from the deluxe two disc edition(including \\"The Pougkeepsie Shuffle\\", commentary tracks, the isolated score, deleted scenes)and adds some exceptional extras.

B000065IOG|5.0|Though described as an \\"electronica collective\\" by some, it's BV3's genre-bending crossover tracks like the loungey, trip hop, art-pop \\"Drinking in L.A.\\" that light my ears. Clearly those quick to label focused more on robotic specimens like \\"Oblonging\\" while ignoring almost completely naked folky tracks like \\"Mamma Don't Smoke\\" with its appropriately Big Lebowski-ish refrain \\"I'm more laid back than you'll ever be.\\" Is it a coincidence that both 'the Dude' and Glee (BV3's debut) first graced our eyes and ears in 1998? Listen to the album for more Coen brothers conspiracy connections.
0307388840|4.0|Atonement is a beautifully written novel that operates on many levels.  First and foremost it does NOT operate well as an action novel.  The action is very slow and staged.  If you like a good action-packed book, this one is not for you.  However, if you like a nuanced novel with psychological insights and intrigue, you will probably really appreciate Atonement.  It is written in four very different and distinct styles which depend on the narrator and time period portrayed.  Sometimes the descriptive passages get a bit overwrought, especially in the first (and longest) section, which is written in the words of a precocious teen aged girl.  These passages make the first part drag a bit, but they are not intolerable.

We also agree that storyboarding is a vital way to organize thoughts and turn them into stories (\\"If you take the time in this part of the preparation stage and set your ideas up in a logical fashion in storyboard format, you can visualize the sequential movement of your content narrative and the overall flow and `feel' of the presentation\\").      The \\"General Design Principles\\" section is also useful though I suspect the visual examples are far beyond the skills of most PowerPoint users (myself included).
015206396X|3.0|The book started off slowly but I found it very captivating and the plot original. In the middle I found myself not being able to put the book down, the beginning and end were so-so, thats why I rate it 3 stars. (If I could rate it 3 1/2, I would).  I probably will not read the pre-sequel \\"Fire\\", but Bitterblue's novel seems like a very interesting read and the relationship and love story between Po and Katsa was very well written, so I cant wait to they are up to!
B000F7CMQ8|3.0|I stumbled across Mogamabo at the library before I got a chance to see Red Dust, which I had heard was excellent. The cover art riveted me, and I looked forward to seeing Ava Gardner as the smoldering temptress. Unfortunately, Gardner's character came across as sniveling and whiney. She appears to be immediately attracted to Clark Gable's character, but when he doesn't return her interest she becomes pouty and sullen. At least twice she ran away to cry, which would have been more understandable if she and Gable's character had ever communicated interest. I just wanted to shake her and say, \\"You're a beautiful woman. Tons of men would want you. Move on!\\" Her catty comments and continual attempts to get attention made her character reek of desperation and was quite unbecoming. She was not the strong female character that I am used to seeing in other classic movies. On top of that, I finally saw Red Dust, and there is just no comparison. Gardner does not hold a candle to Jean Harlow in this movie.     Then there is Grace Kelly's character. She is plain, and her waffling is annoying. She is just... boring. She even looked boring. In her other movies, I've found her quite beautiful, but in this movie she looked a little washed-out. Overall, I couldn't really tell why Gable's character would want either of these women.     On a more positive note, I enjoyed Gable's performance. It was interesting to compare to his earlier work in Red Dust. He had a youthful attractiveness in Red Dust that made it easy to see how he would be able to win over the women, and in Mogambo he seems to bring a sense of maturity to the role that changes the tone somewhat. Both performances were good. Additionally, the African scenery was beautiful.     All in all, I would recommend seeing Red Dust above Mogambo, but this is not the review of a Red Dust fanatic poo-pooing the remake; these were the impressions I had before seeing Red Dust, and seeing that movie only confirmed it. Mogambo is alright, but don't expect the best performances from Gardner and Kelly.
B000AMPZF8|4.0|With one of the most unabashedly potent 1-(especially)2-3 opening punches of alternative pop-rock in recent decades, this take-no-prisoners trio of a haunted melodic momentum is hard pressed to follow the entire album up with that kind of startling starting energy. There continues to be plenty of strong moments throughout, but the trail-off is evident and especially damaging when the band goes into their faux-RATM aggro-mode.

0452286751|4.0|Various things are exaggerated in the book, but yet it manages to articulate those inarticulate views on e.g. individualism and collectivism that I've had for many years and was sometimes critized for. This is one the reasons why I found the book to be worthwhile. Roark is also inspiring, and the plot is intriguing.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|The film that proves that Clint Eastwood has the range and abilities of any of the greats of Hollywood. If you didn't know better, you might dismiss this film as a light romance.  In fact it is as heartfelt a look at romance, human lovingkindness and mortality as anything from Hardy or Pasternak.  Truly magnificent performances.  As near flawless a film as you will ever find.
0385340990|4.0|The information about the occupation by the German troops was well presented.  The characters were also very easy to flesh out and were lovable.<br /><br />The format of being presented via letters with alernating authors and adresses was curious.  At first a challenge to follow - but by the third letter was inconsequential.<br /><br />Would be GREAT for a bookclub selection.
B00140PK6O|5.0|No need to restate the plot, others have done it before this review. I have a large collection of BBC period/historical DVDs and after passing over this title several times, I recieved it for Christmas. This is a story written and produced by women about women and the loving touch is evident everywhere. I especially enjoyed seeing Simon Woods (you'll recognize him from Pride and Prejudice, 2005 as Mr. Bingley) and Imelda Stanton (Dolores Umbridge, Harry Potter and O of P) sans pink suite. And of course, there's Judi Dench. She's just wonderful as the younger sister: Touching, sad, lively and ever hopeful. I wonder if Dame Judi  needs an extra granddaughter? I'd like to be invited over for tea sometime.     Anyway, make yourself a nice cup of tea (not the green stuff, it's bad for your liver and you'll find out who thinks so), make some time for yourself and watch this beautiful and loving and funny story about the Ladies of Cranford. In addition and just in case you haven't already discovered this gem. Please check out \\"Ladies in Lavender\\", with Judi Dench and Maggie Smith.

B000000XB9|5.0|gave this CD 5 stars because after being indoctrinated on this stuff -- sometimes you just need a nostalgic buzz.... No wonder there's still residual money to be made and fought over with these ones....classic CCR remastered and sounding better now then when originally released.
B00008977N|5.0|This is my first Peter Gabriel DVD, and I'm going to buy more because of it.  Gabriel is a natural genius in his genre, and emotion exudes from his songs as they lull you effortlessly into them.  The musicians who accompany him are top notch to put it mildly, and the female backup singer is fantastic (although I had to look past her combat boots she wore with a beautiful senuous black dress).  Her vocals were excellent however.  I didn't care too much about the choice of visuals Gabriel used during the concert, but that is not an important issue with me as it's the music that counts.  In summary, the DVD is well worth the price.
B001NOMNZW|4.0|I have loved disney films since I was about four years old and I still do. They're cheesy, but they're always entertaining. I think Highschool Musical 3 is a really well made film with great music, some good acting, and it's just a good time for the whole family. Some of the actors in the film aren't that great, they're way too cheesy for me to find them believable, but Ashley Tisdale is actually pretty decent at being the snobby diva and Zach Efron is actually a good stage performer. Other than that, most of the cast is slightly forgettable. Good movie and good musical. I have a weak spot for musicals and disney, so this one gets the better side of me. ps it looks great on blu ray, I'm glad this is how I saw it for the first time, however, i think ima skip out on 1 and 2...I've never seen them but...they must be alot cheesier than the 3rd one. Ok maybe I will rent. :)
030716327X|5.0|This is a classic book--to be enjoyed by every generation of babies and their families.
B001EAWME2|3.0|I saw the remake in the theatre and never got a chance to check out the original, so i ordered it from amazon on blu ray. Well, it was pretty good. The storyline was kind of slow and not very exciting, the acting was really bad at times and the film wasn't restored as good as I could have expected after seeing the restoration jobs on films like Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I don't like how you never really discover much about the killer, it doesn't make it scarier, just more boring. This film however, had some real gem moments. Sme of the killings and some scenes are pretty groundbreaking. There is suspense and all in all it's a cult classic. I just think it's slightly overrated. It is a solid film though, and every horror fan needs to see this to check out how this paved the directional way of later films in the genre.
B000000ISB|4.0|A little better than the the 1997 remaster, deeper bass and you hear F/X clearer, but not a major impovement like 2112 was!
B001HN6972|5.0|As much as I like Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes, if the truth be known, the performance to watch is that of David Kross who is so utterly believable as the young man who had the misfortune of crossing paths with the older woman of this play.  An innocent drawn initially to Winslet by her maternal caretaking, Kross appears utterly guileless. Yet understandably driven by his sexual awakening, he convincingly shows how the character came to know a different way of being. Concomitantly, Kross has a lovely body, and a twinkling smile, which contrasts with the decaying settings in which it is displayed, much like Dorian Gray, and beautiful to watch.
B000000IR7|4.0|Not as good as other MFSL releases, the kick drum and snare lack bottom end, cymbals are a little aggressive,, piano thought doesn't overload like the 2002 remaster (check Bloody Well Right), there's more dynamic range. Not bad but could have been better!

B001NEK2GE|3.0|I use the n52 Nostromo when playing WoW.  I decided to upgrade to the G13 because of it's features and great reviews.  I just wanted to throw a review to those in the same situation.      My largest problem is the thumb analog stick.  I used the Nostromo thumb pad for my primary abilities, effectively giving me 6 buttons on my thumb alone.  However it is a very hard transition to go from the Nostromo to the G13; as well as an uncomfortable one.  It's not as natural or as comfortable as the Nostromo layout.      This is a good product, but I would not recommend it to former Nostromo users who use the thumb buttons for abilities.  I would wait for either a new g13 type model from logitech, or for Belkin's answer to the G13.     If this is your first gameboard, I'd say its a great device, but if you're making the transition from the Nostromo to the G13 make sure you are able to try it for a week with an option to return.     Note -  If you also use spam macros so you can hold a button down rather than tap it constantly you will run into some annoyances with the g13.  While on the Nostromo its easy to set up, the g13 requires you to add delays in between button actions and after the macro, or you will experience framerate drops and in my case WoW crashes.
B000063UR2|2.0|Luckily I had the forsight to rent the Director's Cut of Legend before buying it on DVD. I have watched the American released version many times since I was a child and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with the Director's Cut. All I can say is a soundtrack and a few scenes can certainly make or break a movie.  I HATED the Director's Cut version. Although Legend is already campy, I felt like the Director's Cut took this movie over the line from endearing to cheestastic.  I could not stop laughing at the way the soundtrack did not fit with the movie.  I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of an old Disney movie.  If you are used to the American release of this movie and the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, do yourself a favor and stick  with what you know when purchasing this movie.
B001TOD92C|5.0|I'm not going to try and get too analytical with this review. &#34;The Wrestler&#34; is about soulfulness - about what's real and whats fake. Love is the most powerful emotion and Mickey Rourke, with the steady hand of Darren Aronofsky, was able to reach way down and tap it. I'm not afraid to admit that I actually felt love for the Ram character - and there is nothing formula about that. The character Rourke created had a reality and a humanity that made me feel his pain like it was my own. I suppose when you're able to recognize yourself in someone else, the boundaries vanish and one feels compassion - one feels love.  The film really moved me, shook me up, and ever since I've seen it, just thinking about Ram stirs my emotions.  This touches something far deeper than sentiment. Mickey Rourke is wearing his soul on his skin (as pointed out by Suzannah Troy). Rourke has always pushed acting into the realm of &#34;the real world&#34;.  He's done this to the point where the characters he's played have seemed to reflect his actual life - and, to a certain extent, his life seemed to be bouncing off into parallel fictions.  As an actor, he seems very technically in control of his craft, of the detail - but as a person, totally out of control when it comes to his life. He's acting and he's living on some very painful but mythic  level - that's what I think makes him so absorbing to watch. I found it so touching to watch this broken down wrestler, this action-figure hero, reaching out, trying to make contact with his daughter and with the Marisa Tomei character - with the feminine - but he was locked into his pain.  There is no &#34;Rocky&#34;, Hollywood ending to this movie. Creating such a pure experience of reality out of something as fake and disrespected as wrestling is really finding the sacred in the profane - its finding something high in what would, on the surface, seem to be low.<br /><br />Aronofsky has created the setting and put his belief in a great actor (who has wrestled many of his own demons) to find redemption and give us all something profound and timeless.led many of his own demons) to find redemption and give us all something profound and timeless.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When OK COMPUTER came out I must have listened to it 200 times.  Few albums that I have ever owned have excited me quite as much as this one.  I played it so many times, in fact, that I overplayed it and didn't start listening to it again until about a month ago.  And I was pleasantly surprised to see that I loved it as much as ever.  This time around I'll try to limit my listening to more moderate quantities.<br /><br />Roughly speaking, OK COMPUTER consists of one absolutely god-awful song, one OK one, and ten absolutely magnificent songs.  The stinker is, of course, \\"Better Happier,\\" which rivals the Beatles' \\"Number 9\\" as one of the worst songs ever to appear on a great album.  Thankfully, with my iPod I can eliminate the noxious song, leaving only the gold.  That one song apart, this album is as close to perfect as an album can get.  The songs are great, the performances equally so, the arrangements perfection.  No wonder that in polls since this came out it has regularly appeared on lists of the greatest albums ever.  I honestly believe it will long be regarded as one of the twenty-five greatest albums ever, right up there with FOREVER CHANGES by Love or ASTRAL WEEKS by Van Morrison or LONDON CALLING by the Clash.  It is the most recent album to be released that clearly deserves inclusion on such a list.  And on a side note that shows how perennially irrelevant the Grammies are, Radiohead's IN RAINBOWS became their first album to get a Grammy nom.  I've repeatedly said that the Grammies are a complete joke, but even so, how could this album not have been nominated, let alone not win?<br /><br />If Radiohead has had a problem, it is that their second and third albums, THE BENDS and this one, were so extraordinary that they have made their other albums -- which were great when compared to the output of other bands -- look bland or average.  IN RAINBOWS was a definite return to form, but THE BENDS and OK COMPUTER so extraordinary that they seem to have entered from another dimension.<br /><br />There is not much more to say.  This album has been so frequently reviewed that anything that I could add would be merely piling away.  I will pick my favs, with the qualification that quibbling between this song and that song is almost silly on an album this good.  It is like picking your favorite cut from ASTRAL WEEKS.  I love the three-song sequence from \\"Exit Music (For a Film),\\" \\"Let Down\\" (as beautifully textured as any song I know), and \\"Karma Police.\\"  Before that \\"Paranoid Android\\" is simply exquisite.  The latter contains one of the nastiest lines ever put to pen:  \\"When I am king you will be first against the wall.\\"  (The nastiest line ever written is without question Robert Johnson's \\"If I had possession of Judgment Day/Then the woman I'm a-seeing wouldn't have no right to pray\\"--he doesn't' just want his woman dead, but suffering in hell; does it get darker than that?)  But if I had to select a single song as a favorite, it might be \\"Lucky.\\"  But like I said, with the one exception, this is not an album of high and low points.  It starts off magnificently and stays that way from beginning to end.<br /><br />Just don't listen to it 200 times in a row.  Beware of album burn out!ension.      There is not much more to say.

080701429X|5.0|I was impressed with the quality of the book copy I recieved, as always. THANKS AMAZON.COM!!! My daughter needed it to earn extra credit in school.

0307455874|5.0|I still vividly remember when I first discovered Barack Obama.  It was the fall of 2003.  At work I always listen all day long to NPR.  From 9 to 10 there is a show entitled 848 (in 2003 I believe it had slightly longer hours), which focuses on local (primarily Chicago but also in Illinois as a whole) affairs.  I got back to my desk with an interview already in progress.  The interviewee was discussing the Iraq War (which he opposed) and universal healthcare (which he thought crucial for the well-being of the country).  Even though he explained that he was not in favor of a single payer healthcare system (he felt the structures were not in place for that), I was impressed with his intelligence and how articulate he was.  During the course of the interview I realized that he was a candidate for the senate seat that Peter Fitzgerald was vacating (848 was doing an hour long interview with all of the Democratic and Republican candidates for the senate seat).  I had been leaning towards Dan Hynes, but I was so impressed listening to this individual that I stayed glued to my radio waiting to hear what his name was.  Then, at the conclusion of the very impressive interview, I heard the announcer thank Barack Obama for participating in the interview.  I was so taken with the candidate that I instantly knew that I was now leaning towards Obama.  I voted for him both in the primary and in the general election.<br /><br />When Barack Obama wrote this book it is pretty obvious that he intended someday to run for president.  It became a commonplace after his electrifying keynote speech at the 2004 Democratic Convention to ponder whether he might one day become president.  The only question would be whether he would run in 2008 or 2012 or 2016.  He was young enough that any of those years were possible.  I personally was hoping for 2008, primarily because I did not believe (and still don't) that Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton's economic views differed substantially from all the presidents from Carter through Bush 43 (Clinton and Reagan are closer in their economic policies than either is to Nixon, who has more in common with all of the presidents on economics from FDR through LBJ than he does to any who came before Obama).  I felt that the number one need for the country was to get away from the string of presidents who contradictorily advocated smaller government (even while people like Reagan and Bush 43 dramatically expanded the size of government), nonprogressive tax cuts (in nearly every instance except one by Clinton shifting the tax burden from the rich to the middle class and working poor), and abandonment of progressive federal programs that had served to empower the middle class from FDR through Nixon.  In other words, we had tried the kinds of free market, small government (even if it wasn't actually smaller government, it was the myth Reagan pushed) policies for decades, and they didn't work.<br /><br />I knew a great deal about Obama's positions on a wide range of issues so at the time I didn't feel that I needed to read this book.  I did know that it stood out from other such books.  Over the past few decades there have been a vast number of books similar to this one published by individuals hoping or planning to run for president.  Most are forgettable.  Does anyone remember that Bush 43 and John McCain wrote similar books?  Though in fairness to Obama, the vast majority of these books are ghostwritten.  THE AUDACITY OF HOPE is unique in that Obama actually wrote it and that it is the rare campaign book that is likely to be remembered.  It is distinguished both by Obama's wonderfully lucid prose style and the breadth of his political vision.  On the former, this is not as well written as his earlier book DREAMS FROM MY FATHER, which almost reaches the level of prose poetry at times.  But that is not surprising.  The earlier book was far more personal and far more literary; the newer book was more of a political credoaddressed to the electorate.<br /><br />What is impressive to me is that despite the various things that were said by Obama during his presidential campaign, as president (so far) his agenda is completely consistent with the views expressed in this book.  If you want to understand Barack Obama and the political values he holds dear, you need to read this book.  In contrast with other political candidates, like Reagan and Bush 43, he isn't the tiniest bit ideological.  He truly does hearken back to FDR (whom he resembles in many ways), in that he is driven not by ideology but values.  Unless one wants to call the generalized belief that all Americans should be well off an ideology.  He is obviously of the opinion that the policies that have driven government the past few decades have not worked and he lays out the nature of the various problems facing the nation and explains what he believes are possible solutions.  Now, as president, he is putting many of these solutions into place.  He definitely looks back to FDR as his political role model.  Though conservative radio talk show hosts disagree, virtually everyone acknowledges that the foundation that FDR laid down in the thirties helped pull the country out of an economic morass and created the longest sustained period of economic success in American history.  Carter began abandoning those policies (it was Carter and not Reagan who began the mania for deregulation) and Reagan accelerated them, leading to three decades of middle class decline (though the decline was slightly reversed during the Clinton years).  Obama more than anything wants a politics centered on the vast majority of Americans and not merely the top 2% of the population.<br /><br />Obama writes with a rare eloquence and intelligence on the problems facing America.  His reflections are also wonderfully nuanced.  He possesses a rare ability to evaluate both himself and the world around him and achieve a balanced and fair view of things.  In the book Obama frequently expresses dissent (he clearly is not fan of George W. Bush) with other views, but at no point is his tone combative or polemical.  He manages to see both sides of every argument, even while coming down strongly on one side of that argument.  To opponents of abortion, he \\"gets\\" their opposition, even while he disagrees.  He understands why many are sceptical of government programs, even while he touts a crucial role for government helping to correct the problems in our society.<br /><br />It is clear from this book that Obama has read deeply in American political history.  He has a profound grasp of the political issues that dominated each era of our nation's history and how they translate into today.  This is hardly surprising, given that he was a constitutional law professor at one of the most prestigious law schools in America, but he doesn't discuss these issues like a professor.  You get the sense that he has mastered an immense body of knowledge about the United States, but has taken a further step to ponder how it all relates to today's political scene.  I have for many years been a fairly serious armchair student of the American presidency.  I've read biographies on most of the American presidents, and sometimes (especially with Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Lincoln, the Roosevelts, and more recent presidents) more than one.  Of all of them, Obama seems to have the most overarching view of America of any since Lincoln (FDR is my favorite president, but he didn't possess the global understanding of either Lincoln or Obama--anyone wanting to see how profound Lincoln's understanding of America was should read his second annual report to congress, now known as the State of the Union Address).  He understands the country in its diversity and complexity.  Although I've long been a supporter of Obama, seeing just how wide-ranging his knowledge of and love for America truly is made me more confident than ever that Obama has a true shot at being a great president.  Whether he will be a truly great president depends on a host of factors, but he certainly seems to be different.  As a student of the presidency, I've often been frustrated reading earlier presidential biographies.  Since becoming an adult I've had to suffer through a long string of average to mediocre presidents.  The presidents from FDR through LBJ were all remarkable, strong, gifted presidents, Democrat and Republican alike.  From Nixon through Bush 43 we've suffered through a string of weak (though in the case of Reagan ridiculously over-hyped) presidents.  This has often happened in American history.  Lincoln was preceded by a string of weak presidents.  McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt were preceded by an equally long string of mediocre presidents while FDR was preceded by a shorter string.  Historically, many of our best presidents have followed weak ones.  I only know that in my adult life this is the first time I've looked at my president with pride and hope.  As a native of Arkansas, I was happy to see an fellow Arkansan in the White House, but while his economic policies were a slight improvement over Reagan and Bush (and certainly the middle class did better under Clinton), he largely to me seemed to be GOP Lite.  Obama just might end up the most exciting president in my lifetime, and hopefully someone that future generations of Americans will envy us for having, just as I've envied others for having presidents like Lincoln and the Roosevelts.ssent (he clearly is not fan of George W. Bush) with other views, but at no point is his tone combative or polemical.  He manages to see both sides of every argument, even while coming down strongly on one side of that argument.

Although I've long been a supporter of Obama, seeing just how wide-ranging his knowledge of and love for America truly is made me more confident than ever that Obama has a true shot at being a great president.  Whether he will be a truly great president depends on a host of factors, but he certainly seems to be different.  As a student of the presidency, I've often been frustrated reading earlier presidential biographies.  Since becoming an adult I've had to suffer through a long string of average to mediocre presidents.  The presidents from FDR through LBJ were all remarkable, strong, gifted presidents, Democrat and Republican alike.  From Nixon through Bush 43 we've suffered through a string of weak (though in the case of Reagan ridiculously over-hyped) presidents.  This has often happened in American history.  Lincoln was preceded by a string of weak presidents.  McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt were preceded by an equally long string of mediocre presidents while FDR was preceded by a shorter string.  Historically, many of our best presidents have followed weak ones.  I only know that in my adult life this is the first time I've looked at my president with pride and hope.  As a native of Arkansas, I was happy to see an fellow Arkansan in the White House, but while his economic policies were a slight improvement over Reagan and Bush (and certainly the middle class did better under Clinton), he largely to me seemed to be GOP Lite.  Obama just might end up the most exciting president in my lifetime, and hopefully someone that future generations of Americans will envy us for having, just as I've envied others for having presidents like Lincoln and the Roosevelts.
1603580557|4.0|Donella H. Meadows takes a multidisciplinary approach in order to convey an understanding to how systems work.  She suggests that the system must operate with its parts and pinpoint problems or deficiencies within a system; when problems exist, redesigning is favorable rather than replacing its parts.  And Meadows takes examples from how a workforce is managed to how a country is governed in order to prove that complexity exists within systems, which are also dependent on structure and behavior.<br /><br />Although the book appears to be geared toward science readers because of its textbook quality, configurations and analogies that appear within the early chapters, that should not discount anyone from reading the rest of the book.  What is important and interesting about THINKING IN SYSTEMS:  A PRIMER is Meadows's findings that cover the gamut from science to politics.  With that framework in mind, a system cannot fully function without a consensus, a shared purpose, or goal that focuses on achieving long-term results.<br /><br />THINKING IN SYSTEMS is a thought-provoking book.  The issues that Meadows addresses are relevant today as they were when she researched this project more than 30 years ago. Thus the book is enlightening and may leave an impression with those who have found themselves in a system that is somewhat dysfunctional and needs restructuring without gaining a loss.
045122499X|3.0|I like pretty much every book I've read by Ken Follett, specially Eye of the Needle and Hammer of Eden. The Pillars of the Earth has always been my most favorite book of all times.     if Pillars had not existed, I'd call World Without End a \\"great\\" book. To me, it's a \\"good\\" book. Right after reading a couple of pages, I started seeing story lines that reminded me way too much of Pillars. I mean, I understand that some characters were descendants of the ones from Pillars, and therefore, they've inherited some of the talents and physique. However, they similarities go way beyond that.    Some of the plot \\"twists\\" were so predictable that I shouldn't even call them a \\"twist\\".     Don't get me wrong; this book is well worth the money and time spent reading it, but I really wished the author hadn't fed so much from his own other masterpiece.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Every good story begins on the day that everything changes. In this case, it's the day Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) lays his wife Dorothy to rest.  You see the typical Catholic funeral and wake with the very traditional Walt far distanced from his sons and their kids.     He's even more distanced from Fr. Janovich (Christopher Carley) the parish priest, who made a promise to Mrs. Kowalski before she died that he'd make sure Walt got to confession.    Walt's response to the priest: \\"I think you're an overeducated 27-year-old virgin who likes to hold the hands of superstitious old ladies and promise them everlasting life.\\"    Once the family's gone, we see Walt's the last remaining resident in a lovely old neighborhood that's become an Asian ghetto. The mutli-generation Vietnamese family next door has problems of their own.  Young Thao (Bee Vang) is being recruited by the local gang.  His sister Sue (Ahney Her) is getting hustled by young men who only want to use her as a pretty face.     You're going to hear a lot of racial epithets from an old man who fought in Korea. His neighbors look like the enemy who haunt his dreams and as he says to one gang member: \\"I used to stack @#$* like you, five feet high in Korea, use ya for sand bags.\\"    Yet, as time goes by Walt comes to know his neighbors and his neighborhood.  He sees the war between people trying to live their lives honestly and the gangs who'd steal that honest living and not look back. Walt's gradually assimilated into this community and the 'old dog learns a few tricks' as well as teaching some strength and courage to young Thao.      \\"Gran Torino\\" is the best Clint Eastwood film I have seen so far.  He's matured as both an actor and director and while is work in this film is not as polished as \\"Changeling,\\" it's a heartfelt effort.  This is one film I have seen in the theatres and probably will own and watch again.     Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
0156030209|5.0|Pi grew up in unique circumstances.  His father was a zookeeper and Pi always had access to exotic animals.  Through his constant observation, he learned to identify and respect their personalities and similarities to humans, while remaining perfectly clear on the fact that zoo animals are still wild and exceptionally dangerous.    When Pi was sixteen, his family decided to move from India to Canada.  Pi's father arranged for many of the zoo animals to be sold to North America, so Pi and his brother and their parents, plus a variety of animals, boarded a ship for the long voyage.    In the middle of the ocean, something went terribly wrong.  When the ship sank, Pi found himself on a lifeboat with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a tiger.  Soon, Pi found himself on a lifeboat with just a tiger.  It's lucky Pi grew up in a zoo and knew a lot about wild animal behavior.    The remainder of Pi's journey across the ocean was riveting; I loved reading about his will to survive and the ways he ensured that he would not become a meal for either the tiger on the boat or the sharks below it.  I loved that the tiger was never regarded as harmless; he was always a force to be reckoned with and Pi spent the majority of his waking hours thinking of ways to keep the tiger at bay.    I liked the way that Pi's religious background molded him into the sort of person who could conceivably survive a shipwreck and month after month on a lifeboat with a tiger without going completely crazy or giving into despair.  He was a calm, thinking, creative character.  I also really liked the ending of this book with the alternate story, and the way Pi is so serene about presenting the two options.    The book didn't make me believe in God.  But it did make me admire this author who could write a story this compelling and turn such a ridiculous concept into something nearly believable.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is thoroughly out of touch with his 17 year old daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace). For her 17th birthday, he gives the girl a karaoke machine while her rich stepdad gives her the horse of her dreams. He is very much in touch with the too-real world of crime being a retired 'fixer' for an undisclosed US government agency.    Bryan gives Kim grief when she wants to spend vacation in Paris with an older friend.  He signs her parental permission to go out of country with a long set of stipulations:    1. call when she's landed  2. call every night  3. call when she's ready to take off    Yet, the minute Kim sets foot on French soil, she's doomed.  She's not there a day before Albanian white slavers kidnap her and her friend.      Luckily, Kim's on the phone with her Dad when the kidnappers strike.  She gives Dad who has 'a particular set of skills' enough description that he's headed for Paris to get his daughter back and he's got 96 hours to do it.     \\"Taken\\" shows you a very hard man with a very human side. Neeson's depiction of Bryan Mills is what makes an otherwise stereotyped impossible odds film very real and compelling. All through the white-knuckle suspense, you are rooting for Mills and Neeson just does not disappoint.      \\"Taken\\" is not a film for really young kids.  It just barely comes in with a PG-13 rating, but it's definitely a film that teenaged girls could benefit by watching.  And action fans are going to love this one.     Rebecca Kyle, March 2009
B00006J3T4|5.0|like the Dire Straits albums, this is a Mark Knopfler album I enjoy listening to straight through.  the weakest track is probably \\"why aye man\\":  the musical arrangement was not quite so easy to listen to.
B00005JM20|3.0|This James Bond spoof, headed by British comedian Rowan Atkinson, was okay....a fair amount of laughs but not enough to add this film to my collection.......but it's worth a rental.    Atkinson reminded me a bit of Benny Hill, a more famous English comedian who also doesn't speak much but lets his actions and facial expressions garner his laughs. Both are likable guys.    John Malkovich plays a Frechman here and his accent is pretty good. He seems to be always playing strange roles.    There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film. Except for a very funny toilet scenes, much of it isn't that memorable. Just a lightweight hour-and-a-half of entertainment.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|MAD MEN is the best television series since SIX FEET UNDER. Excellent actors, excellent writing and the best design elements of any show in recent history. The show works not only on the level of dramatic intrigue into the psychology and relationships of the characters but as a statement on American culture. Themes explored include gender roles, sexual orientation, race relations and capitalism. Every episode leaves you wanting more.
0783240287|5.0|This was much better than I thought it might be, and I give it a high grade in a number of areas, beginning with production. This looked good, sounded good and simply was good! For some reason, I didn't expect much from Donny Osmond. I guess this Osmond is a lot more talented than people like me give him credit for, and I won't make that mistake again.     I'd say the same for Joan Collins, who I could not picture in a \\"biblical film,\\" but she did just fine. Then again, she played the villainous \\"Potiphar,\\" so it wasn't like she was playing against type!    The story stayed true to the Bible and the presentation was so well done - and so incredibly colorful on this DVD - that is was a very satisfying and entertaining adaptation.. Besides being a classic Old Testament story, this is a real visual treat.  I'd love to see this on Blu-Ray!
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I don't know how to say this, Wall-e is so great in many ways i can't even start to describe it.    It's a MUST buy for everyone that Owns a Blu-ray Player, the quality is over the top.    Pixar is Pixar, no one will even get close to them ;D
B000031EGV|5.0|Among the thousands of films I have seen, this movie would rank near the top for sheer entertainment. That's not saying it's the best-made or most intelligent or scariest or funniest or features the best effects, etc. etc. But combine all those and you have a film that's tough to beat when you're looking for 100 minutes of escapist fun.    The film features some wild computer-enhanced special effects that were new to its day, but now about 10 years later, it's no big deal. In fact, some of it, such as the lion, look pretty hokey compared to the stuff that's out there now. To me, it was story that was the lure, anyway, not the special effects.    Because it's so much fun, this is one of the fastest-moving films I've ever viewed. The time flies by. It's not to be analyzed or given much thought, because it's so ludicrous. You just go along for the wild ride in this fantasy-adventure and get a bunch of laughs and thrills along the way.     Robin Williams, David Alan Grier and the two kids, Kristen Dunst and Bradley Pierce, were all great people to watch and share this adventure with.
B00005JKGK|4.0|I received the dvd in a timely matter, and it was in \\"new\\" condition.  I would recommend them.
B001ED7C58|1.0|Its a soundtrack for an overrated book whose plot is Dawson's Creek with Vampires. There is nothing special about this soundtrack. It is an assortment of music the author listened to while writing the books. There are no new tracks, no new songs, no nothing. Just an amalgamation of music to keep highschoolers placid until the next movie comes out.    Oh wait, you mean we're going to bring werewovles into this? you mean like Underworld? So basically, the sequel is going to be Dawson's Creek blended with Underworld. wow. how original.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|In the sequel to Casino Royale we find Mr. Bond dealing with some issues about Vesper and the organization behind Le Chiffre. The ending was a little suprizing but I love this film and will buy it on DVD.  Daniel Craig has been critized for portraying Mr. Bond so darkly.  I say thank god this James Bond is dark.  The wink wink nod nod to the camera with the other actors was getting on my nerves.  I say Daniel Craig is the best Bond of this generation.  I hope the directors/producers and Mr. Craig keep up this darkly played Bond...he's facinating!

B00005LC1H|5.0|These products were originally enjoyed on ordinary television 30-40 years ago without the technology avalalble today.  Does that make them less entertaining NOW?

You should be too.

0760750750|5.0|The Collector's Library is a line of over fifty books published in an elegant and compact, pocket-sized form.  Their Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is the twelve short stories first published in The Strand magazine in 1891-2 and published in book form by Harper & Brothers in 1892.  These are the earliest published Sherlock Holmes mysteries (not to be confused with his earliest cases).  It includes a publisher's afterword that discusses the role of the author, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, in the evolution of the detective story genre.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is its compact size and elegant presentation. It has a very nice cloth hardcover binding, gold foil edging, and a nice paper cover.  There is also a bound-in cloth page marker.  This is a 2004 edition.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys rereading favorite Sherlock Holmes mysteries will love this little volume.  If you have never read any of his adventures, then this is a great place to start.<br /><br />(Note:  These comments are general observations about the publication and may not reflect the specific conditions of particular books that may be on sale here.)

B001EN71DQ|3.0|Fact is, there are many people out there who will use whatever it takes to make money off of the Star Wars name, which is why I insist on only buy what I really want. A lot of people will buy this boxset, which I can understand, but the question is... Is it really worth it?    My review for the movies:    Episode 1 - On top of the terrible CGI and the cardboard characters, the movie is about as slow as paint drying and takes forever to get to the action. People liked it when it first came out just to see a lightsaber battle, but since then, people have woken up. Jar Jar Binks may very well be the worst character in the series. 2.5/5 Stars    Episode 2 - Yet another movie that works about as slow as a turtle. While the epic battle at the end was worth the wait, the movie as a whole doesn't work. The romance subplot doesn't give in due to lame script writing, and several sub-plots wern't interesting at all. The only good thing is that the CGI has improved since Episode 1. 2/5 Stars    Episode 3 - Finaly we have a movie worthy of the name Star Wars. While this movie DOES rely on tons of eye candy and special effects, at least we have a movie that moves on to the action quicker and leaves the pointless sub-plots aside. The movie also provided some decent character development even though the script was (again) lacking. 3.5/5 Stars    So to sum up the entire Prequel trilogy, I'd have to say that only 2 of the movies are worth your time, but only 1 is worth watching more than once. What does that really say about the trilogy?     To make a long story short, stick to the original trilogy (which is Epsiode 4, 5, and 6 in case you didn't know). Don't let the prequels waste away your time.
B001DM9FM8|5.0|I saw this tour in Chicago...blew me away...I may have been the psychedelics, pouring rain, mud sliding or a combination of it all... This excellent set took me right back to the fun rockin bluesy sounds of the Black Crowes mixed with the mesmerizing shredding of the Zoso man himself...!
B001EN71DG|5.0|A lot of people are upset that they released another boxed set with the original Star Wars trilogy. This I can understand, but what people don't realize is that this set contains the original versions of the movies, and not the versions George went back and screwed with. No more out of place CGI shots. Disc 1 of all three movies is the CGIed versions, but the bonus disc contain the original versions (which are the ones to watch). Although a lot of people would complain that the original versions aren't in anamorphic widescreen, it doesn't mean much to me at all.        For the movies themselves -     Star Wars - An amazing, campy movie. Great characters, special effects (for the time), and a story with nonstop action. A lot of fun, and nothing else. 4.5/5 Stars    The Empire Strikes Back - One of the greatest movies of all time. Simply an outstanding movie chalked full of amazing special effects. This movie combines the fun of the original with a hint of seriousness and black humor. One of my favorites. 5/5 Stars    The Return of the Jedi - The most action packed of all the movies. I thought that the sub-plot with Jabba The Hutt went on for a little too long, but the rest of the movie is up to par with the first two. Great fun all around. 4/5 Stars        So overall, what do I really need to say about the trilogy? The boxed set contains the good versions, so what are you waiting for?
B000M341RI|4.0|wonderfully funny movie, some touching scenes others a little overdone. sound could be a bit louder, some parts are difficult to hear. all in all, a great picture and the characters all seem perfect for their roles.

1582701709|4.0|The principle of law of attraction is rather simple: ask, believe, and receive, and this book irrefutably elucidates the idea in a clear and enthralling fashion. Several coauthors' heartfelt languages along with legendary aphorisms thruout the history flesh out the entire book. It's an easy read: you could finish it within a day.     Although the quantum physics may be its only scientific bastion, \\"the law\\", whether you like to call it \\"higher self\\", \\"God\\", \\"spiritual guidance\\", \\"Oyasama\\" (Shin Buddhism term), \\"other power\\" or \\"universe energy\\", seem to be observed and embodied from time to time and place to place. I don't think it's a new-age thing. Many religiously eclectic testimonies and my personal experience tell me that the secret is shockingly efficacious, somehow. There is something you can't change. You can't fight the nature, but you may let nature help you change what you can, especially mentally and spiritually.     My little grumbling is that from a censorious perspective it is a bit overpriced. The text offers only general guidelines and you'd have to experience yourself instead of just reading it and receiving wonderful things. But isn't it the nature of self-help books? Sometimes succinctness is more powerful. There is another merit: the page design is delicate, artistic and pleasing to the eye. It could be added to your collection.
B00168OINK|5.0|There are plenty of reviews here about the movie itself, so I'll just limit my comments to the quality of this movie in Blu-Ray. To date this is the most astonishing Blu-Ray movie I've seen. The detail is astounding, you can see each blade of grass and tree leaf in full hi-def glory and they are actually moving in the wind! Every texture on every surface was lovingly modeled by the animation team and show up in crisp, clear detail on our 52\\" Bravia. The closer you get to the TV the more detail you see, it's really quite amazing. I watched it at home the first time with my older daughter and the entire movie we were saying things like \\"look at the texture on his clothes!\\" \\"Look at the moss growing on the rocks!\\" We barely noticed the dialog because we were so floored by the incredible visuals! We typically rent movies, but this particular one was a must-own just to show visitors to our home what Blu-Ray and hi-def TVs are all about. Plus as others here have said it's a great movie for kids and adults alike, and that's icing on this glorious 1080p cake :-)

B000VZUWZW|5.0|The show is hilarious.  Psych and communications tests show that maybe 10% of the population, more male than not, tending to go into science, math, and engineering, mostly \\"does not get\\" the normal social interations of everyone else, and doesn't feel the emotional bonds the same way the other 90% do.  They live more in their heads than emotionally, and therefore learn social interations and how to communicate by watching and studying.  This show is right out of my life and touches home, in response to the reviews by people saying folks like this just don't exist.  I see myself, friends, and co-workers in these characters, only the actors do it better.  They manage to make these otherwise disaffected, difficult to get along with people real, lovable, and understandable, and above all, laughs with them, not at them.  That is a high art.
0199206589|1.0|This is such a rich subject - with a few thousand years of history to animate its examples and counter-examples, but unfortunately the author really can't stop himself from writing a long contemporary Guardian-type op-ed that reflects standard British academic bias about America, American politics, American policy, and American leaders.  It is very contemporary (whereas the genius of geopolitics itself is of course that its fundamentals are constant), very opinionated in a smarmy dinner party sort of way, i.e. bemoaning the 2004 US election results - bringing to mind the British newspaper headline of the time, \\"How Could 52 Million Yanks Be So Stupid?\\"  Unfortunately the author is not a good contemporary political commentator, especially on current American politics - with which he is absolutely obsessed - making, for instance, the laughable argument that Hollywood carries conservative America's bathwater.  Now that would be news to Sean Penn, Alex Baldwin, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins!    What a loss.  The editors should have a re-do and assign the title to an author who actually wants to write a primer about geopolitics.

0307387178|2.0|This is an odd book to review because it is difficult to separate my feelings toward the actions of Chris McCandless and the writing of the book. Normally, strong feelings about the main character would say something about the writing, but this story is a biography, so any reaction I had toward the main character's actions was more of a statement about the person and not about the writing.<br /><br />For those that do not know the story of Chris McCandless, he was a young man who hitchhiked his way to Alaska to live off the land. I heard about him in an English class. I pictured a daring young man. Someone who was not afraid to take chances and who lived the dream many people have had. There have been times that I was tempted to drop everything and just start walking. No phones, no television, no computers. It sounds wonderful, but then I would receive a call from my husband. I would be reminded of those that love me and my responsibilities towards them. This is where my issues with Chris McCandless begin. Yes, he was daring and brave, but he was also selfish and cruel. He left without a word to any of his family about his plans. For years they did not know what happened to him or where he was. He never called to say, \\"Hey mom! I'm okay and having the time of my life. Don't worry.\\" His lack of regard towards his responsibilities as a son and brother effected me the most. Other people may be more irritated by his lack of planning before going into the wilds of Alaska, and others still may empathize with his wondering spirit. Regardless of your personal views and situations, there is something in Chris McCandless's story to which you will react strongly.<br /><br />As for the writing, it was average. The author did illustrate the good and the bad of McCandless, but it was not a secret that the author saw him as a bit of a hero. I did not care for the way the story's time line was told in a circle. He told the story from beginning to end, but did not provide the full story. After reaching the end he then returned to the beginning of the story to fill in the holes. I think this was done so that the reader would have a better understanding of McCandless's thoughts and feelings that drove his actions, but the method fell short. I just found it annoying. The author also included some personal experiences, so that the reader would be more likely to sympathize than to judge. Again, I felt the method fell short. They slowed down the story.<br /><br />The tale of Chris McCandless is almost a cliche. A young man leaves home to find himself by wandering the country and living in the wilds. It is a coming of age and survival story that everyone has heard before. The book Into the Wild does not offer anything new to this kind of tale. If someone is interested in reading specifically about Chris McCandless, they would get just as much information and save time by reading the news release.hing the end he then returned to the beginning of the story to fill in the holes. I think this was done so that the reader would have a better understanding of McCandless's thoughts and feelings that drove his actions, but the method fell short. I just found it annoying. The author also included some personal experiences, so that the reader would be more likely to sympathize than to judge. Again, I felt the method fell short. They slowed down the story.    The tale of Chris McCandless is almost a cliche. A young man leaves home to find himself by wandering the country and living in the wilds. It is a coming of age and survival story that everyone has heard before. The book Into the Wild does not offer anything new to this kind of tale. If someone is interested in reading specifically about Chris McCandless, they would get just as much information and save time by reading the news release.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|One thing that the had missing from the Indiana Jones trilogy was science fiction. Well now we have an X-Files version of Indiana... for what it is worth.<br /><br />  Let's be fair - it is a little better than Temple of Doom - however, it is a far cry from \\"Raiders\\" or \\"Crusade\\". The first half of the movie was reminiscent of the Raiders of the Lost Ark and had my expectations high... however at that point it takes a right turn and turns into a 1950's B movie that focuses on aliens. Most surprising is that this was exactly what Lucas and Spielberg were aiming for. According to the interviews that is included in the extras Spielberg states they wanted to redo Indiana and stylize it into the 1950's era. Not a bad idea, but it did not work for me.<br /><br />My biggest complaint - Shia Labeouf was terribly miscast and (in my opinion) nearly ruined the movie.  Let's hope that if another Indiana Jones is made that he is left on the sideline.<br /><br />Final Verdict -<br /><br />  Not bad - however, most Indiana Jones fans will range from mildly satisfied to devastated. For me - I am glad that I watched it - but when I am looking to kill a little a time by watching a Indy movie... I will grab \\"Raiders\\" or \\"Crusade\\" and leave<br />The Crystal Skull\\" on the shelf.<br /><br />3 Stars
B000FVNX2Q|2.0|I've given this only two stars not because it is a bad calculator, but that it is no longer needed.  As a financial analyst, I coveted mine back in the day and used it constantly with it's reverse Polish notation.  Times have changed and things have gotten much better.  I now use spreadsheets for calculations and many are freely available for those who can't create them.  Calculators are now used on the fly for the simplest of the four math functions (add, subtract, multiply and divide).  The new ones are thin, light, show large numbers and cheap.  I have one that keeps a running electronic tape so I can check my input. Who today would want to drive a model T when others are whizzing by in their newer models?
015204907X|5.0|I love this book, and my kids do, too! It's been a favorite read-aloud story in my kids' preschool classes for years. It's also great for early reading/learning to read because of the repetition. Very sweet, very fun book.
B001RTSF6E|4.0|I bought this book as a gift for a small child and I'm pretty particular about what I give to small children so I'd have to say, this book is very good - or I wouldn't have purchased it.
B000VWE5OY|2.0|Torchwood - what a great idea for a Dr. Who spin-off!  A little more dark than Who?  Well, OK.  Unfortunately the show is so dark it is depressing.  In almost every episode someone close to a main character dies unpleasantly, everyone in Torchwood betrays everyone else, all beautiful things have horror inside, and as one character says \\"no one is nice, nobody cares.\\"  Such a pity - it could have been fun.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST HISTORY I'VE EVER WATCHED AND DIDN'T GET IN SCHOOL.  ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD SHOW IT!!
B001E95ZI8|5.0|It's a great movie for any music fan and rockers, it makes a person want to start a band and enjoy the awesomeness of rock music!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|How can you beat season 1 of HIMYM?  Well, watch Season 2!<br /><br />Really, every episode of this show is hilarious and worth the time.  I love to sit back in the evening and just kick back and relax and laugh at Barney, Marshall, Lilly, Ted & Robin.  And once in a while wonder WHEN we will meet the MOTHER?!<br /><br />Great show, great acting & writing.  Onto season 3!
B001N44BVQ|2.0|(With apologies to Amanda Richards)<br /><br />SHORT ATTENTION SPAN SUMMARY (SASS):<br /><br />1. If you don't like DiCaprio, This movie will NOT change your mind<br />2. He plays a different role here<br />3. But character-wise, he seems to be rehashing his style from The Departed<br />4. He seems to be placed in a quite out-of-place story<br />5. The story seems to be about a CIA agent who works with the Jordanian secret service<br />6. Things get ugly<br />7. The plot then contradicts itself over and over<br />8. The viewer is left scratching his head<br /><br />I do admire Ridley Scott for making a movie about what is going on in Jordan, but it just comes off as silly and campy. DiCaprio is decent here, this is not his best performance. Crowe seems to be going through the motions here, and yet again the movie comess across as one you should miss. The plot has a lot of potential, but the end result is one that you're left going \\"WTF did I just watch???\\".<br /><br />Look, this movie is not bad. It has a few cool scenes and well-choreographed action. But this movie takes itself WAY too seriously and in the end, you'll be wishing you watched something different.<br /><br />OVERALL: 2/5 stars.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Finally, I gave it and gave this show a shot.  While I've never been a Neil Patrick Harris fan, I was reluctant.  However, wow, what an entertaining, funny, show!  FRIENDS, how I miss you Rachel, Joey, Monica, Ross, Chandler, Phoebe...but look out, TV has a new version for Y2K.<br /><br />Season 1 has many memorable moments, and builds the basis for this show and the character background and development.  I think it only took us two weeks to run through it, with quick half hour episodes this makes it a perfect sit back and relax show at the end of the evening, watching a few at a time.<br /><br />If you haven't caught this show, check it out!!
B00027JZ3E|5.0|This movie was just as good if not better than I remember.  Wonderful flick!!
B001P9KR94|5.0|I saw all the best movies of this year and i think Slumdog was the best great story amazing directing bravo to Danny Boyle and all the cast i left the cinema with a big smile i loved this flick.
0385338732|5.0|This book is really interesting, because it has a bit of a twist to it. When I read it, I didn't want to stop reading. I always thought, \\"What's going to happen next??\\" If her situation happened to me in real life, it would be a crazy journey.. people taking advantage of me.. telling false information, because of amnesia. I would recommend this book to those who follow Sophie's books.
1400032717|5.0|This is a novel of great compassion, intelligently written.  It is eloquent, poignant, sad, darkly humorous and unforgettable.
B001TOD92C|4.0|Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert often says, \\"It doesn't matter what a movie is about, but how it's about it.\\" In other words, any topic can make a good movie, if the filmmakers & actors use the tools correctly. For too long, pro wrestling has been dismissed in the entertainment community. Darren Aronofsky's THE WRESLTER isn't going to convince people to start watching televised wrestling, but it will certainly put a heartbreaking face on a business that is often called \\"fake.\\"     THE WRESTLER begins with a credit sequence, showing hundreds of fake magazine covers and newsclips which detail the rise of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson. After the glorious hard rock music comes to a close, \\"The Ram\\" is seated in a lonely corner, surrounded by toddler tables and toys. His pay is less than he expected. His fans ask for autographs of photos from a time that's been long gone. His home is a trailer that he can't afford to keep the landlord from locking out of.     Randy continues to perform, however, because that indominable spirit that exists in most professional wrestlers has overpowered his common sense. After a particularly vicious hardcore match (where the two opponents use glass and ladders and staple guns), Randy passes out. He soon learns that his heart can no longer endure the intensity of wrestling.     Mickey Rourke deserves all of the accolades he's received. He clearly performed some of his own wrestling maneuvers, and delivers the kind of performance he's always been capable of since the 80s, but rarely delivered since then. Rourke knows how to look when in the wrestling ring, knows when to brood in his sadness, knows how to desparately relate to the young kids in his trailer park, and even knows how Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson breathes. It's not a show-stealing performance, but a subtle one that draws you in from start to finish.     Watching Randy Robinson's life outside of the wrestling ring is where this movie really shines. There are two outstanding performances from Marisa Tomei and Evan Rachel Wood. Wood plays Randy's daughter Stephanie, a young woman who rarely saw her father, and has becoming increasingly resentful of his absence in her life. It's a shame that the dramatic moment where Randy cries his soul out to Stephanie has been played for critics and TV coverage; thankfully, it's still a powerful scene. It's followed by a touching dance between the father & daughter, in a room with no music, but the two at least have their harmony for that brief moment in time.     Marisa Tomei plays Cassidy, a stripper whom Randy frequently visits. Tomei's character gives the \\"veteran who won't retire\\" story some much welcome depth. She shares Randy's struggle to remain in the spotlight with a generation that no longer wants her. There are several occasions where Cassidy offers the customers a good time, and they bluntly refuse her services. In perhaps the best scene of the movie, Cassidy and \\"The Ram\\" finally go to a bar together, and reminisce about how great the 80s were for them. It's a scene of masterful acting, where we sense that the two actors are actually listening to the other's feelings. Almost 20 years ago, Marisa Tomei was heavily-criticized for winning an Academy Award in a performance that most thought required little effort. Let me tell you all something, the best actors are the ones who you forget are acting, and when you start calling the stripper \\"Cassidy\\" instead of \\"Marisa Tomei's character\\".     Mickey Rourke, Evan Rachel Wood, and Marisa Tomei add a wonderful dose of reality to THE WRESTLER, a movie that addresses an industry that celebrates hyperealism. Darren Aronofsky is to be commended for restraining his stylized visuals when he directed this feature film. REQUIEM FOR A DREAM was a powerful piece of anti-drug cinema, but THE WRESTLER is thankfully much more like the gentle ROCKY than like Oliver Stone's supercharged ANY GIVEN SUNDAY. Besides, THE WRESTLER isn't even a sports movie; it's a movie abouta sports entertainer. Some wrestling fans might not like how the film focuses more on Randy Robinson than the world of professional wrestling. But hopefully they'll realize that the movie would've betrayed its story by focusing on the in-ring spectacle. You can't feel the sadness of an old-timer's unrequited passion if you're constantly sitting under the bright lights and alongside the rabid crowds.     My only critcism of THE WRESTLER is that the in-ring action might not please longtime wrestling fans. There are basically three matches in the movie, and the first one is a frightening letdown. I've been to many local shows, and the main event is never a 3-minute contest. The other two matches are acceptable, and are made better because of their dramatic implications. I will leave you to discover how those play out in the story. In a way, this criticism is a compliment, because I sincerely believe that people who are NOT wrestling fans will enjoy this movie MORE than those of us who are. And when \\"The Ram\\" makes his final leap to glory, and Bruce Springsteen's wonderful song plays over the black curtain call, we all feel for \\"The Ram\\". We condemn his self-inflicted damage, but admire his courageous spirit. In the end, THE WRESTLER makes it our responsibility to decide if pro wrestling has destroyed \\"The Ram\\", or has saved him. I don't which side of the fence you'll be on, but any movie that gets you talking about the fenceline is well worth your time.    ***PS, how did Bruce Springsteen not get nominated for the Oscar for Best Song?  That is beyond ridiculous!?***

6304711905|5.0|Forget Val in Batman: THIS is the movie you want to see if you're a Kilmer fan.  That said, Kurt Russell wasn't too bad himself.  Combine it with Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" for a balanced picture of the man. Extra features are thorough and informative.
0743201140|5.0|\\"Now, Discover Your Strengths\\" provides a very insightful Strengths profile that is more than worth the price of the book. In fact, the book strengthens the profile. I bought books for everyone on staff and we all participated. Very enlightening.    Tom Crouser
B00005JN8Z|5.0|If you want to see what the film industry was capable of in the early 1950s, then forget the miscasting of Robert Taylor and concentrate on the superb performance by Sir Peter Ustinov.  That, and the incredible score by Miklós Rózsa, alone make the price of this DVD worthwhile.  Only in Ben-Hur did the maestro outdo himself, and many echos from Quo Vadis are present in the 1959 Wyler epic.  The plot may be slightly inane and certain scenes are over-the-top, but the lush photography and superb music make it all worth your 175 minutes.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The best movie, I have ever seen. One of the plus in the movie is music...Wow, stunning musics, just hear the soundtracks especially Lathika Theme then you will know what i meant (splendid work by A.R rahman).
B00132D808|5.0|This album is even better than \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"  Pretty. Odd. has an amazing new sound, sort of like combining their earlier stuff with The Beatles.  The result is different, but it definitely works.  Buy this CD if you like great music.
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Such a clever cast and a wickedly funny movie!!  A little slow in the beginning, but it sets you up to understand and really feel the movie later on.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|Another good CD from FOB.  As in Infinity On High, their sound has evolved and now has a slightly electronic feel.  It's not quite as good as Infinity on High, but I definitely recommend this album.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt, based on the Tony award winning play, is perhaps the most well acted film of the year, with four of its stars being nominated for Oscar's and a screenplay that blurs the line between who is right and who is wrong.<br /><br />Sister Aloysius is the strict, hard nosed principle of the local Catholic school who finds herself in the midst of a personal battle between one of the priest, Father Flynn, who may or may not be abusing one of the altar boys. With the help of a fellow nun, the two of them investigate to uncover the truth and bring justice to light.<br /><br />As mentioned before, this film is superbly acted. Meryl Streep, already a legend, earned her fifteenth nomination for her role, who balances wit, steely demure, and when she let loose in some of the confrontations, its a very powerful thing to watch. Phillip Seymore Hoffman imbues Father Flynn with so much warm and kindness it most certainlty instills doubt in the viewer if he truly is capable of such a horrible act. Amy Adams acts as the mediator between the two, always holding her own against the two experience actors. And finally Viola Davis, who joins the select few actors to make the most out of a limited role.<br /><br />The film is very shady about the details about the crime and never gives any explicit details. This causes you to wonder, did Father Flynn do it? Is Sister Aloysius wrong? As the film goes on, you get little snip its of details that one moment will say the two nuns are right and then the next putting that questioning feeling in you and by the end of the film (spoiler alert! do not read on if you have not seen the film!) you are left to wonder, did Father Flynn really do it? or was it all just an overblown lie?<br /><br />This is a must see film for anyone who has followed the award season.
1568814518|5.0|Wonderful book if you are interested in origami tessellations. The book's layout is excellent with many ideas to get you started but not so many so that you feel overwhelmed.   Just watch out if you are expecting such origami tessellations to be similar to conventional origami - they actually aren't, but they are not very difficult to learn, and they are fascinating, especially if you are the type that likes modular origami and are interested in the geometry and patterns.
B001FOPODS|5.0|When I was a kid I listened to Prokofiev's Peter & the Wolf a couple of times.  Okay, the various instruments representing Peter and the assorted animals were supposed to accomplish storytelling through music.  This might have captivated kids way back when, but it didn't really work its spell on me.  Not until I saw this stop-frame animation version from Breakthru Films.  This is absolutely charming storytelling that appeals to all ages.  Only the willfully jaded and most tenacious cynics will be able to resist the appeal of this delightful animated rendition of Peter and the Wolf.  It is also an improvement on the original tale; it is largely free of boring cliches of good vs evil, and it has a more uplifting ending. - I would rank this right up there with Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro as a true charmer.
B001H9MWW2|5.0|This is REALLY different! I did not expect the new CD to be like this although when I heard Brian Eno was going to be producing, I had a feeling it would be different.  I was not able to grasp it all at first. I mean they are radically changing their sound here, completely different instrumentation, orchestration, and production. My first instinct is I don't like some of it it because it sounds like a band trying to really experiment. I think Coldplay thought after X&Y they had become a bit too predictable and formulative.  Although I believe that is true somewhat (some of it was boring), although there were certainly a lot of good songs on X&Y.  Especially if you include all the bonus tracks from the same sessions released in various forms. Well Coldplay is certainly not predictable here I do like many of the songs though, I LOVE the title song!  This will go down as one of my favorite Coldplay songs of all time!  I also like the first single, Violet Hill.  I also love Cemeteries Of London which has the trademark U2 guitar style (but that's not a bad thing here).  I also like Lost, including the acoustic version.  42 starts off very brooding and ends with a great musical piece.  It's a good song, and the start of a lot experimentation.  Lovers In Japan has a lot of instrumentation overlay, not a bad song but kind of a basic Coldplay song (like X&Y).  Than we come to songs like Yes and Strawberry Swing which like I said I cannot really appreciate.  I have to say I probably like Yes better because it's more upbeat but it's like two songs because the second half sounds completley different (and perhaps goes on too long).  Death And All His Friends also starts off brooding low key and than works up in a similar fashion as the great song Fix You did!  In the end I can say if your a Coldplay fan, the CD is very much buying.  I love several of the songs and like many others.  Albums like this can grown on you and later you may appreciate it more than you think. Coldplay still stands as my favorite modern group and this CD was bold enough to experiment with their sound and make something different!  I don't think another CD in the same direction of X&Y would have worked out for them. 2008 was no time for this band to get stuck in a rut!  The EP side Prospekt's March also has SEVERAL more tracks to make up for the couple I did not like on Viva. If you put them both together, you have 40-45 minutes of GREAT Coldplay music with a couple throw aways on each disc!  Prospekts March also didn't need those remikes.
0316017922|2.0|Outliers can be summed up shortly by saying that chance, effort and help from others are very important to the success of an individual.  If you already belive this, read this book only for enjoyment.<br /><br />But then if you want to be a \\"success\\" you don't have time to be reading this book, you should be devoting this time to getting your 10,000 hours in your chosen profession!!!
B000002OOY|5.0|To keep it precise - this is no doubt either Williams best or close to best score of all time. .There is, unlike most of John Williams' soundtracks, only one concert revision ( the theme from Jurassic Park.) I Also recommend The Lost World & Jurassic Park III, mainly Jurassic Park III if you want to hear an expansion of Williams' themes, which he all but destroyed for the sequel score.
B00005AG7K|5.0|The DVD of Magical Mystery Tour cannot be found anywhere else. It was so easy to find along with a great price at Amazon. I was so happy to receive this. The only problem, is the faded colors of the scenes. For a Beatle fan, it is a great find!!!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is one of the funniest things I have ever seen. I actually got them on Itunes when they first came out and loved it so much that I felt compelled to buy the DVD to help the cause. The cast did such a great job. NPH can sing!
B0011KQSZ4|4.0|\\"Death at a Funeral\\" is set at the home of a wealthy British family that is burying its patriarch.  As the family converges for the funeral, several things start to go wrong--the boyfriend of a cousin takes some acid (by accident), the famous brother can't get it together, and oh yeah, the deceased's secret gay lover has shown up (with photos) to blackmail the family.  Hilarity ensues despite the sensitive subject matter.<br /><br />This movie's slapstick humor is laugh out funny, and in the end everything turns out okay.  This movie is definitely worth a watch for the funny way it confronts family drama and the secrets we all keep at a difficult time.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Muse have been making great music for nearly a decade and it surprises me how overlooked they get in the musical landscape.  This CD/DVD should help them join the ranks of the best rock acts in the world.  I have been reading the negative reviews of the DVD and I could not disagree more with everybody's opinion that there is too much crowd shots, and not enough action on the band playing.  Yes, the camera does pan to the crowd a lot, and sometimes the camera moves too quickly, but by panning to the crowd it shows how much everybody is enjoying the show.  Meanwhile, Bellamy and the boys are able to have great showmanship and pander to the crowd terrifically.    This DVD was shot over two days at Wembley stadium and you can tell how passionate Muse and their fans are about their music.  The beginning of this DVD has them rising out on a hydraulic platform and into a stream of confetti, and then they burst into \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" which is an amazing song that gets the crowd excited.  They follow that up with \\"Hysteria\\" keeping the crowd enthused, Bellamys solo on this song is amazing and will keep in you awe every time you listen to this CD or watch this DVD.  The other big time highlights on the DVD are \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" \\"Invincible\\" \\"Time is Running Out\\" \\"New Born\\" \\"Plug in Baby\\" \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"Take a Bow\\".  Each of these songs they play on the DVD sound amazing and they even add a little bonus at the end of \\"New Born\\", and \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\"    This is a terrific DVD/CD combo and should be purchased by any Muse fan.  My only complaint is that they should have put \\"Plug in Baby\\" on the cd instead of \\"Unintended\\" as it is a much better song and would fit better with the other songs on the CD.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|From the opening soliloquy admitting an alcoholic's obsession, to its conclusion in the sweltering bayou, this film version captures everything that has made millions of devoted fans for James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheax novels.  Tommie Lee Jones inhabits the soul Robicheax, a good man of faith haunted by a past of violence, racism and alcohol.  He fights his demons, but it is not clear whether he is winning his fights.<br /><br />The film drips with bayou heat and rumbling thunderstorms that summon the Confederate Dead from the Electric Mist.  Faulkner wrote of the south that \\"the past is not dead, its not even the past\\"  Such is true of Burke' characters, who live in a world of corruption, decption and power, trying to hide from their past, which always in one way or another, finds them.<br /><br />Who did it?  In one way or another, they all did.  In Dave Robicheax's world, no one is innocent, except maybe those who become victims.<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie that should have gone into theaters before going to DVD.  But we are fortunate this movie was made, and can only hope that despite whatever contract/production issues led to the movie going to DVD, that we'll see Tommie Lee Jones again as Dave Robicheaux.

Almost all Ice-cream Bases are madefrom Custard ingredients--> Eggs, Milk or Cream, Sugar, Vanilla, (I always add a pinch of Salt too, and really don't want to get into a debate about whether one should or shouldn't add Salt. I just do, and that's that, *lol*).<br /><br />When Heat is applied to this Custard Base, as through an oven, (in a Bain-Marie--> a water bath), you get what we all know as Custard, Flan, or Cr&egrave;me Brulee (Custard with the toasted sugar on top). If you apply Freezing Cold to the Custard Base, as with an Ice-cream maker, you get Ice-cream.<br /><br />Which brings us to the next word about Ben & Jerry's Sweet Cream Base #1. They use 2 Eggs, beaten, but they do not cook them; they just beat them with the Sugar and Cold Cream/Milk mixture, and then put in the fridge to chill until ready for the Ice-cream Maker.<br /><br />As for me, this is unacceptable, so, I cook these ingredients as a Custard like most all-other Ice-cream recipes do. It's not that I wouldn't trust eating Ben & Jerry's Ice-Cream from the store, for I do eat it, and LOVE IT! But, they are a Commercial Ice-cream Enterprise. Their freezers, refrigerators, and general coldness of their factory preparation, instills every confidence in me that the Ice-cream they sell is A-Okay.<br /><br />Alas, at home, I'm not so sure. And, since I have been a victim of Salmonella-poisoning, I just won't take chances. So, if you're worried about this too, it's really no problem.<br /><br />Here's the Method--><br /><br />Beat your Eggs for a couple of minutes. Then, beat in the Sugar, by thirds, until thick and creamy.<br /><br />Heat 1/2 of the Milk/Cream called-for in a saucepan on the stove to almost boiling/scalding. Then, with your beater beating the Egg mixture again, add the HOT Milk/Cream to the Eggs. This is called 'Tempering the Eggs'--> in essence, cooking them while you're beating them with the HOT Milk/Cream.<br /><br />(If you don't 'Temper the Eggs' first, but just add them to the HOT Milk/Cream on the stove, you will have scrambled Eggs in your Custard Base... yuk).<br /><br />Pour the HOT Milk/Cream/Egg mixture back into the saucepan, and put it back on the stove. Keep cooking it on LOW til thickened up a bit, whisking all the time. DO NOT WALK AWAY FROM THIS PROCEDURE, it goes pretty fast at this point. Keep your eye on it, and when you see the mixture beginning to come to a boil, take it off the heat, and whisk, whisk, whisk. Put it back on the stove and do it all again. I always do this a total of three (3) times. (I want those Eggs cooked! *lol*). All this only takes seconds to accomplish, certainly not more than a minute.<br /><br />Take the saucepan off the stove, whisk in the Vanilla or whatever flavouring you're using, and then pour the Custard into, preferably, a glass bowl that has a lid to it--> like a Pyrex storage bowl.<br /><br />Whisk in the other 1/2 of the COLD Milk/Cream called-for in your recipe. This should cool down the Custard enough to cover and place in the fridge. If not, you can let it set on the counter for a few minutes, just long enough to let the major heat of the Custard dissipate before putting in the fridge.<br /><br />If you're really in a hurry, you can always make an Ice-Bath. Take a bowl that is twice as large as the bowl your Custard is in. Put a whole bunch of ice cubes in it, and add some cold water from the tap, (ice water is colder than ice and will cool down your Custard right quick).<br /><br />Set the Custard bowl in the larger bowl, (if done right, the Custard bowl will be sitting somewhat on top of the ice, with the sides of the bowl submerged about halfway-up in ice-water. Be sure to keep a hold of the Custard bowl tho--> you don't want it sinking into the larger bowl and getting ice water in your Custard). Keep whisking the Custard to help dissipate the heat. It will cool very quickly in an Ice-Bath. Put the lid on, and place in the fridge til you're ready to make Ice-cream.<br /><br />Of course, to the above cooled-down Custard, (usually before putting in the fridge), you'll be adding the various flavours, mashed fruits, chocolate, etc. that is called-for in your recipe.<br /><br />Enjoy this wonderful book chock-full of recipes and ideas. For our family, 'Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream Book' has proved to be just the BEST!<br /><br />NB: The Ice-cream recipes in this book make a generous One (1) Quart; and, by generous, I mean about a Quart-and-a-half!

B000YGIIQI|3.0|I watch most everything that Ramsay does on TV, but this book only offers slightly more than you could get from hearing him talk or reading his Wikipedia entry.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|RedSabbath (Eric) put it best, read his review...      If you are just looking for the movies, this is for you.  It is literally a copy of the movie discs for each respective movie pressed on one side of the dvd.  If you are expecting lots of extras buy the more expensive collector's edition or shell out the money for the blu-ray series. I did not have any duplicates as some have complained, and there was not a single scratch on mine.  If you really only want the movies this is a great economical choice.
0132350882|5.0|Robert C. Martin, fondly know to many as \\"Uncle Bob,\\" was one of the 17 people involved in the creation of the Agile Manifesto and has been a strong proponent of writing clean code for many years. He's also a well known and respected speaker and is actively involved in the agile community.    In \\"Clean Code,\\" Uncle Bob not only shows you what clean code looks like and why it is important, but how to take existing code and make it cleaner. This last part is invaluable because you get to see step by step improvement, which makes doing it with your own code much easier.    \\"Clean Code\\" is organized into three parts. As it says in the introduction, part one \\"describes the principles, patterns and practices of writing clean code.\\" Part two contains \\"several case studies\\" showing how to apply the knowledge from part one to actual working code. Part three (which is a single chapter) lists the \\"heuristics and smells gathered while creating the case studies.\\"    While the author warns us that there will be lots of code to read and that there's hard work ahead - I have to say that I found it all worthwhile and I think you will too.    I found the book to be well written, and organized such that you can read it in small chunks - which is great for those of us who don't have large blocks of free time available.    The beginning of chapter one sums it up nicely: \\"You are reading this book for two reasons. First, you are a programmer. Second, you want to be a better programmer.\\"    If you are a professional developer, or aspire to being one, then you owe it to yourself, your team, and your clients to read this book and take it to heart.    [...]This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it!  Burk Hufnagel  Lead Software Architect
1847246761|4.0|Good story  but predicable. I had no problem figuring out what was going to happen much sooner than it did. That was kind of a drag. The story was a good story if not unbelievable and perhaps approximately 50 pages too long.
B000002UAC|5.0|\\"With the Beatles\\" finds the boys a little streamlined and thus a little less ravishing, but hardly less attractive.  Again, fourteen tracks of classic rock 'n' roll, which equal fourteen tracks of rollicking fun.  I especially like their cover of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" and George Harrison's \\"Don't Bother Me.\\"  They get points for fun, points for consistency, and points for rocking and rolling--even if it is a little too refined.
0739375954|5.0|Intriguing and a real page turner. I read this book after the movie was released and although I haven't seen the movie, i can totally see Kate Winslett as the female lead in the story. It is well written and really captures emotions and images of the era and people.
B000002UA9|5.0|\\"Please Please Me\\" remains one of rock's seminal recordings, timeless, raucous, and unparalleled for fun.  The covers are amazing, particularly Lennon doing \\"Anna (Go to Him)\\" and then tearing his throat out with their spectacular version of \\"Twist and Shout.\\"  The originals are even more astonishing; the bluesy bounce of \\"Love Me Do\\" is every bit as exhilarating as it was in '62.  These fourteen performances are priceless rock 'n' roll, the album itself an undeniable call to a time when rock was about having the time of your life.  Listening to this album almost fifty years later, the effect is every bit as empowering.
B001O2ZW1A|4.0|Nuance has always been the hallmark of Steven Wilson.   This album gives the full range of expression that we have come to expect, along with the flawless production, and musical creativity.   Albums like this simply must be listened to on good headphones while you have the time to absorb.    It is always difficult to compare SW to other artists, as he tends to have a unique take, but there is definitely an almost Syd Barret feel on \\"port rubicon\\".   I quite liked \\"only child\\" which is a more straightforward tune in song structure.   Tracks like \\"No Twilight within the Courts of the Sun\\" has a great crimson like Type A distortion with some very cool improv.    \\"venero par las hadas\\" clearly is a nod back to earlier work on albums like Metanoia, but a great tune in it's own right.        Tracks like \\"get all you deserve\\" are simply phenomenal.  Building from a simple lyrical line and melody into interweaving harmony into a full blown distortion wall of sound over a chugging 6/8 backbeat is quite cool (although I'm not sure it will sustain many listens)        My only complaint with SW is that he is a little too dark and nihilistic, but he has fully explored that territory artistically.  That being said, SW always delivers a release of complete artistic integrity, and Insurgentes is no exception.   Although not straying too far from the Steven Wilson comfort zone in structure, groove or lyrics, it still delivers a substantially good album that is significantly creative.
B000002UAO|5.0|At the time, their best record since their debut.  Now: one of the peaks of rock music.  There's never a dull moment--even the throwaway tongue-in-cheek ballad \\"Michelle\\" amuses.  The high points go beyond the classics, into pieces like Lennon's irresistibly groovy \\"The Word\\" (his first foray into abstract politics) or McCartney's sharp \\"I'm Looking Through You.\\"  The boys had matured, and their ambitions were rising to aim for levels no one could imagine; today, after the likes of \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\" \\"Revolver,\\" or the White Album, one still feels the frenetically-exciting anticipation for what was to come.  And after that, \\"Rubber Soul\\" is just as exhilarating as it was before.
0810970686|5.0|This third \\"Diary of A Wimpy Kid\\" is as charming and funny as the first two best-selling installments.  This series of fictional diaries is written from the perspective of eleven year old Greg Heffley.  He plaintively relates the joys and angst of middle school and being the middle child between teenage brother Roderick (founder and frontman of the band \\"Loded Diper\\") and toddler brother Manny.  The text appears as if hand printed in a notebook and contains frequent single panel cartoons throughout.  I'm much older than this book's target demographic but was still repeatedly \\"laughing out loud\\" while reading it. Recommended for both kids and adults.  The inside cover says that Volume 4 is coming.
0143038419|5.0|I love this book. We are all connected regardless of age, gender, race. background or economic states. We all want to achieve inner peace.

3551744084|5.0|Lawrance Bernabo, way to go with the super pretentious review! First of all, your analysis is spotty, and, second of all, you speak of subtextual themes as if its they are superficial ones. As a result of both of these issues, your writing appears unnecessary, pretentious, and haughty by design. Also, word to the wise; cut the Latin from your review title! Did you decide to use Latin for a reason or did you simply think it sounded good? Regardless, I don't know what's worse, the title being in Latin or the fact that you provide a translation in parentheses.    Let each reader come to his/her own meta-judgements and form his/her own meta-analysis of the given work. If you want to be helpful to other customers, write more cursory reviews. Inform other readers of your general opinions. Do not, on the other hand, write desperately cerebral and, to most readers, impenetrable reviews. What you have here is a piece of writing that benefits you alone. It does little to inform other Amazon customers. It's like an individual who enjoys the sound of his/her own voice but has little of use to say. And, after all, reviews are meant to be utilitarian.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I didn't jump on the DualShock 3 bandwagon for a long time because... well... we had 2 SixAxis already and some third party 'rumble' contraption that didn't really amount to much but they still added up to 3 controllers and we couldn't justify a fourth and a fifth. But, all good (and bad) things come to an end eventually and the initial SixAxis finally expired so we had no choice but to go for the DS3.<br /><br />To make the long story short: we are happy with it. It's the old SixAxis plus the vibrations. At this time, we get the DS3 to vibrate with most of the games we play. I'm playing Fallout 3 these days and it vibrates quite nicely when weapons are fired or when mines explode and the kids are busy with Little Big Planet and the DS3 is compatible with LBP too.<br /><br />For anyone who's not familiar with the PS3 controllers, their main features are:<br /><br />- rechargeable<br />- Bluetooth enabled<br />- motion sensitive<br />- support rumble and vibrations<br /><br />That's just about it. To me, the DS3 is the perfect game controller. I can't say that I really missed the rumble a lot but, now that it's here, I'm glad we have it.<br /><br />Happy gaming everyone. I love the DS3 and I love the PS3 a bit more because of it.
B001HY3BFE|4.0|This a brilliant,superb piece of musical work.I like most of the songs in this CD.I would describe it as hard heavy,good musicality under the solid guitar metallic sound and,in my opinion,this is a good CD for any person who likes metal,hard rock music.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This 2007 film has sat on my cable's TiVo unseen for months now, but when I got fifteen minutes into it today I wondered \\"What in the world took me so long?\\". Bottom line, this is one excellent all around modern-day musical. Not one bad link or singer in the bunch, Johnny Depp pulls another one out of Tim Burton's hat with this. Based on the classic tale and the modern Broadway musical, I was really taken by everyone involved. Helena Bonham Carter was a gimme in the vocal talent department, but who knew Depp would be that able to carry a tune, not to mention Sacha Baron Cohen (yeah, yeah \\"Borat\\"...let it go people...) matching his vocals as well. Each song dripped dark emotions and even though it too was very violent, as the story usually goes, that part of it didn't seem to overshadow the incredible songs and acting. However, it did seem to make my eyebrow raise to hear one of it's more memorable songs (forgive me as I don't currently know it's title) sounded very very similar in structure and tempo to, believe it or not, another classic musical tune \\"I Want It Now\\" as sung by character Veruca Salt in 1971's Willy Wonka (I bet you'll hear it next time you view it now). But this film had everything going for it, memorable tunes, eye-catching scenery, and well-performing stars. This is one DVD going on my immediate wish-list, I'm just sad I waited this long to find out.<br />(RedSabbath Rating [for Movie alone]:8.5/10)
B00005OBSD|4.0|In an early 2009 interview in Guitar Player magazine, Joe Bonamassa named Tons of Sobs as one of his top 5 blues albums - he wasn't even born when this came out, but he knows great music when he hears it.    Pop music benefitted in the 70's from blues artists like Fleetwood Mac and Paul Rodgers crossing over to create amazing hits.  But they earned their songwriting chops on albums like this - the foundation guitar licks, clean bass lines, and simple production values to let the music shine through.    This is \\"roots\\" music for blues artists today but with great beats and rock lines that anyone can relate to.  While I don't think you'll go wrong with any Free album, enjoy this one for great songs like The Hunter and Walk In My Shadow.  You won't be disappointed.
0143038419|5.0|I am an avid reader of all sorts of novels, but Eat, Pray, Love is easily one of my favorites.    If you're looking for a book to carry you through a transition or hard time--this is absolutely the book for you!  I read this book as I graduated from college, moved home, broke up with my boyfriend and struggled to find a career.  It was such a buoyant and moving book that it truly helped me through one of the most difficult transitions in my short life.    I highly recommend this to anyone who cares to read about travel, change, spirituality and adventure.  It is a wonderful book!!!
0812548094|4.0|Since I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, I was fairly quick to pick up this sequel, and see if Goodkind could maintain his excellent story.  In short, almost, but not quite.  Several things are improved upon from Wizard's First Rule, most notably dialogue and character interaction. I've finally been introduced to some secondary characters that are interesting. Chandalen and Gratch immediately come to mind.  The best way I can give a good idea of the plot without spoiling everything is to say that Richard and Kahlan are separated in this book, and most of the book follows one or the other at a time. Of the two, I preferred Kahlan's story, which mostly consisted of the beginning of a war with an Old World superpower called the Imperial Order. Richard's story, unfortunately, was bogged down with lousy characters, poor plot choices, Wheel of Time rip-offs, and meandering subplots. Stone of Tears would have been much better off if the sections with the Sisters of the Light were shortened, and that isn't the only problem here.  Though we see several new landmarks in the world, such as the Towers of Perdition(sp?), they are not added to the map, which remains the same way it did in Wizard's First Rule. The book is still derivative, only this time more of the Wheel of Time than of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. The violence and sexuality are more intense than Wizard's First Rule. (Apparently, Goodkind didn't think he made the world brutal enough, and decided to crank it up a notch.) Rape and violent deaths abound, often described in uncomfortable amounts of detail.  The new villain we are introduced to, the Keeper, is even worse than Darken Rahl. Evil for no other reason that he hates things that live and wants to snuff them out at any cost, and he is nothing beyond the sterotypical, devil-like Dark Lord. However, the plot against him is in the end less developed than even the subplots here, because Richard spends most of his time hanging out with the Sisters of the Light, andonly starts working against the Keeper towards the end of the book. Stone of Tears could have been a lot better if the war against the Keeper was more developed and remained the main point of the plot through the novel. Richard's quest in this book was rather boring, and amounted to little. He did a little training at the Palace, than off he went to hastily wrap up the plot.  A high point was we got the POV of Zedd, which was quite interesting, especially when he subtly interacts with Kahlan's story arc and neither of them know it. His reaction to Kahlan's decision earlier in the book was one of the novel's high points. However, I have to say that Zedd's story would have been improved if it had focused more on stopping the Keeper, rather than just having him deal with an anti-magic curse.  In conclusion, Stone of Tears was a good book that didn't quite match the previous quality of Wizard's First Rule, mostly because of poor plot choices on the part of the author.  3.5 stars
0783225482|3.0|Where is an anamorphic release for this film? Surround Sound? Hey, how about a Blu-ray release? This movie deserves far better treatment than this 4X3 Full Frame release. A family member of mine owns this and I love the film, but I won't buy it for myself until it gets the treatment it deserves. This is a classic Robert Zemeckis film! It deserves far better than what it got with this release.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|Australia, with Nicole Kidman, who givbes a great performace as do all the others, reminds one that epic heroines can be created once more by great dirctors. She becomes the reason for being in Australia, and like S. O\\"Hara in GWTW, she epitomizes the strength and purpose of the land, and her love of it in terms of her committments to a child and her Drover lover.    The sweep of Australia is like Stevens' Giant or the better parts of Cimmaron. It has bulk and color, e.g. the rich costumes for this fabulous ball, the fires, the explosions, the cattle drives to the edges of nowhere, reminiscent of Red River, Raintree County, How the West Was Won (the better sections), and those huge Samuel Bronston films, and many more, that give you breadth, dimensions beyond three, and a beautiful musical score to match it all.    Buy this DVD and enjoy it for many seasons and reasons.    Nicole is great as always!  P.S.  Many critics did not like it; it has, like GWTW and otehr epics, the racial issue,but more so,  and this is not sitting well with Americans.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|This album is what the losers from Cannibal Corpse dream they wish they could make. The lyrics are scary and Satanic and usually focus on the subjects of killing, obviously Satan, rape, bestiality and necrophilia. The music involves loud guitar riffs with insane solos and frightening cookie monsters vocals that Corpsegrinder wishes he could do. Don't be fooled by their \\"cute\\" appearance and tween fanbase, these boys are the future of death metal!
B00005JKG9|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies. the all star cast is fantastic, plus pacino and harris are great looking in this film,a movie i like to watch over and over.
B000063JZQ|5.0|What can I say....this is a great Macbeth. It's all good.    My favorite thing is Polanski's concept of the witches. They do much witchcraft but no magic. They act like Medieval witches we are told acted. They bury a severed hand with a dagger in it....and a battle takes place there. They hand Macbeth a beaker full of goop with psilocybin mushrooms floating on top and he hallucinates the 8 Kings. They chant and spit and hop and laugh at naked sabbats....it's great!    Speaking of nudity....  This seems to be a problem (along with the graphic murders) for those one and two star reviewers. None of this is gratuitous however. The blood is there, prompted by the script itself ( Who's have thought..... And it can never be washed away) and by the very environment and culture. The nudity is easily explained. Lady Macbeth sleeps nude and so when she sleepwalks....she's nude. Now in \\"reality\\" a queen might actually sleep in a bliaut or some kind of chemise, but her nudity is also symbolic. She is after all exposing herself and, for the 1st time in the play, being openly honest. I think it's perfectly justified. The witches are all naked because that's what supposedly happened at sabbats, as they raise a demon or the devil himself to have intercourse with (Like Rosemary's baby, y'know)    It's funny, I remember when the film came out the main complaint was Macbeth's and Lady Macbeth's age. \\"They're supposed to be middle aged!\\" my professors lamented. It says nothing about that in Shakespeare that I can find. And this image of youth tempted and run amok is the lesson from the Manson family Polanski wanted to get out there.
6304698690|5.0|A very good movie to have and keep, to share with your kids and grandkids. A simple but wonderful story.
6304698690|5.0|Well, actually it was Studley Royal in North Yorkshire. I have a photo of the window seat and the paned window that Mary sat at looking out over the grounds. It is beautiful! This movie captured the beauty of the English countryside, the moors and the garden. Although it had the darkness of the bonfire and the \\"spell\\" bringing Lord Craven home, the characters sprang from the book. The other movies have been wonderful also, and put them all together and you have a remarkable bringing to life of the story. My mom read the book to us when I was very young when my grandmother was dying of cancer (though we did not know it at the time) and the book and story bring me back to that special time with my mom in our play corner in the garage. That corner took us to the Treasure Island, and to England, and all kinds of other places. Read the book to your child, then show them the movie. Then if you are ever going to England, make Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal a definite stop on your trip.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I would say that \\"Amazing Grace,\\" is the best movie of 2007.  It is the story of William Wilberforce's struggle to end slavery in the British Parliament.    I cannot think anything that could have been to be done to improve this wonderful story. It has an almost perfect balance of drama and comedy. Michael Apted's direction could not have been better. I think that one of Apted's best decisions was in casting, there is not one weak link in this wonderful ensemble and they all give great performances. It is encouraging to know that Apted is currently slated to direct the upcoming \\"Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.\\"
B0011UBDTK|4.0|You alredy know how magnificent the series is, you dont need me telling you that. We both know you want to buy the complete series, But BEWARE: The photo doesnt allow us to see clearly, but that box is twice the size of a regular DVD box set, its 30cm tall. If you want to put the series on you stand along with your other DVDs, search for Sex and the City seasons 1-6 at amazon. You will get all seasons in the regular DVD boxes.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|i love these two actors, two of the best living legends around. this movie was kind of \\"bland\\" , but i enjoyed these two together. if you are a true pacino and de niro fan . you would still want this movie part of your movie collection.

Yes, this album doesn't offer anything new, but it's still just as enjoyable as their self titled or You Could Have It So Much Better.  Put it on, dance along, and forget about everything else for a while.
B001OBT3FC|2.0|This concert is everything the first reviewer said!! However, I have received 2 defective copies. Neither disc will allow me to play the Karajan bonus material which of course is essential to the disc. I have tried both discs on 2 Sony Blue Ray players- the 350 and the 550. I can only hope the manufacturer corrects the problem.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Serenity is an awesome movie. It is based on the original sci-fi series Firefly. I recommend ordering the Firefly series and watching it before the movie, even though the movie stands on it's own. Firefly is a wonderful character driven sci-fi series and the movie captures the characters beautifully. I guarantee if you watch Firefly and Serenity, you'll be a browncoat for life!
0393061310|5.0|If you ever wondered how did societies get where they are today and why did others not evolve as much as others, this is your book. It puts to rest any preconceived notions regarding inferior races, etc and gives us the logic on why certain societies flourished and others did not.  Highly informative but also well written and easy to read.

0132350882|5.0|While this book includes many things I already knew, such as the Law of Demeter, it touches on them in a thorough and interesting way. The examples are all in Java which, though not my primary programming language, carries many of the same benefits and pitfalls of any other OO language.    This book is also great motivation. Many of us know that we need to write cleaner code, but the pressure of our peers or of timelines often makes us forget - or at least ignore - that impulse, often to our own detriment. I have it on my desk as I've not yet finished it, but even when I have a day where I don't read out of it having it there serves as a reminder of what I should be doing.    If you want to make yourself a better programmer, this book will not disappoint.
0316017922|5.0|This book challenges the reader's assumptions about why some people \\"succeed\\" and others do not.  Like other books written by this author, you have to put aside traditional thinking and seriously consider that \\"he just might be right!\\"  This book should be required reading for parents,grandparents, and educators.

Its unfortunate that someone so intelligent could also be so naively idealistic.    The travels, the characters he comes across captivate the reader and make for a very enjoyable read. It's a wonder that a person that could befriend people so easily and develop such deep bonds could be at the same time so negative regarding people and society. Krakauer's comparison to his own somewhat reckless youth however gives us some clarity in regards to how it could happen.  I was also surprised that Sean Penn's movie adaptation did not stray too far from the book (so un-Hollywood in that regard)
1592289444|1.0|Although I really enjoyed reading this book, I was extremely disappointed to find out later that it was an unture story.  The BBC investigated this story several years ago and found it was false. I remember reading another book of fiction that was passed off as a true story entitled,\\"As Far As My Feet Will Carry Me, by Josef M. Bauer which was almost identical to this work or fiction. The title of this book should be changed so future readers will know it is fiction before they pay their money to purchase it.
006135323X|5.0|The field of \\"Behavioral Economics\\" is all the rage right now, and this is the second book I've read on that theme.  The first was the much more superficial (and therefore much more popular) \\"Freakonomics.\\"    \\"Predictably Irrational\\" is a far superior book.  Ariely describes some strikingly creative and imaginative psychological experiments that he and his colleagues and students have carried out.  Those experiments, not surprisingly, demonstrate that people often make decisions irrationally.  But Ariely goes farther in his (usually successful) attempts to define exact what the irrationality is, what its source is, and how it can be predicted to affect our behavior in other settings.    His conclusions have implications for politics, economics, family relationships, and life in general.  Fortunately, however, he treads very lightly when it comes to recommending governmental or social policies - possibly (hopefully?) because he sees no evidence that the government makes decisions any more rationally than a college-age male who's  viewing a pornographic video!  (That's the setting for one of his many interesting experiments.)    An excellent read.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was hooked on Turbo Jam for a few weeks, and it's a magnificent programme, but I was getting a bit bored of the endless \\"tucks\\" and Punch & kick routines. I bought Jillian's 30 day shred, and WOW!  This DVD is exceptional, the exercises are deceptively simple, but extremely effective. Jillian has developed 3 potent 20 min (approx) workouts that really work all the major muscle groups, and is perfect if u prefer \\"old school\\" drills and less dancy moves- jumping jacks, and jump rope are big players in these routines.   I'm an intermediate exerciser, and started @ level 2....propmtly switched to Level 1 mid way through the first circuit-what a humbling experience, but definitely worth it, I sweated 2x as much as I normally would for a 45 min aerobics class.   This DVD is a keeper. Jillian's cues were not the best, but the routines are not that complicated that after watching it once, you couldn't get the hang of it. I found the music to be just awful, and the moves aren't really in time to whatever rhythm there is so I play some high tempo soca/reggae/dance/latin while I work out, and voila, problem solved. Like I said before, it's perfect if you're not that co-ordinated or just don't like to dance. I've seen other comments about haveing to wait for 2 mins or so before the actual selection scene comes up, I've found once I play the DVD on my laptop that prob is eliminated. The workouts themseves are excellent, and once you exert the effort, you do get a very effective workout in about 20 mins. I would advise to do some additional stretches for the cooldown though, as with every other DVD, I personally find this portion to be under whelming.  If you want a low frills, high impact workout, get this DVD. It's worth it
0618918248|4.0|Dawkins provides a great deal of examples and history regarding the absurdity and hypocrisy of today's major religions.  His tone at times however seems a bit bitter.  I don't think it needs to be and I think in his own way he is on a crusade to convert everyone to his way of thinking.  Which seems to be one of his major complaints about the religious leaders. Despite this fault, the facts, logic, organization and storytelling make this a good read.
B000AU1Y9G|5.0|The reason I'm reviewing the 1950 MacMillan Publishing Company version is that this version is the one I have that is hardcover. There are many reasons why you should buy the book itself. The plot is rich and full of details (however if you read The Magician's Nephew first, much of the plot will be spoiled). The illustrations are absolutely wonderful. Also (though this is a reason why you should buy the 1950 one), having it in hardcover and textured really holds the book together, so you can expect to get many years out of it, if it has already lasted 59. This is the order in which you should read the books: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Prince Caspian, The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, The Silver Chair, The Horse and his Boy, The Magician's Newphew, and the Last Battle. By the way, if you're someone who absolutely loves the original order of the books, or even someone who prefers the chronological order, you'll notice there's just no way to change The Last Battle, with the \\"last\\" part of it in the title.

Thank You Michael Moore. All Americans should be treated equal. Health insurance falls short and affordable only if you have the money. I hope your film is used to move America closer to universal healthcare.  The government should learn from and adopt what other countries are doing.

B00004BZ0N|3.0|I just finished listening to London Calling for the first time straight through, and almost all of the tracks on the album were new to me. After looking at amazon.com's reviews, I realized that this album is quite beloved. There were about 353 five star reviews, and less than 40 or or so three star reviews or less.    So, good points about the album:    1. It is unique. The sound I heard has yet to be replicated in my mind, and only modern ska seems to come somewhat close. Surprisingly, the album doesn't sound like a punk stereotype, but at the same time, Joe Strummer's vocals sound distinctively punk, with some of his clever lyrics distinctly portraying his thick accent. (Or at least what sounds like an accent.)  2. The track listing (19 songs) is very long and should not allow anyone to doubt The Clash's ability to pump out legitimate songs with ease.  3. The instrumentation is experimental yet effective, and the band plays and sounds tight, almost like a jazz band.  4. Excellent production. Vocals always came out clearly, instruments the same.  5. Every track is solid. Some of the compositions are downright blasts. I couldn't find a weak song on the album. However, this is not to say that the album does not have some obvious weaknesses, in my mind.  6. Hey! Whoever their bassist is, he's good!  7. Cool cover art.    The weak points:    1. Many of the songs sound the same. Now, keep in mind, this is after a single listening in two sittings, but one of my first impressions was that this album has little variety in terms of \\"fast/slow,\\" \\"ballad/hard rock,\\" and many of the songs simply have the same feel. And while I like the vocalist, his range seems rather limited. He sounds similar on many of the tracks. In of itself none of these things are a problem, but as a whole the album seems to drag sometimes, and doesn't keep you interested as an overall work of art. \\"London Calling\\" took me places sometimes, but a few times I felt like I'd already been there.  2. The album lacks a coherent message/impression. After hearing an album, I usually walk away thinking about a particular thing, or in a particular mood. I heard \\"London Calling\\" and then got up and called my dad, not thinking about any of the lyrics or having a tune stuck in my head. Nothing seemed to stick with me.  3.\\" London Calling\\" just doesn't seem magical. It didn't lift me up. My ears weren't enraptured. I didn't feel eager to get to the next song, while wishing the current song would never end. Nothing in particular spoke to me.  4. It seems to lack greatness. It's unique. It's cool. It's produced well. Much of it's catchy. But it simply doesn't seem revolutionary. While I had never heard it before, I didn't feel like I 'discovered' anything in \\"London Calling.\\"    In reality, this album doesn't deserve as much criticism as I've given it, and I say that because of the overall quality of the work in of itself. But this album is on quite a pedestal, and to me the album plays a little bit more like a \\"Best of The Clash\\" or a \\"The Clash's Greatest Hits\\" rather than one of the best rock albums of all time, and I had to keep that in mind during this review. Many of the songs are awesome, but as an album, it doesn't seem to achieve something special. Maybe I didn't listen to it loudly enough. And I need to listen to it at least two more times before forming my concrete opinion. But I'm definitely buying it, and at least one or two other Clash albums. And lastly, please don't let the fact that I wrote so much about the negative mean that it's more negative than positive, it's just that when an album like \\"London Calling\\" is so strong, but at the same time lacks something that you can't put your finger on, it requires some thought in order to figure it all out. I suspect this album is going to grow on me, though.    Probably my favorite track was \\"Train in Vain,\\" next to \\"London Calling,\\" of course. Some other special ones: \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Rudy Can't Fail,\\" \\"Jimmy Jazz,\\" and \\"Lost in the Supermarket.\\" Oh, and \\"Clampdown.\\"    Precise rating: 7.3 out of 10 turtle shells.    ================================    My info/tastes:    Age: 21  Gender: Male  Places I've lived: New Jersey and Houston, Texas  My Main Influences: The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, The Who, The Beach Boys, The Doors, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, Jimi Hendrix, John Lennon, Metallica, Styx, Joy Division, Apollo Sunshine, Of Montreal, jazz artists, N.W.A., Eminem, Jay-z, Wu-Tang Clan, Lil' Wayne, Michael Jackson, Mozart, Bach, Beethoven.
B001KR0BDI|5.0|I started this book the morning of a volleyball tournament. I was hooked after the first few pages.

B001NFNFNA|4.0|I like this kind of story. \\"Hope can make someone strong\\".   The tension is build step by step, slowly but it's worth the wait.  There's nothing wrong with the story, setting, and soundtrack.  It's unite all together as harmony.    BUT i feel like Jolie is not match play as Collins, a struggle single mother who want to find her missing son.  Her acting, her body gesture, all of it. it's not natural.  I cannot catch how sad, desperate, angry she is supposed to be.     I wonder how it's gonna be a better film if played by Kate Winslet, or Jodie Foster, or Julia Robert.    I want to give 3.5 star but since there are not there, i give 4 star intead.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered 30 Day Shred based on other recommendations and I think it's great.  I highly recommend this for people who are beginning to lose weight or who are stuck in an exercise rut.  You get a decent workout in about 25 minutes and you can modify it to your level of fitness.      And the results - using this DVD and a low-calorie diet I am losing 2-3 lbs. a week.  As far as I'm concerned these are GREAT results, and are double what I would see with diet alone.  You will love this DVD!

B000N3T0DW|3.0|Volver is a restrained effort from this often flamboyant director. Unfortunately it's also one of his weakest. Uncharacteristically, Almodovar seems unsure both of himself and his themes and this is reflected in a rather flat and stunted script. None of the threads touched upon are developed enough to give the movie a true sense of direction. It is, however, redeemed somewhat by the performances. Penelope Cruz, in particular, is impressive. Overall a disappointment when compared to Almodovar's other work.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|OK, admit it. You love ABBA. I do too. I didn't realize how brilliant ABBA was until well into adulthood, but this Swedish quartet put out some of the most exciting, catchy, and brilliant music of all time.    Until I bought this box set, I was only familiar with ABBA through their greatest hits collections: ABBA Gold and More ABBA Gold. All of the songs of these collections are brilliant, but there is so much more to ABBA than just their hits. ABBA was not just disco. Their discography of music is surprisingly eclectic, and they could rock hard just as easily as they could light up the dance floor at Studio 54.     Every one of ABBA's albums, from their 1973 debut to their final album in 1981, The Visitors, is a masterpiece. Every song ABBA created could have been a hit. As many others have said, ABBA truly never released a song or album that wasn't good.     And it is through this box set that I discovered how much incredible music from ABBA is unknown. Wall of Sound? It's more like a Cube of Sound with ABBA. Every song is meticulously composed, arranged, and sung. And it's because of this perfection that ABBA's music, even the songs on their debut album, sounds like it could have been recorded yesterday. Here's a brief rundown of each album in this set:    Ring Ring (1973) - What a debut! Powerful, peppy, Europop. The title song is probably the best known song from this album, but every song is terrific. Another Town, Another Train and Rock & Roll Band are two fantastic songs that could have been hits but weren't. I also love Nina, Pretty Ballerina, a fun, slightly silly song about a woman who's all business by day, but performs for the masses on Friday nights, and People Need Love, the first song Benny, Bjorn, Agnetha, and Anni-Frid recorded together. And again, thanks to that brilliant ABBA craftsmanship, most of these songs don't sound nearly as dated as others of the time period.     Waterloo (1974) - Wanna know what ABBA's best album was? This was it, despite a lack of true hits. This is ABBA's most eclectic album. Waterloo, the title track, is again pure power Europop, with great sax and piano work. ABBA rocks hard with Watch Out (probably their heaviest song) and the super silly, but brilliantly composed King Kong Song. My Mama Said is a song that proves ABBA may have helped to invent disco. But the song is much funkier that the typical disco song, with a great bass line, and therefore it doesn't sound dated at all. Honey Honey is a lovely little romantic ditty with synth work that ABBA created with a synthesizer than they got from the future. The album closes with Suzy Hang Around, a beautiful folksy song about a girl who just want to hang out with the boys but gets rejected, and it's wonderfully sung by Benny. Every time I play this album, my jaw drops when I think about the fact that most of these songs were recorded in 1973! They don't sound dated at all. This is not the music you think of when you think of ABBA. And that's why I love this album the most.     ABBA (1975) - Now the hits start coming. This album starts off with one of ABBA's best known songs, Mamma Mia. Mamma Mia is followed by one of ABBA's heavier rockers, Hey Hey Helen. The fantastic love song S.O.S. is also on this album. The highlight among highlights on this album is the beyond astonishing Intermezzo No. 1. Twenty years before Trans-Siberian Orchestra started to bring a fusion of hard rock and classical music to the masses, ABBA did it with this nearly four minute magnum opus. Words cannot describe how brilliant this composition is. And it was recorded in 1975?!? I can't believe it, and neither will you. I would say that this album is tied with its successor as ABBA's second best.    Arrival (1976) - Yes, ABBA truly did arrive with this album, and it's another masterpiece. This album features more hits, including what is probably ABBA's best know song, Dancing Queen. This album also features the best breakup song of all time, Knowing Me, Knowing You. The album starts off with the super peppy When I Kissed the Teacher, a song about a girl who shocks her class when she does exactly what the title says she does. The terrific Money, Money, Money is also on this album. While not a big hit when it was originally released, it has morphed into a pop staple over the years.     The Album (1977) - While a hair less brilliant than the three albums that preceded it, The Album still shows ABBA as masters of their craft. This album starts off with the majestic Eagle, which is followed by another one of ABBA's best known songs, Take a Chance on Me. One Man, One Woman is a great romantic ballad. Hole in Your Soul is the best \\"Should Have Been a Hit, But Wasn't\\" song on this album. A super uptempo rocker with tremendous energy, it will have you singing along every time you hear it. The albums ends with a trio of Broadwayesque \\"mini-musical\\" songs, Thank You for the Music, I Wonder (Departure), and I'm a Marionette.     Voulez-Vous (1979) - Here it is, the \\"Disco\\" album. I would say that this is my least favorite ABBA album. It's still brilliant, but not quite as terrific as the albums that preceded it. The heavy disco influence makes the songs on this album sound a little more dated than the other albums. Still, ABBA's disco songs will blow any other group's out of the water, thanks to the brilliant composing and arranging. The highlights of this album are the title track and the fantastically playful Disco/Rock fusion song Does Your Mother Know.     Super Trouper (1980) - As the 70s morphed into the 80s, something happened to ABBA that happens to most of us: they grew up. Super Trouper showcases a more mature, more introspective ABBA. The music toned down the super happy Europop a bit and brought in some more adult contemporary elements. It was like Voulez-Vous was ABBA's giant party, and this album let everyone know that it was time to get serious. The album starts off with the terrific Super Trouper. Other highlights:Me and I, the new waveesque On and On and On, and the terrific medieval sounding The Piper. This album is a bit different from the others, but still great.     The Visitors (1981) - While the final albums of most groups often shown a notable decline in music quality, that's not the case here. The Visitors is a terrific swan song. Like its predecessor, the albums tends to be more serious in tone than ABBA's 70s albums. The album starts off with the sci-fi inspired The Visitors, a great song with the typical hooky ABBA chours. Two for the Price of One is ABBA's \\"fun\\" song on this album. The album does have a bit of a somber tone throughout, but the quality of the songs still does not disappoint.     This set also contains a bonus disc with many extra songs from all of ABBA's different eras. Included are Swedish version of Ring Ring and Waterloo and some early songs sung by Bjorn, including Santa Rosa and Merry Go Round. I particularly like the Medley: Pick a Bale of Cotton, On Top of Old Smokey, and Midnight Special, recorded around the time of ABBA's self-titled album in 1975.     The packaging of this set is super compact, and all of the CDs are housed in replicas of the original LP album covers. There is also a bonus book containing little tidbits and dates about many of ABBA's songs.     The sound of every one of the CDs is absolutely stellar. Benny and Bjorn must have put their magic touch on these CDs. Every note is crystal clear.     I cannot recommend this collection enough. ABBA's contributions to pop music and, in fact, to music in general, cannot be praised enough. Pick up this set and you will get the opportunity to enjoy some of the best pop, rock, and disco music ever created. Yes, indeed, ABBA, thank you for the music.

B000EYK2GE|5.0|This is an amazing live rockabilly set by the king of rockabilly, Carl Perkins. I purchased the VHS of this show when it originally came out in 1986. I have since purchased the dvd and I had to have the cd since the music is so rockin'. Carl is accompanied by a slew of stellar performers on this cd. George Harrison, Ringo Starr, Dave Edmunds, Eric Clapton, Slim Jim Phantom, Lee Rocker, Earl Slick, and Rosanne Cash. I believe that Carl has never sounded better. His voice had greatly matured and he shows it on his own country & western classic \\"Turn Around. He rocks on \\"Put Your Cat Clothes On\\". It's by far his best version. I can't leave out \\"Boppin' the Blues\\" and \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\". The sound quality all throughout the cd is excellent. If you are a Carl Perkins fan like myself, then your music collection shouldn't be without this one.
B0011UF79C|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A fascinating and insightful look at the future with exceptional production design and fine acting (aside from Miss Thurman), Gattaca is both a thought-provoking view of a dystopian future and a nail-bitingly tense thriller which holds a well-deserved place on my shelf and should be on yours too.
B000059LGC|2.0|The 2-star rating which was given by the channel on which I saw this movie is surprisingly fair. I thought it was odd that a film with such a star-studded cast only received two stars. How could so many big names (nearly the entire cast) commit to a project so average? Peter Ustinov plays the great detective but occasionally slips out of his fake foreign accent. The director let it go. He does okay, overall, but it's nothing special or memorable. The movie moves along but most of it is so ho-hum. I don't recall any music used to influence mood and increase tension. The whodunnit murder mystery genre is so overdone, and this one has the tired cliche of 'anyone could have done it because everyone had a motive.' It's disappointing that it's such a low-budget movie. (Did they spend the entire budget on salaries?) They get off the boat only once, to see some ancient ruins, and the rest of the time they're all couped up on the boat. The set is dull. We don't even get to see any scenery despite the whole movie being filmed on location. The cinematography rating is zero stars. The closeups of dead people are gratuitous and unnecessary; they ruin it for young children. The ending of this old flick is nasty and you can't really walk away from it feeling satisfied like you do with many films. You realize at the end that in many respects Death on the Nile is better suited as a play instead of a movie. I thought the director tried too hard to make this such a clever plot you'd never suspect who committed the murders. Nearly half the cast getting bumped off virtually makes it a parody of the genre.
B000274THQ|4.0|The Kerners are a happy family. Alex (Daniel Br&uuml;hl) has grown up in East Germany without his father for years; he moved to the west for another woman when the children were very young. After that Alex and his sister Ariane (Maria Simon) have taken care of their mother (Katrin Sa&szlig;), a teacher for the DDR. When she succumbs to a heart attack, she falls into a coma for eight months and misses the fall of the Berlin wall and all of the changes that come with it. When she wakes, the doctors warn that any shock could cause another heart attack and kill her, so Alex and Ariane do their best to create life before the fall of the wall. It is not easy, and their deception is intricate and time consuming.<br /><br />This film plays out like a typical Hollywood movie, so the language barrier is the only thing that would make this movie less popular among American audiences. The story is well played by all of the actors, especially Sa&szlig; who alternates between confusion and tranqulity very well. She is the anchor holding everything together. If you're looking for a good movie that alternates between comedy and drama with historical ties, Good-bye Lenin is an excellent choice.

Daniel Suarez is an insider (he consults with new media, the entertainment biz, the military and the government on technology/security issues) with enough technical acumen to make Daemon the most exciting cyber thriller of this decade.  Forget William Gibson, this guy is as good as Neal Stephenson in his earlier days -- perhaps better.    The implications of identity theft, information distortion and the nefarious application of new technology are haunting in this daring novel.    It helps to have some understanding of online gaming and its concomitant culture, distributed networks and computer programs, but it's not necessary to appreciate this wild ride.

The cast is excellent as well as the subject matter, but many scenes have very uninspired dialogue. The film is also a bit long and that might not have mattered if the dialogue was better throughout. it's a good film worth seeing, but it's not as great as some reviewers would want you to believe.
B000YENUI6|4.0|The Bottom Line:    Naomi Watts is annoying bushy-tailed and the central mystery is a bit of an old hat, but Viggo Mortensen is electric, dominating every scene he's in and drawing in the viewers even when the script doesn't match his brilliance--throw in one of the best fight scenes ever staged on film (seriously) and there are plenty of reasons to watch this uneven but entertaining movie.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Forgive me for not being familiar with the comic book \\"Ironman\\" - I've only put a toe in the graphic novel pool and I've flat-out missed this one.      So perhaps my rave review of this comic book adaptation is somewhat uninformed.  But given the fact that the filmmakers went for a PG-13 blockbuster approach, it's hard to imagine how director Jon Favreau (no, not President Obama's speechwriter, but the guy from \\"Swingers\\" and \\"Elf\\") could have given us a more polished, pitch-perfect movie.    Start with a clever and detailed \\"birth of Ironman\\" story, a pretty funny script, and a wonderful ensemble of top-notch actors, and you've got a great cocktail.  As has been widely commented, the movie starts and stops with Robert Downey Jr.'s stellar performance as genius weapon-designer Tony Stark.  Poking gentle fun at Downey's sordid past, \\"Ironman\\" provides a fresh perspective on the superhero - Stark is one cool dude.     Surrounding him are Gwyneth Paltrow as secretary/love interest Pepper Potts, Terrence Howard as sidekick and straight man Rhodey, and Jeff Bridges as the bombastic Obadiah Stane (the name should give you some clues).  These gifted actors breathe life into characters that not only shine in the big scenes but also in the quiet, more mundane moments in the movie.    I won't bother recapping the plot - it's pretty by-the-numbers fare - but strongly recommend enjoying this movie for its attention to detail.  Virtually every scene has something to recommend it, which isn't always the case with comic book adaptations because there's often so much darn exposition and backstory.  The first half of the movie shows the birth of Ironman in perhaps the most entertaining form of all - a birth of necessity.  You're so captivated by the character of Stark that you find yourself ignoring the top-notch special effects and how the movie - for all its violence - stays safely on the PG side without descending into \\"Phantom Menace\\" cartoonishness.    An excellent film that has given birth to a new franchising juggernaut (\\"Ironman 2\\" and \\"Ironman 3\\" are already in pre-production), \\"Ironman\\" is a guilt pleasure without the guilt.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Good set of a great game for all ages.  Says it can be played by two people, but my 6 and 9 year old got the hang of it pretty fast and unless three or, better, four colors are used both of them always finish / get all their pieces out, diminishing the challenge and fun.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Once we get past the lengthy travelogue and setup, the remainder of the movie is a snap to predict.  In fact, it is a wide screen, color version of a 1930s western.    A hoity toity English lady (Nicole Kidman) goes to Australia in 1938 to dispose of a cattle station (ranch) that is not profitable.  She meets a scruffy cattle drover (Hugh Jackman) and discovers that her husband has just died at the rundown station. And, oh, there's a cute, ragged, intelligent Aborigine boy who loses his mother.  Soon they all set out with a herd of cattle to sell at the port to save the station from an unscrupulous rival rancher.  I suspect that most anyone can write the rest of what happens.    Kidman looks aristocratic, then sweaty.  Jackman looks sweaty, then shaven and presentable.  They recite their lines without much interest, but that's OK, because the lines aren't very interesting.  The only thing worthwhile is the scenery of a barren outback that doesn't look as if it could support one cow, much less a herd.    Avoid this one.  See it only if you must.
B001HN6972|4.0|\\"The Reader\\" is a thoroughly captivating and engrossing film.  Two hours speed by as the viewer is transported to post war Germany and the steamy affair between Michael Berg, a boy of fifteen, and Hanna Schmitz, a woman of twice his age.  We then see the story move between a series of time line changes that serve to fit in the various missing pieces until the film's conclusion in 1995.<br />Schmitz is played by Kate Winslet who deservedly won an Oscar for her role.  She is totally believable as the woman with the sordid pass.  Indeed, as the film reveals in due course, she was a member of the SS and is brought before a tribunal charged with mass murder.  This trial has a huge impact on Michael Berg who, by this time, is a law student studying the case.  He is confronted with his own past.  His first lover is there before him charged with the most heinous of crimes.  He is torn between trying to forget his own past and the compulsion to help the woman.  He chooses the former and Schmitz is jailed for life.  Berg is distraught.  Has he chosen the right course?<br />There are some critics who believe \\"The Reader\\" glamorises perpetrators of the Jewish holocaust.  This view is mistaken.  The holocaust was obviously a great and evil crime.  Yet, in its wake, it created stories with their own inherent dramas.  This is one of those cases.  It does not seek to relieve the guilty of blame.  It simply tells a story of those involved.  \\"The Reader\\" does this magnificently.<br />My recommendation to critics is simple.  Go see this film.  It is symptomatic of an event that resonates to this day.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love the movie and my kids love it too. Definitely my favorite of all Miyazaki's movies.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This movie was so difficult to watch! It was a story I had not heard before so went to the theater blind to see it.  What went on to happen was unexpected and heart wrenching. Angelina Jolie's performance was phenomenal. She made this movie what it is. Without her emotion and reverence throughout the movie it wouldn't have been half as moving as it was.<br /><br />The film was exceptionally well written and equally well shot and directed. The imagery was moving and the shots epic.<br /><br />Watch this movie.
0803730098|5.0|My kids are never quiet except when reading especially this book.  They want me to read it over and over again.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|The story was amazing. I have never seen anything like it. I saw it originally at an art house theater, expecting a really artsy film. Its a movie that anyone and everyone can enjoy. Its impossible to turn away from the screen, its exciting and you will spend a lot of the movie laughing out loud one minute, then on the edge of your seat the next.
0803731094|5.0|My three kids (4 , 4, and 2 yrs old) love this book.  It is a clever book!
B001SKB1Y0|5.0|This film was excellent. I loved the pacing of the story, as well as the unpredictability of it. I was left guessing for the majority of the movie and loved every minute of it. The characters were relatable, the emotions were believable and the stories pulled from the diaries of women all over the world. Beautifully shot, it gives some amazing views of Spain. Rent it!
0375826726|1.0|The only reason to read this book is if you read the first two. Christopher Paolino needs to take a few good English courses and learn that yes description is good, but there is something to be said for too much.  This story could have been told in far less pages, with far less figurative language.  When you go too far and pass from beautifully written descriptive writing (like Wilson Rawl or JRR Tolkien) to just too much... it becomes a boring read.  This trilogy should have been just that... a trilogy... What started off as a great story, with wonderfully real characters has become a wordy mess.  Do us a favor Chris- go back to what you do best, weave a story.  Don't try to be something you're not.

1593072937|5.0|The Hard Goodbye is the passport to Miller Mythology.  It's a blueprint for the series.  Frank Miller taps right into human storytelling-consciousness and so this effort is immediately classic and iconic.<br /><br />If you enjoy pulp, legend, or hero stories you will love The Hard Goodbye.<br /><br />As an afterthought, however, this isn't kiddie fare and is not for the easily offended.  It is graphic in the manner that any medieval tale pictorially presented would be.  Brutal and honest with a dash of metered gore.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I opened my Dark Knight thrilled to find a digital copy code for online downloading,only to be disappointed that it cost $1.99 and is only compatible with Windows Media player.<br />Boooo to Warner Brothers for trying to force me to spend more money on the \\"Special Edition\\" that I do not want.

B00127RAJY|5.0|After gaining 15 pounds due to a herniated disc and taking a year to recover, I was desperate to get back into shape.  I had lost about ten of the extra fifteen pounds on my own, but the last five pounds and the flabby body from a year of no exercise was depressing me.      I found this DVD and had never even heard of Jillian Michaels (I haven't had a tv for four years, which is why I probably have time to exercise in the first place!)  Anyway, I started doing the 30-day shred and in two weeks I could see a difference.  I have done it faithfully now for about three months and my body looks great!  I'm toned, I have a waist again, my thighs and arms look sexy.  I'm 37 by the way, so I haven't had a body like this in at least a decade.    Some people don't like Jill and of course it's personal preference, but I like her \\"attitude\\" and I find her very encouraging through the whole video.  The video has three levels and you work your way up to level three.  Some of the exercises are challenging for my back so I substitute an equivalent low-impact and keep going.  Now I alternate between the three levels every morning.  I make the level 1 workout a little harder by adding more weight, but it's still a darn good workout even though I am on level three! So I get up early, do the workout, shower and I am ready to take on the day, knowing I got my workout done!    If you stick to it and eat a little healthier, you WILL get results!
0940985691|5.0|I don't believe in astrology. Or rather, I'm skeptically agnostic. However; as someone deeply interested in Indian culture, religion and philosophy, the time had come to get a book on Jyotish. I'm not disappointed in my selection, even if it at times it was like reading a manual on Quantum Physics. I knew I didn't want a bubble gum book, but something that would treat the subject seriously. Unfortunately for me, my eyes started glazing over at times (I have had no considerable background in Western astrology either). I can deal with Vedanta and highly abstract Hindu ideas, but the detail in this book was quite overwhelming in its complexity to sort out for a neophyte like myself. Nevertheless, if you want a reference book to read through and stick on your India shelf for later use, this seems more than just fine. I could of used more visual aids, but I trust their information to be sound and of the utmost integrity to the tradition (and their respective ishta devatas). So for that I have not punished them for my own lack of insight, and given it five stars.    As far as Svoboda goes though, I still prefer his Aghori books!
B001IZZEEI|5.0|Much like the movie itself, this special collector's edition of 'Sex and the City' is made for the fans who love and care about the show, the movie, and these women.  It's a beautiful set that contains the unrated version of the film (fans will enjoy the extra scenes that have seamlessly been added to the theatrical cut), special features on the first disc is commentary by writer and director Michael Patrick King.  King does great commentary on the film, much like he did on selected episodes of the series on DVD.  It's interesting to listen to him and exactly how much thought and care went into every aspect of telling these women's story.   Disc two contains an abundant collection of special features.  Fan no doubt will love the featurette on the costumes in the film and interview with legendary costume designer, Patricia Field.  There are also featurette's about the making of the film and the women of 'Sex and the City' among others.  Multiple deleted scenes are another added bonus on the second disc of the set.    Disc three of the set contains more features.  There's one featurette about the 'Vogue' photo shoot from the film, another about the party to celebrate the DVD release of the film, however, the highlight of this third disc is a conversation between Sarah Jessica Parker and Michael Patrick King about the making of the film.  It's fun to not only hear his thoughts, but Parker's as well and you'll be amazed by just how hands on she was in the making of this film and how obviously important it was for her to tell a story that will make the fans happy.  Disc four is a CD containing music from or inspired by the series.  It's a cute little added, bonus, but not one that is integral to this collection.  Overall, fans will be very happy with this set, but be warned, if you're not a hardcore fan of the series this set will just seem frivolous and a waste of money.  It's best reserved for collectors and for people who can appreciate the added features.

Plus, you can't beat the price!
0307269191|5.0|If you are a big fan of Murakami work, you will enjoy this book on human endurance mental and physical as the author inflicts upon himself some of the toughest sports to compete in at any age! From author, translator, long distance runner to ultra-marathoner to triathlete- Murakami takes you on his journey from the east cost of United States to the northern point in Japan. Along the way you feel his pain and frustration with his body and the affects of long distance events have on the body and mind.
045122499X|3.0|Almost 500 passionate reviews have been written, so what can I add?<br /><br />Pillars of the Earth is a pillar of a tale, and though it can't be called true historical fiction, I enjoyed it tremendously and learned a lot about Medieval times. Pillars is comparable with Clavell's Asian yarn, Shogun, but I suspect that World Without End falls short of those marks and will not win the enduring fame of either.<br /><br />Let me put it another way: I could recommend Pillars to anyone interested in a long story taking place in Medieval times, but I could not recommend World Without End. I suppose you'd like me to say why.<br /><br />First, World Without End annoyed me because too much of it is based on the \\"good\\" characters facing and overcoming one obstacle after another. This literary device is fine but gets old in a story running over a thousand pages. Imagine watching a forty-hour-long cartoon of the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote, broken up into one hour segments! That is exactly what this story feels like.<br /><br />Second, there is just too much modern sensibility in the story, including feminism, medicine, science, religion, and politics. The \\"good\\" characters may as well have been time travelers from the 21st century. Granted, there is some of that in Pillars, but not as much.<br /><br />Third, World Without End has more sex than Pillars. My friends who have read the book assume that the publisher asked Follett to include more sex, to bolster sales. I'm not so sure. I hope that Follett included it because it more or less accurately reflects how people thought and behaved in that time and place. If that is the case, then I don't mind it at all, but if it is gratuitous, then phooey on it!<br /><br />As sequels go World Without End is not the disaster that Scarlett was for GWTW. At least it's written by the same author. I don't regret reading World Without End, because I still learned many things, and it's a decent adventure story. But if you're choosing between the two, go for Pillars.
B0018M6J90|5.0|This movie was a surprise, and so great.  I've loaned it out to a number of people who have needed up beat darling movies to get them out of a funk.  This is it.   Terrific.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I own the 1990 CD release of this album and recently purchased both the 2008 release and the 2006 deluxe edition (SACD).  There are subtle, yet noticeable differences between all of them and this one (Oct 2008 release) has become my favorite for casual listening.  It offers increased clarity over the older CD release.  The SACD version is cool in its own right for bringing an amount of surround sound experience to an album recorded before its existence.  However, the SACD suffers from a lack of a center channel.  The lead vocals are usually heard on the front channels and backing/background vocals are heard typically on the rear channels.  My only complaint about the SACD version is the vocals.  I wouldn't say that the mixing of the vocals is better or worse than the original CD release, just very different.  Which takes some getting used to.    With that said, this is an absolute masterpiece and deserves the attention from all fans of progressive rock and contemporary orchestral movements.  There are thematic elements that flow throughout the entire piece and tie it together nicely.  It is really meant to be heard from start to finish and not one piece at a time.    This is subjective but my experience with this album is that the sounds communicate very well their intended purpose within the piece.  The album is based on the day in the life of being human with lyrics that span from dawn to dusk following activities and thoughts that apply to many people.  In addition, I believe it speaks to growing old as there are many passages that spark thoughts of nostalgia, growing old, and experiencing life.  The orchestral segments really dial in the time of day if you are one who likes to link sounds with objects, environments, and actions.

0618918248|5.0|I am 21 now, but as a child and teenager my parents took me to church every Sunday.  I finally told them that I was sick of church and stopped going regularly when I was 16.  I was tired of the same worn lines of the preachers and also how ludicrous some of the stories of the Bible are.  Anyways, after a couple years in college, I really started to doubt the existence of a God at all.  Then I read this book and now the deal is sealed.  I don't believe in any God and have no problem telling people I am an atheist.    Dawking's does an excellent job of explaining the doubts we all have.  I would recommend to book to anyone.  If you have any doubts about the existence of God, this book will be helpful.  If you are one of the (delusional) faithful, this book will test how faithful you really are.  I would guess that many of the faithful are scared to read this book though :).
B000ZI8E5K|5.0|It's the \\"all-time classic\\" of positive thinking, to me.   The POSM must be in the shelves of anyone who believes in this kind of issue. To those who do not believe it, a trial reading or listening to such a hit, will probably uncover the doubts and will be able to experience the fantastic changes ( or \\"miracles\\" ) the ultimatelly occur when we change our way of thinking the way we are taught to do.

B000050FEN|5.0|Fantastic DVD.  Highly recommended.    The first disc is the movie itself and the commentary by Director David Fincher, Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman.  The second disc is a bunch of fun cool deleted scenes/alternate ending (not actually an alternate ending just filmed differently). It also has a few extras like how they came up with the books and how they came up with the opening credits.      Great movie and fantastic packaging.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|soldier, twinkle, master teacher (!!!), that hump, telephone and honey are among the best badu tracks ever. that's a lot for 1 album. its ludicrous to award new amerykah less than 4 stars.    it has those raw bits that make baduism so good and genius production that make worldwide underground what it is. some bits get too silly with the sound effects and the tweaked voices, but they are more like skits rather than track spoilers like the voices over J Dilla's 'the shinning.' :(    the intro to honey is a bit annoying too. erykah pretends to be some sort of radio host or airport announcer. then she screws up the countdown to honey '...4, 3, 2, 2 1/2... 1. thank you.' 2 1/2 after 2?? maybe she should stick to what she does best: write, sing, groove and dope as can be :)
B001TODCII|5.0|\\"Taken\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Former government operative Bryan Mills begins the longest 96-hours of his life--and the hunt for the fearsome organization that has taken his daughter Kim. Mills had only recently given up his government career as what he calls a 'preventer' to be near Kim, who lives with Bryan's ex-wife Lenore and her new husband. To make ends meet, Bryan joins some former colleagues for special security details (like guarding a pop diva), but most of his time and energy are spent re-connecting with Kim. Bryan's familial goal is nearly derailed when Kim requests his permission to spend time in Paris with a friend. All too aware of the dangers that could lie ahead for Kim in a foreign land, Bryan says no, but Kim's disappointment leads him to very reluctantly relent. Bryan's worst fears are realized when Kim and her friend Amanda are suddenly abducted--in broad daylight--from the Paris apartment at which they've just arrived. Moments before Kim is dragged away by the as yet unseen and unknown assailants, she manages to phone Bryan, who begins to expertly piece together clues that will take him to the darkness of Paris' underworld, and to the City of Lights' plushest mansions. He will face nightmares worse than anything he experienced in black ops--and let nothing and no one stop him from saving his daughter.    The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Bryan) is great! The directing by Pierre Morel (who also directed \\"District 13\\" (2004) & the upcoming \\"From Paris With Love\\" (2009) is great! The story and screenplay by Luc Besson (who also produced) (who also produced the upcoming \\"From Paris With Love\\") & Robert Mark Kamen (both who also wrote the stories and screenplays to \\"The Transporter 1, 2, & 3\\" (2002, 2005, & 2008), also co-wrote the screenplay to \\"The Fifth Element\\" (1997, with Besson, who also directed), also co-wrote the screenplay to \\"Kiss Of The Dragon\\" (2001, with Besson, who also produced) is great!    The music by Nathaniel Mechaly is great! The cinematography by Michel Abramowicz (who also did the cinematography to the upcoming \\"From Paris With Love\\") is great! The film editing by Frédéric Thoraval (who also did the film editing to \\"District 13\\", \\"Angel-A\\" (2005, which Besson also wrote, produced, and directed), & the upcoming \\"From Paris With Love\\") is great! The casting by Ferne Cassel (who also did the casting to \\"Monster\\" (2003) & Nathalie Cheron (who also did the casting to \\"The Transporter\\") is great!

The art direction by Gilles Boillot (who also did the art direction to the upcoming \\"Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard\\" & \\"Arthur And The Two Worlds War\\" (both which Besson directed, produced, and co-wrote the screenplays) & Nanci Roberts is great! The costume design by Olivier Bériot (who also did the costume design to \\"Unleashed\\" (2005, which Besson also produced and wrote), \\"Arthur And The Invisibles\\", the upcoming \\"Arthur And The Revenge Of Maltazard\\" & \\"Arthur And The Two Worlds War\\", & \\"The Transporter 3\\") is great!    This is an great action-thriller that keeps you thinking and your heart racing. This is an excellent role for Liam Neeson. One of Luc Besson's best movies of his career, produced and story wise. This is one of the best action films of the new year.

B001TCNSOI|5.0|As a suspense movie, Changeling is mostly successful. As a movie about the ability of a few remarkable individuals to change history, it is more than successful; it excels. Staring Angelina Jolie and directed by Clint Eastwood, this is a film whose cumulative message about justice overcoming corrupt systems of power is both moving and persuasive. However, the message of the film isn't delivered like a heavy-handed morality play, but through an emotionally evocative performance by Jolie, as well her supporting cast. The fact that the story on which the film is based is true is icing on the cake.<br /><br />Jolie is Christine Collins, a single, working mother who is devoted to her son. Arriving home from work to find him missing, she contacts the LAPD and spends the next few months in a desperate search for her boy. When the LAPD announces they have found him and he is delivered to her via train, she quickly realizes that the boy they've brought is not hers, despite his and the entire police force's insistence that he is. The rest of the film is about her fight for answers from corrupt and pompous police officials, politicians, and doctors. Harrowing, sad, and at times disturbing, her pursuit of the truth is heart wrenching.<br /><br />One of the elements that really makes this movie as good as it is are the excellent performances turned in the the supporting cast. Especially worth mentioning are John Malkovitch as the Reverend Briegleb, a crusading Presbyterian pastor who uses his daily radio show to speak truth to power, and Michael Kelly as Detective Ybarra, seemingly the only honest police officer in the LAPD. Kelly does a fantastic job portraying both hardness and compassion in equal measure. There are scenes where he really makes the shot, such as the moment when he gently comforts a young boy in one of the most gripping moments in the film. Malkovitch is of course outstanding, and he steals most of the shots he appears in, conveying righteous anger without religious fervor, a very nice change from the typical cliches assigned members of the clergy.<br /><br />The period pieces and art direction are all very well done, which is typical of Eastwood who is having a good year with the success of Gran Torino and this film. The interiors of the police station, hospital, and courtroom all feel spot on, and contribute to making this movie immersive on more than an emotional level.<br /><br />A few caveats I had with the film were surrounding its length and the use of dialogue. Eastwood normally doesn't have many waste shots in his films, but I thought there were a number of times that the momentum slowed unnecessarily. I think the movie could have lost 20 minutes or so and been even stronger. I also feel that some of the dialogue was a bit forced or over done, especially some of the scenes that takes place in the hospital and then later in the courtroom. However these minor complaints do little to mar this excellent film.<br /><br />4.5/5 Stars. Stands with [[ASIN:B000Q8QH0I L.A.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|This was a sweet, charming and moving story. Beatrix Potter's quiet strength in pursuing her goals and dreams was commendable, especially in a time when women were so constrained. It was laudable that she never mistook aggressivity for strength, because she knew her own mind and that what she was doing was NOT wrong. It was a mistake to cast an American as Beatrix Potter. Silly and arrogant. Renée Z. did her best but it didn't quite work. I don't think anyone really believes her memorized phonetic accent. As so many others have commented, all we heard and saw was Bridget Jones, sigh.     Another thing the producers overlooked was the opportunity to include a great true event in Beatrix's life: when she was quarreling with her parents over her wish to get married, her brother came home and defended her. He told their parents \\"Why shouldn't Beatrix get married? I've been married for years!\\" He had to sneak off and get married secretly himself because he knew how unreasonable they were. That scene would have made a great addition to the film.     Otherwise, a thoroughly enjoyable film and it is highly recommended for those of us who yearn for quieter, gentler, more romantic times. Yes, life really was like that once upon a time, when people were mannered and cultured and had high morals. Sigh.

B00197YZ7M|5.0|Last night my wife and I watched this movie in \\"HI-DEFINITION\\" for the first time. Such glorious cinematography -- the countryside around the bridges of Madison county. \\"Beautiful music,\\" said my wife.  \\"I think Clint wrote it,\\" I said.<br /><br />Two nights earlier we had watched Clint Eastwood parry gracefully  (that \\"ah shucks\\" style of his) with David Letterman, who asked him his age.<br /><br />\\"I'm 78,\\" said Clint.<br /><br />\\"Now, I look 78!\\" said Letterman, only half-jokingly, \\"YOU look about 58!\\" The simple truth: Clint looks (to our eyes) as young as he did playing \\"Robert Kincaid, photographer\\" to Meryl Streep's \\"Francesca Johnson\\" Iowa farm wife, in this wonderful film, now 14 years old (1995).<br /><br />So I came here in search of a 2-Disc \\"Special Edition\\" and -- lo and behold!<br /><br />For those of us who love this movie, it seems incredible that \\"Bridges\\" didn't win a single award (though Meryl Streep was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" Oscar). This understated gem, masterfully directed by Clint Eastwood, remains my favorite of his films . . . actually affording Clint the vehicle for his very best acting; elicited, perhaps, by rising to the occasion -- having to 'act upwards' in the presence of the greatest actor/actress -- and deservedly the \\"most-nominated.\\" (Did they say Meryl now had \\"15 nominations\\" when singing her praises at the Oscars, a week ago?)<br /><br />-----<br /><br />The subtleties of Meryl's reading of  an Italian-born mid-westerner \\"Francesca Johnson\\"  grow ever-more-poignant, as the movie nears its end. We share her `heart-torn-in-two' agony at that moment, in the pouring rain, when her lover's battered, old green (59 GMC) half-ton is stopped ahead of them, at the light, directly in front of their red, (58 Chev) pickup truck.<br /><br />As if sending one final signal to the \\"love that comes but once\\" to their lives -- one last, unspoken urging to \\"run away with me NOW!\\" . . . we share Francesca's view as Robert reaches into the glove compartment, then drapes that silver crucifix & chain on his rear view mirror.<br /><br />Francesca inches her hand to the door handle, preparing to bolt and join her `one true love'  . . .  fatally delaying her move to the last possible moment. Her husband, noting the license plate on the truck ahead of him says, \\"That fella's far from home - Washington State! Must be that photographer everyone's been talking about.\\"<br /><br />Francesca's hand actually moves the door handle slightly. Her husband tentatively honks his horn because the light is green and asks, quietly, `Why is he not moving?' Soon the  truck ahead turns left, the driver's rain-soaked hair evident through his still rolled-down, window.<br /><br />They drive forward, Francesca looking back with such longing -- one last glimpse of Robert's truck as it disappears into the rain; then . . . the flood of tears.<br /><br />\\"What's wrong?\\" asks her husband, as if he's never seen her cry like this - his dark eyes wary, with alarm.<br /><br />\\"I need a minute,\\" is all she can muster up, covering her face with her hands, dissolving in tears.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />In the final scenes - and the very last one in which we get to see the gentle aging face of Francesca -- she gently, lovingly removes the contents of a box that has just been delivered to her farmhouse --- from the lawyer for Kincaid's estate.<br /><br />She's inherited his early model Nikon camera, which she recognizes, and quickly sets aside, along with the silver crucifix and chain, before picking up a small red picture book with a dying sunset on its cover; it is the fruit of their few, joyful days together, and titled appropriately \\"Four Days by Robert Kincaid.\\"<br /><br />Francesca's lovely old hands open the book to the first printed page, inscribed to her \\"FOR F\\"  -- below it, an introductory snippet of poetry, \\"by Byron\\" Inserted at that page, is a many-times-folded and yellowing note - the one she hand-wrote, after feeding him ahome-cooked meal:<br /><br />\\"If you'd like supper again<br />`When white moths are on the wing'<br />Come by tonight after you're finished.<br />Anytime is fine.\\"<br /><br />Beneath the printed page's inscription, \\"FOR F,\\" is the poem by Byron. (I always mean to jot it down; this time I did!)<br /><br />\\"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods<br />There is a rapture on the lonely shore<br />There is society where none intrude<br />By the deep sea, and music is to roar . . .<br />I love not Man the less, but Nature more.<br />From these our interviews, in which I steal<br />From all I have been before<br />To mingle with the universe and feel . . .<br />What I can n'ere express<br />Yet cannot all conceal.\\"<br /><br />NOTE for those who care about such things: the achingly-beautiful `love theme' heard throughout this movie (the orchestrations are so evocative) surges up finally, as Francesca appreciates for the first time the book about their Four Days. (Bet \\"there wasn't a dry eye\\" at this movie's premiere showing!)<br /><br />That memorable theme music vividly reminds us of Clint Eastwood's strengths as a musician: He co-wrote this one, calling it \\"Doe Eyes\\" -- \\"Love Theme from The Bridges of Madison County.\\" (His co-composer was Lennie Niehaus.)<br /><br />Such subtleties didn't come up during Clint's interview with David Letterman. And, perhaps at this late juncture, most of us don't care to watch the credits to their end to learn such things.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood would be the first to admit, as an actor he is not in Meryl Streep's league  (who is?) But in their last scene together, at the supper table, the evening before her husband and son & daughter return with a blue ribbon from the `state fair,' Clint's character `delivers' in his powerless attempt to pursuade \\"Francesca\\" to run away with him.<br /><br />Their characters so needy for each other - the ache is palpable! Each time I watch that moment in this understated gem of a film -- the best `twin-soliloquy' of its kind, I say - our hearts ache for two wonderful, decent human beings who must tear themselves apart. Strangers only days earlier, now they have no real choice but to let go, turn away and 'no looking back.'

0712657592|2.0|The main issue I have with this book is that it is a fairly boring read. The second is that it is filled with vague generalities that don't fit into any recognizable scientific or psychological norms. It is essentially one man's take on what it means to be happy. As a definition of happiness, it sort of works, but there isn't really any substance to the book. Filled with oblique metaphor, anecdotal evidence, and a loosely defined spiritualism that is most similar to Zen Buddhism, the book does nothing to provide any answers on how one can truly be happy. The pursuit of 'flow,' admirable as it may be, is in no way definable as making one happy any more than any other esoteric personal philosophy. If you're interested in the nature of happiness or in invigorating your own creative spirit, there are much better resources available.<br /><br />2/5 Stars. Turbid, unscientific, and lacking any philosophical base aside from its own claims. Give Aristotle a read instead.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Magnificent production. The scenes put me in touch with thoughts and feelings I forgot I had. Nature is wonderful!!!
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I am an active duty Soldier and have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan.  If you want to see the truth and \\"experience\\" the reality we all face, watch this series.  There is none of the normal Hollywood left wing/right wing garbage anywhere in this series.  It has no agenda except to show America the raw truth.  The attention to detail in this series is unmatched.  Down to having grid coordinates written on the inside of the Humvee windshields on the Vehicle Commander's (front passenger) side.  Which is something we all do. This is a 7 part series and it took me over two weeks to finish it.  There were several times I had to just stop watching.  That's not insulting it, that just shows how real it is.  It shows the boredom, humor, horror and absolute heartbreak of combat.  It pulls no punches.  There is no shortage of regrettable civilian casualties, which sadly, is so often the case when facing an enemy with no uniform.  It goes to great lengths to show the all too common incompetence of senior leaders who see combat tours and body bags as a means to quick promotions, and will take completely uncalculated risks to achieve that next rank, always at their men's expense.  America, I can't say enough about this series.  It's something everyone should see.<br /><br />Michael A. Sampsell<br />SFC, USA<br />Cavalryman
B001GQSY64|4.0|Yes, I am a star wars fan.  However, when you watch this keep in mind that while released as a movie, this is really just 3 episodes of a TV show.  Yes, the tv show looks exactly like the movie, so the animation won't rival the latest from dream works or pixar, but they aren't doing a new show every week.      My kids love this so I've seen it quite a few times.  I am confused about what age group they are creating this for.  Sometimes, there is death, self sacrifice and other pretty heavy duty topics, and then the battle droids play up the comedy to the 3 year old level...  Just wish they would pick an age group to play to.      Sound, video and design are reference quality.  The story is a bit cheesy, but, if you are a star wars fan, you will still enjoy it.
0446402389|3.0|OK Mr. Smith you had me 2/3 of the way through this book - Stalinist Russia was raw and disturbing, the characters were victims and scared and nothing was what it seemed and trust was a word rarely used....BUT BY FAR this was the worst ending for a book since Nelson DeMille used the bombing and collapse of the World Trade Center as the big ending for Night Fall.  All the horror, all the injustice, the cult of personality, the famines, the river of blood.....all cleaned up and tied up in a pretty ribbon and presented to the reader by page 448 with perhaps the WORST last sentence I have ever read!!!!  Did the editor make the author wrap this up quickly and neatly????  I've got to believe there was a more plausible way to end this novel!

B000SXMQ24|4.0|I am a big pink floyd fan, and I saw the Wall film many times before checking out the album.  Everything sounds fine, except the glaring omission of \\"what shall we do now!!!\\"  To me, this was one of the coolest parts of the movie, and when I first listened to the album, I had to stop it when I realized this song wasn't on the release.  As far as I am concerned, this is a total rip-off.  Why would it not be on the album??? Just to make room for all of Roger Water's sappy piano-based tracks?  I wanted to hear one of the few songs on this piece that actually rocks, and will be listening to my live version of the Wall instead.  If anyone has any explanation for this omission, I'd love to hear it.

B001FB55YE|5.0|Finally, Guy Ritchie has returned to form with this fun, fast paced, stylistic, flick about London's crime world. Though the style and subject matter is familiar territory for Ritchie, this does not feel like a rehash 'Lock Stock' and 'Snatch,' which was a pleasant surprise. The actors are all solid, with Gerard Butler, Tom Wilkinson, Karel Roden, and Mark Strong all putting in stand-out performances. The score and soundtrack work very well with the overall feel of the film as well. As is typical in modern British film, much of the actual violence is off camera, but there is still a pervasive threat of it hanging in the air throughout. Well worth a watch for fans of Ritchie's earlier work or for fans of exploitation crime cinema in general.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Why is it every single movie I've really loved in the past few years has been a foreign film or directed by a non-American? United 93, Once, 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days...I could go on and on.    The latest great film not from the American/Hollywood model is Let The Right One In, a Swedish vampire film that is so self-assured, so perfect in its execution, I can easily name it the Best Film I've Seen in 2008. The screenplay was written by John Ajvide Lindqvist and it's based on his novel of the same name.    Oskar is a 12 year-old boy living a lonely life with his single mom in a nondescript apartment complex on the outskirts of Stockholm. He gets along with his mother, visits his kindly Dad on a farm and has revenge fantasies against the bullies who pick on him at school. One night, an older man and a 12 year old girl move in next door, immediately covering up all the windows in the apartment from the outside light.    The girl's name is Elie, and she is a vampire. The man is her human caretaker and he does so by murdering people and draining their blood so that Eli can survive.    Eli is also a lonely child, and she and Oskar begin a sweet friendship, and later, romance. Both actors who play Oskar and Eli are remarkable. Oskar is that odd, lonely boy we all know and Eli is otherworldly with eyes so mesmerizing you might actually drown in them.    While it's technically a horror film (and there are some truly chilling moments in it), Let The Right One In is also a beautiful love story and a meditation on that particular Swedish brand of ennui, of loneliness. This is no normal scare-fest, with BOOs! and gore and heroes fighting off the evil bloodsuckers. This is the kind of movie a Bergman or a Kieslowski would've made in their prime. Yes, it's a vampire film - but it is also High Art and a masterpiece of film making.    Director Alfredson composes each shot with such meticulous care, such originality, I was constantly blown away by his framing and editing choices.The look is as monochromatic as a Swedish winter, with bright splashed of red - blood in snow can be pretty startling! The movie is shot in mostly wide shots contrasted with extreme close-ups and a very narrow depth of field, with very few instances of anything in between. It creates a visual theme for both Oskar and Eli that directly relates to both the loneliness and intimacy of being both a Vampire and a preteen on the verge of of puberty, with all the confusion and sexual tension and excitement that that entails.    Which brings me back to my comparison to Hollywood films and the difference between how composition and framing is actually used: in most Hollywood fare, the movies look fantastic but its visuals are rarely shot for use as a thematic device, as a way to further tell the story - it's all just pretty pictures, shot with a shiny gloss that is interchangeable with a Bud Lite commercial. Most of the great foreign films use composition and lighting and framing as a way to tell the story - as an integral part of the story-telling, as important as the dialogue or plot.    What does this add to the final product? It creates art out of genre, new meaning out of the familiar. It also allows the film maker to tell his story without bludgeoning his audience over the head with artless exposition and boring dialogue.    Let The Right One In reveals its story in its images. The way the movie hints that Eli and her Carekeeper might have started out exactly as her love story with Oskar. The way a victim of Eli's who was not killed turns into a vampire herself and cannot live with what she has become. It's all in the way the film is told, in what's revealed to us - Alfredson does not introduce his characters in the standard Hollywood way; there is no \\"motivation\\" beyond survival and love. Each character seems fully formed as soon as they appear on screen going about their day as if they have a real history and aren't merely a screenwriters' figment and shortcut to advance the plot.    There are some truly scary moments in the film - when Eli scales a building like a spider or when the one victim of Eli's attack is herself attacked by many cats who sense her changing into the undead. Vampire conventions we all know by heart are all given a neat twist that both advances the vampire legend and grounds them in a firm reality that makes everything that much more frightening.    And if you've ever wanted to know what would happen to a vampire if he entered a house without first being invited in - this is your chance to see! In fact, the title of the movie is a clever pun on that Vampiric lore.    Let the Right One In is a great film. The best of the year, by far.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This series is an accurate and engrossing depiction of combat in Iraq. The Marines are presented realistically, as neither heroes nor villains, but men doing their jobs. There are stoic idealists like Sgt. Colbert and borderline psychotics like Cpt. America, and everything in between. This is just like any military unit, or any group of people for that matter. Instead of idealizing war, Generation Kill simply gives viewers a glimpse of what it is really like. And by the same token, the series does not condemn warfare, as many documentaries and films are so tempted to do lately.<br /><br />War is frustrating for the individual soldier. Not just the Iraq War, but any war. Generation Kill does an excellent job of capturing this frustration. The Sergeant Major's obsession with the grooming standard is a perfect example of how military units often lose track of what their priorities should be. But in the Sergeant Major's defense, standards are set for a reason. And if you stop enforcing some, others will usually follow. In combat, small standards and procedures often determine whether people live or die.<br /><br />On a more technical note, the acting and writing in Generation Kill were very well done. Realistically portraying a soldier or marine is probably one of the most difficult roles for an actor. There are so many subtle nuances of being a soldier or marine, that without actually being one, it is hard to understand them. Generation Kill did a great job of training the actors to look and sound believable.<br /><br />I was in Iraq for 27 months, in 2005 and in 2007/2008, and I can attest that this series is about as accurate as you can get in a film. I am in the Army, but I worked pretty extensively with Marines during both of my tours, so I have a pretty decent knowledge of how they work. In the end, whether you are Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force or any other armed service member, the Iraq experience is for the most part universal. At different times you feel a wide range of emotions, from disappointment and despair, to elation and nostalgia. And Generation Kill does a great job of bringing those feelings to the viewer in a realistic and respectful way.s, from disappointment and despair, to elation and nostalgia.

B00005ATZT|4.0|Wrongly accused of his wife's murder, Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford) hunts for the true killer, a mysterious one-armed man (Andreas Katsulas), with a U.S. marshal (Tommy Lee Jones) and his team hot on his heels.    Director Andrew Davis keeps things moving and Ford and Jones are both riveting in their roles.  A few of Dr. Kimble's escapes strain credulity, but the film never fails to entertain and the finale is very satisfying.

B0013LPS7U|5.0|This fantastic debut from 1980 finally became available in a glorious deluxe edition in 2008.  The remastering, supervised by guitarist The Edge, is bold and crystal clear. The booklet contains an excellent essay, great early photos, original artwork and the cover art from the early singles. Edge adds some interesting personal notes as well. I'd rate the original album 5 stars and the bonus CD probably 3 (in terms of the quality of the music itself), but the whole package is so excellent it easily deserves the 5 star rating. BOY is an album born of humble beginnings that dared to dream big.<br /><br />Disk 2:<br /> Here are U2's roots, the sprouting seeds hungrily twisting to life. Back in the 80's I collected U2 B-sides and I had vinyl copies of tracks 2,3,6,7,8,9,12 &13. For any true U2 fan this stuff is essential listening. From the beginning, Bono was the real deal; he wrote about what he knew and what he lived. Many of his early lyrics reflect the pains of growing up, childhood escapism and the starry-eyed excitement of youth. On disk 2, Bono can be heard struggling to find his voice and master it. By the time he recorded vocals for BOY, his voice was magnificent. This was a golden age for Bono - unravaged by the passage of time, tobacco tar, screaming and generally overextending his vocals, his voice sounds positively angelic. But that certainly wasn't always the case on these earliest recordings. (The worst his voice got in recent times was around the ALL THAT YOU CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND album and he needed an operation to save it. It sounds great on their new album NO LINE ON THE HORIZON)<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />1) \\"I Will Follow\\" (alt mix - previously unreleased) - The most noticeable thing I hear on this mix is an intermittent Edge guitar shimmer cranked up much louder than the subtle background ambiance it provides on the album version. It gives the song a distinctive feel, otherwise it's not too different but not as good as the original either. ****<br /><br />2) \\"11 O'clock Tick Tock\\" - U2's first single on Island records is a winner, featuring a quirky tick-tock rhythm and a killer coda with some compelling Edge chords. The song would continue to develop through live performances. ****<br /><br />3) \\"Touch\\" (B-side of \\"11 O'clock Tick Tock\\") - Bono spouts punk histrionics over a driving beat before soaring over the song like a eagle at the chorus. Ends with another upbeat coda. For those in the know this is a post-punk classic. ****1/2<br /><br />4) \\"Speed of Life\\" (previously unreleased) - Adam Clayton is no show boat virtuoso on bass yet he plucks along swiftly through this cool but undeveloped rocker. A seed that never spawned. ***<br /><br />5) \\"Saturday Night\\" (previously unreleased) - This song eventually evolved into \\"Fire.\\" The music itself is almost identical but the lyrics are completely alien. Not as good as \\"Fire\\" although it's possibly more organic. It's fascinating to hear this embryonic incarnation. ****<br /><br />6) \\"Things To Make and Do\\" (B-side of \\"A Day Without Me\\") - an energetic, very basic song with a classic U2 sound. No vocals, it was a chance for Bono to catch his breath during shows from the early days. ****<br /><br />tracks 7-9 consist of U2's first ever release, the U2-3 EP --<br /><br />7) \\"Out of Control\\" - Bono's voice is clearly out of control as he spastically warbles over a spirited if sloppy take. Those who haven't heard these early versions are in for a shock. ***1/2<br /><br />8) \\"Boy/Girl\\" - I distinctly recall how baffled I was to first hear this juvenile, spasmodic tune. Bono's bizarre vocal ejaculations are obviously influenced by Siouxsie Sioux and of course The Sex Pistols, indirectly. A trip to hear, many no doubt find it unbearable to listen to. **<br /><br />9) \\"Stories for Boys\\" - finds U2 still searching for their own sound. U2-3 comes a little too close to sounding like generic classic rock and the cowbell on \\"Stories for Boys\\" doesn't help. ***1/2<br /><br/>10) \\"Another Day\\" - I've never heard this one before and I've wanted to since I was a teen - it's an exuberant song, Bono singing at the top of his lungs. Its adolescent themes would've fit nicely on BOY. Not a great track but I love being able to finally hear it. ***1/2<br /><br />11) \\"Twilight\\" (B-side of \\"Another Day\\") - A more polished version of this song would go on to be a highlight on BOY, but this version is killer post-punk rock. The lyrics are different and I love the Siouxsie-ish histrionics (Yes, I'm calling you on it Bono). *****<br /><br />tracks 12&13 were recorded live at the Marquee in London, Sept. 22, 1980 --<br /><br />12) \\"Boy/Girl\\" - this weird, vaguely transsexual tune sounds absolutely great in this live setting, a stunning improvement over the studio version. It's got a more natural, assured, road-tested feel. Somehow, they took a dorky song and made it sound cool. ****1/2<br /><br />13) \\"11 O'clock Tick Tock\\" - Edge's guitar soars on this one. Bono and the Edge feed off each other to thrilling effect. *****<br /><br />14) \\"Cartoon World\\" (previously unreleased) - a very interesting relic from an historic show recorded on Feb. 26, 1980 at The National Stadium in Dublin, the night they got signed to Island. Bono sounds pissed about the persistent feedback (plaguing his audition?) while the band get their Kinks on. Very cool! ***1/2/>10) \\"Another Day\\" - I've never heard this one before and I've wanted to since I was a teen - it's an exuberant song, Bono singing at the top of his lungs.

B001TOD92C|5.0|Mickey Rourke's portrayal of a \\"broken down piece of meat\\" merits five stars because of all the emotions that it stirs up in the viewer, and that is a true testament to his talent as an actor. Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson feels like a real person, someone you care about despite knowing that he brought much of his loneliness and personal agony on himself. Randy has been involved in wrestling for so long that it's his only means of identifying himself, even though he knows that it could kill him in the end. His wrestling buddies are a sort of surrogate family to a man who has alienated his daughter and cannot get close enough to the woman, stripper Cassidy, who has captured his heart. You cringe when seeing him continue the self-destructive behaviors that threaten his health and relationships, yet you cheer him on anyway and want him to survive and be happy. You see, Randy is imminently likeable. An early scene shows him wearily encouraging a young mohawk-sporting wrestler; he is almost fatherly while talking to the young man right before they go into the ring and beat the hell out of each other.<br />Particularly brutal is a match where a staple gun and barbed wire are used. One can hardly imagine engaging in this sort of activity for the sake of a buck, yet Randy does it - for the money, and for reasons unfathomable to most. He has gotten comfortable in this lifestyle, may wish to break free of it but doesn't know how. (That's my take on it, anyway). He is a human being, and no matter the circumstances of his ruin, does not deserve to be all alone in life.<br />You need not be a wrestling fan to appreciate this film. See it for the excellent performances from Rourke and Marissa Tomei and the humanity they bring to their roles. See it if you have ever been lonely yourself and have questioned your own identity. See it for the beautiful art of filmmaking. Just see it.
B001CJJWJ8|5.0|Here is a second issue on CD of Solti's pioneering recording of Verdi's Don Carlo, the Italian five-act version, and this time with the original LP cover of the Royal Opera House (Covent Garden) interior, in a photo bubble.  I remember the LPs with much nostalgia since it was the first complete operatic recording I bought with my allowance, saved over many months, when a teenager in England back in the 1960s.  I treasure the boxed set to this day despite the fact that I still have to set up my old record-player !    When it came out on CD in Europe, about six or so years ago, I asked my brother on the Continent to purchase a copy for me.  And the price then was exorbitant.  Now this first CD version is readily available in the U.S., with the set design of the King's study (Act IV, Scene 1) for a 1912 La Scala production on the slip-case cover. The price is much reduced.  However, this latest release, part of Decca's 'The Originals', is even cheaper, at least $11.00 less. I cannot comment on its packaging, what is or is not included (e.g., synopsis, libretto, etc.).  But, even 'naked', it is a bargain, the same recording, cast and all.    This recording was seminal in reviving interest in Verdi's Don Carlo, one of his few forays into 'grand opera' in the French manner, most fashionable back in the middle to late 19th Century.  In fact, today, there are two excellent recordings of the original French version, Don Carlo with an 's' - (Abbado from 1985 on DG and Pappano from 1996 on EMI).  Verdi, in my opinion, perfected the form in Don Carlo, combining scenes of intimacy (his native instinct) with pageantry (the French public's insistence at the time).  Thank heavens Verdi omitted the obligatory ballet music, a requirement in his first French grand opera attempt in Les Vepres siciliennes.  You have a skilful combination of scenes, private and public, beautifully crafted, and moving.  His Aida would be the culmination of this effort.        Too long neglected, Solti inthis recording, with a cast of stars, did us a huge favour in bringing back Don Carlo to our attention, and he is largely responsible for its revival.  And it is a first-class performance, with Bergonzi, Tebaldi, Bumbry and Ghiaurov, in superb form in roles for which they were famous both on stage and in the recording studio.  In addition, Martti Talvela is a dark and menacing inquisitor, and Fischer-Dieskau, a sensitive and sympathetic Rodrigo.  For these two great actor-singers, this is a worthy tribute to their art.  Some, including Tebaldi at the time, were surprised at the casting of Fischer-Diskau.  Not to worry.  Few have sung Rodrigo's part so convincingly, and so musically.  And Solti's conducting, high voltage as always, works admirably to keep our attention during this sprawling epic.  (The story is mostly fictitious but this is, after all, the world of opera !)    This recording, despite its age, and the many interpretations which have followed, using various editions of the score, and there are many, remains a classic.  Nice to see it back in circulation, and affordable.
B001PPGAIA|1.0|We couldn't decide if this movie was supposed to be a comedy or serious.  It may have been one of, if not THE, worst movie of 2008!  The only reason for one star is Hugh Jackman, who even in a corny thing like this can come across as someone watchable.  And what is with Nicole Kidman and those pumped up lips - it seemd to affect her performance.  People, don't bother with this movie!

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Watched Clint Eastwood's Changeling with Angelina Jolie last night.<br /><br />Brilliant film.  Hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />It takes place in 1928 in LA, and Eastwood definitely gave it that old classic film feel with its antique cars, trolley, amazing hats, and sad sad trumpet.<br /><br />Angelina is amazing.  It had to be the hats and those lips, and those eyes.  You really felt her pain as Christine Collins, a mother whose child goes missing.  The LAPD tell her they've found her child five months later, but its the wrong boy.<br /><br />They then try to convince Christine she's crazy because the boy says he's her son.  Despite dental records and the words of teachers also saying its not her boy, Christine is committed to a mental institution.  At the mercy of the police, this movie tears your heart apart slowly and like Christine herself, you'll cry for justice.<br /><br />\\"I want my son.  I want MY son back,\\" she cries.<br /><br />It's hard to believe this really happened.  So, while watching it, don't forget that finger printing and DNA evidence weren't around back in the 20s.  I'd certainly hope something like this would never happen today, but there are indeed innocent people in prisons who are only victims of bad fate.<br /><br />Christine found herself at the mercy of a serial killer who may, or may not, have killed her son.  The killer sent a telegram to her two years after trial on the eve of his execution, but even then couldn't bring himself to actually admit to her face what he might have done.<br /><br />Christine watched him hang, but still didn't find solace until 5 years later when another missing child was found who had also been kidnapped by the killer.  Her son had helped the kid escape.  So, there was hope that maybe her boy escaped too.<br /><br />The real Christine died, still searching for her son but never finding him.  But just as she said in the film after hearing the kid's story about how her son helped him escape, \\"His story gave me something I didn't have before.  Hope.\\"<br /><br />If you have kids, or even if you don't, see this film!f you don't, see this film!

B0001WGDX0|4.0|***Note: This is an amended review from a previously very positive one.***  I have decided to update my review of this set in light of many years of listening and comparing versions of the symphonies. I have come to reconsider this set over time as one that doesn't really compete with so many other sets available. I enjoy Bernstein's recorded output very much, and find his Brahms and Mahler with the VPO to be stellar and very enjoyable. I really enjoyed this cycle the first time I heard it, having spent so many years with Karajan's 1977 set, as well as a few others, such as Abbado's newer BPO set. At the time, it was a fresh look at a different approach that garnered a great deal of enthusiasm, although I must admit at the time that enthusiasm was in part generated by the high quality of cannabis I was regularly imbibing, which makes just about everything sound better.  While the performances offer excellent playing and well-recorded sound, perhaps slightly fierce at times, though still warm and spacious overall, I cannot say that I have gone to this cycle for any of of these performances as a go-to choice for any one symphony. I do enjoy the Eroica here, but enjoy others more. It is one of the slower and more expansive approaches, however other conductors pull off more sublimity than Bernstein does here. The 5th is less successful, the first movement too slow, the second too fast and the finale is not as impressive as Kleiber's for instance.   The 6th is a fine performance and one of the highlights of the set, however I still don't find myself listening to it very often when so many others are more satisfying. The 7th is also successful, with a tremendously enjoyable finale and an overall sense of joy that others miss, yet Abbado got a better performance out of the same orchestra only a few years later in better recorded sound.   The 9th is easily the highlight of the set, and though the first movement is very slow, it has plenty of power and drama, allowing the listener to enjoy every nuance of the score. The finale is typical Bernstein, a bit too slow, climaxes drawn out for everything they are worth, yet still there is a tremendous sense of majesty and excitement that is undeniable. The soloists are excellent, though Kollo can sound a bit strained and Jones definitely has her infamous &#34;wobble.&#34; Still, I find her contribution to be a highlight nonetheless in its purity of tone and attack. Moll is probably the best bass soloist in a performance of this symphony I've ever heard, so deep and operatic, it is an absolute joy. Bernstein really slows things down at the end to allow the soloists to relish every note of their quartet before the final eruption begins, and it is still one of my favorite moments in all Beethoven recordings. A point of detraction for me, however, is the thinly caught bass drum, which doesn't come through very well. Perhaps this is because, unlike the other symphonies being recorded in the Musikverein, I believe this performance was recorded in the Vienna Opera House, although I could be mistaken.  All told, if one did not compare this set to any others, it would be a fine set to enjoy and listen to on occasion as an examination of Bernstein's later approach and there are many merits to the cycle as a whole. As I said, however, but for the 9th I simply never find myself listening to any of these performances when there are others I enjoy far more, and thus have taken off a star and edited my review. The recording and playing quality, and what the set gets right, justify 4 stars, but not 5.

B00005OBSD|5.0|I am still amazed that when \\"Tons of Sobs\\" was recorded in 1968, all four members were still in their teens.  Yet they still manage to create an original sound with mostly original material.  With only two covers, one of which being the blistering 8+ minute \\"Goin' Down Slow,\\" Paul Rodgers shows off some impressive song writing skills as well as great rock vocals.  Paul Kossoff was a true legend on guitar, sporting the nastiest vibrato around.  With music driven by sexually suggestive lyrics and heavy guitar riffage, Free helped pave the way for hard rock.  But they also let their blues influences show here too.  Eventually the band would drift apart, but this debut sees the young members just jamming together and playing with feeling.  The additional material is mostly alternative takes, but includes a good blues jam and a couple tracks that didn't make the original album.  Definitely recommended for fans of the British blues and rock movement during the late '60s and fans of great guitar playing in general.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|I, like many others, just do not understand this copied soundd Portishead is talking about. People tried sure, but imitation is flattery, and every attempt I ever heard fell well short of the mark.    Portishead had something few bands ever get to have which is multiple albums filled with great music appreciated by a vast number of devoted followers. There is simply nothing like the Portishead of the 90's. No where near everyday every other vanilla music it touched me sometimes with barely any words at all. It was like getting in bed and the mattress is already perfectly suited to how you want to feel, perfect.    Some people felt the second album was too gritty, amongst other words. I don't think so. Both of those albums do exactly what any musician wants and that is to move it's crowd in several different ways.     I must say that knowing they were distancing themselves on purpose, they achieved exactly what they wanted, much to my chagrin. It's too often something great is forgotten, lost, or only made in limited numbers and I feel that sound is one of them. That sound, that feel, that atmosphere. I'm glad I got the two albums I did, they are genius and they are literally a big part of my life, and that's better than nothing.    Still. A sad day.

The first two, S.160& S.161 were written when Liszt and his married mistress, Countess Marie d'Agoult, left France to avoid the scandal of her being pregnant with their first of three children. The last set of piece, S.162, was written much later near the end of Liszt's life.<br /><br />In S.160 Liszt painted landscapes on the piano. In S.161 Liszt commented on art, poetry and literature.  In S.162  Liszt seems to be reconciling his life, beginning here with \\"Angelus! Priere aux anges gardiens\\" ending with \\"Sursum corda\\"<br /><br />Liszt pushed the envelop as to what was technically possible for a mere pianist, and what music could be brought forth from a mere 88 keys. Lazar Berman is up to the musical and technical challange of Liszt.<br /><br />Like most listeners, I cannot help but be awed by the \\"Valee d'Obermann\\", and \\"Orage\\". Throughout the Ann&eacute;es, Liszt (like Beethoven) used the piano like it was an orchestra.<br /><br />I was not ready for Liszt when I was younger.  The complexity of the music was lost on me.  Now I hear Debussy, Wagner, and perhaps even Schoenberg in his music.<br /><br />This is brilliant piano music, brilliantly played.  I would highly recommend this recording to anyone adding Liszt, or more Liszt, to a collection.
B000002UBV|4.0|American Pie is thirty-six minutes and twenty-four seconds long and was released in October of 1971. American Pie reached #1 on the U.S. Billboard 200 Album charts for six weeks. The cassette version does not come with Sister Fatima. Two of the songs charted from the album. The music on American Pie is mainly folk rock style; more folk and less rock. Still the music is great on the cassette version and a little upset that one of the songs is missing. So I am giving American Pie a B+.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have a Phil & Ted's Sport which is just about the best stroller I can imagine (and has a great big cargo bin under the seats) but it's a little scant on handy storage. Their hangbag was expensive and not well-rated, so I decided to try this instead. I am very pleased with it. The velcro straps make it very adjustable, with a snug fit even on my slanted handlebar. It barely swings at all and it does keep drinks upright. It has just enough room for my wallet, cell phone, and keys between the two cupholders. I like the zippered mesh pocket inside too, because my 18-month-old daughter hasn't figured out how to open it and I can leave a chapstick and pack of mints in there. Not crazy about the big logo on the front, but at least it's embroidered rather than screen-printed. Recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted something quick, yet a good workout. I love this DVD! I like it because there are three levels and you can work your way up.

Now, I am ready for the next level and am going to try her newest DVDs.

B000OQF6N6|4.0|The return of the Smashing Pumpkins was met with criticism from most corners, and their comeback album was downright torn to shreds. But, after letting the dust settle, the bias can be seen through and the truth can come out: it's really not that bad.    Sure, it can't touch Siamese Dream (1993) or Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness (1995), but this disc has enough of its own merit to stand next to the rest of the Pumpkins' discography, even with Iha and Wretzkey out of the picture.    Musically, it's the standard Pumpkins fare, blending metal and classic rock together in a furious combination, and vocally, Corgan can still hit all the notes he needs to. Unlike fellow alt. rocker Eddie Vedder, his voice still has the power it had a decade earlier.    But, despite Corgan's form, there's a problem - there's too much of him. Most of the songs have layer after layer of vocals on piled on top of each other, the result of Roy Thomas Baker's production. And Corgan's voice has always been an acquired taste - even the most adamant of fans will find that it becomes quite jarring, and quickly.    There's also another inherent problem that plagues Zeitgeist - there's moments that sound completely forced and veer straight into a brick wall. Corgan's cries for revolution in `United States' sound juvenile, and his lyrics in `That's the Way' are saccharine somewhat overbearing.    That doesn't mean that Zeitgeist is unlistenable - it's far from it. There's plenty hard rocking and sincere moments, and they make it a fun and interesting album. There's nowhere near as much fat as there is on Mellon Collie, and it doesn't drift out of focus like MACHINA (2000). It's much easier to `get' as a result, and you don't need to be feeling any particular way to give it a spin.    As a whole, Zeitgeist gives the Pumpkins another shot at the 21st century - revitalizing a damn good band that had lay dead far too long. It's straightforward; it rocks hard, and it also shows that with a good songwriter at the helm, a band can live on without all of its original members.

B0014Z4OL6|5.0|Based on the true story of James Gregory's life as a prison guard in the South African prison system. Because he speaks the language of Mandela, he is assigned to Robben Island where Mandela has been a political prisoner for 10 years already in 1968. Gregory's assignment is to monitor Mandela's mail and visitors and report any important information to his superiors. Initially, a racist in his views like other South Africans, Gregory slowly begins to see the human side of Mandela, especially when Mandela's son is killed in a car accident (murder), which may have been set up because of information Gregory provided his superiors. It's a fascinating story and a very well done movie. The acting and the script are top notch. It reminds me of the words of U.S. Olympic Champion Jesse Owens: \\"Let's go for a walk. If we walk long enough and talk long enough, we may begin to understand each other.\\" That's what Gregory and Mandela did for almost 20 years. Forgiveness and reconciliation are possible. This story proves it. As relevant today as it was twenty years ago. Enjoy.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have six of the seven of Enya's albums and she does not disappoint.  Enya is Enya and when your good...your good.  She has her \\"sound\\" and I am one of those who could listen to her all day.  My wife and I have almost worn the grooves off of the CD's so had to purchase IPOD's to save them!  \\"And Winter Came\\" is another winner.
B000RJO578|4.0|Well, there is no actual romance in this movie - but there's almost everything else. There is good spoofing humor, an endearing buddy/sidekick relationship, some examples of astute crime detection, some grisly murders, a number of slam-bam car chases, and an over-the-top shoot-out.    The shoot-out perhaps lasts a little too long, but it is inventively choreographed, so it will probably appeal even to those who generally prefer subdued, drawing room dramas. At the center of all this merry mayhem is a straight-arrow model of a modern police officer - played with super-hero stalwartness by Simon Pegg. He's a throwback to the old cowboy heroes in the movie/TV serials of the 1950's. And what a relief! He has no baggage, no \\"humanizing\\" flaws. He is not a recovering alcoholic; although he is divorced, he is not shown agonizing over parental failures; he's not a womanizer or a sadist.     It's not that this is a dully PG film. Some pretty rough language swirls through the action, and there is a fair amount of blood spatter. In spite of this though, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" ends up being a feel-good, rejoice of a film.    It also surprises audiences with cameo or supporting performances by some established British actors who haven't been seen much in films lately and about whom you just might have been wondering, \\"Where are they now?\\" For example, there's Billie Whitelaw. She's tackled some gritty roles in British films, starting in the 1950's. But I most remember her from hilarious romps such as \\"Make Mine Mink\\" with Terry-Thomas. She does a wonderful turn here - simply working a crossword puzzle. Then look for Edward Woodward of \\"Breaker Morant,\\" \\"Wicker Man,\\" and TV's \\"The Equalizer\\" fame.     There's no Director's Commentary on this disc, but there is a \\"trivia\\" subtitle option. By clicking on this accompaniment, you can learn how a lot of the characters' names and place names are homages to characters and settings in other, often obscure, but hip films. One not-so-obscure film thatis often echoed in this way is \\"Straw Dogs.\\" A lot of these details really are trivial, but if you enjoy the kind of spoofing inherent in subtle cross-referencing and self-referencing - knowing that the film is rife with these will add to your enjoyment and will keep you on your toes trying to detect them. It will turn you into a name spotter.

B0011KQSZ4|4.0|There's nothing quite as hilarious as a group of innocent people trying to dispose of a dead body. This movie makes a madcap romp of the unbidden task facing certain family members gathered for a legitimate burial, then confronted with an extra corpse.    We get to know these people as memorable characters along the way, which is half the fun. Each player comes onto the scene markedly self-absorbed. In other words, they're a typical family. All the different types are here, including the curmudgeonly uncle, the somewhat overbearing parent, and the doted-upon celebrity son. Some are called upon to come out of themselves a little though, in order to make common cause with each other and to put a lid on their mutual problem.    There are two full-length commentaries on this disc - one by the Director, and one by a couple of the actors and the writer. Both are good-natured, but don't provide too many additional insights into the filming or the film. So unless you have a fair amount of extra time, you can skip these, and just enjoy the Funeral for what it is - a jolly \\"parlor\\" game.    Then for more fun centered around trying to dispose of someone, you can check out the classic Terry-Thomas/Peter Sellers romp \\"Naked Truth.\\"

B001HN6972|3.0|Great and very touchy. Some inconsistency in the story though;<br />The lady did not know how to read; being so much in love , the young lover knew very well she did not know how to read, yet did not do anything that could help her in the court which ended up in a life sentence; Very inconsistent.<br />The first time he sees her, 20 years later, when she is about to get out of jail; his most concern is that if she had the time to think of what she did in the past; very inconsistent too. Really<br />Again the Jewish propaganda has a hand all over this movie;<br />All said, Winslet's acting is amazing. The Titanic and the reader are her best.<br />Negative feedbacks I will receive I know; but this is my honest true opinion about this movie; I think it could have been done in much broader way without the Jewish stamp everywhere; still, very good movie.

B001PPLIFU|1.0|If there was any way I could give this film negative stars, I would do it. Casino Royale was one of the best -- if not THE best -- bond movies ever made. Despite some people's criticism of Daniel Craig, personally, I feel that he is the best bond ever to step into the role...perhaps even better than Connery. Now believe me, coming from a major Connery fan, that is high praise.<br /><br />And then, there's this movie. I'm not sure if I could even call it a movie. You see, movies typically have a few components. They have scenes and dialog, which come together to form story and plot. Movies use actors, sets and props to achieve this goal. From what we could tell, this movie did not have scenes, did not have dialog, did not have sets, and perhaps had some props and actors, although one was rarely privileged enough to see an actor on screen long enough to see if he was talking, winking, or throwing us the bird. In fact, in one extremely cowardly \\"not-scene\\", bond walks into an elevator escorted by four agents. The elevator door closes, and then momentarily re-opens with the four agents unconscious on the ground, as Bond walks calmly out. Now I don't care if you are a die-hard Bond fan or just a movie fan in general, that is ridiculous. Since when did Bond become an episode of Loony Toons?<br /><br />The reason there are no scenes in this movie is that a scene must involve at least five seconds of contiguous content which is comprehensible to the audience. I do not believe there was a single, contiguous five seconds of film in this entire travesty of a movie. My wife and daughter and I were in the theater during the first scene, which may have been a car chase, and we were looking back and forth at each other with confused expressions. We think the chase ended with someone flying off a cliff (or the top of a building? hard to say). We think there were three cars, except none of us could explain where the third one came from or went to. Shortly thereafter there was a boat chase. Our dialog in our seats during the boat chase sounded something like this.<br /><br />me: \\"Is that a boat chasing them?\\"<br />wife: \\"I can't tell. I think so.\\"<br />daughter: \\"No, wait, I think it's two boats.\\"<br />me: \\"Two boats? Are you sure.\\"<br />wife: \\"...\\"<br />daughter: \\"...\\"<br />me: \\"...Wait a second, there have to be three boats!\\"<br />daughter: \\"why?\\"<br />me: \\"Because I think one just exploded, and I still keep seeing at least two distinct boat hulls.\\"<br />wife: \\"I thought that was the car on the dock that just exploded.\\"<br />me & daughter: \\"There was a dock???\\"<br /><br />That pretty much describes the entire movie, beginning to end. Now, I'm an astute moviegoer. I am the one who figures out who the bad guy is in the movie before anybody else does. I'm the one who figures out what's going on, and I was so totally and completely lost in this one that I still don't have even the smallest clue who the bad guy was, who the good guy was, what happened, and what bond was looking for in that burning building at the end. I can't possibly spoil the plot for anyone who reads this review, because there wasn't one. In fact, the only reason I made my wife and teenage daughter sit through the rest of this movie is that I wanted to try to come up with more ammo to use against it when I reviewed it. Unfortunately, there was so little substance to this movie that it didn't even give me anything else to criticize. There just wasn't anything there.<br /><br />Casino Royale was an incredible movie, and probably my all-time favorite Bond movie. Why they got the guys from \\"The Bourne Steady-Cam-Ectomy\\" to come work on a Bond movie is beyond me. Weren't Bourne 2 and 3 bad enough to teach them a lesson? Why did they pay a great actor like Daniel Craig to reprise his role, but then hide his face and prevent him from acting for the entire movie? Why would they create a Bond film that was so bad that I would rather watch two straight hours of the Jar Jar Binks scenes from Star Wars Episode I?<br /><br />This is quite possibly the worst movie ever made: not as a Bond movie, but just as a movie in general. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE.<br /><br />[EDIT]<br />Since I have received some comments about talking in the theater, I would like to point out that my wife, my daughter and myself were the only ones in the theater at the time. We saw it near the end of its run, and nobody in our small town was foolish enough to come back and see it a second time. Apparently our town has an average IQ over 70.<br /><br />That said, I hope those who comment on my review will focus on its content rather than the fact that we were talking in an otherwise empty theater.t as a Bond movie, but just as a movie in general. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE.    [EDIT]  Since I have received some comments about talking in the theater, I would like to point out that my wife, my daughter and myself were the only ones in the theater at the time.

B0019OP0GU|4.0|Having never read Noel Streatfield's \\"Ballet Shoes\\", I can't compare this movie adaptation to the book [I understand that the movie is a condensed version of the book], but I must say I found the movie to be quite entertaining. This is partly due to the wonderful assembly of actors chosen to act in it and the various familiar faces - Emilia Fox [ played the role of Ms Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice], Emma Watson [Hermione of Harry Potter fame], Lucy Boynton [played the youngest Ms Dashwood in the 2008 adaptation of Sense and Sensibility], Richard Griffiths [also of Harry Potter], Harriet Walter, Eileen Atkins, and Gemma Jones. It was so wonderful seeing all these beloved actors together in one movie.<br /><br />The story starts with an eccentric paleontologist, Dr GUM [Great Uncle Matthew played by Richard Griffiths] who is forced to take in his orphaned niece Sylvia [later played by Emilia Fox] who is accompanied by her nurse, Nana. Over the next several years, GUM goes off on expeditions returning each time with a baby girl, and the three are raised as sisters - Pauline Fossil [Emma Watson], Petrova Fossil [Yasmin Paige], and Posy Fossil [Lucy Boynton]. When GUM goes off on another expedition and doesn't return for 12 years, the ladies and girls are left to fend for themselves, forced to take in boarders, and Pauline also goes to work on the stage as an actress to supplement the family income. The focus is mostly on the three girls, and though Emma Watson does a credible job with her role, she is often outshined by Yasmin Paige as the middle sister, Petrova, who finds herself in a quandary - she can neither act well like Pauline or dance like Posy. What she wishes for ardently is to be an aviator, a high ambition indeed for one so young and at a time when women pilots were few and far between.<br /><br />There is also a sub-plot [which seems more like an afterthought] focusing on a supposed love triangle between Sylvia, a male lodger, Mr Simpson [Marc Warren], and female boarder Theo Dane [Lucy Cohu].<br /><br />The story was paced well-enough but was flawed in terms of character development if only because of the movie's length - only 84 minutes total running time. But the period details were wonderful and the charming and able cast made it a worthwhile and engaging watch.<br /><br />Some of the bonuses on the DVD include an interview with Emma Watson, some deleted scenes, a movie trailer, and a audiobook reading of an excerpt from Ballet Shoes.Warren], and female boarder Theo Dane [Lucy Cohu].

B001P5Q6FC|5.0|That is the question..where WRATH is going to hit you first? Personally it hit me in the head first and.... still dizzy.    Wrath is first of all, a complete album. It´s not a collection of \\"hits\\" like they tried to do with Sacrament (don´t get me wrong, Sacrament did my day and it´s still a good album).     The thing is LOG sounds in Wrath the way they suppose to do. It´s relentless, powerful, menacing and sometimes even hard to listen.    Good fun and aggression, let´s hope they keep it up!!!!    A solid album delivered by one of the extremely few innovators out there.    Cheers.

B001R10BMS|4.0|The result of Kevin McClory's lawsuit against Ian Fleming (and much later Cubby Broccoli) over THUNDERBALL, it has Sean Connery returning to harness as Commander James Bond 12 years after departing the series. A film that had a torturous history. Originally announced in 1976 as JAMES BOND OF THE SECRET SERVICE (McClory's agreement with Cubby Broccoli & Harry Saltzman called for him to be able to remake the story 10 years after THUNDERBALL's release -- some have speculated that the two Bond producers didn't believe the character would survive that long. Connery once described Broccoli & Saltzman as \\"Two guys sitting across a desk, looking at each other and each one thinking, 'That bugger's got half what should all be mine.'\\"), he was promptly sued by Broccoli & company. Later Sean Connery would come on board with British Spy novelist Len Deighton (THE IPCRESS FILE, FUNERAL IN BERLIN, et al) to write a new screen treatment now called WARHEAD. Connery even went on a scouting trip to NYC to check out locations (including the Statue of Liberty). As legal entanglements dragged on, McClory eventually sold the rights to Hollywood lawyer (and Talia Shire's husband) Jack Schwartzman. The film managed to lure Connery back for a reported $3 or $4 million. Basically using the THUNDERBALL scenario (legally, it couldn't stray too far from the original story) NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN is a curious film. While it works when Connery is on screen (and he is alot), somehow it isn't totally satisfying. It lacks the sense of urgency and worldwide menace that the original had. The Legrand score stinks (the fault of Sean Connery who insisted on him), the finale lacks the drama epic scope of the original underwater battle, Kim Bassinger is lovely but lack Claudine Auger's charm; Klaus Maria Brandeur -- a fine actor -- is interesting as Largo but everything seems less than the original. Of standout mention: Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush -- sexy and murderously deranged. However her character departs half-way through the film. Edward Fox as M doesn't make it, Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter is fine but Pamela Salem is a weak Moneypenny. Rowan Atkinson, a fine comedian, is completely absurd as British Embawsy nebbish Nigel Small-Fawcett. Some nice touches: Aftering water sking into Bond's arms at a Bahaman bar...<br />Fatima Blush: I've made you all wet!<br />Bond: Yes, but my martini is still dry.<br />Released the same year as the Eon series 13th outing, OCTOPUSSY, the Moore film made more money. Also of note, the same year George Lazenby played a character only referred to as \\"JB\\" in THE RETURN OF THE MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E.

B001CTDH58|5.0|Walt Disney has had success with their canine films, especially since their 1997 film \\"Air Bud\\" and recently with their \\"Buddies\\" (talking puppies) films that utilize special effects showcasing the mouth movements with the voice work.<br /><br />As many of those films were direct-to-video, Walt Disney Pictures took things up a notch by having \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" as a feature film and taking things to a new level in this enjoyable, family/adventure film starring a talented cast which includes Drew Barrymore, Jamie Lee Curtis, George Lopez, Piper Perabo, Andy Garcia, Manolo Cardona, Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez, Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos and many other talents.<br /><br />And on one end of the spectrum, you have these well-known talented human actors but \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" probably features the most canine talent anyone probably will see in a film.<br /><br />And sure enough, the film resonated well with audiences in Fall 2008 taking the #1 spot in the box office and grossing over $29 million in its first weekend beating out major heavy hitters.  But can a film about chihuahuas really be that entertaining?  Definitely.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />I have to give credit to Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment because their Blu-ray disc releases have been phenomenal in terms of picture and audio quality.  The same can be said for \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" which features the dogs outdoors quite a bit in Los Angeles and Mexico. Video is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1.<br /><br />From the blue skies, amber sun, and various locations of where the film was shot, the picture quality was great!<br /><br />The audio quality is also very good.  At English 5.1 uncompressed (48 kHz/24-Bit) audio, the film relies mostly on dialogue and music which comes out radiantly clear on your front channel speakers but there are times where you hear the special effects utilized in the rear channels as well.  You can hear the vocals clearly, so overall, the audio quality was very good!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" contains a good number of special features that are exclusive to Blu-ray.<br /><br />  * Pet Pals: The Voices Behind the Dogs -  A very good special feature with interviews with Drew Barrymore, George Lopez, Andy Garcia, Cheech Marin, Paul Rodriguez, Placido Domingo, Edward James Olmos and more.  The talent talk about their role and talking about the dogs that they own.  Afterwards is a segment featuring Drew Barrymore and the charity organization that she works with about rescued dogs.<br />  * Hitting Their Bark:  On Set with the Dogs of BHC - This featurette goes into the making of the film and you can literally see how many dogs were used on the film and how certain scenes were accomplished.  I was amazed of how bright the dog that plays Chloe was.  Hitting her mark and a great job for a canine in the film.  The same can be said with the others.  Of course, there were challenges such as placing Chloe on top of Delgado's head/back.  You could tell the dog that plays Delgado wanted none of that.  But overall, a very impressive featurette because I can imagine how challenging it was to make everything come together for this film.<br />  * More Deleted Scenes with Introductions by Director Raja Gosnell - 45 minutes of deleted scenes and each scene was introduced by the director.  What's amazing is that the scenes cut were actually quite major but I can tell for pacing and time reasons, they needed to really stay at 91 minutes, I don't think fidgety children would watch two hours or more.  So, great idea to trim it down but the type of footage featured, I can imagine how difficult things it was to cut because one cut went into explaining more about Rachel's character and how she's been unsuccessful in finding a job.  But the scenes that were largely cut were the scenes that focused on the chihuahuas and their ancestry and the original script was more on that and more spiritual in that these chihuahuas will be watched over by the ghost of their ancestors.

Right up there with the best of them: Shout at the Devil, Invasion of Your Privacy, Pyromania, and arguably even Appetite For Destruction. A lot of hair metal is a big joke now, but this one is a gem even in 2009.

Hurry, Markus!  I have read all of your books and hunger for more.  I am not one to care about celebrity or fan clubs and such, but it would be such a pleasure to meet and talk with you as you must be a fine man to have touched my heart so deeply.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Well...    The Sixaxis/Dual Shock 3 is a pretty large step backwards.  The original triggers sucked... and compared to the 360 controller... it's just not as ergonomic, comfortable or usable.    In come Real Triggers...    These make a HUGE difference.  Able to hold onto the controller more comfortably and it makes the triggers feel TONS better.    Now if only someone would make aftermarket analog sticks that were concave and not convex.  DUMBEST DECISION EVER.  My thumb constantly slips off the analog stick (or I have to constantly reposition my thumbs) while playing NHL 09.      I have already tried to take the analog sticks out of an old Wired 360 controller.  Sadly... they are different heights and the 360 sticks didn't allow full range of motion in the PS3 controller shell.

1416562605|4.0|The greatest strength of The White Tiger is the sardonic wit of its narrator, Balram Halwai.  Balram is the novel's morally ambiguous protagonist whose desire to break free of the chicken coop (metaphorically speaking) drives him to commit murder and sacrifice his family, but these are the choices he must make to live the life he longs for; that is, the life of a man with a full belly.<br /><br />The White Tiger explores the division of social classes, or castes, in India (and arguably, the world).  Balram sees the world consisting of those who are eaten, and those who do the eating. He longs to move from the first group to the latter.  Balram sees himself as a white tiger, a rare breed of predator; but he soon discovers that even white tigers must live in cages of their own.<br /><br />Metaphors aside, The White Tiger is an entertaining story about a man from the darkness (the most backward region of India) who becomes a successful entrepreneur.  Balram is an intelligent man who learns that an ability to eavesdrop, ruthlessness and corruption are all important traits for a man who wishes to change his caste.  An interesting feature of this novel is that while Balram's actions are ultimately deplorable, he remains an engaging (and even likeable) character.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable debut novel featuring one of the most memorable characters in contemporary fiction.  Well worth reading.

B001BTG3OQ|1.0|For a $469 flash, you'd think Nikon would put out something that, at least works. Second time i used it - with my D3 shooting an outdoor event for minimal fill-in flash, the SB900 shut down on me, giving me an overheat message. It took ten minutes to cool. I was shooting at ISO 1000 for fill-in, for crying out loud! I was using a diffuser (Stofen) and had taken around 30 shots--not even continually -- but over a ten-minute period. This one's going back. Unfortunately, for pro D3 shooters, we are VERY limited by Nikon for flashes - it's either the sb900 (junk) the sb600 (have one - it doesn't do the job and will not even connect to a Quantum) and the substandard 400.
B000060OFT|4.0|I was a gawky twelve-year old when this movie was released in 1996. I was negotiating for the first time the treacherous battlefield of middle school hallways: the gossip, the insecurity, and the foreign sensations, the blushing flush of first infatuations. It was a perfect time for me to see this movie. I remember the breathless trailers. Rat-a-tat shots of gang gunplay, adolescent romance, bright colors, and explosions, all backed by a pounding, bass-heavy soundtrack. Suddenly the old Bard of Avon seemed cool.<br /><br />The theater was packed when I went. I recognized some kids from my school. The median age was probably 16. The lights dimmed. The screen flickered. The movie started. And off we went. Here was a world we recognized, a garish world of guns, trendy fashions, and solipsistic teenagers scribbling poetry in their notebooks. The audience snickered with recognition at Romeo's poolside pleading to Juliet, \\"Wilst thou leave me so unsatisfied?\\" And Juliet's retort, \\"What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?\\" Gunplay and drug use and raging hormones. Well meaning adults and over-possessive parents. It was so familiar, but heightened, transfused into grand opera.<br /><br />I'm no longer the wide-eyed innocent thrilling to Radiohead b-sides and drooling over Claire Danes (okay, not quite true). So how does the movie hold up? I'll be honest: I can't quite dissociate myself from the movie's nostalgic associations. But I'll try and be objective.<br /><br />What holds up surprisingly well are the performances. The supporting cast is filled out nicely with well-cast veterans and some fresh-faced newcomers. I love John Leguizamo's cocksure Tybalt, all pointy teeth and resin-lined voice. Harold Perrineau (now I can't help but see Michael from LOST!) is a surprisingly affecting as the cross-dressing, drug-dealing misfit, Mercutio. He feeds Romeo a suspicious looking pill (ecstasy? acid?) before the Capulet party, and the results are appropriately trippy.<br /><br />Pete Posthlewaite as Friar Laurence possesses the kind of natural ease with the dialogue that suggests many years of hard-won training on the boards. He wraps his lips around Shakespeare's Gordian knotted language as easily as if he were reading a grocery list--and with a put-on American accent!<br /><br />Since this film DiCaprio has proven himself a worldwide mega-star, headlining such moneymaking behemoths as Titanic and The Departed. Here he captures the passion, the poetry, and the primal rage that imprison Romeo at any given moment. He's a slave to his emotions. He spends his time scrawling poetry in little black books and looking fashionably disaffected. He drops Rosalind in an instant after a one-time encounter with Juliet. He kills Juliet's kin, Tybalt, to revenge his friend's death, his face twisted into a terrible mask of rage. Later, after exile, he dies by his own hand thinking Juliet dead.<br /><br />Ah, Juliet. Claire Danes. Okay, here's where the objectivity becomes difficult. She seemed like the epitome of mysterious older girl sensuality to me when I first saw this movie and now I'm writing from the perspective of someone a few years her senior when she made this movie. Hindsight shows that she doesn't have quite the same grasp and fluidity with the words DiCaprio possesses. What she does have is a winning smile and angelic features and an almost painful sincerity that broke so many hearts on the popular MTV program, \\"My So-Called Life.\\"<br /><br />I believe the Bard himself would like this movie. It has the spirit of the play--the tempestuous first love, the overbearing parents, the head-on collision with fate. It's aggressive and passionate and full of tumbling forward-moving energy. \\"Vitality\\" is the word Harold Bloom uses to summarize Shakespeare's enduring popularity and I think the adjective applies here. Luhrmann understands that the generation-spanning attraction to Shakespeare isn't always his words, strictly speaking, but rather the intensity and the passion that the words emote. We all know what it's like to be young and in love. Shakespeare gives words to those feelings. And they happen to be better written words than any others in the history of the English language. So what's lost here is the purity of the poetry, but what's gained is a new generations of kids saying, \\"Maybe Shakespeare isn't so bad, after all.\\" They'll discover the poetry in time.ll know what it's like to be young and in love.

Just when you think you've heard every, tired, version of your favorite songs...to the point you just get bored of listening to Christmas music, along comes James Taylor and breathes new life into them!  Listening to this album takes your imagination to a place where the snow is falling gently, there is a roaring fire in the fireplace, and good friends and family are close.  Some sacred, some fun, all soothing and sentimental, as only James Taylor can do.

B001CTDH4Y|4.0|The trailer for this film was a spectacular Busby Berkeley-style musical number that looked mighty fun, but has little to do with the final film. Personally, I thought this film was going to be a turkey, but it turned out to be a very well-done and fun family film.<br /><br />Here's the story: Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis) is a wealthy Beverly Hills businesswoman who practically worships Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), her chihuahua, dressing it in designer outfits and giving it an over-the-top real diamond collar. When Chloe has to go out of town, her flakey niece Rachel (Piper Perabo) is left in charge. Rachel goes south of the border to Mexico to party with her friends and Chloe gets dog-napped while there. Chloe is rescued from the Mexico City dog fights by a German Shephard, Delgado (voiced by Andy Garcia), who becomes her \\"bodyguard.\\" The dognappers learn of Chloe's/Vivian's wealth and they want her back at all costs. Rachel also desperately wants Chloe back and teams up with Viv's landscaper handsome Sam (Manolo Cardona). Predictably, the journey is about Chloe losing her Beverly Hills snobbery (and Chanel No. 5 scent) and Rachel maturing; this helps pave the way for Chloe and Rachel to find true love with mates they would have previously not thought worthy. Sam's chihuahua Pap&iacute; (voice of George Lopez) pursues Chloe during the entire movie and helps Sam & Rachel find her. Naturally, the motivation of the movie is to find and return Chloe before Viv returns from her trip.<br /><br />Is the plot predictable? Sure...but boy is it fun to watch. Barrymore, Garcia, and Lopez have great chemistry, and the special effects/stunt work for the dogs is amazing. You actually believe they are talking after awhile, it's that good. There are a few semi-scary scenes that the younger ones might be a little freaked by, but nothing having an adult nearby wouldn't take care of. Although a dialogue-driven film, the lively music and some of the sound effects will give your speakers a more than ample workout.<br /><br />DVD & Blu-ray Extras:<br /><br />* Legend of the Chihuahua: An all-new animated short that is very fun; very reminiscent of the Disney classic cartoon \\"Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom\\" in its style and storytelling.<br /><br />* Blooper Scooper: Blooper reel that shows a little of the difficulty in getting the dogs to do what they were supposed to do.<br /><br />* 3 Deleted scenes with intros by Director Raja Gosnell: These are fun, but not essential to the plot and were wisely removed. They are shown at various stages of development, as the animation (for the dogs to speak) is missing in many of these. Scenes are:<br />1. Chihuahua Nation<br />2. Chloe's Vision Quest (would have really dragged the plot down)<br />3. Mi Coraz&oacute;n: Chloe and Papi's Duet<br /><br />* Audio commentary (widescreen version only) by Director Raja Gosnell. Interestingly enough, Gosnell had the voice talent dub together, so that ad-libbing could be used and that they could play off each other. It works, as the chemistry in this film between the dogs really is apparent.<br /><br />Blu-ray Exclusive Extras:<br /><br />* Pet Pals: The Voices Behind the Dogs<br />* Hitting the Bark: On set with the dogs of \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\"<br />* Additional deleted scenes<br />* BD-Live (US Only)<br /><br />Specs:<br />Audio-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, French & Spanish Language Tracks (Dolby Digital 2.0), French & Spanish Subtitles * Video: Widescreen (2.40:1) or Full Screen (1.33:1)workout.

1439102813|5.0|This is a book I saw on Amazon and saw it got a good review so thought it would be worth reading.  It sure is.  This is just a fantastic book!  It is a story about Alice Howland who gets early Alzheimer's disease.  It's funny, sad, powerful and tells how she and her family handled having it.  This, I think, is the definitive book on Alzheimer's.  Hard to put down.  I'm not surprised if people could read it in one sitting.  It's that good.  Do not miss reading this.  It will stay with you for a long time!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I don't know what the reviewer \\"Gordon Larko\\" is smoking. For some eason, he feels compelled to leave the EXACT SAME horrible review and 1 STAR rating for all GAY-THEMED movies. Probably a \\"personal problem\\" of his. Hopefully this review will help correct this imbalance. I can't believe AMAZON is allowing this GAY BASHER to use their website as a venue to spread his hate.  By the way, This is an absolutely WONDERFUL movie!
B001DJ7PR8|1.0|Two American girls go to Barcelona, both behave in different, but equally silly, ways while attempting to \\"find themselves\\". Neither do manage to learn very much at all, least of all the one supposedly doing post-graduate research on Catalan culture, - she seems to do no study either, which might help. They fall victim to a smouldering hulk, and his over the top ex-Wife. (This role well played by Ms Cruz).    If this plot reminds you somewhat of Henry James, you might choose one of his novels rather than this very lame, unfunny and sad little film. Alternatively, go to the back catalogue of Mr Allen if you seek amusement.
B0001I55NS|5.0|A very good movie. An artful blend of science fiction and history, with a touch of romance. Good action, a good portryal of the trebuchet as the \\"terror weapon\\" of the 1300's  Worth watching.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is a very good transfer of the source film and looks great on Blu-Ray. This was a low budget movie so the source never had a particularly cinematic quality but it's way ahead of the DVD version.  The extras are fine including, to my surprise, some rather good deleted scenes and an effective 'Making of' documentary. If you like this movie then you'll not be disappointed. I live in the UK by the way and had no player issues.
0452289963|4.0|The subtitle of the book could very well have been \\"Pimp My Philosophy.\\" He takes his nice, simple, Presence and Pain-Body philosophy and adds a stereo, flip-flop paint job, and 26\\" rims.    There is a lot of woo that you have to sift through, throw out, and/or reword to make those parts reasonable.    Here are a few samples:    He writes about everything being manifested from the One Life or One Consciousness, including crystals, flowers, etc. He expands the definition of \\"enlightened\\" to include: crystals are enlightened stones, flowers are the enlightenment of plants, etc.    I believe his logic on immortality is: you don't have a life, you /are/ a life. Since you cannot lose what you did not have, you can't lose your life, therefore, your life is immortal.    He believes good things vibrate at a higher frequency than bad things, tangible things vibrate at a frequency lower than that.  He also speaks of people who aren't transforming the world and doing big things (contemplatives) as \\"frequency holders.\\" \\"Their function is to anchor the frequency of the new consciousness on this planet.\\"    He believes the Universe is a consciousness the same as us. Its outer purpose is to create form and experience the interaction of forms. Its inner purpose is to awaken to its formless existence.    End of samples.    Some of the things he talks about can be reworded (dewooification?) and made plausible or proven. For instance, he posits that pain-bodies attract other pain-bodies of like frequency. In other words, misery loves company, birds of a feather stick together, etc.    He touches lightly on things like anorexia, bulimia, addiction, etc. One thing that troubles me is, I think his short treatment of abusive relationships should have included a blatant \\"Get out.\\" message, but it did not.    There is good content here though. Being present. How the pain-body and ego work. Discovering your inner purpose. Essentially the things he talks about in the videos on YouTube.    Overall, I'm glad I read it, and have a couple of parts I will go back and reread.

0385732554|4.0|The Giver     \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry is a great book and is well deserving of the Newbery medal. The giver is a one of a kind book. Lowry has created a unique world that people will not forget. This book is a success. In my estimation anyone would like this book regardless of maturity and aptitude level. Before I started I didn't think I would like the book but once I started reading I really got into the story. How do you picture a perfect world? Reading this book will give you a whole new perspective.     I have never read a book in which the setting was more important to the story than The Giver. All though none of us have ever lived in a world the slightest bit similar to the setting in the book from the way Lowry precisely and specifically describes it you feel like you are right there. In this perfect world there is no pain or fear and you always feel secure. Everyone lives in \\"Sameness\\", there is no color, no different weather, and the ground is always flat. Everyone in the town is assigned a job. You don't get to pick who you marry and the only people that can have children are birthmothers. You are given children if you apply for one and the council of elders thinks you would be good parents. If you get a child you don't even get to pick what its name will be that is also decided by elders. There are virtually no choices and no worries. Without this special world it would be an average book at best.      When the book starts out Jonas and the rest of his age group are preparing for the ceremony of twelve where they will receive the assignment that they will have until they are too old to work. When the day of the ceremony comes Jonas is both nervous and excited but when it is his turn to receive his assignment he is skipped over and they go on to the next person. Jonas didn't why and sat there in shame. Finally, after everyone else received their job the chief elder calls Jonas up to the stage. She tells him he has been selected to be the receiver of memory and will be trained by the Giver. It is the most honorable and dangerous job in the community. Jonas had no idea what was in store for him.        In the beginning Jonas is an oblivious eleven year old boy but as the book goes on he transforms into a very wise thirteen year old. He is a difficult character to relate to. There are times, such as when he gets annoyed with his father for calling him \\"Jonas-Bonus\\", that you can relate to. But one thing you can't relate to is that until he became the receiver of memory he had never lied in his life. That's what all the children are taught so that's what they do. Overall Jonas is likeable but not my favorite character. Liking him of disliking him had no effect on how I felt about the book. Most of the time you believe that Jonas will succeed and that he will be a great receiver of memory. But sometimes it seems like he will fail because he feels pain and contemplates quitting.   On a scale of one to ten I would give this book a nine. Whether the Giver sounds like a book you would enjoy or not I would recommend that you read it. If you want to know what happens to Jonas and if he will succeed you will just have to read the book and find out.
B001F9Y2CM|5.0|Purchasing all their albums in one shot makes life easier and cheaper. Of course not every song was a hit, but their are a lot of songs I like better than some of their biggest hits. You will never hear them if you buy their greatest hits albums. I took 57 of the 99 songs and put them on a CD. 58% of the songs I absolutely think are great. That's a good ratio. I've been listening to these guys since they came out in the early 70's and I'm a Headbanger. Beatiful voices and excellent song writing made these four superstars. This is the best way to get all the songs.

B001I82RVS|1.0|Let someone you dont like rent this first. This was just about one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life. it became less about watching the movie for enjoyment and more about making mysekf sit through it out of principal that i actully PAID for this trash.  I dont know how this got soo many good reviews.  It doesnt deserve them.  I think its all a big prank put together by a bunch of friends to convince poor suckers like me to actully buy the movie and then be blind sided by just how bad this movie is.  Good job guys it worked!  I had no idea it would be this bad.... Please dont buy this.
0321544080|4.0|This was an interesting read. The stories around people and locations of pictures presented will help the newcomer to photography anticipate the job of photography. There were comments on lighting and staging, but it was not a 'how-to' book on those topics or camera settings.
B0002DKCMG|5.0|Saw it on TV a had to get a copy. I am actually from Bratislava, and this movie gave me an idea for a tourist T-shirt: \\"I SURVIVED BRATISLAVA. IN WINTER!\\" or something like that :-)
B000VFGQUC|5.0|I was thrilled that a full concert DVD was available of a show by the classic lineup, I had seen clips here and there and thought \\"where the heck is that whole show?\\" The London's Rainbow Theatre performance is really great to see, with camera work that is straightforward yet dynamic, which is the best way to see footage of a strong rock band. I did, however, have a problem with the audio on that part of the DVD. I don't know if I would describe it as muddy, but the instruments don't penetrate. I felt like I had to strain to make out the guitar solos and then it dawned on me that I was straining a bit to hear any individual part. It didn't wreck the experience for me, but didn't turn me on to death either. I don't have 5.1, maybe it sounds better in that. Performance-wise it was a gas to see that lineup with a really dynamic Phil jamming his bass around like all the pics we love.    The footage of the lineup with John Sykes was very, very cool to see. Sykes is on par with Gary Moore for chops and played with a lot of enthusiasm. The songs from Thunder and Lightning were welcome to hear too, those tunes have really grown on me, and add to the scope of Phil's writing catalog. The sound was a lot better to my ears than that on the Rainbow Theatre footage. I very much appreciate getting this footage for the price of the DVD which ostensibly geared toward the Rainbow Theatre.    The interviews and video extras were also a gas. The interview section is pretty robust, really enjoyed hearing some of the stories about the making of the Live and Dangerous album release and the band in general. I had some of the TV clips on VHS and was glad to get them pristine on DVD.    NOTE, on all the performance and interview footage I had to manually put the sound settings on stereo, the default is 5.1 and was muted on my system. At first I thought something was wrong with the DVD. The audio in the menus was on all the time for me. Now that I know that have to put the audio setting on stereo I'm not having problems.    All in all this DVD is a must-have for Thin Lizzy fans, what an incredible value for the money. I'm so glad this material was made available.
0385340990|5.0|This book is like taking a peak into the life of an ordinary woman. You get this feeling because the book is a collection of letters which makes the information so much more personal. The story is compelling and at times heart breaking all with a tone of hope. I loved it.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|I saw this on stage when the traveling show came to Philly, and it works much better when the characters can sing. Pierce Brosnan shouldn't be singing in a movie, and I just don't get the casting of Meryl Streep as Donna. Sophie is supposed to be a 20 year old, and Donna was supposed to be young when she got pregnant and should be 40 years old or less. Streep is getting close to 60, so that was bad casting.   Having said that, I got this for my daughter, and have had to sit through it probably 20 times now, so the singing isn't bothering me as much as it did at first, but the casting still doesn't work for me.
0439806119|4.0|This book, although not as good as some YA I've recently read (Unwind and Hunger Games, for instance) is still worth reading. The story is fast moving and message conveyed is positive. Characters are a little flat and ending seemed somewhat forced, but I am ready for the next installment nevertheless.
0446401307|4.0|This is the 13th entry in the Harry Bosch series. While a much shorter version of his novels than usual, Connelly does his usual terrific job of snaring you and reeling you into the mystery so the pages fly by.<br /><br />Harry is now in the Homicide Special Squad; a squad to handle cases that may be long running or have a special difficulty attached. With his new rookie partner, Ignacio Ferrras, Harry is assigned the case of Dr. Stanley Kent, who appears to have been murdered execution style. When it appears that radioactive material is involved the FBI as well as Homeland Security get involved in the case. Soon Harry is getting pushed out of the case, setting off a cat and mouse game between the various agencies. The government is only interested in the radioactive material and its ties to terrorists; Harry wants to solve the homicide. The appearance of a former flame of Harry's just adds to the intrigue.<br /><br />A very fast read, I read it in one day and really enjoyed it, clever plotting and some surprise twists made for a good mystery. Also there is a phone number in the book and if you call it you get Harry Bosch's answering machine! Really!!
B001O9CDEM|4.0|I'm one of those people who picked this book up in response to have seeing the movie and, quite surprisingly, there is much different between the two. If you are looking for a lighthearted, fun, and energetic time--I'd go with the movie because it skims over much of the detailed misery in the book. However, if you are looking for a realistic and somewhat agonized portrayal of a middle-aged singleton, then this is the book for you.     The pace of the book is more prolonged than the movie, and there is much more to the relationship between Daniel and Bridget. By the time bridget was back on her two feet again, the book was nearly over and I wondered how the author would wind it up with Darcy. Perhaps this is the reason she supported it with a sequel strongly adhered to that aspect of her life.     The reason I give it a four star is because it's somewhat difficult to read about a person who is going through a time in her life everyone has experienced sometime or the other. You know, that period of life where you hate yourself to such a degree that you're on a perpetual rampage of self improvment? It's excruciating to read sometimes, although recommendable.
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|\\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" raises the bar on the cute quotient! I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie theater grinning. I laughed through several parts of the film and the happy ending was just right.     I'm definitely getting this movie for my parents. They are an older couple who seldom go to movies because they cannot stomach the language and content of most films; so \\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\\" is perfect for them.  Although the movie was about a lost dog, it wasn't so sad or overly dramatic that I would be afraid to take a young child to see it. There are absolutely zero swear words, and the movie is just plain fun, whether you are 6 or 60.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This season is very good, you just can't seem to be able to stop watching it. Would definitely recommend it for you viewing pleasure at any time.
B0015KO52S|5.0|LOL all you computer geeks!!<br />Here we are in another century and you're still thinking about Puns and Poses while the real world smells flowers... I appreciate this album...better with every spin and even when it began....it's part of the plan... to move on past the make... we create...stimulate... we don't hate..... SO WHAT!!?? - Give us a break.....<br /><br />This might be THE BEST Jack White compilation EVER!!!<br /><br />It's MY Favorite off-white all around album...<br /><br />Highly Recommended
B0001AVZA8|5.0|This romantic comedy is great and almost a classical one. Performances are great but the script is even better. Even though the DVD is quite simple and do not include any additional interesting material that would have completed the product, the movie by itself deserves to be part of all collections.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves action and Christian Bale as Batman.  It is highly entertaining and gets better with repeated viewings.  Heath Ledger is phenomenal as The Joker - an unforgettable performance from an unforgettable actor.  You will not be disappointed!
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Black Christmas has always sat on my list of must-see movies. Granted, I saw the remake when it originally came out, and that peaked my interest just a bit, yet I still never got around to it. It wasn't until a friend of mine whose critical mind I respect told me to finally sit and watch it that I did just that.      I was pleasantly surprised. It is the total and complete opposite of it's remake. There is no outlandish gore, no silly incoherent back story, no ... well, the only thing to two have in common are the title, the setting, and some character names.      Most know the story; a sorority house is constantly plagued with sexually crazed & threatening phone calls from \\"Billy.\\" Not thinking much about them, they go on about their daily routines. It's not until a few sisters begin disappearing that they take note of what's going on.     It was stated in the films extras and in many reviews of the film that classic slashes such as Halloween & When A Stranger Calls took many vices from this film. Black Christmas is the start-all of the slasher genre. I'd say that it a respectful title for the film.      I was actually surprised that there were a few moments when I jumped at a scare or two (possibly three), and that some of Billy's phone antics actually gave me chills. It's been a while that movie has been able to do that. It's silly to think that Bob Clark, director, went on to be the one to direct Baby Geniuses 2. He handled all aspects of his film with grace, and showed what a true horror film should be right up until the ominous ending. And thankfully, writer Roy Moore didn't give us a motive as to Billy's doings. Billy was just a figure whose identity is never given nor shown (making him an even creepier substance) and whose motives are never thrown into our face. He's just there, and one had hope he isn't.     The performances here aren't Grade A performances, but they worked. Olivia Hussey is a beauty. She's about as real as one can get (Laurie Strode competitor? Possibly). Her \\"Hello\\"s did nerve me a bit. She got so demanding when she answers the phone, even if she doesn't know if it's Billy. Margot Kidder is amazing, and the lines she had are classic. Marian Waldman (rest in peace) - Mrs. Mac - is just as classic. The alone moments with Ms. Mac had me loving the lady each time. And seeing John Saxon in a police jackets gets me every time. The rest of the cast (oh, Andrea Martin, I love you and your slight fro') deliver exactly what needed to be delivered.     It sort of saddens me that I'm having to compare the original to the remake as opposed to having to compare the remake to the original, but I believe it has made me appreciate the original so much more.
0375707972|4.0|I have to admit that I picked up this book because of the movie and the Academy Award nominations.  I haven't seen the movie, but after finishing to book, I will make sure that I do.   Bernhard Schlink wrote a beautiful novel that is told by one of the main characters, Michael Berg.   When he is 15 he falls ill with tuberculosis and has to be away from school for a long period of time.  One day he meets Hannah and everything in his life changes.  He not only begins a very illicit affair with her, he begins to read to her.  It is then that readers see that Hannah has secrets.  Hannah disappears Michael's world changes forever.  As the story goes on, readers see Michael grow up, go to college, marry and have a child of his own.  But he is still conflicted about his relationship with Hannah.  Eventually he starts to learn her secrets when she is being tried for a terrible crime against Jewish prisoners that occurred at the end of World War II.    The story is beautifully told, and yet very sad and tragic.  For anyone that is interested in historical fiction, WWII, the Holocaust, or looking for a good book--this one is highly recommended.
B00003CXCQ|2.0|The DVD worked well, and the cover was good but it did not include the slip cover (which I really wanted). The fact that this was missing should have been included in the description.
067144901X|5.0|I bought it for my 6 month old boy. He loves it because as I read it I actually make the sounds the animals make. Cute book to read to your infant and toddler.
B0001I561E|2.0|It was advertised as in Used-Like New condition. definitely not. Yes the DVD I'm sure worked but the cover was all bent and ripped. Description did not say anything about such heavy wear and tear to cover. And it didn't come with slip cover -- that should have been noted. I had to sent it back.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I did not get to see it because I could not find a DVD machine that played the \\"HD\\" format DVD's.
B0018QQQKS|5.0|Have you ever skimmed through the channels and found something on the History Channel that may seem like a boring topic but the show is captivating?  That's what this book is.  I read the ebook version on Ereader (I purchased the book before I bought the Kindle 2).      I wondered why banking and finance has so many Jews, and why Jewish people are demonized throughout history.  This books explains the history behind this phenomenon. From street vendors in Medieval Italy up through the financial crisis today, this summarizes the pros and cons of banking systems, the gold standard, Keynesian and Austrian economics, and more, all in and entertaining not too dumbed down but not too technical detail.    A definite buy if you, like me, are not educated in economics but are mystified at our current crisis and the black magic that is banking.
B001BJ6918|5.0|This is unique, a film unlike any I've seen before. It features either calm discussions (most of the film) or intense, insane action. Most of the film, surprisingly, is talk...and I found the conversations fascinating.  This movie also looks fantastic on Blu-Ray......a real treat for the eyes.    After the ultra-violent Kill Bill Vol. 1, this movie was shock. There is no shouting in here, no yelling, just a few very sick killers with good vocabularies talking to one another. It sounds boring, but it wasn't to me. Even the trailer-trash lowlife played by Michael Madsen, had a good way with the words.    The violence in here is not that prevalent, and it's not the brain- numbing kind that made up most of the Vol. 1 in this two-part story.     Yeah, I liked this stylish film. It's good storytelling, and it's definitely one to get on Blu-Ray.
0810994739|5.0|My 10 year old boy, who doesn't paticularly like to read, came home from school one afternoon asking if I'd purchase a book for him. Curious, I asked what book. He said a friend of his showed him Diary of a Wimpy Kid of which he read a little and really liked. So we went to the Internet to investigate this book. Turned out there is a series and of course my son wanted them all. With a boy seemingly anxious to read I took the opportuninty and ordered all three. His enthusiasm didn't waver as he waited for them to arrive. Each day, after school, checking the front porch for a box. Once they arrived he ripped into them and started reading that night. Three weeks later he's finished two and wrapping up the third. I too took the opportunity to read them all. I found them relatable, easy to read and funny. Great for the boy who doesn't like to read.
B00003CXXS|5.0|This final episode in the Jurassic series did not deserve all the bad reviews it got when it was released. In fact, it was a lot more enjoyable than the stupid second JP. Did it equal the first? No, of course not. The original story was easily the best of the three, but I found this an enjoyable movie and far better than what I had been led to believe.    The filmmakers were smart in making this a short film. People had seen plenty of the dinosaurs by now so let's no overdo it...and they didn't with an film just under an hour-and-a-half (not including the final credits.).    That made this short-and-sweet. We saw some new reptiles, had a few scares, enjoyed the beautiful jungle scenery (filmed in Hawaii) and - bang - it's over. The characters were fine, nobody totally annoying as in the second film. The lulls featured a family getting back together and finding their missing teen. Nothing wrong with that.    A good story unfairly maligned and nice, short evening of entertainment.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Impressed with the song selection and overall performance. One Of These Nights, Hotel California and other classic hits are featured. The solo tunes are done well and it was a pleasant surprise to see Joe Walsh playing James Gang material!

B000MCH5P4|3.0|There's a profound sense of dread throughout this that makes the viewer fear what is coming next. It's not a horror film, though horrific things happen. It doesn't make for comfortable viewing. And it takes awhile for the tapestry that links the three disparate stories to come together. Impressive film-making, I guess, and the captions add to the authentic feel. The message: a feel good theme about home and family. Brad Pitt doesn't have a lot to do here, though he's billed as the star. Others in the film make much more of a splash, such as the Latinos and the Japanese.
B000YJA660|5.0|An excellent and relevant book in today's time and age. Reiterates the teachings of old and all major religions. Points to the one truth that all words lead to. Easy to understand and implement. Interesting and cleansing. The Truth.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|It is an entertaining tv series,( that's why I gave it a 2 instead of 1) yet, if you have read the books and expect it to be as good as the books, you'll be disappointed.     1) it is nothing like the book, the books are so much better, i)jason is not an idiotic man ho like it's portrayed in the tv series. ii)the subplot of tara and her mom is not in the book. iii) in the book, vampire blood is not treated as a drug in the book, it doesn't give you stupid, over-the-top erection for one thing.    2) Anna paquin is extremely annoying, she over-acts everything, and whats wrong with her accent? I have no idea why she won the Golden Gobe. I love her performance in 'the piano'. but in true blood, it's simple hard to watch.    3) I love sexy and steamy sex scenes so don't get me wrong. But there's just too much of it, to a point where I find it unnessecary and silly
0061537934|5.0|I loved this book!  Anyone who loves dogs will enjoy and relate to the story and perspective.  Also, the author cleverly wove racing experiences into the story.  Good ending also.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|To enjoy this movie it helps to have an interest in Psychoanalytic concepts: the imperious erotic drive, dreams, fantasy, seduction, guilt, erotic curiosity, the distortion of reality by wish and fear, and the fascinating challenge of figuring out the mystery of what exactly happened to you and why. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this movie. The movie's title seems to refer to the power of the sensual and visual experiences of your mind's eyes.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|I am not a huge baseball fan, and I didn't expect to love this book. I ended up falling in love with it. Why?    Moneyball isn't about baseball, baseball is merely the setting. It is a business story, in which the protagonists champion an unpopular idea and exploit the inefficient player market. Lewis' financial background is a great boon to the book, the language of finance describes the market for players perfectly.     It also enriched me as a casual fan of the game. Who knew I'd overvalued fast runners, good fielding, and the stolen base? And, like the other teams in the story, I'd never bothered to ask \\"Why?\\"
B000OQF6N6|1.0|I got this album and just dropped it onto my ipod.  Every once in a while, I would hear a song play that would make me think \\"what is this god-awful song?\\"  I would light the thing up and there would be the statue of liberty.  Pumpkins have gone seriously downhill ever since Siamese Dream.  I eventually just deleted the entire album.  Atrocious.
1591841992|5.0|Very clear, well written with inovative approach in visual thinking. A real solution to present ideas.
0786948523|2.0|I played D&D through every edition since the beginning: basic, expert, AD&D, 2nd, 3.0, 3.5, and now 4th. I've stayed true to the original D&D, never straying to other game developers, never wanting to.     WotC has achieved the impossible, with 4th ed. they have lost yet another loyal player. Its amazing how a company can so misunderstand its core customers. In creating 4th ed. WotC no doubt tried to get some of those lucrative World of War Craft kids on board - heavy on the fighting, light on the role play, but while they will never be able to become a true substitute for online gaming, they've managed to lose their core constituents, the role players.     I wont go into detail about what I hate about the new game because many on this page already do this quite well. Let me just say that I and 6 of my fellow gamers went into 4th with an open mind. We all hoped that WotC had listened to player's feedback about 3.5. We LIKED the game but want SIMPLIFICATIONS to make it MORE PLAYABLE! What we did not ask for is a completely new game focused on miniture, board-gaming with generic, cookie-cutter, super hero characters (let alone emo-races and Puff the magic dragons running around).     Some rules have been streamlined and the daily, encounter and at-will powers are smart changes but overall the game has become even more complex, not less. The powers are as ridiculous as some of the advanced feats in 3rd ed. except now thats ALL anyone concentrates on...thats the core of combat. Its irrelevant if a fighter attacks with a sword, an ax, or a chicken drumstick - all that matters is the funky power he unleashes...Double-Boarhead-Super-Doublefisted-Power-Strike anyone? MY group and I spent hours each game debating each damn square moved like some crazy lawyers debating constitutional law. Every battle, no matter how trivial lasts hours...where is the room to role play. Not to speak of DM-fatigue with the poor guy struggling through pages of combat stats for each individual monster.     This is a game no one wanted, at least not in my crowd. What we have always enjoyed about D&D was that it was a revival of the old tradition of storytelling. Its strength was the flexibility, not being confined to a board or a PC software. The imagination was the limit, at the risk of sounding corny. This is lost in 4th. And honestly, for mindless hack and slay robots, a PC or Xbox game beats D&D anytime. I dont need to get together with my friends for that.     So after some 25 years of playing we have decided as a group to abandon WotC and to move on to Paizo's Pathfinder which promises to build on the d20, 3.5 D&D rules. I hope Paizo will know how to streamline 3.5 without giving up the essence of a great game. To WotC I can only say, good job -losing faithful cutomers is as difficult as gaining them. You certainly proved that you can do the first.
B001IZGPJG|3.0|I'm an Enigma fan since the beginning, and always have appreciated the DVD releases. Generally, they compliment the albums in a unique fashion. In my opinion E1, E4 and E7 are the best Enigma albums- so naturally when E7 was released on DVD I was ecstatic! Once the DVD arrived I was a little disappointed- hardly any original content.  The entire DVD was full of recycled clips from E1 - E4 music videos and the commentary from Michael Cretu was the exact same as the one I downloaded on iTunes when I purchased the album. At least the DVD wasnt an hour long kalidescope like the E6 DVD... but still, EMI and Virgin Records could have done much, much better.
0425166805|4.0|OK first off everyone that was 12 and read the book re-read the book or rent the video.  Erich von Daniken, simply shows proof that things are two perfect back 4,000 - 10,000 years ago.  The Mexico ruins present a calendar that is nearly perfect to a calendar of today, 365 1/4 per year yet they had no telescopes.  He goes on to simply show that drawings around the world from 1,000's of years ago resemble people with spacesuits and ships that fly.  Shows that 20,000 ton rocks where moved over 100 miles from quarries, feats which today, aren't quiet possible.  Most ancient text write about an instance of crafts that fly.    He simply just goes around to world sites and shows you things that today, are still consider VERY hard to do.  The pyramid which resembles 3.14 when you divide it.  The drawing from over 1,000 years ago that shows what NASA would provide from an above earth shot over Egypt and Antarctica.    And the fact that in our own milky way galaxy, there are 50,000,000 stars that have the potential of supporting life similar to earth.  Then when you read on the hubble telescope web site that there are HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS of galaxies, and a high estimate of around 500 BILLION galaxies, which could each contain millions of stars the chance that at least 1 other planet got an earlier start then earth is no so far fetched and more likely very probable...    So when reading his book or watching the video, he just shows you similarities around the world that are near impossiable to do today with out modern equipment and tons of money, yet alone 1,000 years ago.    In closing I thought the best part of the move was that during the world wars, the united states went to some 3rd world island in the pacfic, and built a runway for the jets, when they were finished they just left and teh villages, have since built a plane out of bamboo, and made a simlar runway and watch the sky waiting for the gods to return...  just read the book with an open mind
B00000ILBK|4.0|i really like this one it has all the good actors in it.It is alittle different than the other shows but is good i feel.I am not into the tv series of Star Trek but i do like all the other movies they did and i like this one also.

B0007KLH1Y|5.0|When my kids start play with Kapla Blocks everything shouts down! They work so quietly, for a long time. This toy gives them the freedom to create and stimulates their imagination more than any other toy we've ever had. This blocks look so good when assembled and that gives them a sense of accomplishment that no other \\"perfect toy\\" could give.  My nephew (he's an 11 year old gifted child) says this is the best gift he's ever received.  Play a little with your child with these blocks, just to show them how fun it is to create, and then they'll be on their own!
1594201927|5.0|Mr. Ferguson's book is an interesting overview of the stock and bond markets from the beginning to present day.  It is for the general reader and will help him understand the mechanics of finance. As a companion to this book I recomend \\"It Takes a Pillage\\".  This would make a good bingo game prize.

B000TLMWLK|5.0|Awesome, just awesome!  It was so nice to see him young and strong and as confident as he has always been.   It took me right back to sitting on the living-room floor with a soda pop, popcorn, and the rest of the family (all 10 of us!).  Johnny Cash is, and always will be, a national treasure!    ...........and the others on the DVD were great too.  Back in the day when teeth weren't straightened or whitened, there was no lazer eye corrections, and the future *stars* looked like they were playing at the local fair.  That's AMERICA right there!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I thought this DVD was pretty good. I like how it has three different levels and you can choose to do one, two, or three at a time. The workouts definitely get your heartrate up and provide good muscle toning. Some of the moves are tougher to get at first, but after a little practice, they are quite do-able. My only complaint is that Jillian relies a bit too much on jumping techniques for cardio, which is hard on the knees. I can't do this DVD on consecutive days for that reason.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|I love this album. I discovered my love of Sara Bareilles through Pandora Radio (the music genome project). Previously, the only song of hers I'd heard was \\"Love Song\\" on the radio. I liked it Ok, but wasn't totally like \\"OMG I must get her album!\\" On Pandora, however, I heard other songs of hers on the album and *then* was hooked. \\"Love Song\\" is still not my fave song on the album and I think she would have won the Grammy for best single if \\"Vegas\\" had been released instead. But that's just my opinion. Basically, I think she has a beautiful and strong voice and I love this album.
0446579939|5.0|I have read all of Spark's books and altho sometimes, I feel he is too mushy and that things end in a very sad fashion, I still am drawn to his writing.  After reading this, and I did find it very satisfying, I read the memoir of his life and it just seemed to give me a better insight into the man putting these stories out there.  This has a nice twist at the end and was worth the read.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|First of all, I always regarded the original 'Let It Be' as the bottom of Beatles albums.  Sure it had great music (it was, after all, still The Beatles) but Phil Spector really squashed it. \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is the worst example of this.<br /><br />But the new version is good - as good as it can be considering that the band didn't care for the whole thing and were busy breaking up at the time.  I now put \\"The Long and Winging Road\\" WAY up on my list of fav tracks.  Some reviewers call this a demo-type recording, but this is the way Paul intended it to sound, and I have always agreed with him (this take is the one heard in the orginal film and also shown the the Anthology DVD).  \\"Across The Universe\\" is FANTASTIC!  I'm so glad we get to hear John's vocal at the correct speed.  It was slowed down on the original Let It Be, and speeded up on Past Masters Vol 2 (the so-called 'Wildlife version').<br /><br />I was disappointed in the 'free' disc.  Where was the oft-bootleged 'Suzy Parker' (I LOVE that strange little tune!)  As for the rest we only get snippits - no major revalations.  Perhaps it would have been better to inlcude a remastered version of the planned \\"Get Back\\" album as a bonus.  This may be the most bootleged album of all time and it STILL has not appeared offically.<br /><br />\\"Let It Be Naked\\" is a worthy re-do.  As for the remixing, I have been one of those geeks who's collected Beatles alternate mixes for years (from diffrent odd-and-sod collections throughout the world) so these 'official' alternates are like finding gold!<br /><br />BEATLES FOR EVER!
B0017VG69U|5.0|What more can be said, The original Star Trek is the best show ever shown on TV, now it is even better.  I have already watched the Doomsday Machine 3 times so far.  Just wish they had extended the space battles, maybe they will do a special edition one day.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I have to say that this video really captures the live concert experience!  I saw Rush perform their Snakes and Arrows tour twice last year at the Excel Energy Center in Minneapolis.  Both were the best experiences.  This video captures that experience over and over again.  Come and see my band:  Burning Chrome, we produce that live rock experience in the greater twin cities.

B000002UAF|4.0|When it comes to straight pop, Paul McCartney writes better--catchier, anyway--than John Lennon.  \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is all about straight pop--but most of the songs are Lennon compositions.  The result is more pointed than \\"With the Beatles,\\" which is good, but less exciting than that album or its predecessor.  Most exciting are the hits: the title track and \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"
B00005O5CM|3.0|Only someone as gifted as Reese Witherspoon could pull off this adorable but ludicrous fantasy movie. Fantasy is what it is, and that's ALL that it is. There are definitely some funny scenes and it's diverting. The idea that it presents a good message for girls about working to achieve goals and being true to yourself, though . . . I have to warn you, girls in our daughter's high school were saying they wanted to be lawyers because this movie made a legal career seem fun and glamorous and exciting. Our daughter told them, \\"Are you crazy? My parents are lawyers. I KNOW better.\\" I suppose at some sad level, being inspired to attend law school by Elle Woods is no more naive than being inspired to attend law school by Atticus Finch, but at least Atticus Finch lost his big case. Don't be fooled. Even if you enjoy the intellectual challenge and have pleasant colleagues and are lucky enough to handle an occasional case that affects public policy or helps someone with a problem, law is mostly a lot of hard work under mountains of paper with cases dragging on for months or years and ending in settlements where justice is neither entirely served nor entirely undermined. That's assuming you don't do family law which is truly from hell. Unless you're at the very top of the food chain, it's not even all that remunerative. The lawyers who make the most money usually represent the most unsavory clients. Lawyers have very high rates of depression and substance abuse compared to the general population. And nobody wears hot pink suits with stilettos and accessory dogs to court. So have fun, laugh, enjoy the talented cast, but please don't base a career decision on this movie.
B000002UAI|4.0|The Beatles' fourth was rushed out in time for Christmas, and it sounds it.  McCartney and Lennon try to build from their admiration of Bob Dylan.  Additionally, Lennon crafts some pleasant little pieces of self-loathing (see especially \\"I'm a Loser\\").  The album as a whole is thin; the music is unexciting, save for the aggression in \\"No Reply.\\"  As soon as the record ends, I'm reaching for \\"[[ASIN:B000002UA9 Please Please Me]].\\"

B000A2IPP0|5.0|There is a moment in the film where actor Peter Coyote looks at young Elliott (played magnificently by Henry Thomas) and says \\"I've been wishing for this since I was 10 years old\\" and I think that really sums up why this movie is so incredibly special.  This is a dream come true for every young boy and precisely why watching this movie is such an enjoyable experience.  Recently my wife and I sat down to watch this movie again and she told me she felt the movie was horrible.  I sat there with this blank stare and she said that she doesn't know why she ever liked the movie in the first place. Again, I resort back to my initial quote.  This is a dream come true for every `young boy' and that dream never dies; that is why even as adults a man can thoroughly enjoy this film.<br /><br />I won't say that woman cannot; but I think it has a totally different meaning to the male gender.<br /><br />This may be Steven Spielberg's finest film, and it possibly serves as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is certainly the greatest science fiction movie I've ever seen.  The wonderful thing about `E.T.' is that it becomes a part of the audience; a major part.  It's one of those films that invests itself in your heart; tapping into your emotions and reaching that inner person.<br /><br />It's a film that truly feels like a dream come true.<br /><br />When the film opens our heart is immediately touched when we see the oddly shaped E.T. running for his life as he watches his family leave him behind.  E.T. is lost, here on planet earth, with no where to run.  When he meets young Elliott, the two bond instantaneously over similar situations.  Young Elliott is struggling to adjust in a broken home; his father having recently walked out on his mother, and so both feel almost trapped.<br /><br />They find escape in their oddly matched friendship, and we find escape in watching that friendship grow.<br /><br />One of the beautiful things that propels `E.T.' into the catalogues of greatness is the sincerity of it all.  Young Henry Thomas is just a wonderment here; capturing every genuine feeling and emotion that anyone in his predicament would be feeling; from a nervous fear to an ecstatic curiosity to sympathy and love.  In fact, the entire cast captures those emotions beautifully.  Drew Barrymore gives a very solid performance as Elliott's equally captivated sister Gertie.  She exudes this warmth and spontaneity that just makes her so infectious.  There is a scene towards the end where her genuine concern for E.T.'s survival is exhibited in her outburst of tears; a scene that is so moving thanks to her connection to the material.  Both of these young actors give awards worthy performances here.<br /><br />It's no wonder that this movie became an instant hit and has remained a favorite of many even today.  It's such a beautifully told story; complete with a well written script, stellar performances and a very steady hand by Spielberg.  He crafts a sheer masterpiece here; no ifs, ands or buts about it.eatness is the sincerity of it all.

B00005NB8K|4.0|While the fans of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin wait endlessly for film bios of their Rock `n' Roll hero's Doors fans have long had the bio-pic of Jim Morrison courtesy of Oliver Stone.<br /><br />I gave this review four stars, but for the movie itself it's only three stars the fourth star is for the bonus features. The movie starts off well enough with Val Kilmer as Jim Morrison in a recording studio reading his poetry (\\"Did you have a good world when you died? Enough to base a movie on?\\") Then flashes back to Morrison's childhood when he witnessed an accident in the New Mexico desert in which some Indians had been in a car accident and the young Jim Morrison felt as if the soul of one of those Indians leapt into his. Then we pick up Morrison as leaves the UCLA film school to self imposed exile on a Venice Beach rooftop where it's inferred that Morrison was writing. He meets Pam Courson (Meg Ryan) and bumps into former UCLA classmate Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan) who asks Morrison what he's been doing, Morrison answers writing songs, and Manzarek asks him to sing one. Jim sings Moonlight Drive and Ray says they should start a rock band and make a million dollars.<br /><br />The movie closely follows the highlights of The Doors/Morrison's career from playing The Whisky a go-go where the Oedipal section of The End was first heard and got them fired only to be picked up by Elektra Records, to playing the Ed Sullivan Show and being asked by producers to excise the word higher in Light My Fire, Morrison refused, the New Haven concert where Morrison became the first rock star arrested on stage, Miami, his obscenity trial, his Wiccan wedding with Patricia Keneally (Kathleen Quinlan) and one unintentionally hilarious scene where Jim and Pam get into an argument and Jim stomps a duck. There are a lot of cameos in the movie including Doors drummer John Densmore, Billy Idol, Eric Burdon, Paul Williams, and Doors producer Paul Rothchild.<br /><br />The acting is good, although Michael Madsen seems wasted in such a small part of Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's. Oliver Stone gets most of the facts right, and gives a good feel for the 60's and the music. What he doesn't get right is pretty major. Besides directing Stone also gets a credit as screenwriter, but when he runs out of things for Morrison to say he just inserts Doors lyrics, as if Morrison was running around quoting songs all the time. The movie also tends to only portray the sensationalistic side of Morrison's personality, and while I understand film is an active medium there is one scene missing, a scene which shows Morrison sitting and writing the songs.<br /><br />I gave one of the rating stars to the bonus features and this DVD is crammed with bonus features, deleted scenes, commentary, and the rarely seen English documentary The Doors Are Open which was shot on The Doors first European tour in 68.<br /><br />The Doors movie by Oliver Stone may be part of a 60's trilogy. Each third represents a different aspect of the 60's.<br /><br />Platoon-The Vietnam experience.<br />JFK- About the political atmosphere of the 60's and how we lost faith in our leaders because of an alleged conspiracy.<br /><br />And finally The Doors. To illustrate the counter culture experience of the 60's. This movie & JFK have both recieved reviews panning them due to not sticking with the facts. But these 2 movies are also outside of Stone's range of experience so it might have been a little harder for him to internalize the experience and present them to their best effect.asted in such a small part of Tom Baker, a friend of Morrison's.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|Let me start by saying that the chemistry between Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson is magic.  They will not go down in history as being one of the magical couples that graced the silver screen and that is a shame because they should.  They are something that years of training, experience, or practice can not replicate. They just ARE....and they are a joy to watch.    The movie itself is a wonderful combination of bitter and sweet, happiness and sorrow.  I just love it and will watch it at any chance I get.
B000KGGIQY|4.0|Johnny Cash may be known for many things; music, outlaw/rebel personas and more, but his love is as concrete and true as all his other images. The \\"Man in Black\\" with a \\"Freight-Train Voice\\" displays his life-time joys and sorrows that propelled him up inot the music status of Icon. Reese Witherspoon and Joaquin Pheniox both gave a Grammy knock-out preformance, that either has yet to top (I think Joaquin was still in character during Lettermen), in this true tale of love, addiction and music. This may not be a Film of the Ages, but it surely is a fine trubute to Mr. J.R. Cash.
0684803356|2.0|I listened to this on audio book over several days, it felt like forever. I wasn't too impressed. It was slow, slow, and did I mention slow. Then when it was interesting, it wasn't even worth all the slowness.  Won't be sampling Hemingway again anytime soon.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|I bought this DVD based on the reviews of others, which were very positive. I heartily agree with those reviews in every way. Till this point I have not been a big fan of opera but this DVD changed my mind. I think they were fantastic and can easily listen to them often. I highly recommend this concert.
B000002GWN|2.0|This live album contains most of Joni's hits from the period.  Backed by the Tom Scott's horn section, there are parts of this disk that really rock.  Unfortunately, even with the impressive cast of supporting musicans there is a lack of consistency.  Some of the songs do not translate well in the live format, leaving me wondering if lies in the recording or the artist's live personna.  The LA Express does save some of the arrangements and punches some life into these tunes, but still there is a lack of energy for a live release.
B00140PK6O|5.0|For anyone who just adores cozying up with a well made and acted British miniseries, this one is for you.  On par with Wives and Daughters, North and South, and dare I say perhaps even A&Es Pride and Prejudice, I absolutely enjoyed this.  The acting is superb as is the cast, and the costumes and scenery are beautiful.  I highly recommend this to just about anyone!
B000002KOQ|5.0|This is Joni Mitchell's third release, which shows growing sophistication in composing and writing.  \\"Morning Morgantown\\" is a sparse arrangement of a lovely melody, and lacking the lush layers that follow on later disks.  She stretches a bit from the folksy influences of the first two albums, and begins to exhibit her rocking side.  Her darkness is exhibited on \\"Woodstock\\", where she sings about the \\"bomber death planes riding shotgun in the sky\\".  Three of the tunes on this disk were often covered, including \\"Woodstock\\", \\"The Circle Game\\", and \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\". \\"For Free\\" and \\"Rainy Night House\\" demonstrate some of her more moody composing. This is worth owning, to follow Joni's growth as a songwriter and composer from the previous releases.
B00009APK1|5.0|The item came very quickly and was in the condition promised. Could not have asked for more!

0743454529|4.0|I loved the book. The writing was excellent and boy, does it evoke a kaleidoscope of emotions! I was soo torn throughout the book (yet silently cheering Anna on)...only to be devastated at the end. If I was the type to cry at books, I would have cried reading this one. Really touching. 2 thumbs up.
B000002U8G|4.0|Pink Floyd-Meddle ****<br /><br />Admittedly not the biggest Pink Floyd fan I must say though that out of all the PF albums I own and have heard which is nearly all of them, Meddle is my second favorite, and might be in my opinion PF greatest album.<br /><br />Obviously Meddle is not 100% consistent, 'San Tropez' and 'Seamus' destroy that, but it is by far the groups most consistent album. Not only that but it is by far the groups most cohesive.<br /><br />Gilmour's guitar only gives a glimmer of what was to come here. His playing is more subdued than normal and isn't as prominent as on other releases which really helps the album. Wrights key work is really the focal point of the album and is utterly fantastic. The two work together on the epic 'Echoes' to create one amazing sound collage that will haunt you.<br /><br />What might be most impressive is the opening of the album with 'One Of These Days' which is easily the boars tits of the album. The nearly six minute instrumental complete with one of the greatest bass lines in history sets the tone for the rest of the album. Through out their career PF would try to recreate the power of this instrumental but were never able to again.<br /><br />Meddle is might be the only Pink Floyd album that must be heard. It is a near perfect album with the exception of 6:01 just before 'Echoes.' Give it a try.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I have watched this program every time it has been on TV, whether it be HBO or now the History Channel. I've asked for it as a Birthday or Christmas present for years, but never got it. Now, the price is right, and I bought it for myself. And I have already watched it three or four times. Excellent movie and highly recommended!
1416562605|5.0|I don't know how I'd feel about this book if I were Indian. I'm going to check the other reviews on this board. (Turns out a lot of Indians like it, if last names are anything to go by). The Indians in this book are ignorant, corrupt, dishonest or murderous - sometimes all four at the same time. The only Indian who shows idealism (\\"a ray of sunshine\\") is promptly killed. Death and raw sewage are recurrent elements.  In spite of this bleak view of human (at least Indian) nature, the effect is exhilarating and funny.  This is a scathing indictment of a society but is enjoyable to read.            In the tradition of the noir, the author (like Nabokov and Banville, among others) uses a murderer as a first person narrator.. The framing device of the letters to the premier of China was intriguing. I still haven't figured its purpose, and yet it added a dimension to the book.  At the beginning it is a comic device, establishing that the narrator is a poorly educated person, so naïve as to think that the premier will actually read his letter (maybe he will now). Then it becomes a political polemic, establishing that Indian society is unjust and should be changed; maybe become more like China, maybe become more like America.   At the end the purpose is rather lost.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|My friends and I actually had trouble staying awake while watching this movie.  Many things were thrown at you in this movie, but little was ever explained. Cast was annoying and I couldn't have cared less if they survived or not.  The usual story of a group of people trying to escape, finding a safe house, safe house gets raided, people escape to another place, and eventually finding freedom. z  z zzz Again extremely boring the way it all played out in this movie.
B001GQACGE|3.0|disc two is much better than the disc one  disc one is slow and boring to me where as the disc two is more upbeat   i dont see myself playing the disc one too often in my future but im sure disc two will get more attention.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I was sad when I finished the fourth book last night. The series was very entertaining to read.  I would love it if she would continue the series.
0307387178|4.0|This book is fun to read. It makes it much more interesting that it's all based on a true story! It's hard to imagine someone doing all the things that happened in this story.  Makes you turn the pages constantly to find out what happens next.
B00005JKZV|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an outstanding fantasy/action/adventure film about Frodo and Sam heading out to Mordor alone, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli must fight in the Battle of Helm's Deep.    It has an amazing cast including Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Bernard Hill, Miranda Otto, and many more!
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Director Eric Brevig and star Brendan Fraser make a valiant attempt to update Jules Verne's classic sci-fi adventure novel for about the fifth time. No one no matter what the budget or media (TV, film , made for cable/satellite) seems to be able to improve upon the original film starring James Mason. Bregi and Fraser try hard and there are some marvellous moments in the film, but overall the film falls flat about half way through. Wooden performancesby the cast, a lackluster screenplay that bares almost no resemblance to the original Verne work, and 3D effects that don't really look all that three-dimensional in some parts.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The built in flash went bad on out Nikon D50 a couple months ago. I dragged my feet on getting this flash because it seemed expensive --- definetly a good buy if you use one of these DSLR's. It cycles fast, works perfectly with the built in sensors and is small. The ability to bounce the light off of walls makes this flash incredibly superior to the built-in. My pictures never looked better.
B00104W8T6|5.0|The soundtrack to the Indie movie we all loved is amazing.  It is full of sweetness as well as melancholy. This is how I got into indie music and culture and it is a great introduction to anyone interested.  It mixes the awesome Kimya Dawson with the Moldy Peaches and my favorite Belle and Sebastian.  These among others make this album quite adorable and very good to listen to in the car.
B00008AJL5|2.0|I payed the extra money based on reviewers saying crabsody is on this version but it's not.
0440244870|5.0|I bought this book on my way to a beach vacation when I was looking for a no-brainer! It kept me busy on the beach while my kids played in the sun. The author has portrayed the character of Rebecca Bloomwood very well. I myself am a big shopaholic like Rebecca minus the debts...thank God I know to live in my means.  I watched the movie too, but was not as impressed with it, still worth it if you absolutely loved the book and want to meet with the characters!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Michael Jackson meant for the eighties and nineties what Elvis Presley in the middle sixties, a pop icon, a privileged artist who was well aware what it means to have a crowd in the fist. Every single movement at the stage, the suggestive corporal language and the seductive charisma generates a real magic at the stage, an ambiance of bliss, liberation and happiness.<br /><br />This admirable recital proves by far, this magic, supported by a first-rate technology and clever musical numbers that captured your attention from start to finish.<br /><br />The special tracks were \\"Thriller\\" (of course), the sensitive ballad \\"She's out of my life\\"  \\"Beating\\" and the delirious \\"Heal the world\\" where the presence of children of all latitudes of the world (having as background the sphere of the world) tinged the stage of warm humanity.<br /><br />A real tour de force that exposes and resumes the artistic essence of this idol of crowds.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|On the scale of 1 to 100, I'd give it 100. I wish everybody would have watched it in high school. And remember it for the rest of their lives. It is not about \\"how British / Americans/ Russians won the war\\". As Jeremy Isaacs said in his introduction, it is not possible to tell everything about this war. They did the best they could; and these series should be part of the high school curriculum all around the world.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Since the times of \\"Requiem for a heavyweight\\" we had not had the chance to watch such devastating portrait about the comfort of the glory and its bitter counterpart: the relentless forgetfulness.<br /><br />It would be convenient to remark the audacious and courage to make such devastating and touching film around the figure of an old fashioned wrestler who lived his moments of glory in the eighties (the unerring feeling of melancholy that many of us have experienced once we have decided to turn our attention about the past).<br /><br />Ram Robinson (Mickey Rourke) like many others fashion stars business (Do you remember the last moments of Bela Lugosi or Johnny Weissmuller, for instance?), accustomed to live into the pleasant bubble of the slipping world of fame and temporal glory, lives isolated twenty years after, sleeping in a trailer, playing Nintendo and listening music of his fifteen minutes of glory.<br /><br />But when he is aware his body doesn't resist the exigent efforts the wrestling demands (a heart attack), he decides to pursuit the love and affection of his daughter after years and years of abandon. He will try to rejoin with her but there are many obstacles to overcome, barriers of hate and pain. On the other hand, his affective life is empty and so, he will intend to make plans with an exotic night dancer (the alluring Marisa Tomei) to start a new life far from the madding world. But - against all the odds - the ruthless reality will impose itself, regardless his sincere desire of self redemption.<br /><br />The most devastating sequence (to my mind) is when he decides to sign autographs and take some pictures with youngsters, the photograph and the camera preserve the corruption of the time, giving us the elusive sensation of a never ending eternity.<br /><br />Rourke is outstanding like this decaying and once beloved idol. A smart depiction of the meaning of the glory; after having been at the top of the wave and now to be at the edge of the forgetfulness and indifference.
0061191981|4.0|I have been a big fan of Gordon Ramsey's televisions shows, \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", \\"Kitchen Nightmare's\\", and \\"The F Word\\". When I saw this book, I knew I wanted to read it to get to know more about my favorite television chef. Well, the amazing thing is that I actually believe that he wrote this book himself, as he sounds just as he does on television. His personality just jumps out at the reader from the pages of this book.<br /><br />That being said, this book is really a brief biography of his life to date. It has definitely been a hardscrabble life until the past few years, when his hard work finally paid off. Brought up in dire poverty in a totally dysfunctional family with an abusive, alcoholic father, it is amazing to see the success he has made of himself. Gordon paints a candid portrait of himself, and what comes across is a somewhat oafish, hardworking, intelligent and driven individual with some very set ideas and exacting standards. He is definitely a control freak, albeit a likeable one.<br /><br />Those readers who enjoy his shows will most definitely enjoy this book, which is a very easy and quick read. The reader will marvel at the obstacles this passionate man has overcome to reach the pinnacle of success that he has. What one sees on television is what one gets in this book. So, be prepared for some coarse language and a somewhat inelegant writing style, as well as a very frank portrait of one of today's premier chefs.
B00028HBKM|1.0|The worse, the better.That was certainly Gibson s aim. And so many priests from many \\"churches\\" told their flocks  the true story was even more ruthless than Gibson s,for our sins are always bigger than Christ's pain. Guilt is profitable,History knows. The handsome Gibson has become disgusting after this pedestrianly medieval  film. The \\"accuracy\\" of Aramaic and Latin languages scarcely disguises its actual instinct: a sadomaso picture which should be kept inside  X Rated sector.<br /> Convicts received at that time 39 lashes, for the Hebraic law forbade 40 lashes. Romans used to respect local standards. Thus, Pilate washed hands and gave Jesus to Jew High Priest. Gibson was right about Semitic incrimination, in case there is guilt indeed or somebody to be  accused ,once Jehova  has decided to sacrifice His own Son.<br /> Therefore,we should thank  Judas for our redemption. Unforgivably,by all means,  Gibson s bloody-commercial taste is worse than Jason s saw. Let s see this  picture´s prestige in next years.<br /><br />Flavio J  Morsch; Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read a lot of reviews on this video before purchasing, and I have to say...they were all accurate!  This work out video (when used as suggested) works WONDERS!  I did this video almost every day for 30+ days before my wedding and it WORKED!  I definitely recommend this video.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Shocking, disgusting, perverted, fantastic. Salo was a fairly hard movie to watch, but worth at least one go. The messages behind the movie or acts in the movie show very true what those with power have done to todays society with all the greed, coruption and this movie shows what i consider as the true heart of the corrupt.  This movie is very extreme with it messages, and is not for the squeemish. I must say however if you do buy the 2 disk dvd set, to make sure you also watch the extras and understand exactly what Pasolini was trying to do with this masterpiece of cinema.
0471463396|5.0|I had been waiting for an outstanding book like this one for years. I finally found it! The book is divided into two main parts. The first part describes value investing and lays out the foundations on how to go about valuing investments with an emphasis on companies' stocks. The second part describes the approaches of some value investors with the greatest number of pages dedicated to Warren Buffett.     Greenwald et al lay out the principles of value investing in a manner that is basic enough that any intermediate investor can easily follow and yet, unlike many other books, not so basic that is becomes meaningless or insults the readers. There is some basic algebra but nothing too complicated. As Warren Buffett says you do not need to understand complicated math to be a great investor.    The authors also do a great job in explaining why pursuing growth is not a contradiction for value investors. Pursuit of growth strategy may seem at odds with traditional value investing as taught by Ben Graham, but the authors explain the evolution of the discipline clearly. Many criticize value investors as not being really value-oriented when they pursue growth. Value investing can describe different strategies. Two cooks may specialize in Chinese food  but can come up with completely different dishes. This does not mean that one of them is not really cooking Chinese dishes. Similarly there is nothing contradictory about a value investor purchasing a growth stock. I thought the authors did a great job explaining this concept to readers. The second part of this book describes nicely how different cooks specializing in Chinese dishes can cook in significantly different manners.    This is an outstanding book and the authors have done their readers a huge service. Ben Graham's Security Analysis and Intelligent Investor are the bibles for many value investors, but this contemporary book is both more enjoyable and readable. I highly recommend it.

015206396X|5.0|Graceling is a great book that earns 5 stars! It has plot, a hint of love, violence, death, life, and mostly a world that is like none other.<br /><br />I know I liked Graceling for the romance(just a bit). It wasn't lovey-dovey or anything dramatic. It was a real love and that didn't take over the story.<br /><br />The details in Gradeling was well described and the dialogue was written to grab the reader.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to ages 13 and up.
B001KDQ4KQ|1.0|What a huge disappointment! I never expected this writer - who is normally quite good - to produce such a silly and boring piece of work. The entire story is so repetitive, it often felt like she was copypasting whole paragraphs.  The characters are unrealistic in the extreme. Knowing Picoult's work, I expected some sort of a twist, a stunning revelation at the end. But this time there was nothing like that. After finishing this endlessly boring novel, all you can feel is a sense of bewilderment is why any one would want to keep spinning this type of drivel for hundreds of pages. Thematically, the main point of the novel is that parents don't always know what their teenage children actually feel. Why Picoult would think that this triviality is worth spend even more time on is incomprehensible. All in all, this is the worst by this author I have read so far. Actually, it might be the worst I have read in the past few years by any author.<br /><br />[...]

And it also focuses us on trying to create the right environment so more folks can succeed because with the right environment, they CAN. Read it.
0765316897|5.0|The main strength of this series is the magic system. It is much better developed than in any other author's books I've read. It also avoided the problems of many books (such as the Sword of Truth series) where the character has just the right magic to win and it appears at just the right moment. Here the powers are explained in a coherent way and it doesn't feel like cheating just to make the plot work out.    The other main strength is that the plot doesn't follow the usual quest format where the heroes obey the legend and everything works out great. Quite the opposite in fact.    The writing style is very easy to read. Sanderson doesn't get into endless detail, such as the Wheel of Time tends to do, and keeps things moving along.    There are a few good characters: Sazed, Kelsier, Spook in the last book, Vin, Lord Ruler, and Elend. Unfortunately a lot of the other characters are a bit bland.    The beginnings and endings of each of the books is quite good. However the first slumps a little in the middle and the second and third slump a lot. In the middle the characters spend a lot of time doing stuff that ends up not advancing the plot very much, and only in the last few chapters does the plot actually advance.    One thing that is either good or bad about this series, is the way that magic is used is very much in a Matrix style. That would make it easy to translate these books into movies. The down side is I've seen the Matrix, and it is very visual. It doesn't work very well in books and the fight scenes tend to get a bit confusing and exhausting to read.    I think Sanderson has some weaknesses to work on in future books, some of which I mentioned above, but he has a lot of strengths too.    BTW, I would have given this book 4 and a half stars, I prefer to think of 5 stars as a classic. But Amazon doesn't allow that.

0441013074|3.0|Reynolds' Revelation Space universe was an excellent foray into a deep, broad and rich universe with intricate detail, wondrous technology yet with unrealistic dialogue. How does this compare to Century Rain, which does not take place in the Revelation Space universe? It actually manages succeeds where Revelation failed yet failed where Revelation triumphed.<br /><br />The entire novel feels like it has the loose structure of a Golden Age SF novel and many points of the plot reflect this quaintness. If the novel were to be condensed to only 200 pages rather than 600, the special Golden Age effect would have been complete, but we all know that modern British SF can't limit itself to anything less than 500 pages (bless them for it, too). The predictive nature of the novel, too, reflects the poor structure of Century Rain. I was able to predict (with lucky guesses or with my vast intelligence, who knows) about 80% of the unfolding of the plot. Even then, the one or two big swings were mildly surprising. I was never \\"wowed\\" by any plot twist or happening.<br /><br />If Revelation failed in the dialogue category, Century Rain definitely revels in the art of sly humor and deceptive circular logic. His characters can spin words which will leave your own head spinning with impression. It's all believable and without the over drama in which Revelation tended to revel in. It's kept neat and clean when it needs to be but it can also be long and descriptive at the proper plot points.<br /><br />Historical facts and insights are a key value of Century. The living memory of a non-existent 50s Paris is sharp and livid. It's a tried and true alternate universe where WW2 never happened and Reynolds does a surprising decent take on a world where science has taken the back burner to modern jazz. It's a captivating scene for an alternate universe plot and really resonates with the Verity, the traveler/scientist. Her observances of alternate 50's Paris to our real 50's Paris are our lens into the entire plot which Verity and Floyd find themselves tangled in.<br /><br />This should be an excellent novel for some people or a dull one for others. For me it struck right in the middle between mediocrity, finesse and reminiscence. No reason to stop reading the rest of Reynolds' bibliography however!which Verity and Floyd find themselves tangled in.     This should be an excellent novel for some people or a dull one for others.

962634475X|3.0|I liked most of this book, loved some and hated others.  The book is interesting.<br />Julian Barnes has written a work of fiction, that is not really history in the strictest sense of the word.  It is more an examination of Worldviews.  The book is divided up into eleven sections, with the meditation on love being the half chapter in the title.  The book opens with the perspective of a woodworm that slipped onto Noah's ark and gives the story from the animal's perspective.  This story is quite humorous really.  The second story is about a group of history tourists being hijacked by Arabs while on a cruise.  This story is much more intense and sad than the first story.  It is a radical shift in tone and feel of the book.  The book does this over and over.  There is the story of a nuclear attack that really is not.  There is the story of 900 Jews on the St. Louis during the time of Hitler and the final solution.  There is a reflection on the meaning of love that is not at all sappy and is perhaps the best part of the book.  There a several other stories, all of which are good, but one.  The one that I did not like at all was the one about Heaven.  Heaven was almost Hell in Barnes' perspective.  This ending weakened the whole book.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|Great DVD for the collector who enjoys a feature length making-of doc, but I was disappointed that this (from amazon) didn't come with the collector's book.

0930289234|3.0|I was very torn between giving this three and four stars. If I could, I would give it 3.5.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the entire read through. I was absolutely riveted and read it in a day and a half. But I always ask myself a few questions after I finish any kind of book -- would I read it again? Do I regret reading it, even if it gave me a good ride? Was the payoff worth the effort... in short, was the content rewarding enough to justify reading for hours?<br /><br />In the end, I'm glad I read it. I needed a good read and a book that didn't speak to me like I was an idiot. I can also appreciate mastery when I see it -- these characters are so real that I feel I could recognize them if I saw them on the street. In fact, this is very much a character-driven story and is, ultimately, where this graphic novel excels. Frankly, after reading so many books with characters as thin and flimsy as notebook paper, I can't tell you what a relief it is to read about characters as substantial, well-crafted, and richly complex as these. I did not read this graphic novel to find out about the plot; I wanted to know how each character was going to handle their personal crises.<br /><br />But, although I am glad to have read it, I'm not sure I would ever read it again. There's a point where the \\"theme\\" of the book got so loud, so pretentious, that it broke the magic. When a theme starts to swagger about, throwing its weight around like it's the king of the roost, it inevitably begins eclipsing story and character (and as the characters are so excellent and added so much to the theme without even trying, it seemed a sad choice). Quoting Nietzsche and Bob Dylan is fine and dandy, but often it seemed like Moore was saying, \\"Look at how much I know! I'm high-brow; I'm in on all of the important books on the high-brow reading list.\\" How best to put it?... it's like Watchmen couldn't stand on its own two feet. It wanted to shore itself up with philosophical catchphrases andthe thoughts of other men instead of saying, \\"This is what I believe. This is my worldview. This is what I really am.\\"<br /><br />I feel that I am not on target with this -- not completely -- but suffice to say, the theme was too heavy. It needed to relax. Themes are like a fine perfume. Too little, and the story is cheapened; too much, and even the least asthmatic gags and chokes.<br /><br />For example, at first, the \\"Black Freighter\\" subplot is a marvelous diversion and really spices up the story. It added yet another delicious layer to Watchmen, which I relished. However, after a while, I began to hate the \\"Black Freighter\\" chapters. Why? Because I got it. I got it after reading the first installment. Why did I have to keep reading about it? It only rehashed the same idea, and after a while seemed only to be included for the sake of shock value. I wasn't interested in this half-baked story with its over-the-top message and its one-sided character; I wanted to read about Rorschach and company.<br /><br />Another con is the darkness of this story. Yes, there is darkness in this world; that's understandable. But to deny that there is brightness in this world is foolish, too. It's sad to me that the only bright and cheerful character in this story is painted as blind and rather stupid (honestly, who would think that Rorschach saw \\"a pretty flower\\" in his ink-blot tests?). There are also few uplifting moments.<br /><br />The plot itself has been seen a thousand times before, and if it was not for its shining cast, it would not be remembered. To add insult to injury, it ends in a most ignominious fashion.<br /><br />(Spoiler Alert)<br /><br />A giant mutant squid explodes on New York.<br />Really.<br />A giant mutant squid with a psychic's brain explodes on New York, sending out horrifying brain waves that make people go insane. That is an acceptable ending for this otherwise excellent tour de force?<br /><br />The problem is thus: this book builds itself up as a completely sensible world directly correlating to our own, with characters that are completely realistic. The masked vigilantes are billed as real people, just physically fit and trained people, with no supernatural powers to speak of. The technological advances of this world seem sensible, what with Dr. Manhattan. Dr. Manhattan is the only quirk in this sensible, logical world, but we can accept him; we can stretch our belief enough to contain him. That's because he's the only aberration on Earth, and most people react sensibly upon seeing him -- they can't understand or accept him. We don't understand his rebirth, but it's possible not even he understands it. He's a hiccup in the laws of physics; that's okay. I can take a hiccup.<br /><br />But an otherwise normal man catching a bullet in his hand and a mutant squid being teleported to New York only to explode on impact and shoot psychic brain waves at people?<br /><br />To imply that a man can catch a bullet and that there are psychics implies that there are above-average human beings along the lines of Dr. Manhattan, and made me wonder if I had missed something in the first chapters of Watchmen -- were these costumed vigilantes actually, really superheroes? No, they aren't. Which only goes to show that this ending was no more than a deus ex machina, and a comical one at that.<br /><br />Even more comical is the fact that someone who is supposedly the most intelligent person alive thought it was the obvious choice to solving the world's current problem, and the supposedly brilliant Dr. Manhattan accepts it with a wry smile. Now, that is a stupid and unsatisfying ending! This issue only ties in with the problem of Watchmen's overbearing theme: is there substance underneath the armchair philosophy? Would anyone in their right mind think that exploding one mutant squid is going to make everything better? Even if you did get to pursue this plan of making the people of Earth think that an alien attack was imminent, how would you keep it up? Who would continue your little plot after you died? Would anyone that intelligent, with that kind of knowledge of history, really believe that such idiotic activity could lead to everlasting peace?<br /><br />Here's the problem: humans are transient and selfish by nature, and they never learn from history. History will tell this to you over and over again until it gets hoarse. There will never be everlasting peace as long as there's something to squabble over. Nor is there ever an easy answer to anything. Thus, when Watchmen finally ends, all neatly tied up in a bow, it's silly. It does not feel like the world has been saved or even that world politics have reached another plateau; it feels like the world is seconds from destruction -- either from nukes or an overzealous \\"protector.\\"<br /><br />Please don't get me wrong. Although I harshly criticize some of Watchmen's elements, I would recommend this graphic novel. It's an intelligent and fun read. The characters are sharp and realistic and make the read worthwhile. The story fumbles in the end, but it's riveting otherwise. Read it, and make up your own mind about it.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|I won't go into a lot of details about the film itself since everyone has covered that. The blu-ray version is definitely worth a buy, because The Dark Knight is pretty \\"dark\\" in a lot of places, and you really get clarity in HD.  Personally I thought Batman Begins was as better film with much more variety. This one is a little tedious with constant back and forth between Batman and the Joker, though Heath Ledger does come through with everything that's been said. The only thing wrong with these films is that the girlfriend is too ugly.

Disney later admitted that he undertook his version before reading Alice, and discovered that he didn't like the main character!<br /><br />It shows.<br /><br />Disney's Alice is not the critical observer Carroll created at all. She is indistinguishable from all of that era's Disney heroines - helplessly feminine and mindless, but sweet. Thank goodness everyone has moved on.<br /><br />Unfortunately this is a film that (like Wuthering Heights) had yet to be made. But maybe that's not so bad. Alice is all about narrative, nonsense, and a subtle humor that makes the book suitable for reading at any age.<br /><br />Read the book.

B001HT0LOS|3.0|This new St. Trinian's is not all bad, but as the title of this review says, I'm not sure it's worth spending the money to buy it.  I did, because I don't rent movies anymore and I have all the other St. Trinian's movies (the original 1950's ones -  Belles, Pure Hell, Blue Murder & Great Train Robbery) and this one does try to follow in the same vein as the originals - unfortunately, whilst sexual innuendo and nudity was shocking in the 50's, its pretty much par for the course now, so it doesn't really work.   Also, as much as I adore Rupert Everett, he just doesn't have it. He plays the dual roles of Miss Fritton, Headmistress of St. Trinian's girls school and her brother, a notorious art dealer.  The school is in financial ruin and so the girls hatch a plan to steal a valuable piece of art and sell it to Mr Fritton, using a school quiz show as a cover.  Rupert is in fine form and his understated portrayal of Miss Fritton is good, but he just doesn't come off as feminine as Alastair Sim did in the original.  However, this is more than made up for by Colin Firth, who shows his comedic talent is more than equal to his romantic, playing the Education Minister out to shut the school down (and former lover of Miss Fritton). He has some great moments and, if you like British actors, do keep your eye out for Stephen Fry, who is great as the slightly drunken quizmaster of the school quiz.  I'll be honest with you - I laughed at this movie in places (mostly at Colin Firth and Stephen Fry) but for most of it I just sat and watched. Then I watched the deleted scenes and thought how much more sense the movie would have made if they hadn't cut them out.  If you want to while away a few hours watching 16 year old girls in tight skirts and/or goth makeup and 14 year old girls making alcohol in the school chemistry lab, then rent this movie. You'll have a pleasant time and you won't be bored.  But please don't buy it - not even for Colin Firth and Stephen Fry.

While I do understand the whole HDDVD vs Blu-ray war was a tough pill for many studios to swallow, once the dust settled and Blu-ray was it going forward, I still do not get why they did not get this out on Blu-ray in time for the holidays at the end of 2008???  Obviously the diehard Bourne fans and action addicts will come out in droves to pick this up, but I am really disappointed from a consumer standpoint that it was hard for them to see why getting this out there was a priority.    The 4 stars is only for frustration with a mega-company taking too long to put out something the fans and the consumers alike love.  Great movies, clean transfer to Blu-ray and enough extras to keep us interested in Bourne for years to come.
B001NOMNZW|5.0|When I first saw HSM 2, I was hooked.  As a dad with a three year old son and twin girls, they all love the musical performance it brings.  I used to have a season pass for the entire family to Disneyland for the past three years and within the California Theme Park, they did have a parade for the HSM 2.  My son loved it so much which we decided to get the Blu Ray version of the part 2.  Fast forward two years later, HSM3 did not dissapoint at all.  In fact, it raises the bar.  It has more musical performance and the message of being a senior in high school does send a very good message and it brings back memories.  It is a definite buy for me and it is worth every penny.  I just ordered thru Amazon the Blu Ray edition of the first HSM Remix in which I have not seen at all.  With this, my collection of all HSM movies will be complete.

I would buy these DVD's if you love English history and have an appreciation for a good drama.  I commend Showtime for creating a series about all of Henry VIII's wives.  While his relationship with Katherine of Aragon and Anne Bolyne are intriguing, Henry's remaining wives rarely get the attention they deserve.  Needless to say the Reformation during Henry's reign had profound ramifications on what would later take place during the reign of his daughter Elizabeth.  England's adherence to the Protestant cause under Elizabeth would lead to the attempted invasion by Phillip II the King of Spain and the Spanish Armada.      The portrayals of Sir Thomas More and Bishop John Fisher were brilliantly done, while Peter O'Toole is at his usual best as the Pope.  I wasn't sold on Natalie Dormer in the first Season as Queen Anne, but she grew into the role in the second season.  Kudos for cutting out some of the numerous sex scenes that were in the first season.  They really didn't add anything.  For those interested in this period, I would suggest watching some other films:    A Man for All Seasons, which is about Sir Thomas More  Elizabeth starring Cate Blanchett  Elizabeth the Golden Age also starring Cate Blanchett

B000UJ48O0|5.0|I rented the first disc of season one and liked it, so i decided to buy the whole series. Being a late comer there's bound to be alot of spoilers floating around. I accidentally read what happens to Marissa at the end of season 3 and that kind of ruined the whole series for me....But oh well, I might as well watch it because it's still a great show. Just knowing what happens at the end of season 3 sucks because I'm only on season one atm and i have to watch 3 seasons and i already know the outcome...omg...dam spoilers lol<br /><br />anyway the box set the disc came in is cool, and season one is remastered in 16:9 (1.78:1) format. great show
B001DHXT2A|5.0|Incredible Hulk (2008) is a great Movie!  I like the storyline and the action scenes in the movie. Edward Norton is really good as Dr. Bruce Banner. I also like Liv Tyler as Dr. Elizabeth Ross! There is cameo by the TV series Hulk, actor Lou Ferrigno in the film. The story was really great and the movie is better than the Hulk (2003)movie.  I highly recommend this film to all Incredible Hulk fans. A+

B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson plays Bryan Mills, a father who for years neglected his family in lieu of his job as a government agent. His daughter Kim is 18 and Mills is now feeling remorse over those lost years but has to contend with his daughter's stepfather, who is trying to assume the role of father. Mills reluctantly agrees (after pressure from his ex-wife) for his daughter to go to Paris with a friend, but shortly after she arrives, he receives a call from her telling him her friend has been kidnapped. Mills next words are chilling: \\"You will be taken.\\" He instructs his daughter to put the phone on the floor and describe her assailants. When one of the kidnappers picks up the phone, Mills offers him the chance to return his daughter or die. And from that point on, the movie is constant action. Neeson reminded me of an older Jason Bourne, a man determined to do what needs to be done. He will stop at nothing in his efforts to find and rescue his daughter, and lets no one get in his way.<br /><br />An exhilirating movie with great acting and action. Neeson's my new hero.

0307387178|4.0|This book is based on the true story of Christopher McCandless' last two years of life, but also serves as a vehicle for the author's compulsion, a searching exploration of the motivations behind the actions of McCandless.  McCandless was an intriguing young man who touched many lives, many of which he had only brief intersections with, but who no one could quite understand.  Certainly, none could claim any permanency in McCandless' life.  There has been much written about McCandless and his 2-year quest on foot to live primarily in solitude, culminating with a walk into his greatest period of solitude which he finds in the wilderness of Alaska and from which he ultimately fails to emerge.  Of course from McCandless' death arose a broad curiosity with who this young man was.  But as you read this book, you come to realize that this book is the author's personal indulgence memorialized.  Through his own engrossment with McCandless' path before his untimely death --a path which resonates and resounds compulsively with the author, the reader is led through the author's detailed interpretive presentation of McCandless' last two years of life.  And it is our good fortune that the author found himself fixed upon McCandless' life, for his well-examined presentation, although biased in his portrayals/ proposals of McCandless' motivations and purposes, are nonetheless spellbinding and arresting.<br /><br />Into the Wild offers possible answers to the many questions that swirl around McCandless' life and death; however, the reader is left unsatisfied, through no fault of the author, as McCandless left too few clues for those he left behind to understand his decisions and actions.  Yet, as the author takes us along his own quest to understand, we find ourselves grateful for the questions McCandless leaves us.  For it is with these questions that we, like the author, become aware of our own questions about ourselves and how we live our lives, about human nature, and about the fine balance between man's need for solitude and companionship, between selfish and selfless endeavors.nce between man's need for solitude and companionship, between selfish and selfless endeavors.

0316010669|4.0|The 1000th something review, so I'll keep it short.<br /><br />Blink is Malcolm Gladwells second book (after tipping point) and in it he looks at making decisions \\"in the blink of the moment.\\" Are these decisions better or worst than carefully analyzed decisions.<br /><br />The first part examines why they are actually better. It looks at the unconscious part of the brain and how we can use that to make quick decisions that are often better than decisions that are well analyzed. However, on the second part, he looks at the mistakes we humans make when making quick decisions. It gives advise how to train your unconscious brain and how to use it effectively for making quick decisions.<br /><br />Unlike most other reviewers, I enjoyed blink more than \\"the tipping point.\\" I felt the structure to be more coherent. As his previous work, most of the book are stories trying to make or break a certain point. Malcolms writing is excellent, but that ought to be expected from a journalist of such caliber.<br /><br />All in all, blink is worth reading. It is still written for a general audience and often didn't go into the depth I would have liked in books. Still, a good book and excellent writing.

B001AQT0UY|4.0|Don't expose them to sunlight. Don't let them get wet. And under no circumstances feed them after midnight.<br /><br />Those are the rules for the now-legendary mogwai, adorable little fuzzballs who transform if you break the last rule. And \\"Gremlins\\" is a gloriously unconventional Christmas movie -- a postcard-pretty view of suburban middle-America, splattered with gore, nasty little gremlins and a truly wicked sense of humour (expressed often in movie send-ups).<br /><br />Randall (Hoyt Axton) spots a tiny adorable creature -- a mogwai -- in a small Chinatown shop, and wants to buy it as a Christmas present for his son. The owner refuses, but his grandson secretly sells it to Randall.<br /><br />Randall's son Billy (Zach Galligan) is delighted by the fuzzy lightphobic mogwai, whom he names Gizmo. But it soon becomes clear that Gizmo is full of surprises: when water is accidentally splashed on him, he spontaneously generates a litter of NEW mogwai. The ringleader \\"Stripe\\" tricks Billy into feeding them after midnight, transforming them into scaly, dangerous \\"gremlins.<br /><br />And after a gremlin tumbles into a pool, Billy realizes that the town is about to be swarmed with them -- attacking vicious old Mrs. Deagle, ramming snowplows, murdering kindly teachers, and trashing a tavern with Billy's love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates). As the town descends into gremlinized chaos, the two humans (and Gizmo) must find a way to wipe out the horde... and if they miss only one, it'll start all over again.<br /><br />Personally I find most Christmas movies a little too sappy and sentimental. So for people who feel that way, a Yuletide horror/comedy is simply ideal -- it's sort of a mad hybrid of early Peter Jackson splattergore, Frank Capra snow-sprinkled Christmastime, and a bunch of sly movie homages and send-ups (\\"Forbidden Planet,\\" \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Snow White\\" amongst others).<br /><br />But the real fun is in watching the movie's balance between nasty and cuddly -- Joe Dante happily veers between sweet moments and grotesquely funny violence (such as Billy's mom messily killing gremlins with a variety of kitchen implements), with the best example being the malevolent Mrs. Deagle being flung out an upstairs window by fa-la-la-la-LAing gremlins. Completely sick, and gutsplittingly funn.<br /><br />And Dante sprinkles it with more G-rated comedy that borders on cartoonish without quite crossing, such as the kid in the Christmas tree costume (\\"Don't ask!\\") and the gremlins destroying a local pub when they aren't watching Disney movies (is this a message about Disney?). It all climaxes in some literally explosive showdowns with the gremlins -- and particularly with Stripe, their ghastly little leader.<br /><br />Galligan and Cates are thoroughly solid as the teenage heroes, especially when Cates gives her heartbreaking speech about the horrible experience that made her hate Christmas. In fact, all the actors do a solid job -- the evil old landlady who serves as a sort of Wicked Witch of the West/Scrooge hybrid, the cranky old veteran, the crackpot inventor and the wise old Chinese guy.<br /><br />But the showstopper is Gizmo -- tiny, round, fuzzy and wide-eyed, with a babyish squeaky voice and a liking for toy cars and 3-D glasses. Rarely has a puppet been so bloody cute and endearing. His complete opposite is Stripe, a gremlin amongst gremlins -- malevolent and gleefully sadistic, he seems smart enough to revel in the idea of destroying the town.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" is a brilliant horror/comedy that infuses a perfect American town with a little mayhem and gore, as well as some wickedly funny little nasties.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Vampires have always been creatures with romantic and tragic sensibilities. They want blood, but all along, they merely want love. Meeting these two goals complicate things in any states of normalcy. That is why when one wants to explore subjects of mortality, and doomed love affairs, vampires are perfect metaphors to use. The Swedish treat \\"Let The Right One In\\" gets this perfectly right, and this is the film what the innocuous and limpid \\"Twilight\\" series wants to be: perfect blend of doomed yet achingly sweet and tender romance, and skin-crawling horror, topped off with believable - and regardless whether or not they're sporting sharp teeth - three-dimensional characters. The film works on many levels: as a coming out tale, a coming of age one, a horror dramady, an artful and thoughtful independent work that Ingmar Bergman would have been proud of. Regardless, it is romantic, scary and ruminative, bringing fresh blood into the veins of a dying genre.

1577314808|5.0|What would our world be like if instead of compulsive thinking, we could all become compulsively \\"present\\" to ourselves and to each other?  \\"Being,\\" says Tolle, is the ever present One Life. Being present in the \\"Now\\" helps us untangle from compulsive thought so that there is more space for wisdom and grace.  This is the Power of Now.  Tolle's discussion explores the dynamics of this process from many different angles.  I enjoyed the wisdom of this book.<br /><br />(I wrote the above review in 2009.  It is now 2014.  I'm editing my review to report the ongoing influence of this book.  I find myself picking it up again and again over the years.

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Christopher Nolan's idea of a good time is quite different from the rest of us. This is a very serious treatment of a super hero, and rightly so, because Batman is arguably the most complicated comic book character, even more so on philosophical and psychological basis. In Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\", the Joker smiles a lot, but is even more deranged and sadistic than even before. Heath Ledger's brilliant performance is utterly phenomenal but very troubling, which is even more of an indication of Nolan's commitment to regard this film as a character study, and an exploration of ethical and moral issues, and not merely a superhero movie. He succeeds on many fronts, bringing complexities and intricacy not just to the hero and the man behind that hero, but to the villains themselves. This is great achievement, as the film transcends comic book sensibilities and becomes something else: a film noir, a character study, a high brow and intellectual entertainment. One might call the film as too nihilistic, sadistic and bleak. Arguably, that's how the Gotham City should be, where even its heroes are ambiguous and flawed at best: tragic, terrifying, and hopeless.
B000071K5L|5.0|The story is about racial injustice and the loss of innocence. We see Atticus defending the black man, Tom Robinson, against a white family who says he raped their daughter. Atticus is called many names because he is willing to defend a black man and without pay. Bob Ewell, the father of the \\"raped\\" girl is determined to get revenge on the Finch family and anyone involved in the trial. Atticus believes that since the trial is over and Tom is 70 miles away that Bob Ewell will be done with the whole thing and put it behind him. Aunt Alexandra who helps take care of Atticus, Scout and Jem thinks that a man like Bob will do anything to get revenge. Throughout the book, a sense of foreboding is felt due to wondering whether the Finch family are safe from Bob. Another character we hear alot about is Boo Radley. He is a man who sits in his house and never comes out. Scout and Jem wonder why he doesn't come out and everyone else tell them it is because he is weird and crazy. They are all scared of him. Every summer a friend of Scout and Jem's named Dill returns to their town and they try to make Boo Radley come out of his house. Scout says all she wants is to see what he looks like. One year the town has a Halloween party and Scout and Jem are going home afterwards. it is dark and they cannot see very well. All of a sudden they hear a noise from behind and they are scared. Someone tries to grab them and there is a scuffle. Jem is hurt in the scuffle and the man who attacked them turns out to be Bob Ewell. Boo Radley had seen the whole thing and comes to help. He kills Bob Ewell with a knife but in the process but no one sees him do it. Boo carries Jem to the Finch house so he can get help. Scout sees him later in her house and realizes who he is. She realizes that looks can be deceiving and often people are not as they seem. She learns many life lessons and doesn't really want to grow up but is forced to due to the circumstances in her life.     This is an awesome book andit definitely gets 5 stars out of 5. You should watch the movie as well because Gregory Peck portrays Atticus Finch and he is great.
0307269752|5.0|I didn't know a thing about this book before starting to read it, and then could not put it down. Not only thrilling, funny, touching, etc., but a view of modern Swedish life. Not for the squeamish, though!
0064407667|5.0|My 10 yr old daughter had no interest in this series until she read book 1 as a school reading group assignment. Afterwards she was hooked. She usually enjoys books such as \\"Judy Moody\\", \\"Charlotte's Web\\", Fairy of the Realm, Harry Potter, and anything by Roald Dahl.  Yes it's true this story is about orphans whose lives are full of misery and despair so probably too creepy for kids under 9. My daughter enjoyed the humor, the suspense, the kids' intelligence and self reliance. She said some parts were a little scary but overall were mostly just suspenseful.  She is now on book #4 since each book only takes about a weekend to finish. Adults who are interested should know the book is written for children in that almost every little thing is explained which could get monotonous.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|Though great cinema, one could argue that this is not the best film of the year. Danny Boyle's narration moves too fast to explore and further develop the characters. As a result, there is a bit of a superficial sheen that gleams that merely fixes the film as a lighthearted and breezy, though occasionally exhilarating, great novelty. Indeed, it is a crowd-pleaser, but the tragedies, daunting they may be, seem underplayed, so our rooting for the underdog seems a bit manufactured, and thus, undeserved, and his happy ending seems contrived. On the other hand, Boyle's overall unshaken optimism and idealistic fairy tale sensibilities take control of how this film is perceived: a glass half full. It is through his unwavering positive philosophy which propagates that everything is going to work out in the end that anchors this work by unpretentiously using the old-fashioned way of telling a story: to simply tell a story, and indeed reading it as a fairy tale book. So by virtue of doing this, \\"Slumdog Millionare\\" succeeds as a fairy tale, and it is a grandly entertaining one at that, with a highly positive and singing ending to boot. One should just ignore the unintended commercial sheen, and dance with this one.
0739326740|3.0|Having finally read \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" I can only express surprise at the anger, outrage, and scandal that seemed to result from its release and early popularity.  Sure, there was some harsh criticism of Catholicism in it, mostly from the past, and sometimes based on dubious historical fact (5 million women burned for witchcraft?  Please!)...but in the end, it actually seemed to pull most of its punches and let the Church off lightly.<br /><br />There's no doubt that as a page turning work of suspense, as a 'chase thriller,' it was fun.  Since most of it takes place over a single evening, night, and morning, the action is even further condensed and frenetic.  And the big plot-turn at the end, while suspected, was still startling enough to rivet the reader and demand an explanation.<br /><br />Yes, at times the book was a little far-fetched, never more so than at the beginning where a fatally-wounded character manages amazing gyrations in the process of leaving elaborate clues.  And for a book propping up its fiction with historical facts, the latter were sometimes questionable if not simply wrong.<br /><br />But these are quibbles with a work of entertainment and fiction.  Just read it, have fun, and if you have questions, go look up the facts somewhere more reliable and get the real story.  The single most amazing fact about the book is that anyone thought of it as a \\"threat\\" in the first place.
B001HN6972|4.0|Michael Berg (Kross) meets Hanna Schmitz (Winslet) in 1958.  She finds him near her apartment, coming down with Scarlet Fever.  She takes him home to recover, and when he does, he seeks her out to thank her.  They begin an affair, combining sex and him reading to her.  When she vanishes, Michael does not see her again until 1966, when she goes on trial for being a Nazi and killing 300 Jews at Auschwicz.    \\"The Reader\\" is an interesting film that could have been more effective if it was told a bit differently.  The non-linear aspect makes the film come across as choppy, and detracts from the overall effect.  Winslet and Kross are solid as the leads, bringing believability to both their characters.  Winslet is especially excellent, portraying Hanna as both good and evil as the story progresses.  Perhaps evil is not the right word though, as her motivations are a bit different than one might expect.  This does not make her more likeable, but it does give a glimpse into how many Germans dealt with the everything that happened during World War II.  This is an interesting film, but not for everyone.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This film has defined an entire generation of corporate-working, material junkies whose spiritual path got cluttered with Ikea tables, television infomercials, and ball-less Ray Romano-like portrayals of what men should act like. Paul Palanuik's novel is perfectly adopted into an innovative visual masterpiece by David Pincher (who was at the height of his career, just came off of his other masterpiece - Seven). Throw in the acting talents of Brad Pitt, Edward Norton (who was also at the height of his career at the time with films like Primal Fear, American History X, etc) and Helena Bonham Carter and you got yourself a classic.

IMHO, it's even better than Freakonomics, Logic of Life and the many pop wisdom top sellers (the Gladwell ones) in recent years for its high applicability in our daily life. In short, a must read.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|I have loathed every Metallica album released since the Black album.  I admittedly liked the \\"Black Album\\" but felt it was an overall turn for the worst from the same band that brought us masterpieces like \\"Master Of Puppets\\" and \\"...and Justice for All.\\"  I was proven right after the putrid \\"music\\" released from the 'Loads' to St. Anger (arguably the worst metal album ever recorded). I could have easily ignored \\"Death Magnetic\\" but thanks to my gullible nature, I picked it up.      All I have to say is I am glad I got it.  Mike Portnoy of Dream Theater described it as \\"the first real Metallica album in 20 years.\\"  I wholeheartedly agree.  It only loses a star with me for production issues.  I don't know who decided on the compression rate used for the final release, but that person miscalculated badly.  To remedy the problem, it is a good idea to adjust your levels for less midrange and more bass to even it out. If you have a good sound system, you will quickly know what I am talking about.  If you have a less desirable system...it may not matter.       Death Magnetic sounds like the same band that Metallica once was with an update in sound.  Sure, there are hints of the more recent releases from the band, but they have pulled off a helluva ride!  Good job, guys.  Can you do it again???  We shall see.
B001G9FFIQ|5.0|I bought this opus while stationed in the UK and when the brother put this platter to the needle I was glued and I played it over and over. Back then Cd's were just really beginning it's introduction so I recorded it on my cassette and wore the bitch out. I love Funk,Hip Hop R&B but always had a sweet spot for metal.. Believe it or not America !!!! Brothers have dug rock and metal for many of years thanks to Ernie Isley and his molten blistering solo guitar wizardry. Hell a brother introduced me to Motley Crue when Shout was released. And I introduced one of ny white metal head friends who loved Hip Hop to Trouble who to me at that time were the shizzle.Great music transcends alot of crap.But back to And Justice, I love albums that speak to real issues and this one does it time 1,000,000.... In my opinion this is there best followed very closely by Master and Ride. Kirk does some his career best fret work on this joint. The solo on Shortest Straw is absolutely dope.. I definitely believe that this is rage before RATM. And dammit I wish RATM would release something soooooooon.Tom Morello is that dude. Peace
0575081406|5.0|The Main character acts in a very believable way. Yes the character has bad things happen (As per the back cover) but it isn't because he is ignorant or acts stupidly to further the plot. He does things you can understand and for reasons you can understand. That is what makes this book good in my opinion. It is a realistic character in a well thought out world. I am a major nitpicker and usually rip every movie or book apart for all of its flaws, especially unrealistic characters or behavior (my degree is in psych). If there were any flaws in this book I was entertained enough that I missed them. This book ate up a lot of my weekend to read, now I just wish the sequel were in my hand so I could further abuse my eye muscles.

B001M6KTLG|1.0|I love the original Indiana Jones movies even though they go against the grain of my profession. As an archaeologist I cringe every time I see Indy or someone else in the movie destroy an artifact or remove an artifact without recording its context. Indiana Jones is nothing more than a grave robber purporting to be an archaeologist. With that being understood, every archaeologist I know denounces Indy's practices but secretly wants to be as cool as he and with a certain amount of suspension of belief, or disbelief, really enjoys the original Indy movies. With that being said, the \\"fourth\\" installment is truly horrible. The special effects were terrible, the story line was so implausible that even people outside the realm of reality, not to mention archaeology, were wondering what the writers were on when they penned this, and the whole premise of the movie was nothing more than a bridge between the originals and a new series with a new Indy. This movie basically killed all that was good in Indiana Jones forever.
B00004SVIK|5.0|Just as this review's title says, this is WAY better than the original. As a long time fan of Pink Floyd, I eagerly awaited the original release of \\"The Wall\\" in 1979, knowing it had been in progress since 1978, with the seeds being planted as far back as 1977. But when it came out, I was strangely disappointed; I just didn't like it that much. Sure, it has its moments, but there was missing something. I was aware of the problems between Roger Waters and the rest of the band, particularly with Rick Wright, and if one is more than a casual listener, it becomes apparent that this is Waters' trip. David Gilmour said the demos were \\"excruciating\\" to listen to, but the ideas were there, and they overflowed into \\"The Pros And Cons Of Hitchiking,\\" as well as \\"The Final Cut,\\" which I feel is actually a better record than \\"The Wall.\\"<br /><br />The movie, a friend told me, as he saw it before I did, said it was \\"a piece of crap,\\" but I know some Floyd product can be labored enjoyment, even to a die-hard fan as myself. So I watched the movie in the theater, and later someone gave it to me on VHS, as a gift, but I kind of agreed with Ralph, I didn't like it all that much, save for the animated sequences, which I feel are among the best I have ever seen. But it is a bleak, disjointed, sprawling, two-hour music video, which is an indictment of all the people who ruined the main character's life. Bob Geldof did a fine acting job as Floyd Pinkerton, the person who took on the name \\"Pink Floyd,\\"  or \\"Pinky,\\" as his friends called him in the script, but I just don't like the movie very much. It is well made, but I just can't get into it.<br /><br />Many years later, when the live shows from 1980 and 1981 were culled into this disc, I gave it a shot, as I had some money to throw away, and was pleasantly surprised to listen to this recording. I have never really rated Roger Waters as a vocalist, but he sounds pretty good here. The band is tight, despite having four auxiliary musicians and four backup vocalists to pad the sound out, and the ambience I feel is missing from the original recording is here in these live versions of this material. The presentation is somewhat sterile, as a show of this magnitude has very little wiggle-room, but given what the musicians and road crew had to work with, everyone involved did a remarkable job, well worth the wait, even though it would have been nice not to have waited so long. But releasing \\"The Wall\\" twice in quick succession might not have been a very good idea, people would've said they were only cashing in on a popular record. This was wise, waiting to put this out, as it all is in perspective now; Waters took the wheel and pushed the band foreward, while Gilmour tried to keep it on course. Wright and Nick Mason seemed to be lesser elements, but all the input from four men made Pink Floyd what it was, albeit in varying degrees.<br /><br />Despite all the infighting, this was a band which did something truly special in modern music, and this release only further cements my opinion.p vocalists to pad the sound out, and the ambience I feel is missing from the original recording is here in these live versions of this material.

B0000C9ZBW|4.0|this is my second skagen watch, am really pleased with it. i lost a pin from the band 3 days after receiving this, and skagen replaced it promptly. great watch, great service. 5 stars (i clicked on 4, meant 5)..<br /><br />EDIT: as nice as the watch is, the band is HORRIBLE. the watch has fallen off my wrist 3 times over the last month. last night, on the subway. soon, will probably lose it (or it will get damaged).<br /><br />would change my review to 1 star if i could change that. again, great watch, horrible watchband.

074322454X|4.0|I became a fan simply because of the HBO series.  After watching it a couple times I decided to read the book.<br /><br />This book reads like stories told by the men who fought.  I was intrigued the whole time though I did see some discrepancies between the series and the books.  Minor ones mind you.  Such as the attack on Foy when Dike hunkered down behind the haystack.  In the series, Winters goes to run out and is called back and lectured he can't do that.  In the book Winters did start to run out but changed his mind.<br /><br />There have been many opinions on Sobel.  Some have argued he was unjustly targeted, character assassinated, etc.  However, a few comments has stated he built the men.  Even Wild Bill commented what he did prepared them.  I do suspect however, he was not up to commanding men in battle.  He may simply have been really good at getting men ready for battle.<br /><br />I did like the stories of the men.  I did get a feeling for personalities.  They were not all \\"John Wayne\\" type heros.  They were men in war.  Though I must admit I felt the admiration of the author come through the pages.<br /><br />One thing I did find myself wondering was the accuracy of the information.  I freely admit I am hardly the expert to judge.  My wondering became more apparent after reading elsewhere that Albert Blythe survived his injuries and went on to have a good career in the paratroops.  Over 600 jumps.  I read that there were attempts to get this error corrected with showing evidence as to the fact.  It was a poignant story and I wonder if there is an effort to keep the story intact rather then tell the history of the man.  Mistakes happen.  Especially when the history is oral.  However, is not the historian supposed to search for the facts and raise conflicts with the story tellers?  I hope in a future printing they make a an addition to explain it was though he died of his wounds.<br /><br />One thing that is apparent is the lack of references.  I am not sure how to measure the intent.  Would it take away from the stories and turn it into a history book talking about places, regiments, and maps, etc.  Would it have helped?  Possibly the serious history readers.  Sometimes I wonder if the book was aimed at the casual reader.<br /><br />Overall, I like the book for what it was.  People can argue the merits or lack there was of Ambrose.  The one aspect this book and the miniseries did was to get me to want to read more books about the 101st.he intent.

B000002MIB|4.0|Probably all live albums get fixed later in the mix. Maybe this one has it share of fixes but it sound great. The drum solo could have been either edited or worked on more - sound-wise, and the bass solo is a bit boring and so is the guitar solo. Eddie plays great, but he ends up playing the same, predictable guitar solo as he has been doing so for the last 20 years... The singing is GREAT. The songs are great. Sammy's versions of Jump and Panama are as good if not better than the originals.    If you like VH then go out and get this record AND the DVD too...
B001GXTXTO|5.0|I heard one song on this album and I just had to buy it.  And for an impulse buy, I was not even remotely disappointed.  This is what blues really sounds like, no slick production, just raw guitar and great vocals.  So many blues singers have unique, but distinctly flawed voices that can really take some time to get used to.  The album works because the vocals are credible - the guy was born to sing this style of music.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E packs a lot of action and emotion into an all too brief 98 minutes of cinematic \\"pow.\\" Wall-E is a tour de force for Pixar which pulls this off without a hitch. The excellent animation and the live action combine to showcase good taste and creativity. Director and co-writer Andrew Stanton worked very hard on this film; and much credit goes to the numerous animation staffers and the rest of the crew as well.<br /><br />When the film starts, we quickly meet Wall-E (voiced by Ben Burtt), a robot designed to clean up the incredible global junkyard left behind by humans who refused to care about the environment. People now live in space aboard spaceships including the Axiom, which was designed by the huge corporation Buy N Large. Wall-E roams the remnants of an evacuated city; and he collects some of the stuff he finds as he packs away the garbage into tidy little bundles so that maybe someday humans can return to Earth. Wall-E's only companion is his pet roach who subsists on a Twinkie-like cake's creamy filling. Wall-E's only real entertainment comes from watching a VHS tape of Hello, Dolly! every night after work.<br /><br />One day a huge spaceship lands on Earth where Wall-E is working; and out of it comes Eve (voiced by Elissa Knight). Eve, predictably, is a female robot whose name is an acronym for \\"Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator.\\" Almost instantly, Wall-E is smitten; he is lonely and he finds Eve attractive as well. Unfortunately, Eve's mission must remain \\"classified\\" and although she can't say much she sure is strong and threatening at times! After Wall-E gives Eve a plant, Eve becomes unresponsive and she returns to the spaceship. In order to be with her Wall-E bravely scales the spaceship from the outside and he hangs on for dear life as the ship shoots up into space.<br /><br />The spaceship with Eve, the plant and other similar probing robots heads for the Axiom. Once at the Axiom, Eve is evaluated and Wall-E is not exactly welcomed with open arms. The captain of the ship (voiced by Jeff Garlin), who does very little because it's all on autopilot, eventually lets Wall-E get cleaned up after his trip but the plot doesn't stop there. We meet many humans who are now living on board a ship that has cruised through space for 700 years even though the original Earth cleanup mission was only to last five years. People just don't care; they became almost vegetable-like as they recline in chairs and talk to each other through computer like monitors. They certainly aren't getting any physical exercise!<br /><br />It isn't long, either, before there are more complications and confrontations. There are some \\"bad\\" robots including Auto (voice courtesy of MacInTalk), the autopilot machine. Auto wants to stay in space but the captain thinks they should return--after all, the plant Eve got from Wall-E proves that life is possible again on Earth. At this point there are many references to the relationship between HAL and a human being as depicted in the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />It may well seem that I've given too much away, but I left things out even up to this point. And what happens next could surprise you. Will Auto or The Captain win the power struggle about returning to Earth to make it once again inhabitable? What about Wall-E and Eve--will Eve finally return Wall-E's love for her? What about the humans onboard the ship? Will they stay practically riveted to their chairs to merely exist or will they want a real life on planet Earth? Watch the movie and find out!<br /><br />The extras are all very good; but I particularly enjoyed Presto and Burn-E. Of course, if you get the three DVD package of this film you'll get a lot more bonus features.<br /><br />Wall-E will forever be a classic Pixar animated film; the importance of taking good care of Mother Earth is also timeless. The plot deals with the universal themes of love and hate, and it pits good against evil. The level of the violence is not too high; therefore I highly recommend this film for people of all ages.this film for people of all ages.
B000FC21PA|3.0|This review is for the Kindle edition and not the book in general which stands on it's own merits and needs no review from me.  The Kindle edition I read was full of typographic errors which detracts from the flow of the narrative.  While most of the errors are small ones such as dropped letters or misspellings, they are extremely numerous.  I would estimate there is at least one per page.  Until a better Kindle version is made I suggest buying the physical book.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I totally agree with many of the reviewers on the content of the movie vs the content of the book.  I concur with the view that Anne would not run around Bath without being properly attired, even though the character has no great feelings for \\"propriey\\" as it is found in her own family circle.  I decided to just enjoy the two as separate, without being fussy, other than one unexplained detail in the movie.  Kellynch is entailed; how, therefore can Wentworth present the property as a wedding present?

The mixes rock and it shows off the band for the prog gods they have become.<br /><br />For a band who couldn't care less about radio play, these guys have developed a fan base that most top 40 posers can only dream about. And they are incredible live.<br /><br /> Although this CD gives a great representation of the bands entire career, you really must check out ALL of their work in order to fully appreciate them. I don't know how they come up an album to top the last year after year. But I hope they never lose the ability.<br /><br />LONG LIVE DREAM THEATER!

B000002868|4.0|With as much anticipation as rock fans had several years before for Blind Faith, the jazz scene was highly anticipating the debut of the supergroup Weather Report.<br /><br />Joe Zawinul, Wayne Shorter and Miroslav Vitous formed the nucleus - with Alphonse Mouzon (d), Airto Moirera (per), Barbara Burton (per) and Don Alias (per) - for the May 1971 release. The eight selections were recorded over three days in March 1971.<br /><br />The trio created numerous soundscapes with nature/the outdoors as the theme - Morning Lake, Waterfall, Milky Way, Umbrellas - but the real gem is the Vitous penned Seventh Arrow; the 5:23 running length could have easily been doubled and the composition would not have come close to losing its textured brilliance.<br /><br />There is a hint at things to come (the band had not even performed live before entering the studio) and the accolades came rolling in later in the year; there were a trio of awards from Swing Journal and the Down Beat readers selected the release as Jazz Album of the Year.<br /><br />This truly was the beginning of a superb supergroup that was poised to define the fusion sound throughout this intriguing decade for jazz.

0743290119|3.0|I'm really glad that I didn't buy this book new because I would have tried to return it.  It wasn't absolutely awful, but it really wasn't particularly good.  I don't have much to echo in addition to what the other reviewers have said, but the main points that I noticed were:<br /><br />1)No continuity - characters appeared and then left, like the walking stereotype hairdresser who is in all kinds of scenes until about page 100 and then just drops off the face of the planet.<br /><br />2)Plot stuff just not adding up - these girls talk to each other all the time.  So how come one has to tell the other about a date that the third went on a week before?  You're telling me that in a week, these cell-phone addicts haven't spoken?  Also, weird things like the one girl is in Paris and the other girl is in New York, and it's supposed to be 2am in New York according to the dialogue, but the girl in Paris is sitting at the bar meeting men who are stopping for drinks before heading out to parties.  With a 6 hour time difference, you're telling me that guys at this hotel are hanging out before parties at 8am?  Maybe hanging out after parties, but I wouldn't think they'd be on their way.  So there was weird stuff like that just not adding up that I'd think an editor would catch?<br /><br />3) I didn't actually think the plot was that bad, and I rather liked the ending, but man, there were parts that just dragged on and on and on and on and on and on and on until eternity.  Then there's a big skip and you're like, \\"woah - am I supposed to know what's going on here?\\"<br /><br />So all in all, I would recommend buying this book used, like I did, or getting it at the library.  If you liked her other books, I'm sure you'll want to read this one, too, so if you have the time, go for it.  Just don't expect it to be as good as the others.

They tied it into what some people believe is the time when the Sphinx was built (10,000BC) and, some notion that the Sphinx and the complex around it was built by some God(s)...Two of which had died already. Needless to say, the hero killed the \\"God\\" and when the veil was removed, the \\"God\\" was an old grey-haired guy.  The CGI of the Saber Tooth Tiger was laughable... Although the giant man-eating Dodo birds were a bid amusing.  They conveniently ate a few of the \\"bad\\" guys.

B000LT2IHI|2.0|I bought this for my son for Christmas and although he loves pulling himself up with it, it is very unstable and will tip over with the weight of the baby. Not only that, but the head pops off!!! It is not latched on or connected to the base at all. I also can't stand that it only makes one sound. Save your money and buy the crawl and cruise musical jungle, best investment ever.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|I was watching HBO one day at home and came across this musical called Across the Universe. Loved the musical and the way the Beatle's songs were sung.<br /><br />Got on the net, started looking for the CD and found exactly what I wanted here at Amazon. I would have tried looking on Ebay but since they changed their search algorhythm...and nothing you are really looking for comes up....didn't even waste my time.<br /><br />Product arrived safely and securely packaged within one week from time of order. I call that a good deal and the price was excellent.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I thought this movie sounded really interesting.  It was so slow moving and boring that I fell asleep on it several times and really couldn't tell you how it ended.  I enjoy the English versions but this and the actors in it were one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Body of Lies is really a good film. For those who are looking for Hollywood-style action, you may very well be disappointed. For those who are looking for Hollywood-style thrills, then you'll be pleased with this one. While the gunplay is minimal, the suspense is colossal all around. It got a little too sophisticated when everything was tied together, but with a second viewing of the film I understood it. I enjoyed this film, though I didn't like the sub-plot with Aisha. Although it did add some interesting facts about the female society in an Islamic nation, it overall made the film a bit slower.<br /><br />But anyway, this is a great thriller made by Ridley Scott, who is one of the legendary directors of our time. Dicaprio, Crowe, and Strong give amazing, if not excellent, performances. The Middle Eastern music and elaborate cinematography give this film a nicer touch. I can easily recommend this to Scott fans, Crowe fans, DiCaprio fans, thriller fans, etc.<br /><br />Grade: A-
B000002LRX|5.0|All i can say is this album has changed my life. I remember listening to it when it first came out and it has not aged a day since then.    Best album EVER, everyone in the band is in their prime. I could go on for days describing how wonderful it is, but all i really need to say is just go buy it, and love it.
B000WCDI5K|4.0|I was very skeptical when I first purchased Sawdust. I wasn't exactly sure how good a collection of songs that didn't make the cut for their original albums could actually be. Thankfully, it only took a couple listens to realize that the CD was easily worth the money I paid for it. Many songs will have you immediately hooked from the second you hear them, such as Tranquilize, Move Away, The Ballad of Michael Valentine, Romeo And Juliet, and the new version of Sam's Town.    The only real album flaws are in one of it's 17 tracks, and that song is the Mr. Brightside remix. Personally, I've never been a fan of techno music, and this remix is just too electronic-sounding for me to enjoy. The 10+ minute running time isn't doing it any favors either. It doesn't ever come close to beating the original version.    Excluding another track or two that feel unremarkable compared to the rest of the album (like Ruby, Don't Take Your Love To Town and Shadowplay), I really did enjoy this album for what it was. It tells you something about a band when it's cut tracks are still better together than many full albums today. And so what if a couple tracks aren't that great? It's got 17 songs on it! You're bound to enjoy much more than you hate, and that gets Sawdust a 4/5 from me.    P.S. If you actually decide to listen to Mr. Brightside (Jacques LuCont's Thin White Duke Remix), wait until the last 50-some seconds of the song to hear a hidden, funny bonus song. It's short, but it's a cool little Easter Egg that's bound to put a smile on your face.
0757302661|1.0|I feel so guilty for having bought this book for my expecting daughter. She refused medication because of this books influence. She was exhausted after 74 hours of labor and had to be put on oxygen. This book has put a wall up between my son-inlaw and me. He saw his daughter born blue and has been devestated by it for not standing up against it. I was also told that this book refers alot to a class or training not really explaining issues.  The doctors know best, please listen to them  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!
0316017922|4.0|this book should be required reading for all college seniors, along with Freakanomics, Fooled by Randomness and The Black Swan (in order of increasing difficulty)
B00004CZVT|2.0|This version is so bad! Save your money and buy the Masterpiece one starring Helen Morse and Bryan Brown - my favorite movie and book can't count the times I've read it, watched it and loved it!!  These are people of substance and real romance not the trash they put out now!
B000002B30|3.0|I have an idea for this album in lieu of WalMart's. Keep the first eleven cuts as is and add Tunnel of Love and the following songs from the new century- The Rising, Radio Nowhere, Last to Die, Working on a Dream and Kingdom of Days. If you want to make it eighteen cuts as it is now you could add Prove It All Night early on. That leaves an eighteen song set that never lets up and does justice to his new music. Jon Landau are you out there?
B000002KO3|5.0|I love this release from the Talking Heads because with their rise to superstardom when MTV became hot.   This album is great to show the orginal four with various backing from Brian Eno, vocals, guitar and percussionist added fills the tracks nicely.  It showcases the bands mixture from previously released 1970's material.      I would suggest to get the CD \\"The name of this band is the Talking Heads\\".   CD 2 has many great live cuts from this album    James
B000002LRX|5.0|This cd is one of a few cd's i own out of 700+ in which I never get tired of hearing! There isn't a track on here that I dislike. My stand-out favorites are Jizzlobber, Smaller and Smaller, Caffine, and Mid-life Crisis.     The mood these songs create is unlike no other I have heard. It is terrible that this cd never got the props it truly deserves. This cd holds the distinction, in my collection, of being the closest to wearing out a cd, if that's even possible. Personally I wish anyone who likes music, or claims to be open-minded about all music, would give this cd a listen. Once you hear it you will want to hear it again and again! There are so many different musical styling's here that at some point everybody should be able to say \\"Hey, I like that!\\"     If you are reading reviews to help decide on giving this cd a listen then please do yourself a huge favor and check this out! You will NOT be disappointed.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The series is an extraordinary description of the life and times of John Adams. It is impeccably done in every aspect. I was breathtakingly lured back in time and in the process I learned so much. Bravo, to those fine actors, spectacular cinematography, distinctive music and the detailed historical accuracy that mastered such film perfection.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|arrived quickly, easy to order, far more inexpensive than ordering through any DVD clubs, that I currently belong to.... Can't have enough of LOST!
0452289963|5.0|This book isnt some cheesy self help book.  I was more turned off, than I was on, that it was part of Oprahs book club.  But after recieving a suggestion from a friend I read it.  All I have to say is this is the new turn of human evolution. This is where the human mind reaches vast new and amazing feats for the human race. This book absolutely blew my mind. So unbiased, so open minded, not tied down by the limitations of just one religion but the inclusion of all religions. This book really talks about breaking down the ego inside of you, which opens yourself and your mind to a whole new existence you never could have imagined. This book is hands down the best book I have ever read. It is so spot on with expanding the human consciousness and expanding the mind on this long journey of human evolution. A must read for those looking to see into the future of a better human race and the human mind. A must read no matter what religious background you are. And even if you're not religious he gives you valuable insight to the human mind and its predictabilities. Though ultimately tolle is a spiritual teacher the book is valuable to anyone even those who dont believe in the spiritual.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I can't think of any other word; at the end of this, I was at my wits end and sitting on the floor, shaking; it was like nothing I could recall at all.     Except for that one time I had been to Straford and seen Shakespeare performed one wonderful day in 1977; Macbeth; and I sat there and trembled and the world caught fire and my English teacher looked at me and he would have been pleased; I never saw anything the same way again, I swear.     The first hint that something remarkable might have been going on came, strangely, some four months before the series started to go on air. It was on the radio, a series, called, I think, Face to Face, and it kicked off with, of all people, Catherine Tate and David and it was very funny, but in all of this (and I parked in a layby to hear it properly) there was a very real hidden layer; these two had been close; there was a kind of quietness and fire and the feeling of tremendous latent energy between them that you only get after something very big has happened; and I knew then that something was most definitely up.     Billy piper then stated for the record, something very curious; you'll see the ending, she said, .. and you will cry. You will.     What on earth this was supposed to say to us all, at that time I could not fathom. It was the most cryptic and strange thing imaginable; and yet now, well, it makes sense because, in fact I did; and it was the most astonishing thing I have ever seen on television or anywhere else...     The first episode seemed lightweight until the ending minute; and my son (who was 21 then) sat back, open mouthed. WHAT?     He got up, ran to the kitchen, and ran back, paced up and down and then ran back to the kitchen. I was puzzled but it was growing on me, too.     We played it back. The same thing happened. This time we both went nuts. after a long time Simon said, in a slow voice \\"That's it. \\"They did it.\\"     \\"What?\\"     \\"THAT \\" he said, almost shaking from the effort, \\"THAT was the scariestthing I have ever seen. EVER!\\"     Oh yes; I should say so.     And done with a single look; one camera shot; and there you were.     \\"WHAT IS GOING ON?\\"... We just gawped.     The thing teased us through 13 weeks. four months in which I turned from being kind of intrigued into virtually a nervous wreck.     There were times when I wanted to turn up on his doorstep and personally give Bernard Cribbins an OBE; the man gives an absolutely stunning, amazing performance which perhaps is not performance at all, but the same man who gave us the Railway Children somehow simply presented as himself; then there was Midnight; a piece that was so chilling that I could not sleep that night; and then...     Well, after this, you would have gone barmy. The last (is it four?) episodes are so brilliant that I should have just given up and taken those weeks off. I was no good at anything.     The internet became a trap. It was strange; several rumours about the ending of the series multiplied across those weeks and by the time I had gotten halfway trough these last few stories, it had kind of converged to one quite credible theory that was actually very well fleshed out; my heart was just about in my boots. It was going to end in complete disaster, and that was going to be the end of it all. It was going to self destruct; and that was the awful portentious feeling that I had picked up on that quiet night, listening to the radio.     But it was not so.     In fact, this sequence of stories is a masterpiece; a single, unrepeatable, virtuoso act of writing, acting, editing, and composing that has the most wonderful ending you could ever imagine.     Last series saw the whole of New New York sing the Old Rugged Cross; here we had an utterly alien race delivered from slavery and degradation; who lift their hands up and give thanks and sing something that sounds like a hymn of praise; If you heard this at the Proms you will know why so many people found tears in their eyes at this; All Ithought about was those words \\"In my fathers house are many mansions\\", and how Heaven must contain so much more than we could possibly know about, and how great and majestic the fellowship of the saints must surely be with a galaxy this size; I had suspected this ever since I was young enough to understand that there was little contradiction between what I knew from Sunday school and the what I was learning from The Sky at Night; I was greatly moved by all of this and I still am.     And the end of the thing is preposterous and wonderful, and unbelievably moving and almost certainly has a kitchen sink or two for good measure. It's half Doctor Who, half Peter Pan and half Charles Wesley for all I know. Make sure that you are not too far from a fairly large sofa, folks. And you better get some tissues, because you may find that Billy Piper was quite right.
0684857219|5.0|I don't like to type much or ever give reviews for that matter, but this product is one of the few products that i have to write a review for because its so good. This book is like a scientist, who is a bodybuilder (with a pHd in \\"the human body) wrote it. This book is the Holy Bible of Bodybuilding.
0143113100|4.0|The content of this book was a delight.  Very well explained.  The author presents a credible and logical development of the story behind localization of function (a somewhat pessimistic and dominating paradigm in education and medicine that has limited our potential for growth and recovery now for decades) versus a solid and fascinating array of evidence for not-so-strict localization supplemented by very substantial plasticity.  While the latter is not new, the evidence supporting it has been harder to demonstrate and the hope it offers has unfortunately been deferred.<br /><br />Dr. Doidge's book is a beautiful presentation of the human story behind the scenes -- including that of the researchers who committed their lives to this work as well as of the patients who discovered hope and help through it. No particular science background is required, because he does a wonderful job of explaining just what's needed in lay language.  I had a hard time putting it aside even to sleep!!!<br /><br />_________________________________________________<br /><br />Comments specific to the Kindle Edition Only<br /><br />My major reservation and why the book receives 4 rather than 5 stars regards a dilemma with presenting it on Kindle media.  Interestingly Dr. Doidge starts to evaluate the role of technology and media in influencing our brain function -- given its ready plasticity.  He discussed TV, internet, video games, and the printing press, but unfortunately not Kindle versions of e-books, including his.<br /><br />Itt would be valuable to address what was gained and lost with the Kindle version.  Because Kindle is still a relatively new media -- now is the best time to exercise its own plasticity toward better wholeness.<br /><br />Positive sparks for the Kindle:  I indeed like the ability to receive the book within minutes of purchase. I like not needing to prop it open on the table in order to keep my place.  I like not being tempted to fold over a page edge when the book won't stay propped or needing to scramble for some scrap paper to tear up and insert.  It is a relief to be able to add notes which don't clutter up the margins with scribbled lines and highlights.<br /><br />However, some negative Kindling was ignited as well trying to make my way through this book -- particularly over the loss of context and critical visuo-spatial clues.  Reading is not a strictly linear activity.  There were key features of the global spatial organization that are sadly missing in the Kindle version.  Examples:<br /><br />1.  There are no clues as to what chapter you are reading once you have dived into one. So if you lay down your Kindle and resume latter...who knows?  Many non-fiction books would have a header or footer on every page as a reminder or you can rapidly flip a chunk of pages in a matter of milliseconds to find out.  Much more tedious to page backwards or forwards an unknown number of \\"location blocks\\" to find out.  (Instead of page numbers you are shown locations blocks.)  There are several potential solutions -- having a menu item that zooms out to context information like this, or implementing better use of the horizontal position bar at the bottom of the screen so that instead of showing you the percentage of the entire book you have passed through, the bar at least shows where you are with respect to major chapter divisions as a contextual map.<br /><br />2.  Finding natural rest breaks is nearly impossible.  I like to have an idea how far into a chapter I have progressed, and whether reading just a couple more pages will leave off at a \\"good stopping point\\" (i.e. after a good night's sleep).  Not possible.  The progress marker at the bottom of the text refers to what percent of >7000 locations you have completed -- which refers to the percentage of the whole book. The only thing less useful would be to tell me how many words or characters I've completed out of the whole.<br /><br />3.  Use of supplmentary material is very cumbersome.  After the first chapter or so, I like to know the scope of the remaining text, how much is really text versus supplements.  How good the supplements and illustrations are and how they would be used while reading the text.  Yes...I really do want to know what is actually in the appendices so I can see if I will use them as I am reading.  Again.  Not much to go on here.  In this book the appendices do contain several items but these are not cataloged in the table of contents -- its a total mystery box.  Once you start into Appendix 1 or Appendix 2 you can't tell what is coming up next or where you are within and between the internal sections.  You don't know whether you will miss something valuable or not without going through every single screen.  You can't perform a search for something you don't know yet is there.<br /><br />4.  The index likewise is not helpful other than to serve as a reminder of key phrases in the book.  These do not work as links back to the relevant part of the text.  No location or page numbers are shown.  No frequency of occurrences is given. Nothing to suggest any relative perspective about where in the book the information occurs.<br /><br />Instead you must type the phrases one at a time into the search box.  I do like some features of the the resulting list of occurrences for that word or phrase, the 2-4 line capture of the surrounding sentence(s) and the ability now to link back to the text.  However, most of the critical context is still lost.  There is no easy way to \\"zoom out\\" and see whether the clip you have been transported to is in chapter three, five or chapter nine.  You don't know if the topic covers a range of several pages and is a major occurrence or whether it is  single line/paragraph hit.  You can't tell whether it is before, after or anywhere near the passage where you remember reading about a favorite or related phenomenon.  Looking up the related phenomenon next might help; however, it is likewise floating adrift in a contextless sea.  I do realize that one can look at the location numbers.  But these are so ridiculously large and not subdivided into chapters -- they are relatively meaningless.  At least some memory functions work by chunking -- but these chunks need to have meaning!!<br /><br />5.  Similar constraints limit the usefulness of the notes section.  they are not easily associated with the text to which they refer, nor is it easy to find them chapter by chapter -- only as giant a \\"clump\\" at the end.<br /><br />It seems possible that an unfortunate side-effect of engaging in Kindle- reading, until these contextual and spatial clues are restored, would actually interfere with the forms of photographic memory unconsciously employed by most of us and especially by those who have a gift for photographic memory.  It becomes nearly impossible to stamp into memory 7000 locations devoid of almost all other landmarks and that change based on text size.  A truly functional and fascinating part of our brain function is potentially sacrificed.<br /><br />Thus, I think it would be useful to gather some master publishers of printed works along with Dr. Doidge and the best of these surviving neuroscientists/neuroengineers he interviewed and put them into a think tank project -- these creative minds and Amazon's Kindle developers need to invest a bit more thought into ways to maximize the Kindle interface with: a)this book, and b) the human brain.<br /><br />Surrendering so many visuospatial and organizational cues for contextless leaps between linear text clusters does not seem like a productive tradeoff to me.  Neuroscience professionals working out these dilemmas on his intriguing book could solve similar problems for many other books -- the nonfiction and academic books are most in need.  Navigating a novel with only a few trail markers may be fine.  But not so fine for the less narrative works; its an especially vulnerable way to travel for anything academic.<br /><br/>Over time publishers have acquired a great deal of information about the organization and contextual patterns which truly improve understanding, learning, recall and motivation to return to a book for reference purposes.  I really don't want to give up this acumulated wisdom.  So far computer assisted publishing has added substantial depth to the ordering and visual aspects of the printed page.  So...now with the Kindle...let's truly improve rather than just subtract contextual and multisensory clues.<br /><br />I'd rather not rewire my brain backwards toward chaos through my exposure to Kindle books.ers.

0399534601|5.0|This is an awesome book for anyone looking to expand their awareness of their surrounds. Beginning right where you are sitting and expanding to include the whys and hows of common everyday explorations. I bought this book for my son who will soon become a high school teacher. Learn to think beyond and outside the box.
B00122J30S|3.0|Billy is truly at his best in songs like \\"Pomp and Circumstances\\" the only song I purchased on the album. I wouldn't mind if he dropped the SP title and went back to producing another solo album.
0545128285|5.0|The book arrived in only 4 days and was in fabulous condition. I would recommend this seller to anyone.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is one of the best DVD workouts I've ever purchased.  It's challenging from day one, and I'm getting great results from it.  You should never get bored from this workout.  This is a must-have for your home gym.
B0009I7O7A|2.0|I actually liked only about 2 songs on this CD....<br />I gave it to someone that loves John Mayer and actually<br />likes the fact you cannot understand a single lyric he<br />is singing!!! LOL
B001MW0IY8|2.0|I came across I Am a Bird Now some years ago.  It was shockingly good.  One of the most distinctive voices I have ever heard.  What was especially surprising is the I found myself blown away by the perfect synthesis of music and vocals in light of some disturbing lyrics.  Certainly, the subject of those songs is unconventional to say the least.  Nonetheless, I anxiously waited for the next Antony release.  What a major disappointment.  Maybe I set the bar too high, but this CD does not belong anywhere in the same universe as the last one. First, the music is almost nonexistent.  The production is focused soley on Antony's voice. But, the focus also sounds experimental and incomplete.  Having given it a handful of listens start to finish, there is nothing memorable about it.  One Dove is a fairly good song and the only reason I did not give this disc one star.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|Excellent product...great to watch when you can't sleep!  I especially like that they offer some deleted scenes and special features on the last disc.  I'll certainly pick up all the seasons on DVD.
B000FC1K66|5.0|simply put, this story is amazing.  it is vivid, to the point, and wonderfuly written.
1439136653|4.0|This is a very easy read with a plot that reveals it's conceit after two or three chapters and then you know how the general outline will go for the rest of the novel.  I had seen the movie before I read it so I was prepared for the novel's gimmick.  I don't think it's a literary masterpiece but it's simple writing rather than simplistic.  It doesn't hide it's message in high-literary obscurantist prose that gets so much praise in hoi-polloi circles.  I think this is a rare case where the book and movie are about equal in their respective genres.  If one complains about outrageous coincidence, well, like others have said, that's the artistic territory you've entered.  For all the grim tragedy presented in both the film and the book, we're basically in fairy tale land.  You get a kind of happy ending in the book and a most definite happy ending in the movie where everybody lives happily ever after.  A Bollywood musical is dancing around in most character's minds in the book, and you get an actual Bollywood number at the end of Slumdog, that helps everyone get through their daily grind (which grind is more grindy than most grinds in the West).  They changed the love interest because (I' won't spoil the details) it wouldn't have translated to the big screen well at all.  Most of the details and hints of details made their way into the movie.
0679720200|5.0|When I first started reading it I was a little confused, hoping that each new page I turned would say something that would point to the actual purpose of the book. I didn't think it was a bad book I just simply didn't see any real point to it. 'Why would anyone write a book like this?' I thought to myself. 'I mean Meursault is just a completely self-centered loser, indifferent to life itself.' By the last chapter, however, when he is pondering about his imminent execution, the literacy styles describing the concepts of life and death towards an ordinary person with no real biases towards the world whatsoever, was so thought-proving and beautiful that it probably could have made Clint Eastwood cry within the movie Grand Torino. After finishing the book, however, I was still a little confused about what the point of the work was. Still even 3 days later, I was still pondering about it, replaying each chapter over in my head--which is always a definite sign of a good book. Finally, I came to possibly my first logical conclusion: Meursault's thoughts as he was waiting to be executed finally resulted in a basic theme of \\"well, we all gotta die sometime, so really, no big deal.\\" Moreover, I think the author was indirectly trying to imply that \\"yeah, we all going to die sometime, therefore, it's not actually death--how it's how or when you die--that's important, but, what you do on this earth and in life is important.\\" I believe that Meursault's final statement, \\"For all to be accomplished, for me to feel less lonely, all that remained to hope was that on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators and that they should greet me with howls of execration\\", characterized that theme up perfectly. It left me with the impression that Meursault has his final opportunity to make something memorable and meaningful out of his life, even if it was only his execution.
031606792X|5.0|I really haven't read the book yet, but I hear that it was probably the best book out of the series.
0679809015|5.0|Looks like a book that will be both educational and fun.  Can't wait to get it to my new great-grandson.
0743298039|1.0|I think that this is one of the creepiest books, that is rife with the smarmiest charactures, that I have read. It got so confusing, and so disgusting that I almost got through, but I just couldn't make it. Save your money. If you must have it, get it used.
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I thought this movie was quite good. If I have any complaints, it's that I'm not a fan of over-edited action scenes (though they're MUCH easier to follow on the DVD), the film is pretty humorlous, and the theme song is pretty poor.      I'm not surprised by the number of reviews that complain about the villain's motivations, which most reviewers boil down to \\"he wants to increase the price of water in Bolivia.\\" I think there's more to it than that, but the movie doesn't make it easy to piece together what's happening and why. I didn't really understand the full implications of the plot until after leaving the theater and thinking about what I'd seen.     I realize Bond films aren't meant to be overly cerebral, but this one does demand that viewers pay attention throughout (not really something we're used to when it comes to Bond films). The fast pace doesn't make it any easier. I agree that the action scenes harken back to Bourne (which actually harken back to Peter Hunt's editing of On Her Majesty's Secret Service), but the plot is definitely Bond-ian, with global implications, giant super-secret organizations, etc. Definitely not Bourne material. But like I said, you have to pay attention to what the various characters say and do in order to get it.     I had an opportunity to speak with a professional movie-reviewer after seeing the film and it was clear that a lot of details were getting past people. In this instance, the reviewer noted that he loved the scene at the bar where Rene Mathis asks Bond what he's drinking and Bond turns to the waiter to ask the same, as if he doesn't even know. My reviewer friend pointed to this as a sign of Bond's total disinterest in sensual pleasures. A sign that he's become such a hollow shell, a straightforward killing machine, that \\"shaken\\" or \\"stirred\\" doesn't even factor into his thinking anymore. And yet, the ingredients that the bartender lists in his reply to Bond's question are the same as those that Bond used when creating the martini in Casino Royale - the martini that he later named a \\"Vesper.\\" In this particular scene, he's had six of those particualar drinks. It's clear he knows exactly what he's drinking and that he's obsessed with finding out who forced Vesper to betray him.     The other thing to keep in mind when watching Quantum of Solace is this: Casino Royale was a very small incident related to the plot of QOS. Similarly, QOS is a small part of something making up a much larger conspiracy. My fear is that we're not likely to get the ending of this three part tale due to so many complaints about QOS.     SPOILER ALERT - Don't read any further if you haven't seen QOS yet     As to the plot being nothing more than Greene's desire to charge poor Bolivians more money for water, I think this shortchanges what's really going on. Greene doesn't care about the water. It's a means to an end. Yeah, he can charge poor people higher prices. Big deal. What he really wants is a way to control a puppet government. He arranges for the Bolivian general to be put in charge in exchange for ownership of a parcel of land. He gets the land and we discover that it enables him to control the water supply. He then makes it clear to the general that (he) the general will accede to Greene's demands or the Bolivian people won't be getting their water (and the general will be \\"replaced\\"). Greene doesn't just control a natural resource - Quantum now controls an entire third-world country. Greene references other third world countries where similar \\"changes in government\\" have taken place around the world. Is Quantum responsible for these as well? It's neve stated outright, but leaving the door open to interpretation is an intriguing morsel to chew over. It's not a stretch to assume that Quantum is toppling these and other governments and gaining control over them. One might think that control of a third-world country wouldn't be much of a threat until you really think about what's going on in the world today. Where do the real threats come from? What countries now make it a common practice to harbor terrorists? To support the drug trade? To kidnap Western tourists? The list goes on and on. For one criminal organization to have control over four, eight, a dozen, two-dozen or more third-world countries is downright terrifying.    So what we're getting in QOS is a glipse of this larger plot. A single example of what's happening around the globe. I was rather hoping that a third film in the series would lay bare Quantum's ultimate plan and reveal them to be a Spectre-class villain for a 21st-century Bond. I don't think it's going to happen though. Even though QOS made a ton of money, I expect the negative response from so many will scare the producers into taking the series in a less challenging, more conventional direction.     END SPOILERS     In any case, I found the film to be quite interesting. It really peaked my interest in seeing the third part of the story, by the end of which our much-loved Bond would have been completely forged into the super spy we all know and love.     I also liked the fact that by the end, Bond has found his \\"quantum of solace,\\" his small bit of comfort re: Vesper's death.     I definitely recommend the movie for a second viewing to catch the details that may have been missed the first time around. It's a different take on Bond, but one that I think works quite well - as good as most of the other Bond films in any case.
0132350882|4.0|Reading Clean Code will make you a better computer programmer.   Applying the programming techniques described in Clean Code to your work is like stripping layers of paint from fine wood work in an older home.  You end up with improvements that make life better.  Your source code will easier to understand, easier to test, and easier to maintain.  Other programmers will be able to understand it.    Clean Code has 17 chapters written by eight authors.  Most of the chapters are written by the principal author, Robert Martin.   With one exception, each chapter has a single author.   Each chapter tackles a different subject and covers the topic by breaking it down into a cohesive set of paragraphs, with each paragraph having a meaningful subtitle.  Even with eight authors, Clean Code reads like a book written by one voice.  The authors wrote this book with the same care they apply to their computer programs, by reducing its complexity to a system of small parts. It is a seamless piece of work.      Clean Code can be read three ways:   1) as a quick read, skipping most of the source code samples and case studies;  2) as the authors intended;  3) in a way not suggested by the authors-- read the text,  skip  large sections of Java code, and find your own examples and case studies  to convert from messy code into clean code.    The authors warn against the first option,  \\"This is not a feel good book that you read on an airplane and finish before you land.  ...  You'll be reading code--lots of code.  And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code and what's wrong with it.\\"  The authors want you to study each and every line of Java code listed in the book, and this book is loaded with examples and case studies.    They mean it.  Reading and understanding all of the examples and case studies in this book is daunting.     The problem for me, however, is that all of the examples are in Java and I'm a Delphi and a C++ programmer.   I took the third approach.  I studied the simple examples, but I glossed over the more complex case studies.   Instead, I applied the techniques to a C++ program that I had already programmed--making that code much, much better.  I worked quite hard at this, but not in the way the authors intended.   This book is applicable to all object oriented programming languages, not just Java.  It worked for me.        Clean Code explains how to make your code more readable by giving all variables meaningful names.  It explains how programs become polluted with out-of-date comments and how to write code that requires little or no comments.  It explains how to design and program classes that are small and easy to understand .  It is loaded with examples of refactoring  complex code into more simple code.  The authors speak from experience and all of their assertions are backed up with examples and case studies.    This book is loaded with ways to write better code.  Here are some examples:    \\"The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic).  Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic).  Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible.  More than three (polyadic) requires very special justification--and then shouldn't be used anyway.\\"  (I particularly like the terms niladic, monadic, dyadic, triadic, and polyadic.)    \\"Output arguments are harder to understand than input arguments.  When we read a function, we are used to the idea of information going in to the function through arguments and out through the return value.  We don't usually expect information to be going out through the arguments.  So output arguments often cause us to do a double-take.\\"    \\"Flag arguments are ugly.  Passing a Boolean into a function is a truly terrible practice.  It immediately complicates the signature of the method, loudly proclaiming that this function does more than one thing.  It does one thing if the flag is true and another if the flag is false!\\"    \\"Clear and expressivecode with few comments is far superior to cluttered and complex code with lots of comments.  Rather than spend your time writing the comments that explain the mess you've made, spend it cleaning that mess.\\"    \\"The first rule of classes is that they should be small.  The second rule is that they should be smaller than that.\\"    These quotes are only a small sample of better programming concepts that are so well described in this book.   The booked is filled with similar tips to write better software.  For example, Chapter 4:   Comments, has the best advice for writing comments that I've ever read.    The authors tell you what makes a bad comment and why most comments are, in fact, not very helpful. That chapter alone is worth the price of the book.  Chapter 7:   Error Handling, has a number of techniques on how to handle errors with \\"grace and style.\\"  These error handling  techniques make sense and their use results in more robust programs.    Even though all of the case studies and examples are in Java, reading this book should not be a problem for non-Java programmers.  With careful reading you can follow the examples and you will learn some Java as you read the book.   If you are not programming in an object oriented language, however, this book will make little sense.  A pre-requisite to reading Clean Code is proficiency in object oriented programming.    My one criticism of the book is that the authors are a bit dogmatic in saying that their techniques are the best.    For example, they disdain switch statements.  I didn't find their argument for their dislike of switch statements to be very compelling.   I can accept and forgive this, however, as their collective experience is impressive.  They speak from many years of experience.    Chapter 15:  JUnit Internals, has the best example. The author includes an example of high quality, clean code, taken from the Java framework.  Then the authors improve the code, explaining all of their changes as they go.  Theycall this the Boy Scout Rule:   \\"Leave the campground cleaner than you found it.\\"   They visited the code, studied it, and improved it, showing that even good code can become better code.  They left the code cleaner than they found it.    As a final note, Clean Code has a Kindle Edition for reading on the Amazon Kindle.

B000MRAAJW|2.0|Be Aware!  I was not familiar with the terms HDDVD compared to DVD and I  bought this - opened it and it would not work in the DVD player.  I thought the DVD or my player was broken - but it was just the wrong system.  Now I have a DVD that I can't use unless I spend hundreds of dollars on a new HDDVD player - I can't send it back because I opened it - and I have yet to see this wonderful series :(    There should be some kind of explanation for 'dummies of technology' like myself that it will only work in a specialized HDDVD player.  Oh well....

1582701709|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a lady who owns a jewelry store in 2007.  She gave a rave review of how it was helping her and her business to prosper.     After reading The Secret my life has been transformed!  I have become a much more positive thinking person, and it is having a wonderful impact on my life, and relationships. The Law of Attraction is evident in every area of everyone's life.  When one is made aware of the Law of Attraction one can change their very existence.  Knowing is the first step to successfully helping yourself to acquire the hearts desire.    The Secret should be a required read for everyone, but especially high school students!!!

B001PE26QQ|4.0|The recent film \\"Fearless\\" (2006) starring Jet Li paved the way for this superior biopic about (Y)Ip Man, master of Wing Chun, who was the first to openly teach the art to the public.  He is also known to modern kung fu fans as the teacher of the one and only Bruce Lee.  The movie concentrates on the early adult life of Master Ip, when he lives in relative peace with his wife and young son in the city of Foshan.  This film has the benefits of an outstanding performance by Donnie Yen, the period detail and storytelling ability of director Wilson Yip, and the fantastic action choreography of Sammo Hung.  Hung here is exploring some old territory, as he previously directed, choreographed, and co-starred in two Wing Chun movies which documented the lineage that led to Yip Man:  \\"Warriors Two\\" (1978) and \\"The Prodigal Son\\" (1982).  Both have accurate and exciting depictions of the close-quarters fighting style, but \\"Ip Man\\" blazes new trails.<br /><br />Ip Man is a nice, respectful fellow, who occasionally spars in friendly, closed-door matches with the local masters (of which there are many) in Foshan.  Though often asked to take students, Master Ip politely declines.  The happy and content life in Foshan ends with World War II when the Japanese take over the town.  With all prosperity gone, Master Ip is forced to take a job (I feel your pain, bro.) digging coal.  Soon the Japanese come by looking for fighters to spar with their soldiers.  When a friend goes to fight and never comes back, Ip decides to find out what happened.  His superior fighting abilities are witnessed by a Japanese General (Shibuya Tenma) who wants Master Ip to train his troops.<br /><br />Donnie Yen is as quick and graceful as ever.  He and a few of his cohorts seem to be the only ones in Hong Kong interested in actually improving fight choreography in film.  \\"SPL\\" and \\"Flashpoint\\" (both directed by Yip) each broke new ground in screen fighting techniques.  Hell, I'll even admit that \\"Dragon Tiger Gate\\" (again, directed by Yip) is one of the better wire-fu flicks that I've ever sat through.  What puts this on the same level with those is that Wing Chun is not really the kind of martial art that looks good on film.  Not only do Yen and Sammo Hung pull it off, they also do so without sacrificing the integrity of the art.  It's not entirely flawless, with some wire use, bad slo-mo, and a little bit of goofy editing, but it's still fantastic.  Also worth mentioning is the performance of Fan Siu Wong (\\"Story of Ricky\\") as a Northern master who defeats all the major players in Foshan.  We need to see more of him too!<br /><br />Now on to the DVD:  Distributed by Sun Jian Media, it has no chapter selection (though there are chapters you can dig through sequentially), no special features, and no subtitles when paragraph after paragraph of Chinese newsprint tries to tell us what's going on.  If you know anything about history, it's not too hard to figure out, but how flippin' difficult is it to translate that stuff when you're already covering the dialogue?  And a biopic needs special features!  I can't stress that enough.  Also, the subtitles that are there disappear too quickly.  Subtitles are never a deterrent for me, but I'm not a speed-reader.  Minor complaint, I suppose.  When a better DVD comes along, I'll gladly buy it again, as this is a bona fide classic.  In widescreen with beautiful picture quality.  Mandarin  language with English subtitles.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  4.5 of 5<br /><br />2008. aka:  Yip Manrected by Yip) is one of the better wire-fu flicks that I've ever sat through.

So you don't know beans about making beer but want to do some?  Well the very first chapter takes care of that right off.   From that point on, the only question is how sophisticated and involved do you want to get.     This is also one knockout resource book on the subject of brewing.      Very likely the best home brewing book out there, and I've got them all......  well, at least a half dozen.    ....and yes, I do read the other books as well!

B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles produced so much great music that it is difficult to say which album of their's I like the most.    Though there will be debates, Sgt Peppers is one of the albums that I consider a must have of their studio records. From the opening of the title track until the reprise it is clear why this is one of the classic records of all time.    With such well known songs as \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" some other songs \\"Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" get overlooked.  From the humorous and thoughtful \\"When I'm Sixty Four\\" to the haunting \\"She's Leaving Home\\" and \\"A Day In The Life\\" this record shows the range that makes The Beatles so special in rock.

1439102813|5.0|Gripped by the emotion of imagining what it might be like to receive the diagnosis that Alice Howland did at age 49, early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, it was difficult to read through the first few chapters.  However, I felt pulled to continue reading and soon became captivated by Alice's story.<br /><br />The author does a remarkable and credible job of providing an inside look at Alzheimer's Disease from the perspective of an individual who is living with this disease, and the gradual experience of losing a highly respected career, way of operating independently in the world, and, ultimately, the knowledge of who those closest to you are.<br /><br />The experience of reading this book was an emotional journey that underscored the importance and impact of compassion and appreciation for life's everyday joys. Heartbreakingly real, the author includes several issues that cause you to stop and ask yourself some difficult questions:<br /><br />-Would you want to know if you carried the gene for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease?<br /><br />-Would you have genetic testing on embryos to be implanted via invitro fertilization to ensure that they do not carry the gene for early-onset Alzheimer's Disease?<br /><br />-Would you want to continue living after you've lost your cognitive abilities?<br /><br />Next month, it's my turn to choose the book we'll read for my book club, and I will be choosing \\"Still Alice.\\"  There's much to be gained from reading this book, whether you know someone with Alzheimer's or not.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|While watching this film on the big screen just yesterday, I was struck by the realization that perhaps no other genre of film plays so heavily on architecture than the vampire film. This modern, contemporary, even human -- vampire story is no different, but is also very different. Rather than the cliche dark forboding castle or gothic mansion, we have the unsettling normalcy of the empty spaces of the modern world. In fact, it is through this interplay between the entrapment of enclosed spaces and the vulnerability of open spaces that most of this film's suspense is built. That, and the crossing over from the lighted space to the dark and vice versa are deftly, almost subliminally, handled. Two scenes, edited crisply together, really represent the permeability of thresholds (and our blithe obliviousness to them) quite aptly -- young Oskar shuts the lights off in an empty classroom, and then steps from the darkened space of the room to the well lit hallway. Instantly we are edited to a shot of him emerging from the well lit building into the darkened space of the out of doors on a wintery Swedish afternoon, where the trio of bullies await. Almost all of the most tiresome and cliche aspects of the vampire legend, with all its baggage, are missing here. By having the main characters so young, and the girl as vampire, the legend is interestingly DE (and then RE) sexualized. In an awkward scene with Oskar, his estranged father and another man (dad's gay partner?) the theme of lonliness and heartache is lingered over yet again. There are also overtones of Von Sternberg's \\"The Blue Angel\\" (the clown who lingers in Lola Lola's shadow that we encounter when Emil Janning's professor character first meets her...) that inform this films conclusion (No spoilers here!) Like everyone else says, this film is beautifully shot, wonderfully lit by the natural glow of the dying sun and the eerie glare of the incandescent bulbs of walkways, intersections, bridges. Besides Murnau's historic \\"Nosferatu\\" and Herzog's romantic remake of same, I've never had much use for the vampire film. This is a very special film -- one you'll think about for days after seeing it. You might not be scared, but you will be haunted.
0736063684|5.0|This type of book has been an interest of mine for quite some time.  I have always wanted a book that would give a lot of different exercises for each part of the body and show the specific muscles it works.  This book doesn't just show the area it works.  It shows the muscles in that area that it works.  For example:  We all know that there is tricep push downs, triceps rope pull downs, and tricep reverse grip pull downs.  Well which exercise works each different head.  This book will tell you.  I have taken this book and broke it down into my own work outs.  I have two seperate sets.  1. Chest/Back, Bi's/Tri's, Shoulders/Legs and then another rotation of different exercises 2 Chest/Back, Bi's/Tri's, Shoulders/Legs.  This way my muscles will never get used to the same workout.

And when they're not, the kids often don't like them!  The Grufalo wins both readerships:  it's clever, has depth, and a moral to it if you like that sort of thing.  There is also a nice existential closure after all the cavorting of all the carnivores:  \\"the mouse found a nut and the nut was good.\\" Lovely images too, deep rich hues and nice definitions. This one will last.

B000UNYJXQ|4.0|This film is incendiary, polarizing, engrossing, and at times sensationalistic. But I'm grateful for it. Whether or not you agree that America should adopt a universal health care program, I'm hoping that people like Moore bringing the topic into the mainstream will help perpetuate a dialogue about American health care, which, I think most people can agree, seems to be heading quickly to ruin.<br /><br />What the film does a good job of pointing out is that there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the health care profession, which is about healing and preventing illness, and the business world. Insurance companies make more money when they are able to find ways to deny people's claims. The result is the kind of horror stories that \\"Sicko\\" puts on display.
0198326769|5.0|Much is missing in this story told from the perspective of a nine-year-old boy whose father is the Kommandant of Auschwitz. I was not even sure if my high or middle school students would recognize what it was about.  They do recognize the setting and they do find the cheery voice of the child wending his way through unmistakably dark times a compelling read. The missing specifics make this story read like a folk tale, without time and place, with an edge of unreality, and with completely familiar human truths.    A boy's world consists of his imagination, his friendships, his ongoing struggle to make sense of the adult world that swirls around him. This boy, Bruno, appears at first glance to be unduly naive.  But  he is not naive; the belief that comfort can exist alongside absolute cruelty is naive. That  perspective is like a knife cutting through the twisted intentions of the severely misguided adults, laying bare the only truth: no safe haven exists unless it exists for all.    Even with its lack of factual detail, this book is clearly about a terrible time in history, the Holocaust. While strong readers as young as eight could read this book, parents may want to decide when their child is ready for this information and might want to read it together. Middle and high school kids should be fine with it. In fact, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas is one of those books that can be read and appreciated by all ages of readers.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Let me set one thing straight, I LOVE movies that make you think. My boyfriend and I watched this waiting for the moment where everything clicked, but there was no moment. This movie is a mess. It has too many characters that are never explained and seems like 4 different movies wrapped in one. Anyone who thought this was a stroke of genius needs to get out more and watch more quality films. If you like putting together puzzles that are missing half the pieces, or contain pieces from multiple puzzles, this one is for you!

B0000DJZA5|4.0|I only bought this because I couldn't find my original CD. I have to say, it is more thematically consistant and less disheveled sounding then the original. It's not remarkably different in terms of the mixes, but the track listing makes more sense and the exclusion of the little bits and pieces makes it sound more like a finished product and less like a demo. Paul McCartney was right, the Long and Winding Road does sound better this way.

This device allows you to move around, at the end of the cord, and to hold a keyboard and assign keys that gives your hands the right feel, the gaming comfort.<br /><br />So I hooked it onto my old computer, and it did not recognize any of the games.  The pre-set templates are for up-to-date games.  You can quite easily program it, once you watch a little training video very carefully, and translate it into your tiny brain (my tiny brain, in this case).<br /><br />Then I moved it to the new computer, where it recognized a few more games.  It was fairly easy to set up for multiple games.  It lacked a trigger for shooting games, and some of the key transfers were not intuitive, but all in all, it made playing easier on the neck and shoulders.<br /><br />This device would be a major necessity for a serious player spending hours on one or two major games.  For a family of players who move between Sponge Bob and more serious games and back again, it was less necessary, seemed more of a luxury.  For the price, this is a great deal for a very serious gamer, and not really necessary for the 3 hours per week guy.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I know the focus is on the special effects, but I am excited just to see the complete stories again. I watched these episodes as a boy when they first came out and over and over again in syndication. I read in one of the Gerrold books that local engineers would shorten scenes to make more time in the hour for advertisements. There is more backstory depth in Mudd's Women that I hadn't seen in years, and a bridge officer that I had completely forgotten.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|After listening to Tonight: Franz Ferdinand for a week or so now, I'm really getting high on this new record. Man, thank God there's still a rock and roll band out there that's still dedicated to making great sounding, clever, and risky songs with cool lyrics. Love the synths on this record and consider that a brilliant incorporation into the songs. I'd say Tonight is a bit more progressive than the previous two albums and that is a good thing. Better than regressive and boring.<br /><br />Tonight is an absolutely sensational rock record. Get it. Get it Tonight.
B001B1876G|4.0|You can disregard the other customer reviews as they are just people rating their inability to purchase the product they wanted. If you couldn't read the product information page far enough to see that this was a Marvel animated movie and not the live action movie starring Robert Downey Jr that is your own problem. Please don't write negative reviews of something that have nothing to do with the actual product. That is dishonest and doesn't help your fellow online shoppers.    That being said if you like Marvel's other animated movies (The Avengers, The Avengers 2, Dr. Strange etc...) then you will like this movie. The animation is top notch and the voice work is decent. It is a well done Iron Man origin story and I hope to see more animated movies in Marvel's future.
B001PR0XYA|4.0|Like Antonio Banderas in \\"The 13th Warrior\\" and Director Robert Zemeckis in his 2008 CGI film, \\"Outlander\\" takes on the classic tale of Beowulf, but unlike those films it does it with a sci-fi twist. The \\"Grendel\\" monster in this film has celestial origins much like the titular Outlander played by Jim Caviezal. The monster design was one of the most pleasantly surprising aspects of the film; its look was unique and had the right mix of cool and creepy.     Some drawbacks to this film include a few flashback scenes with weak CGI, relatively uncharismatic male leads, and a few odd casting choices--John Hurt as a Viking king? In contrast the wonderful Ron Perlman was cast perfectly yet sorely underused. Those complaints aside, \\"Outlander\\" is overall a tightly paced, action packed, and entertaining take on the English language's oldest adventure tale.
0060935464|5.0|The only thing I can't figure out is WHY I never read this before.  Apparently, it wasn't required reading in high school.  But I'm ever so glad I finally got to reading it.<br />It was brilliant and I can easily understand how this novel has withstood the test of time.  I saw that it was still one of the best books of 2008.  I can't say anymore than has already been said on this novel, except if you, by chance, haven't read it yet....do yourself a favor and enjoy a classic.<br />Scout and Atticus are characters that live on in your memory long after that last page is read.
0061139378|5.0|When I saw the NY Times blurb on the paperback cover saying what a scary story this was, I was concerned about handing it over to my 9-year-old granddaughter to read alone... so I decided to read it first. And I couldn't put it down! When my granddaughter came over that weekend, we started reading it aloud together. I had to tell her at 11:30 p.m. that we needed to finish it the following week, because my voice was getting tired. We are both captivated by this dark, imaginative world that explores family ties, loneliness, love, good, evil, loyalty and bravery. And for a girl who insists she doesn't like to read, my granddaughter can't wait to finish this book!
B001CTDH4Y|5.0|I was waiting for this movie to come out because we own a Chihuahua but was wondering if it was going to be really good or really bad?  I loved it! It was funny, happy, good teaching lessons for my kids and it even had a little romance.  We are buying this DVD for sure. It needs to go in our Disney collection.  Take the time to watch it, it is worth it.
0307454894|5.0|This book was so beautifully written that even though the subject matter was a bit difficult, it made one hunger to read on. There was a kind of distancing in the language that made the story both plausible and bearable for the reader.  It is well worth reading.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I believe no one understands and depicts, with sympathy for (almost) all, the complexities and ironies of living in the United States and being an American better than Clint Eastwood.  Not too many even try, preferring the simple shorthand of good guys and bad guys that Clint left behind better than two decades ago.  My pick for his personal turning point?  The small elegant A Perfect World.         Gran Torino, while not at the peak of Eastwood's acting and directing work like Unforgiven, Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, and Letters from Iwo Jima, gives us a broken-down former industrial powerhouse, immigrants building a new beginning and adding to America's cultural richness, and an individual hung between a finished past and trying to make sense of a changing present, where manners and what matters seem to have been lost even among the man's own.  It is the classic Eastwood dry humor touch that he begins to embrace that present through an afternoon of eating delicious Hmong food.  Only thing I would change about Gran Torino -- a little less monosyllabic grunting, please.      Gran Torino, like everything Eastwood has done for the last twenty years or so and everything we'll be lucky enough to get in the future, is not to be missed.

0553807048|3.0|I'm confused by Jordan's delusion of grandeur whereby he assumes `everyone' knew who he was and what he was doing both during his `hey day' and afterwards.  If, during the time of his Stratton days, you'd asked 1000 Wall street people if they'd ever heard of Belfort or Stratton Oakmont, I guarantee you 997 of them would say no.  If you'd asked 1000 non-Wall street people, 1000 would never had heard of him or Stratton...assuming they weren't clients.  The only reason I ever heard of Stratton was that my firm cleared his trades.  By the way, Jordan (early in the book) states that his clients \\"...could have sold their shares anytime they wanted to...\\"  Not quite.  If I had a dime for every Stratton customer who called my firm complaining about their inability to sell, I'd be living in Old Brookville.
0375758992|4.0|Some may find Alexandra Fuller's tribute to Africa a little unnerving.  \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" traces not an easy childhood, but one punctuated by war, racism, death, disease, and hardship.  A group of British expats, the Fullers begin as members of the ruling class in Rhodesia to become the ousted class in Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Zambia, withstanding sometimes unimaginable trials and tribulations to stay in the continent to which they are, perhaps masochistically, drawn.  This is a unique kind of buildingsroman set amongst the frayed ends of British colonialism in Africa that I would imagine most would find utterly fascinating.  However, I wish I had a better knowledge of the history of this area and found myself lost at times as Fuller, affectionately known as \\"Bobo\\" by her family, sped through some of the historical background, names, and facts.<br /><br />If you are concerned that this book is going to turn into a huge downer, rest assured this is not a depressing slog of a book that will have you reaching for your xanax.  If I were to describe another African childhood in which a main character grapples with famine, murder, and betrayal - I doubt your mind would immediately turn to Disney's \\"The Lion King.\\"  It is all about how these themes are incorporated into the story and Fuller does so elegantly and sometimes quite humorously.  Do not let your eyes glaze over upon seeing the words \\"tragic\\" and \\"haunting\\" on the book jacket.<br /><br />There is a pervading sense of honesty surrounding this book. Every character is exposed under the brightest light, even if that light proves unflattering, and Fuller does so without shame or apology. This is simply the way things were. The \\"honesty is the best policy\\" approach rings true for this novel and, despite the flaws and failures of this family, the story is robust and the central characters oddly endearing. I could see myself picking this book up again in the future because it was inherently readable and because in some ways it made me feel like a kid whose parents invited a dinner guest with some seriously entertaining, cannot believe things like that actually happened, eyes wide mouth hanging open stories to tell.ways it made me feel like a kid whose parents invited a dinner guest with some seriously entertaining, cannot believe things like that actually happened, eyes wide mouth hanging open stories to tell.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|This movie is inconsistent with any other history I have read or seen about Henry VIII and this period in England.  The movie makes Mary out to be so innocent and timid when she is forced to go to the King's bed.  Any others portray Mary as a wh*re in both the French Court and the English Court.  The \\"Movie Tie-In\\" book by Gregory contains little to no similarities with the movie.  The movie also makes very poor use of it's nearly 2 hours in providing any sort of in depth look into this period in Henry VIII's life.
B000EHSVS2|1.0|The Movie,excellent,5 stars def. The reason I give it 1 star is,is that the quality of the disks,both of them,was so poor that they got hung-up on the very first attempt to play them,on 2 different players! Absolute rubbish. I will never buy a dvd from amazon again.

0930289234|5.0|Without a doubt , from a writers perspective, one of the best pieces of fiction writing I have ever read. Extremely thought provoking , and although it was written in early to mid-eighties,still very relevant for today socially. Because it can be so in depth at times I think the casual reader will not understand and even get lost at times, which would mean it won't appeal to everyone.I understand why some people are disappointed with the ending , but to quote an old saying :\\"it's not the destination,but the jouney\\".In my opinion, a journey wll worth it

Tokyo Godfathers is magical and heartwarming. A truly delightful anime film about friendship, love and miracles ... with a perfect ending.

B00003CXD5|5.0|ESSENTIAL MOVIE!!! The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is a timeless story about greed & distrust. The story takes place in Mexico in the early part of the twentieth century. Fred C. Dobbs (Bogart) is a down-on-his-luck American bumming his way through every day. He will barely work & it's easy to see he's not a nice person. The director, John Huston, has a cameo role as an American who Dobbs puts the bite on three times in the same day.    Dobbs meets Curtin (Tim Holt) who become co-workers for a less than scrupulous American who doesn't pay them. They force McCormick (Barton McLane) to pay them. Dobbs had also bought a lottery ticket earlier in the story from a young Mexican boy (Robert Blake). The windfall from the lottery ticket & his wages has Dobbs dreaming about other things. When Dobbs & Curtin end up at a flophouse they overhear an old man, Howard (Walter Huston) talking about gold mining. This really gets Dobbs to thinking & he convinces the other two into searching for gold. Dobbs puts up the bulk of the money for their supplies; Curtin has his stake also & Howard will provide the experience & know-how.    All of this is pretty amazing considering that Dobbs is inherently lazy. Even the warnings from Howard about the hard work & mistrust between partners doesn't stem his enthusiasm.    Howard leads them into the Sierra Madre, a wild & remote area. Dobbs & Curtin find it hard keeping up with the old man, both becoming somewhat discouraged at the effort needed. But when Howard finds the gold Dobbs & Curtin become enthusiastic, Dobbs especially.    Dobbs begins to work hard probably for the first time in his life. When Howard & Curtin start talking about when to stop after a certain monetary figure, Dobbs disagrees with their figure. The gold bug has bitten him & he wants more. Dobbs becomes increasingly paranoid distrusting both of his partners. He becomes so paranoid that he thinks that they want to kill him for his share. So, in order to protect his interest, he starts plotting their demise. Dobbs spirals downward eventually shooting Curtin & leaving him for dead.    In the end Dobbs is killed by some Mexican bandits. The gold is scattered to the winds & months of hard work is gone.     The film is beautifully restored. There are many bonus features, so many that an extra disc is included. There is an audio commentary track for the entire film by Eric Lax. There is \\"Warner Night at the Movies 1948\\" hosted by Leonard Maltin. Other features on disc one include a newsreel; a comedy short, \\" So You Want to Be a Detective\\" & a cartoon, \\"Hot Cross Bunny\\".    Disc two has \\"Discovering Treasure: The Story of the Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\". This a new documentary that features a multitude of personalities discussing aspects of the film. These include Martin Scorsese, Eric Lax, Leonard Maltin & Robert Osborne. There are many other bonus features included on the disc.

B000AM1TGC|5.0|There's probably very little I can add to all the other reviews for Voyage of the Acolyte other than to repeat what an absolutely fantastic album this really is.  While I don't believe every song is worth a 5 star rating, I feel that this album as a whole is such a pure expression of 70's progressive rock that it deserves every accolade it's received.  This CD hits all the right buttons in terms of original concepts, melodic content, production and execution.    The mini-suite on side one, Ace of Wands through Hands of the Priestess Pt.2, is truly one of the great moments in symphonic rock.  Especially since at the time of its original release I don't think many Genesis fans thought Steve Hackett could pull off a whole solo album.  In the context of the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis, Steve was very much an ensemble member and rarely took the spotlight.  In hindsight its obvious there was a lot more to his abilities and ambitions than anyone thought.  What I love most about this album (and his output in the 70's in general) his ability to sustain an overarching theme and mood across an album.    I know not every prog-fan agrees, but for me this CD stands shoulder-to-shoulder with great albums like \\"Close to the Edge\\", \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" and Genesis' own \\"Lamb lies down on Broadway\\".  And, the remastering here is excellent and Rutherford and Collins really shine as a rhythm section.  Truly a joy to listen to.

Two out of Three Ain't Bad is a very good example. The song tells the story of a girl breaking up with her boy and explains why she is leaving him. Of the four songs released from this album, only three of them charted. I am giving Bat Out of Hell an AAAA++++.

141690977X|4.0|I really think this book is useful for women who are wondering why they seem to be doing all the heavy lifting in a relationship -- the ones who wait by the phone, who cancel plans at the last minute, who make excuses for bad behavior. That's all: if your stomach is telling you this isn't the start of a relationship of mutual respect and liking, *especially* if you are feeling lousy about yourself, it's time to move on.    That's all. I truly think it's just designed to help women think about how they might be starting or continuing go-nowhere relationships. Of course it's not useful for the nitty-gritty of a serious, long-term relationship. That is much too complicated for a little book like this. People make comments like, 'of course no one should be spending time with an abuser, a married man, or an alcoholic,' as though it never happens. It happens all the time, and often because the women involved think they will be different. If they work hard enough he'll eventually become honest, considerate, sober, and unattached. Not gonna happen.    Should there be a companion book for men? Absolutely. There are plenty of women out there who should have warning signs on their foreheads, and men would be well-advised to leave relationships with these charmers pronto. If she is rude to you and your family, inconsiderate, abusive, overly demanding, an alcoholic or drug user, etc., YES, you should say goodbye immediately because you deserve someone who treats you decently. And that's really what it's all about.
1594201927|3.0|Rather than providing a detailed \\"financial history of the world\\" or a history of finance, Ferguson has strung together a bunch of anecdotes and episodes.  Some of these do contribute to a history of finance since they describe the creation of new financial instruments such as loans, bonds, stocks, mortgages, derivatives, and insurance; or famous financial crises such as the market collapse just before World War I, the Great Depression, and the 2007-8 financial meltdown.  Others are really just pointing out the importance of finance to various non-financial historical events including the Renaissance, the French Revolution, the Napoleonic Wars, and the American Civil War.  All this is jumbled together to match the script Ferguson laid out for the associated TV program and jumps backwards and forwards in time a lot.    But Ferguson also felt compelled to comment on many other topics which are not really required but allow him to share his opinions on these topics while he has an audience.  For example, he includes sections on the emergence of the social welfare state in Western economies and an attempt to eradicate it in Chile, allowing him to advocate privatization of social security.  He also visits Memphis and Detroit so he can talk about (and show) areas suffering high foreclosure rates. He starts off his chapter on market bubbles by visiting the Andes mountains of South America, mentioning an American company (which he does not yet name) that built big gas pipelines there; he does indicate later in the chapter that the company was Enron, but the reference to their South American pipeline was completely superfluous and obviously geared toward a dramatic visual in the TV program.    Finally, he throws in two more ideas.  The first is \\"Chimerica\\" which refers to the combination or \\"dual country\\" of China and America.  While the idea is interesting and the neologism clever, the section is not really required; it is however relevant in that it provides an example ofhow deep financial ties between two powerful, modern countries affects their interactions on all levels.  The second is his own theory of evolution within the financial world based on a paper he wrote; this seemed less relevant to me and another example of Ferguson just wanting to share another one of his ideas.    Overall, the most interesting parts of the book are those that focused on historical events up to the Great Depression including both the creation of new types of finance and the impact of finance (or lack of it) on historical events.  I found Ferguson's commentary on recent events much less interesting; but then he probably would not have sold as many copies.
B001P5Q6F2|5.0|Lamb of God have always combined the thrashy sound of classic 80's American death metal with the technical chops of the modern revivalists, and with this album they've finally combined the best of both worlds. While their fearsome musical chops have always been prominent, here Lamb of God have surged to the top of the modern metal heap with serious advances in songwriting. They're smart enough to know that true heaviness comes not from non-stop bashing and screaming, but from shifting dynamics and manipulation of the listener's mood.<br /><br />In particular, Mark Morton and Willie Adler (guitar) and John Campbell (bass) have arranged themselves into a solidly choreographed team with a cooperative plan of attack. That makes the quiet sections of this album, like the acoustic intros to \\"Grace\\" and \\"Reclamation,\\" all the more effective in building the heavy mood. This album's shifting dynamics also come not just from faithful riffage, but in creative timing changes and jarring breaks in the sonic delivery, all of which supply a brutal groove to the album's most terrifying tracks - \\"Broken Hands\\" and \\"Choke Sermon.\\" Lesser metal hacks can't come close to this sort of brutality by just bashing ahead at full speed all the time.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Lamb of God's secret weapon continues to be stupendous drummer Chris Adler, who delivers the heaviest of metal drumming through tightly controlled aggression. Unlike the lumbering elephants that pass for drummers in nu-metal, Chris Adler is a coiled snake always on the verge of a fatal strike. Also, lead screamer Randy Blythe has finally become a full-fledged vocalist, totally delivering on his potential. Previously, Blythe mostly stuck with the monotonous cookie monster growl that makes most of today's metal vocalists sound exactly the same. But he's always dropped hints that he's capable of far more, and here he adds a full helping of personality to the band's chops, especially in the vocally ominous \\"Set to Fail.\\" After many years of development and evolution, Lamb of God have fully delivered on both chops and songwriting, with maturity and experience. They're heavier than ever. [~doomsdayer520~]velopment and evolution, Lamb of God have fully delivered on both chops and songwriting, with maturity and experience. They're heavier than ever.

0060760710|5.0|This recording of the first Paddington stories is extremely well done.  Stephen Fry reads with enthusiasm and the right intonation for each part.  My five year old daughter listens while in the car, and enjoys the stories.  I will buy other readings.
1594201927|3.0|I am an enormous fan of Ferguson's \\"Empire\\", and of the author's many essays -- but the \\"Ascent of Money\\" is not his greatest work.  If you're looking for the fine tooth comb of Ferguson's meticulous historical approach -- you won't find it here.  Ferguson jumps from one financial innovation to another, providing isolated anecdotes and brief historical accounts without delving deeper into economic theory of philosophy. While such a book may not have been Ferguson's aim -- his overly punctuated account loses continuity because it is so disconnected from a larger picture. What results is more of Michael Lewis and less Niall Ferguson.  It's an entertaining read, but scholarly history it is not.

0545128285|5.0|As a long-time Harry Potter fan, I loved, not only the series, but the whole aspect of the magical world that surrounded Harry Potter. That being said, I always knew there was more depth in the world of Harry Potter THAN Harry Potter. Many of the reviews have complained that either the book didn't add anything to the series, or it was written for kindergardeners, or it was inappropriate for kindergardeners, or that it was boring for adults.    I like to think in a more objective term about books, music, and movies. I think that aside from entertainment, they serve and artistic purpose. Harry Potter should not be excluded. The books, even though they have earned millions, are still an artistic expression. The Tales of Beedle the Bard is a form of artistic expression.    Having said that, I would like to point out that the reason some people probably think the book is only deemed interesting by kindergardeners is because in the wizarding world, it WOULD have been read or told to children from that age group. The point of The Tales of Beedle the Bard was NOT to add something to the series, it was a kind of cute and creative way for J.K. Rowling to add depth to the world of magic she created in her books and not make it completely about Harry Potter. By the stories resembling something that would be told to a child, it makes the other-worldly fairy tale aspect more real and authentic.    The reason the books held the commentary by Albus Dumbledore was because the tales were highly symbolic in many aspects. So the character of Dumbledore, which is a figure of wisdom and comfort in the series, offers a simple explanation and witty anecdotes for the reader to better understand the content of the stories.    Looking at the book in an objective point of view, I think the stories are very well written, and though may seem gruesome (The Warlock's Hairy Heart, for example), they do not underestimate a child's capacity to intake some concepts. In other words, the stories do notunderestimate a child's intelligence. I thought that by presenting stories that would not underestimating a child's intelligence, Rowling is enforcing one of the themes she presents in the books, which is respect and consideration for the worries and opinions about everyone, regardless of their age, gender, or race. By having Dumbledore give examples of revolts against the content in the stories, it clearly shows how adults underestimate the capacity children can have. I think it's hilarious that the same behavior that Dumbledore complains about in the commentary, is the same behavior that is present in many of the 1-star reviews.    I think if you disliked the book, then that's fine. I just think that when you give a review you should give full, concrete reasons why you disliked it instead of saying it was boring or way beneath your intellectual capacity (although if the former is the case, then I don't think you were reading well enough to appreciate the metaphorical content). If you think it's inappropriate for young children, then that's fine too. Everyone is entitled to their own ways of parenting and opinions on what is and isn't appropriate for children to read. In that case, by all means, write a 1-star review and explain why you deem it inappropriate for children.

B0017ANAZO|1.0|I really want to simply state the experience of this film:    Night out with women film. NO one was looking for a GREAT movie, just to laugh a bit and be entertained.    then..    We just stared at the screen, all 9 of us, with that weird \\"wow this is still not funny\\" frozen smile - like when old uncle Charlie tells that same old joke at holiday time, you know, THAT smile.
031606792X|5.0|As far as the ending of series go, this was a great way to end.  Of course, most of us wish that books like these could go on forever, but we all know that they can't.  This book not only tied up a lot of loose ends (like why Alice can't see werewolves) and ended in the right spot, but Ms. Meyer once again managed to find a way to keep up that \\"Oh God please no what are you DOING\\" feeling that we have experienced through the rest of the saga.  This book definitely brings out the complexity of each character while staying completely true to them.  Breaking Dawn has managed to bring about the happy ending most of us thought would be impossible.    Enjoy!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|If you knew some one who had never seen a Quentin Tarantino film and you tried to help them to understand one by telling them about them, like mentioning how he writes a lot of dialog and there's a not so subtle foot fetish, the references to older films from the 70's and his own films, strong female roles, no CG, violence and language, and then they tried to make a Quentin Tarantino film based on what you told them. And it didn't work on ANY level. Yeah, that's how this film feel like. A sad parody a Quentin Tarantino film.
B001RIY49C|1.0|Has any body else noticed that the only thing new in this collectors set is the skynet edition and the endoskull. The extreme and ultimate editions seem to be on regular dvd, I would guess a lot of us already own them. While it would be cool to have the skull, I just can't see spending all that money.
B001MYIQFE|1.0|You would think paying double the price of the stock CD would mean high quality, right?  You'd be wrong.  The Audio Fidelity release of this CD is a huge ripoff - unfortunately, I didn't learn of this until after I purchased and played the CD.    The HDCD encoding is faulty, resulting in both of my HDCD players switching back and forth between HDCD and no HDCD during some tracks.      Also, the artwork and liner notes on this version are horrendous!      Audio Fidelity is quickly becoming the Bose of audiophile CDs: all marketing and no quality.  They should spend less money touting their 'Kensei Audio Transformer', whatever that is, and more into QA.    Sincerely,   A Disappointed Listener    Update: as posted elsewhere, there are gaps between tracks that were not present on the original album.  So I bought a bastardized \\"audiophile\\" version of the original, and I paid through the nose for it.  Thumbs down!!!
B000H5V8DG|5.0|I love this series, it took me a month and a half to finish it. It was well worth the money and one of the best purchases I ever made. It keeps you addicted from the beginning to the end!
B000002KAT|5.0|Why, after 40 years since its initial release, do people talk about this album as if it were a holy thing?  Because it is holy.  It's sacred, beautiful, almost an equivalent of a deeply religious experience.<br /><br />This is one of the most astonishing debuts in music history.  As anyone familiar with Van Morrison knows, he started out in a rock band called Them with the song Gloria.  Then he went solo, and he recorded this gem in a mere 2 days.  Reportedly, he hardly talked to the musicians on the album, but that's not surprising.  It's a feeling, a being with Van here.  This album is so moving, esoteric, and individualistic that if Van Morrison never made another album, this would still be considered a classic.  Luckily, Van is still recording to this day.  The album encompasses almost every known musicial genre....<br /><br />jazz and blues and folk, poetry and jazz, voice and music, music and no music, silence and then voice, music and writing, words, memories, memories way back....<br /><br />Not rushing, being...<br /><br />The title track, the wonderful epic Madame George (my favorite song on the album), the soaring Cyrpus Avenue, well, everything about it.  It's not a polished effort, but it ain't supposed to be.  It's a pulse of a brilliant man, a brilliant artist.<br /><br />To quote Van himself, \\"it ain't why, it just is\\".<br /><br />While Van has made many more brilliant albums (his most recent studio effort Keep It Simple is astonishingly good), many still revere this solo debut of his, an album that grows in wonder and mystery the more you engage it.  It grows deeper and deeper into you.
B00005QIPH|1.0|yes indeed, the question should be is this it??? To be utterly boring, mundane and redundant. Yawn. I may be the only nonfanboy in my groupies of folks who hail bands like the yeah,yeah, yeah's, ok go, 3oh3!, the killers [n-radio-killed the fanfare fanboys](more mainstream), dashboard (set me up a bump on suicide alley) confessional (hardcore emo fanboys), Atreyu (neverending story they know not of fanboys), and cute is what we aim for (my pathetic groupie fanboys who still have mom do their wash) and the ever growing on me, but when I first heard them I sighed, 'oh another' (death cab for cutie 'oh you arent hardcore enough for me to talk music to because your plugs arent organic and your lipring isnt large enough, and your hair isnt in your face enough on your left eye for your myspace friend request preteen network)....if Coldplay is the stuff that makes you have runs in the hotel bathroom from drinking the tap water in Manila or Cabo, then the Strokes is the kind of non CBGB type excrement that your typical want-to-be Lester Bangs type reviewer in the Village Voice throws some magical prose around and hails the band as the next greatest thing since Christ raising Lazarus from the dead......or Spin Magazine perhaps saying 'the coolest band on earth...'  Say what???? Say, uh, what son???? I believe this boy has some serious issues, give me a second while I whip this out:<br /><br />I firmly believe the Strokes sound is that of garage whinos, who have a look that is anything but trendy, and everything that your typical RISD/New School student thrives upon, while the transient with medical issues plays guitar in washington square park in the summers, perhaps with inclinations of Peter, Bjorn and John and wondering in 2001 and 2 and 3 how the Strokes are the most engaging band to come around in years, a style perhaps all their own, with a look that screams 'take a bath' and sounds more like a sound I'd make after indigestion sets in from a good Mexican meal.<br /><br />The Strokes will never attain anything but their underground base of wanna-be twenty-somethings, still humping that American Dream of 'different', screeching their sounds with their lackluster outfits, and are as uncool, as unhip and as awfully sounding as the next gutter-indie band bent on making a non intentional hip scene onto an already saturated one with the soon to become has-been's.<br /><br />The Strokes????

B000PMLFRA|1.0|Agreed. Just do the originals. I haven't heard whether or not these are going to be the originals or the later ones with all the added nonsense but if it is I will not be buying it (which is sad considering I own the film in VHS and DVD format and would love to add it to my BluRay Collection).
B00003CXAT|5.0|Well, I have to hand it to Steven Spielberg, even though he often annoys me. He made us pay attention to archeology and the Ark Of The Covenant; he educated us on Great White Sharks; he made us love an ugly little space alien and he even made Whoopi Goldberg look good. Wow, say what you will, the man has done some amazing things in the world of film. Here, he brings dinosaurs back to life and gives us another classic adventure story, unlike anything seen up to this time.    I rank this one right up with the best of all-time among great adventure stories. Few people can forget how stunned they were when they viewed these life-like dinosaurs for the first time on screen. And who can forget the T-Rex in the first frightening scene and the Raptors in the last intense scene? This is truly memorable stuff. To this day, those scenes can still get your attention.    The movie has always been fun to watch, and not just because of the thrills or special effects, of which there are too many to recite here. There is humor in here and characters are interesting, led by Richard Attenborough as the scientist who creates Jurassic Park. The kids in here - Joseph Mazello and Ariana Richards - do a fine job of acting, as good as the adults.    The only thing left is to see this in high-definition Blu=Ray, which should bring another generation of fans to this innovative film.
B001U8ZSCG|3.0|This is a great collection of songs, all originals and beautifully remastered to sound amazing and all that.  Unfortunately most of these songs may be in your collection already, they are pretty common on classic rock stations and greatist hits collections.    I haven't seen the movie but judging by the high-tech commercials I've seen for it, this soundtrack is far from what I was expecting to hear, I thought maybe they were remixed or something.    In any case, if you are missing most of these songs and enjoy them then I recommend this album.  This is actually a nice setlist, kinda downtempo so it's not something to throw in at a party exactly.
0765342294|3.0|Definitely an interesting book--finished it in a couple days. The writing isn't that great (i.e. I would never compare this to Hemingway, --or any of the great sci-fi writers--etc) but the idea was still intriguing and held me most of the way through.  The premise and constant moral dilemmas portrayed are very much the centerpiece disguised in a very action-oriented plot-line (read: sparse \\"telling\\" scenes rather than \\"showing\\" scenes & character development). In other-words, it isn't too sophisticated though it tries to be and is definitely a \\"young adult\\" book, both in how it's written and (lack of) depth of knowledge covered.    Still, quick, entertaining read --it's ambitious in a couple ways and definitely a conversation piece.      However--on a personal note, after reading some of the author's essays/comments regarding many \\"big issues\\", it's clear he's got some real troubling agendas that I don't agree with and find at best, disheartening and at worst, ignorant, fanatical & hateful (it's like finding out someone is a total racist or scientologist). I'm glad I only picked up a used copy of this book as I certainly don't want to patronize him in anyway.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Visually stunning recreation of the 1960's golden age of advertizing.  The outstanding screenwriting plus ensemble cast, set direction, production design and costume design make this an art piece for television.
1563899426|3.0|Really loved the premise, (Classic Fairy Tales + Detective Noir) but I was taken out of the story quite a bit by inconsistent writing.  Many of the characters just did not resonate at all with me (The dialog wasn't good, but got a little better as it went).    I'm thinking this gets much better as it goes on as most friends who recommended it said this first one was the weakest.   The pencils were fairly good---though I thought the coloring could have been done better through out.     I'm off to check out the next trade.
0345455681|3.0|There is a lot of history here to be sure, but with the constantly changing characters it is difficult to connect with any of them.  Ever 100 pages or so, the author begins another period of London's history and with it naturally comes new characters.  You are never with a character long enough to really care.  I personally found the author's method of following seven (or more?) different families through history tedious.  I was constantly referring to the family trees that are provided to try to figure out who everyone was.  It was a book that you have to work at to enjoy.  I give it 3 stars for the vast amount of information that is covered - you WILL learn a lot, but can't give it any more than that due to the choppy feel of the story.  If you are reading for the history lesson alone, you will like it.  If you wanted a great story too, you may want to choose something that doesn't cover quite so much history in one book.
B0015OKWL2|2.0|I really looked forward to seeing Pacino and De Niro together. This story is a sad vehicle for their talents. It's a disappointment relative to the previous work of either actor. The \\"plot twist\\" is not suprising or meaningful. Overall, the film leaves you wondering what was the point???
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This is a truly quirky movie that is well produced and worth watching, but it's hard to know what you're left with when it's done. The characters ring fairly true, and I guess that's the biggest strength of the film. The glaring gap between what the father, Richard, tries to teach in his motivational course and his own behavior inspires cynicism. The character of Sheryl, the mother, is built on her conviction that they all must stay together and support each other no matter what, which I guess is a reasonable premise for a mother, though it was hard to see who she was beyond that. The grandfather plays a truly offensive character - watching someone snort cocaine and be smartass about it made me quite uncomfortable - though I guess that was the intent and there would have been no story without him. The most sympathetic characters for me were Frank, who has recently attempted suicide - he seems the most normal of the whole bunch - and Dwayne, a kid just trying to find his place in the world and grow up. I found the treatment of Olive's weight issue unconvincing - no overweight kid is unaware of how he or she looks and is judged by society, as Olive seemed to be before the very end of the film. Nor is it in the least plausible that Olive had no sense of the inappropriateness of her own performance - though again, that was part of the core idea of the film. The hypersexualized little beauty contest contenders at the end were truly creepy - creepy because of what they say about what attracts attention and rewards in our society, though some of their talent performances were impressive. They certainly did succeed in pointing up the dissonance between what we worship and what we are in everyday life.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie yet, it's worth it. But don't go into it expecting any answers or even a feeling of completion or closure - that's not what this one is about.
B001EO748M|5.0|The Tudors season 2 I think was far better than season one. Though both seasons were awesome. This season was more intense. Can't wait to see Season three airing on Showtime. Natalie Dormand as Anne Boleyn was gorgeous. I think she did a fantastic job as Queen Anne. And of course the ever handsome Jonathan Rhys Meyers, whom I have been a fan of for a long time. As King Henry the Eighth.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|The Prodigy is the world famous electronic music band with their own very particular sound. They are on the top of the game since the early nineties. They are not really quick in producing albums, \\"Invaders Must Die\\" is only their fifth studio album and it has been five year since their previous one called \\"Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned\\". Their previous album maybe was not that well  received and certainly not as successful as their third album \\"Fat of the Land\\" which topped the charts in many country. The style on Always Outnumbered was definitely different from what they made before, and even though I liked that album pretty much I also recognized it did not have that best possible sound that I learned to appreciate in the Prodigy's previous albums.    However, Invaders Must Die is a different piece of cake. People that were disappointed by the previous installment should definitely give this one a try and I think they will learn that the Prodigy had produced an album with terrific music full of energy that might be their best album yet. Yes, you read that right, THEIR BEST ALBUM YET! The album contains a set of very powerful and energetic songs that do have the typical Prodigy sound, yet there is quite some diversity in the type of songs. The only real criticism I have for this album is that it is so short (45 min)! Anyway, I cannot stress enough how good this album is, I personally can't just stop listening. Other acts like the Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim and Pendulum of course hold up quite well in their own right (I especially liked Pendulum's In Silico in that regard), however I think that the only group that really deserves the crown for being kings of Electronic Music is the Prodigy, especially with this album.    To go over the tracks: \\"Invaders Must Die\\", the opening track that has been offered as a free download on the Prodigy sound is really a great opener. It is a bit less complex that some typical other Prodigy Songs, but it is powerful and contains the right energy. \\"Omen\\", their first (real) single, contains some lyric oneliners from Keith, and will probably be a real a club hit. \\"Thunder\\" is a bit more laid back track, that has its share of complex typical Prodigy sound. Colours is one of my favorites, with some \\"atari\\" or \\"commodore\\" tunes. Maybe that doesn't sound attractive, but it really really works and sounds really great. \\"Take me to the Hospital\\" for me sounds a lot like the Prodigy sound for the nineties. It has a kind of \\"out of space\\" sound, but with a great beat. \\"Warrior Dance\\" also has a real nineties retro sound. But the Prodigy-sauce updates this nineties sounds and gives it the energy that makes it worth while. \\"Run With the Wolves\\" is my favorite song. It has some drums from famous Dave Grohl. But the best part is its melody that packs a lot of power with its great rave sound. \\"Omen Reprise\\" is a bit of strange track on the album as a sort of Remix of the earlier song on the same album. It still sounds good, but in my opion is the weakest track on the album. \\"The World on Fire\\" is a party track that is already used in their live sets for quite some time. I think this is probably the most energetic track on the album (which is quite a feat). \\"Piranha\\" has a nineties-house-sound over it, but mixed with drum and base and this typical complex Prodigy tune also gives this track the power that it needs. \\"Stand Up\\" is the most laid back track on the album, which has a Reggae sound over it. It is a good closer of the album, which gives you a happy feeling and even though it differs a bit from the rest of the tracks it doesn't feel out of place at all.    To summarize: \\"Invaders Must Die\\" is a great, great album that should be tried by everyone that somehow likes electronic music. I really do hope that the Prodigy will step up the pace of making new studio albums as the prospect of having to wait again for five years for such a great album is a bit hard to swallow for me.
0930289234|2.0|... are the 3 words that best describe \\"The Watchmen\\" by Alan Moore.  Normally, I would not scold a superhero comic for being \\"stupid\\" - they are not supposed to be high art - but I want to emphasize that this \\"graphic novel\\" has no excuse that I could discern for being as boring and ugly as it is.  I know some have praised this comic's \\"realism\\", and I have no idea what they mean, unless they are merely so cynical that they automatically associate \\"reality\\" with \\"boring and ugly\\".<br /><br />One idea here, apparently, is that if \\"costumed adventurers\\" were \\"real\\" they would be a collection of amoral psychos, misfits, sexual fetishists, rapists and murderers.  I can't see the logic behind this -- the traditional comic, with its mix of heroes and villains, seems far more \\"realistic\\" to my mind.  It would be far more logical to say that if \\"costumed adventurers\\" were real, they would wear costumes and go on adventures, because otherwise they would not be \\"costumed adventurers\\".  Not so here.  Instead, we are treated to a bunch of unpleasant characters who used to wear costumes, and may (possibly) have once attempted one or two adventures, but who do so no longer for various reasons, mainly because they have realized the idea of \\"costumed adventurers\\" never made any sense to begin with.<br /><br />I understand this was originally intended as a six issue series, but was then stretched out to twelve by means of plentiful padding.  It shows.<br /><br />Those who persevere through all the padding and dourly intoned cynical platitudes may ultimately find some sort of plot, centering on the efforts of \\"Rorschach\\", the only hero too psychotic to accept reality and retire, to investigate the murder of \\"the Comedian\\", a former associate.<br /><br />Rorschach eventually manages to lure two more associates, the \\"Nite Owl\\" and the \\"Silk Spectre\\", out of retirement.  Nite Owl is a Batman-type fellow, with a secret lair filled with lots of neat Owl-themed stuff.  Silk Spectre seems like her main function is to sleep with other characters, such as Nite Owl.  Comparatively speaking, both seem relatively decent.  But the reader tempted to identify with them as the story's heroes should not raise his hopes too high.<br /><br />In the course of their investigations, we also meet \\"Moloch\\" (a former arch-villain), \\"Ozymandias\\" (a tycoon who has made a fortune marketing his superhero persona), and \\"Dr. Manhattan\\" (an extremely annoying naked blue guy, with truly godlike powers, who does not adequately appreciate that no-one wants to see his penis).<br /><br />The events that unfold are highly implausible, but you will be so relieved that something is finally happening that you won't complain.  You will probably find the ending both surprising and shocking, and this may be enough to impress.  In the end you will be left scratching your head wondering what the author was trying to say.  No good answer is likely to occur to you.<br /><br />By the end, the only character for whom I retained any remote sympathy was Rorschach, and somehow, I am not at all sure that is quite what the author intended.like her main function is to sleep with other characters, such as Nite Owl.

B000P7V45S|5.0|The 1976 album \\"A Trick Of The Tail\\" showed Genesis could survive the departure of their charismatic frontman Peter Gabriel,with the now-quartet(Phil,Mike,Tony and Steve) displaying their musical and songwriting prowness on such numbers as the intense opener \\"Dance On A Volcano\\",the classical-like \\"Ripples\\",the \\"Kashmir\\"-ish \\"Sponk\\",the wistful epic \\"Mad Mad Moon\\" and the closing fusion-ish instrumental \\"Los Endos\\".This remixed/remastered stereo/5.1 DD/DTS sound on this CD/DVD edition is superb-Phil Collins's vocals and drums,which were buried in the old mix,are more upfront here, with the rest of the band sounding sharper and more crystal-clear than ever before.Some fussy audiophiles might complain that the new mix is \\"too loud\\",but then again,they complained about how bad the last CD issues from the 80's and 90's were(and I was one of them!).The DVD also includes a awesome \\"Genesis In Concert 1976\\",great interviews with the band members, and three music videos,the noteworthy one being the amusing \\"Robbery,Assault And Battery\\",which shows a humorous side to the group that would serve them well in their future.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|After St. Anger I did not expect much at all from Metallica. It was kind of like when Van Halen made the irreversible down hill slide. It became comical to watch members come and go. With Jason being gone it had a similar feel to their last album. Fortunately I think such a fate has been avoided with this effort.    The production values are back to what they should be. The songs are written well enough to enter the pantheon of Metallica-dome. Though it must be said this album cannot compare to \\"older\\" Metallica. I would take Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, or even ...And Justice For All over this any day. But at least this may persuade stations to play something besides Enter Sandman an extra thirty times per day.    I am postive towards their different shifts in the musical spectrum. I feel if Load and Reload were self-edited and joined as one album it would have been a really good album. (Think Devil's Dance and The Outlaw Torn with such lame tracks like Ronnie thrown away instead). That is only to say I'm not an unreasonable Metallica fan. So for people with less extreme tastes on the subject this may help you make a decision.    The album is good, not great. Worth owning, but know in advance there has been controversy with clipping issues. It's not your speakers blowing up; the effect was intentional and not decided upon by the band at all. Nevertheless it's still a good time.

0553579908|5.0|This is every bit as good as the first book. I love how Martin can make you hate his characters in one chapter and find yourself pulling for them in the next chapter. Every fantasy fan should treat themselves to this excellent series. The only down side is that only four of the books in this series are complete so far and Mr. Martin writes VERY slowly. I must say though that his quality is worth the wait. This really deserves it's five star rating.

Do yourself a favor and gobble up the entire series.
0792833279|5.0|Elmore Leonard knows Hollywood, but his insider's view of the movie business is the least of the appeal of this movie. John Travolta is Chili Palmer, a loan shark who comes to LA to collect a debt. The large gag is that Chili's utterly amoral, but brilliantly crafted amorality is a perfect pre-adaption to life in movieland. He moves almost seamelessly from the world of small-time hoodlery to big-time movie producing.<br />The plot makes its way through this metaphor with lots of action, sly double-crossing and grotesque thugs to spare.<br />But the large gag is one that you enjoy on reflection, after the movie is over. The little gags revolve around Leonard's wit (imagine: a movie with witty dialog!)and some imaginative casting. Danny deVito as Tinseltown's most sought-after leading man, Rene Russo as the delicious B-movie actress, Gene Hackman as the nervous, marginal producer. Travolta seems born for the role, he is by turns, hot, bland and violent and holds us in suspense as we wait to see who Chili will be next.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of [[ASIN:1601641915 The Short Course in Beer]]
0553582038|5.0|Did I like this as much as the first three books? No. Did I think it was still an excellent book? Yes. I do understand how people could be frustrated that their favorite characters from past books were not covered as much as they would like. When you have to wait so long for the next book of the series to come out you miss your favorite characters. I wish Martin wrote much faster and I would of liked to see more of the old characters but I think introducing us to all these new characters will pay off in the end. One thing you really can count on George for is the quality of his work. I rate this book 4.5 stars and I am really looking forward to A Dance With Dragons.
B00003CXXP|4.0|A.I., Artificial Intelligence / B00003CXXP<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />When I rented this movie, I did not know what to expect, but I knew to expect \\"something weird\\", given the science fiction nature of the premise and the previous work of the talent involved. What I did not expect, however, was for this movie to be as moving as it was.<br /><br />A.I. tells the story of a prototype robot, fashioned to look and act and even love as an innocent young child would. The premise is laid out flatly in the opening scene - the easy part is making a robot who can love a human, the hard part is finding a human who will love, truly love, the robot in return. When the young \\"boy\\" is cast aside from his human parents in a scene that is at least as much reminiscent of The Velveteen Rabbit as it is of Pinocchio, he wanders a harsh, cruel world searching for something - anything - that can make him a \\"real boy\\" and, he hopes, cause his 'mommy' to love him as much as she loves her \\"real son\\".<br /><br />Our protagonist was programmed to think and behave as a child, and he does. With childlike innocence, he seizes fiercely on the idea of a \\"blue fairy\\" from his Pinocchio book who can turn him real. He stumbles through a world of backlashing crowds who publicly roast robots on stage in an attempt to return to something real; he charms disenchanted older robots who help him as much as they are able. When a \\"pleasure model\\" robot tells him, compassionately, that his 'mommy' \\"loves what you do for her, as my customers love what I do for them, but she doesn't love YOU\\", he resists, rebels against this unfortunate truth. He is willing to search until the end of time to find his mommy and, in doing so, demonstrates a depth of childlike love that she simply does not deserve and yet he gives anyway.<br /><br />I deeply enjoyed this movie for its depictions of humanity. For the conflicted position of a father who is caught between his family's safety and a 'mere' constructed robot. For the casual cruelty of a young human boy who must reconcile his damaged body and the 'replacement' boy his mother loved in his absence. For the conflicted emotions of a mother who is loved by her family, but who must make sacrifices for each of these loves. For the hatred of the raging crowd, composed of varied individuals with varying emotions - sadism for some, yes, but with a willingness to halt the destruction for a single child, even if it is 'merely' a robot child. And for the humanity of childlike love, expressed paradoxically through a small robot.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollhe casual cruelty of a young human boy who must reconcile his damaged body and the 'replacement' boy his mother loved in his absence.

Even if you do not like King, there is no doubt he has beeen successful and though he may sometimes be dismissed as a horror writer, he has done so many things that are very good that it is worthwhile to see his process and thoughts.    By the time you are done you have a new appeciation for him and you feel like you can try to write something if you wanted.

All the main characters and the actors that portray them are wonderful in their respective roles. Each one brings a uniqueness to their character and the result is hysterical. I never miss watching an episode on Mon. nights and I have so enjoyed having the First Season DVD and plan on buying each season as it comes out. If you have watched the show and liked it then you might want to purchase the DVDs so you can watch the episodes over and over again.

0307276902|3.0|Even if the story hadn't been debunked, and I hadn't known it before reading, the characters, and simply the events would have spelled out fiction. Still, it was a basically almost, punk storyline: rebellion, addiction, bad characters who are turned into the stars, a troubled romance... all the elements of a basic noir or punk story. The whole, i can beat addiction by myself was a little annoying, that's not how addicts are. The sentence and dialog structuring was a little annoying at times too- okay, so basically its all in his head, and addiction takes away all that stuff, or something like that. Still, again, it was basically a punk story so I liked it.

0930289234|5.0|What to say about this excellent work that hasn't been said before? This book covers so many layers of humanity and issues- it is THE comic book to read.<br /><br />Still, after reading alot of the discussions on this site about the book, I gravitated towards the negative reviews to see why people would not appreciate the work, because in my opinion this is a piece of work.<br /><br />Rather than detract or defend the criticism, I feel like tossing my own two-cents into the mix over analysis and deconstruction, seeming as this is pretty much the point of Watchmen, and stating in my humble opinion why I feel that this book deserves the praise and adulations.<br /><br />First and foremost, the point-of-view of the book is Moores; and this seems to be the point of reference for contention that most people have by way of the novels nihilistic construction. Through Moores vision is the world constructed, and this in and of itself is why the novel is good from its start- good storytellers are able to infuse in their works with their views, and create an atmosphere that resonates completely within the scope of that outlook. In this, the entirety of the series does, whether you appreciate the atmosphere, bleak and seemingly apocalyptic, or not.<br /><br />Still, the point of this entire series is a question.The basic question presented by Moore is Why do we, and should we venerate the concept of Hero[ yet 'Hero' here is more broadly to be taken than simply superhero, indeed it is all 'authoritarian' or even, 'moral' personas]? It would have been boilerplate material if an author had chosen to present a single hero, or superhero, doing daring-do's and who in secret committed acts that questions the outcomes of his actions. What Moore did was to dissect the concept of hero into discrete, manageable constructs- that is, different characters, each possessing different driving forces as to their vocation of superheroing. The extremes of each of these characters are the glaring extremes of the traits and qualities of heroes- courageous, loyal, champion, etc. However, by way of these various characters, he was also able to seep into each the reasons behind these virtuous markers- the dual natures of and driving factors of these lauded traits. For example, the vigilante, who can and is romanticized as a rule-breaker to set things right, is himself a victim of wrongs, poisoning all his actions with the question of redemption. So too are the characters who possess great insight into logic and rationalization- to what extremes of logic and analysis should and do we choose to accept? Or even the more humble, thrill-seeking, adventurous, and amorous natures that drive a hero towards gadgetry and costume capering- these affairs of passion and chivalry are at their core poisoned by the very natures of what it means to be human and the need to break the mold of the ordinary and mundane. Yet, in each character, mundane and commonplace seems to be the eternal web from which they are all caught in, and as humans, they will inevitably remain. It is this, the breakdown of the motivations of characters, of the worship of supposed heroes', and veneration of traits seemingly extraordinary that Moore begs us to question.<br /><br />What's more, each character is infused with different aspects of macro-societal concepts as well. Whether it is the death of bravado and a steady decline of a nation, or the emergence of the worship of science, and its subsequent susceptibility to indifference, or its longing for simpler ways, or attempts to stare into the abyss, despite the chaos that may commence- all of it is harmonized and told against a critique of society with such concepts as state, science, and the individual.<br /><br />In this then, each character is fighting a battle both on a personal level, and a societal level.<br /><br />As for the artwork, it blends well with the story itself, gritty and straightforward.<br /><br />I don't necessarily agree with allthat Moore posits about the nature of humanity and the brutal outlook of action, and pathos that he paints. The ending itself however, I believe is Moores attempt at recognizing this fact; that in the end, each decision and outlook, is driven not by factors which we are 100% in sync with, and have control over- that is life. Still, like any other work of fiction, the point is to raise questions about our understanding of our own motivations and perspectives. In this Moore achieves resounding success.<br /><br />As to the fact that this was not a standard spandex-daring-do \\"comic-book\\"-  there is no question. To compare it to any such work is similar to comparing a coloring book to a photography book. Same design, completely different purpose. If you had expected that and were disappointed to find something much different, that is a shame, however, there are plenty of other such story's like that out there.that Moore posits about the nature of humanity and the brutal outlook of action, and pathos that he paints.

B00180R06I|4.0|Carl Dreyer, director of the landmark \\"Passion of Joan of Arc,\\" tried his hand at atmospheric horror with 1932's \\"Vampyr\\" and the result is an arresting tone poem. Visionary filmmakers are particularly well-suited to the horror genre. Like the folklore from which so many spine-tingling tales spring, stories involving the supernatural, the unconscious and the specter of Death tap into the primordial fears and nightmares of the viewer. A great director can cast a hypnotic spell on his audience -- lulling you into a deep-dream state where images impact on a primal level. Kubrick's \\"The Shining,\\" Murnau's \\"Nosferatu,\\" Hitchcock's \\"Psycho,\\" Polanski's \\"Rosemary's Baby,\\" Dario Argento's \\"Suspiria,\\" and Michael Powell's \\"Peeping Tom\\" are just a few of the many classic horror films elevated by the hallucinogenic power of a sibylline storyteller.<br /><br />Add \\"Vampyr\\" to that pantheon. Although \\"Vampyr\\" lacks Passion's claustrophobic intensity and narrative power (most movies do), it retains Dreyer's characteristically artful camera work and painter's eye for composition. His images are endlessly inventive. Early on, he sets an eerie aura with portents of doom--a peasant holding a scythe, tolling a bell, shadows moving without bodies, a dug-out grave. The simple story of a wanderer under a perhaps hypnogogic spell takes on mythic proportions when given Dreyer's dramatic and symbolist-oriented treatment. The rest of the film plays out like a fever dream--simple, lucid, yet chock-full of foreboding signs and visions. At one point, Dreyer even employs what I'll call a \\"coffin-cam\\" -- shots from the viewpoint of a man trapped inside his own coffin, looking up at the trees and buildings as he's carried to his grave.<br /><br />That's just one of the many indelible images in this haunting film. Dreyer understood, perhaps instinctively, that films can create a dream-like state-of-mind, and Dreyer's have a hallucinatory power. Someone said of him (with regards to \\"Passion of Joan of Arc\\" and I'm paraphrasing) that he directed like an alien who had never seen a movie before. Perhaps that's why he's still ahead of his time.'m paraphrasing) that he directed like an alien who had never seen a movie before. Perhaps that's why he's still ahead of his time.

B000MZHW40|4.0|For a movie that wears its social conscience on its sleeve, \\"Blood Diamond\\" never neglects little things like craftsmanship or genuinely sympathetic characters. Close filmic cousins would be \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" or \\"Casablanca\\" -- well-crafted stories in an exotic setting about characters in spiritual as well as physical crisis, where the tension between personal gain and the larger good is especially taut. I loved this movie for its heartfelt ambition, its sincerity, its intelligence, and for its revelatory performance by Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />I don't mention \\"Treasure\\" or \\"Casablanca\\" gratuitously. \\"Blood Diamond's\\" protagonist, diamond-smuggler Danny Archer (DiCaprio), would feel right at home at Rick's Cafe. A white South African survivor of apartheid, he's a seen-it-all cynic looking out for Number One; a Soldier of Fortune waiting for his one-way ticket off the Continent. That ticket arrives in the unlikely form of a modest, moral fisherman, Solomon Vandy (the always magnetic Djimon Hounsou), who has discovered a much-coveted \\"Blood Diamond\\" after being enslaved by mercenaries.<br /><br />Danny and Solomon make an odd couple (with echoes of \\"The Defiant Ones\\") as they quest for the diamond that promises to free each from their respective captivity. Danny wants to cash in and check out. Solomon wants his family back. Will the Blood Diamond bring them what they seek? Their quest, and the moral questions the quest raises, are reminiscent of a John Huston film; whether \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" or \\"The Man Who Would Be King,\\" Huston was obsessed with \\"the quest,\\" that search for Life's meaning as embodied by some material aim: whether gold (\\"Treasure\\") or the \\"stuff that dreams are made of\\" (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\").<br /><br />The search for paradise in war-ravaged Africa results in cynicism and despair. Danny says, in a rare moment of vulnerability, \\"Sometimes I wonder... will God ever forgive us for what we've done to each other? Then I look around and I realize... God left this place a long time ago.\\" The point of \\"Blood Diamond\\" isn't that God is absent, but that God is present in the small acts of charity, the small moments of genuine humanity shared between the hopeless and the despairing. A character says, \\"A moment of love, even in a bad man, can give meaning to a life. None of us knows whose path will lead us to God.\\"<br /><br />None of us indeed. Do we fight for Good or Evil? Do we engender Misery or Hope? \\"Blood Diamond\\" reinforces the idea that each person has a choice, a free will, to do good or ill, to make right or wrong choices. Danny Archer and his character arc is the key to appreciating what is ultimately uplifting and life-affirming about this movie. I've always respected DiCaprio's acting chops, but his performance here is a masterful synthesis of all the talent and range he's shown elsewhere. By turns, Archer is devilishly charming, terrifyingly threatening, scrappily street-wise, and woundingly vulnerable. DiCaprio navigates these deep waters with an impressive lack of showboating. It's a fearless, gripping performance, and Leo deserved his Oscar nod. Slowly, by subtle degrees, he convinces you that Archer's hard shell thinly disguises someone desperate for redemption..

B000ZN802W|4.0|\\"Into the Wild\\" is based on the true story of Chris McCandless, a college graduate from a posh family who abandoned his privileged existence for a life of hitchhiking, living off the land, and go-with-the-flow spirituality. He sent his life savings to OxFam, scissored his credit cards, and burnt his identification. He's reborn as \\"Alexander Supertramp;\\" lone wanderer of the American landscape.<br /><br />Chris is an intelligent and earnest young man. Sick of modern civilization and its crass materialism, he finds inspiration in the pages of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Jack London. The holy grail of his quest for spiritual enlightenment is Alaska, a place where he can be alone to \\"just be out there in it. You know, big mountains, rivers, sky, game. Just be out there in it, you know? In the wild.\\"<br /><br />Sean Penn's lyrical and intimate directing style owes a debt to Terrence Malick, who directed Penn in \\"The Thin Red Line.\\" The lush images of sunsets, soaring birds, and falling water seem to reinforce Chris' Romantic vision of man's spiritual relationship to nature -- the movie even opens with a quote from Lord Byron -- and when Chris says, \\"You don't need human relationships to be happy, God has placed it all around us,\\" you wonder if Penn perhaps endorses this somewhat reductive view of life.<br /><br />Then something happens in the second half of the film that casts Chris's journey in a new light. In the final chapter of the movie Chris meets Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook), a retired Army man, recovered alcoholic, and devout man-of-faith. They develop a quiet, unassuming friendship based on sympathy and understanding. Ron, having heard of Chris' family troubles, tells him: \\"When you forgive, you love. And when you love, God's light shines upon you.\\" This chapter of the film is titled: \\"The Getting of Wisdom.\\"<br /><br />The tragedy of \\"Into the Wild\\" is that Chris refuses the grace offered through the relationship with Ron, whose life of hope and love is the true holy grail of spiritual enlightenment, not Alaska. Ron invites Chris to stay with him as an adopted grandson, but Chris, in his restlessness, feels compelled to continue on his way to the vast emptiness of Alaska.<br /><br />But Ron's vision of life as forgiveness and love returns to Chris in his loneliness and isolation in the wilderness. In his mind's eye, Chris sees his joyful return to his family, embracing them in the life-giving love made possible by forgiveness. In his mind, he asks them: \\"What if I were smiling and running into your arms? Would you see then what I see now?\\"<br /><br />There he remains, sick and starving in the Alaskan wilderness, \\"trapped in the wild\\" as he writes in his journal. His final insight is scribbled into the margins of his tattered copy of Tolstoy: \\"Happiness is only real when shared.\\"ot Alaska.

Now I see why people rave about it, it's a classic  and I give the book a perfect 10 STARS if I could!    But it's also DATED IMO.    There I said it.      There are other African writers who are just as brilliant   but their work is more up to date and has moved me a lot  more than is.  Is that because I'm biracial and female?  I don't know.    I was blown away when I read Kola Boof's autobiography  Diary of a Lost Girl, she is Sudanese and goes way beyond  Osama Bin Laden in her memoirs as she explored black identity  in ways I've never seen African/black identity explored.  Not to mention the vaginal cutting and how its effected her  life.  I read her autobiography in one day and then read her  novel \\"Flesh and the Devil\\" and those two modern African books  have changed my life profoundly.    So while I do give \\"Things Fall Apart\\" 10 stars, I am wondering  when the University Requirement will take notice of other stronger  works that IMO are more relevant and challenging than this one.

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|My comments are going to address the film itself (just as my 5-star rating is for the movie, not the DVD transfer), since many other smart and observant reviewers have pointed out the failings of Warner Brothers' shoddy treatment of Barry Lyndon on DVD. I absolutely urge any fan of poetic cinema or Stanley Kubrick to invest in a copy of this movie, but better to wait for a beautiful transfer of one of the most beautifully photographed films ever made.<br /><br />As for the film... A hipster friend once told me Kubrick was his favorite director. I asked him if he liked \\"Barry Lyndon.\\" \\"Barry what?\\" was the answer, confirming my suspicion that \\"Lyndon\\" is an underrated work even among Kubrick devotees. I can understand. Despite being a period-piece based on a picturesque adventure novel, Lyndon is as aggressively experimental as Kubrick's previous film, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" and does not reward the passive or impatient viewer.<br /><br />Thwarted in his desire to film a Napoleon biopic, Kubrick turned to William Makepeace Thackeray for inspiration and the result is an arrestingly beautiful, strangely haunting, and thoroughly original work of cinematic art. In two parts separated by an intermission, Barry Lyndon follows the rise and fall of one Redmond Barry, an 18th century Irishman whose good looks, ingratiating manners, talent for fighting, and cutthroat ambition mark him for something \\"greater\\" in life than tending farms. During the course of the narrative, Redmond duels an Englishman, joins the regiment afoot, deserts, gets dragooned into the Prussian army, becomes a Prussian spy, escapes again, takes up the profession of gambling, travels the Continent in the company of a Chevalier, and pursues a nobleman's wife.<br /><br />And that's just the first part. Sounds like an exciting romp, doesn't it? Er, actually -- it's not. For all its visual pomp and splendor, \\"Barry Lyndon\\" remains one of the strangest, most idiosyncratic films I've ever seen. Ask almost anyone who has seen the movie (a paltry number to begin with) and most will tell you that \\"Barry Lyndon\\" is, in a word, boring. I can only account for my own experience, but the effect for me is more mesmerizing than yawn-inducing. Kubrick's mastery of the film medium is such that he recklessly breaks all rules of movie storytelling and yet I'm hypnotized by the painterly images and evocative classical soundtrack.<br /><br />\\"Lyndon\\" is an embarrassment of visual riches, from the lush green landscape of Ireland to the candle-lit interiors of European courts and palaces. Virtually every shot of the movie could be framed and mounted on the wall. \\"Barry Lyndon\\" belongs on a shortlist of the most physically ravishing films ever made and is worth seeing for that reason alone. It's pure cinema, distilled to a gorgeous interplay of sight and sound.<br /><br />Kubrick stretches film time to the breaking point, collapsing months and years into a few shots and then drawing out fleeting moments for a seeming eternity. Redmond's seduction of Lady Lyndon, for example, is a wordless sequence that travels from the gaming table to an outside veranda in a breathtaking ballet of glances, meaningful expressions, unspoken emotions, and quiet gestures. Social ritual fascinates Kubrick, and much of the drama of the story stems from the tension between violent passion and society's restrictive formalities.<br /><br />Yet it's not all filmic experimentation and weighty themes. \\"Barry Lyndon's\\" early, Ireland-set scenes feature stunning scenery and a lovely, lilting theme composed by that great Celtic band, the Chieftains. The humor is dry-as-dust and dark-as-midnight, the kind of humor Kubrick specializes in (remember a little satire called Dr. Strangelove?), as in the delightful exchange between Redmond and Captain Feeny, one of the most courtly-mannered robbers one is likely to encounter. As for Kubrick's purportedly \\"clinical\\" absence of emotion, there's a scene towards the end of the film between Redmond and his ailing young son that is emotionally devastating.<br /><br />Ryan O'Neal, never known as a great actor (to put it mildly), is nevertheless perfectly suited to the part of the rogue-ish Redmond Barry. As in the aforementioned scene with his son, O'Neal digs deep to give a powerful, convincing performance that maintains a high quality over the course of the movie's 3-hour running time. Though his Lucky Charms Irish accent comes and goes, O'Neal captures an essential innocence and sweetness to the character that allows the audience to keep with him through thick-and-thin. His social climbing doesn't seem so much the result of a Machiavellian plan as the result of spur-of-the-moment opportunism. In the climax of the film, a stunning duel that takes place in an abandoned barn, Redmond makes a choice that demonstrates the distance he's traveled from his first impetuous duel with the Englishman. In that moment, Redmond deserves the name of hero. O'Neal himself must have known Barry Lyndon was a career highlight: he named his son Redmond.<br /><br />Because of its slow pace and storytelling idiosyncracies, I'm always hesitant to recommend \\"Barry Lyndon.\\" Yet I can't help myself. Though not for all tastes, \\"Lyndon\\" is that rare cinematic beast: a truly personal expression by a formidable artist. Its rewards are rich and abiding.otionally devastating.

B00007KLJJ|5.0|This film is extremely well-directed and the acting is uniformly good. Heath Ledger commands the screen and there is evidence of early acting mastery.

B0011HOEY4|3.0|American Gangster. Emphasis on \\"American.\\" This is a Horatio Alger story, Harlem-style -- the rise and fall of a drug lord who bests the competition with old-fashioned MBA tactics: a product twice as good at half the price.<br /><br />The entrepreneur is Frank Lucas, played by wolfishly lean-and-hungry Denzel Washington. His product is \\"Blue Magic,\\" heroin smuggled to the States from Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War years. In the august American tradition, Lucas manifests his destiny with a little get-up-and-go, innovative marketing/distribution tactics, name-branding, and ends by establishing a business monolith on the streets of New York.<br /><br />\\"American Gangster\\" would make an interesting (if near unwatchable) double-feature with \\"There Will Be Blood.\\" Both are gruesome, indicting explorations of the American Dream skewed, twisted, and transformed into the American Nightmare. Both examine the Darwinian nature (\\"red in tooth and claw\\") of American capitalism -- kill or be killed, survival-of-the-fittest, last man standing. Both feature repulsive yet hypnotic antiheroes whose ambition is matched by their amorality. Both movies are long, violent, and bludgeoning.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Gangster\\" lacks \\"Blood's\\" obsessive focus on its main character. Washington is magnetic as the cool but volatile Lucas, while his costar Russell Crowe gets stuck with the perfunctory part of dogged detective on Lucas' trail, the one good cop in a corrupt city. This parallel storyline adds unnecessary poundage to an already flabby script, especially the sub-subplot involving divorce proceedings with the requisitely long-suffering wife. (Perhaps Denzel is getting revenge. Remember a movie from years back called \\"Virtuosity\\"? Probably not, but if you do it's only because a young, relatively unknown Aussie named Russell Crowe stole the movie blind from its supposed star, Denzel. Now it's Denzel's turn to slow-burn as the bad guy.)<br /><br />The viewer has to wade through a whole lot of muck to arrive at the big showdown between Russell and Denzel (I mean, Richie Roberts and Frank Lucas). It's almost worth the wait. Their scenes together have a wit and energy the rest of movie lacks. There's even a suggestion of redemption in the Lucas character who, when Richie asks him if he'd like a drink, answers with a grin, \\"Holy water.\\" It's too little, too late.

B000OHZJKK|4.0|Pop rock at its late 70's heights shows a thinking man's Bruce Springsteen continuing to harness amazing energy and tight interplay out of proportion to many of his peers, furthering an already torrential amount of praise only after this sophomore release. Undeniably rock-solid, but only a handful of  entries sound entirely brilliant.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|I must admit that I throughly enjoyed this book from the beginning to the end, and that it is worth any avid reader's money. I downloaded it to my Kindle after reading several reviews and I managed to read the entire book within a very short time span. The characters are interesting and the plot moves along very quickly. I recommend this book to anyone who would like to escape to an interesting island that has a powerful history and beautiful scenery.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|From the first scene, you know this isn't going to be your regular TV cop drama.  Hard hitting, combat style filming, harsh street dialog make The Shield the best show out there.  If you watch the first season, you will be hooked into the whole series.  DVD quality is great and rewatching the episodes with commentary by the director and actors really gives insight as to the vision they all had.  A must see!

B000HC2LI0|4.0|I think that this is a wonderful product. The disks came in perfect packaging and the cases are good. There was although a problem. The episode guide was very nice in finding specific episodes fast and easily.     One big letdown was the fact that seasons 1-5 have English, Spanish, and French subtitles, but seasons 6-7 did not. I have trouble hearing some words in the show so until season 6 the subtitles were a lifesaver. I in fact stopped watching the DVD's to watch TV reruns which  did have subtitles. I think if you liked the show or want to try a new show (and like politics!) this is the best show to watch.     To be honest the pilot scrip was just a big waste of paper. I cannot possibly imagine what you could do with the script in typewriter font.    I would buy this again but the subtitle problem was big as was the waste of pilot script. If you are a fan of the show this is one to buy.

0143036424|4.0|Aging Wyoming sheriff Walt Longmire has been phoning it in ever since his wife died a couple of years ago. But when the suspects in an old rape case start turning up dead, Walt suspects that a revenge killer is on the loose. Can he stop the person? Should he? And while he's at it, should he take another chance on love?<br /><br />This book is better than the description makes it sound, because Johnson is a very good writer. I would not call this book a page-turner, though it does have its exciting moments. It is more reflective than that and looks deeper into the characters and the land. I especially liked the relationship between Walt and his friend Henry Standing Bear and the three-dimensional portrayal of the Indians. Johnson really takes the time to set up a fully-realized and interesting world.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I criticized a book for having too many literary allusions! Maybe we should give Johnson a medal instead. His erudition is impressive, but a few of the literary puns and quips **might** have been left on the cutting room floor. I have to admit I was a little disappointed in the conventional \\"Freudian\\" motivations that ended up solving the mystery, which didn't seem to go with the thoughtful and somewhat unorthodox path we'd taken so far.<br /><br />The Cold Dish is Johnson's first book, and I plan to seek out the others. Fans of CJ Box should check this out as well.<br /><br />Reviewer: Liz Clare, co-author of the historical novel \\"To the Ends of the Earth: The Last Journey of Lewis and Clark\\"

B00006AG5N|5.0|I saw Elvis in concert the month before he died. Even if you never saw him, you understand what made him so popular, even with people who never really liked rock and roll. He wasn't called the King for nothing. No matter what your taste in music, you are bound to find some songs you like here, and you have probably heard most, if not all of these songs, before. You can see the progression of style as you move from Hound Dog to Way Down. These recordings are the originals which have been remastered, and, lucky for us, we get crystal clear sound on recordings that were made back in the 1950s.<br /><br />There might be a better deal out there, but you won't regret purchasing this collection. When you hear Elvis sing Good Luck Charm, you will realize that some good luck has rubbed off on you from all the enjoyment you are getting from listening to these songs.
031606792X|3.0|The fourth and final book in the Twilight Saga. I loved the book for maybe the first quarter. Then it went all sci-fi and I had to keep myself from throwing the book across the room. What the crap happened? I sped read the book like New Moon thinking the good part was going to come. It didn't. Don't get me wrong there were highlights. Like when Bella finally became a vampire. Like when they FINALLY made love, both as Bella a human and vampire. Like when Bella hugged Edward for the first time after being changed and he said 'Ow'. The romance was gone in this book. I longed so much for the love that oozed out of the first three books, and felt like my blazing heart had a bucket of sand thrown on it. I wanted Edward to change Bella the right way. The vampire way. It was a very good book, but should not have been a Twilight book. As I finally came upon the last chapter of the 'Happy' ending, I was disappointed to see other characters beside Edward and Bella. There should have been at least 50 pages dedicated to their literal undying love to each other. When I closed the book, I was both ecstatic and dead inside. So happy they were finally together forever , yet missing that FIRE that had so deeply consumed me in the first 3 books.
B00005R23S|5.0|I love this NYC Concert by Bruce and the E Street Band. It is a 2 disk set and it really showcases what a Springsteen show is like. Although, to get the full effect, I recommend you see him LIVE. You will not be disappointed!
B000VPUIA6|2.0|I bought this set for my Mom who is a big Beatles fan and she really wasn't impressed.  There's a lot of 'memorabilia' type stuff, but she said the movie really isn't very good, and she'd much rather just listen to the music than watch the movie or read the song notes, or look at pictures of them.  If you're big into collectibles, and memorabilia, this is definitely for you, just wasn't for my Mom, and I wasn't too impressed either.
1932907009|5.0|I have read 4 books on screenwriting, including Syd Field's, which is very good, and this is by far the best. An aspiring screenwriter would be unfortunate to NOT read this fine book. Blake Snyder really tells you how to write a screenplay, because it is, after all, a craft as well as an art. He gives specific recommendations, and thoroughly explains why something should be done the way he says it should. And he's right. This book will save you months and years of aimless floundering. And he makes the journey enjoyable! I absolutely loved this book. I have even re-read it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B001CC7PP8|5.0|I absolutely just love this movie ! This is one of the best horror movies of all time, and Hitchcock said he did it as a joke. This was his first horror movie, a huge departure from his crime & suspense drama's. Never has one scene caused so much attention and inspired all the slashers you see today. The most iconic scene ever is the shower scene,bar none. Nothing like this had ever been shown, a man who dresses as a woman due to a mother complex kills people who arouse him, and those who try to catch the killer. Anthony Perkins was typecast forever for his role of Norman Bates. Janet Leigh became an icon who refused to let her daughter watch this,of course that is Jamie Lee Curtis, who went on to star in Halloween. John Gavin is Sam Loomis, where else did you hear this name - why Halloween of course - Donald Pleasence - he is Dr. Sam Loomis - hmm.<br />This movie broke new grounds for horror suspense and even as Janet Leigh walking around in her under garments. This was Hitch's most serious horror so he appeared early (as he usually does in his films) but this movie was more subtle since this movie was not to contain any inside jokes. The music is fantastic, parts of it show up in Friday the 13th, Re-Animator,etc.<br />If you have never seen this movie, you really really must see this. A brilliant movie, in black and white, to show the grittiness of the picture. ULTRA HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.<br />The DVD that I have is the new book shaped case with all sorts of bonus features which to me are just fantastic. A lot of people still like the collectors edition, or the box set, or what have you. I went for the Legacy and I am quite happy with the transfer, features,etc. A double dip that to me was worth it.
B000001DWG|4.0|As I think back on all of the musical talent of the Seatlle Sound in the early nineties. I can only ponder on what would have been if the drug of choice, heroin hadn't taken so many of them, especially the vocalists of that era, Layne Staley, Kurt Cobain and particularly Andrew wood.  Although, Malfunkshun was a great band, in which Andrew Woods vocal talents began to gain noteriety, this album truly defines him as a lead singer.   I believe that if Andrew Wood hadn't been taken so early in life, he would have been a mega-star and Mother Love Bone would have been mentioned along w/the great bands of that era such as; Soundgarden, Nirvana, Temple of the Dog, The Mudhoneys, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam etc.  Highly recommend if you want to listen to Hardcore, Blues and Anthem Metal combined rock n' roll.   In my humble opinion one of the best eras in rock n' roll history.    Enjoy!!!    Billy G-Drive

0930289234|4.0|I've got to tread lightly here and not offend Watchmen fans, but it wasn't my favorite.<br /><br />Parts are very dark, violence, rape, gruesome in parts. The writing while great, was dark and a slightly over the top. Still, it's the only graphic novel to win a Hugo award. The art didn't grab me at first but as I read the art seemed better and better. It's amazing the writer and artist could work so well together.<br /><br />The graphic novel is very detailed and takes a lot of work to read. It takes about as long to read as a long book. You really get your money's worth.<br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed it more had I read it when it was first published. For all the people who read it in the 1980's I'm sure it was very powerful then, but I doubt after all these years of books, movies, comics, and science fiction it could have the same impact today. For example some movies don't stand the test of time as well as others.<br /><br />Definitely going to see the movie. Graphic novel, 4 out of 5 stars!

0143036556|5.0|[[ASIN:0143036556 Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]<br />Jared Diamond is a treasure, one of a select group of practicing scientists (others would include Steven Pinker, Richard Dawkins, Brian Greene, and the late Stephen Jay Gould) who can synthesize otherwise dry or dense findings from the academic monographs into informative and entertaining narratives for general readers.  His Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies (W.W. Norton & Company, 1997) stands as one of the most important works of nonfiction published in the past few decades - it won a Pulitzer Prize, among other honors.  There he built a persuasive case for the geographic and biologic determinants of the success (or lack thereof) of civilizations.  He sought to boost history as a \\"science,\\" though one whose methods necessarily differ from the non-historical sciences such as physics and chemistry.<br /><br />Diamond is a true polymath.  He trained as a physiologist and taught at the UCLA medical school, has conducted extensive field work in ornithology, is now a professor of geography and physiology at UCLA, serves as an esteemed advisor on conservation practices, and has received such awards as the Lewis Thomas Prize honoring the \\"Scientist as Poet.\\"  In Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed, he applies his multiple talents to examine the flip side of the big question he raised in Guns, Germs, and Steel.  In the earlier book he emphasized the factors that contributed to the triumph of certain civilizations over others.  In Collapse he focuses primarily (although not exclusively) on civilizations that failed.  It is another Diamond jewel, though not quite so glimmering as its predecessor.<br /><br />Collapse consists of a series of accounts assessing both certain modern societies - Montana, Rwanda, The Dominican Republic and Haiti, China, and Australia - and several societies from the past - Easter Island, Pitcairn and Henderson Islands, the Anasazi, the Mayans, Norse Greenland, New Guinea highlanders, and others.  Most of the historical selections represent failures, but some are included to present contrasts or to illustrate the possibly pivotal importance of environmental choices contemporary societies now face.<br /><br />Diamond writes that a more descriptive full title for Collapse would be \\"Societal collapses involving an environmental component, and in some cases also contributions of climate change, hostile neighbors, and trade partners, plus questions of societal responses.\\"  These are the five factors he chose to apply in evaluating why most of his selected societies failed.<br /><br />Diamond aims for big conclusions based on comparisons across his cases, but each chapter holds interest on its own.  For example, one would not expect to find a disquisition on packrat middens especially fascinating, but Diamond makes it so.  These middens - ball-shaped deposits that were built by small rodents and preserved over hundreds of years, containing sticks, plant fragments, mammal dung, food remains, discarded bones, and the rats' own feces and urine - can tell us a great deal of value about Anasazi history in the American Southwest.  For the Anasazi and each of his other selected historical cases Diamond relies extensively on archeological studies applying methods both painstakingly detailed and sophisticated, such as those used to analyze the middens.  If you did not know before what a palynologist does, for instance, you will after reading Collapse (hint: it might make some people sneeze).  Although the chapters are built largely on the findings of highly specialized studies, Diamond's narratives convey a sense of contemporary presence, as if the reader were there as an observer.<br /><br />In both of his books on societal successes and failures Diamond's method has been straight-forward, although one all too rarely practiced.  He becomes highly familiar with a wide swath of the relevant primary literature, consultsextensively with the relevant experts, and then synthesizes broad conclusions that cut across academic disciplines and different cultures.  The insights gained are often quite rich, which is why we need polymaths like Diamond.  The results are imperfect, however.<br /><br />Diamond may be criticized for under-playing cultural factors in relation to material and environmental ones.  This is not a fatal limitation of Collapse, since the focus is generally on small subsistence societies, where the availability of sufficient food naturally was a chief determinant of survival.  And Diamond does not neglect cultural factors altogether.  For example, he ponders why the Norse settlers of Greenland apparently ate so little fish (very few fish bones show up in the archeological sites), since the fish were abundant, other food was not, and the settlers had migrated from a fish-eating society.  He speculates that an anti-fish taboo developed, perhaps because people had previously gotten sick from spoiled seafood.  The point here, though, is that his cultural explanation (the possible taboo) is weak and unpersuasive, in contrast to the stronger conclusions he builds for environmental causes of societal collapse.<br /><br />As enjoyable a read as Collapse is, its most sweeping message - that we can draw lessons from the past environmental failures to help make better decisions today - is less than satisfying.  On the one hand, this message is obvious; we do not need Diamond's book to tell us.  On the other hand, Diamond's extrapolation from the experience of less than a dozen failed societies where environmental degradation can be shown to have played a role is not fully convincing as prophesy for post-industrial society.<br /><br />His selected cases were mostly at the subsistence level and were in some instances literally insular, in others practically so (at least compared to global integration today).  As Diamond recognizes, if a society dies out from hunger now it will be because we have chosen to let it happen, not because no one else knew about it or was unable to help.  And as he is also well aware, now we have developed both new ways to destroy the environment (massive emissions of hydrocarbons are a salient example) and new ways to save it (alternatives to fossil fuels, for instance).  The details of what will contribute to our environmental demise or sustainability will undoubtedly differ from the societal stories Diamond relates, but he stands correct on what the primary determinant will be: human beings making either wise or disastrous political choices.d then synthesizes broad conclusions that cut across academic disciplines and different cultures.

0375701427|4.0|[[ASIN:0375701427 American Pastoral]]<br />This novel won a Pulitzer Prize and it deserved it.  Roth's fictional author, Nathan Zuckerman, imagines the subsequent life of a man he had once idolized as a high school sports star from his old Newark neighborhood, Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov.  Swede's troubles ultimately revolve around his daughter, Merry.<br /><br />The novel features more about the fine leather glove business and the demise of Newark than many readers may want to know, but for me the detailed inside-knowledge descriptions exemplify one of Roth's characteristic strengths.  He can also be quite funny, here especially when Lou Levov, Swede's father, speaks.<br /><br />Roth is the most socially insightful American author of our time, I think.  He is also among the best at portraying the inner lives of men whom I can readily imagine to be real, not just made-up characters.<br /><br />A minor complaint: some longueurs in a few of the extended dialogues between Swede Levov and Merry and, separately, with a character named Rita Cohen.  And just who is Rita Cohen, anyway, the Devil?
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Life around Mount Vesuvius before it erupts is very much the same as after - anxious, nervous, normal. The lives in this 2008 Woody Allen film are in many ways reminiscent of a hot and treacherous Italian volcano, alternating between grand, sensual, sleepy, beauty and fierce, explosive, irrational and uncontrollable eruptions.    Two women (Vicky and Cristina), the best of friends, sharing an abundance of common interests except for their impression of love, went on a long summer holiday in their friend Judy's home in Barcelona. Cristina, a sceptic of true love, ever willing to take risks in that regard, was also highly lacking in confidence in her talent as a photographer. Vicky, the steadier friend, engaged to marry Doug, had a conventional view of love. She believed that marriage is the consequence of love. Then they became attracted to Juan Antonio, a Spanish artist divorced from a tempestuous and multi-talented woman, Maria Elena, who keeps going back to him. Vicky, Cristina, and Maria Elena (estranged but no stranger) take turns to find sexual love with Juan Antonio, and Cristina even had a dalliance with Maria Elena. We can attribute the episodes of human exuberance to a combination of Spanish air, Spanish wine, and Spanish guitars; but one suspects that humans everywhere are the same. It is not in the air. It's in us. At the end of summer, Vicky and Cristina return to America. They were in the same positions as they left although Vicky had married Doug in the meantime but that seemed so irrelevant. We could see it in Vicky's eyes when they arrived at the airport back home. Everything on the surface seemed unchanged, even the gunshot wound on Vicky's hand was superficial.      It would only have the mark of general accuracy to describe this film as an existentialist effort. What would be the precise meaning of that? It is like two men agreeing with the statement \\"What a beautiful day!\\" The glorious sun would be the same to both of them; the soothing breeze would have been felt by both; and the birdsong enchant them both. Yet how can it be the same beautiful day if it struck the one when he had just got out of love, and the other when he was about to leap into it? Is it honesty or courage that gives us the chance to experience something new, uncomfortable and pleasurable in turn, and ultimately transforming us? That is one question the film invites us to think about. The other is love. Vicky, like most conventional people, believed that marriage is a consequence of love. She discovered on a hot, balmy evening in Barcelona that that was a false premise. It was false because one cannot attribute a consequence to a cause that one cannot know, understand, or even define. Occasionally, one might discover clues to its nature. Juan Antonio described his relationship with Maria Elena thus: \\"We were meant for each other; we were not meant for each other. It's a contradiction.\\" It applied equally to Vicky and Cristina; and to all of us. Juan Antonio had all the qualities of a libertine and yet we cannot condemn him for it. Was it because all the women saw him as he was and took him as such; and so expose all that lies suppressed in each of us by fear and hypocrisy?    Mount Vesuvius is still an active volcano.

David Lodge does.  The protagonist here, Desmond Bates, is a retired professor in his sixties, a bit of a curmudgeon but also tender-hearted and humane.  You may want to read this Lodge novel in conjunction with Julian Barnes' memoir Nothing to Be Frightened Of.  Both authors reference Philip Larkin's poem \\"Aubade\\":<br /> The sure extinction that we travel to<br />  And shall be lost in always. Not to be here,<br /> Not to be anywhere,<br /> And soon; nothing more terrible, nothing more true.
015206396X|5.0|I recently gotten into reading more \\"young adult\\" fiction and am finding so many fantastic books I would have missed out on.  This is one of them.  The NYT Review of Books had a smashing review of it, and that is where I first thought to take a look at it.  I wasn't disappointed.  Great, strong female main character who doesn't turn wimpy and lonesome when the tough stuff starts.  She stays true to herself and her beliefs.  Lots of strong characters, both female and male, and a truly wonderful author whose work I will continue to look forward reading for years to come.
0143038419|1.0|Possibly the most selfish, conceited, boring woman alive.  Is it remotely possible that with the exception of her poor exhusband she only knows the most beautiful, the most intelligent humans to inhabit earth? And that she counts herself amoung them?!  A total waste of the trees used to print this dribble of total self-absorption -- being paid to write about a years vacation is obscene!  Her eternity will be the smoking one. And I hope she never becomes a mother -- the poor child will be ignored for her mother's higher puroses or because the poor thing could never be as beautiful or smart as her mother...

1416550518|4.0|Grace Reeves is 98 years old and living in a nursing home.  A movie is being made about the notorious death of the poet R.S. Hunter at Riverton House. When a young filmmaker contacts Grace as the last living person to have knowledge of the events leading to his death, Grace is thrust back in her memories to that time just before World War I, and her life as a housemaid at Riverton.  Deciding she wants to tell the truth about all that happened she begins recording her story for her grandson, so he can know the truth of what she witnessed.<br /><br />This book tells the story of Grace in alternating chapters of the past and present. It has a gothic tinged tone to it, as we learn of the lives of the `Upstairs/Downstairs' people that populate Riverton. Starting out as a young girl of 14 Grace is slowly enmeshed in the life of the three siblings Hannah, Emmeline and David, the privileged upper class children who live at Riverton, eventually becoming Hannah's personal maid. As the Great War begins it wreaks havoc on many of the characters in the book, and at the end of the war many cracks are apparent in the separation of the English classes.  Soon both Hannah and Emmeline begin to rebel in ways that will have tragic results.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story that involved a mystery, two love stories and an impending feeling of doom. There were a couple of good twists in the narrative but I don't want to ruin it for anyone else, so I will just say it kept my attention throughout, and I am looking forward to another book by Ms. Morton.

0385340990|4.0|This is an absolutely delightful novel, filled with charm and characters so real you forget it is a novel.<br /><br />Written in an epistolary style, the heart of the book revolves around Juliet Ashton, a columnist who wrote stories of the war in London and its aftermath. Set in 1946 London the story begins when Juliet receives a letter from Guernsey, from a man who found her name in book her read and wanted to know if she knew of other books of that type. So begins a series of correspondence between Juliet and the residents of Guernsey and members of the Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Slowly Juliet realizes she wants to write a book about these people and their tragedies as well as heroic responses to war and deprivation. She goes to visit Guernsey, a trip that will change her entire life.<br /><br />I am a big fan of books told in letter format and this story was such a feel good experience and one that still brings a smile to my face when I think of it.  A lovely and touching novel that I have been recommending to everyone.

B001F12J0C|5.0|The Bourne trilogy is a very action packed collection of movies. The first one starts off a little slow but once the veiwer is \\"up to speed\\" the action doesn't stop. Great set of movies, and when we got them we had to watch them all in one night. I am not fond of the \\"letterbox\\" format and I was disapointed that was the format used, but once the action starts I didnt even notice that the top and bottom of the screen was black. The bonus features are interesting, and do add to the telling of the story. I would recomed this set to anyone that likes action type movies. Even if you arent an action movie fan this is one to watch.

0061120073|5.0|I absolutely love this book! It definitely deserves its standing as a classic novel! I am just so disappointed that this was never a required reading book in any of my high school or university classes! This sad and wonderful coming-of-age story is a completely engrossing read, and one that I wish I had discovered sooner! I already can't wait to re-read it!<br /><br />And though its setting takes place around WWI, and the city is New York City, the book really reminds me of my own grandparents (contemporaries of the author, not her characters) in many ways. I really enjoyed it - and I especially loved the narrator's relationship with books. This is just a really great book all in all!

I recommend this to anyone who likes a very action pack and suspense novel.  Its a great adventure.

0061139378|4.0|wasn't even aware that the new film Coraline was based on a novel. I'd been trying to decide if the movie would be too intense for my kids (particularly the youngest two) and as I was walking through the bookstore one night, I saw the book sitting on a shelf. I bought it and plowed through it in a couple of hours (it is a fairly quick read).<br /><br />Setting<br /><br />The setting of the story is a creepy old English house (manor?) that's been subdivided into a series of flats. Coraline lives with her family in one fairly standard flat. A strange old gypsy lives in the flat formed from the attic. And a pair of retired eccentric fortune telling thespians live on the other side of the main level. Between them all is a flat with no tenants that exists behind a brick wall on the other side of a door in Coraline's drawing room.<br /><br />The layout of the house and its surrounding are a bit creepy in themselves. Coraline is an explorer by trade (is it fair of me to call it a \\"trade\\" for such a young girl) and so she's explored the outside of the house as well as some of the rooms of her neighbors. The yard/grounds are run down. The house itself seems to lack any real personality at present but shows evidence of a great personality in days gone by.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />The main character is obviously Coraline Jones. We really get into her head and walk alongside her every action and get to partake of her thoughts, fears and motivations. This intimacy helps accentuate the scary elements presented in the book.<br /><br />As Coraline encounters other characters, we're always looking at them through her eyes, so it's difficult to see just how strange they may be. Still, even trying to discount Coraline's bias, it's easy enough to see by their actions and their environments that these are definitely strange adults...bordering closely on the line of crazy.<br /><br />Coraline's parents are fairly standard as far as fairy tale parents go...they are disinterested, uninvolved parents who don't seem to care for Coraline's welfare and who quickly disappear from her life. They are probably the most \\"realistic\\" and \\"sane\\" characters in the book. They also serve as a sort of commentary on parental involvement...they are definitely not the sort of parents a kid would like to have (nor the sort of parent a parent should try to be).<br /><br />Miss Forcible and Miss Spink are the next most influential set of characters on Coraline from the \\"real world.\\" They really sit in a sort of peripheral role but they do read Coraline's fortune in the tea leaves and give her a strange magical talisman. Beyond that, they seem to be just another pair of eccentrics.<br /><br />Mister Bobo (aka the man upstairs) is given very little treatment in the book except appearing to be very crazy as he talks to the mice he's trying to train into circus performers. As you pay attention to the things the mice \\"tell\\" him, it's apparent that he may not be as crazy as we think.<br /><br />The Other Mother (aka beldam) is the real antagonist in the story. She lures Coraline into the other world and tries to entice her to stay by giving her \\"everything she wants.\\" It quickly becomes apparent that the Other Mother has ulterior motives and is not just looking for Coraline's \\"love\\" as she claims. The Other Mother takes on grotesque characteristics and behaviors that could be truly terrifying to younger children.<br /><br />The Cat is an interesting character. It seems to serve as Coraline's guide through the other world and a sort of sounding board to explore ideas and learn about the Other Mother and the other world. The cat doesn't seem to have his (her? its?) own motivations and acts very nonchalant towards Coraline, and yet he does seem to have some desire to help her.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />I've heard this story referred to as kind of a creepy Alice in Wonderland. While it does involve a girl going into a strange sort of world where everything behaves strangely...and it does have a talking cat that sometimes gives enigmatic advice...don't think that simply loving Alice means you'll love Coraline. More specifically, if a young child loves the Alice stories, don't view Coraline as a logical transition.<br /><br />Realize that the comparison includes the word \\"creepy.\\" This truly is a child's horror story. The plot includes a protagonist diving headlong into a strange and unpredictable world, fighting for her own life/soul and the lives/souls of her parents and three unidentified other children. There are occasional moments of whimsy but they are very short lived, to be replaced by images ranging from the slightly creepy to the skin-crawlingly scary.<br /><br />As Coraline gets more and more involved in the plot, the events grow more and more scary. The \\"other\\" characters she encounters (the actresses, her father, the man upstairs) start out almost as normal as their real world counterparts, but as the story progresses, they each are involved in action that is rather scary.<br /><br />The actions of the Other Mother are perhaps the most frightening. And even when it seems Coraline has finally won and it's time for the story to wrap up, you begin to wonder if the horror will ever truly end. With only two chapters left in the book, Coraline suddenly faces a new terror and has to overcome a new challenge.<br /><br />Overall<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed the book. It was a very quick read and I did wish that it had another hundred pages to it where it could have gone into more depth about some of the trials Coraline faced, or perhaps introduce some new elements. It also felt like it took perhaps a little long to get started, but that back story really helped, so I probably wouldn't remove it except for the fact that younger readers might get bored before getting into the meat of the tale.<br /><br />My main curiosity is as to the target demographic. This definitely seemed a bit more scary than the Goosebumps books my son has been reading. I don't necessarily think it's too scary for him but I am still nervous about handing it to him to read on a school night (for fear of a nightmare filled sleepless night). It's definitely a dark read.<br /><br />Maybe I'm making kids out to be more wussy than they are but this seemed like too much for younger kids...and yet teenagers may be put off by how young the protagonist is and how simplistic the events are.<br /><br />This is a lot of fun and I can recommend it to older readers with a penchant for the creepy but am hesitant to recommend it to kids under ~10. I'm definitely interested to see how the movie plays out...from the previews I've seen, it looks more entertaining/whimsical than the book (the preview shows numerous \\"fun\\" elements that aren't in the book)...which means it might be more accessible to younger kids. If anybody's seen the movie, let me know what you think.<br /><br />****<br /><br />3.5 starsg Alice means you'll love Coraline.

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|The negative reviewers' attitudes exemplify everything that is wrong with America. The \\"Duke\\" was not abusing Kate, he was merely playfully providing her with a reality check and an attitude adjustment. Mr. McLintock was not spanking violently. Right now, we need politically incorrect humor that humiliates and offends pompous, condescending people like the bureaucrats and elites that are portrayed in this film.  Political Correctness has destroyed this great nation and it's people like you who need to lighten up, get a grip, and regain common sense. I understand (and for the most part agree about) where some of you are coming from, but John Wayne - one of the greatest Americans that ever lived - is someone every American should look up to.<br /><br />The first ten minutes are very relevant to the present-day situation our government is causing and I hope you do not overlook this fact.<br /><br />I'm only 26, but this film has become one of my favorites of all time.
B000FC1192|5.0|The best thing I can say about Coraline: It reminded me strongly of being a child. It is a classic fairy tale, the kind I loved as a kid. A clever child using her wits to overcome extraordinary challenges.     Most childrens' works condescend and pander in the extreme; They feature dumb adults that need to change and come to respect their more clever offspring. Written by someone else, Coraline's adventure might have ended with her parents' snap realization that they need to shower more attention on their daughter. Gaiman's version has a much more muted and realistic end: Coraline opens up and shows some more affection to her parents, and they respond in kind.    I - an adult - enjoyed Coraline, but I think it has the right mix of adventure and honesty to make a child fall in love with it.
0345350472|5.0|After reading the other reviews, I thought I would answer some of the questions that occur from reading the amazon blurb and the reviews. This is not a review of the book; it is an attempt to help you understand what happened between 3 different books - all of which are titled Blade Runner.    Alan E. Nourse wrote the original book titled \\"The Bladerunner\\". (IMPORTANT - note the difference in the titles. One has a \\"space\\" between \\"Blade Runner\\", the other title \\"The Bladerunner\\" does not have a \\"space\\".) It is totally a different book and plot from the Philip K Dick novel originally titled \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\". The plot (of Nourse's book)is as described on the amazon page regarding the original Alan E Nourse book. When the movie (Blade Runner) was made, the directors/producers changed the name from \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" to Blade Runner. This is because the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" left out or edited out the aspects of the story that gave the original title it's meaning and pertinence. (If you have read the original Philip K Dick story you know what I mean.) I think if you watch the credits closely you will see that Alan E Nourse is given credit for the title. I don't know if they bought the title from him or not.    I give the original \\"The Bladerunner\\" by Alan E. Nourse a 5 star rating. I give Philip K. Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" a 5 star rating. I give the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" a 5 star rating.    The book, \\"Blade Runner: A Movie\\" by William S Burroughs is essentially Burroughs attempt to rewrite Nourse's book into a form from which a movie could be made.    Here is what Wikipedia says regarding this issue: \\"His novel (meaning Nourse) The Bladerunner lent its name to the Blade Runner movie, but no other aspects of its plot or characters, which were taken from Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? In the late 1970s an attempt to adapt The Bladerunner for the screen was made, with Beat Generation authorWilliam S. Burroughs commissioned to write a story treatment; no film was ever developed but the story treatment was later published as the novella, Blade Runner (a movie).\\" The first sentence of this quote is a poorly written sentence. The author of the wikipedia article was trying to say that ONLY the title \\"Blade Runner\\" was borrowed from Nourse. Everything else in the movie is stricly from the Philip K Dick novel.    I have not read the Burroughs version yet. I will be buying it just to round out my \\"collection\\" of items regarding an interesting story of scifi history. I greatly enjoy other William Burroughs books but suspect I won't be happy with this \\"interpretation\\" for movie making purposes. I gave it 3 stars just to give it the benefit of the doubt.

0440243661|5.0|Bad Luck & Trouble was the third Jack Reacher book that I have read from Lee Child.  Like the other two (One Shot and the Hard Way), Child grabbed my attention in the first few pages, in this case when an unknown man is unceremoniously thrown to his death from a helicopter at 3,00 feet.  Enter Jack Reacher and his former colleagues as they untangle the mystery and extract retribution.  Reacher's physical and mental toughness, tenacity, perseverance, ruthlessness and survival instincts are on display throughout the book, leading to a very compelling story.  Simply put, start to finish, this is a great novel that is impossible to put down.  While admittedly, these works are only a sampling of the full body of work, Child has quickly worked his way onto my \\"must read\\" list.  I definitely need to go back for more.
B001H5X7KC|4.0|This action comedy was very fun and overall a entertaining story line.  A few of the extras that stand out include commentary with ben stiller, jack black, and a hilarious robert downey, jr. voicing as his character in the movie.  Another interesting extra included are full reels of select moments in the movie; basically the actors performing variations of their lines over and over until the tape runs out.  It was a new perspective for me that shows that even a fun movie like tropic thunder can be harder work for the actors than i previously imagined.  Overall, a good movie and I learned something new about the movie making process.

She does a lot of squats which I try to avoid so I do something else.  Overall, a good workout but I don't think the girls got their bodies from doing this alone.

There is 2 versions of My Immortal on the album, the acoustic version with the piano interlude and the rock version as heard on the radio.<br /><br />The album is good with hits like My Immortal, Bring Me to Life, Going Under, and many more.<br /><br />This album is really worth it.

0802136834|5.0|Ms Weir has written many fascinating books, but this is arguably her best. The Six Wives of Henry VIII is an exceptionally written biography of King Henry's many wives. The book is divided into three parts. The first begins with Katherine of Aragon and proceeds with Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour. Anne of Cleves, Katherine Howard, and Katherine Parr are discussed in part three.    I have read many books on the Tudor period. I admit that Anne Boleyn books are my favorite read, but Alison Weir's account of all six wives was enthralling as any Boleyn book I have ever read. Her easy-to-read and vivid manner of writing will make you breeze through this 600 page book.     While the book is about Henry's six wives, the author argues that certain events helped shape the image of the wife-murdering tyrant that many think of today when they hear the name Henry VIII. Alison Weir believes Katherine of Aragon's stubborness in fruitlessly clinging to her marriage and Anne Boleyn arrogance contributed to King Henry's malevolent character. The author reminds the readers of the importance of judging Henry VIII's actions through sixteenth-century standards. Was it not his job to provide male heirs to his kingdom? If  one views the events that transpired in that manner, one may almost find themselves sympathizing with Henry VIII. Almost!    Look at the facts. Katherine of Aragon was unable to provide male heirs, her successor also failed. Jane Seymour died shortly after child birth leaving the King with one boy who may or may not survive to adulthood. (Skipped Anne of Cleves for now) Katherine Howard was guilty of adultery and provided the King with a valid excuse for her execution. Anne of Cleves, however, was set aside without the King knowing if she was capable of providing male heirs. If judged by sixteenth-century standards, Henry VIII did his country a great disservice by casting aside a queen simply because he found her unappealing. How many kings before him sired heirs with women they found unattractive?  Too many to count!  In a further attempt to humanize Henry VIII, Alison Weir also states that the Jane Seymour considered King Henry a loving husband. She may not have felt the same had she lived longer. Same goes for Katherine Parr. The author claims the King refused to believe ill of his Queen without adequate proof. Katherine had quite a close call. The King was certainly forgiving, which I doubt had been the case if he had been younger and in better health.     I disagree with Ms Weir's attempt to create a more sympathetic view of King Henry, but the book was still fascinating. I had no problems with the material concerning the king's six wives. All the information provided was well-researched and as in all her books extremely readable.  If you want to learn more about King Henry VIII wives without purchasing separate biogrpahies on each woman, this is the book to buy.

B000CNESU8|5.0|I made a statement a few months back when I reviewed `The Hospital', written by Paddy Chayefsky.  That comment was that I had yet to see `Network' and after my uninspiring experience with `The Hospital' I wasn't going to race to see it either.  Well, this happened to air on TCM the other night and I did watch it, and I must say that my reaction to this film is a far cry from my reaction to the former.  Where `The Hospital' failed in terms of relevancy and proper balance of subject (that is, the humor was poorly crafted and the drama was over worked) `Network' soars; perfectly etching out what makes this subject so poignant.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that `Network' is a film that probably ages better than most; a film that means more to the general public today than it did upon its release.<br /><br />Back in 1976 this was intended as a satire; but when watched today the film is almost chilling.<br /><br />`Network' follows the struggles for ratings as a certain network abuses the mental state of an employee in order to boost their ratings.  Howard Beale is an anchorman who has just lost his job because of poor ratings.  Upon hearing the news he announces on live air that he is going to commit suicide on the air.  That little stunt caused their viewers to spike and thus saved Beale his job.  Diana Christensen is the ratings obsessed producer who has no qualms with using Beale's instability to her advantage.  Max Schumacher, the executive over the news department, doesn't want to play along.  He sees the danger in exposing Beale, and his care and concern for Beale as a person causes him to slip into a depression as he watches this man unravel.<br /><br />The film flawlessly captures the power struggle man goes through to dominate their field.  It also exposes the almost callused way a woman would have to be in order to rise above in a male dominated profession.  Diana is hard and cold and bitter.  Her personal life takes a backseat to her professional life, because in order for her to make it she has to stay one-hundred percent devoted to her craft.  This means that her relationships suffer because she can't make that distinction.  The film is also telling when it comes to the idea of murder; which is tossed around the board room like it was everyday conversation.<br /><br />Anything goes.<br /><br />The performances are all stellar, across the board.  Faye Dunaway, Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight all won Oscars for their performances; but in my opinion it's William Holden and the un-nominated Robert Duvall that really steal the show.  Holden is beyond flawless as the flawed executive Max Schumacher.  He is the glue that holds the film together; the moral compass lost in the sea of immorality.  His final scene with Faye Dunaway is the best moment in the film.  Faye is also a beacon here, a true testament to her immense talent as she bulldozes through her scenes with such commanding strength.  She's a lethal combination of stern determination and biting wit.  Her Oscar win was very well deserved.  Peter Finch has the showiest role, and he handles it very well, but to say he was better than Holden (and more so, than the nominated De Niro, who defeats all with his uncanny performance in `Taxi Driver') is a bit of a stretch.  I'm sure sympathy weighed in heavy that night (he had died prior to the nominations being announced) but still, regardless of deserved or not; the performance was very well done.  I was particularly drawn to Duvall, who just nailed his portrayal of the network overseer Frank Hackett.  He had the perfect balance of greed, fear and startling ambition.<br /><br />The film is a very honest and blunt attack at the media and the immoral way in which these men (and women) of power will manipulate, use and discard whoever and whatever necessary to deliver to the viewer what they think they want.  Masked over with the façade of doing all for the general public, these greedy individuals manipulate our thinking capacities for their own selfish gain.<br /><br />I guess you can't believe everything you see on television.s you can't believe everything you see on television.
0553381695|5.0|This second volume in the Song of Ice and Fire is every bit as good as the first, [[ASIN:0553381687 A Game of Thrones]].  Picking up where the first book left off, this one continues the heart-rending and intense journey of some of my favorite characters in all of fantasy literature.  Martin is undeniably one of the most skillful writers when it comes to character development, and the directions some of his characters take in this book will surprise you. With much of the world-building having been accomplished in the first book, this one provides even more action, with some of the most intense scenes I've ever read.  Even though it is a long book, I didn't want it to end, and can hardly wait to read the next.<br /><br />One of my favorite things about this series is the incredibly detailed world that it takes place in.  It is so easy to get pulled into this setting, with its rich history and well-developed geography and climate.  The detailed (and maybe overwhelming) noble houses and lineages going back generations help bring the world to life and set the readers perspective as to the past and present.  Many times while reading this book, I found myself flipping back to the detailed map (and wishing there was one of the Eastern continent) as I just wanted to know as much as I could about exactly where each event was taking place and where it was in relations to other places.  Martin's land of Westeros is huge, and the map is detailed, but it isn't wasted space, as events in this book take place all over the entire land.<br /><br />While most of the POV characters in this one are the same as in the first book (with the exception of Davos Seaworth and a couple of others), they continue to develop here.  You'll find yourself changing your mind about characters as you learn more about their motivations and capabilities.  At least for me, some of my favorite characters in the first book turned into my least favorite here, and some I despised in the first book became some of my favorites.  I thought Theon Greyjoy would be an excellent character, but here he develops into something terrible.  Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister has quickly become one of my favorite characters I've read about in any book.<br /><br />Martin's use of POV for different characters really works well in this series.  Learning about the land and getting unique view of events through the eyes of disparate characters allows for a lot of freedom and opportunities that Martin takes full advantage of.  Some reviewers have complained about the nonlinear feel of the story, jumping around between characters and leaving the reader with awful cliffhangers and a mad desire to keep reading from the current point of view.  While it is frustrating at times, it is a good sort of frustrating, and meant as a tease to keep you frantically turning pages to get back to that characters next section and see what happens.  But, as you start reading about the next character, you realize that you'd just as soon stick with that one than go back to the last one.  And, with a tale this big (and I mean HUGE), you absolutely have to jump between storylines frequently, and in my opinion Martin does it almost flawlessly.<br /><br />The action is this second book is certainly more intense than the previous.  The battle for King's Landing in particular is out of this world, with alchemist fire, dwarf-men leading charges, and devastation and destruction run rampant.  Overall though, it is still the intensity of emotion that drives this story.  Characters that you love are put through some of the most unimaginable ordeals and you can't help being scared for them, as Martin has already shown us his willingness to kill off nearly anyone.  You'll find yourself laughing with the characters when things go wrong, but dreading to turn the page when you fell upcoming doom.<br /><br />Get dragged into this story and you won't be sorry.  That is unless you finish the most recent book and the series isn't done yet..  This is my second time through, and I now realize I'll end up with the same frustrating feeling of not being able to finish the story because Martin takes so awfully long to publish these books.  They are worth the torment though.  Most highly recommended!h, and I now realize I'll end up with the same frustrating feeling of not being able to finish the story because Martin takes so awfully long to publish these books.

B000E1MXSW|5.0|There are few films that can say so much with so little; but `The Nun's Story' does just that.  In a simple and none-to-evasive premise the film tackles the weighty subject of faith and all its variables but never feels heavy handed or overly stuffed.  In fact, despite its two-hour-plus running time, the film has a very breezy feel to it; relaxed and nicely paced and totally engaging.<br /><br />The film tells the story of young Gabrielle van der Mal who desires to become a nursing nun in the Congo.  She pursues her passion yet is met with setbacks, both inside the convent but also within herself.  She taps into something every intimate; very internal that causes her to question whether this course was the right course for her.  She questions whether this life of a nun, no matter how important to her, is really a life she can fully commit to.<br /><br />Can she fully give herself over, even when she doesn't fully agree?<br /><br />Like I mentioned, the plot is quite simple.  Gabrielle is accepted into the nunhood (her new name being Sister Luke) and eventually makes her way to her desired destination; the Congo.  She becomes nurse to an unbelieving Doctor (played by Peter Finch) and it is under his thumb that she begins to doubt herself to a fuller extent.<br /><br />Director Fred Zennemann tackles this subject with a beautiful delicacy that really elevates the film, tapping into that genuine and intimate place that Gabrielle finds herself.  We are given a very real look at the conflicting emotions of those devoted in faith and it asks some very weighty questions and delivers a very personal answer.  Zennemann is matched all the way by his stars, Hepburn especially.  Audrey (my favorite Hepburn) is stunning as Gabrielle.  She captures, sometimes without even a word, this woman's inner demons.  She manages to make her a three dimensional, real person to us, complete with flaws and quirks and very genuine concerns.  Peter Finch is in fine form as Dr. Fortunati, the man who helps bolster in Gabrielle the courage to question her own aspirations, and Edith Evans (Dame Edith Evans) is stunning as the Reverend Mother Emmanuel, a woman so devoted to her faith that she sparks controversy within her actions.<br /><br />`The Nun's Story' is not simply a film for the religious.  This is a film for everyone.  Don't allow the subject matter to be off putting, for the film is developed in a way that will cause no discomfort or offence.  This is a movie that handles its weighty matter with grace and serenity; delivering an honest portrait while remaining easy to swallow.  With some stunning performances and some poignant material, `The Nun's Story' remains easily one of the most important films of the 50's.n who helps bolster in Gabrielle the courage to question her own aspirations, and Edith Evans (Dame Edith Evans) is stunning as the Reverend Mother Emmanuel, a woman so devoted to her faith that she sparks controversy within her actions.<br /><br />`The Nun's Story' is not simply a film for the religious.

B000002GQE|5.0|THE ORIGINAL MOODY BLUES AT THEIR BEST.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|I'm so excited to be writing a review for Woody's latest film `Vicky Cristina Barcelona'.  This was one of the more rewarding cinematic experiences for me this past year and I just melt every time I think about its splendor.  There are few films that ignite in me a warmth that is of the delightful kind, mostly because I relish more brooding fare, but every once in a while I find myself smitten with a film that has the ability to transport me to a happy place, and this film does that very thing.  Instead of wrecking me emotionally, `Vicky Cristina Barcelona' manages to revitalize me, making me feel refreshed and anew.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two young friends, Vicky and Cristina, who travel to (you guessed it) Barcelona for a summer of freedom before Vicky marries her boyfriend Doug.  Vicky, who is getting her major in Catalan Identity, is intrigued with immersing herself in the culture all around her while Cristina, who is flirtatiously trying to find herself, is ready to immerse herself in just about anything.  When the girls meet the mysteriously charming painter Juan Antonio Gonzalo they have very differing opinions of him.  Vicky is immediately turned off by his rather blunt offer (to take them away for the weekend to eat, drink and make love) while Cristina finds him interesting and intriguing and is ready to jump right in (literally).  What sparks next is a love triangle that becomes a square when Juan's feisty ex-wife Maria Elena walks back into his life.<br /><br />Vicky, who has always felt that all she wanted was a stable life with her very ordinary boyfriend Doug has found that all she thought she wanted has been questioned by her unpredictable affair with Juan, and Cristina, who has never really ever known what she really wanted, has found that all she knows is what she doesn't want when her relationship with Juan and Maria, which seems to be going so well, fails to keep her satisfied.<br /><br />Some have baulked at the films blatant stereotyping and seemingly banal view of relationships, but what those complainers are failing to see is that the whole point of this film is that nothing is what we as typical Americans (or even typical humans) expect it to be.  The film attacks our narrow view of what is normal and bizarre by giving us two very opposite extremes of our perspective of relationships.  There is the cookie-cutter idea that man loves woman, man marries woman, they live happily ever after and then there is the free-love idea of woman loves man who loves woman and another woman and that woman loves the other woman so they all get together and live happily ever after.  There is no balance because the film is attacking the simplistic and exacting view of modern society who at times fails to see that there are many types of relationships and many types of lives.  Cristina, who knows that she doesn't want what Vicky has, is quick to plunge herself into something new, something out of the box, with Juan and Maria.  This is her idea of what she thinks she wants, beings that she only knows what she doesn't want.  She herself doesn't realize that just because she doesn't want the `ordinary' life doesn't mean that she has to want to `extraordinary' life either.<br /><br />When you understand why the stereotypes are there then you can appreciate the film much more.<br /><br />The acting across the board is superb.  A lot of people have attacked Scarlett Johansson as of late for her supposed throwaway acting.  They accuse her of not trying, of playing it safe; but when you exude the type of sensuality needed to play Cristina without having to try, why should she be panned.  She is perfection here, capturing the spirit of Cristina magnificently.  Rebecca Hall is also stunning here as Vicky, the complete opposite of Cristina.  She balances her characters standoffish almost snobbery with her natural curiosity and confused emotional breakdown very well.  Javier Bardem is charming and entertaining and engaging as Juan, but the women around him steal his light.  No one steals the light quite like the breathtaking Penelope Cruz, who just sizzles and pops as Maria Elena.  Her feisty take on the angry ex-wife is stunning.  She may be the biggest stereotype, but like I said, it is that stereotype that propels the films message.<br /><br />I am in awe of this film and it is truly one of Woody Allen's greatest films.  This feels very fresh when you consider that a lot of Allen's films can carry the same vibe.  He attacks his favorite subject, that of relationships, but he does so with a different spin, with a refreshing cast and with a very bright, sunny and enjoyable result.eal his light.

0316017922|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and I had not read his other two books before. I was very impressed with the great writing and had a hard time putting it down, finishing it in a weekend. Many interesting angles which had me constantly think about personal (children education) and professional (cultural implications, longer job rotations, simplification) applications. I immediately bought his other books since this is exactly the kind of inspirational read/style I am looking for - fun, informative and powerful. Highly recommended for everyone.
B000001EEN|5.0|My name isn't Bill, but let's get to the point here: this was essentially an intervention by Pete Townsend and Steve Winwood to get Clapton out of his house and into a work detail at which he could succeed, instead of taking junk all the live long day. It didn't pay off immediately for Clapton, but who knows, maybe it was an important push at the time. What is kind of ironic is that the lineup is an all star 12 step candidates list, some of whom have been successful, others not. But they did turn in an awfully impressive show(s). I never knew that there were two nights until I read Clap's book. The comments made about the editing are a little beside the point for most of us. Were you around when this first was released on vinyl, you were likely very non-plussed. That is the effect of the limitations of the LP format and the shortsightedness of Clapton's management, because it is clearly evident that the very good comraderie on display added to an enhanced evening. While tempos are at times different than what you might expect, there are no two ways about it that this collection of luminaries checked egos at the door and got in the pocket and stayed there. This is a rootsier and bluesier version of most of these songs than Clapton delivered elsewhere and the strengths are shared 'round. The good humour of the between song patter demythologizes all of them and makes the music much more effective and immediate.<br />I would agree that it is high time for Clapton to get hold of the rights to this show and deliver a special edition, legacy edition, whatever it's called that features both nights. On what's on here, the quality of the performance, for all the addictions and demons being confronted, is among Clapton's best. God Bless Pete Townsend.

Throughout this mammoth of a thrash-metal album, we get huge heavy complex guitar riffs, Randy's trademark growls and spoken-word parts, harmonized guitar lines and jaw-droppingly awesome drum work, with everything from insane double bass, razor-sharp triplets and use of every piece of the kit.  The standout songs are \\"Laid to Rest\\", \\"Now You've Got Something to Die For\\", \\"Omerta\\", and \\"Ashes of the Wake\\", although every song on this album showcases Lamb of God at the peak of their game.

I started a couple days ago doing level 1 and then following it with level 2 (skipping cool down on first level & warm-up on second).

0316017922|5.0|Very \\"rarely\\" we come across books that we would like to finish in one sitting. But as the word \\"rare\\" explains, when it happens, it is statistically an \\"outlier\\".     I was attracted to buy this book on two counts. Firstly, Gladwell's earlier books have been superb. In addition the word \\"outlier\\" itself is one that has puzzled me as a student of Statistics, in which I always felt that the subject is missing a great deal of information in what it tends to ignore and discard during analysis. My firm belief has been that outliers are not to be discarded but to be analyzed in greater detail, perhaps to explain the main phenomena. Having said this, I could find neither the time nor the right opportunity to analyze and research into situations where data outliers are taken seriously.    Welcome aboard the yet another masterpiece from Malcolm Gladwell.      The selection process of young boys in Canadian boy's hockey team ensures that boys born in January, February and March have a significant advantage over their younger competitors born later in the year, since a few months in age make a (statistically and actual) significant difference in performance in the game at school. Those who excel in Hockey thereafter are because they were born earlier in the first place. True talent is relegated to frustration and oblivion, at least 70 % of the population, statistically speaking.    Look at the great divide in attitudes between the Northern and Southern states of USA. (as explained by the author). Those in the South have developed a \\"Culture of Honor\\" and are easily irritable by simple taunts. Their ancestors' have predominantly lived in mountainous regions as shepherds, constantly guarding their cattle from being stolen and had to develop and sustain a belligerent attitude of aggression against possible intruders and thieves. The Northerners on the other hand had ample agricultural land which required patience to till and grow and cooperation to cultivate that they had a verydifferent way of looking at life. They even tend to ignore and laugh at irritants that can make the southerner burst into anger.    (Perhaps this calls for a theory termed \\"directional attitude\\")    The well known \\"Hofstede's dimensions\\" are used extensively especially in management education across multinational companies to sensitize executives with transnational assignments. In this book, Gladwell describes \\"power distance\\" to explain air crashes. Pilots in \\"high power distance\\" countries use \\"mitigated speech\\", whereby the junior pilots never challenge even a sleeping commander on his bad flight decisions, ultimately crashing the aircraft with the crew and its passengers. Statistically, an air crash is an \\"outlier\\". The truth lies else where. I learnt from this book that it requires more effort to crash a passenger aircraft than to fly it!    One more great analysis is the relationship between working in rice fields and proficiency in mathematics. Rice is the most difficult crop to grow and it requires hard work and diligence. \\"No one who can rise before dawn 360 days in a year fails to make his family rich\\". This explains the Chinese excelling in mathematics in American schools. Mr. Gladwell, please include the children from India as well in your next edition for this coveted acclaim.    Gladwell's personal account of how he himself is an \\"outlier\\" or a person to excel is a fitting finale of this outstanding work.    Superb in analysis, excellent in content and coherent in logic, this is a book that none can afford to miss.    A well deserved five star rating without any hesitation.

But in the kingdom of Middluns where King Randa presides, those whose eyes \\"settle\\" into two different colors--and show a potentially useful Grace (such as mind reading, fighting, swift running, enormous strength, or incredible vision) are sent to live in Randa's court...and to serve his whims and wishes.<br /><br />I won't spoil any of the juicy details by providing too much plot, so fearless reader, you may read on!<br /><br />Towards the beginning of Graceling, the plot seemed bogged down with kingdom descriptions and Katsa's initial treks to do King Randa's bidding. In fact, when I had a back injury that confined me to a recliner for days, I just couldn't push my way through those parts--so I didn't pick the book up for several weeks.<br /><br />Now, had I received Graceling through the Amazon Vine program (for free), or perhaps picked it up at the library, I would have put the book down and likely not have pick it up again.<br /><br />But you know how it is when you pay full price for something...you're much more inclined to stick with it, to get your money's worth and all that.<br /><br />And I am SO glad I did!<br /><br />I just finished Graceling, and it was one of the finest fiction books (Young Adult OR Adult) that I've read in a looong time. Halfway through the book, where the action really notches up, I began to realize WHY author Cashore establishes some of the characters and environment as she did in the beginning--the parts I previously thought were slow and a tad boring.<br /><br />I became thrust in Cashore's well-drawn world, eagerly looking forward to breaks in my day to steal away some time to spend with Katsa and company. Let me tell you, dear reader, there is SUCH a great payoff in the end (several, actually!), that I felt not only gratified at the time spent reading Graceling, but also satisfied at how the author \\"resolves\\" some of the issues presented in the book.<br /><br />Although this book is recommended for ages 14 and up, I think maybe it should be for teens 16 and up (because of violence and other...um, situations...both actual and implied).<br /><br />With a strong, likable heroine owned by no one, Graceling explores what it means to be human--and how trust, friendship, and love can shape and soften the \\"wildness\\" of a girl led to believe that killing was her only \\"gift\\"...and value.<br /><br />P.S. I highly recommend that you DO NOT watch the \\"trailer\\" for Graceling here at Amazon.com! It includes spoilers in my opinion. (And I envision Po to be a whole lot hotter, to boot!)<br /><br />-- Janet Boyer, author of The Back in Time Tarot Bookcommend that you DO NOT watch the \\"trailer\\" for Graceling here at Amazon.com!

0763619612|5.0|Last year I read this at one of my staff development in-services and there wasn't one person who shuffled a paper or lost focus.  That is a remarkable feat!  This is an ABSOLUTE MUST OWN and MUST READ at least once per year for anyone who works with children. Follow the remarkable story of how one reluctant learner transforms his self-esteem with one dot.  Be mesmerized as he uses his dots to inspire other reluctant students who soon look up to his remarkable feats as an accomplished artist.  It is the ultimate testament to my all-time favorite quote that I first came across in Mitch Albom's best-selling memoir TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE [[ASIN:0751529818 Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, a Young Man and Life's Greatest Lesson]] : \\"A teacher affects eternity; he can never tell where his influence stops.\\" --Henry Adams Buy it and find the nearest reluctant learner to inspire him or her to leave his mark, I mean DOT, on the world!
B0000AK7AA|4.0|I think this movie is really good. Casper was one of my favorite cartoon characters and this movie was made really well. My daughter loves it, and I can admit I like this move also.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|Loved the Ace CD - almost perfect except Torpedo Girl would have been better than Two Sides of the Coin (never did care for that song).  Peter's was better than expected - especially Strangeways and Mainline.  Liked that Paul's and Gene's included some rarer stuff but I would have liked some more songs that weren't on all the other compilations.  How about Flaming Youth, World Without Heroes, Tommorrow & Tonight and Burning Up With Fever?  But overall, I was thrilled with this collection.
B000002UAX|3.0|I heard this ten years ago for the first time. It doesn't hold up for me and I say this as a one time hardcore Beatles fan. I know how certain albums are to be listened to as a whole. BUT you want to see just what the quality is like you have to take a closer look - at the individual songs. I realised that I was neglecting this and some other Beatles albums - they were always in my classic 'list' in my mind but I never found myself playing it. And when I took out song by song and played them I knew why. They're just not that interesting and certainly not brilliant. To begin with I always skipped a few songs like Ob-la-di, Wild honey, Rev 9, there's atleast about 10 similar complete fillers. And many of the other tracks, Sexy Sadie, Continuing story, Piggies, Racoon, my monkey, none of these are worthy of being called classic. I'm sorry but people are way too influenced by the mythical status of the Beatles (by all means call me a basher) to actually notice what they listen to. I've whittled it down to 14 songs I actually do like, but even these I never play anymore, I've worn them out with too much listening way back.       Back in the U.S.S.R.    Dear Prudence    While My Guitar Gently Weeps    Happiness Is a Warm Gun    Martha My Dear    Blackbird    I Will    Julia    Yer Blues    Mother Nature's Son    Helter Skelter    Long, Long, Long    Honey Pie    Good Night
B001QKSWOE|3.0|I started to read the sample, but just like one other reviewer I found the odd spacing to be a detriment to the ability to smoothly read, and somewhat jarring too.     When I tried to have it read to me (one of my favorite features of the Kindle) I found that here too it did not do a good job. It includes extraneous punctuation marks as part of the reading, something that does not happen with my other books. Additionally the split words in the type also split in the audio version.    I think that with so many other choices I would wait until the address some of these problems
B001JNNE64|1.0|The music of Mozart is glorious.  By itself, it has sufficient power to sustain the movie from the beginning to the end.  Don't look for historical accuracy here (no scholars believe that Salieri poisoned Mozart) but this is entertainment, not a documentary.  The nude scene where Elizabeth Berridge strips and bares her ample breasts is totally uncalled for and destroys the logic of the film.  Without the scene, Constanza rightfully resents Salieri for his jealousy of Mozart's unsurpassed composition skills.  With the scene, Constanze becomes a cheap slut spurned by Salieri.  The theatrical release is much better.  Too bad it is not on Blu ray.
B000AP04OM|5.0|An outstanding anniversary edition to celebrate its 40th anniversary date!  The Sound of Music lifts one's spirit and soul every time it is watched.  Our family of 5 fell in love with this movie when it was first released.  In the recent past, our grandchildren have thrilled to this movie on VHS tape.  And, now with all the special features for this anniversary DVD edition, there is even more to praise and enjoy.  Thank goodness these movies from the past have such grand staying-power over the decades.  There aren't that many grand movies being made today that families with all ages can enjoy watching together. We wish that all the special features of past editions could have been incorporated into this 40th anniversary DVD.  Since they weren't, we'll continue to enjoy those on our VHS tape.  Thanks, Rodgers and Hammerstein, for this beloved musical. Thanks, Julie Andrews, for our beloved Maria.  Thanks, too, to all the \\"children\\" and Christopher Plummer for their endearing portrayals.

B000TETD9Q|5.0|There are a lot of mono versions of \\"God Only Knows\\" and this is one of the few Albums that has the stereo version of it. If you are a fan of this song, you will find the best stereo mix on this album compared to other albums.
B000002UAU|2.0|This is a general problem I have with the entire Beatles catalouge; hardly anything holds up for me. In the case of this and the White album in particular I've realised it's not as much to do with my repeated listening as it is with the quality of the songs. Every once in awhile it's neccessary to dust something off and listen to it with fresh ears. Otherwise all you have is the endless hype from people chiming away with their minds switched off.    It's the critics who are to blame and a horde of fans as well for the perpetuation of the Sgt. Pepper is a classic, and the best album ever scam. Part of the evidence of this is provided by the Amazon critic on this page who like all critics wants to whitewash all evidence to the contrary to prove the indestructability of the Beatles and others. No one thought of music as art? This writer was almost certainly in knee pants in 67 and probably took his music history lesson from other people who started the myth. Art and concept albums certainly did exist before then. And the Moody Blues put out a great concept album the same year. Sgt. Pepper by John's admission isn't even a real concept album. This and the 'blindingly inventive' idea of using cutouts of figures add to the hype behind this album. How can adults be so immature and excited over this? The truly clever people like Frank Zappa for instance knew right away that this was nothing special. He was even right about it being a trend. And that trend lives on today, in the nostalgia for psychedelic swirly fonts and videos. Put these tracks on another album by another band and they will be called out for the average tripe it is at best: Sgt Pepper, Rita, Good morning, Sgt. Pepper reprise.    Let's face it, these songs have been 'classic' for awhile and with that, their quality has come beyond criticism. That's not fair at all. Most of these songs have turned into a massive sing-a-long for most people. If a song is catchy, gets sung by inebriated people at bars and events, has long since passed into the culture, then it's achieved its mythic status. That's the case with this album. I've heard LSD, With a little help too many times to care anymore - they are anything but fresh. Harrison did a much better job at using eastern influences on Love you to on Revolver, this sounds far more plain and gimmicky. It's not an inventive melody in the least. The melody of Mr. Kite is a bit like It's only love from Help. Even otherwise this does not say 'classic.' This just plods along, like the rest of the album.    She's leaving home is the one redeeming song for me, the only one I hear anymore.    A day in the life - the epic. It was a huge production, has many of the ingredients of a classic. All these years later, it's a chore to listen to. I can't even say why. I just know I don't listen to it. Could it be that the Beatles stuff isn't that fresh all these years later after all? Scary thought isn't it? Nah... the critics say it's good. And Sgt. Pepper is great even though there's other music that holds up better and I would actually like listening to more if I freed up my mind.
B000002LCK|5.0|This is the first chapter in an epic power struggle between the group's rock-and-roll heart Peter Hook's melody-carrying bass and the array of computers, sequencers, and keyboards that slowly began to pile up around these erstwhile punks in the early '80's. (That's Hooky's own metaphor, cribbed from the liner notes to the Rhino edition of Technique.) This is also the collected 12-inch singles and b-sides of the first six years of existence of the greatest UK singles-artists since the Beatles, an unparalleled string of number one hits for a band who refused to do interviews, or pose for photos, or put the band name or their likenesses on their sleeves. (And were notoriously terrible live, unless magic struck...)<br /><br />As has been repeated endlessly, New Order were three-fourths of Joy Division, and the spectacularly radical course they took was in all likelihood a flight from the black hole that was self-murdered JD lead singer Ian Curtis. So in place of charismatic stage presence, NO stood for artisanal reticence; in place of dirges (even JD's fast songs were dirges, somehow), NO invented UK dance rock (saving an otherwise unredeemably bad genre by never forgetting the \\"rock\\" part -- thanks again, Hooky); in place of despair made worse by the memory of better times (Ian's lyrics hurt, and differ from other gloom-meisters, because he did not want to be like this), NO found ecstacy in the sunrise over bleak Manchester as you stagger away from the dancefloor at dawn, the drugs wearing off, not sure if that woman you fleetingly made contact with was The One, happy not even knowing her name and aware you may never see her again, a moment \\"touched by the hand of God...\\"<br /><br />The Joy Division/New Order continuum was like some weird re-enactment of Velvet Underground Mark I (the Nico-Cale Years) and Mark II (Lou Reed dominates); the first dark, unbearable beauty, the second sweetness and light underpinned by irony and melancholy.  JD covered VU Mark I's Sister Ray, NO sound like VU Mark II's \\"What Goes On,\\" \\"Beginning To See The Light,\\" and \\"Sweet Jane\\" were the only songs ever written.<br /><br />NO are the both the most- and worst- compiled band in the history of recorded music.  Their albums are pretty poor, they were born singles artists, so you would think putting a volume together would be easy; but the plethora of 7\\", 12\\", album versions and re-mixes of those singles required compilers to make tough choices, and except for Substance, the dozen or so discs of New Order compilations are marked by the wrong choices being made.  Substance benefits from being done fairly early on,so less need to make omissions, and benefits from choosing a single course and sticking to the usually superior 12\\" club versions.  I have supplemented it with \\"Singles,\\" a 2-disc collection of 7\\" A-sides only that extends the 18 years or so after Substance, and doesn't feel duplicative because the songs shared by both are radically different in 7\\" and 12\\" incarnations.  Then I picked up the really flawed 4-disc box set Retro because it has 12\\" versions of some of the post-Substance 7\\" on Singles and a decent disc of cherry-picked album cuts.  Hopefully one day they'll finally pull the trigger on an aborted box set containing every version of every single and b-side ever and be done with it.  The fact that I own a total of 8 discs of New Order anthologies and still don't possess the best version of every single is a preposterous state of affairs. Still, for NO's best, earliest, and most path-breaking and prolific  years, '81--'87 Substance is reasonably compehensive<br /><br />Anyway, this band performed the miracle of fusing the Velvet Underground, Giorgio Moroder, Kraftwerk and hook-driven rock and roll into a mechanized dance sound that is ineffable, sensuous and ecstatic.  And I hate most of the clubby wimpy druggy dance music NO gave birth to.  They caught lightning in a bottle, and this collection catches them at their world-conquering peak, as they stumbled their way to inventing their idiom, and even the mis-steps sound inspired.inventing their idiom, and even the mis-steps sound inspired.
0887307280|5.0|This is another one of those books that is in the \\"must read\\" category for chiropractors today.  Too many times I see the day to day of practice today frustrate a chiropractor to the point where they do not enjoy what they do any more.  In particular I see this with the changes in chiropractic billing to insurance companies.  This book gives a high level overview of why doctors get into this situation.  Working on your business instead of in your business is on of the best things any chiropractor can learn.  Taking that knowledge and applying it to chiropractic billing, practice management, patient care protocols is the only way this profession will take the lead as the future for the health care model.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This is one of those movies that mesmerize you.  I ended up watching the movie and then the movie with the Director's comments and again with the Actor's comments.. Beautiful story, beautifully filmed.. An overall GEM!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I loved this book.  I thought the writing was crisp and well done.  The book was funny and entertaining.  The writer is self-depracating and not at all full of herself, as others have said.  Her journey to find herself was chock full of interesting stories and characters.  I would recommend this story for people who have been around for awhile and realize how imperfect we all really are.
B001BPJJ82|5.0|The Fall is both an ode to the movie industry and a visual feast. Everything about it deserves five stars. The actors are bigger than life and pitch perfect. Handsome Lee Pace is magnetic on screen and more than holds his own against the extraodinary child find, Catinca Untaru. Director Tarsem deserves much credit for delivering a tour de force. What a vision! Colin Watkinson's photography is breath-taking. Exotic locales and costumes combine to create a tapestry that is both fantasy and easily entered. As wonderful as the film was in movie theaters, the Blu-ray edition blows it out of the water. The Special Features are treasures, too. This is a must see/must own DVD.
0307346617|5.0|This book was great! Max Brooks has a real gift for telling stories about zombies. His guide was a good read because it felt like it was a real survival guide. Now this book makes WWZ seem true. The stories you hear make it seem like, \\"Oh yeah, I remember when that happened,\\"but you know it actually didn't. The book provides great suspense and thrills as well as horror (especially for me, a person who terrified but enthralled by zombies). If you love anything that deals with Zombies, you will love this book!!
0061205699|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, written by Harper Lee, is a childhood memory told by Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch. The story begins by mentioning Jeremy \\"Jem\\" Finch's broken arm, but then takes us farther back to tell us the whole story.<br /><br />Jean Louise remembers her first day at school and bearing the unexplained wrath of her teacher. Her father, Atticus, lets her know that she'll be okay and either way she can't stop going. Jem also does his best to comfort his sister.<br /><br />Then, Jean Louise takes us to a large part of the story, summer time. Jem, Scout, and their neighbor, Dill, all make several attempts to get Boo Radley to come out of his \\"haunted\\" house. When Scout finally does meet Boo at the end of the book she finds him to be rather normal other than the extreme paleness of his skin after staying indoors all his life.<br /><br />The story then tells us of Atticus' case for Tom Robinson, a black who was accused of raping a white woman. Tom Robinson's case loses even after evidence of his inability to rape someone was shown. The jury was all white and would never let a black man win a case over even the white \\"trash\\".<br /><br />Mr. Ewell did have the satisfaction of knowing that Tom had died in a mad dash for freedom from prison. He had seen an opportunity to run and grabbed, but when he tried to vault a fence he was to slow and was shot in the back.<br /><br />But some truths were exposed of the Ewells (the family accusing him of rape), and Mr. Ewell held it against the Finches until his accidental death in which he killed himself when falling on a knife he planned to use to kill Scout and Jem finch. During his scuffle with Jem, he threw Jem at a tree and Jem's arm was shattered. This brought us to the close of Jean Louise's story.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who is considering reading it.I have heard a lot of people saying that the ending is no good, but I actually found the ending as pleasant as the rest of the book.<br /><br />The entire book teaches good morals on doing what you know to be right rather than what would be accepted better. One downfall though, Scout and Jem have an incredibly hard time obeying Atticus, but doesn't everyone have a hard time obeying their parents all the time?on doing what you know to be right rather than what would be accepted better.

What an incredible lady Ms. Satrapi is.  It gave me insights into a society and a people I would have not otherwise had.  This is in my favorites list.
B001QKSWOE|4.0|This book brought me back to being entertained by Evonovich. Her last Plum book was a terrible disappointment to me and it read like someone else wrote it for her. This sounds like Evonovich, but still relied too heavily on the same old tried and true gags that made the early books so funny, but get old after about 6 or so....food fights with the skips, incompetence bringing in her men, etc.<br /><br />I liked the fact that it was not so 'out there' with supernatural wierdness that a lot of the between the numbers books were. The men used to be so hot, and now they just seem to be all kindly adoring Plum, but we fail to see why either Plum or the guys are so steamy....<br /><br />While I would not again buy one of her books in hardcover, it was great that I could get it on the kindle for less- but the formatting for the kindle was beyond horrible....it was my first kindle read, so I thought they were all like this- then just read a pretty perfectly formatted well written book by Hart that was FREE for the kindle....so Evonovich, put some time and money into your formatting and editing too please on all platforms you sell on.
B001GZ6QDS|1.0|I found this film to be unbelievably dull. I actually nearly dozed off a few times in the theater. It was talky, slow, melodramatic, self-important and congratulatory, confusing, overwrought and just a true chore to sit through. None of the action sequences were anything I would highlight as the best of the last decade, and quite honestly there only seemed to be about 3 of them. A truck flipping over, some explosions, and Batman on his cycle were about it. We saw the best of it all in the trailers.<br /><br />It was no surprise whatsoever that Heath Ledger gained so much praise for his work in the film as he was the ONLY performer who stood out even the slightest. Christian Bale was utterly boring both as Bruce Wayne and Batman. I can't remember a single thing he did except brood like a sulky teenager. Maggie Gyllenhaal was completely unlikable as Rachel Dawes and it wasn't affecting at all to see her die. I didn't notice she was gone. Aaron Eckhardt was uninteresting as Two-Face, and I hope he did actually die at the end of the movie because he couldn't carry a whole movie on his own as a villain.<br /><br />And to be honest, while Heath Ledger did well as the Joker, I believe just about anyone would have seemed \\"brilliant\\" in the role because they would have been playing a twisted, sadistic, semi-campy character in a movie full of one-note, predictable, static characters. The Joker was the only entertaining character, the lone island in an ocean of tedious faux-realism.<br />Also, Ledger's death boosted both the reception of his performance and the movie sky high. Had he lived, the movie would likely never have garnered as much praise, and Ledger's performance would have been well-respected, but not gushed over as some sort of sheer brilliance. People inevitably do this sort of thing to artists posthumously.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is about 2 1/2 hours long, and drags the whole way through. There is no pay off in the end so don't expect it. Closure is virtually non-existent. The music is abrasive and it plays relentlessly during the many, many, many scenes of ridiculously self-important philosophical dialogue. At times you may hear the music more than what the actors are saying.<br /><br />I walked out of the theater feeling like I had been duped. This movie truly seems to be a case of the emperor's new clothes. There are miles and miles of hype, and everyone seems to agree that the \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the best thing since sliced bread. It's almost as if most people are afraid to disagree or feel as if it would be disrespectful to the late Heath Ledger to immerse this film in anything but praise.<br />But I feel that this is perhaps the single most overrated movie I have ever seen, and I eagerly await the release of the next installment in the series just to see if people are so enraptured with it with the absence of Heath Ledger. Also, by that time, I'm sure there will be several more superhero/comic book movies that bill themselves as dark, challenging, and complex so the sequel won't be able to lay claim to those themes as if they are completely original as \\"The Dark Knight\\" so tirelessly did.<br /><br />I have to say that if you take Batman out of his ultra-heavy looking costume and wiped the makeup off of the Joker's face this would be just another cop movie that thinks its smarter and more complex than it really is.s abrasive and it plays relentlessly during the many, many, many scenes of ridiculously self-important philosophical dialogue.

B000BT97AO|2.0|Freud called it the Electra Complex - the subconscious desire of every girl to kill her mother and bed her father. It's quite common, but not every day it becomes the subject of a family-oriented movie. The possessive mother is frustrating the 15-year-old Helena, who's on the verge of becoming a woman. She makes her juggle and do other childish circus things when she wants to have fun with the boys ('the real life'). Early in the movie the mother is briefly presented as a gorilla (a vary apt symbol, as Jung might have said: she gets all the bananas, and her daughter gets none). Helena causes a brain tumor of sorts in her mom, but then she becomes remorseful and wants to save her from death. She doesn't really want her dead, you see, she just needs to bypass her in order to fulfill her female 'dharma'. To do that she has to confront her dark subconscious side and get herself a boyfriend without killing her mother. Valentine is symbolically her dad: as Freud pointed out, when  a man sleeps with an older woman, he symbolically sleeps with his mom; when he does it with a younger woman, he does it with his daughter. The same goes for girls. Val is definitely older than Helena. (Also, there's a bit in which the 'good' Helena watches in horror as her 'bad', taboo-breaking half french-kisses their mutual old man). So there. Helena's mom, naturally, is not happy about her little girl trespassing into her territory. There's only so many bananas to go around. As any mother controls her son's libido (she is usually the reason why so many boys flop on their first sexual encounter with a woman), she does it even more for the girls. Helena has to neutralize her, which she does through a series of rather uninspired and unfunny adventures. In the end her mom survives, but is confined to a glass box, from which she sells tickets and blows kisses, and Helena meets the real-life Val, a waiter who wants to join the circus. Looks like they're heading for a wild weekend. Mission accomplished, what feels like two hours of someone's life wasted. This movie is unavoidably being compared with Labyrinth, but the latter is a masterpiece (despite David Bowie's \\"I'm not sure what I'm doing here\\" presence), and Mirrormask is not. Another fantasy film that explores the mother-daughter-father relationship is, of course, 10th Kingdom, and again Mirrormask can't hold a candle to it. It's not even the weak plot that irritates so much here, it's this 'Look at us, we're so quirky!' attitude of the authors. Flying books, an offended tower, some creatures called Malcolm and Bobs - all this is supposed to delight the audience, but it can appeal only to its simplest members. The heroine is devoid of any charm (remember the fantastic Jennifer Connelly in Labyrinth?), she looks even more bitchy than her mom, and I'm sure it was not the authors' intention. Val is a worthy boyfriend for her - weak, cowardly, spineless - his apology speech is just pathetic. (Although in the end he gets his 'tower' back - Dr. Jung, how is that for a symbol?)The wolf does the same thing in the 10th Kingdom - he betrays Virginia to her mother, but how much better he does it! Another recent movie comes to mind - Coraline, which is as visually stunning and as moronic story-wise - but at least in the end Helena gets more than a pair of colourful mittens.

I told myself it would never happen, but I was wrong. I've had it for a short time but it has saved me more than once having the spare battery. Don't be an idiot like me, buy one for back-up.
B000003N7Y|4.0|Coming hard on the heels of the album that many feel is Mingus's masterpiece, The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady, this album takes a ten piece little big band and reprises several of Mingus' most well known compositions and was recorded in January and September of 1963. Joining the great bassist and composer are several jazz luminaries like Eric Dolphy and Charlie Mariano on alto saxophone, Jaki Byard on piano, Booker Ervin on tenor saxophone, and Dannie Richmond on drums. \\"Better Get Hit In Yo' Soul\\" is one of the most rollicking themes in the Mingus canon and it gets a rousing treatment here with propulsive saxophone riffing and Mingus urging the musicians to go higher, faster and stronger. Written to honor the great saxophonist, \\"Theme for Lester Young\\" is a remake of Mingus' famous Pres tribute \\"Goodbye Porkpie Hat.\\" It's a mournful and touching performance that hints at Young's famous style of laid back swing. Mingus' idol was always Duke Ellington and and the group makes fine tribute to him with a beautiful performance of one of Ellington's most famous songs, \\"Mood Indigo.\\" Most fascinating is the previously unreleased \\"Freedom\\" which has a chain gang rhythm while Mingus recites a spoken word passage about the search for freedom in America and the Civil Rights movement. It is one of the most powerful of the great man's spoken pieces, ranking with \\"Fables of Faubus\\" for emotional resonance. This is a truly fine Mingus album, one of the last ones before he would spend a period in the wilderness due to lack of a record contract and personal problems. Mingus leads a great band though excellent music, and this should on no account be missed.
B000P12LWY|2.0|I have long had an interest in monarchy and court intrigues. I started watching this show in the hopes that it would provide an entertaining look at history, much like HBO's Rome. Comparing this series to Rome is more or less inevitable given the times they were released and the direction they take the plot. Rome featured interesting plots, well developed characters, detailed costumes, and graphic sex. The Tudors really only notices the last two. The first episode plays out like someone was looking over a checklist to make sure he had a sex scene every twenty minutes.    The casting for the main characters is screwed up as well. We have Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Henry, a man who was historically known for his red hair, great height, and strong physique. Meyers has none of these traits, being lithe, dark haired, and of average height.   He is also too young for the role. He and Anne Boleyn are portrayed as being roughly the same age, despite Henry being 20 years her senior historically.   Henry comes off  more like a spoiled, horny jock then a man with varied intellectual and physical pursuits. He spends almost all his screen time in the series sleeping around, hunting, jousting, and feasting. When he isn't in his \\"party hardy\\" mode, he's yelling like a toddler that doesn't want to go to bed. I didn't think for a moment that this could be a Renaissance man who wrote theological tomes, composed his own music, and wrote volumes of poetry.  I am not sure whether he or the writers are to blame for the portrayal of Henry, but I'm sure there are many actors out there that could have utilized more then two emotions in their performance. Myers is not one of them.     Natalie Dormer plays Anne Boleyn. Anne was noted for her olive skin, and dark eyes. Natalie Dormer, while gorgeous, has neither of these traits.   Maria Doyle Kennedy plays Catherine of Aragon. Catherine was described as blonde and pink skinned, so naturally her TV counterpart has dark hair and pale skin.Such obvious casting errors could have been avoided with such esoteric devices as contact lenses and hair dye. With all the money they spent on costumes, props, sets, and actresses who would take their clothes off, surely they could have splurged a little to ensure the actors looked like the people they're supposed to be portraying.    It gets worse, however. There are numerous minor characters, but anyone not intimately familiar with Tudor history will probably never remember their names. There's the guy who took a lance to the face, the guy who slept with the other guy, and the guy with the girly voice who slept with the guy I mentioned after the guy that took a lance to the face.     If this seems confusing to you, imagine watching a show where the characters have such a lack of distinguishing traits, instead of simply reading about it. They seemingly exist to facilitate more sex scenes, as Myers can't be everywhere. Some die, some disappear, only a few make any difference plotwise.    However, I must give credit where it's due. Jeremy Northam and Sam Niell give excellent performances as Thomas More and Cardinal Wolsey.   Northam portrays Thomas More as a decent man who is forced both by the times and by his beliefs to do some things he finds disturbing.    Sam Niell draws a nice transition from arrogance and desperation, as he finds his formerly dominant position in court challenged by his enemies, namely the Boleyns. Despite the fact that the Fall of Cardinal Wolsey doesn't really provide many opportunities for nudity, they do it fairly well when they can be bothered to pay attention to it.    If the same detail had been lavished on the minor characters, this show would have been a much better one. However, that probably would have left less room for the pointless sex, and we just can't have that can we?

0307346617|4.0|(Today's review will take on a different form.  Not content to merely give you a few paragraphs about whether or not I liked the book and why, I have decided to so something a bit more dramatic.)<br /><br />Kaylia sits on the couch, legs curled up underneath her, reading.  From the kitchen sounds of cooking carry though the small apartment; Matthew is cooking.<br /><br />Scott flops down in the easy chair and regards the woman on the couch with apathy until he notices what she is reading.<br /><br />\\"Oh! World War Z?\\"<br /><br />She glances up, \\"Yeah, almost done.'<br /><br />`Are you enjoying it?\\"<br /><br />She pauses, one eyebrow raised ever so slightly and seems to give the question serious thought for a moment.<br /><br />\\"No, not really.'<br /><br />Scott is mildly surprised having read the book himself a few months back and having enjoyed it immensely.  \\"Really? I read it a while a go and I really liked it.'<br /><br />She shrugs, years of being a Lit major has taught her many things, the most important one being that people can have lousy taste in books, although in this case, that wasn't exactly the case.<br /><br />\\"Well,\\" she marks her place with a well trained eye and then turns to give him 90% of her attention (10% being saved for the sounds of cooking coming from the kitchen). \\"I do plan on finishing it, I am glad I am reading it, and I am very interested in it, but it is a horror book and I can't really say that I am enjoying it. If you know what I mean.\\"<br /><br />He leans forward intrigued, `What do you mean?'<br /><br />\\"Like I said, it is a horror book... (not really my thing) and it is supposed to be scary and disturbing and such...

I think that the background of this horrible catastrophe is silly (I mean really, zombies?) but the way people react to the zombies.. the cruelty, the insanity, the military mistakes, the random very human moments, all that is very on the nose.

0618918248|5.0|I am a very devout \\"Born Again Atheist\\" - with fairly hard core opinions about the fallacy of religion.  I have been a guest speaker for numerous humanist organizations [...]    Of all the books I've read on religion, atheism, philosophy, science - this is the only one that I've completely agreed with 100%.  He does a very good job of looking at all sides of most of the standard arguments, picking them apart from every angle. But he has many new ways of looking at things, with exemplary explanations and impeccable logic to back up his conclusions.    My only complaint is that some of the early chapters could be edited down, the point could be made much more simply. But overall, it's an engaging, well written, and exceptionally thought provoking book. The world needs more people who think for themselves, and this is a great book to get them started.
B001NFNFIK|4.0|In the Electric Mist marks legendary French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier's first North American-made motion picture and, based on the troubles he encountered while making it, perhaps his last. Tavernier, a big fan of American crime fiction (he previously adapted Jim Thompson's [[ASIN:0679732497 Pop. 1280]] into [[ASIN:B000059H7Q Coup de Torchon - Criterion Collection]]), jumped at the chance to bring James Lee Burke's bestselling novel [[ASIN:0752810650 In the Electric Mist with Confederate Dead]] to the big screen. However, reports surfaced that Tavernier and the film's star, Tommy Lee Jones, did not get along, and the producers were not happy with the director's version. As a result, the version released on DVD in North America is the producers' cut and not Tavernier's.<br /><br />Tavernier does an excellent job capturing the local color of the area in the scenes where protagonist Dave Robicheaux (Tommy Lee Jones) canvases the locals. The entire film was shot on location and this only enhances the authenticity of the story's setting which is rich in atmosphere - also helped by the liberal use of blues and zydeco music. The cinematography has a textured quality to it that really brings out the lushness of the region.<br /><br />The cast is outstanding with Tommy Lee Jones doing his patented gruff yet savvy lawman, Peter Sarsgaard portraying a boozy actor, and John Goodman as a scene-stealing mobster with a genial facade that barely masks a threatening demeanor. The cast is rounded out by fascinating veteran character actors like Mary Steenburgen, Pruitt Taylor Vince and Ned Beatty.<br /><br />Despite the production and post-production problems that plagued the film, this version is engaging and entertaining but one still wonders what Tavernier's original cut is like.<br /><br />Sadly, the only special features are a theatrical trailer but considering the bad blood between director and the producers this is hardly suprising.
0345451325|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was incredible to say the least. No only do you learn the origins of the Spartan program, all the way up to its utter downfall. But your presented with a dynamic range of characters, an incredible story, and beautifully animated actions scenes. The scope of the story is spectacular and epic. I was blown away by each page, from the introduction of the Spartan program, to the epic battles that end the book. These books are good enough to exist without the games, and I'm so happy they were written. The only bad thing about these books is that once you start reading them you will not be able to stop. I read the entire book in two days - a bit much if you ask me.
1400064287|4.0|Recommended for writers, educators, and marketers, this was a great little read about how to make your ideas stickier.      I am a fan of the Malcolm Gladwell / Freakonomics style prose: heavy on quirky anomaly, counterintuitive insight, and compelling narratives. However, I often found myself wishing there were more science and applicability behind the writing.      'Made to Stick' took the best elements of those books and created a how-to guide that has broad applicability in professional life.  With this book I was immediately able to put its techniques into use in a marketing campaign that I was creating.       Definitely worth the read.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Two of Hollywood's greatest leading men, Robert Deniro and Al Pacino, are detectives Turk and Rooster, respectively.  They are partners and best friends.  Together, they are investigating a serial killer who has decided to mete out his own brand of vigilante justice.  Criminals who have gone free on technicalities are being shot by an expert marksman; poems are being found on their corpses.  Who is the poetic serial killer?  Could it be a cop?  The answer will shock you.<br /><br />  Fans of horror and action thrillers alike will love \\"Righteous Kill.\\"  Thanks to the gory, shocking murders that compose a high body count, the pacing is fast.  Also, some of the victims were genuinely corrupt and the viewer will tend to sympathize with the serial killer.  Is the killer truly righteous in disposing of these criminals?  We also cheered Charles Bronson in the classic \\"Death Wish\\" and Jodie Foster in \\"The Brave One\\" when they relentlessly pursued the criminals who had killed their loved ones.<br /><br />  Planting false evidence and killing criminals who have escaped justice have been themes of past vigilante films.  Michael Douglas was a judge in \\"The Star Chamber,\\" which was a vigilante organization contracting hit men to kill criminals.  Charles Bronson is found guilty of planting evidence on a serial killer in \\"10 To Midnight;\\" he later pursues the serial killer himself after three more young women are stabbed to death at his daughter's dormitory.<br /><br />  As long as there is a justice system that favors the criminal over the victim, there will be movies like \\"Righteous Kill.\\"  They represent a society that feels frustrated and hopeless because criminals are not receiving the punishments that they deserve.<br /><br />  Kudos to Anchor Bay Entertainment for a superb DVD presentation of \\"Righteous Kill.\\"  Great direction from Jon Avnet, a top notch cast, plenty of suspense, and a sad, provocative finale make it essential viewing for fans of the vigilante genre.
B00005JPS8|5.0|Iron Man is a superhero film that bucks a great many conventions.  The hero is somewhat less-than-virtuous particularly at the start, and has what appear to be almost crippling flaws.  A violent encounter with enemies armed with his own weapons wakes his ethical mind up as well as his engineering talent.  He is a hero out to right a wrong that was done by that which he was responsable...weapons manufactured by his own company in the hands of violent, vicious people.  The change he goes through is entertaining and gradual...you don't really get any superheroics until about halfway through (unless you count his spectacular escape).  Best of all, the final line of the film throws one of the most cherished traditions of superheroes out the window entirely...and it's all the better because it's so in character for the new Tony Stark.<br />As shiny as The Dark Knight was dark, Iron Man is an excellent entry into the superhero genre.

I saw that the book had gotten good reviews and many have purchased it.<br /><br />I looked through it before gifting it to her, and it appears to be a book aimed at those who have a basic understanding of makeup. If you are just starting to take an interest in high-end makeup and would like to get comfortable using quality makeup, this is a good book.<br /><br />For more outlandish, exotic types of makeup application, I would pair this book with one geared more towards intense eyeshadow instruction.<br /><br />Some great tips are in the book, though. I am fairly experienced and I learned some new tips!

B001AQO3WY|5.0|I've been watching David Simon shows since Homicide so I guess you can call me a fan. Honestly, after The Wire, I needed a little break from him so I consciously decided not to watch Generation Kill when it aired on HBO but when holiday season rolled around and I had time to sit and watch a mini-series in its entirety, I decided to go ahead and just buy GK. I've heard some lukewarm reviews (some having to do with the casting, others involving \\"what really goes on in combat\\", and others still... involve the lack of action) but I really loved this show and can't say enough about it.    If you're expecting some shoot-em-up style show, then you don't know David Simon. It's definitely dialogue-based with long moments or action, suspense, and pretty graphic scenes (if you can't handle someone getting shot in the eye and seeing it, this is probably not the show for you). It takes about 2 episodes to really get into the characters because of the ensemble cast (which is another David Simon idiosyncrasy). Even as a fan of some of the actors, it took me a minute to distinguish them (especially Alexander Skarsgard and Stark Sands who look nothing alike in real life) but again, if you watched The Wire or Homicide, you know you're just going to be dumped into a situation that is already happening and no one's going to hold your hand. But once you get a handle on the complex characters, it's a fantastic show; great acting, beautifully shot, incredible sound design, and an interesting perspective on the war.    I don't know how I would have felt if I had to wait a week between episodes. I know a lot of people who \\"didn't like it\\" after only watching the first episode. Like I said, it took me a minute to distinguish the characters/actors so as far as the DVDs go, I recommend watching at least the first 2 episodes back to back. But it's definitely worth it.
B0011V9XT6|4.0|The overall quality of Beyonce Experience Live is absolutely amazing. Well, there still some minor problem with the cameras.

B000E1155E|4.0|I debated whether to give this album the full five stars--I like it that much.  It has a great, raw post-punk feel that was subsequently lost in Favorite Worst Nightmare, and that is not a good thing in my view.  I think Arctic Monkeys, all of the hype surrounding them aside, are the best of the new British bands.  They have a great tongue-in-cheek style and aren't as monotonous as bands like Franz Ferdinand.  I highly recommend.

We don't realize that the railroad was very powerful and had government backing in that day. They were very ruthless and this story is very believable.   You also have to remember the railroad linked the country together which brought us where we are today.   If you want to watch a piece of history, you will enjoy this movie. I would not let kids watch it. They probably wouldn't want to anyway.  Great actors, great acting, great western!

B001O2ZW1A|5.0|Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson continues to create what is a musical world unto itself.  His highly crafted music evokes images and moods; it is at once powerful and colorful, and often contains tension.  Throughout Wilson's career he has pushed his own limits, exploring progressive rock and other musical forms with Porcupine Tree, with his side projects such as Blackfield, and now with his solo album \\"Insurgentes\\".    What makes \\"Insurgentes\\" such a great disc?     With \\"Veneno Para Los Hadas\\" Wilson quotes both Pink Floyd and earlier Porcupine Tree (\\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\").  In \\"No Twilight Within the Courts of the Sun\\" he evokes mid-Seventies King Crimson right down to the vocals and the drumming in places, but throws that mix into the 21st century.  The obvious musical references are done extremely well, but what demonstrates the genius of \\"Insurgentes\\" is when Wilson quotes from his own Porcupine Tree catalog and it stands with the other bigger-name influences you will hear.  While this is undoubtedly not his intent, \\"Insurgentes\\" demonstrates that Wilson's music is some of the very best of its kind.          To hear some early Porcupine Tree influences, check out how \\"Harmony Korine\\" echoes \\"Even Less\\" from Porcupine Tree's magnificent \\"Stupid Dream\\" CD from 1999.  Musically, you might also hear a bit of \\"Radioactive Toy\\" in \\"Salvaging\\".  Then again, this album's title track (basically a solo piano track with bass koto accompaniment and studio treatment) is something unto itself, as are the wonderfully strange instrumental \\"Twilight Coda\\" and instrumental passages in \\"Get What You Deserve\\".    With \\"Insurgentes\\" Wilson plays most of the instrumental parts, but has some friends along for the ride.  Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison is present on much of the album, and Wilson has invited master bassist Tony Levin on board for a few tracks.  Dream Theater's keyboardist Jordan Rudess is outstanding on three tracks.  One guest highlight is the backing vocalsby Clodagh Simmonds on the wonderful \\"Significant Other\\"; that is a very fine track, but her presence really makes it fly.           Steven Wilson and his musical endeavors deserve whatever attention they get, because there are not many musicians today who put the time, care and attention to detail into their works as he does.  Whether you are a fan of Porcupine Tree's material prior to their major label debut with \\"In Absentia\\", a fan of the band's more recent material, or just a Porcupine Tree/Steven Wilson fan in general... there is something on this disc for you.    And if you are unfamiliar?  Well... let's just say Wilson and Porcupine Tree have one of music's greatest treasure chests of the last 15 years!  If you like creative/prog sounds and have not heard this music, lifting the lid may open a whole new world for you!  Warning:  this stuff is all so good that it is quite easy to get hooked.  One Wilson/Porcupine Tree album will inevitably lead you to another.    But this is how it should be!        So download this CD now, or rush out and buy a copy.  You will not be disappointed.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|\\"Is that a sitar?  What? The riff is being passed around?  It's turning into the chord progression?\\"    This is what I thought when I heard the brilliant opener \\"Life in Technicolor II.\\" Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends is, in every respect, a fantastic album, but Prospekt's March surpasses it in every way.     Life in Technicolor II, Glass of Water, Rainy Day, and Prospekt's March are worth it alone, but the inclusion of a remix of Lovers in Japan, which is fantastic, and the beautiful finisher \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\" is a great bonus.    Prospekt's March is, I hope, forshadowing to Coldplay's next album. The wind chimes on Glass of Water when the chorus stampedes in is relieving and beautiful, almost Cure-esque. The song is relentlessly gorgeous, with synth and guitars leaving no emptiness to be heard.    I can't reccomend Prospekt's March any more to whoever is reading this. If you're a fan of the band, you are probably already enjoying the album. If you're just getting into Coldplay, Prospekt's March and Viva La Vida... are both fantastic ways to break the ice.

The main character, Zoey, age 16, is a smart young woman whose fairly normal high school life is completely disrupted when she is marked as a potential vampire. The tattoo-like crescent moon mark on her forehead means that she immediately needs to get to the House of Night, the boarding school for fledgling vampires, otherwise she will die.<br /><br />Her mother does not understand, and against Zoey's wishes turns for help to her husband, Zoey's \\"step-loser\\", a religious fanatic who blames and accuses Zoey of bad behavior. He refuses to believe that Zoey is in any danger even as she grows more and more ill.

She meets a gorgeous smart guy who she has an immediate connection with. The campus where she will be living for the next few years as she grows into an adult vampire is beautiful and luxurious. Neferit, her beautiful adult mentor, seems to understand her intuitively which helps soothe the pain of her mother's betrayal. The Zoey and her fellow vampire fledglings have a lot of freedom which they can't really abuse because the adult vampires running the show always know if they break the rules.<br /><br />Zoey finds that she has some powers that make her special even in this exotic setting. Her connection with the goddess Nyx, the goddess of vampires, guides her as she encounters a group of nasty girls who form a prestigious clique. Fortunately she makes some new friends who are smart, fun and supportive.

Zoey is a likeable character who struggles with normal teen issues such as dealing with old and new boyfriends, her hurtfully clue-less parents, trying to fit in and who to trust, and balancing the parts of her life that are maturing faster than she feels ready for. Zoey also learns about her spirituality and how that influences her decisions and lifestyle.<br /><br />The Cast's are fairly competent writers that create a compelling story and characters.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|I heard about this show and watched it online (sidereel.com) expecting to hate it, but I must admit that it sucked me in and forced me to watch it! Was it the handsome Elliot Cowan sizzling around as Darcy, the spunky if misguided heroine, or the unpredictable plot twists caused by a modern Austen fan bumbling through the world she'd only dreamed of? I can't be sure, but I have to say that I couldn't wait to see where the story would go next. Is it ridiculous? Absolutely. Will you feel foolish trying to describe it to your seriously literary friends? Believe it. Will you be embarrassingly hooked on it and want to see it again? Maybe. Whenever I engaged my brain I felt like I was watching some pretty crazy fan fiction, but nonetheless watch it I did. While some may find it a hack job that butchers their favorite book, it seemed to me more of a musing on the idea of what would it REALLY be like to be in this world so many of us like to read about. I will admit I wasn't crazy about the ending, but I don't want to put up a spoiler. So my final analysis is that I didn't really admire it but I did enjoy watching it. UPDATE: I ordered the dvd from Amazon and am pleased with my purchase. I did find the dvd at a local bookstore, but the price was double Amazon's, so I recommend getting it here, folks. The dvd contained two extras: an interesting \\"making of\\" feature and a trailer. I did notice that the dvd version was edited differently than the version I saw on sidereel, namely the loss of a scene where the heroine sings the 60's pop song \\"Downtown.\\" That was a bummer. I can't say what else may be different, but apparently this version isn't exactly the same as what was broadcast in the UK. That being said, it's a good buy for a fun movie that comes in at about 3 hours, so that's two movie nights at my house! (The dvd version is not separated into episodes.)And the movie looks much lovelier on my tv than it did on my little computer screen. The colors and sets are very nice, and Elliot Cowan is a very handsome Darcy indeed!and Elliot Cowan is a very handsome Darcy indeed!
0393324818|4.0|The book begins with the question: \\"How did one of the poorest teams in baseball, the Oakland Athletics, win so many games?\\" At the opening of the 2002 season, the richest team, the N.Y. Yankees, had a payroll of $126 million, while the two poorest teams, the Oakland A's and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, had payrolls of about $40 million each. Yet, for the past several years the A's won more regular season games than any other, except the Atlanta Braves.<br /><br />The impetus for change came from rapidly escalating player salaries after free-agency, and the increased availability of data and ease of using it.<br /><br />Side Note: Steinbrenner paid only $10 million for the entire Yankee team in 1973 - far less than many individual players now receive in a single year.<br /><br />Lewis makes it clear that it's hard to pinpoint when innovative statistical analysis began to change baseball - efforts began decades before the A's innovations, but never really caught on.  This was partly due to limited data availability and engrained traditions. The key enabler was Sandy Alderson, an attorney with no baseball background, becoming 1990 general manager of the Athletics. Alderson recognized the lack of hard evidence for most coaching and recruiting ploys - probably via the numerous conflicting strategies. His early conclusions from others' data was that obtaining walks was an important, underused strategy. A second key step was recognizing that Billy Beane, A's scout, had grown tired of traditional recruiting, believing it highly imprecise and was looking for a new approach. (This may partly have been due to how he was aggressively recruited out of high school, but failed to do well.) Thus, he Billy Beane replaced Alderson when he left the A's, and in turn hired Paul DePodesta, a Harvard graduate with an economics major and a record of innovative baseball analyses.<br /><br />Side Note 2: Lewis also explained the baseball recruiting and free-agency system. A team that drafts and signs a player holds the rights to his first 7 years in the minors and first 6 in the majors. Exception: The second 3 years of a big-league player could be subject to salary arbitration. The rules also granted first-round draft-picks for each top round player \\"poached\\" (outbid) by other teams, and another \\"compensation\\" pick at the end of the first round.<br /><br />Beane's new scouting approach dumped almost all high school players from consideration - college players were much more likely to succeed. Also quickly dumped were those looking for sizable pay. Foot speed, fielding ability, and raw power were found to be dramatically overpriced; the ability to control the strike zone (draw walks, not swing at bad pitches) was found to the greatest indicator of future success.<br /><br />Excellent insights!s to his first 7 years in the minors and first 6 in the majors.

140120841X|5.0|Do read this book! Classic Alan Moore, and sooooo much fun. It's really hard to put down. Much more straightforward than his other material, in my opinion, but sometimes much more exciting to read. Set in the near future (now the near past) when post-WWII societies have turned to fascism after a nuclear apocalypse in which the UK was one of the only survivors. Put your thinking cap on and have a go!

B00005JNX0|3.0|I have two elementary age boys who wanted to see this film at the theater and then asked for the dvd. So I have seen it both at the theater and at home, but I really don't care for it. My kids thought it was quite funny, but I would place it in the bottom tier of kids' movies. The animation is fine and parts are amusing but nothing is really stellar. The story is run-of-the-mill, and too many cliches make it a bit tiresome. Chris Rock, in my opinion, just has a funny voice, so I laughed whenever his character spoke. The highlight of the movie is the penguins. As a paramilitary group intent on breaking out of the zoo and heading to Antarctica, they steal the show. The lemurs (or were they meerkats?) on the island of Madagascar have some laughs as well, but on the whole, this is not my favorite kids' movie. I recommend you rent it first before you buy.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|I maybe bias...lol but I love Denzel and this movie.      Denzel and Russel Crowe bring the characters to life in this movie. It is action packed crime thriller that will keep you hanging on from the moments the credits come on until they go off.
B00000IACG|5.0|Instrument Soundtrack is one of those rare albums that is complete from beginning to end - like one long song. The whole album is perfect and the atmosphere remains unbroken, even when left to repeat for several days at a time, which is what I usually do (in the car).      Funny, it never occurred to me that these songs were incomplete demos. I received this as a gift some years ago and didn't know anything about it at the time. Since then it's become one of my all-time favorite albums. I knew Fugazi from the 13 Songs and Repeater albums, but Instrument was actually my first to own by them. I will definitely say this is not your Fugazi starter album if you are looking for the sound that made them popular, but it may become your favorite album if, like me, you come to appreciate their phenomenal growth and evolution.     If you are a fan then you should get this. You don't need me to tell you that. This is a good record.     If you don't care about Fugazi but are interested in a unique original sound that is completely introspective and unpretentious, then you might want to give this one a try. Your money could be supporting worse efforts than this one. It's a little raw, has few vocals, and uses actual instruments as the title suggests. I hope I'm not too far out on a limb by suggesting that the term \\"ambient\\" could apply here. But forget ambient in the new age sense.
B00030590I|1.0|Scenario and showmanship are good and entertaining, if you can overlook that people walk on water, walls, and fly around.  The storyline is schizophrenic and nonsensical. I got frustrated waiting for an end that took too long to come.<br />SPOILER ALERT:<br />No sequel here, everybody dies. Some several times.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille is that rare animated film that kids love but seems more for adults. Let's face it, most kids' interest in dining stops at McDonald's, so a film about the goings-on in the kitchen of an elegant Paris restaurant doesn't sound like it would get kids to come running. But the humor and the funny talking rats pull my kids right in, and my husband and I really like this movie as well. The story follows a rat named Remy with the unlikely dream of being a chef. Rats in the kitchen is pretty much always a bad thing, so Remy has some work to do to make his dream a reality. Enter Linguini, the hapless garbage boy, who, with Remy's help, seems to be the next big thing in fine dining. The action in the film is fast-paced and the animation is fabulous, so it's a treat for the eyes. The movie is directed by Brad Bird, the genius who brought us The Incredibles, so nothing about this movie seems cliche. It's a unique movie that kids will love although it's about a subject that kids probably don't care much about.
B00005RHGK|4.0|This movie is Erie and Creepy.  I can't go down the expressway without looking at a ricket old truck sideways now...lol    My daughter thought it was just alright but I really liked the movie and would watch it again. Glad I have it in my collection!
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|There are several great character moments in this movie, and the pacing does move the story along well enough. However there is a bit too much political posturing for my taste, which, as I see it, is one of the big things contributing to making this movie play out like a big-budget, big-screen episode of the TV show.<br /><br />Of course, there is also the lack of feel of galactic scope or personal investment in the story. The scope of Star Trek II was narrow: Khan's revenge. But the audience had personal investment in the characters from the episode \\"Space Seed\\". Star Trek IV had the impending destruction of Earth. VI had galactic peace looming in the horizon. First Contact had the assimilation of Earth by the Borg and Picard's personal quest to \\"make them pay\\". Here, we have a people on an alien planet facing the possibility of forced relocation. Nobody we've met before besides the crew. Nothing that has immediate repercussion for Earth.<br /><br />To be fair, it was specifically designed to balance out the very dark tone of the previous movie with much more light fare. On that level, it does work. The nature of the Star Trek movies is that they are all different adventures that are placed in the same universe. The tone can change, since it does that on the TV series from episode to episode. But the story still needs to resonate with the audience.<br /><br />Again, the crew has some nice character moments, and the special effects are actually quite well done, but those are not what Star Trek movies are built around. They're necessary elements, but the audience wants a ride they care about.<br /><br />In the end, it is competently made and it is worth watching. Just know that it was, by design, a much lighter fare than First Contact.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|In order to enjoy Saw you have to start with the first one.  I like that each Saw is really connected verses many series where it is all new characters and plots.<br /><br />With the Saw series you will see how they layer each film and how they are all connected!<br /><br />Bottom line great movie!
B000A6T1KE|3.0|There are good action sequences here, many with tenuous reasons behind them. The special effects are done well enough. The story had the promise of galactic scope and great import to the audience. But there aren't nearly enough true character moments or Star Trek level humor to carry this one off in the minds of the viewers. True, Picard and Data have a lot of \\"character moments\\" where they get introspective and philosophical, but since those moments are brought out merely as the story forces them to re-evaluate their lives, they are more plot element than character points.<br /><br />One of the elements that contributes to the problems with this movie is the fact that it is directed by Stuart Baird, a film editor and a Star Trek neophyte. Granted, this is not the first time Star Trek has used \\"less experienced\\" directors. Star Treks III, V, Generations, and First Contact were all directed by people who were doing their first ever feature film, and Star Trek II was only Nicholas Meyer's second directorial outing ever. So lack of directorial experience is not necessarily insurmountable, but it is not encouraging.<br /><br />Also, Nicholas Meyer too was a Star Trek neophyte when brought on to direct II. However he delved into Star Trek to better understand it and realistically portray it on screen. In contrast, Baird reportedly reveled in his lack of Star Trek knowledge and insisted on simply making the movie he wanted.<br /><br />The script was written by John Logan, a Star Trek fan and the writer of the screenplays for \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Any Given Sunday\\" and \\"The Aviator\\". So the story should have worked better than it ultimately does. There is a great movie to be made here out of this story. But it just doesn't satisfy like it should. (Me, I blame the director.)<br /><br />If you want to watch a Star Trek movie, go with II, VI or First Contact. Only watch this one if you want an action movie with a Star Trek theme.
0780631684|5.0|This movie kept me on the edge of my seat.  It made me think about fate and death all while making me scream and squrim in my seat.    Bottom line this was a great movie...One of the new classics!

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Planet Earth in any venue is fabulous; but in Blu-ray, the visuals are truly beyond words, containing views of our planet that most of us will never see in  our lifetimes. The message? This is a special place of incredible structure and balance where each plant and animal and insect works with and is in harmony with all the other beings in its individual environment, and that we all must do whatever we can to honor and respect our beautiful, incomparable home.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I loved it. I waited six or seven years for this Rocky masterpiece to come out, and it was all worth it. I love when they play the original theme during his training and running up the stairs with Punchie. (His dog.) I loved all the Adrian and Mickey flashbacks. I also loved the fight toward the end with Rocky and Mason, showing that Rocky could still go toe-to-toe, so people who want him to win, you might be disappointed, but hard-core fans who love Rocky and see that he still has it, you'll love it. Also, I thought the fight was too short, but it was still great. I highly recommend ROCKY BALBOA!!!
B001P3SA8U|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it. It tells the stories of some of the artists (like Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters) and there time spent with Lenney Chess and chess records. the only thing that the movie dosent rely touch on if i remember right is that lenny chess had a brother who also worked and chess, and there was no mention of him in the movie. the music is great, and the jokes are funny, if you get the context, like when the guy at the bar asks chuck berry for his ID and he pulls his poster off the wall and he says \\"ok, ID\\"
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This was a fabulous CD. After watching the movie I wanted to purchase the soundtrack from this movie. The actors had fantastic voices, especially M. Streep which surprised me. I am totally thrilled at this soundtrack and would recommend it highly.  Suzanne Fuqua
B001BKVWYG|5.0|A friend suggested that I check Rodriguez out, and I have already passed in along to at least 3 other friends.  This album is something special, and it's been out since the early 70's.  His story is interesting and that makes the songs that much more so. I love this album.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|When I first saw the prieview for this movie.I was so excited and couldn't wait to see.But when I saw this movie in theaters I didn't get what I expected.It was better than I though it would be.I almost pissed myself when I saw all the humor in it.But I expected this to be Clint Eastwood's best moviue ever.But it wasn't.But it was number 2.I thought Million dollar baby was his best movie ever made.Not to mention Changeling which was also really good.Especially the twist at the ending.Can't forget the the Dirty Harry series.I['ve been a Clint Eastwood fan for not long but a few months ago I was hooked on his movies.I forgot to mention Leters from Iwo Jima and Flags of our fathers.2 other classics.For how short I've been a fan I've learned that if it comes from Clint Eastwood it does not dissappoint.Accept for the failure comedies like every which way but loose and the sequel also bronco billy.Not some of Clint's best movies but they were okay.I didnm't care for them very much.But Clint Eastwood is unbeatble in making the perfect film.( and yes Steven Spielberg isn't as good but hes still good.)
B000ZN802W|5.0|A tremendous amount of favorable reviews and some resentful responses depicts the power of this quiet movie, affecting so many who have watched it. Unfolding in bits and pieces, this movie is a journey not just across the land and seasons, but a journey of the heart, a seeking of something to heal the soul of wounds left behind, a coming of age in spirit, far more than in body. Wide open spaces, rich in characters, & chilling in the need to survive, this movie strikes deeply in the heart of so many people longing for something more in their lives.
0380804557|3.0|This book stands out as one of the very few examples where I liked the movie BETTER than the book. For some reason, it fell somewhat flat to me. The story is charming, but translated to film much better in my opinion.<br /><br />I read this immediately after finishing American Gods, and believe me... it was something of a letdown!
B0013FSL3E|4.0|This is a fun movie. But it also sends some very strong messages about our waste and laziness. Our family truly enjoyed it, and yours will too.

1439102813|5.0|I'm 57 years old and sometimes forget things, especially names of actors, sometimes I can't quite come up with the right word, like I couldn't think of the word \\"modest\\" the other day.  And so, reading this book about dementia was very enjoyable and insightful, even though it paints a painful picture of the reality.  I loved the first person perception of what's going on, for example, when she first gets lost near her home.  It was so well written I almost wondered if the author had had many of these experiences herself, scared and adrenaline producing moments.  I loved the way she created notes for herself, the butterfly note was absolutely excellent and heart breaking,<br /><br />And yet, as she enters deeper into the disease, there is the love of her family and the bonding with her wayward actress daughter, the birth of grandchildren, and her continued relationship \\"with the man who owns the home\\"  and the story ended up giving me a peaceful feeling, that she is dying slowly, surrounded by those who love her and can take care of her, and it's OK, almost better than dying from something like a painful cancer.<br /><br />And I also walked away realizing it's time to focus on my own mental and physical health.<br /><br />Lovingly and brilliantly written story.

0312427999|5.0|Klein gives us her take on what she has termed 'Disaster Capitalism'. Its epicentre is the Chicago Business School & the main Apostle, Prof. Milton Friedman. Friedman's primary philosophy was that pure capitalism, unfettered by any government intervention should determine the market. The best way to precipitate the environment to enact pure capitalism was to 'shock' a nation's populace through crises. The changes would be made while the nation, disoriented & in pain, is too pre-occupied to notice. The core principal of Disaster Capitalism is to profit from crises, chaos & destruction.<br /><br />You are given a history lesson in Latin American economics or more accurately, US economic policy in Latin America beginning in the 1950's. The context for 'Disaster Capitalism' is well defined as Klein decribes its evolution through the exploition and generation of crises in nations like Chile, Argentina & Bolivia.<br /><br />We see America's role in the installation of the cruel dictator, Augusto Pinochet & the true motivation behind the abuse, torture & 'disappearing' of many of Chile's citenzenry: to make wholesale changes to the nations economic structure by privatizing its industries & dismantling its unions & most importantly, selling the nation off to Western interests.<br /><br />These 'experiments' are repeated around Latin America & the World, and have specific characteristics: violence, removal of civil liberties, dictatorship & the presence of Friedman's disciples known as 'The Chicago Boys'. The evolving 'Shock Doctrine' spreads to the Far East & Eastern Europe &, along the way, is supported by the creation & operation of the World Bank & the IMF. The IMF, after reporting erroneous figures that erode confidence in target nations economies resulting in withdrawal of investments, then offers much needed financial aid - but upon the condition that essential industries are privatized usually by interests from the nations upon which the World Bank & IMF are founded.<br /><br />Along with the concept of Disaster Capitalism Klein also introduces a few other ideas, among them 'Economic Apartheid': the segregation of society into rich & poor, citizens & corporations exemplified by pre & post Katrina New Orleans & Post-Tsunami Sri Lanka. She efficiently illustrates the aggressive marginalization of poorer local communities in favour of large, usually multi-national corporations & the social, economic & physical/geographical dislocation that results.<br /><br />The historic background may be familiar to some, but Klein's master stroke is to draw a line from the 1950's to present day Iraq & the Bush administration. It is implied that the Shock Doctrine & Disaster Capitalism find ultimate incarnation through the massive privatization of the US government & unbashed profiteering courtesy of the Iraq War & American taxpayers. An 'empty' government that is run by private corporations & contractors is revealed, as is the exodus of public servants to the private sector & indeed to the very same corporations reaping the benefits of public money (the most profitable industries being oil, construction & security). Fingers are unapologetically pointed & names boldly named.<br /><br />Klein has a wealth of resources, & the information, though dense, is still exceptionally engaging. She paints a most dark picture of the US influence over the World's economy far & wide citing examples in the Caribbean, South Korea, Indonesia, Sri Lanka's post Tsunami coast line & of course Iraq. The fact that this book was written before the current World recession & the collapse of so many industries/institutions, makes it eerily prophetic. Indeed, the current financial climate has made it an even more relevant read & one is left to wonder if the collapse of the world's economy is part of the purposeful execution of the Shock Doctrine.<br /><br />Though it may sound like conspiracy theory, Klein's wealth of information, gravitas & credibility are more than convincing. Whether or not you find her arguments cogent, Klein helps you to understand how global ecomonies interact & makes you a more informed citizen. She builds a solid case & effectively puts the World's superpowers on trial. You have to judge for yourself - but it is unquestionably worth hearing this evidence.Klein helps you to understand how global ecomonies interact & makes you a more informed citizen.

B000002KDO|5.0|Being a Sabbath lover, I just recently grabbed Master Of Reality from my collection to play in the car on a short road trip, that was over a week ago, and I can't take it out of the CD  player, it's like I've rediscovered it. This has to be the absolute heaviest album of all time. I recently lent it to a young (21) co-worker of mine who enjoys all types of music, mostly country, but also Ac/Dc, Metallica, Audioslave, etc. I told him I thought this was the heaviest record I've ever enjoyed, and that when he played it for the first time, to keep in mind it was released in 1971. Well, he came back the next day with a sheepish grin on his face and was like \\"O.K., that was really, really good.\\" It felt good being right of course, but it felt better to turn on someone young to a band I've loved since I was about 13 (I'm 42 now). This recording is dark, dirty, HEAVY, slow, almost like a plodding monster rising up from the dirt, complete with moaning and just awesome growls and squeaks from the guitar that have to be heard to be believed. It's difficult to put into words, but it is simply incredible. Although \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\" is probably my favorite recording, this is an album that can stand on its own (indeed, none of their other albums sound like it) and if it doesn't give you a chill down your spine the first time you play it, you will never really get it.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I love this movie, and it helps that my wife also loves it. Robert Downey Jr. was always a favorite of mine, and i was so happy to hear that he was clean and doing movies again! Most people said he couldn't do it, but for those of us who remember who this man is, knew he would do great, because he can't do any thing less than perfection. This movie might be the best looking blu-ray I own, or atleast in the top five. Def. worth watching over and over again.
B000002LIW|5.0|Clearly a masterpiece and a must-have on vinyl format!  This one is worth every cent!  I'm very satisfied with my purchase of the Jane's Addiction \\"Ritual De Lo Habitual\\".    Thanks,    D
B001LPWGE6|5.0|I loved all three of these movies from the first time i saw them. I thought they looked great, sounded great, and above all had great plots. But if you havent seen and heard these movies in Blu then you haven't seen these movies the way they were meant to be seen. All of them, from identity to ultimatum are breathtaking to behold in blu. I heard from some that identity does not look as good as the other two but i have a top of the line samsung and identity looks amazing! Definitely worth every penny!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I origionaly bought this CD for my sister, but I have borrowed it a few times now and I LOVE it.    It has an amazing mix of different types of songs (rock, classical and even a country-type music song)    Suggestion: Great for having it on in the car :)
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|I was a little disappointed.  I loved the Broadway Show, but the movie was hard to watch.  It got very dark in some scenes and you could hardly see what was happening.  Plus the story line just didn't hold my interest. The music though was enjoyable.
B001I82RVS|4.0|Tokyo Gore Police, starring one of my favorite Japanese bad girl starlets. (The other being Chiyaki Kuriyama)  Tokyo Gore Police left me nearly astounded.  I had first wanted to watch it only because Eihi Shiina was in it. She had done such an amazing job in Audition that I had to pick up something else with her in it.    I didn't look into the movie much after finding it out. Which comes to basically not looking up any trailers or reviews. I wanted to go in completely mystified in what I was getting myself into.    When I found it in the store for purchase (Hastings) I snatched it up since it was the only copy on the shelf.  It took me a while to finally pop it in and watch it. First taking part in the trailer, to get me in the mood. The trailer was incredibly long, and drawn out. Like an infomercial that never seems to end. However I got a taste of what was to come. And it was a small taste at that.     Before watching it I had claimed to a friend it wasn't much on the \\"Pinku\\" side, because of what I had read left a LOT out. Thus as I was watching the preview itself, I realized how wrong I was.     The movie starts out happily enough, then is cut short when the first actual death is shown. And it occurs to me that the effects are probably going to be shady. A lot of the scenes in the movie, anywhere from the arterial spray that can produce enough thrust to jet pack a man through the air.... to wrist cutting that looks similar to the scene in \\"Suicide Club\\" when the lady is chopping off her fingers.     The movie has a lot to offer, its entertaining, gruesome, and has its moments where you wonder what the actors though of Yoshihiro Nishimura when he told them to do the scene. Including the commercials for the Wii Game that is real time of killing of murderers, or the cutesy wrist slicing device that is being sold in multitude of colors, gearing towards young teen girls.    It proves a purpose though, showing how the lifestyle and mental crisis of humanity can eventually take a toll.     And that dear readers is just a dip into the ocean of \\"Tokyo Gore Police\\" I wouldn't recommend it for younger audiences, due to the sexual nature of the film. If the blood and guts doesn't throw them off first.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great game for ages 10 on up. Easy to learn, easy to play and the board changes every game. It also doesn't take a whole evening to play. One to two hours at most. Our total time went down as we became more familiar with the rules.    I was surprised that teenagers raised on video games would enjoy this title when they usually show nothing but disdain for boardgames.    I wish the original game came ready to use with six players instead of just four which would alleviate the need to purchase an expansion pack. When we had 8 people that wanted to play we just teamed up in groups of two.    Check wikipedia for excellent commentary and you'll see why this game won \\"Game of the Year\\" on three continents!
1594201927|4.0|I can see why some people complain about some unexplained terms/concepts found in this book and I can also see any experts in the field will find some (or a large) part of the book is not to their satisfactoin.    But, this book is aimed at general reading public and to me who has general interests in history *and* finance, this has been a fascinating read. The author is very good at story telling. This book gave me enough motivation and pointers for further inquiry on my own.    Well timing of the publication is unfortunate. A lot of important history is happening right now which is by definition missing from the book.    Overall, good enough for 4 stars.
1573223026|4.0|This seemingly is a dark topic, suicide. I expected a somber read, but found myself laughing out loud several times.<br /><br />Hornby constantly undermines the seriousness of his subject matter in order to make it bearable<br /><br />This is a funny book about four people who try to commit suicide. I had never read a book by Nick Hornby, but couldn't imagine how such a serious subject could be treated lightly and still be in good taste. But the author constantly undermines the seriousness of his subject matter in order to make it bearable.<br /><br />On New Year's Eve in North London, four lost souls go to a roof of a particularly famous suicide point called \\"Topper's House\\" to leap. Only to discover a few people already wanting to jump and instead of jumping, end up striking up an uneasy friendship. (Even though they had nothing in common beyond that one thing WANTING TO JUMP.)<br /><br />I would have given this a 5 star except for the huge amount of profanity in the first 1/3 of the book.  The ending well I thought could have been different.  But overall an exceptional listen.  The lady who listened to this with me is a very religious christian in her late 50's  and she really enjoyed it profanity, suicide and all. She agreed the ending could have been a little different it felt like it was a little rushed.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|I heard the title track courtesy of my brother and took a chance on the album. I was attracted to her voice and her lyrics, both of which call to mind Erin McKeown's CD, Grand, and that's a good thing. The album's a bit more laid back, Melody's more of a trad jazz inflected performer/writer, but she's  someone you'll be glad to spend time with.
0060751967|5.0|This book was simply wonderful! This book is absoluetly amazing it has just the right touch of humor and a great plot. All I can say is that I can't wait to buy the next book in the series! This book is simply one of a kinf in the supernatural world!
B001JV5B12|1.0|I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN MY PURCHASE. UNDERWORLD HAD A VERY LOUD CRACKLING NOISE THROUGHOUT THE LAST HALF OF THE MOVIE. UNDERWORLD EVOLUTION HAD IT THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE. IT WAS HORRIBLY DISTRACTING AND RUINED OUR MOVIE WATCHING.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Great shows don't come around too often, but 'Breaking Bad' is one that belongs at the top the list! Great drama, action, comedy, acting and story telling make this show a must see! While this season only had 7 episodes, it packed more entertainment than 90% of the theatrical films released in the same year.<br /><br />The story of a high school chemistry teacher who finds out he has lung cancer is both heartbreaking and shocking. The casting is perfect, the story is gripping and it's the kind of show that will have you saying OMG more than once an episode. The series is filmed in widescreen to give it that movie look and there is plenty of adult action to keep the most jaded viewer interested from start to finish. If you like TV shows like 'Rescue Me' or films like 'Pulp Fiction' you will love the show! Don't pass this one up folks!...it's a knock out!<br /><br />If I have one gripe it's that I think the price is a bit steep for such a short season, but considering the episodes are 46 minutes long. you can count them as 14 episodes of a standard 22 minute sitcom. Regardless of the  short season, the release is full of interesting extra material and looks wonderful on Blu Ray.
0307346617|4.0|World War Z is unlike most books I have read, due to the oral history accounting of the events that happen throughout the book. It is like reading several interviews about what happened during the fictitious Zombie War and more importantly, how it effected individual people and communities all over the world. The individual stories that are told have a genuine emotional quality that is all too relevant in these tough global times. Even though it is a collection of individual stories from different points of view, Max Brooks does a wonderful job of tethering these to a broader sense of a main story arc. Once I was finished with the last chapter, I had a clear idea of the big picture. Very rewarding. I immediately passes it along to a friend!
0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer is a charming, beautifully written, work of historical fiction that you will not be able to put down.  The story is told through letters which seems an impossible way to tell a story, but the author is a master of developing characters and plot through this confining medium.  This little talked about piece of history during World War II is a perfect backdrop to an achingly beautiful story that will leave you wanting more time with these characters.  Loved this book!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|I have no musical skills and do not have the trained ear of a musician or a sound technician.  I just listen to music.  Even my untrained ears can hear that there are problems with the audio quality of Death Magnetic.  Lars Ulrich's drums and cymbals sound especially bad - almost like he is playing on a toy drum set or, even worse, like he is the guy beating on plastic buckets at a subway station.  The drums and cymbals do not have the natural resonance and slow fade that they should have.  They sound very flat.  The sound overall is loud and clipped - lacking clarity of high and low tones.      I have listened to Death Magnetic with headphones and in a couple of different stereos and on ipod, and the sound problems are apparent no matter what format or device I listen to the album on.  Probably the best place to hear these songs will be live, in concert if they come to your town.      If it was not for the poor audio quality, this would be one of my favorite Metallica albums.  (My favorite is Master of Puppets.)  Stylistically, the songs on this album seem to draw strong inspiration from all of Metallica's previous albums.  They are perhaps too similar to previous songs, almost lacking originality.  However, at least they are similar to many of Metallica's best songs, making very few tracks on this album tracks you would skip over.  The album overall is heavier than their more recent offerings.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Slumdog millionaire was a wonderful film that not only portrayed Indian life but also was an incredible portrait of love that can last a lifetime.  I knew that this film won the Oscar and many other awards but didn't know much about the plot.  It essentially is the love story of two young people and how their lives separate them and bring them back together.     The way this film is shot is definately unique. The violence and brutality in the movie don't quite seem as realistic as a typical action/drama movie.  I believe this makes it slightly easier to watch for those that have trouble watching those types of films.  Overall this movie was solid.  I am not enamored enough to give it 5 stars but I would recommend it to anybody interested.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|amazing! i am in love with this and i already bought the ticket to go and see the show here in Florida! Thanks!
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I have always liked Bond movies and have felt that they offered more than your typical action film.<br />I look forward to the new gadgets, cars and the Bond girls.  This movie to me seemed to be missing the<br />Bond elements, but was still very enjoyable.  I rated the movie 5 stars because even as an action film the movie was very enjoyable.  Personally I would have enjoyed more gadgets and more of a traditional Bond role.  Daniel Craig is by far the most rough around the edges Bond in the franchise history.<br /><br />It also was a bit of a continuation from Casino Royale.  Seeing Casino Royale is not mandatory but it does make Quantum Solace more enjoyable.  I would recommend for maximum pleasure to watch both back to back.  With that being said the movie is easy to follow, very exciting and most important it is an entertaining movie.  This may not be the best Bond movie but it was one of the best movies of last year.  If you like action films you will not be disappointed, but if you are only watching the movie because it is a Bond movie you may be slightly disappointed.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|plesantly surprised by this album, bought it for one song and ended up likely the entire CD
0385340567|2.0|I've read all the Reacher books and look forward to them. This one is the worse. A silly beginning and now our hero has even become dim-witted. Other than being dominating physically, I have appreciated the way Reacher reasons through problems. I once described him as the basic action hero who also thinks. Here he is just a bozo, even a bully.
B001NFNFIK|3.0|A couple of years ago I heard the French director Bertrand Tavernier was adapting In the Electric Mist with the Confederate Dead, where James Lee Burkes Dave Robicheaux investigates a murder while a film company sets up shop in town and He has drug fueled hallucinations where He is visited by John Bell Hood, a famous Civil War general (and believe no the series is not as awesome as having some alcoholic stumble around talking to ghosts sounds). The cast would be headlined by Tommy Lee Jones including Kelly Macdonald, Peter Sarrsgard and John Goodman and was filmed in the real New Iberia Lousiana. What could go wrong with having a world famous director and a cast like that make a movie? Apparently everything as I never heard of a release date for the movie until it was shat out straight to DVD yesterday. Now I know that pedigree isn't enough to mainline at least a countrywide release but I thought why not an independent release instead. Was the final film that bad that it couldn't have at least a better release. Well to tell the truth its not bad but...  Well for one big problem is the lack of any real suspense in the whole movie thats billed as a thriller. They have twists and turns but there wasn't anything that generated interest. I mean sure they incorporate Katrina into the picture, and the actors are decent at what they do. Theres too many plot points that don't wrap up easy and have a hard time fitting together in the first place. I've heard complaints that the movie seemed tailored to readers of the novel but really when theres nothing there thats a bigger problem. I suppose you could say that the whole thing doesn't even really take time developing the characters in interesting ways as well. The actors do what they can but the only one who seemed interesting at least was Kelly Macdonald who was only in a few scenes and was taken out of the picture incredibly too early in a scene too telegraphed. Tavernier sadly also seems to be a problem. I've only seen oneother film the straight adapation of Jim Thompson's Pop. 1280 (Corp De Touchon) but He seems more lockstep shooting the script and hoping the actors are good enough to make something of it. There the actors and script were good. Here the actors are good but the script isn't and the film falters.   Which is a shame really because the film does occupy its setting like Burkes books do. Theres a lot more local talent on display then actors and the setting of the movie was a beautiful location. Just the movie outside of the scenes where Jones confers with Hood hallucination was what worked. Other than that I found the movie decidedly average. Okay just reading DVDBeaver where apparently there are two cuts of the film, a producers cut which We have here and a better directors cut.   The DVD is a sad affair too. The picture on my set suffered from some pixelation despite having good color and a generally sharp picture though the sound was good. There are no extras on the disc which given the problems of the movie isn't suprising.
