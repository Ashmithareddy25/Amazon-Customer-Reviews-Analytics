B000T45C6E|3.0|It's good.  My wife and I spent two evenings watching it.  Her main complaint was \\"Why don't we get to watch more of the of the good times\\" but she cried three times during the movie.  My only question was \\"How did he keep from smelling bad throughout the film?\\"  I'm in a little bit of a crisis myself, so I kept thinking \\"What will I do if my career fails?\\"  I hope I don't have to sleep in a cave.

B00005JPHT|5.0|To call Michael Moore a divisive figure would be putting it extremely mildly.  Even someone like me, who quite often agrees with many of his points, at times gets tired of the contemptuous way he often presents said points.  At the same time, I find it interesting how people who disagree with him often do exactly what they accuse him of:  ignoring or hiding the facts.  Instead of addressing his points they'll make remarks about his appearance, or talk about his \\"followers\\" or accuse him of being anti-American.  Or my favorite:  they'll accuse him of being hypocritical because he's wealthy (which I find interesting because, as far as I know, he's never said there's anything wrong with being wealthy; he seems to disapprove of ultimate wealth at all costs because that invariably leaves a portion of the population in a perpetual state of poverty (alliteration rules).<br /><br />I think SiCKO is quite possibly Moore's greatest achievement yet.  I've appreciated his self-appointed mission since I first had to study [[ASIN:B00009YXAS Roger & Me]] in college.  And more so than any movie in history, [[ASIN:B00005JNEI Fahrenheit 9/11]] made documentaries popular and relevant to the general population.  But SiCKO is the first time that we get the impression that he actually cares more about the people that he supposedly represents than he does about the cause du jour that he's championing.  He also does an excellent job of putting faces on this particular epidemic.  It is one thing to rationalize private health care when one is just looking at numbers and statistics.  It is something else entirely when you have to enter the lives of the people who have to live with their particular ailment.<br /><br />To be sure, Moore continues to use his most common magic trick of asking you to focus on what is in his right hand while ignoring what's in his left:  he never talks about the taxes paid by people in socialized health care systems; for all we know, the doctor in London that he interviews might be the wealthiest practitioner in all of the United Kingdom; and I don't care how he tries to make it look, I can't imagine that there is a large percentage of people who would rather go to a hospital in Cuba than they would one in the United States.<br /><br />That being said, there are many facts that he presents that cannot be denied, no matter how strong a critic of Moore one is:<br /><br />- in the nations he visits, if you're sick, you WILL have access to a doctor for virtually no out of pocket cost;<br />- child mortality rates in the United States ARE higher than those in Cuba.<br />- the United States government HAS ignored the health conditions that have developed in September 11 volunteer workers.<br /><br />Moore's most significant point in SiCKO is this:  in a land where health care is private, the goal is not to actually help people but to make a profit.  Thus there is significant incentive for insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, lobbyists and Congressmen to turn away those in need (or make it extremely expensive to get help) rather than spend the money to assist them.  While many politicians continue to preach the evil of socialized health care, the fact is that it works in other nations.  And, as he points out, why is this such an issue when these same politicians seem to have absolutely no problem whatsoever with socialized police systems, fire departments, postal services and public education?<br /><br />In the film, one of the Americans living in France echoes a line from [[ASIN:B000FS9FCQ V for Vendetta (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]:  France has the number one health care system in the world (as ranked by the World Health Organization) because there the government is afraid of its people.  The United States is able to get away with being the only industrialized nation in the world without universal health care because here, people are afraid of the government.

6305364648|5.0|James Cameron is one of the greatest filmmakers in the business. He combines great and spectacular action sequences with interesting and often funny characters. And when he pairs up with legendary action-star Arnold Schwarzenegger, the consequences are fantastic! After the stellar \\"Terminator\\" films, they teamed up once again for \\"True Lies,\\" a stellar action film with awesome action sequences and great storytelling! The cast and crew do a fantastic job of bringing Cameron's story of terrorists and spies to the screen!

B000NVIXFK|3.0|I'm going to give an abbreviated review of this album, not make a lengthy account of it track-by-track.  \\"Snakes & Arrows\\" is a solid piece of work, no doubt.  However, in many cases (at least to me) Rush sounds like the best band in the universe, working with material that is merely decent, no better.  And this is coming from someone who has been a huge Rush fan since buying \\"Hold Your Fire\\" when I was 15 years old.  Im not particularly disappointed, but Im not blown away either.
0571202284|5.0|This book was recommended by my son's animation teacher at BU's Center for Digital Imaging Arts.  He's thrilled to have it.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|Wow - 40 years old right? Well, 40 years old and still rocking is an amazing feat no matter how you view the album.  For me, this album has the characteristic early Pumpkins elements we've all come to know and love (and miss):  airtight, harmonic guitar melodies, space-track solos and riffs, full walls of rich, distorted guitars, and rip-your-throat-out drum tracks.      BUT, Zeitgeist's sound is still different than anything before - definitely not cheesy electro-pop like Zwan. Definitely not an album of plain, filler songs like Machina.  Not quiet like Adore.      No, on the contrary, Zeitgeist is an album that, thank god, will for the first time make you think back to Siamese Dream - and then realize this is 2007 - a time of tangible global destabilization.  You won't find a high school anthem song like \\"Today\\" on Zeitgeist.  Happy-go-lucky Pumpkins, this is not.    INSTEAD, we are treated to a sound that is a reflection of our times - a somewhat off but refined sound - solidifying a common awareness of the possibility of a darker future.  Zeitgeist has darker-sounding chromatics, yes, but it is beautifully melodic without 1990's angst or any 2000's pop angry metal like Puddle of Mudd, etc.    Zeitgeist is the sound I've been waiting for without being a Siamese Dream II.  Listen to the whole album, and bask in its with-the-times originality coupled with that nostalgic Pumpkins sound.  In my opinion, Siamese Dream was landmark, and after Mellon Collie and Adore, everything else Corgan/Chamberlin was a turn off (sorry).      Which brings me to now. 2007.  Zeitgeist is the first Corgan / Chamberline effort that is well worth making you (if you're like me) come back to listening to the Pumpkins.  No disrepect to Corgan or anyone, I just like music that rocks.  And among all their album releases, this album has a few tracks that do.

0553804677|4.0|At first I found the pace a little difficult and the story line a little hard to follow.  The first few chapters were difficult for me.  But once I got \\"on the same page\\" (so to speak) with Mr. Lynch I was off and running.<br /><br />This is an amazing new world he constructs for the reader.  The relationships he creates make for a very enjoyable read.  You can't help but fall right in step with the main character criminal Locke and his band of thieves.<br />I look forward to more stories with the Gentlemen Bastards.<br /><br />Would have gotten five stars if not for the difficult first few chapters for me.

So the part seems to contain the whole - and this bears out in body parts and other areas of life. Think of iridology (sp?), etc. Fascinating connections in this book! To take it all a step further, spiritually, perhaps read one of Paul Twitchell's books. He was a genuine adventurer in the limitless planes of the divine. The Flute of God is more than inspiring - for this reader. Onward, T.P.B.

0316067598|5.0|Read the book in one day.  I knew it would be a fine example of  what our men and women in the Armed Forces are facing every day.  It  truly did not disappoint!
0553579908|5.0|First off..this is the second book in the series, so, if you've read the first, you should just buy this one and not bother reading further... If you're new to the series, buy the first book, but the things I mention below will be relavant for the first book as well.    This book is great if you're looking for realistic \\"fantasy\\" (more real-world than fantasy with hardly any magic) and if you want flawed, realistic, and complex characters that are well-rounded and develope as the series progresses.     You may not like this book if you aren't into details and extremely complicated plots (everyone is connected to everything). You might also want to look elsewhere if you only want one plotline going at a time...this book is definately written in \\"soap opera\\" style moving from character to character.     Three final things to consider... First, this book is LONG. No quick read here. But, if like me, you don't want a good book to end, then this book and series is for you. Secondly, if you want to like every character in a book, or know right off who's good and who's bad, this book won't work for you...  Honestly, when reading this book I did sometimes feel that I hated most of the characters for one reason or another.  But, they are like real people, in that you won't like every character you meet and they aren't always predictable.  Lastly, this is a very realistic, middle-ages style work, so you get plenty of gore, violence, death, and other issues of human nature that some readers might object to. But, I must stress, that the book is truely about the story...not the above issues, (the gore, etc.) they are appropriate to the tale and are not added for their own sake.       Great book, great series, give GRRM a try... I did, and now I'm having trouble finding another author and series that is up to his standards (I might be a BIT of a book snob).
B000QEIORG|5.0|I didn't really buy this again for the re-mastering because lets face it, it didn't really need to be re-mastered(you can barely make out the sound difference except for it being a little cleaned up) I bought this again for the six bonus tracks which were all b-sides. I also bought it for the packaging. Foo Fighters are a great band.

If you like Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons or you're just beccoming interested in them, this is a great CD to have.

B00005N5S5|5.0|I love this movie to death.  I first saw it when I was a junior student at Soochow University in Taiwan.  After 22 years, I just would like to keep a copy of this movie, so that I can watch it anytime I want.  Arnold was perfectly cast as a relentless killing machine.  Hamilton and Binhen's story really touches me as well.  The whole story tells us that the only thing that can truely save mankind is not weapon, but love.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Watch this and it will be obvious why Helen Mirren won the Oscar for Best Actress for her remarkable portrayal of the seventy-year-old Elizabeth II, trying to cope with a world she no longer understands -- and doesn't really want to. The story line covers the week following the death in Paris of Princess Diana, which was also the very beginning of Tony Blair's decade as Labor Prime Minister. Many of those surrounding Blair (played very effectively by Michael Sheen) -- including his wife, Cherie -- were not sympathetic to anything about the Royal Family, whom they regarded as outmoded leeches on society. And while we will never know just how authentic Peter Morgan's first-rate script is, the viewer will come away convinced that Prince Philip and the Queen Mother, especially, had and have a 19th-century attitude of entitlement. Prince Charles comes off as a pathetic weakling, too, trying to sidle up to Blair for his own protection. Because of the Queen's insistence on \\"privacy,\\" her complete lack of understanding of the need of the public all around the world to mourn Diana, one quarter of the British people toward the end of that week were becoming convinced the monarchy should be abolished. (And that's my gripe with the real-world Blair, too: He had the chance to kill off the monarchy completely but he didn't take it. Instead, he converted to storybook royalism, a victim of mawkish sentimentality -- just as his wife warned him all prime ministers had done.) As a dramatic film (not a documentary), this effort is very, very good.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|As an fan of Pink Floyd the music was as always awesome and since I have never seen them live, I especially enjoyed David Gilmour's solo pieces. In some parts the guitar could have sounded more clear and louder, but overall awesome.The final icing on the cake was having a spectacular light show wish I could have been there just for that so that together I believe the fans get more than their money's worth. So turn up the volume, clear your eyes and get ready to trance out exquisitely.

B000NVIXFK|2.0|I feel like Judas for writing this. Rush are one of rock's best bands. They could produce a recording of farts and I'd buy it just to support them and say thanks for what they have done. Whilst Snakes & Arrows is technically jaw-dropping it just doesn't have the melodic accessibility of Rush's better works.    Melody has never been Rush's strong suite. This is largely due to the unusual way Rush compose songs; with the onus on the band's bass player/vocalist Geddy Lee to pull a tune out of jam-session tracks made with guitarist Alex Lifeson and somehow find some of drummer/lyricist Neil Peart's words to fit. This formula seems to have failed them for the third studio album in a row.    The songs sound amazing... but they go blam blam blam and not much else. You can hear the music has been layered on a click track, and if you import the songs into sound editing software you can see many of the waveforms are full volume from beginning to end.    Rush albums are always tough going at first. It took me a year to realize \\"Presto\\" was a masterpiece. But no matter what direction the band goes, they can never be described as background music. A Rush album demands concentration. But for me, melody is the in-road... \\"the hook\\"... and this album just doesn't deliver. Even the album's stand-out track \\"Far Cry\\" barely scrapes through, being saved by some harmonious Oooo-ing in the chorus. In fact, for pretty much being the only song with a chorus.    I love the fact that Rush are doing 5.1 mixes of their material, and I go giddy at the thought that they may return to their back-catalogue and re-release 5.1 versions of their existing albums. I'd even venture to listen to Moving Pictures again, which for me has been so over-played, it's sadly gone the way of Led Zeppelin and The Beatles.    The packaging of Snakes & Arrows is phenomenal. The video material is a great, though at times too insightful bonus. (It is fantastic to see an upbeat Neil Peart.) All the software stuff is a lot of fun. But, ultimately it's the music that matters. In that regard, Snakes & Arrows can be put next to \\"Test For Echo\\" and \\"Vapor Trails\\". For some that might be good. For me, sadly, it's not.

B000OQF6N6|1.0|I've been thrilled about an SP reunion since Billy announced it.  They're one of my all-time favorite bands, and created many songs that have impacted my life in one way or another.  Even without the return of James Iha, I still had faith in Billy Corgan.  I've known that the majority of their previous music was all written by--and in some cases--performed by him (like most of \\"Siamese Dream\\").    That being said, \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a bland and tired effort.  It is easily the worst CD with the SP name on it.  Aside from the fact that the music is boring and uneventful, the liner notes for the CD are ludicrous.  Imagine my surprise when I opened up the booklet and the first thing I saw was a picture of Paris Hilton.  The remaining pages are filled with all manner of political statements, most of which are laughably stupid.    I am tempted to do a song for song review, but I don't feel like putting for the effort.  The only songs that are even worth listening to are \\"That's The Way (My Love Is),\\" \\"(Come On) Let's Go,\\" and \\"Bleeding The Orchid.\\"  I got the impression that \\"United States\\" is supposed to be some sort of centerpiece that features their new direction, but it's lyrically childish and musically underwhelming.  The creativity in writing is there, but it feels unfocused.  I also despise the sound of the guitars on this CD--they're too fuzzy for their own good.  He also uses some god-awful vocal effects that take away from his voice.    It's too bad.  I know every band will release a CD that isn't as good as the others, so I'm hoping this is SP's.

630215829X|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing FANTASIA on the big screen, when I was a little girl.  I was enchanted by the imagery and the beautiful classical music soundtrack, from the opening credits, all the way to the last sequence.  This was Walt Disney's way of bringing classical music to the younger generations, the children who went to the movie theaters to see his cartoons.  This presentation of cartoons with classical repertoire succeeds brilliantly on many levels.  For starters, the imagery compliments the mood of the musical pieces.<br /><br />Some of my favorite sequences include:  Nutcracker Suite by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky with a look at the changing seasons, featuring animated fairies, fish, flowers, mushrooms, and leaves, Symphony No. 6 by Ludwig van Beethoven with a mythical ancient Grecian world of centaurs, centaurettes (a Disney studio creation), a pegasus and his family, the gods of Mount Olympus, fauns, cherubs and other creatures and characters of classical mythology, and the Ave Maria by Franz Schubert, with subtle sunlight and naturalistic color.  I should mention that the sequence with Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky is a vision of hell.  It features a wicked demon, whose likeness was based on the features of Bela Lugosi (yes, the original Dracula in the 1930s films).  I was pretty scared, as an eight year old, when watching it.  Keep that in mind when watching it with really small children.<br /><br />My verdict?  This film is a beautiful introduction to classical music, for young viewers, and compelling enough for more mature ones.  This is a throwback to another time, before the age of computer-generated graphics, and you will appreciate the great lengths the animators took to hand-draw every cell in this beautiful film.

0385334206|1.0|I disliked the book mostly on the way it was written.  It was suppose to be funny or something, but I didn't find anything that funny.  The part that turned me off was the writing style.  Donnie did this Donnie did that, it was cute for a little bit, but I got very tired of it.  I am unsure of what Kurt Vonnegut's style usually is, but if it is anything like this, I don't believe I will read another one of his books.  I am a fan of ranting, and get to listen to a lot of good ones, but the style got in the way of all the fun.  Yeah and it only took like 2 hours to read the entire thing.  I normally don't review, but this one bothered me enough to.    If you do read books only for the preface, this is your book.  I thought the preface was quite entertaining...too bad it wasn't longer and the entire plot of the book.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|My family and I watched Stranger than Fiction on Pay-per-view and were pleased with the movie.  The previews I had seen earlier left me wondering if it was going to be a comedy or a dramma (or something else entirely?).  But, after watching the film, I really appreciated how they eased the audience into this odd & quirky mixture of both comedy and tragedy (thus avoiding a bit of shock to die-hard Will Ferrell fans who might have been expecting something like \\"Ricky-Bobby\\" praying to Baby-Jesus).    Anyway, we thought that the film was clever and enjoyed watching Will Ferrell's turning-Point as he took on a more serious, and certainly more endearing, character role.  I remember back when Jim Carrey took on more serious roles while his \\"pure-comedy\\" fans angrily objected (but only for a while, as Jim did eventually prove that he had much more depth than Ace Ventura-type characters).  This role seems to be a similar fork-in-the-road for Will Ferrell and we thought he did a very good job.    If, some years down the road, Will Ferrell is commonly viewed as a seasoned actor with significant depth and range, then you'll be able to look back at \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" and recognize that this was indeed his turning point role.

I thought that the sound was excellent and wondered why so many DOORS fans were not happy with it. I know all the arguments of horns etc... Please take this review of Morrison Hotel from this perspective. As far as sound quality, I immediately compared it too the DOORS first album done in HDCD. There was not much of a loudness issue between formats but there was a sonic and clarity issue. Everything on Morrison Hotel was very clear. The crashing on the symbols, the keyboards, bass lines and guitar sounds were searing. The DOORS HDCD wasn't bad but not comparable in my opinion to this new technology. Also, since I have literally no DOORS on album or earlier CD, the changes in the music themselves doesn't bother me at all. Now when Roadhouse Blues started, you could certainly hear a couple of things that have not been on a standard greatest hits. It didn't bother me one bit. I very much enjoyed Morrison Hotel. I especially like Peace Frog. What a great tune. I also liked the Soft Parade and now am purchasing all these new DOORS CD's in their new technology. I guess for those who have been devout followers all these years that the new sound or masters are a problem. Not to me. Now, if it was another catalog of one of my personal favorites that I know every note sound for sound. Maybe I would have the same problem. In the end, I will purchase the others. The sound is as good as anything I have heard in any technology out now. That includes SACD and DVD-Audio.  By the way, I am not part of the young crowd. I am 47.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|...when Hollywood used rich color and made movies that made you happy with big big stars. But, you know, even in those days, MEET ME IN ST LOUIS was special.<br /><br />Did you know it was based on a some stories by a woman named Sally Benson who was called \\"Tootie\\" when she was growing up? She based her stories on her own life living in St. Louis almost a hundred years ago. That's right. That's even before I was born.<br /><br />This is a very gentle story of family life. I'm glad they didn't try to add more oomph to the story. But they did add songs - and - ooomph - what songs! They even brought back the old old \\"Skip to My Lou\\". You know. Skiiip - skiiip -- skip to m'lou.<br /><br />Now, I know you know Judy Garland from the WIZARD OF OZ. But, try to notice the other actors because they were some of the best of the time. Have I ever told you that 7-year-old Margaret O'Brien, who plays Tootie, is on my personal list of favorite actresses of all time? All time! That's right. I have that book on her films ([[ASIN:0786408855 Margaret O'Brien: A Career Chronicle and Biography]]). Mary Astor who plays the mother was a leading actress for years. Leon Ames was a father-type for years. And Harry Davenport, he was the grandfather I wished I had. And Marjorie Main... well...!<br /><br />So, what do you think? A story of a family living almost a hundred years ago - lotsa songs - a terrific cast - beautiful to look at thanks to director Vincente Minelli and his team.<br /><br />Oh, and it says here there's a \\"making of\\" featurette -- those are usually fun, aren't they -- and a soundie -- that's an old music video -- of the movie's songwriters performing \\"Skip to My Lou\\" in the same style that would be used in the movie.<br /><br />What's that? Alright, Virginia. From now on, I'll call you \\"Tootie\\".
B000JLTRIG|5.0|i like the plots plenty of action with magic and demons and sorry there is only one season left
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This is a great CD.  They blend so well together and everything about it is so beautiful.  You can understand every lyric and it's a CD on which every song you like.  Hope they make more music together.
B0000E1ALR|2.0|It has several B-side tracks yet no 'I'm on fire' or 'my hometown'     ridiculus.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This season was simply awesome!  Everything, including the first 6 episodes were great.  People complained cause they focused to much on Jack, Kate and Sawyer and not enough on the rest of the castaways but when you watch the whole season those episodes were extremely important.  They set everything up so then the series can really end with bang.  This season saw the castaways finally out of the hatch and exploring more of the island like in season 1.  The tone of the show lighten up a bit, i think there was a bit more humor in this season that the last one.  Answers that the fans wanted started finally coming, like the secret of Jack's tatoo, how Locke ended up in a wheelchair, who would Kate choose.  New questions were also brought up as we move into the final half of Lost.  The best thing about this season?  The finale.  It is truly as the producers said, \\"a game changer\\".  Can't wait for Season 4!

068483605X|5.0|WD is a well-written book, with characters of depth, gorgeous descriptions, and an intriguing and exciting plot.     Reasons people dislike the book:  1) \\"It's boring\\" -- if you think The DaVinci Code, The Notebook, The Harry Potter Series, and Stephen King or John Grisham books etc. are well-written, think again. They may be gripping or fun, but that does not make them good literature. Too often, the characters lack depth, based around stock stereotypes, like cut-paper dolls, like summer blockbusters.    2) \\"It has talking bunnies.\\" -- Firstly, this is no Disney tale, like Bambi, or as the National Review may think, Dumbo. Secondly, as to whether talking animals somehow discredits a book from being good, I cite Animal Farm.    3) \\"Too much description\\" -- Some authors, like Robert Jordan, write books with description that serves no purpose to the overall plot and atmosphere. This book is not one of those books. The artfully crafted description creates vivid scenery important to the plot and to the imagination.    4) \\"Made up words\\" -- If you think making up words is a crime in literature, you've just ousted A Clockwork Orange, as well as Lord of the Rings. I did not find the usage of fake words uncomfortable.    But then again, I love classics (Camus, Dostoevsky, Bronte, Nietzsche) and modern fiction (Card, Murakami, LeGuin, Calvino). I'm in my early twenties, and an Ivy League student. I first read the book around 5th grade, loved it, and have reread it many times.
B0007LXPBI|2.0|I probably am not the best person to review this product as I love the older version with Hayley Mills.  However, I like to consider myself unbiased and open to new versions of the same films.<br /><br />Plot:<br />If you've seen the old version of this, you already know this part.  Two girls meet at camp and realize that they are in fact twin sisters.  They switch places to meet their other parents and to attempt to bring their parents back together.  But the father's marriage to a much younger woman may thwart family bliss!<br /><br />Good:<br />The actress who played Meredith is absolutely wonderful!  I was never convinced Vicki in the old film was actually young; this \\"Vicki\\" is most definitely young enough to be Dad's daughter.  Also, Lindsay Lohan makes a cute set of twins.  She does a good job acting like two different people at such a young age.  Dennis Quaid makes a good loving, dorky father while Natasha Richardson shines as the mother.  Lastly, I adored Chessy, the quirky maid.  Seeing the original \\"Vicki\\" from the old \\"Parent Trap\\" with the same name (which makes one wonder: where are Susan and Sharon?) was absolute fun!<br /><br />Bad:<br />Oh, boy.  Here we go.<br />1.  How many situations do we have to see that make Annie and Hallie twins?  I can understand the strawberry allergy, but the Oreo/peanut butter thing, fencing, and poker??  How can two girls raised in two different continents with two completely different parents have so much in common?<br />2.  I think having the mother show up drunk at the hotel was completely unnecessary.  It is funny for laughs, but not appropriate for the target audience (plus, would a formal British woman like Elizabeth really get drunk?).<br />3.  Chessy and Martin's romance, while cute, was a little over the top.<br />4.  Elizabeth and Nick's romance was whirlwind (no wonder they divorced so soon after!).  Their breakup was silly (at least the way that they explained it in the movie: that Elizabeth expected Nick to chase her down.  Puhlease!  Grow up!).  Their chemistry was great, but I just couldn't believe their history.<br />5.  Grandfather was not an integral part of the show.  He became eclipsed by Martin.  This wouldn't have been so bad if he hadn't been the one to get the truth from Hallie at the phone booth.<br />6.  The stunts the girls performed to antagonize each other were not feasible.  I don't know many girls that can disassemble beds, haul them to the roof, and reassemble them in the time it takes for three girls to go on a hike.<br />7.  Last major beef: so many of the lines are cut and paste from the old version, but not delivered with the same energy or don't make sense in the new context.  Or situations (such as the sticks and the mountain lions) are presented without the necessary explanations.<br /><br />Dialoge/Sexual Situations/Violence<br />Dialogue is mainly restricted to \\"Oh my God\\" and other exclamations.  Sexual situations will be too much for the younger set (Meredith and Dad discuss hotel rooms, sex is brought up between Hallie and Meredith, a girl jumps in the lake naked, etc.).  Violence is restrained to falling down or smacks across the face.<br /><br />Overall:<br />If I could have given 1.5 stars, I would.  The actors are excellent.  However, the main flaws in this film are its riding off the old film and uninventiveness.  Further, this is much more risque than its older counterpart.  Good for the younger (but not too young) set, but adults will see the flaws and not be able to enjoy.stry was great, but I just couldn't believe their history.  5.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Quite easily the least formulaic, most believable and possibly most exciting, Bond film ever.<br /><br />It's the type of movie, however, that may turn off those with imagination dysfunctions.<br /><br />Here is how Bond got his first Aston Martin, his first Tuxedo, his first kill etc... and all made in an enjoyable film with little foreshadowing. We also learn how Bond became a cold blooded, heartless b@$t@rd and the fact that MI6 wants him that way.<br /><br />Nicely done.
B000PC6Z48|5.0|Sergio Corbucci's Django is a definite example of a spaghetti western classic. Our mysterious protagonist Django(Franco Nero) arrives to this lonely town. He drags a coffin behind him. We still don't know what's in the coffin. That's one of the mysteries of the character. We still don't know what are his motives. You just constantly ask, who is that guy ?  There are some great performances , great action ,and some pretty cool surprises in this picture. It's shot pretty well . There's alot of hand held camera used during the action sequences. You feel like your there almost , like you fall with the characters. I love that . I also recommend The HellBenders, Companeros, The Great Silence , and anything else   Corbucci you can find.   9/10      [...].
B0000DZ3IG|2.0|This review is for the American CD.   I loved the movie and after viewing it for the first time immediately watched it again.  I read on this site that some listeners were disappointed with the soundtrack, but I couldn't resist purchasing it anyway because I couldn't live without the Billy Mack song.  Given the subject of the movie, I will call the CD a \\"heartbreaking\\" disappointment.  The three Christmas songs are included here, but are listed as \\"bonus tracks,\\" which indicates that the director of the movie didn't understand what the audience wanted from the soundtrack.  \\"All I want for Christmas is You\\" and most especially Billy Mack's song \\"Christmas is all around us\\" are not just seasonal holiday songs within the context of this movie--they are the ultimate love songs. Everyone in the movie was great, but can there be many viewers who didn't feel Billy Mack was the center of the story?  Yes, little kids with crushes, a widowed man who apparently finds another love quite quickly (Claudia Schiffer to boot), and young couples getting together are all very sweet.  But the heartbreak of unrequited love, a married woman who realizes her husband is thinking about another woman and Billy Mack save the movie from being just too cute.   Billy Mack was a mid-fifties, superficial,  \\"ex heroin addict struggling for a comeback at any price\\" who figures out what love is and shares it with another human being, albeit not in a romantic relationship. Billy Mack (along with the unreturned love story line and the Emma Thompson story) lifted the movie out of the realm of cliches.  The movie starts with Billy Mack and his song, which underscores the struggle for love that everyone in the movie is going through. But the song was gutted of its joy in the soundtrack version--very little use of the backup singers.  Instead of including tracks that I don't think were even in the movie, this song should have been played at length, perhaps in two versions.  The beginning of the movie withthe song and the conversational interjections would have been a creative addition to the soundtrack.  Another song gutted of its joy is \\"All you need is love\\"--the surprising and lovely orchestration in the movie was replaced with trite clapping on the soundtrack.  At least the director couldn't mess with the Beach Boys and Joni, whose song underscored the tale of marital infidelity.  But if you want to experience the joy of human beings taking the risk of \\"getting the s*** kicked out of us by love,\\" watch the movie again.  Don't waste your money on the soundtrack. When will directors figure out that audiences want the sound tracks just as they were in the movie?
0743298020|5.0|The 13th Tale is a story about storytelling and if you have an imagination stocked with classic English literature, you'll sink down into it with pleasure.    This is one of those books you buy several copies of just to give out as gifts to reader-friends.  I read it in the midst of a hot Australian summer, but it's the sort of book you should save for winter, a chair by the fire, a mohair rug on your knee, a cup of tea and the whole day ahead of you just to read - no interruptions.  You won't put it down.

0679746048|2.0|This is the rare case when the movie is far superior to the book. The book is very introspective and mostly medical, as the author examines her diagnosis and reflects on it. The characters she meets in the mental institution are touched on briefly. I applaud the screenwriters for taking those few mentions and expanding them and really making an interesting story out of it...which is the movie. Their different spin on Lisa, Daisy, the tunnels, the suicide, the psychology behind Daisy, were all very imaginative. On the other hand, the book does a better job of explaining the title and tying it into the Vermeer painting, which isn't even mentioned in the movie.
B00005N6KG|4.0|This is my 4th pair of earphones that I've purchased for my ZenV. all the others, especially the ones that just 'plug' into your ear were very uncomfortable, most didn't even fit in my abnormally small ears. so if you have small ears and are looking for something inexpensive (these headphones don't have the best sound, but are decent) these will do the job. Great for working out, they won't fall out!
B000G73U5Y|5.0|I wouldn't call myself a big Steely Dan fan.  I did however grow up in a household where my dad had Aja and I remember listening to a few of their songs on the radio.  This collection succeeds because it has all the best songs that the casual fan would know and introduces people like me to what Steely Dan has been up to lately with the two new tracks.  Typically I am not a huge fan of collections that max out the CD because usually with some artists by the time I get to about 45 minutes I have had enough.  With Steely Dan, since this is all top notch music, the 80 minutes seem to fly by... even the new tracks sound very good up against the old standards.  I keep this in my regular rotation and may someday, since I love this collection so much, may check out some of their albums.<br /><br />If you are a casual fan like myself and want a nice remastered hits collection this is where you can start.  For the more hardcore fan this of course is not for you but it is a great way to lure in new fans to the fold as it did me.
B000Q67DEO|5.0|\\"Eat to The Beat\\" was the FIRST full album video release, with a music video for every track. It is a pity that it took 28 years to make it from VHS to DVD. \\"Eat To The Beat\\" is second only to \\"Parallel Lines\\" in the Blondie catalog. Both the CD and videos are well worth revisiting as rock classics.
B000PTYP5C|2.0|I've tried so many times to get into this band only to be let down.  It started when my roommate in college incouraged  me to borrow \\"awake\\" it was a decent sound with lots  of energy.  This band is not even to close to Rush in terms of a signature sound.  They do way too much overdub--they sound digitized and homogenized.  James LaBrie's voice is too high and lacks big time; i don't know why they must insist on putting these cheesy 'power ballads' in their albums.  This album was supposed to sound gritty and metal but sounds simliar to others they've put out.  It takes more than fancy Time Signatures to be truly progressive metal.      I also recently saw Petrucci on Tour here at the Ryman in Nashville, TN as part of the G3 concert- he certainly displayed some awesome wizardry  but stood in the same spot the whole time with his head down and didn't connect with the crowd.  Portnoy helped by doing some nice tricks with the drumsticks and spitting all over the floor; kinda j. belushi type schtick.
B00005JLCI|5.0|After many years of film adaptations that edited Hamlet down to the bare essentials, Kenneth Branagh had the courage to bring us the complete Hamlet in 1996. The all star cast gives brilliant performances. As with Kenneth Branagh's other films, the costuming and sets are eclectic and anachronistic. But, it works. Why is has taken over 11 years to bring this masterpiece of film to DVD is a puzzle (its release date to DVD has been changed before and may yet change again). But when the DVD is finally released, all serious lovers of theatre, whether it be of Shakespeare or of Hamlet in particular should buy this.
1400079276|4.0|It has been quite a long time that I have been interested in reading a Murakami novel, just never got around to it until now.  Wow, I just finished \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" and immediately began reading \\"After the Quake\\".  This book left me mesmerized, lying awake at night thinking about the real and surreal events that I just read.<br /><br />I've read most of the reviews about \\"Kafka\\" and many of them compare it less favorably to other Murakami novels.  Fortunately, I cannot bring that comparison to my view of the book.  As I move to other Murakami novels, I'll be better able to assess how \\"Kafka on the Shore\\" compares to his other novels.<br /><br />The story focuses on two primary characters. Kafka, a 15 year old boy from Tokyoruns away from home (and his father) and winds up in Takamatsu, \\"educating\\" himself by reading books on a variety of subjects.  Ultimately, he befriends the library clerk and learns of the head librarian, Miss Saeki and her tragic past.<br /><br />Nakata is an elderly Tokyo resident who was permanently \\"disabled\\" by a bizarre WWII incident.  While he doesn't function well socially, Nakata's unique ability is to talk with cats and cause fish to rain from the sky.<br /><br />\\"Kafka on the Shore\\" has some of the most hilarious and inventive scenes in modern literature.  Hoshio, Nakata's traveling companion, encounter with Colonel Sanders continues to keep me smiling.<br /><br />The only thing preventing me from giving the book 5 stars is the final 50 pages.  I felt Murakami veered a little too far into the metaphysical over the last 50 pages and could have more tightly wrapped up the ending than he did.<br /><br />All in all, this is one of the more satisfying books that I have read recently and I look forward to enjoying Murakami's other novels.
B00005JPAO|5.0|\\"The Queen\\" is a brilliant look at the private lives of the Windsors at the time of Diana, Princess of Wale's death. Helen Mirren truly deserved the Academy Award for Best Actress in her portrayal of HRM Queen Elizabeth. Carefully researched and documented, it gives us a behind the scenes look at what happened following the death of Diana and the Queen's response that was not known to the general public at the time. The film is full of subtle nuances and metaphors that only repeated viewing will allow you to fully grasp. You can not take in all of the subtlties of the film in a single viewing. Whether you are a devoted follower of the life and death of Diana or of the life of the Queen, this is a must have for your DVD collection.
B000000OA6|5.0|Another awesome album by Queen.  Powerful, emotional, and yet very typical of Queen.    \\"The Show Must Go On\\" says it all.  This was the best way Freddie could have ended his last album.
B000OCXFCO|3.0|though I cannot give it five or even four stars.  More like 3.5 for good effort.  I have followed Megadeth since 92' when I bought Countdown on tape and have purchased most of their albums, except for Risk and the World Needs a Hero.  I will say that the first five tracks are awesome, there are blazing riffs on and interesting lyrics on each one, and they don't sound all alike.  I did not like the entire album because the middle falls on its face, it becomes repetitive and things start to sound alike.  I really wish that Dave M and Dave E would settle their differences along with M. Friedman and N. Menza and get together to put out some truly great stuff.  Unlike some reviewing here I think Mustaine still has plenty of ideas and passion for his music, I think the problem here is the other musicians; there was a better lineup on the System Has Failed, IMO.  My favorites include Sleepwalker, with its neat opening and killer riffs, Gears of War and the title track rock, along with Burnt Ice.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Like the rest of the people here, I wasn't sure what to make of this CD the first time I heard it...but after listening to it a few times, it hasn't left my CD changer yet.    \\"Bleed it out\\", \\"No More Sorrow\\", and \\"What I've Done\\" are my favorites.  \\"No More Sorrow\\" is even a little reminiscent of Metallica.  Overall great CD!
0385340559|5.0|I read all the books by Lee Child and there all great books to read if one likes action type books.  And I do.  Up there with W.E.B. Griffith and James Patterson.  Hard to put book down when starting reading.  I read by authors and when Lee Child writes another book, I will have to have it.  Very good book.
1400097029|5.0|From the opening sentence to the closing paragraph, Banville produces a masterful literary conundrum. The Sea is a brief and disarmingly subtle story, peopled with timeless and ethereal characters, delivered in shockingly beautiful prose. This story shares, in its own realm, the naively sinister awakenings of the young in The Ripening Seed (Le Blé en Herbe), one of Colette's later novellas, albeit a far more primitively written and translated work than The Sea. Banville takes unprecedented but thoroughly justified liberties with the English language, turning it inside out and leaving it - and the reader - gasping for breath. Banville is the real thing, a poet of the calibre of his fellow countryman, Seamus Heaney. I have read this novella three times, given it away three times, and will doubtless continue to do the same. Some works are meant to wake us up from our aesthetic slumber. This is one of them.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|\\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" is the conclusion of the science fiction trilogy that began with \\"The Matrix\\" and continued with \\"The Matrix: Reloaded.\\"  \\"Revolutions\\" doesn't really add a lot to the story despite its length and showy special effects; it does put a reasonably satisfying conclusion on the whole epic, which featured some cutting edge special effects for its time.<br /><br />\\"Revolutions\\" begins where \\"Reloaded\\" left off, with the last human city of Zion under siege by malevolent machines.  Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus rallies the survivors to buy time for a miracle.  Meanwhile, Neo (Keanu Reeves) works his way through a world equal parts computer language and vaguely Christian symbolism toward a final confrontation with the renegade program Agent Smith.  Neo will be accompanied by Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss) to the location of that final showdown in Machine City.<br /><br />The movie features lots of long, computer-generated action sequences that will appeal to hardcore fans of the series.  A decisive explanation of the movie and the series may not be apparent from a single viewing of \\"Revolutions\\", but maybe that is part of the mystery.  Fans who haven't watched the earlier movies may be confused by the plot, and should probably watch the movies in order.  Recommended to fans of the franchise.
B000MGUZM0|2.0|To put this review in perspective: I bought the Arcade Fire's debut album after hearing heaps of praises from David Bowie and many other famous musicians, but was underwhelmed by all but the opening track. This new album hasn't really done anything to change my opinion that they're no more than a \\"Bright Eyes-lite,\\" even after half a dozen listens.    As even some of the positive reviews of this album have noted, the production is both bombastic and low-fi, and not in a good way. It has a loud, flat sound that gets repetitive and tiring to listen to after awhile. The extra instruments that the band plays on this album sound very clunky and overbearing, particularly the organ that makes a sudden appearance on \\"Intervention.\\"    Some albums with bad productions are more than redeemed by the actual songs, but the vocals and lyrics here are equally clumsy and repetitive. Win Butler still sings like a limper version of Conor Oberst from Bright Eyes, but this time he's also attempting a Springsteen impersonation on several tracks. While it isn't quite as grating as the Killers' attempt to sound like Springsteen, it still comes across as  incredibly affected. The lyrics look like an attempt to make a grand statement about religion, war, and modern life in general, but they read like teenage angst poetry.     The closing track, \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" is the only one that really stands out of the din after several listens. It has a grand, epic, proggy sound and almost lives up to the hype that this band gets, but if you hear it and like it I'd recommend passing on this album and getting something A Tab in the Ocean by Nektar, whom the Arcade Fire bear a strong resemblance to here.
1594200823|5.0|I read about this book on a foodie website and then bought it, not expecting much.  When I started reading it, I could barely put it down.  It is truly interesting and well-researched.  The writing is a bit poor in places, but the content is solid.  A really important book influences behavior, and this one certainly affected the way I live and think.  I cannot eat store-bought chicken anymore.  The book prompted me to try raising my own.  (I read the section on slaughtering chickens over and over.  I wish the description in had been even more detailed, as I am not sure I did it right.)  And, now I read everything on content labels of food to look for corn products.  I try to steer clear of them.  One might say I was primed for changing the way I eat, but this book certainly tipped me over the line.  I am glad I read it.
1594489505|5.0|I enjoyed The Kite  Runner very much. And I was looking forward to this one,   and it  is amazing..  Makes you appreciate what you've got, especially if you are a woman.  The ending blew me away.  Incredible.  This should be required reading in High School.
B000P2A24W|5.0|Well, well...so we have now a more melodic and soulful Bon Jovi here. It is OK. It is kind of impossible to keep the \\"New Jersey\\" and \\"Slippery When Wet\\" style forever. After twenty years of career, a growth in maturity was expected. I am not saying that their previous releases were good: they were simply a reflection of a different time whey they used to rock! Even being different now, they still rock!<br /><br />We - the Bon Jovi earliest fans - also have grown up, and so our musical tastes. What they did with \\"Lost Highway\\" was to keep up with the times. This is a good piece of recording and deserves praise and respect.<br /><br />It is beautifully written and arranged. A record that you just can't keep listeining after getting it. My personal favorites are: \\"Make a Memory\\", \\"Any Other Day\\" and \\"Everybody's Broken\\". The only track I often skip is \\"I Love This Town\\", to be honest.<br /><br />Avoid comparison with previous albums, because it's just not comparable. Leave all preconceptions behind and enjoy the ride over the Lost Highway!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I am typically not a sci-fi fan, however, because I love my husband, I agreed to go see this movie with him.  I was very skeptical and expected a boring weird movie.  Serenity is anything but!  It has a great story, the graphics are very believable and professionaly done.  The actors portray characters that are so humanly flawed, yet loyal and endearing.  We loved it so much we bought the complete Firefly series (the prequel to this) and Serenity the movie.  How we long for more from Joss Whedon!
B000OQF6N6|5.0|It seems that some time away from the spotlight made Billy Corgan and his band fellows to come out with all the rage they were keeping to themselves all this time and put a really raw and heavy material on the market.<br /><br />The fans they earned with \\"Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness\\" ballads and even with the odd \\"Adore\\" will certainly not recognize that SM they used to listen. This is by far the most agressive of their records and you know what? That sounds fantastic!<br /><br />Listening to the first two tracks - \\"Doomsday Clock\\" and \\"7 Shades of Black\\" - will provide one a simple introduction to what the rest of the album tastes. The word \\"Love\\" on \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" is deceiving: don't expect here a beautiful romance song, that one that you would play in the background with your loved one. By the way, Billy's ability to put soft lyrics into noisy songs is really impressive. He's done that before.<br /><br />Prepare your ears. It's been a long time since I last heard an album that almost left me deaf like this one. Rocks!
B00007KWHG|5.0|If you have fond memories of the 60's, and even if you don't, this music will make you sing! These songs were in the foreground and the background of our lives in those simpler times. I saw \\"Jersey Boys\\" on Broadway and this brings back that incredible sentimental journey back.  Listen and smile.
B000P2A256|5.0|So they're a pop band...some even call them a \\"boy band\\". But, so what as long as they play good music? Judging a book by its cover was never the best way to draw a conclusion.<br /><br />Musically speaking, this record is way much better than \\"Songs About Jane\\" in my opinion. It is clear that songs are now arranged and played in a more careful and sophisticated way. My picks are: \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", \\"Not Falling Apart\\" and \\"Back at Your Door\\". My guess is that if you hear at least these four tracks, you will notice a better and more mature Maroon 5, going to the right way and making their evolution.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Bought this CD after hearing \\"Wish I Could\\" on the radio; this is a gorgeous, hauntingly beautiful, moving song.<br /><br />I too am surprised to see the strongly negative reviews here. Her 3 CDs have sold more than 39 million copies worldwide, so there is clearly a strong fan base somewhere!  The added plus on this third CD is that Norah wrote or co-wrote every song, so we are gaining a glimpse into her musical soul as well as hearing the beauty of her voice.<br /><br />There are some real gems here.  \\"Sinkin' Soon\\" evokes 1930's jazz with its honky-tonk piano (played by Norah) and its wah-wah trombone. \\"Until the End\\" has country roots. \\"Not My Friend\\" is a mellow, dreamy, wistful song with dagger-sharp lyrics. \\"My Dear Country\\" is a lament about what election day hath wrought.  The final title cut, \\"Not Too late,\\" winds things up on an optimistic note.<br /><br />It is not surprising that Norah has good musical genes.  Her father, Ravi Shankar, brought his sitar to the Beatles and Indian music to a global audience.  Norah's seamless blending of country, jazz, blues, pop, and folk brings great talent and aural delight to a new musical generation.
B00005JMAH|3.0|As with all 5 of the HP movies, it just seems like way too much is going on:  too much special effects, too many characters, too many subplots, too much artificial and temperamental drama-and try as I might-my mind wanders and honestly I just don't care.  The characters, conventions, dialogue etc all seems like such stale unsurprising cliches: The horribly neglected and opressed orphan, the overachieving girl who ends up with the slacker goofy but sweet boy in loving bickering, the emotionally matrubatory almost soap opera drama queen dialogue over poorly drawn conflicts I can't keep track of, etc.  And none of Brittain's most aclaimed actors can save it.<br /><br />Perhaps the books are different and I'm just not a kid anymore.  I wanted to like HP, but I just couldn't make myself.  I can't be the only one.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|This is a pretty decent action movie. Mark Wahlberg does a good job in this role. The major plot line was pretty guessable from the beginning, but it didn't take away from the movie to me. I would have liked to have more information about his background, etc but that's just me.
1577314808|5.0|The author shows how we need to be completely conscious and aware of our thoughts and not let any negative thoughts slip in by keeping the subconscious mind at bay which is full of ego.    I do agree with others that this book is very repetitive and has its share of jargon but maybe that is what the author intended since we tend to remember more with repetition.    Overall a great book that everyone should read.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is going to be a strange review.  I bought this series in 2002 because I remember that few shows I saw I liked. It came in and I started watching and well I stopped after the third show. Time passed and the movie came out and I bought it,watched it, and I had my fill of FIREFLY. Then this summer{2007} I moved and as I packed I found my copiy of FIREFLY.  When I unpacked I put it out on the DVD player for later. Well after five years I got around to watching it.  I watched all 13 shows and the extras.  There are FIREFLY addicts out there who love this show as the Trekkies love STARTREK.   However I am not one of those, but I fell under FIREFLY's spell.  I really loved the characters, the ship, and the music. The later episodes were eye openers for me.  They contained subject matter that I never expected from this series.  For example Inara's love interest with another woman.  Mal's love scene with a madame.  The married couple preparing for battle and fighting over having a baby.  The last show about the bounty hunter really made me sad because it broght up things that I wanted anwers to, i.e when the bounty hunter said that Book was no shepard.  Remember the show when he got shot and produce his id and the Alliance went all respectfull?  River's deadly shooting was just beginning to show.  Well I could go on and on.  The point for a buyer is that this series was truly too good for tv and we will never see this type of show again. That is a shame.
B000P0J024|5.0|Music doesn't get any better than the Traveling Wilburys Collection.  The DVD is very interesting as well and it allows us to see the fun these legendary musicians were having and how that fun was reflected in their songs. Pick up this collection before it's too late.

0792839730|5.0|I saw a comment made on the first Google page about this movie that credits an \\"over acting\\" Elliot Gould as Major Julian Cook.  Julian Cook was played by ROBERT REDFORD who definitley did not \\"Over Act\\" in his part.  This is an extremely well done movie which is why I rated it the way I did.    I've read the other reviews and almost everyone comments that Ryan O'Neal was too young to play a general.  If anyone studies the history of World War II and the 82nd Airborne they would know that General James Gavin was 36 when he commanded at D-Day and Arnhem.  He got his second star at 37, which made him the youngest general to hold that rank since George Custer during the Civil War.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|This was a good movie but it could have been better with more info about the ghostrider.I like it but more plot and better villians would have made this a good movie .
B000E6ESL2|4.0|I thought it was a bit slow and monotonous for the first half, but the increasingly surrealistic visuals kept me going, then at the end, it all comes together quickly, very unpredictable, and very well done.  Couldn't believe it but I was thinking about the movie for about 45 minutes after it was over.  I recommend it.

B00001ZTFZ|3.0|This is very different from dave 'metal pioneer' mustaine and the band. if you a huge fan of their old stuff don't buy it but is you a music lover and want to hear something new, listen to this. maybe the correct concept album of this risk album is disco metal, yes the first disco metal album in the world.
B000001C6M|5.0|4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />It's not to say that Slayer didn't have a unique sound, but for points of reference I would say that this sounds like a cross between Metallica's \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and Venom's \\"Welcome to Hell\\".  Like the former, the album is extremely catchy without sounding the least bit commercial.  I'd say this was due to the fact that they were clearly influenced by NWOBHM which often has that same attribute.  The album is also quite dark like \\"Welcome to Hell\\" but it is less tongue-in-cheek and they avoid the silly (not an insult) \\"fun\\" songs that Venom likes to throw in every once in a while.  Both the guitarwork and drumming are amazing.  Although technically challenging to a good degree, they make sure to focus more on quality songwriting than showing off.  Also, the vocals are among the best among Slayer albums.  They're less angry than later on and a bit raspier.  Even if he's not technically a \\"good\\" singer by the traditional standards that your high school music teacher followed, the vocals are very fitting particularly because of the obvious Venom influence, plus he does the style well.  The album is not the band's lyrical peak, but the lyrics are decent.  They don't come off as honest or as brutal as on albums like \\"South of Heaven\\" and \\"Christ Illusion\\", but at the same time they don't totally wallow in the pseudo-Satanic cheese that was so popular at the time.  Okay, maybe there's just a hint of that.  The lyrics also occasionally deviate from the norm (how many bands have written about crionics?). Anyways, I would say this is one of the best debut albums of the 1980's thrash scene.  It's not as brutal as \\"Reign in Blood\\" nor as complex as \\"Hell Awaits\\" and the sound is slightly dated, but it has it's place and I can't imagine a serious metal freak not greatly enjoying this album.<br /><br />Also, there is no metal band that could be called more definitive in regards to underground metal.

B000001YOW|5.0|It started with their album Deadwing for me. After listening to that great disc I was hungry for more and starting gobbling up more albums from these talented British rockers. If you are not familiar with Porcupine Tree, I'm not sure I am qualified to pigeon-hole these guys even though I try in the title of this review. My Ipod / I-Tunes library automatically catogerized them as Alternative - whatever. What I can tell you is these guys are great and this is a good album to start with. It has some good mellow music turns to into rock tunes. Now I guess I can understand some of the comparisons to Pink Floyd because of the surreal portions of the melodies and then changinging into fullout rockers. I find that to be a good thing. The muscianship is stellar and holds up next to anybody you choose to compare! Normally, Porcupine Tree albums require at least 3 listens before the flower blooms, but this one opened up right away for me. I highly recommend this album . Later PT albums lean a tad harder on the rock side than this one I think. Some portions of this disc reminds me of theme music from a cool movie. Other notable discs to consider are In Absentia, Deadwing and Fear of a Blank Planet. Each one is worthy of your attention. Ciao.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We LOVE to watch Firefly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We cannot figure out why they would have discontinued the series!?!?! It has good acting, always makes you laugh (even when you've seen it many times), and leaves you with a good feeling inside. It's addicting. Once you watch the first one, you don't want to stop until you've seen them all! And 'Serenity', the movie to 'end' the series is a must see - but only after you've watched all the Firefly episodes!! A show the whole sci-fi-loving family can enjoy!
B000I9X50U|5.0|twice i have watched this movie, and i must say it is a good movie. all the actors are excellent in it. special mention are Bernice and Christina, they both nearly steal the show.  however, the neurotic woman (tea leoni) is not half bad either ... the whole story line is great. personal values; intergrating with adopted new country yet trying to preserve own birthplace' identity; and NOT keeping up with the joneses; bringing up children in a fast-pace materialistic world; understanding your children, husband; mother/daugther relations = flor/christina;mrs.clasky/bernice;mrs.clasky/mrs.clasky's mother. for those who hv yet to watch this movie or who hesitate to watch it because of negative reviews ... ignore them - do watch it with an open mind. you'll be pleasantly surprised.
0140292918|5.0|If you haven't read it, you are to be envied. This is one of the great, rare little literary gems that'll break your heart. It's impossible to read this without feeling that you have finally accomplished something, like seeing the Grand Canyon or crossing the Atlantic. It is a beautiful tale, written with great economy, and incredibly has little or no purpose beyond its universe of emotional trial and loss. There is no ideological mission, no politically correct mission. There is no propaganda, which is an incredible thing, given its subject matter. Here we have the real McCoy. In case you had forgotten why books were written or why people read them, take the afternoon off and give this a whirl. You've got two characters, there is lots of love, and then there is a killing.
B000002GBJ|5.0|After having been thoroughly impressed with Rick Wakeman's [[ASIN:B000002GA8 Journey to the Centre of the Earth]], I picked up \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII,\\" based mostly on the positive reviews here at Amazon. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed. This is Rick's debut album as a solo artist and, in my opinion, it stands shoulder to shoulder with his work from Yes. Each of the six tracks (all of which are instrumental) have their own unique sound. Mr. Wakeman is a master keyboard player, and this album makes that quite apparent. If you enjoy progressive rock, you should own this album.

0064430227|5.0|This was one of my favorites as a child.  I can't count the number of times I read this book, then got out my crayons and drew my own worlds.<br /><br />I've been reading this book to my son since he was two weeks old.  The simple illustrations captivated his attention, and he would lean against my chest, stare at the pictures, and listen to my voice.  Such a precious moment.  He briefly lost interest when he was concentrating on getting where he wanted to go, then came back around to it.  Sometimes he'd carry it to me saying \\"weed, mommy.\\"  He's four now, and we still enjoy reading it together.<br /><br />It's been wonderful to see his reactions change as he gets older.  This is one of those stories with many layers, so children of all ages will find something new.  Such a fabulous book.
B00005JPQT|3.0|\\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" sounds like a recipe for disaster.  It's directed by Len Wiseman, whose only previous credit worth mentioning is that he directed the \\"Underworld\\" movies.  It co-stars Justin Long, the obnoxious star of films like \\"[[ASIN:B000IZJZIU Accepted]].\\"  The plotline involves John McClane taking on computer hackers.  And the kicker?  It's rated PG-13.<br /><br />So imagine fans' surprise when the film begins receiving rave reviews, many calling it the best \\"Die Hard\\" since [[ASIN:B000O76T90 the original film]].  It enters the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list.  It begins raking in the cash.  It's a hit.  Knowing all this, I went into \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" with reasonable expectations and high hopes.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I came out disappointed.  It's not that four \\"Die Hard\\" films is too many, nor that Bruce Willis has lost his touch.  A fourth \\"Die Hard\\" film could easily be stellar with a good writer and a talented director, and despite his age, Willis is just as cool as ever.  The first problem, and perhaps the most important one, is the rating.  For a PG-13 rating, the movie packs quite a punch, but the preceding films were known for their violence and profanity.  Willis' constant dropping of \\"F-bombs\\" was a big part of what made John McClane so appealing, because it emphasized that he was just an ordinary guy thrown into extraodinary situations.  As for the violence, it was part of what made the series so rough n' tough.  The worst part of it all is that it's clear executives pushed for a PG-13 to make more money, much like what they did with Paul W.S. Anderson's foolish \\"[[ASIN:B000AP04P6 AVP: Alien vs. Predator]].\\"<br /><br />Now, without the ability to curse freely, John McClane seems a lot more quiet, a lot less ordinary, and more of a typical action hero.  He recalls Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name with his reserved cool and unflinching ability to kill.  Sure, McClane has his more down-to-earth moments, like talking to himselfas he drives a car off a ramp and into a helicopter, and these are his best.  Fortunately, Willis has enough starpower to keep the character interesting, and make what we get of his trademark phrase, totaling \\"Yippi-ki-yay, mo--,\\" hit home.<br /><br />The next problem: Len Wiseman.  Wiseman gives the film an honest effort, but he just doesn't quite fit.  He has style, but it's not the right style.  Wiseman's approach is slick and refined, unlike the gritty, tough, no-holds-barred style of previous directors John McTiernan and Renny Harlin.  Wiseman can't effectively handle tension, though he proves he's adept at effects-spectacular action sequences.  For the most part, though, they're just popcorn stuff.  There's no build-up, no surprise, no real structure to it: it's just smooth, effects-laden visuals.<br /><br />From Wiseman, all the other problems just sort of fold out.  The cast is young, fresh, and attractive, fitting Wiseman's general-audience approach.  Timothy Olyphant is a remarkably unmenacing villain when compared to Alan Rickman, Jeremy Irons, or William Sadler.  As predicted, Justin Long certainly has moments of obnoxiousness, but not unbearably so; still, a different actor could have done better in the role.  On the upside, Maggie Q adds some spark to her role, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead's zesty turn as McClane's daughter is fun.<br /><br />Mark Bomback's script is a big problem - it's dull, predictable, and by-the-books.  It lacks the originality of \\"Die Hard,\\" the hopelessness of \\"Die Hard 2,\\" the tension of \\"Die Hard: With a Vengeance.\\"  The plot is thin and the scenes feel like they're just there to set up the action sequences.  To give some credit to Wiseman, he has enough skill to take the audience's mind off the lackluster plot line and keep them involved in the action.<br /><br />As a big fan of the previous entries, I really wanted to like \\"Live Free or Die Hard.\\"  The cast and crew do put in honest efforts, but it just doesn't fit.  It feels like what it is, essentially: a PG-13 action sequel for the summer blockbuster season.  As your everyday action film, it delivers, but as a \\"Die Hard\\" film, it falls flat.  If there is one thing to praise the film for, it's the message that an old-fashioned hero like John McClane can still make a difference in our technology-ruled modern world.  But \\"Live Free or Die Hard,\\" perhaps more fittingly titled \\"Die Hardly,\\" will make a difference only to the most die-hard of \\"Die Hard\\" fans.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Crybaby is an essential John Waters film.  It's a musical set in the fifties with Johnny Depp and Ricki Lake.  It's by John Waters, so you know it's going to be funny.  And it is.  It's the height of camp and fun and just wonderful!    Buy it!

B000O179EA|5.0|When i first saw The Frightners back when it was released theatrically I knew I was watching a film by a complete nut/brilliant filmaker.  Who would have know that the director of this film would go on to make the Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong.  It's evident in The Frightners that Jackson is a director with great assurance in his work.  I'm just sad that this film didn't find an audience when it was first released.  But now that Jackson is a big league director this film will not only profit from its cult followers,but from a new generation of viewers.  This new director's cut is filled with spectacular unseen footage that is totally necessary and doesn't just make the film longer for show.  The HD-DVD presentation is crisp and flawless and has plenty of extras.  Sit back and enjoy Pet6er Jackson's difinitive version of his pre-Lord of the Rings gem.
1582701709|1.0|I love the idea of the secret of the power of the mind but I dont think this book compliments it very well. It instead informercializes this idea of \\"wishful thinking.\\" On the other hand, it did have some good thoughts but the approach they used to get the message across cheapend it.
0679809015|3.0|I like this book but it is really small. I was hoping for a good bedtime book but this one has ended up in the car for independent reading. The kids have a hard time with the flaps because they are really small. There are better lift the flap books with farm animals out there.
0316067598|5.0|The story really got interesting after wading thru 170 odd pages of anti liberal media rants and GW Bush is a real \\"tough guy\\" statements. Courage and bravery are not a right wingers sole possession. Nore is Bush, after going AWOL during the Vietnam war, an ideal example of neo -con bravery.   The story of these SEAL heroes must be told, but sadly it's too bad the writer put so much right wing political bravado in it.  I give the book five gold stars because of the men who died deserve it. I want to know more about what happened to the village after the US military left. Did the villagers have to survive Taliban/Al Queda reprisals? The epilogue should have expanded upon their lives, that is the lives of the brave Afgani villagers who are such a big portion of the story but received so little credit. Marcus Luttrell must go back and do something like what mountain climber Greg Mortenson did in \\"Three Cups of Tea\\", build schools to counter the Wahabbi fundamentalists and their extreamism. Also what eventually happened to \\"Sharmak\\".
B000IU3XTW|5.0|With this CD, the Foo Fighters prove beyond any doubt, or argument, that they're the real deal. Grohl can write and arrange for any style and get impressive results. Beautiful, melodic arrangements that are perfectly executed by the band, this disc gives you a new perspective of the Foo Fighters. Only time will tell for sure, but I think this will become a classic.<br /><br />As for the sound quality: It's mastered a little too loud, resulting in some compression, but it's not bad. I think Grohl has enough control in the entire process that he doesn't allow the record company boys to ruin his work. Good for him.
1594489505|5.0|Sometimes I plough through a book because I like the author.  And sometimes the book is worth the time.  Other times I've read books which were really good and worth passing on to friends.  These I sometimes get back, after I pester them a bit.  Once in a great while a great book comes along which takes me by surprise like a dustdevil played out against a windshield.  Suddenly the world is blotted out and you are alone with whatever next may come.  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is just such a read.   I didn't think I would be much interested in a dusty desert story of modern war.   I also didn't expect the characters to become a part of my family, beaconing me back to their lives many times in my day.   I don't remember shedding tears profusely before reading this story.  Although it is a novel, I wonder how many people's stories are actually being told.  There are so many who didn't have an author to write for them.  This is one of the best (if not best) books I have ever read, and as an English teacher that covers a mass piece of literary real estate. And I don't think I will be lending it out.
B00003CXAA|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection]]I mostly like chick flicks, but the Godfather movies are the best I have seen.  One is great, two is the best, and three isn't that great, but you need to see all of them to see how things started and ended.  Two gives you a real history of how the Don became the head of the powerful family.  I have it on tape, but I bought the DVD collection for my new grandson.  He is now 15.  He likes gangster movies and I know he will like this one.  Not for small children.  Lots of killing and blood.  These movies are timeless.  The first was made in 1972 and the second was made in 1974, and I still like them.  Marlon Brando and Robert DiNero both won oscars for the same role of Don Vito.  Amazon also had the best price.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|I am a fan of an album that can tell a story from beginning to end. I think this album does that. I listen to something from this album almost every day. I have it on my shuffle while I run. It always makes me smile and pick up the pace a little. I think, \\"I wonder what the person on the treadmill next to me is listening to; because, it can't compare to this.\\" I just love each song more and more everytime I hear it.<br />I bought this and Sing the Sorrow at the same time. I do have to say; I think Sing the Sorrow has more angst/ possibly emotion but this album has more of a cohesive story.<br />I think they are one of the best bands of the current music scene. There are alot of duds out there!
B000000OF6|5.0|I really started to like Queen recently.  Bohemian rhapsody is such a great song and really gets you moving.  My husband likes running to this music.  I am still getting used to some of the other songs, but I really like this CD.  Whenever I listen to We Are the Champions, I think of the episode of Cheers when all of the bar boys pounded on the bar to this song.  It's fun.  As always, Amazon seems to have the best prices.  I don't have to pay shipping or tax and save an additional dollar or two on top of that.

0553213105|5.0|I had to read \\"Emma\\" for my high school sophomore English class and was pretty much the only one who enjoyed it at all.  Recently, free this summer from required reading, I decided to try \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  The first few chapters are slow and a bit dry, but the action soon picks up pace (as action and Austen go).  Austen's characters are brilliantly drawn and her observations in situations are astute.  The reader has the advantage of being the most nearly omniscient observer and knows throughout the book what the ending will be but still agonizes over the process of it happening.  Some readers like me may be slightly annoyed that (like \\"Emma\\") the happiness of the characters hinges on love and marriage and nothing else, but in the end you'll be so swept up in the story that nothing else matters but the happy ending.

B00003CXXP|5.0|If you thought that Haley Joel Osment was nomination worthy in `The Sixth Sense' then sit back and watch this young child mature because he's award worthy in this masterpiece of a film.  `A.I.' may just be my favorite film of 2001, or at least very close to it, and it's shocking to me since when I first saw it I didn't remember being blown away.  It wasn't until I picked it up for a steal the other day and decided to give it another try that I realized just how amazing this film really is.  It may be flawed, but they're flaws I can't see.  Everything is cinematically superior to most the films released today.  The set pieces, the cinematography, the originality, the dialog, the emotions, the brilliant acting and Spielberg's classic direction all add layers to the finesse the film contains.  Adapted from the short story `Supertoys Last all Summer Long' written by Brain Aldiss, and then crafted by the legendary Stanley Kubrick only to be interpreted by Stephen Spielberg is quite a nice list of names t throw in the bucket, and the finished product lives up to it.<br /><br />The film, as has been mentioned, is a futuristic look at the tale of `Pinocchio'.  Young David, a robot child, longs to be a real boy in order to experience a real love from his mother.  His parents, Monica and Henry Swinton, adopted him after their only son Martin got sick and was hospitalized.  The doctors couldn't find a way to cure the boy and so, in order to help heal the pain, the couple decided to adopt a robot boy designed to love unconditionally.  The mother, while against the idea at first, soon falls in love with David and he with her.  But then Martin gets better and comes home and things change.  The attention and affection that Monica once gave to David now went to Martin, and Martin continued to resent David and try his hardest to make him falter.<br /><br />After a series of accidents Monica is forced to part with David, but her love for him is so strong that she can't send him back to the factory for destruction.  She leaves him in the woods with his supertoy Teddy and warns him of the cruel world, sending him on his way to face it alone.  David then devotes his energies to finding the Blue Fairy from the `Pinocchio' fable in order to become a real boy and thus win the love of his mother.  Along his journey he meets Gigolo Joe, played by Jude Law, a robot lover who's on the run from the law and so decides to help David on his journey.  The film beautifully moves from scene to scene and effortlessly captures our attention and emotions, attaching us to David and forcing us to understand and root for him.<br /><br />The acting is superb; everyone involved delivering an award worthy performance.  Jude Law is great as Joe, his charisma is a great attribute to the film and is a perfect compliment to Osment's wide eyed innocence.  Frances O'Connor is just utterly fantastic as Monica.  Her emotions are so raw and real that the audience is moved to tears for her character predicament.  As she leaves David alone in the woods we can feel her remorse and her destitution.  This is her son no matter what anyone else says about it.  The star though is none other than Haley Joel Osment who just delivers flawless brilliance here.  The transition scene alone, when his mother reads to him the few random words that attach him forever to her, is enough to hand him an Oscar.  His facial expression, from wonderment and excitement to awe and complete affection is so strong and mature its tear inducing.  `A.I.' is just about flawless and is sure to entertain and sympathize with the audience.  Truly masterful and completely absorbing, beautifully shot and brilliantly directed!to the factory for destruction.

B000O178BY|5.0|This thought-provoking collection includes the anti-Bush radio hit \\"Capital G\\".  Trent expands on his angry alter-industrial format with more vocal pyrotechnics than on his previous releases.  A must have for all NIN fans with moody shifts in dynamics interspersed with melodic white noise.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|I've noticed recently that alot of today's modern rock is so heavily influence by 80's music.  A few years ago it was easy to make fun of Duran Duran, The Smiths, and The Cure as cheesy 80's music.  Listen to The Killers, and Franz Ferdinand.  Morrisey and Duran Duran are Brandon Flowers(of The Killers) favorite bands. Listen to Rio and you'll see it.  I find it ironic that the same people who make fun of Duran Duran love Hot Fuss.
B000002H6C|5.0|No band  has held such a highly regarded position in the canon of rock history and then completely fallen from grace like Metallica.  Metallica is arguably the most hated rock band of all time and it's all there fault.  They raised the bar incredibly high with four undisputed metal masterpieces in a row to start their career, but then decided to quit blowing our minds with complex operatic metal and turn accessible.  Not to mention Napster, but I don't want to pile on.        ...And Justice for All is one of the most contentious of all Metallica albums among fans.  Some fans feel that ...And Justice for All is a logical progression of the bands early sound, starting with the full on thrash of Kill Em All, the complex and darker music on Ride the Lightning,  the even more complex and darker music on Master of Puppets, and finally the mind blowing complexity of ...And Justice for All.  Others feel that it's the start of the bands long decline to the most hated band in the world.  Still others feel that it's a self consciously difficult album that the band put out to prove that they can still make mind blowing music like Master of Puppets after the backbone of their band Cliff Burton passed away.  I tend to think it's the first of these three explanations.       ...And Justice for All is above all a difficult record.  It's long, complicated, pessimistic, and it sounds like the band is playing in a cave.  ...And Justice for All is a monolith of a record.  The title track is the perfect example of just how complex the arrangements on this album are.  The song spans close to 10 minutes with unique and complex riffs, solos, and various other guitar pyrotechnics.   The song is famously difficult to play live, and the band kept it out of its live repertoire for 18 years.  The song begins with a clean guitar lick.  It lulls the listener in to a sense of calm before it hits with the fireworks.  The song careens from there with at least four separate guitar solos.  It's exhausting to say the least.      Most of the songs feature complex riffs and solos, usually several per song.  The two best songs on the album are probably the two simplest songs (I use the term subjectively, a simple Metallica song incredibly complex for almost any other band), One and Harvester of Sorrow.  These songs are still highly arranged and complicated, but they have a straight ahead melody that really sticks in your head.      Despite it's reputation as an incredibly heavy album, ...And Justice for All sounds like it was recorded in a cave.  Everything sounds dry on it.  The guitars are heavy for sure, but they sound lifeless.  The drums don't have any power behind them, they click more than thud.  And there is little to no bass guitar at all on the album.  This was the first album Jason Newsted played on and the band was notoriously hard on him.  Maybe mixing him out completely was a way to show that they didn't really want him.  When you listen to this next to Master of Puppets, it's painfully evident just how wimpy this album sounds.      But putting the complaints about the production aside, ...And Justice for All is a classic metal album and the last truly great Metallica album.  Most interviews with the band say that this album was the tipping point for them.  They felt that the songs were too demanding and complex for listeners and too hard to play live.  After this they stripped everything away and made radio friendly rock.  But it's hard not admire what they created on this album.  It's not that it's an incredibly enjoyable listen, but I marvel at the technical virtuosity and the bombastic monolithic sound.  It's like reading a Thomas Pynchon novel, it's almost too complex for its own good, but I still marvel at its creation, wondering how they pulled something like this off.  I still think it's a bit of an over reach though.  The band was trying for something symphonic and they end up getting close, but not quite making a transcendent record.  Still, the tap solo on One always makes me smile.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|The one film that sticks out in my mind as the best movie of 2006 is The Pursuit of Happyness starring Will Smith. This movie is based on a book of the same title authored by Chris Gardner.    In the movie, Gardner is a medical product salesman who ends up splitting up with his wife and ends up homeless with his 5 year-old son. Determined to not give up, Gardner endures homelessness and ends up pursuing an internship for a stockbroker position at a major Wall Street investment firm. Despite the trials and tribulations Gardner went through, not only due to the lack of a roof over his head but also the hard work related to his internship and even an IRS seizure of his money to boot, Gardner's endurance and hard work pays off.    The movie, and I am sure the book, is a testament to how anyone can get themselves out of poverty and become wealthy with hard work, persistence  and determination. Gardner had an even bigger reason to work hard due to the need for him to provide a good life for his son.    The story of Chris Gardner's going from rags to riches is an inspiration for us all and all of the elements of this film makes for one heckuva great flick!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|About as close to perfection as any movie I have ever viewed. The slow pace, as with Lonesome Dove, is vital to allow the friendship to grow and to give us a perspective on the time involved in this amazing story.    I hope but am unsure if the 15 extra minutes of Morgan Freeman that I once saw (on Showtime or HBO) is included. It was mind boggling ... was bonus material where Morgan is managing freedom but losing hope. MUCH more than what is in the movie and so wonderfully acted! I saw it that one time long ago and have never even heard mention of that omitted long scene. I would POSITIVELY include that footage in any special release as fans such as myself would love it. It was all narative and struck deep into the soul of this man as he attempted to hold on.    Looking forward to this set regardless ... what a film folks! Music, pace, acting, script, story and cinematography and so on ... can't say enough about this film.     That Forrest Gump took all the honors and made the big money that same year while this classic was basically overlooked now looks as silly as it actually was. This movie goes deep and it's theme blossomed beautifully.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|many movie critics and movie goers really trashed this movie, but i went openi anng weekend and saw it for my birthday,and loved it!. stephen sommers always makes great action and special effects movies and this one was no different. everyone talked about how dumb it was,excuse me! its a special effects/fantasy/adventure summer movie not a serious dramatic film did people forget that?. it was fun,period!. the effects were great,from the sexy,scary crazy brides of dracula,to the seen of anna valerious descending up to heaven. looooved dracula, richard roxburgh played him as sexy arrogant over the top dracula, personally the best dracula yet!. the brides were great too,rather than stand around looking beautiful and wait for leftovers from drac they got out there and caused some trouble themselves!. the masquerade ball scenes were incredible!, buy the dvd and watch the making of this elaborate scene. draculas castle and the secret mirror entrance was cool, the werewolf was pretty cool,,more realistic and scarrier than most i have seen.the action scenes were a bit intense in that it never ends,yes i even thibk stephen s. could have cut back on some of it!, and some of it really,really was unrealistic,but it was an action movie and you do get you moneys worth here!. i would have preffered alittle less action and more dialog and that he delved deeper into van helsings past and his connection with dracula. all in all it is fun and a much better movie than everyone was saying about it. so buy it, get the popcorn ,turn off the lights, and get ready for some heartpounding relentless action! and enjoy!!!.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This Series Collection of Planet Earth is excellent!  I had seen the episodes on the Discovery Channel in HD narrated by Sigourney Weaver and had to buy the set.  I bought it as a gift to my boyfriend who really loves it too!  Buy this only if you have an HD DVD player & TV.  It's specific to this type of player.  The only downside I have to mention is that the narrator isn't Sigourney Weaver.  That's the only thing I didn't expect but it is still a 5-star item!  Enjoy it!
B00005R23X|5.0|i love this movie! i have owned it for many years and seen it probably 20 times. i think its the most accurate versionthat sticks closely to book which i have read many,many times.the romance between dracula and mina is a new twist to the story it doesnt hurt it but men might want to gag at the sight of dracula acting like a love sick teenager but come on guys you have done the same thing at one time!. coppolla putting strong emphasis on the costumes and then the sets was correct because,you get a stronger sense of the characters that wear them. lucys eleborate sexy dresses and pegnoirs reveal her to be a spoiled only child with money to burn and that she can do and say whatever she wants and get away with it all.. and that shes also bored having it all,thats how dracula lures her and traps her into vampirism. the character of reinfield is another good example, dressed in  his long undearwear and tailed gentelmens coat, it tells you of a gentelman fighting insanity and losses. the cinemaphotography is very beautiful and deep and rich with color and the old school movie effects complements the movie well. i loved it and anyone who loved the book and or just costumes and gothic romance will love it too. the only thing i did not like was the casting of keanu reeves!,he was so stiff and uncomfortable,so ill at ease you can see it thru out the movie! but ignore him and concentrate on the others ecspecially, anthony hopkins as the wildly eccentric van helsing and gary oldmans sympathetic dracula and sadie frosts girlish, sometimes wanton lucy westenra and tom waites mad,sad reinfield and indeed you will have a great viewing of the best dracula movie in decades!.
B00008973A|5.0|One of the best musicals of Broadway!!! I love this movie, the songs, the characters, everything. THis movie shows a little bit of the hard work that actors, dancers and singers have to do in order to be in the theatre world. We have to give a great value to all the work that theatre actors made in order to show a great performance on stage. As an actor I should say that being on stage is one of the best sensations, as this movie sings it! One singular Sensation!!!
0316067598|4.0|A very good account draws one into the depths of Seal training and the specific mission Operation Redwing. I couldn't put the book down even knowing the ultimate outcome.  It gave a perspective on the enemy we are facing as well as our own crippling limitations.  The media's impact on soldiers' safety and conduct of the war is disheartening.
0446677450|4.0|This book is definitely a start to creating financial intelligence. I agree with Kiyosaki that it takes a change in your mindset in order for you to become rich.

1591841666|5.0|Seth Godin eloquently yet succinctly describes the logical reasons to quit, or not to quit.  His voice is strong and direct, leading the reader to see the truth of their struggle.  He separates our fear of quitting and settling for mediocre from our obligation to strive for extraordinary.  He illustrates solid reasons for not settling.  This book should be required reading for any small business owner who will inevitably reach The Dip.  I'll be recommending it to all of my coaching clients.

B000PFUAO6|2.0|For a long time, Dream Theater was a band that could almost do no wrong.  From the late 80's through 2002, almost everything they touched turned to gold, but over the last five years, they have spiraled downhill, and \\"Systematic Chaos\\" is their latest debacle.      Like its predecessor, \\"Octavarium,\\" I went through stages early on of liking it a lot as well as not liking it that much, but, in both cases, with the exception of a couple of songs from both, over time, I ended up finding both to be very forgettable, though both are at least better than the train wreck better known as \\"Train of Thought.\\"     One of the biggest problems with \\"Systematic Chaos\\" is the production.  I understand that the band had problems with multiple producers early in their career, which is why they prefer to self-produce their own records now, but, to this listener, that isn't working very well.  They need that outside voice to tell them when they have gone too far or when enough is enough.  Take \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\" for example.  Overall, I like this song quite a bit, as the main melody is very good and memorable, and the vocal passages are extremely good and well-delivered by singer James LaBrie, but smack dab in the middle of the song is an extended, flashy instrumental section that sounds completely out of place.  An outside producer most likely would have the wherewithal to have suggested that they leave that instrumetal section out in favor of a much shorter, concise, and fitting one.  But, left to their own devices, the band kept it in there, and the song sounds rather disjointed at times.  Too many of their songs over the last few albums have a similar problem.      Also, the lyrics, which had been slowly slipping over the years, especially since the departure of original keyboardist Kevin Moore, are at an all-time worst.  Creating a two-part, 25-minute plus epic about a dark master is one of the worst ideas the band has ever had.  Every time they sing the dark master line, I almost laugh and shake my head.  I can deal with average or even subpar lyrics, but I find listening to laughably bad lyrics to be painful, and the majority of the lyrics on this record fall under that category.      In general, Dream Theater is probably one of the most polarizing bands of the last 15 years; people either seem to love them or hate them.  For the longest time, I loved this band, and while I certainly do not hate them now, I find most of their newer music to be uninspired, generic, and just not very memorable.  But, like I said, the band seems to be happy, and thanks to their new contract with Roadrunner, their fan base seems to be expanding, so more power to them, I guess.
B000PY52EU|4.0|This movie starts real rough. There is no story, just a sexually active and depressed young woman (sorry for the pc lingo, but to describe it any other way would be a little crass). I am sure you already know where this is going. Yes, we have a woman who was molested when she was young. Along the way of just trying to get by, she is beaten and left for dead by one of her fianc&eacute;'s friends. A lonely farmer, who was left by his wife for his brother, finds her. He decides that he will cure her of her wickedness. He chains her to the radiator, so she will not get away. Along the way she is cured, and so is he. At the finish of the film, everyone makes it to a new position in their lives. They finally have the chance to live without their demons. The movie is well shot, but a little gratuitous in its portrayal of living with abuse.
B000FGFSWE|5.0|This is an amazing DVD, I enjoyed it very much this whole concert performance does not get boring for one minute, bands like this deserve more radio play here in the states. This is a must have for any Nightwish fan. I also have the CD that came with this its all top notch. Another thing I really enjoyed was the performance by John Two-Hawks, being Native American myself of Cherokee/Apache decent it was great to see how our culture was embraced by another country, and the aw on their faces when he performed.  GREAT DVD AND CD..I RECOMMEND IT FOR EVERY NIGHTWISH FAN!
B000LP6KSU|1.0|This isn't clean. What you get is a shorter version of Welcome to the Black Parade, all swears intact (including F-Bombs), and the sense that you just waisted money.

1416523359|1.0|What happened to SK? The master of epic horror in everyday life? This cuddly-sweet lover's lingo turned my stomach to the point where I could not even focus on the story. Who talks like this? \\"Little Lisey of mine...I was hot; SO HOT!...and you brought me ice.\\" ?? Who besides Barbara Streisand in \\"Prince of Tides\\" can lay claim to such overwrought language. This writer who is supposed to be the love of her/our(?) life comes across as a whiny selfish effeminate bluecollar wannabe. Answering his fans with lines like \\"No can do Brother\\". It surpised me that King should paint the writer in these unflattering terms, since it is obvious that the writer is King (like always). Maybe he thought this was a likelable heroic portrait.  Is King even still actually writing these novels? Or does he throw out the germ of an idea every week or two and then the apprentices, all versed in \\"King\\" jump to action; filling the pages with \\"King\\".

B000NA1OXY|3.0|Sort of disappointing.  Different energy on this one, oh wait...she's happy now, and the music tells all. I enjoyed the fact that I could find solace in her music and curse men and the world all in one bitter lyric.  We all can't be happy all the time and it seems it's getting harder to find people to sing about that.  Oh well.
B000HA4WT8|1.0|What can I say?  The original \\"Fast and the Furious\\" was sort of ridiculous, but did make a mark in the modern genre of action movies that involve decked/tricked out cars. \\"2 Fast, 2 Furious\\" was a lackluster sequel, but at least there was a conduit from the first movie with Paul Walker starring in it.  But this movie, \\"Tokyo Drift\\" was the most holistic form of cinematic crap I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />The plot is that an American teenager Sean, played by Lucas Black (who has a southern accent that sounds so fake, yet in reality it isn't) is sent to live with his father in Tokyo.  This happens after he again breaks the law for racing and wrecking cars after a languid day of high school.  So he moves to Tokyo so he can be reformed, have a better attitude, bring his grades up and stay away from fast cars.  Nevertheless, this instigator of plot never really seems to be addressed or resolved.  The fact that Sean had no friends or family anywhere else closer than Tokyo still seems dubious.  Any who, Sean is up to his old tricks again with cars faster than you can say \\"Goodyear\\" once he moves in with daddy.<br /><br />As for this 105 minute (which felt much longer) bowel movement in still life had many interesting elements.  For instance, I found it so interesting that all the Japanese students pretty much treat their native tongue like a second language and English as a first.  Also every Japanese teenage girl that has an interest in cars is unbelievably sexy and hot.  The only fashion and music in Tokyo is hip hop.  It appears that none of these Japanese teenagers work, but their cars cost more that some of the projects NASA funds.  Japanese mob members seem to have too much interest in teenage activities.  Also the technique of \\"drifting\\" displayed in this movie is physically impossible to perform with a car, unless your car is created by Q (from the James Bond films).  It is also pretty safe to say there is more computer graphics in this movie than a Pixar/Disney film.<br /><br />Bow Wow?  Bow Wow?  Bow Wow?  Bow Wow? Bow Why? What in the world was the point of him in this movie?  All he did was produce comic relief, that wasn't funny at all and sell knockoff/bootleg sneakers and iPods.  His presence could have been removed and it wouldn't have influenced the frail plot that was sadly placed.  Also why did Vin Diesel agree to be in this movie, but refused to be in \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\"?  Not that \\"2 Fast 2 Furious\\" was great, but it was an Oscar winner compared to \\"Tokyo Drift\\".  It isn't like Vin Diesel is some true thespian actor, just watch XXX, so why didn't he include himself in these movies some more.  After all didn't the \\"Fast and the Furious\\" really introduce Vin to mainstream American audiences?  I guess being in a sequel is beneath Vin.  As for Vin Diesel's cameo, he looked like the make-up crew got a little jiggy with the Max Factor or something, because Vin looked like a woman.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want to laugh at a poor attempt to cash in to this franchise, watch \\"Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\".  It really is entertaining, but not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.  In contrast, there is one of the most creative but ridiculous plug ins/product placements I have ever seen in a movie.  The item is Tabasco sauce and it is thrown in the most outrageous, idiotic, and lame and \\"you have got to be kidding me\\" situations I have ever seen in a movie.  You have been warned.film.

The item is Tabasco sauce and it is thrown in the most outrageous, idiotic, and lame and \\"you have got to be kidding me\\" situations I have ever seen in a movie.  You have been warned.
014305841X|4.0|Not having much time for reading books, I picked this up on CD.  At times the book drones on about something which I found it fairly easy to tune out.  Some of the details I found very interesting ... but suffice to say that on no subject did I find myself needing to reference to another place for more information (save where to find food locally).<br /><br />Overall, the message was pretty interesting and my wife and I changed many of our eating habits.  I also now tend to avoid anything with \\"high fructose corn syrup\\".
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I remember hearing that this movie was so scary and disturbing from a friend of mine.  That it is one of the first real creepy movies of the 21st century.  I am here to tell you that this is the one of the dumbest and low grade movies I have seen in a long time.  As a matter of fact I was laughing out loud at how stupid it was. I honestly don't care if Quentin Tarantino's name is attached to this movie \\"Hostel\\" was awful and dreadful.  Now the R rating has its merit, there is plenty of gore, language and nudity.  Nevertheless, this made the movie even more hysterical than it already was.  Plenty of dummies, fake body parts, dummies, over the top violence for shock value only, dummies and lame dialogue had my friend (different from the one who said this movie was great) and me rewinding parts saying \\"Please I have got to see that again, but I need to pay the water bill first\\"!<br /><br />Also I love the picture of Europe this movie portrayed: get high all day, all European women are drop dead gorgeous and want to have sex 24/7.  Also when in Europe, it is okay to have problems and/or frustrations, be obnoxious and state things better work in your favor because you are an American.<br /><br />This movie tried so hard to be scary and creepy.  I suppose there is an element of the \\"hidden\\" plot that was creepy.  However, a very slow opening forty minutes, lead characters that I could really take or leave (Jay Hernandez was real vexing in this movie) and unbelievable circumstances made this film a real lemon.  This also killed any element of creepiness that might have been a threat. Also the movie tried to wrap everything up in twenty seconds at the end, which was really weak.<br /><br />One of the features on the DVD is a \\"Making of Hostel\\" documentary.  I found this really enjoyable how the film makers are so proud of this so called masterpiece they made.  You wondered what went wrong between the documentary and the finished product.  I guess this movie was considered so great because most horror movies made today are rated PG-13.  This movie is rated R, so this allows a great deal of more gore and violence, which of course makes a great horror movie.  However, this movie plays more like a comedy than a horror movie, did I mention the dummies.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|... and this is one of them.  It should probably be watched twice to get the most out of it.  First watch it to gain the general outline and progress of the story, relax and let it flow.  There is some predictability to it but the same could be said about Moby Dick in the last analysis.  Watch it first for the pleasure of it.<br /><br />Then watch it for edification.  Like another very under-rated work, Paul Newman's \\"Mr. & Mrs. Bridge\\", it asks serious questions about the difference between \\"living\\" and \\"existing.\\"  Listen carefully as Dustin Hoffman's character explains the essence of tragic and comedic literature and how they depict life.  This film seeks to find a balance between personal choice and \\"fate\\" and how one governs one-self in the face of it.  If we distill it further, it challenges us to consider how we would govern ourselves if we knew the story of our own lives and whatever good might come out of it, even the tragic aspects.<br /><br /> Good movies do much more than entertain.
B00005JMYI|1.0|I thought this movie was awful.  I've heard lots of people say it was great. The reviews on here are mixed.  One quarter of the way through the movie and I started watching it at 1.4x speed.  Half way through I turned it off.  I joked around that on my next scuba diving trip I would leave this movie at the bottom of the ocean and take pictures of it as I swam away.  But, I don't litter in the sea so I sent it to my brother. He probably hates me for it.  I still love Will Farrell and will watch his other movies.
B00008OE4W|5.0|This is such an entertaining film, but how often do you stumble across it on one of the movie channels, or any channel for that matter? Great ensemble cast, lots of humor, but still enough plot and drama to satisfy a wide range of movie watchers. Each of the characters (the \\"good guys\\") has his or her quirks that makes each one memorable, and also invaluable in some way to getting the job done. One premise, that decisions that we make can stay with us for the rest of our lives and influence so many other decisions that we make, is well illustrated by Redford's character. Great interactions and witty banter among the lead actors. Enjoy!

6304711905|5.0|I have seen \\"Tombstone\\" more times than I can remember. And, on those lazy evenings, when they occur, if I flip through the channels and this movie is on, I stop and watch it. You can find many other detailed reviews here, so I will take the shorter path. For me, the cast is tremendous, and I agree with so many who found Kilmer to be superb here as Doc Holliday. The brand of self-deprecating humor that he displayed in this film is so dry and understated, it sneaks up on you and you find yourself repeating lines and then marveling at their nuance. There are a couple of slow periods, but, overall, this is a very well done, entertaining movie from start to conclusion. Forget the Costner pic. Just be cautious when you channel surf. This one may grab you every time.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Gerd Weisler (Ulrich Muhe, appropriately drab) is an East German Stasi (Secret Police) drone: the type of man that his superiors count on to \\"get\\" his prey. Early on in this fascinating, superior film, Gerd arrives home from a hard day of spying on his fellow East Germans and prepares a meal: microwaved white rice onto which he squeezes tomato paste from a tube. This scene, in its spare, workmanlike manner sets the course and adjusts the sights of this film: the unremarkable, out of hate and jealousy assigned to bring down those deemed different, those deemed remarkable, those deemed talented. Weisler is the perfect Stasi automaton: a socialist monk with ice-cold eyes and an incorruptible true believer's faith in the system he has sworn to defend against \\"enemies of socialism\\" no matter where he finds them.<br />\\"The Lives of Others\\" begins in 1984 a particularly Orwellian date and 5 years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Weisler is invited to a night of theater by his school friend and boss Colonel Grubitz (a slimy bureaucrat performance by Ulrich Tukor) for a performance of a play written by Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and starring Dreyman's live in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck from \\"Mostly Martha\\"). Dreyman is tall, handsome, dresses in colors other than grey and Christa-Maria is wondrously gorgeous and a great actress to boot.<br />As Weisler watches Christa-Maria on stage he also scopes in on Dreyman, via his opera binoculars, watching Christa-Maria with love and admiration. The look of distrust and envy in Wailer's eyes is frightening: his eyes widen, squint and widen again. What does Weisler see or sense on that triumphant, for Dreyman and Sieland, night? Is it watching them basking in the glory of an audience's love and appreciation? Is it the palpable love and warmth between the two themselves: something that Weisler has never, will never feel? Whatever it is, Weisler has found his next assignment.<br />Though Dreyman is deemed \\"the only writer we have who is not subversive,\\" Weisler forces the issue and sets up a full Stasi surveillance: bugs, cameras and sets up a roost for himself in the attic of the Dreyman-Sieland home.<br />Then in the process of spying on these two warm, happy, talented, loving people something happens to Weisler: he slowly, through the ugly process of spying, thaws little by little: Weisler falls in love with them and more to the point.., he falls in love with their lives.<br />First time director, Florien Hinkle von Donnersmarck has produced a remarkable, involving, intelligent film: an intricate, frightening film full of lives caught at the difficult crossroads of patriotism on the one hand and on the other the vortex of individual duty and honor.riter we have who is not subversive,\\" Weisler forces the issue and sets up a full Stasi surveillance: bugs, cameras and sets up a roost for himself in the attic of the Dreyman-Sieland home.

B00005N5RM|4.0|There is nothng more terrifying than watching the young and beautiful destroyed, while being robbed of their lives. Even the concept of what this creature is and the ideas it gives the imagination of what it must feel like to have such a hideous creature, like this, traveling through every orafice of your beautiful body, while it dissolves you as you scream in horrific pain, goes without saying. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has thought these thoughts watching this film. But this is what makes for good horror.<br /><br />Most scenes are a result of reverse filming, forward projection work and matt screening as well as latex modeling: Well done for the most part, but with some minor flaws in the effects and story line.<br /><br />Given the paranoia of the pestulance that hit the earth, starting 1981; first with AIDS, then ebola, and many other unheard of pathogens before that time, this film, I think, best expresses the darkness, fear and death scenario of the time as our world became overwhelmed with plagues.<br /><br />The death scenes in this are grizzly to say the least; with no respect given to life at all, thus adding to the suspense value. Except for some minor plot and effects flaws, I gave it four stars when it comes to addressing the subject of horror.<br /><br />It's been 20 years since this remake was made. I figure we are all due for a new remake from Hollywood, using today's computer graphics any time soon. Won't that be a treat?! I suggest no one under age 15 should watch this and those who have epilepsy should skip the theatre scene with the strobing effect used; so as to avoid possible seizure from happening.

Intrigued by the way it starts in the words and thoughts of a child and advances in the words of a very observant young person.

He really writes as though he were 7 years old.<br /><br />I walked, book in hand in the house as not to put it down !<br /><br />His Writing Changes as he grows up, and when he is a young adult, the Writing is that of An Adult.<br /><br />Aside from it being So Well Written, the story itself,his childhood is timeless and classic.<br /><br />Poverty is something everyone understands, or should.<br /><br /> Frank McCourt's mother Angela is not about pride, she retains  her dignity while doing anything she can to feed her children.

0618680004|4.0|I wish Richard Dawkins would stick to science. We need his intellect in such works of his as \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\" and \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\". One wonders whether he will actually ever write another science book, or has he now become an atheist missionary, preaching to the choir. Without better grounding in theology and philosophy, Dawkins' new role as high priest of atheism does not work well. He's made a pretty good start, but imagine the science he could do with the time he has spent bashing charlatans and various assorted ignorami and their doctrines. I'd rather see Richard Dawkins doing the science and letting Sam Harris write the essays. Somewhere in the middle of \\"The God Delusion\\" Dawkins says that he has now made his  main point and will move on to some side issues. It would seem that a better structure for this book would provide for a gradual accumulation of point and argument, for side issues to be dealt with along the way, and for the main point to be at the end of the book. But Dawkins has it otherwise. Neverthess, this is an excellent book, and well written. It remains to be seen how many theists will be deconverted because of it.

B000AYEL6U|4.0|Richard Armitage's Guy of Gisborne ([[ASIN:B001BSBC1Q Robin Hood: Seasons 1-2]]) really wowed me so I thought I should watch North & South, a BBC adaptation of the 1855 book by British author Elizabeth Gaskell ([[ASIN:B00141188M The Elizabeth Gaskell Collection (Wives and Daughters / Cranford / North and South)]]).  Northern-born Gaskell must have been wicked smart, as she worked for Charles Dickens and was the first to rework Pride & Prejudice! Gaskell cleverly reverses Darcy and Elizabeth's characters, Mrs. Thornton acts as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Thornton's sister Fanny substitutes for all the Bennett sisters, and the industrialized north is as desirable or even more so than Ms. Austen's beloved pastoral southern England.<br /><br />Her protagonist is Margaret Hale (Danilea  Denby-Ashe) an educated, refined, virtuous young woman from the \\"unmercantiled\\" South who is thrust into the ugliness and conflicts of Milton, an fictionalized industrialized Northern city (meant to be Manchester). Our heroine is transformed by her life in a Northern town, both as an individual and as a woman.  The backstory of the Industrial Age, English textile mills, speculative ventures, unions and labor/management relations illuminates that era very well.<br /><br />The four-disc series displays all the BBC hallmarks: uniformly good cast, thoughtful locations, authentic costumes and great set design. However, the cinematography has a more modern feel than many of the period dramas. The authentic mill interior with the white cotton floating through the air is stunning, especially with our dark haired hero striding through it like a Northern snow storm.<br /><br />Richard Armitage is mesmerizing as John Thornton, with his lethal combination of piercing blue eyes, soft voice and explosive temperament. RA can convey more in a glance than most actors can in a fifteen minute exposition and his subtle use of his hands and mouth subtly convey inner emotions in this break-out role. Supporting cast members Tim Pigott-Smith ([[ASIN:B000053VA4 The Jewel in the Crown]]) and Sinead Cusack ([[ASIN:B001EIOOWC Eastern Promises [Blu-ray]]]) are right up there with him every step of the way. The scenes between Armitage and Cusack are just amazing as they possess a familial resemble in coloring and the tenderness and pride between mother and son is palpable and deeply affecting.<br /><br />N&S relies on the same general plot as Pride & Prejudice so in the second half of story-Margaret spurns Thornton's marriage proposal but then is compelled by his moral character/actions to reconsider. Thornton always acts honorably but has a quick temper and an inferiority complex. When he is brought low by circumstances beyond his control, he reacts by becoming more humane and compassionate which works to his advantage on many levels. This is a keeper, just go ahead and buy it and place it on the shelf next to BBC Pride and Prejudice so you can watch it at any time.tt-Smith ([[ASIN:B000053VA4 The Jewel in the Crown]]) and Sinead Cusack ([[ASIN:B001EIOOWC Eastern Promises [Blu-ray]]]) are right up there with him every step of the way.

0316018953|3.0|Detective Harry Bosch has moved to the \\"Homicide Special\\" unit of the Los Angeles Police Department. Gone are his days, at least for now, of working old cases. Operating out of Parker Center, the unit deals with cases that have political, celebrity, or media connections or cases that look very tough from the start. Lt. Larry Gandle, his new boss, calls in the middle of the night regarding such a case. Dr. Stanley Kent has been found dead at the overlook above the Mulholland Dam. Matter of death was execution by impact of two bullets into the back of the head.<br /><br />Bosch and his new partner, Ignacio Ferras are assigned to the case. Not only are their cultural differences and a massive gap in ages, Ferras has a young family to support. New to working with each other, when the case quickly turns into fears of terrorism, Ferras doesn't trust that Bosch is handling things correctly. Dr. Kent was a medical physicist who worked with and had access to radioactive materials that are usually used to treat cancer patients. Since such materials could be used for other things, his name among many others from across the country was on a list maintained by the FBI. Reports of his death and the circumstances surrounding it have reached the FBI. As the federal government ramps up operations, Special Agent Rachel Walling from the Tactical Intelligence Unit returns to assist.<br /><br />As has been made clear many times in this series, when the FBI arrives to assist, they usually mean to take over. Such events happen here and Bosch has to deal not only with conflict with his own command structure and the FBI, but with his partner as well who doesn't approve of Bosch's methods. Ferras has a lot to think about with his family and his career and Bosch's bulldozer style is not appreciated.<br /><br />Originally serialized for the \\"New York Times Magazine\\" and then expanded for this 225 page novel, this isn't Bosch at his best. I never read the serialization which, according to the note about the author at the end of the book, was \\"considerably expanded\\" for this novel. Therefore, I can't address what changes were made.<br /><br />With regards to the actual novel, there is a certain flatness to the read. A certain lack of humanity, of human feeling in Bosch though he tells readers he is feeling things. That lack of human feeling extends to the discussions of the recent shared past between Walling and Bosch and where they left things, Bosch's relationship with Ferras, Bosch's new job and in many other areas. While readers are constantly told that Bosch is feeling this or that, it is never shown through character action or showed any other way, resulting in an emotionally distant read.<br /><br />At the same time, the case itself is a decent one that will keep a fair amount of readers guessing to the end. Those with a cynical bent or widely read in the mystery genre will pick up on clues hinted at early in the novel which will be borne out on the end with one final twist in regards to a suspect. While a less than stellar read, Bosch not at his best is still entertaining and readers familiar with the series won't want to let this one get by unread.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000PKG6TE|4.0|This album isn't as instantly likeable as previous outings by QOTSA - even though some tracks grab you from the first play. It is only after repeated listening that some of the subtleties begin to reveal themselves and the real craft that's been put in comes to the fore.  If there's one word I'd use to describe the appeal of this band it's \\"energy\\". Even with a new band line up this is tight, heavy and above all energetic. It gets into your head and makes you move. The tone isn't exactly dark but it is brooding, atmospheric and has that hint of danger that gives the music a real edge. The singles are good and give you a flavour for the album but it's only when you hear this album as a whole and enjoy tracks like \\"River in the Road\\" and \\"Misfit Love\\" that you'll see what's going on.   I'd highly recommend it.

0385340559|4.0|I love a fast paced novel that keeps you turning the pages and tuning out everything else going on around you. This book and most of the Reacher books are fast paced and exciting.  I think this is a great series.  I've read almost all of the Jack Reacher books.<br /><br />Having said that I felt a bit confused about the new savant-like mathematical skills.  Seems unrealistic that after 10 books in which nothing along these lines has been mentioned, Reacher suddennly has this amazing talent with mathematics.  Reacher meets Daniel Tammet?  I don't know perhaps I'm being too picky here.  It just bugged me.  If it was the only Reacher book I had ever read I wouldn't have given it another thought, but I felt like I knew Jack Reacher.<br /><br />G R E A T  B O O K  - definitely worth reading.
B000Q66QAG|4.0|The 'old-fashioned' disaster movie scenario enjoyed a brief resurgence in the latter half of the 90s. After the success of Twister and ID4, films like Hard Rain, Titanic, Armageddon and Deep Impact followed in its wake. Like the two competing asteroid movies, Dante's Peak was in competition with the imaginatively named Volcano as THE Lava flow of 1997. Which one is better? Well, comparing the two is like comparing an atomic blast to a popping pimple.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan is Harry Dalton, a Vulcanologist (or James Bond in disguise if you want) who predicts a major eruption in the quaint Pacific-Northwestern town of Dante's Peak. No one wants to listen to him since the town has just been named the 2nd most desirable place to live in America and is in the early stages of a thriving economy. It's the politics from Jaws all over again. Despite being shouted down by his superiors, Harry sticks around to keep his eye on the imposing mountain and woo Mayor Wando (Linda Hamilton), who is the only one who believes the 4000-year dormant volcano might blow its top.<br /><br />If you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen 'em all in terms of character importance. Yes, it's bloody obvious who is going to die, some of these people might as well have a death clock counting down stuck on their foreheads. And the panicking idiot mobs don't deserve anything less firey. When will nameless extras learn that following the crowd isn't the best way? I guess this is the weakest part of Dante's Peak, it never really distances itself from that single, eternal clich&eacute; of disaster films.<br /><br />But the film is really nothing but a showcase for special effects and it does them surprisingly well. Made before the extreme popularity of CGI, Dante's Peak has a lot of real-life destruction, in-camera effects and stunt-work. Yes, there is a fair bit of CGI and for a 10-year-old film they still hold up really well. All Volano (Zzzz...) had to offer was a very, very slight lava flow and an unintentionally hilarious scene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes, boiled skinny dippers, lakes of acid, ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere, thunder and lightning, red hot boulders raining down from the sky, mudslides, lava (of course), a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep, deep bass sound effects.<br /><br />It's not a life-changing film by any means, but as disaster movies go it's one of the best, has an occasionally spooky score and entertains really well despite Brosnan taking it all so seriously. I would have given it a higher rating if they killed the dog (more original) and deleted the annoying Grant Heslov's utterly pointless character.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film is gorgeous 1080p 2.35:1 with a brilliant DTS HD-MA sound design. The best of the extras from the SD-DVD are ported over, but why the horrible new cover?cene with a melting man but with Dante's Peak we get earthquakes, boiled skinny dippers, lakes of acid, ash blizzards that create a unique atmosphere, thunder and lightning, red hot boulders raining down from the sky, mudslides, lava (of course), a massive pyroclastic cloud and lots of deep, deep bass sound effects.

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Good music, great talent.  Norah Jones, James Taylor, B.B. King! with past and current stars this CD is totally enjoyable.  Willie Nelson's set is my favorite and I can't forget to mention Diana Krall.

B000RZIGVS|5.0|I haven't seen the actual DVDs for this complete series set, so bear in mind that this is a review for the series itself, NOT the particular product.    I distinctly recall being taken to see \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" by my father when the movie was released in 1986, and at some point during the ride home, while we were talking about how much we had liked it, my dad mentioned that a new television series was being made.  He was quick to point out that it wouldn't feature Kirk and Spock and crew, though: it was set further into the future, and would be about a later crew on the Enterprise.  My reply was something like this: \\"What?!?  Why would anyone watch THAT?!?\\"    And yet, a bit less than a year later, when \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" ushered in a new era of Trek, there we both were, glued to our little television set, watching intently.  We both agreed that Data was cool, and that Work was cool, and that Picard was cool.  I thought the whole idea of Q was mind-blowing, and was a fan of the series from that point forward.    Looking back on it today, there is a certain amount of late-'80s cheesiness at the show's beginning -- the costumes and sets seem rather budget-conscious, the sterility of the environment is a bit hokey, and some of the acting and writing is occasionally definicient (even Patrick Stewart seems a bit stilted here and there) -- but what's easy to take for granted now, twenty years later, is how very well the concept itself worked.  By all rights, that 12-year-old version of me who wondered who would want to watch a Kirkless Enterprise ought to have been correct in his disbelief.  And yet, the series was immediately able to make itself distinct from the previous series and movies, and to sell the concept of the Enterprise having become a weird sort of spacebound hybrid United Nations/daycare/hotel/exploration vessel.  By all rights, it should not have worked.  But it did, and quickly (if not completely at first).    The first season was (and is) much maligned by critics and fans, but looking back on it now still turns up a number of hlighlight episodes: \\"Where No One Has Gone Before,\\" \\"The Big Goodbye,\\" \\"11001001,\\" and \\"Conspiracy\\" are among the best.  But there are also good character-driven episodes in which we get to know Data, and Worf, and Riker, and the Ferengi are (nicely) introduced in a decidedly more villainous guise than they would eventually have in Trek mythos.    For my money, season two was the season that wasn't very good.  Doctor Crusher disappears, and is replaced (just for one season, luckily) by Doctor Pulaski, who I never liked very much.  Worse than that, the writing was pretty poor, with a number of the series' worst episodes turning up: \\"The Royale,\\" \\"Shades of Grey,\\" and \\"The Outrageous Okona\\" are pretty lousy.  And yet, things definitely began to perk up toward the end of the season, and once Q returned, threw the Enterprise clear across the galaxy, and introduced the Borg as a major new villain, the series had really started to find its feet.    Season three, by all accounts, was the point at which the show truly came into its own.  Sure enough, the episodes are generally of a high calibre, with \\"Yesterday's Enterprise,\\" \\"The Offspring,\\" \\"Sins of the Father,\\" \\"Captain's Holiday,\\" and \\"Sarek\\" (amongst others) proving to be Trek classics.  But it was the season finale, in which the Borg returned to pay off season two's \\"Deja Q,\\" that really sparked a fire.  The cliffhanger of that episode (if you don't already know, I don't want to ruin it) is one that people STILL list as being one of the best in TV history.    The resolution, in season four, seems comparatively like a bit of a letdown, but really, what could possibly have lived up to part one?  All in all, season four is even better than season three, with the characters continuing to get richer and more complex.  The second episode, \\"Family,\\" is one of my personal favorites, but there are many great episodes: \\"Reunion,\\" \\"Data's Day,\\" \\"Galaxy's Child,\\" \\"Q-pid,\\" and \\"The Drumhead.\\"  Worf gets a decent amount of attention this season, and the (now standard) season-ending cliffhanger is all about the Klingons.    Season five brings \\"Darmok,\\" which is very much in the vein of Classic Trek -- it makes a terrific companion piece with \\"Arena,\\" for example.  A new crewmember, Ensign Ro, is introduced, and though she never quite managed to join up full-time, she's a welcome addition in the episodes she IS in.  The series' best episode (possibly the best episode of any Trek series), \\"The Inner Light,\\" was this season -- it's a true gem.  However, the season also saw a few missteps.  The two-parter \\"Unification,\\" which brought Spock into the Next Generation universe, is mostly a bore that does nothing to live up to its potential, and mostly comes off seeming like a stunt gone wrong.  Also, I've always hated \\"I, Borg\\" and its attempts to humanize the Borg.  It makes sense and is a good reflection of the themes of this series, but sometimes villains ought to just stay villains.    During season six, there was more stunt casting, with James Doohan coming on board to play a long-lost Scotty in \\"Relics.\\"  Happily, this is a big improvement over \\"Unification,\\" and ends up being a true delight.  For the most part, though, I found season six to be one of the weaker seasons.  There aren't any particularly bad episodes, there just aren't many that are particularly great, either.  Mostly, it feels like what it was: a well-seasoned series that was beginning to coast a bit.  Still, this is better than what you get from most series.    Season seven continued this trend, with virtually no standout episodes . . . until the season finale, \\"All Good Things,\\" which manages to not only be a great episode in and of itself, but also to wrap the entire series up in a nice little bow.  Very few series are allowed the opportunity to end gracefully, and many of them manage to drop the ball when they get the chance, but I don't think anyone can gripe about how \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" ended.    All in all, what you are getting when you buy these DVDs is a remarkably solid series.  Every season contained at least one classic episode, and there are really only a small handful of duds.  The characters are terrific, and helped to redefine the very notion of what we come to expect from characters on sci-fi television.  I really don't think that \\"Babylon 5,\\" \\"Farscape,\\" \\"Firefly,\\" or the new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" could have achieved the tremendous heights that they each achieved if this show had never existed.  If it seems a little dated now, then just try and pretend you're back in 1987; all of a sudden, it'll seem fresh and new, which is exactly what it was.    I can only hope and suume that Paramount will be bringing ober the extras from the original DVD releases -- each season had about an hour's worth of fine documentaries.  It'd be nice to also see some commentaries, and I'd plan on seeing some kind of nifty packaging.    But if you're getting nothing but the episodes, you're still getting something pretty special.

B00006JSS8|4.0|some of the songs I had not heard. But my favorite song was on this cd so I purchased it.
1592402038|5.0|This book is not for everyone, but if you're a stickler for using the right words with the right punctuation, then this is for you! I loved it!
B000Q6GUWU|4.0|This movie was definatly different. My wife and I both really liked it. The story was pretty good. There could have been a little more to the end though. I recomend eighteen and over watch it.
B000OCZD60|4.0|I won't go into the movie itself, since everyone has seen it by now and knows it is a classic.  This HD disc is great though, for a movie of this budget and age.  There are a few short segments that look soft, but overall this disc has spectacular razor sharp HD, and I never thought Mad Max 2 could ever look this great.  Seriously, some of these scenes are some of the best I've seen from my HD-A2.     Now for the not-so-good.  Sound is adequate, but it won't knock anyone's socks off.  The disc is absolutely bare bones.  But if you gotta have this movie in HD, I doubt you would be disappointed.
1594489505|5.0|This story of two women's lives in Modern day Afghanistan is very interesting and easy to read.  I didn't want to put it down.  If you were a fan of Kite Runner, you will definitely like this one.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|By far the best and most breath-taking documentary out there.  I guarantee that you will be dumbstruck at least once an episode.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Not being able to see it in the movies, still it was far the best movie Cage has done.  Loved the action and comments.  Getting the extended cut version was the way to go.  Hearing the comments about the comic was very interesting and I had no idea that there  was an  old comic based on the movie.  Very cool indeed.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|a powerful, sonic stimulant that breathes fresh life into the current rock world. At their best, they capture the excitement of a band like Depeche Mode, delivering rhythmic surprises at every turn while being accessible and addictive. Muse demonstrates a deft combination of guitars with synths and manages to fill the gap left between the purists on either side. They are melodic and soothing while rocking.<br /><br />The Killers are coming to town (for which I already have tickets) but Muse is showing up a few days later...think I'm gonna have to try to swing this one, as well.
B000O178BY|3.0|My very short list of bands that I will buy from without hearing it first has just gotten smaller.    This is coming from a long time fan that bought Pretty Hate Machine in 1990.I never thought I would ever have a need for the skip button when listening to NiN, the last two records proved me wrong. I bought this CD on the day it was released and listened to it for a week straight, and have come back to it in hopes that I just missed something. Sadly, my first impressions were accurate.    With the exception of 'Right Where It Belongs', With Teeth was a terrible mess.    This one is better, but not really that much of an improvement.    This is not a brave album or unique. If he did it 4-5 years ago, it could be considered brave. Anyone who didn't fall for the fear mongering of Bush & co, could see it then. Now, all but the backwash vote can see it. So this is just bandwagon jumping. If he could have come up with a unique angle, it might have been better. It is the underlying ideas of V for Vendetta put to generally poorly crafted music.    Trent has mentioned several times over the past few years that he is out of ideas. It seems he still is and is out of gas. This is just NiN phoned in. There is nothing new here at all.    The music is noisy and often without structure. It is a sloppy mess, not a skilled mess like he is capable of. There was no effort put into this.    1. Hyperpower! 6/10 he's done better but it isn't bad.    2. The Beginning Of The End 7/10 One of the better on this disk, one of the few where the random noise works because it is over some structure.    3. Survivalism 6/10 Fairly decent    4. The Good Soldier 7/10 Good song. At this point I thought Trent has finally got his act together. So the next few were major disappointments.    5. Vessel 2/10 This sucks.    6. Me, I'm Not 4/10 Should have been much better    7. Capital G 0/10 I am not sure if Trent was trying to get us to forget AWITHA TEETHA or what he was going for in his vocalizations. Ifannoying was his goal he succeeded. Trent is not that great of a singer, so why does he purposefully bring himself down?    8. My Violent Heart 3/10 Is there a reason he spent time creating this?    9. The Warning 1/10 Pointless. At this point I was so disappointed, just a sad state of affairs.    10. God Given 8/10 Finally a good song. After the suck trifecta this is much needed. Solid song from beginning to end, but after many years of poor performance I have to wonder if it is good by accident.    11. Meet Your Master 3/10 Utterly forgettable     12. The Greater Good 0/10 Recording his squeaky windshield wipers and putting it to bad music and inane lyrics. Brilliant! Or something.    13. The Great Destroyer (8/10+0/10)=4/10 The first 1:58 or so is very good. At least on par with God Given, no classic, but Trent is past writing classics. The rest of it is pure garbage.    14. Another Version Of The Truth 3/10 YAAAAAWN    15. In This Twilight 6/10 Mildly interesting    16. Zero-Sum 8/10 Enjoyable song, it is not a classic, but good enough for this record.    So that is a 4.25 average or ~2.13/5, but it is better then With Teeth and while it is not good, it flows fairly well, so I bumped it up to 3/5.
1594489505|5.0|This noval opened my eyes to a culture that had been just a draped sterotype  previously. The individuality, strength, and intelligence, of the female characters in this novel are unforgettable. Their fates during times of war  were tragic but courageous and honorable.
B000NHG7BQ|4.0|I saw Revenge at the theater with a friend of mine. We weren't quite sure what to expect. We were both pleasantly surprised.    Revenge is a tale about loyalty, friendship, love, passion and forgiveness. This is defintely NOT your run-of-the mill action film. In fact, the film has very little action, but when it does, the action serves the story, not vice-versa. Costner, Stowe and Quinn all give outstanding performances.    The main thing that stuck with me through this film is the HUMANITY of the characters and the story. The plot was very down to earth and the overall tone was pretty dark and depressing. Not to give anything away, but the ending is not all what one would expect from this genre of film.    If you're looking for something different, give Revenge a try. If you're looking for a feel-good movie with a typical Hollywood happy ending, you may want to look elsewhere.    I am glad to be able to own this film.
075640407X|5.0|Rothfuss is beyond a doubt a very talented writer.  His characterization was superb.  The plot and story line beautifully done.  There is much mystery and intrigue throughout the whole story. I have only one complaint and if I could I would have given this 4 1/2 stars because of it.  First off, the story begins wonderfully with lots of action and even a strange deadly creature, and then the action just stops.  For the next 500 pages, the reader learns about the character of Kvothe and the people and situations that have made an impact on his life.  This is not so bad.  As a matter of fact, Rothfuss is such a wonderful writer, it is no heartache in the least, but with a slow story like this, it made it hard for me to keep reading for any length of time.  I ended up stopping every 150-200 pages and reading another book, then going back to this one.  Don't think I'm trying to stop you from reading this book, trust me, it was not anything so bad that it prevented the reader from enjoying the book.  Learning about Kvothe's parents, teachers, enemies, was also very worthwhile.  I'm looking forward to the next, which I hear will not be a very long wait.
B0001HLVS2|4.0|What really struck me about this film was that it felt almost exactly like a submarine movie despite being set on a Tall Ship during the Napoleonic Wars--I could practically see Aubrey in the attack center of the USS Seawolf ordering the ship to rig for ultraquiet when they slipped into the fog to evade the Acheron at the beginning.  It wasn't completely like [[ASIN:B000AYEIW2 Horatio Hornblower Collector's Edition]], especially with the chief medical officer being a civilian for some reason and Aubrey being a little more parental than the tough-but-fair Sir Edward Pellew I'd become used to, but it was enjoyable and I'm wondering when they'll be doing any more from the series.
B000092Q7O|5.0|this movie was a very touching to watch . it was one of the best i have seen in a while, the 10 year old nephew had many questions about the events,  he showed so much interest in this story and he learned things from it.i was pleased to watch it with a kid who showed so much interest.   guess what he made his parents rent it so he could see it again. and we also have watched it again   loved this movie

0143038419|5.0|I thouroughly enjoyed Liz Gilbert's account of her travels and her self exploration thru these three very different countries. Every page held humor and wit as she described her journey over the 12 months. I really enjoyed her writing style and the storytelling way she winds thru the book. Excellent read!!!
0099478935|3.0|I agree with some of the negative comments about this book. It's an important book, but a good editor should have pared away a fair amount of the \\"today I had a meeting with...\\" and other items from his daily journal. The book would have been stronger by eliminating all too many of his detailed daily journal items. He could have gotten the message across better without burying us in all the acronyms, as someone mentioned. If someone gave a speech to the general public, and used all of those acronyms, a fair number of listeners would tune out. Sorry, but it's true. Very glad that I read the book, though!
B00005JPQT|5.0|Bruce Willis is my hero!!  He survives the most implausible and impossible situations and comes back to defend America and kill the bad guys.  He is a GOD!!  There are enough car crashes, car chases, explosions, bombs, bad guys, bullets, and dead bodies to satisfy the demands of at least a half dozen action movies.  I LOVED IT.  This movie shows John Maclane hasn't lost any of his moxie as he thwarts the bad guys who have launched a cyber attack on the US.  However, in a salute to political correctness the producers elected to make the bad guys disgruntled Americans intent on stealing money rather than the more plausible Muslims, who have actually sworn to destroy America.  But then by making the bad guys Americans the producers do get to show the world what a bunch of dumbbells the US government employs.  Still this is a small virturally irrelevant criticism because this movie is great.  It is guaranteed to get your adrenalin flowing and your testosterone to reach new highs.  John MacClane is a real super hero and a combination of John Wayne and Dirty Harry all roled into one.  Willis gets off some good wise cracks and his little nerdy friend also provides some good commentary.  This is a great film and I highly recommend it.  I wouldn't recommend it as a date film, but for guys it is a five star film.
0738702994|5.0|I haven't dived into the companion book yet to read about the different characters, but I just love looking at the deck..  The art is just beautiful.

B0002F6AZC|4.0|OK first off, I'm a huge EC Comics fan, and Creepshow was a great tribute to those old comics. I love the first film, The cRate being my all time favorite story on Creepshow, when I was 9 it scared the crap out of me. I cherish that film, Creepshow 2 to most people is greatly inferior, and well it is inferior but not hardly. The 2nd Creepshow suffered from a low budget and the fact it was cut from 5 stories to just 3. Thanks you studios. The dirsctor did a good job though considering. The 1st story is weak and not as good as it could be, But The Raft is a great show on par with The Crate, This is actually a improvement on Stephen Kings story with a way better ending.  The 3rd story is pretty good and in the most EC style. PLus you have Tom Savini as The Creeper, this is a good film in style while it would have benefited from a better budget and two more stories. Its not the best but it there is some fun to be had.  Just don't buy the horrible Creepshow 3 as it has nothing to do with these films only in name.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Probably not the most magnificent Brad's album, but it's only a pleasure to hear he play and sing.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I thought the 7th season was over all very good, though it was a bit lacking in the witty banter that first drew me to the show. I heard that this wasn't a planned last season, if so I understand that some things were left in an odd place. It was still great any way. It would be hard to pick favorites but the one were Emily goes to jail and has to call Loreli to come and get her was so funny, Or when Loreli's car breaks down and employs Luke to help her find a new one, but Luke soon gets upset with her because none of the cars are giving her \\"that\\" feeling. The last one was so sad and wonderful at the same time. It was a good place to leave it. A few things I felt unresolved but not nagging. It was great.
B0000026KQ|3.0|Jeff Beck is definately one of the greatest guitar gods ever, and he definately proves this here his riffs are hard hitting and his solos are fast and brilliant.  However, one thing this album does not succeed in is giving a musical experience.  Most of the songs are hard rocking but steady giving a heavy load kind of feel and the softer songs are less spectacular because of the mechanical keyboad \\"orchestras\\" backing jeff up.    Amazing playing, but if you want a musical experience check out Blow by Blow or Wired
B000DWMN2S|4.0|Everything is Illuminated is an art film, but it is not one in the typical way. It has a story, it has humor, and it has heart, but it never becomes pretentious. The film follows Jonathan (Elijah Wood), a \\"collector\\" of memories. He is attempting to retrace his grandfather's life and learn about the woman that saved him from WWII. He journeys to the Ukrane where his tour guides consist of a hip-hop obsessed translator Alex (Eugene Hutz) and his eccentric grandfather (Boris Leskin). They rib him for being afraid of their dog, Sammy Davis Jr. Jr., and for being a vegetarian. They want to know why he wants to learn about his grandfather. Along the way, however, his strangeness becomes comfortable and everyone realizes they have much more in common than initially realized.<br /><br />The comedy is intellectual, just like in Little Miss Sunshine. It isn't blatantly, but gentle and easy to miss. The story can be a bit confusing and aimless, but that gives the viewer room to make his own conclusions. Films like this are often overlooked, just as this one was never very famous. That does not detract from it's quality. It is an enjoyable, thought-provoking film with a great cast.

B00005JPLW|5.0|I loved the movie 300.  Even more than I loved the graphic novel on which it's based.  And that's the fact that I think most people are overlooking when they talk about how 300 the movie is commenting on our current political situation.  It's based on a graphic novel that was published in 1999.  That's before 9/11, before the Iraq war, before the war on terrorism, before Bush was elected, before Islamo-fascism was is most Americans' vocabularies.  It was written as a cool, bloody story about how 300 Spartans kicked butt, and just because it parallels current events doesn't mean it's in response to them.  Now I know what you're thinking.  Did Zack Snyder make the movie now because of this parallel?  I don't know.  What I do know is that the movie follows the graphic novel pretty much word for word (except for the business with the queen), including most if not all of those lines about the need to fight for freedom which are being called pro-Bush propaganda.  And I also know that it's a kick-butt adaptation of a kick-butt graphic novel and a truly breathtaking work of art, not to mention one of the best times I've had at the theatre this year.  And to lose sight of that in some discussion of political slant is to fail to appreciate a movie by taking it too seriously.  PS- Plus, if this movie were really about the Iraq war, Leonidas wouldn't have led his men into battle; he would've been safely bunkered in an undisclosed location during the fighting.
1559409002|4.0|Everything about this film suggests \\"el-cheapo drive-in flick\\": pretty woman, cheap thrills, low-budget, cheesy effects.  But somehow it adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  The directorial touches are actually well-conceived and artistic.  The acting is above-average.  And, the soundtrack score is fantastic.  It and the Salt Lake pavilion provide a wonderfully eerie and dreamlike backdrop that keeps the viewer entranced.    The Criterion package is, as usual, a bang-up job.  There are several entertaining extras.  My favorite is a news/documentary piece on the Salt Lake pavilion.  It provides a history of a very interesting piece of Mormon/Utah history.

B000FSME1A|4.0|Here's the thing - Hearts of Darkness: a Filmmaker's Apocalypse is brilliant. It stands alone as being the MOTHER OF ALL \\"MAKING OF\\" DOCUMENTARIES and guess what? Its not on DVD...thanks to Coppola. Personally, if you haven't seen it, by all means its worth the hunt. Ebay or Amazon has used copies on VHS running for $30. To me it was the best 30 bucks I spent on a crappy VHS ever. Hearts gives Apocalypse Now more crediblity than it already has. Watching the production slumber into 200 or so days of principal photography gives you more appreciation for what Francis Ford Coppola had to go through. Also your probably going to want to buy this edition too since well, after Hearts of Darkness, your going to want to watch the movie again.     I love the idea of a two-disc edition to Apocalypse Now. I personally would double dip ,but one factor prevents me from purchase...NO Hearts. I just think its sad that Hearts of Darkness: A filmmaker's Apocalypse has become a tough film to get a hold of and people like me are not able to find a higher quality version.     There is nothing better than watching back to back Hearts of Darkness/Apocalypse Now double feature.
B00000JGHS|3.0|I just watched Striptease last night.   Demi looked amazing!  I don't care how she got that way but her body was incredible.   The dance sequences were great and using the Eurythmics/Annie Lennox songs was a perfect choice.   As for the movie itself it was just an excuse to showcase Demi - the plot, characters, everything was just muddled and confused.  Ving Rhames' character was pretty cool though - very Marcellus Wallace-lite.   All in all this movie is okay if you watch it while having a few margaritas!
1582701709|3.0|I had this referred to me by the daughter of one of my best friends. She was virtually blown away with it,suggesting it was the greatest thing she had ever read; and that it gave the SECRET to life which had been known for centuries but never revealed to the masses.<br /> I watched the DVD, as opposed to the book.There is no doubt that the pictures and sound certainly adds to getting the message across.However,if you've been around long enough to have heard the motivational messages of many others ,such as \\"The Power Of  Positive Thinking\\",by Norman Vincent Peale ,many years ago,or any of the many books,Videos,and presentations of Anthony Robbins over the last 20 years;you will conclude that the messages are all the same.There is no unrevealed Secret,nor has there ever been,unless you think there is something secret about positive motivation.If there is any shortcoming to this book ,it is that it tends to lean too far to the concept that one can have anything they desire simply by wishing for it. A much greater emphasis on \\"Backbone \\" and less on \\"Wishbone\\" is advice that has been handed down through the ages and would surely be endorsed by anyone who has been moderately or highly successful.<br />  Motivation,in whatever form it comes,is the root of all success,but it is nothing but a \\"feel good tonic\\" unless it has actions to go with it.When you look at the super or even moderately successful people ,you will see that it was never the money or the things that money can bring,that inspired their success.It was a dream to do something,help someone,fill a need ,or something like that which drove them;the money and what it brought to them was a by-product;and just as often brought grief as happiness.<br /> There are many different similar approaches taken in this field. This one comes from the academic field of Business Administration and like Anthony Robbins,those who promise untold riches from sales such as Real Estate,and others, place heavy emphasion riches and material things. Then there are those which place emphasises on personal well being,happiness,serving their fellow man etc.This and other books try to cover both.<br /> The academic world has been active in the last number of decades,particularly in the area of Business Administration,and in the \\"industry\\" of motivation and a huge amount of money has been made there. But when you look around at success,you will see it was a personal dream ,a lot of hard work,yes ,and sometimes luck and timing that brought success.Many have said that the harder they worked,the more luck they had and the more successful they became.<br />  Ask yourself if Ford,Gates,Churchill,Mother Teresa,Bing Crosby,Babe Ruth,Elvis,Iacocca,Rev.Martin Luthur King,Abe Lincoln,or anyone else you consider successful;what was their reason for success;they would hardly suggest it was a secret they gleamed from a book or presentation.Yes ,these can provide motivation ,but that is a very minor thing,and they already had that.<br />  In other words,there's no magic bullet,or secret.But yes,Virginia,there is still a Santa Claus.terial things.

074356619X|4.0|It's a compilation of all the positive thinking authors concept. It's well put together though.    The only change I suggest I is to have someone else narrate as Rhonda Byrne's accent sounds a little bit pretentious for the normal ear.    I just listened to the Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz.  The narrator is Peter Coyote whose narration and voice is more soothing and smooth. Very relaxing to listen to.
B000KQGX1Y|4.0|This is a very good cd and very enjoyable.  If you like this type of music it is a must have.
B00062RCBW|5.0|This was a perfect buy! It was/is everything I wanted. I don't think I could have found a better price and it was delievered in a decent about of time.  (Of course if you're not a trekkie,you may not like this item).:)
1401207529|3.0|I bought this TPB after having read \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" and I think most Batman comics would pale in comparison to the depth and sheer coolness of that story. Having said that, \\"Year One\\" is a good read but I was expecting... more. More exposition on Batman's origins. The new film Batman Begins (which obviously draws on this book for inspiration) showed a more complex and \\"real\\" version of the Batman myth. I was hoping for something along those lines but it's more like getting a third of that story in comic book form. Very good... but not great.
B000069KE0|5.0|This was my very first album, bought it when I was 11....This is a must have for any real collection!!!  After the seventh album, in my opinon, the music starts to really get lax.  It seems to me after Terry died, the band lost its power and seemed to become just another top 40 radio play.  I was lucky enough to see the original line-up play at the Nassau County Colesium on Long Island back in '78....What a show.  Don't hesitate to get this one.  The mixing of music styles is truly unique.  It is up there with such great albums as Tommy, Quadraphina, Dark Side of the Moon, and the White Album.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I had not hear any of the songs from the album before I bought it.  But being a long time Bon Jovi fan, I figured I couldn't go wrong.  I was right.  Just 30 seconds into the title track and I could tell this was a winner.  After listening to it a few times I start to hear some of the country influence, but trust me, it rocks in typical Bon Jovi fashion.  Every track is fantastic!  If you're a Bon Jovi fan, buy this album.  You won't be disappointed.  They definitely have \\"Got it going on!\\"      Nice job Jon and company.  Keep 'em coming!
0765316978|5.0|This book has more the feel of the first book than the second. Very strong conclusion to the trilogy with a great ending that came as a surprise to me. I'm torn between wanting Scalzi to revisit the great characters he developed for the series in yet another sequel, or the desire to have him leave this finely crafted trilogy alone.
0743289412|4.0|I took until about page 150 to decide to continue and am really glad I did. I finished the book wishing it wasn't over. I know it was a tough road in the beginning but I am ever so glad I was able to finish, I must say I almost loved it, certainly more than like it.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Music is a kind of magic ... magic that forms in the hearts of musicians and filters out to us through their hands and mouths, and through the hands and mouths of their friends and family. The minutes that inclose \\"The Concert for George\\" compose one of those moments where magic wells from the stage, from the sight of Dhani Harrison (George's son, who so strikingly looks like George in his youth it's spooky), to Ravi Shankar and his daughter Anoushka, to Eric Clapton doing \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\",to Jeff Lynne on \\"Give Me Love\\", to Joe Brown (to whom the Beatles were second-billed way back when) plucking \\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\" on the ukelele (and so much more). Throw in the pixie dust of Monty Python (joined by Tom Hanks in uniform) doing \\"The Lumberjack Song\\" and \\"Sit on My Face\\", and you have something incredible coming through your DVD player. Just buy it ... you'll watch the magic more than once, and you'll thank the friends and family of George Harrison for passing it on to you every time.
B000P2A24W|5.0|I think the album is great!!  Probably the best yet for Bon Jovi!  Highly recommend!!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|James Iha and Darcy were never songwriters or even performed on the recordings of all the early Pumpkin albums. They were more like hired live musicians. Billy always played all guitars and bass on the albums and Jimmy the drums. So the Smashing Pumpkins are Billy and Jimmy---  This is a solid album. Reminds me of a more poppy Gish--
0062502182|4.0|Apologize for writing the review without reading a novel - but went through the other reviews and thought I can write a comment - so this is strictly not a review.    I believe I have tried what this book is trying to tell. I got back to my home country with lot of questions in my mind like is my life as simple as the dream American life of \\"greencard-house-two cars-two\\" kids? Am I just running in circles of capitalism without REALLY doing anything? What about all the good fellas I knew of in my childhood, in my country - how did they reach where they were - those freedom fighters - those great writers and poets - not in a capitalist way - I had at the back of my mind. That way, my country (what eventually is \\"My Country\\"?) and USA share one similar history, that they both fought against common enemy - British. But in India they were replaced by wealthy \\"Have's\\" category folks. And they did worst to \\"Have not's\\" in comparison to British - so I think sometimes. May be same in US - I haven't seen the other side of US, but seems much fairer at least prima facie - at my reach level of middle class life. Of course we always thank Mr Columbus for not reaching India - else we would be Red Indians!! Questions and questions - and that is where my journey began - about four years back. All I wanted was life where simple things like a chalk and a board would be sufficient and necessary to do what you want to do in life. I walked on this journey without getting involved into it - like a true observer (!?) of quantumn mechanics or separating Yin Vs Yang.[Have you seen Escher's drawing hands!] Or sometimes acting like a water - which takes the color of what u mix it with. May be my initial question was that why can't my country achieve what US is today? I was targeting the knowledge way - knowledge has this property that it is ISOROPIC. But realized that it is treated in anisotropic way in reality! Does progressing like US mean everyone should have a car?! Ah haa ... there beginsthe capitalism and so called spiritualism - underline - so called. Saw a lot of vicious capitalism in India too. A common man eventually has to choose a better worst. Friends is US say they have freedom to choose what they want and like - and I wonder about the phone service company you can choose from :)     Later discovered that the problem that I am seeing at country level exists right around me - may be in a prototypical way - at our housing society. Luckily (or by fate?) bumped onto a position where i could at least make some effect. And the realization is probably similar to what this book is trying to tell.    All n all - I have seen that the western thought (Iyn Rand, Russell and now flat world of Friedmann type folks, i would rate Feynman/Hoftstadter way higher) stops at much earlier level than Indian or eastern stuff - just my perception without any comparison attempt - these folks are great  of course. [question being - did easterners go beyond materialistic life OR they simply did not get it? Is it completeness or rationalization?] The western thought somehow struggles to reach out of capitalism while conveying the thought to those in capitalism. Of course some make huge fortune out of it. But Apple's Steve Job's run away from India is an eye opener too - for so called philosophers and their philosophies in India like country. They want foreign preys whereby they make their living.    Well, the point I am trying to make is - such books basically tell - what we call as Grandma's stories in the childhood. There are some very interesting stories from ancient times which try to teach mankind. For example there is a story of \\"Dagadfodya\\" i.e. a stonebroker - a daily wage laborer - whose son wants a powerful friend to play with. So he goes to mountain, who directs him to cloud who directs him to wind who directs him to Sun and the chain goes on. The chain ends with his present friend who can break stones with his hammer - who turns out to be the most powerful! I thinks this book is similar to this story.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|This will put you to sleep, despite good actors and an interesting story. Too long. Is he a good guy?
B000053VAZ|5.0|One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies. Happy to add it to my growing collection of his movies. If you have not seen it, you should. Very uplifting story and very entertaining. Johnny Depp does Charlie Chaplin/Buster Keaton better than anyone! Aiden Quinn and Mary Stuart Masterson at their best also! Enjoyed the bonus tracks as well. Worth your time and worth your money.
8420483885|5.0|Much better than the movie.  Great info on forgeries, book making,engraving and of course the history of books dealing with the \\"devil.\\"    I read this in English first and was so impressed I had to read the original.  I found the original as easy to read as any English novel.
0765348276|5.0|When the Grandmaster died, many of us mourned not only the passing of a fine human being but an era. No one since has quite captured the unique Heinlein style, at least on a sustainable basis, even though he hinted that he thought it was teachable.<br /><br />Greats such as John Barnes, Peter F. Hamilton, James P. Hogan and more have since arisen. Each has written some remarkable stuff.<br /><br />But, reading this book, I literally could not tell that it was penned by someone other than RAH. Were this happening in a few decades, I would think John Scalzi RAH reborn.<br /><br />In a sense, he is. I look forward to savoring the rest of the books in this series, and beyond.<br /><br />May you prosper and continue to expand our imaginations toward the stars, sir.<br /><br />PS--Having read more of Scalzi's SF, I have to say that his sense of humor is better than Robert Heinlein's.
B000P0J024|5.0|My husband had wanted this CD for years, but I had been unable to find it since it had been out of print for so long.  He was so surprised when I gave it to him, and absolutely loves it.  The quality is excellant and of course so is the music! We shared it with friends and they were all going to go out and get themselves a copy as well.
0140143505|5.0|I just read this amazing collection of correspondence between the author and the employees of a small bookshop in London in one sitting. It was entertaining, culturally enlightening and it had a quaintness about it due to the letters being written in the years immediately following WWII.<br /><br />The friendship that develops between Helene Hanff as a result of her generosity toward the staff of the bookshop is really endearing and the reader feels like he or she really knows these people after enjoying this short read.<br /> A very unusual and highly enjoyable glimpse into the lives of others through their correspondence. Highly recommended for booklovers , anglophiles and others.
B000FS9FCG|1.0|When I saw the trailers for this movie, I thought it would be a thought provoking film, artsy, and action-packed.    Instead, it turned out to be over-the-top, utterly predictable, and seemed to drag on. My boyfriend put it perfectly as \\"excrutiatingly painful\\".    The hero was annoyingly over-dramatic. I wanted to smack some sense into the heroine/love-interest. And many other characters had us hollering, \\"What the heck did you expect?!?\\"    The political statements, though obscenely transparent, didn't bother me as much the rest of the story-lines.    The film had potential (which is why the minimum 1 star rating isn't bothering as much as it could). It fell severely short of what it could have been.    I'm glad I waited for it to go down in price before I bought the DVD (and didn't see it in theaters). I don't think I would have paid more than $2 for it if I had known how it turned out to be. Unfortunately, I paid quite a bit more than that... and ended up wasting a couple hours of my life in the process. (Can I have that time back, please???)
1594489505|5.0|Just as good if not better than \\"The Kite Runner.\\"  The author weaves a beautifully tragic story that you can't put down.  While reading this book I felt as if I were watching a movie in my mind.  I have recommended this book to many friends and they have all loved it.
1594489505|5.0|This is truly one of the best books that I have ever read.  Hosseini has a way of pulling you into the plot until you never want the book to end.  He is a brilliant author.  I loved Kite Runner, but I loved this book even more.
032147404X|4.0|A great book for starters, Scott Kelby never talks down to his audience. There's a few things that I wish he slowed down to explain a little more, but no book can cover everything in photography, I guess (well, not unless it's really heavy).<br /><br />A really good book to carry around as a guide, given its size and amount of useful information.
B00000DLUO|1.0|I have to agree with the last review.  I love Bill Evans... but this album is 90% trash.  The orchestration adds nothing to the music except echoing Evan's -mostly- substandard improvisation.  It sounds like he's making music out of habit not desire.  The only interesting thing is the sound of the keyboard.  Try one of the four albums he made Scott LaFaro!!!!!!!!!  All are clasics.
B00004XMTJ|1.0|I have heard about Cats for years now so thought Id look at it and see what all the fuss was about. I HATED it! Its rather vulgar in spots, lots of catting around and really tragic that the cats finaly gave the OLD cat respect when she was dying and not before...sad and stupid...
0931838401|5.0|Bought this McKeown's Price Guide to Antique and Classic Cameras, 2005-2006 as a gift for my father and he loves to use it as a ref. the book has every camera in it.. Although it doesn't go in to detail about the camera's in it, it does go over the year it was manufactered and little know things about it.
B000JJS8TM|4.0|This is a product for the die hard Beatles fans as some of the mixing is very different than were used to
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is nature documentary like it has never been shown before. I am deeply grateful to the BBC for funding this - finally there's tax payers' money put to a good use! - and hope that many, many people will change their attitude towards nature conservancy after seeing this series. We only have this one planet, and Planet Earth shows it in its most stunning beauty, grandeur - and fragility. To my mind the best DVD of this set is the last, which contains three features on suggestions by various scientists and organizations like WWF about how to save this fragile beauty. There are still several ways to do it, and although the disagreement among the experts interviewed on this disc shows how complex a challenge this is, it also offers hope. Just listen to Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, founder of the Green Belt Movement, talk about the value of clean air and water versus \\"things\\" that we in the West treasure as luxury items, and then consider what each and every one of us can do to help. It's not that difficult.  A book I am currently reading that ties in very well with this - apart from the obvious \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" - is [[ASIN:0807085731 When the Rivers Run Dry: Water--The Defining Crisis of the Twenty-first Century]]
0783240287|5.0|I love love love this movie. Donny is so much fun to watch, the music is really cool...my kids sing the songs all the time, so catchy.
B0002EQ7E2|5.0|Paul Simon peaked with this masterwork.  He will never return to this form.    \\"Graceland\\" is without equal.  \\"Diamonds On the Soles of Her Shoes\\" is an idiosyncratic tour-de-force.  \\"You Can Call Me Al\\" -- well, you already know that one.    If I had to rate all the CDs in my collection, this would be in the top three or four.  It's so far beyond Simon's prior works, and so much better than today's dreck, it's difficult to explain.
0393061434|2.0|This book is interesting because it gives an answer to  the following questions:  1) Does Steve Wozniak live up to his status hardware genius?  2) Could he be a role model for engineers?    Lets start with the latter.  Being an electrical engineer myself, I'm always looking for examples  of successful fellow engineers who 'made it'. These people  can serve as an example showing that one of the best professions  is the world is also 'cool' and rewarding.  The nerdy and introverted image of engineers is detrimental  in attracting young people to the profession.      Unfortunately, Steve Wozniak's autobiography confirms every  conceivable prejudice about nerd engineers. He is shy, he  kicks on geeky pleasures, he's immature, and  probably has never read a real book in his life. His  political insights (e.g. on the war in Vietnam) are shallow  at best....     With Steve Wozniak as role model, no sane kid will consider  a career in engineering, unfortunately.       The writing is awfully bad. The book reads like the  unfinished first version of a manuscript.    His ghostwriter writes on her  web site that she deliberately picked the style to   reflect the way that Steve talks. Wrong choice: She   should have protected  him for this rambling disaster and she should have   pushed through on some key details. One example:    The fate of the other people who were on board the   airplane that Steve crashed is not properly mentioned.  It makes the Woz appear as a self-centered person.      Now to the original question: is 'the Woz' indeed a genius,  or was he just at the right spot at the right time?  After reading the book, it appears to be the latter.  Though there are not many technical details in the book,  it is clear that the projects he pets himself on the back for are   quite simple, even for 1970ies standards. They are well   in the reach of averagely competent hardware geeks. His key  'apple' idea was to combine the TV-graphics of the 'pong' game  with a microprocessor, essentially making a one  of the early graphics cards for a computer.   He was one of the first, but likely not the only one  who made this (though the book suggests otherwise).   In 1975 the time was simply ready for this, all it needed was  the entrepreneur spirit of Steve Jobs to make it happen.  In the 1980ies the automatic logic synthesis revolution has  made Steve Wozniaks digital hardware speciality obsolete.  It appears that he has not kept up with the field.     Steve Wozniak was clearly a very competent engineer in his time.  However badly written this book is, it is still very interesting to  get some glimpses of his side of the story.
B00005AREQ|2.0|While Jeff Beck's offering here as well as his \\"virtuosity\\" have been touted by many realms of guitar aficionadom, I can't really say that the album here (or really much of his work) represents the best of the fusion genre or even serves as a mindblowing example of how electric guitar can be played without a pick (something that many Beck devotees point out ad nauseam...ugh).  His ideas really don't coalesce all that well particularly here although \\"Cause We've ended as Lovers\\" has its moments but one song really doesn't cut it.      Anyway if you really want to delve into fusion from around this time more check out Parliament, Miles Davis (\\"Bitches Brew Era\\"), or Santana.  For good examples of electric guitarists who axe the pick (no pun intended) check out Mark Knopfler and Lindsey Buckingham.
1881273156|5.0|I found the material in this book very useful for a better understanding of what makes each of the people in my life feel loved. I also learned to understand myself more. I cringe as I read of some of the recommendations the author writes about having made to various couples, and the \\"quick fix\\" ideas. I would however recommend this book as a valuable resource. Especially for any couple who were willing to apply what they can learn about each other for the purpose of having each other feel more loved.
1582406723|4.0|First off, let me say I'm not a fan of horror movies and books, which is why I only rate it at 4 stars, But it's because of movies and books like this that I'm not a fan. They are just so well written in the sense of what really happens to us when the very world and society we've grown up in is completely taken from us. Second, the graphics are amazingly realistic. I've seen some \\"Horror\\" comics but they didn't insight any type of visual fear because there was no real detail in the graphics. Now, I'm not an expert of horror books and movies but I can say that this scared me stiff, pun...kind of intended. To be fair Zombies are something I've always had a childish fear of and I\\"m very frightened of especially since the recent zombie boom in the media so for them to be the topic was off the bat a scary topic for me. I've got a huge imagination that brings these types of comics, Zombies/Vampires/aliens, alive in the sense, I'll want to look around me while reading or days after I've read them to feel safe, since it sticks with me. So, if your an avid reader and viewer of horror then my review isn't really for you, but if your someone who is interested by horror but don't like being absolutely horrified. Then this will surly do it's job to scary you out of your wits but give you the chance to just stop and close the book if it's too much.
B000QGDIKM|4.0|The Smashing Pumpkins are back. The legendary rock band, which blossomed like a dark rose in the musical wasteland of the 1990s.<br /><br />Okay, only frontman Billy Corgan and drummer Jimmy Chamberlin have returned from the original lineup, and the absences can be detected. But their return album \\"Zeitgeist\\" is still worthy of epic praise -- dark, passionate hard-rock, written with a darkly poetic sweep. Too bad the extra material isn't so good.<br /><br />The drums smash, the bass roars like unleashed tornado. \\"Is everyone afraid?/Is everyone ashamed?/They're running towards their holes to find out/Apocalyptic thieves/Are lost amongst our dead,\\" Corgan drawls, telling us a story of gas masks, Kafka and fear.<br /><br />It's followed with the roiling rocker \\"7 Shades of Black,\\" with the level of depression you'd expect (\\"And without peer/And without fear/I'm without anyone at all!\\"). Then it pours into a series of blazing hard-rockers -- soaring grimy epics, buzzing and cascading bass rockers, a stripped-down melodic tune, and the soaringly exquisite \\"Pomp and Circumstances,\\" which is only marred by Corgan singing \\"la la la la...\\"<br /><br />\\"Zeitgeist\\" probably won't be gently compared to the Pumpkins' earlier classics, especially since it doesn't have James Iha and D'arcy Wretzy from the original lineup -- valuable talents both. But taken on its own virtues, it's brilliant hard-rock -- epic, dark, and with moments of sheer poetry woven into the stormy music.<br /><br />If I had a main complaint, it would be that the softer songs are rare here, and that the bass doesn't have that epic quality in some of the songs. But Corgan is blazingly passionate in his playing, layering and building a storm of driving guitar and fuzzy bass. He pushes on the fiery melodies of each song, with Chamberlin smashing the drums beside him. These guys sound kinetic.<br /><br />And Corgan's nasal voice sneers and drawls through the harder songs, but he can also sound wistful and tender, like when he sings, \\"that's the way my love is.\\" And he pours plenty of passion into his songs, which seem to balance out between the happy and sad -- on one side, a crumbling, bitter apocalypse, and on the other, \\"no shadows follow me unsung.\\"<br /><br />Some of his songs aren't up to par lyrically, like \\"God and Country.\\" But Corgan spins his weird poetry in other songs, like the the ethereal \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\": \\"Torn, broken and frayed/Oh don't we face/War, sunshine and grace/Oh won't you stay/For a while/We can fail in style...\\"<br /><br />The special edition of \\"Zeitgeist\\" also comes with a eightyish-page booklet, but to be perfectly honest, the booklet is kind of pointless. It's primarily filled with arty photographs -- Paris Hilton in front of a burgeoning nuclear explosion, a grim reaper on the presidential podium, a Roman soldier, coffins, and quite a few others. They're interesting photos, but not really worth exerting yourself for, and they don't reveal much about the album itself.<br /><br />The Pumpkins aren't quite all they once were here, but Corgan and Chamberlin are enough to make \\"Zeitgeist\\" a brilliant hard-rock album with some vintage flourishes.

They're interesting photos, but not really worth exerting yourself for, and they don't reveal much about the album itself.     The Pumpkins aren't quite all they once were here, but Corgan and Chamberlin are enough to make \\"Zeitgeist\\" a brilliant hard-rock album with some vintage flourishes. Just take it for itself, with no comparisons.

0061122416|4.0|You can't expect much depth in a book that you could finish in about three hours of casual reading.  That is why you should discount some of the more negative reviews complaining about the book being childish or overly shallow.  In fact, considering the length of this book, I'd say that the reward for reading it is extremely good.<br /><br />The Alchemist is about pursuing your destiny and dreams.  When challenged by the future, you should follow your heart and trust in your ability to succeed rather than stay at home where you are comfortable.  As the boy Santiago leaves his home and travels through North Africa, fate bullies and pampers him in a roller-coaster of events that eventually lead to fulfillment.  He meets people from one end of the spectrum to the other and they all influence his journey in some way.  Other smaller but still important lessons are scattered throughout the book, such as that people who love you should understand your needing to pursue your destiny even if it makes them less comfortable.  As you read this book you'll find yourself examining your own life again and again.. Have I followed my 'Personal Legend'?<br /><br />The most interesting aspect of the book in my opinion is the constant but mixed religious signals.  At first glance, it is obvious that Santiago and the 'good' characters share a basically Christian belief system, but as Coelho discusses fate, evolution, and souls, a very New Age sort of system emerges.  I can see why a couple of reviewers related this book to [[ASIN:0446671002 The Celestine Prophecy]], with its story of whole world interconnectedness and purposeful evolution to become some sort of god-being after reaching individual Personal Legends and so on..  While its not very distracting from the story or the [excellent] lessons of the book, it is still very noticeable.<br /><br />This was my first novel by Coelho, and I have to say that I was quite impressed.  While maintaining a simple down-to-earth prose, he is nonetheless able to evoke very powerful imagery and strong feelings.  I for one wouldn't hesitate to pick up another of his books.very powerful imagery and strong feelings.  I for one wouldn't hesitate to pick up another of his books.
0618680004|5.0|Humor is only one pleasing feature that transpires Dawkin's writing. The other is the satisfaction the author must feel by laying out his case with such common sense.     It is not difficult to fill a book with criticism of religion. This does not seem to be the primary intention of the author but he rather puts his effort in presenting a good alternative to religion, with plausible answers to the question of our existence, and explaining how moral is unrelated to religion.     I think that one of his most positive accomplishments is in showing that atheists are also good people.

0785819118|3.0|Darwin's theory begins with individual variability(individual variation).     What does individual variability mean? Not to mention, it means that one individual differs from another one. A group of different individuals makes species or genus. When the individual variability proceeds to a certain degree, the creature produces defective offspring. This creates the difference of species or the wall of species. So we tell about biological diversity.    But there is no continuity between the individual variability and the change of species(evolution). For examble, at which point would our ancestors change to other species, when we go back to our distant ancestors? Our ancestors hold their continuity as species and they do not break.    Nevertheless Darwin connects individulal variability with the variation of species. It is because his definition of species is very obvious and the definition of classification is also not clear.    Hegel says in §229 of \\"Shorter Logic\\": \\"Definition involves the three organic elements of the notion: the universal or proximate genus (genus proximum), the particular or specific character of the genus (qualitas specifica), and the individual, or object defined.\\"(From the site of MIA)    To put it briefly, when there are more objects than two: the identity(commonality) of the two objects is the universal; the distinction(difference) of them is the particular; the two objects is the individual. In other words, it is the whole-part relationship. Therefore Darwin lacks this distinction, that is, the particular.    Therefore, however significantly the parts may change(and the too major change of parts produces defective offspring), so far as the whole does not change, the transition of species does not occur. The theory of explaining evolution does not exist.    Only the hierarchical structure of creatures explains biological diversity.    Without the hierarchical structure, Darwin was not able to flow it and to tell about evolution. The evolution lacking the hierarchical structure is only `change.' Here there is only a continuum.    He did not find discontinuity in the nature and understand the aspect of distiction. There are an infinite abyss between part and whole, and between whole and whole.    Finally it hits fundamental limits, or the problem of `infinitesimal,' and this problem could be solved by `0.999~ = 1,' which would make the theory probabilistic and statistical.    Also, `the 0.999~ = 1' makes the distinction indiscriminating or continuous. Thereby in the continuum there is `a middle species,' so-called `the missinglink.' And infinite middle species.    But, ignoring the hierarchical structure, the fact that Darwin was seduced by the continuum forms a grave crime.
0374105235|5.0|My last review was lost so this one is brief.  This is the story of a very young boy who has a large cross to carry.  Growing up in war torn Sierra Leone, Ishmael is inducted into the army at the age of 12.  For three years he is consumed with running from village to village to escape the wrath of the rebels and with killing, for which he becomes somewhat of an expert.  He is stripped of his conscience and the ability to think for himself.  His saving grace, I believe, are severe migranes, usually accompanied by horrendous nightmares, from which he has to relive the atrocities of his daily life.    Ishmael is unique in that he learns to carry this cross and discovers what his purpose in life is despite it.  Ishmael becomes a young man of courage and wisdom beyond his years.  Despite his dearth of fond childhood memories, Ishmael carries his cross and survives to become a remarkable young man.    I wish him well
B000OLGCHA|1.0|Obviously the producers have it figured that they can put in any music that touches on the John Williams theme from the first three movies and it will pass muster and save them money. How sad for us the listeners. This album, as the one before it, show that the way to keep the series with some consistency that also holds them together is to keep the same composer which is not happening any more. All the star wars movies; most of the james bond films; the rocky films; back to the future films; the first two batman films; rambo movies; first few die hard movies, all got this key thing and their sequels were terrifically enhanced. Williams did all three Indiana Jones movies and each was a better soundtrack than the one before; he did the first two Superman films and his score was used in the third too. The fourth Superman movie fell off the wagon and died in the box office. The fifth, Superman Returns, used some unknown composer for most of the score and it was lousy and forgettable.   This new Harry Potter film is great but the soundtrack is a waste almost entirely and won't hold up by itself the way Potters 1-3 all do/did. Save your money on this one and tell the producers by not buying it that the consumers are not so easily conned and maybe they will pay Williams to do the next movie.

I am now ready to make an oven though, and try my own recipes.
038572179X|5.0|Atonement is a deep, difficult, and gripping novel.  I found it to be more disturbing than Amsterdam and Saturday, and comparable to Enduring Love (see my reviews).      I found Atonement harder to start and get interested in than McEwan's other novels, but once engaged I was fully gripped.  Do not be put off by the innocent and guileless first forty or fifty pages.  This is a story of passionate love, and hatred, anger, and violence.  It has war writing that is reminiscent, and I would say, as good as Waugh and Remarque.      McEwan evokes the atmosphere of the chaotic retreat to Dunkirk, and London just before the blitz.  I assume that he has done the research that he reports on the final page of the book.  He weaves this with idyllic English country life, and a bit of contemporary London life.  One of the very valuable features of Atonement that has not been mentioned by other reviewers is that McEwan highlights the work and tribulations of military nurses--often ignored and under appreciated.  He is able to convey some what they were facing and how they struggled with facing it.      As usual with McEwan novels the plot, the story, is somewhat implausible and just a bit bizarre.  Also McEwan lavishly uses what I consider to be cheap writing tricks with just a hint of post-modern confusion (things I usually detest), but he does it with such charm and elegance that I don't mind a bit.      There is not as much humor in Atonement as in Amsterdam and Enduring Love.  This is a dark novel, a painful story with little to relieve the darkness.  I think this is what the years leading up to WWII were like in England.  I almost wept at the end, old fool that I am.    I thoroughly enjoyed Atonement, I am glad I read it, I recommend it highly.  Reading this book is a worthwhile way to spend your precious time.  I was entertained and edified, as I have been by McEwan's other novels that I have read.  What more could you ask from a writer?

B00000K31Q|4.0|\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" (1999) is probably the all-time most ambitious of the teen comedies. Updates of classic literature like this have become relatively common; \\"Emma\\" is adapted as \\"Clueless\\", \\"Othello\\" as \\"O\\", \\"Pygmalion\\" becomes ''She's All That'', etc. etc. \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is an adaptation of Shakespeare's \\"Taming of the Shrew\\" (which has also been adapted as the Broadway musical and film \\"Kiss Me Kate\\").    The strange title is less Shakespeare derived than a play on the Elizabeth Barrett Browning sonnet that begins ''How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.'' Even knowing this, the title withholds its relationship to the film content until the climatic scene late in the film when Katerina (Julia Stiles) reads her poem (in iambic pentameter) to the class: \\"I hate the way you talk to me, and the way you cut your hair. I hate the way you drive my car. I hate it when you stare. I hate your big dumb combat boots, and the way you read my mind. I hate you so much it makes me sick; it even makes me rhyme. I hate the way you're always right. I hate it when you lie. I hate it when you make me laugh, even worse when you make me cry. I hate it when you're not around, and the fact that you didn't call. But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, not even close, not even a little bit, not even at all\\". Either the producers can't count of they didn't like the sound of \\"13 Things I Hate About You\\"     The film was fairly popular at the time of its release and made a considerable amount of money,  but critical reaction was mixed. Most of the negative reviews came from critics who felt the film was too distanced from the original; specifically that Katerina was not Shakespeare's mega-shrew and that her taming was just too tame. While these observations are correct, in this case toning down the original makes the film work better. A less gritty story allows for more lyrical storytelling and better unity with the great pop soundtrack and the inventive cinematography. And few will miss the original's out-of-control misogyny. The film goes out on fantastic rotational helicopter shot of the group \\"Letters from Cleo\\" as they perform the closing song on top of spectacular Stadium High School in Tacoma.     The story begins with obstetrician Walter Stratford's (Larry Miller) grudging agreement to allow his younger daughter Bianca (Larisa Oleynik) to date if her older sister Katerina (Stiles) starts dating. Walter's occupation has made him super-paranoid about teen pregnancy, but he feel quite safe with this compromise because Katerina is a brain with little interest in boys and an abrasive enough personality to drive away anyone who might be attracted to her.     Miller and Stiles are exceptional in these roles, the best performances of their careers. Oleynik (formally Alex Mack) does not have nearly as much to work with but is solid in her role; if you view the film a second time you can better appreciate the subtle tease she brings to this role. My main criticism is that the film has the same dynamic as \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\", with the abrasive tomboy significantly more desirable than the foxy girl every guy is after. Back in her \\"Alex Mack\\" days Oleynik was the #1 ranked female in a People Magazine survey of the most beautiful person in the world. I don't see it and I'm pretty sure that I have a lot of company.     One interesting bit of trivia is that Oleynik went on to attend and graduate from Sarah Lawrence College, the school that Katerina wants to attend in the film.     Female viewers will generally be pleased with Heath Ledger as Patrick Verona (afterall the action takes place at Padua High School),  who is hired by two of Bianca's admirers to tame the shrew.  Joey Donner (Andrew Keegan) is the obnoxious pretty boy who is cruising for his comeuppance throughout the film; but he is not close to the bad guy standard set by  \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" and Pretty in Pink\\". Allison Janney is hilarious as a porno-writing guidance counselor.     I really liked the tentative feeling between Patrick and Katerina. In one of the most enjoyable scenes he appears in the grandstands while she is at soccer practice and sings ''I Love You Baby'' over the P.A. system, having bribed the school's marching band to accompany him from down on the field.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|First off:  In order to fully appreciate Serenity, I highly recommend watching Firefly first.<br /><br />Now, Serenity.  This story was even richer and funnier than Firefly, which I didn't think possible.  By the end of Firefly, the actors had formed a chemistry, which I'm happy to say was still there for Serenity.  The characters played off each other in wonderous ways, and I was so so sad when the story ended.  I wanted more.<br /><br />We got some answers to the questions proposed in Firefly, but not all.  Joss Whedon did a marvelous job telling his story in this medium, and hats off to him for working so hard to bring us, the fans, at least this much.  He's become one of my favorite writers for TV or big screen.

0440418569|3.0|I have finally complete Pullman's His Dark Material trilogy. While I really enjoyed 'The Golden Compass', I was disappointed with 'The Subtle Knife' and 'The Amber Spyglass'.    'The Amber Spyglass' completes the tale of Lyra and Will. Two children who are attempting to save the world(s). This book picks up with Will teamed up with two (2) angels after have just lost his father. Lyra has been capture by her mother and is being held in a drug induced sleep.    We learn that Lyra and Will have a crucial part in saving the world and forces align to help or oppose the children. I found the situations that the children are facing to be very stressful, but the children seem to roll with the punches a little too easily.    Pullman does make his views on religion known. This didn't bother me as much as other readers. I can see how some parents may be concerned with young adults reading these books. However, I think that these books are still just a story and one author's viewpoint. Take the religious aspects with a grain of salt.    On the whole I thought the books were ok. The first is really good, which can draw a reader into reading the other two books hoping that the story continues at the same level. Unfortunately, for me this didn't happen. Still the story is still worth a try.

Yes, I have my favorites, but George could write a story about a peanut butter sandwich and it would be a page-turner.  I don't mind a story line that encompasses five to ten novels, as long as the author holds my interest.  Thus far, George has done just that.

1416914285|5.0|This book was recommended to me on Amazon and by many others so I decided to read it. After reading such an excellent book I began to wonder why quite a lot of readers gave it only one to three stars. The plot is gripping and the characters are realistic and fun. One of the only problems I found (which I barely noticed because the book was so great!)<br />that she tends to explain things a bit too much but besides that I do think this book was an excellent read! I definetly recommend it!<br /><br />  This book is about a girl named Clary (Clarissa) who witnessed three strange teenagers murder a boy whom they claim is really a demon. Clary is trying to forget the incident when Jace, one of the killers came back. From there the book sets off into tragic events leaving Clary at wits end: Her apartment is trashed and her mother is taken from her, she finds out secrets and lies that her mother kept hidden, she fights vampires, runs into werewolves, starts to fall in love, and finally finds the man that took her mother - Valentine... Wow!<br /><br />I highly recommend this books to ANYBODY that enjoys fantasies, monsters, magic, action, and humor. Happy Reading!

0143038419|1.0|I belong to a book club of 15 highly educated women. We picked this book based on publishers' reviews. We cannot comprehend how it got such great reviews. With the exception of one group member, all of us thought the book was shallow, contrived and irritating. We did not find the author likable. None of us would ever want to take a trip with her because of her endless chatter. She did not illicit sympathy from the group, we think because she just wasn't real. She skidded on the surface with little depth of feelings. Her story might have been more believable if we hadn't known about her $200,000 advance to write the book. It seems the money was her real motivation, and not to honestly share her journey. We gave it 14 thumbs down, 1 thumb up.

We all remember how difficult high school was and how much harder it is for kids today.  I was fortunate to not be one of those ridiculed on a daily basis and I was witness to those who were.  And to think, anyone of them could've taken the road less traveled.  Teenagers have so much pressure and more power to change the world for better or worse than they know.  Even if you were the homecoming queen you can relate to this book when you read it.  Does it scare you? yes. Does it make you look back and think of your own days in high school and wonder? yes.

0812974611|4.0|What do aqueducts and volcanoes have in common? A lot, in Robert Harris's remarkably fast paced and lucid historical fiction \\"Pompeii\\".  The Roman aqueducts are one of the towering achievements of ancient engineering. Built to lengths of 50 kilometers with a constant gradient of 1 meter per kilometer, the aqueducts snaked around mountains and valleys to supply water to the Roman cities. These aqueducts were constructed and maintained by the Aquarii, the hydrology engineers of Rome.    It is in 79AD, as we meet the protagonist Marcus Attilius Primus, young, incorruptible, recently widowed and the new Aquarius of the aqueduct Augusta. Aqua Augusta, a massive 50-mile aqueduct that supplies water to a quarter million Roman people is suddenly failing. The previous Aquarius has disappeared mysteriously. The perturbed Marcus Attilius skillfully determines that the aqueduct is facing some obstruction near the city of Pompeii, situated beneath the famed Mount Vesuvius.    Racing against time, Attilius forms a small expedition and dashes to Pompeii, promising the Admiral of the Fleet, Pliny The Elder, that he will restore the water supply in a couple of days. Pompeii, a profligate corrupt city , is the center of the story.    As the young engineer is working feverishly to detect and clear the man-made conduit, another conduit made by the Gods is forming under the bowels of Vesuvius. The man-made one bringing water, the one from the Gods bringing fire. The two stories collide and as we know from history, the Gods' conduit erupts, devastatingly.    Few writers bring out the details from a long dead civilization as beautifully as Robert Harris does. As you read the book, you feel the heat of the sun, the smell of the sulphur in the springs, the noises from the streets and ports of Ancient Rome, the degrading sights from the brothels of the city and the awe-inspiring dread from a cloud of pumice stones raining death on Pompeii.     This book is at times a morality play, at timesa love story, at times a mystery and at others, a fast paced action thriller. But mostly this story is about the two conduits, between the man-made one and the one wrought by God, one bringing life, the other death.    A fast and entertaining read.

B000000W5L|4.0|I was imagining this is to be the Stones' \\"White Album\\", right? - a double album which coulda made an incredible single album. A big reason it's not is that the Beatles' opus was wildly eclectic, with 1930s crooners, art songs, even garage music. This '72 effort, with all the verbiage about rediscovered echoey dungeons in somewhere in France, has a very consistent sound, thanks to the Glimmer Twins and all their good friends (Bobby Keys, Jim Price, Bill Plummer, et. al.). Gotta say, though, there are some tentative \\"B-side\\" quality cuts, and it's to their credit that the Stones open the double-album with one of them, \\"Rocks Off\\". Let's see, we'll also put \\"Casino Boogie\\", \\"Ventilator Blues\\" on the shelf....just kidding.<br />\\"Rip This Joint\\" was probably the best pure R & R song for that whole year, despite the high profiles that year of '50s originators like Ricky Nelson (\\"Garden Party\\"), Chuck Berry (\\"My Ding-A-Ling\\" and \\"Reelin' And Rockin'), Elvis Presley (\\"Burning Love\\"), and Little Richard (\\"Rockin' With The King\\" - Canned Heat with LR). When it came to roots music, they could do it better than all of them (except for when Richard showed up with his full band, at that time).<br />They proved they understood the blues, too, delivering on Slimp Harpo's \\"Shake Your Hips\\" (saw Mr. Penniman perform it in Trenton, NJ, in 2003 - did he dig the Stones' version?). \\"Turd On The Run\\", despite the lousy title, brings 'em back to the '60s and their many Bo Diddley \\"tributes\\", this one takes off like an SUV leaving the parking lot of a New Jersey community college at 6pm on a Friday, and never slows down.<br />Now to the real heavyweights, and you can name 'em, \\"Tumbling Dice\\", the super hit; \\"Sweet Black Angel\\", a beautiful folk-blues said to have been written about Activist Angela Davis; \\"Happy\\", still sounding great.<br />\\"Shine A Light\\", featuring Billy Preston, re-emerges with even more brightness. A real gem, which should have proven to be a true Pop perennial.<br />\\"Sweet Virginia\\", almost straight ahead Country, also warrants reappraisal as an almost \\"lost\\" artifact.<br />Small criticism: voices are mixed too far back; this together with the occasional monochromatic sound image, can put the listener on edge.<br />I guess it's in the spirit of serious bluesmen, combing that dank and dusty basement overseas for some scent of the American Delta.ost straight ahead Country, also warrants reappraisal as an almost \\"lost\\" artifact.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I loved this version the actors made the characters come to life and appear human.  While this version is not completely in line with the novel itself it completely captured me.  I would absolutely LOVE to see this same group of actors take the novel in it entirety to the screen.  They put the other versions to shame in the ability of the cast alone.      If you are a fan of the novel itself I highly recommend this version to you.  If you are expecting it to play out exactly as the book you will be highly disappointed but highly satisfied with the acting in itself.  Very loveable and endearing just as the novel itself.
6305882592|5.0|Quirky movie that is a cult classic.  Bud Cort is great and so is Ruth Gordon.  As the title of my post says Cat rocks.
B000244FDW|2.0|After watching BBC's effort on the novel itself while they withstood in keeping with the storyline and did an exceptional job in doing such I was extremely disheartened in the job of the actors.  I did not find myself drawn into the story such as the novel,the A&E Version or even the version of Keara Knightly.  Matter of fact I found myself bored out of my witts with it.  There was no real humanity offered onscreen, the characters seemed lacking, the actors seemed like they were doing a job and not really acting... this by far was a disappointment in itself.      I wanted to fall in love with the characters and instead I found myself disliking them.  The beautiful and graceous Jane seemed disinteresting and flat almost cold.  The disatisfied Elizabeth had more affection to her than her sister and sadly the goofy and silly younger sisters did not come across as such.  Perhaps I had been expecting better acting so my expectations were not met.    If you are looking to fall in love with the characters as you did while reading the novel itself I would highly suggest getting the version with Knightly, Mcfayden and sutherland... as they appear more human and actually breath fresh life into their roles.  While that version has been changed in some degrees and cut down to fit the movie theatre time frames it has a MUCH more likeable and loveable air to it.    Sorry BBC, while you managed to keep within the guildelines of the novel (BRAVO for that)  your actors seemed very lacking and inhuman in their attmempts to become the parts they were paid to play.
B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is one of the most talented bands I have ever heard, both musically & lyrically. They have a sensual, melodic, rhythmic, dramatic, powerful, gnawing, raw, yet symphonic sound. The lyrics are educated, poetic, unnerving, yet truthful all at the same time. Their music is hauntingly beautiful in that there is nothing else like it out there. Their blend of opus-like orchestration, powerful spine-tingling rock sounds & intelligent lyrics is sheer genius! Maynard James Keenan's voice is as hypnotic as it is chameleon-like. His range from melodic to raw is seamless, intense, & wonderfully refreshing in a world of today's \\"been there, heard that\\" sound of most rock bands. Danny Carey's skill with the drums is unparalleled. Oh my God, the DRUMS! They eat at you, they move you, they draw you in & they change the surface of your skin! Danny ROCKS! He is the essence of what I crave in \\"the beat\\", \\"the hit\\", \\"the soul\\" of rock! He is splendid! Bassist Justin Chancellor & guitarist Adam Jones are brilliant! They seduce your ears with their incredible skill. This band is easily one of the BEST there is & I know that they will stand the test of time. Rarely is there such an incredible union of deliciously talented musicians & I am truly grateful that they found each other. How unfortunate the music world would be without Tool!

0425200469|5.0|I'd read this book once in primary school, and re-read it again last night (in a single sitting, that is!).  I enjoyed it much more thoroughly than I remember enjoying it earlier, and I must say as an Agatha Christie fan that this is her BEST novel.    The plot around the death in this novel is flawless and there's no question left in the minds of the reader once the mystery is unfolded.  The author, as usual, kept me waiting till the very end to find out the solution to the mystery - and I experienced extreme pleasure and the 'aha' effect on reading the end.  Wow, this is definitely a masterpiece, and one of Christie's best works.  Highly recommended.
014017821X|4.0|A very good collection of short stories.  We had to read this for our English Literature course and I'm very glad I did. Carter is a very talented writer and this book deserves the recognition and awards it got.  The best stories to watch out for are;    The Bloody Chamber,  The Tiger's Bride  The Snow Child  The Werewolf    Carter's language is very elaborate, so if you're going to read it, do as my English tutor said; \\"Read actively. Have a pen in your hand and a dictionary next to you\\". Trust me, she was right.  A very good read if you can understand what is going on. All the stories are based on old fairytales (i.e. The Tiger's Bride is based on Beauty and The Beast) so if you can work out how the story is similar and find links you should be able to appreciate the stories.
1594489505|5.0|I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down. I loved the Kite Runner so when I saw he came out with another book, I bought it immediately. The plot was great, I didn't want the book to end. The way Hosseini wrote from a woman's point of view amazed me. I don't generally like when men do that, but he was able to give a convincing a woman's account of life in Afghanistan. I highly recommend the book.
B000J103PC|4.0|Obviously this weekend my wife had control of the television.  That's alright though because whenever that happens I usually end up having lower expectations then usual and find the viewing experience to be better than expected.  This was not the case with The Devil Wears Prada, as this little movie did have a lot of hype, even among movie snobs and cinephiles like me.  It seemed that critically this was on a higher level than the chick flicks I typically find myself rolling my eyes to after my wife has gained control over the television.  After the viewing I think it is fair to say that The Devil Wears Prada deserves every bit of praise it has received in 2006.<br /><br />From what I understand this movie was adapted for the screen from a novel written a few years ago.  Andrea or Andy (Anne Hathaway) is a new Northwestern graduate and somewhat nerdy and awkward girl who just received a job as a co-assistant for a highly demanding editor of a fashion magazine named Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).  Andy is at least awkward and nerdy in Miranda's competitive and ostentatious world.  Most girls would love Andy's opportunity but Andy doesn't seem to care and for a while even sees herself as above the fashion culture.  Andy fails to fit in well and it grates on her.  She is also employed by a horribly demanding boss in Priestly.  Miranda Priestly is notorious and after some time Andy begins to enjoy the challenge, especially after the entire supporting cast in the film doubts she can last.  Also, Andy's opportunities will expand tremendously if she can prove to exist under Miranda for a significant amount of time.  There are good side plots and certain developments which I won't reveal, but rest assured the film is fun.<br /><br />The screenplay is written to be palpable to a wide audience and that can make a film outside of this viewer's favorite genres more entertaining.  However, it is the cast in The Devil Wears Prada that makes it a success.  Meryl Streep definitely delivered one of the most effective comedic performances I have seen in years.  Her nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved for several reasons. I hold out hope that it is her understanding of the dry humor and arrogance in Miranda's character that earned her the nomination and not the mushy scenes that typically earn attention from the Academy.  Meryl is outstanding and the character allows for an amazing display of her talent.  To Anne Hathaway's credit, she holds her own in each scene and her ability to make Andy likeable in a situation where I could've just as easily sympathized with the villain deserves some praise as well.  I was even more surprised by the supporting cast here, especially Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci who played distinctively different roles than I'm used to seeing them play.<br /><br />The Devil Wears Prada is a not a profound film that attempts to comment on larger things.  If it did, it would've failed.  That isn't to say the film lacks depth entirely and manages not to say anything.  It has its points.  I had trouble at first trying to figure out where The Devil Wears Prada stood as a critique of the fashion culture it is showing us, but that was not what the film set out to do.  The fashion world is merely the film's setting to tell this story.  One of the best messages I got from The Devil Wears Prada also happened to be the one that placed the film squarely against the grain of on-the-surface similar stories.  The story allowed me to pragmatically support its villain.  If Miranda Priestly were a man she would have the respect of her colleagues but instead they fear her.  That point brought The Devil Wears Prada away from conventional comedy and into a coming of age story for Andy as in many ways she began to respect Miranda just as we do.  It cut much deeper than I expected, even with all that hype.one of the most effective comedic performances I have seen in years.  Her nomination for an Oscar was well-deserved for several reasons.

0783107986|3.0|While I enjoy the series,buyer beware this NOT a faithful reproduction.  Case in point the invasion of poland.That was a whole episode,and quite frankly it set the tone for the whole series of battles that followed,it totally truncated the conquest of poland.By my estimation about 20 minutes!.A  truly great episode.I have not reached the the phony war episode yet....but if i don't get the song.....\\"le boomb.etc\\" just before the germans attack this babby's goes back to COSTCO!

Prince is at his best live and this concert, performed on the last night of 1999 was truly one of his best live performances.    He opens with Purple Rain's \\"Let's Go Crazy (B-side \\"She's Always in My Hair) and closes with the theme of the night... the last time Prince ever performed \\"1999\\" live.... (I mean why should he? We will no longer be witnesses to the year 1999, only relive the memories of this incredible year.)    Without a doubt Rave Un2 The Year 2000 was a great concert, one that should be up there with the best live shows ever.

1582701709|4.0|The concept of the Law of Attraction is in no way new. Countless books have been written on the subject, some good, some bad. I have been \\"studying\\" the Law of Attraction for about 2 years now and have had a reasonable degree of success applying it into my life. After reading Excuse Me Your Life Is Waiting and Ask and It Is Given, The Secret is sort of a breath of fresh air to the subject. While Excuse Me can get on your nerves with all the feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeel stuff and Ask is more on the spiritual side, The Secret can be taken as a \\"Law of Attraction for Dummies\\" sort of thing. Easy and simple to read, I think it is a good buy. The downside is that there are no application exercises like the ones given on Ask...so my advice is, if you want something more comprehensive on the subject, get Ask and it is Given and use The Secret as a reminder and quick read.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Wow! What a fantastic movie and a genuine achievement in special effects Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is. The marriage of CGI and live action is seamless, and its saturated colours and striking production design make it one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen. From start to explosive finish I was riveted to the television screen, and alas, it made me wish I had only gone to see it while at my local cinema. Sky Captain is fast paced and exiting with a great cast of A Grade actors and actresses, and a good script. It has a vibrant and decidedly retro aesthetic that perfectly captures the look, feel and spirit of pulp science fiction from the 1930s and 40s. With its fearless heroes and heroines, giant robots, ray guns and rocket ships inspired by the likes of Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon, it is a true escapists delight. And to think it is brought to life almost entirely with cutting edge 21st Century technology in a truly breathtaking, elegant and stylish way. It's hard to believe that the star studded cast had only a minimal amount of props to work with... amazing!<br /><br />The Art Deco and Streamlined Moderne look of the film was for me a major part of its appeal with its subtle references to important industrial designers and architects from that bygone interwar era. We follow our heroes; Joe Sullivan (Jude Law) and Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) on a globetrotting adventure that takes them from a mythical and idealized modern metropolis (New York) that is under siege by an army of giant robots, to an exotic Shangri-La (Tibet) high, high up in the Himalayas. We then travel to the bottom of the ocean to confront the evil genius Dr. Totenkopf in his secluded island lair, the apparent source of the mechanical mayhem; for it is he who is plotting to destroy the world which he believes has become morally bankrupt and irredeemably decadent, and must be stopped by our daring heroes at all costs.<br /><br />While the plot is silly, predictable and formulaic and the acting a little too stiff and wooden, remember, Sky Captain is not an \\"art film\\" but an entertaining and over the top flight of fancy. The movie is also admittedly quite derivative; especially in terms of the Indiana Jones franchise and the computer game Crimson Skies, but this really doesn't detract from the film which is exceptionally well made (for a first time director) and extremely enjoyable. Something I find hard to fathom is that Sky Captain failed at the box office, for while not the best film I have ever seen, the extraordinary graphic quality and innovative presentation alone should have given it a high measure of success... and let's face it there are far worse movies being made out there today. So if you enjoy good old fashioned action-adventure movies in the vein of King Kong, The Mummy or Indiana Jones, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is for you. And even though it might not have much depth, it truly does have heart! So please don't be put off by the bad reviews; for in my humble opinion it is definitely one of the best films to be made in its genre for some years, and I look forward to the special edition DVD.d formulaic and the acting a little too stiff and wooden, remember, Sky Captain is not an \\"art film\\" but an entertaining and over the top flight of fancy.

B000N6TX1I|1.0|I rented this movie because I thought it sounded interesting. The only thing interesting about it is the concept, other than that I had no idea what was going on, was lost 90% of the time, and thought the movie was just plain dull. I'm so glad I didn't buy it.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Interview with the Vampire is probably the most intelligent vampire movie ever made, and if not, then it is certainly my favourite because Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles have the most well rounded and complex vampire characters ever put to pen. Characters like Lestat, Louis or Armand are charismatic, flawed and mysterious and always engage the reader... or in the case of this film, the viewer. This is a compellingly romantic movie that draws one inevitably into its rich and colourful tapestry of two codependent vampire's journey through time. Anne Rice's vampires are unique, to become a vampire you have to be given \\"the dark gift\\" not just bitten by a vampire; they are not afraid of crucifixes or holy water, garlic does not affect them, and not even a stake through the heart will kill them... they are afraid only of the sun. I really like the fact that Anne Rice has dispensed with most simplistic traditional vampire lore; and that her bewitching creations are not as two dimensionally evil as Bram Stoker's Count Dracula, or those overly charactertured vampires seen in B Grade movies.<br /><br />We first meet Louis (Brad Pitt) the narrator of this film in a sparsely decorated room in San Francisco, he is being interviewed by budding journalist Daniel Malloy (Christian Slater) who thinks he might be onto the story of his life. Louis was born in the late 18th Century as a southern plantation owner; he has just lost his beloved wife and child, and thus the will to live. One fateful night while out drunk in New Orleans he meets Lestat... and his life changes forever. Lestat (Tom Cruise) offers him two choices: drink from me so you can live forever, or you can die... Louis having nothing to lose chooses to become an immortal. Unlike most vampires Louis stubbornly holds on to the last vestiges of his humanity, refusing to hunt people he feeds off animals. After burning down his plantation manor he and Lestat move into a stylish townhouse in New Orleans, where they set about creating a new life for themselves. Louis and Lestat have a love-hate relationship; for they spend most of their time together bickering, fighting and arguing. Louis thinks Lestat is arrogant and spoilt (indeed he is called the brat prince!) and Lestat thinks Louis is moralistic and sentimental, so to heal the rift between them Lestat \\"adopts\\" a little girl whose mother has died of the plague. To make a vampire so young is a grave offence in vampire culture; and if Claudia (Kirsten Dunst) is found by other vampires she will most certainly be killed, but Lestat gives her \\"the dark gift\\" anyway. At first this calculated ploy works; Louis is happy with their \\"daughter\\" but as Claudia matures and her body doesn't grow she begins to ask questions, and to ultimately resent and despise Lestat. She convinces Louis to help her murder Lestat and dump his inert body in the Louisiana swamps; they then flee to 19th Century Europe, however Lestat is not so easily killed. When they arrive in The Old World they begin their search for other vampires in earnest; and their journey takes them throughout Eastern Europe, but sadly they have no luck... finally after much fruitless searching they end up in Paris. One evening while Louis is wandering through the dark Paris streets he finally meets another vampire, Armand (Antonio Banderas) leader of a gothic vampire coven. Armand and his followers run The Theatre Des Vampires where they mount plays that mock and parody mortals, even though it is the mortal bourgeoisie that make up its unsuspecting audience. This encounter has tragic consequences for the pair; Armand falls in love with Louis and has Claudia and her new vampire nanny killed so that he can have Louis to himself, but his plan backfires. Stricken with grief Louis takes bloody revenge on the vampire coven, destroying their corrupt and decadent way of life forever. It is now the late 20th Century and Louis has returned to America; and finds himself back in his old hometown of NewOrleans, he senses something in a dilapidated old building, enters and finds Lestat... alive but frail and scared, they talk all to briefly and then part ways again.<br /><br />This beautiful, melancholy and sad film is one of those rare movies that is almost as good as the novel it was based on, I only wish it had been a little longer. The movie remains for the most part faithful to the book, for after all it was Anne Rice who wrote the screenplay. Sure Louis in the books has dark hair; Lestat (who was originally meant to be played by Julian Sands) is six foot tall, and Armand is an eternal teenager... but these are only minor quibbles that don't mar the film. And if you have ever seen the pretty average Queen of the Dammed, the lack lustre sequel, then you will realize what a truly wonderful film Neil Jordan has crafted. This highly romantic film is for me the ultimate chickflick with its hunky three lead actors, I mean they are all so broodingly handsome! So if you enjoyed Interview with the Vampire; I strongly urge you to begin exploring Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles and New Tales of the Vampires, or even her Lives of the Mayfair Witches which is also set in the same parallel world of seductive vampires, ghosts and secret societies.

B000O76T90|5.0|If there's one thing that sort of bugs me about the whole action genre is that they are incredibly formulaic and a lot of times you can almost guess where everything is going to happen. Well, to be fair Die Hard doesn't try to re-invent the wheel although nowadays whenever an action movie comes out, it's usually billed as \\"Die Hard on a something\\". You may see everything coming but damned if it isn't fun anyways.    John McClane is a New York City cop visiting his wife on Christmas Eve in Los Angeles. The 2 aren't on the best of terms and he's meeting her at the office building where she works and decide how to spend Christmas. Of course no sooner does he arrive that a group of terrorists led by Hans Gruber take hostages and try to get into a vault. Luckily John avoided capture and has to figure out how to save the hostages as well as his own skin all by himself.    Granted as you can tell, it's probably not the most original plot but what it does with it is the key thing here as the film rarely slows down. I know it's cliche to say that \\"the film gets going and never stops till the end!\\" and there are some slower parts but there's a sense of tension running through the whole thing that makes more interesting and not just filler between the action scenes. It's really the editing that makes the film exciting since, like Speed, the film never gets sluggish.     And of course the big draw was Bruce Willis and it's funny that the actor was once best known as the guy on that Moonlighting show from the 80's yet we see him as an action star and it's not hard to see why. Physically fit yet with a sense of humor, McClane isn't some humorless guy who makes awful one-liners now and then (Steven Segal, Van Damme) that makes it easier to root for him. And of course no hero can be without a villain and who better than Alan Rickman, probably best known for either this role or as Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series. What makes these two work is that they don't seem like enemies who meet for one night but the interplay and battle of wits is what makes them stand out.    While the film feels \\"80's\\" a lot, it's still nonetheless an engaging movie for those who are finding the recent action films a little lacking.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|When I first watched the beginning of  \\"Enterprise\\" on television, I was at first rather dismayed. What is this musak? Where is the Star Trek title? And the jingoistic patriotism! It was soo unlike what has gone before, and not in an especially good way. Having said that; I have found the show itself thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining and as always with Star Trek optimistic and hopeful for a brighter and more tolerant future. With time I have become rather fond of Star Trek: Enterprise, the adventures of Captain Jonathan Archer and his brave, bold and daring crew.<br /><br />I do have some problem with Star Treks predictable and formulaic approach, such as; the name of a ship is nearly always Enterprise, why not the Endeavour or the Discovery? And surely it would have been a good gesture to all the devoted Star Trek fans around the world to have included a foreign actor or actress in the Enterprise cast, other than the usual Americans or Brits; an Australian, a European or an Indian for example? But an even more significant issue to me as a bisexual woman, I feel saddened that there hasn't yet been a character in any Star Trek series who is from a sexual or gender minority. While there have been a handful of episodes that subtly addressed queer issues they were few and far between, and yes, one such episode was included in Enterprise. But of all the shows on television Star Trek in particular had no excuse whatsoever to not tackle this issue head on, I mean The United Federation of Planets is meant to be cosmopolitan and diverse isn't it? Well I for one seriously doubt an enlightened organization such as this would exclude people solely based on their sexual orientation or gender identity; and feel that this topical issue should have been addressed by the makers of Star Trek if they wanted the franchise to remain relevant to a postmodern audience, oh well. I firmly believe that if Gene Roddenberry was still alive today the subject of a transgender, gay, lesbian or bi character being included somewhere in the Star Trek universe would have been breached in a positive, tasteful and embracing way many years ago. I also think that during season three Enterprise becomes a little too gung-ho and brash, and that this really isn't in keeping with the peaceable Star Trek ethos. But I do realize that Star Trek: Enterprise is set at the beginning of humanities true exploration of space; and that the crew does not yet have a Prime Directive to guide their actions, so they make many honest mistakes. I particularly felt that the Xindi threat in this series was a fairly direct criticism of the Bush Administrations handling of 911; in that in the end it's not brute force that solves the problem, but diplomacy and cooperation with moderate Xindi factions. With time The United Federation of Planets will be founded to bring many of the disparate and warring species of our quadrant of space together in a spirit of cooperation and mutual benefit, and in this sadly underrated series the Enterprise NX-01 crew will play a vital role in its eventual foundation. So despite these misgivings (which by the way are more concerned with the Star Trek franchise as a whole) I have absolutely loved watching Enterprise and have really looked forward to each new episode, throughout all four seasons.<br /><br />The scriptwriting and production design of Enterprise was, as with all Star Trek series, impeccable and tasteful; with thought provoking stories and close attention paid to the details of the sleekly stylish sets and props, to the moody and dramatic lighting and cool special effects, or the beautiful costumes and the look of the aliens. I also think that Enterprise had a grittier and more realistic take on the Trek universe than the other series, but of course, it is much closer in time to our era than the other series. The well chosen cast is made up of talented actors that keep you emotionally engaged; and make you care what happens to their respective characters, and little Porthos is soo adorable! All these elements combined make Enterprise addictive viewing, and are what set it apart from other television shows in this ever popular genre. So what a damn shame that it's been cancelled after only four short seasons, and all the more so, just as it was getting its space legs! I think that in an era when television is increasingly being dumbed down a show like Enterprise was actually needed more than ever; for it could at times be quite intelligent, and sometimes even extremely moving. So like many other trekkies I feel incredibly annoyed at the Paramount Executives for canceling Star Trek: Enterprise, and truly believe that they've made a rash error of judgement. I mean surely it would have been a wiser decision to let the show run its full course of seven seasons, and then, to have waited a while to see if there's still a market for a further Star Trek series?<br /><br />The sleek silver plastic casing that the DVDs come in is truly elegant and stylish, I just wish there had been three more of them! The special features are fantastic too, for with animated menus they provide hours of behind the scenes info and trivia that gives one a deeper appreciation of what goes into the making of a series like Enterprise. As fans we should thank the heavens for DVD so that the valiant but ill-fated Star Trek: Enterprise will at least be saved for posterity as a valuable and treasured part of the Star Trek canon. So if you consider yourself an avid trekkie I think Star Trek: Enterprise should definitely be on your wishlist if you plan to collect the various Trek series on DVD; as for the obsessive completist like myself, I would not have it otherwise!ttle Porthos is soo adorable!

B000002UCN|5.0|I bought this CD because of only one of the songs on it.  However, when I listened to the other songs, I really liked all of them. I realized that George was a great musician apart from the Beatles.  I plan to buy more of his CD's.
B00003CXCT|4.0|As three of my favorite movies growing up as a kid on the outskirts of Sydney in the conservative 1980s; these timelessly wonderful films were a truly welcome means of escape from the pressures of daily life, and I am glad to say that the classic Star Wars Trilogy is still great entertainment after all these years. Now they are finally available on DVD, cleaned up and restored to a stunning and pristine condition, one can at last enjoy them again and again. These quasi-mystical space opera's; replete with brave Jedi Knights, strange aliens and their many worlds, Androids, Starships and Light Sabers can now be experienced in all their epic glory. George Lucas in making these three groundbreaking films quite literally, forever changed the way Hollywood made its movies.<br /><br />Although now as a adult I can be very critical and expect much more from a movie than sheer spectacle; and while they are somewhat dated and the dialogue might seem a bit corny and naive in these very dark and troubled times, that's okay. The films also tend to be too simplistic, or black and white, but then most folklore or mythology is much the same, so that's okay as well. In spite of these minor criticisms I still thoroughly enjoy watching these three visionary films once in a blue moon. For I realize that when all is said and done, they are just swashbuckling intergalactic adventure stories not to be taken too earnestly! When I watch these films I experience a strong feeling of romantic nostalgia, as I guess many around my age do; those in their late 20s and 30s. There is a longing for a time when life seemed to be simpler and less complex; a time when people were more radical and nonconformist, a time when people were less jaded, selfish and cynical as they are now. And I don't actually have much of a problem with many of the changes George Lucas has made to his films; after all art history is full of artists who have gone back to change and redo a piece of art they've never been satisfied with, mainly in painting. It's just a shame that he hasn't made available on DVD the original theatrical release versions as well, for posterity, if not for fans. I was disappointed at the relatively small amount of special features included on these disks and think that's just cheap and stingy; especially considering how many studios put a lot more effort into the \\"extras\\" these days, George Lucas really had no excuse and could have added more... a gallery of concept art would have been great for example. Or featurettes on Ralph McQuarrie, who did so much to define the visual aesthetic of the films; and one on John Williams who wrote, composed and conducted the memorably rousing soundtracks for these wonderful movies. For I think it can be argued that these two highly creative artists have done almost as much as Mr. Lucas himself to establish the popularity and success of the Star Wars franchise.<br /><br />George Lucas was inspired by such diverse sources as the gripping serial adventures of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon; to romantic tales of Medieval Chivalry and the Japanese art of Bushido to ancient myths, legends and fairy tales. Old documentary footage from both World Wars I and II inspired him too; and early modern decorative art styles, such as Art Nouveau and Art Deco. He was also strongly influenced by legendary fellow filmmaker Akira Kurosawa (1910-1998) and the pop folklorist and writer Joseph Campbell (1904-1987) who worked as an advisor on the films. He deftly wove all these varied inspirations together to create an archetypal and mythic masterpiece of good and evil, heroes and villains, which taken as a thematic whole forms an aesthetically unified and prime example of science-fantasy in film. In doing so he has created a modernistic fable for the late 20th Century and beyond that has inspired generations of dreamers. May the force be with you!h, mainly in painting.

B0002JJBZY|4.0|What can I say about Star Trek: The Original Series that hasn't already been said, I'll try to keep it brief. Way back in the mid 1960s one man had a vision of how the future of humanity could possibly turn out, it was called Star Trek. Gene Roddenberry's secular humanist dream was of a Human Race that had outgrown racism, sexism, war and superstition. Humanity had conquered disease and poverty and had no need for money any longer; for the pursuit of greed and selfish goals had largely been replaced with a desire to better oneself, and expand ones horizons. With the discovery of warp technology, or faster than light travel, the Human Race ventured onto the galactic stage for the first time in its long and turbulent history. Aided by the Vulcans they would then develop a Starfleet, and in time go on to found The United Federation of Planets (based on The United Nations?) an ambitious organization that would forever change the face of the known universe.<br /><br />The characters of James T. Kirk, Mr Spock, Dr McCoy, Scotty and the other crew members of the USS Enterprise NCC-1701 are now pop culture icons. We join in their daring adventures \\"to go boldly where no man has gone before\\" on a five year mission of exploration. In the galactic voyages of the Enterprise we meet the Vulcans and Romulans, Klingons and Andorians amongst others for the first time. Some fans have pointed out inconsistencies with later series, for example the Klingons in The Original Series don't really look like... Klingons, and all sorts of wild theories have grown as to why modern Klingons look soo different. For a long time the producers of the various Star Trek series and movies had trouble explaining this discrepancy; but if one watches the prequel series Star Trek: Enterprise the Klingons have those characteristic armored cranial ridges, and in Enterprise it is also finally revealed why those of Kirk's era look like swarthy thick set Humans. Star Trek was made on a shoestring budget and the concept artists who worked on it had to constantly improvise, and would use almost anything they could get their hands on. The sets are bright and colourful as are the sometimes garish costumes; and the wonderful retro props like the Tricorder or the Communicator are big, functional and cool. When the aliens are made to look truly alien, such as the Gorn or Tribbles, the results are totally hilarious! Despite Star Treks lofty ideals it was very politically incorrect, and I must admit I find this refreshingly entertaining. It was made in an era when men were men, and the women wore revealing miniskirts, but at least in theory the sexes were considered equal. Captain Kirk is an outrageously chauvinistic womanizer who has ego problems and constant jibes are made about Mr Spock's Vulcan heritage by Dr McCoy; this witty onscreen chemistry between the lead trio is what gives the series much of its charm, and can at times be extremely funny indeed!<br /><br />While Gene Roddenberry's inspiringly optimistic vision of our future is on face value funky, fun and wonderfully camp, for its time it actually was quite a radical series that broke many conservative establishment taboos. It cleverly used the science-fiction genre as a vehicle for making pointed social commentary, critique and criticism of what were then extremely divisive issues. The Original Series also played its small part in the Civil Rights movement by including the character of Uhura, who was one of the first African American women to appear on television, it also included a Japanese American character named Sulu and a Russian character named Pavel Chekov. Considering that the brazen attack on Pearl Harbour during World War II was still fresh in many people's minds; and that Cold War paranoia was at its height, these were indeed brave decisions. Unfortunately Treks later incarnations didn't continue to push the envelope in much the same way by including characters who are openly gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. To this date there has been no convincing explanation why this particular minority group has been so completely excluded from the Star Trek universe; for I mean at its core Star Trek is supposed to be all about celebrating difference and diversity, almost as much as its about portraying a wonderful and bright future for humanity in the stars. The three DVD boxes that The Original Series come in are brilliantly designed, very groovy and colourful just like the series; being yellow, blue and red. The series have been given a basic digital remastering and the picture beautifully cleared up, so one can watch them again and again. The special features are also quite extensive and will provide many hours of in depth enjoyment, and there are even quite alot of hidden \\"easter eggs\\" too! So if like me you are an avid trekkie, and have only ever seen the later Trek series; then do yourself a big favour and buy Star Trek: The Original Series, for you'll undoubtedly find them most rewarding. Live long & prosper!sgender.

B000PMGNK4|3.0|I don't know if any of you have a similar issue but at the start of chapter 15 there is a 2 second layer pause on mine. My player has memory buffers to greatly reduce the time for a transition and I don't have this long of one on  any other DVDs I own. Any way the movie itself is terrific with a great job by the dub team at Bandai. Thats why I give the movie itself a 5 and the DVD a 2 cause of the annoying pause in chapter 15. For a an average 3 stars.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I had been told about V for Vendetta by friends who had seen it and  said that it was an absolutely amazing movie. It took me awhile to get around to watching this film, but  when I finally saw it on DVD I was quite stunned. How on earth did it ever get made? How did it get past the censors? For V for Vendetta is like an anarchist manifesto! I know it was loosely based on a controversial English graphic novel; and that its creators didn't like this film version much at all, although I don't really know why. The Wachowski's should be congratulated for bringing this timely film to the silver screen as I think it is most relevant in todays climate of increasing religious fundamentalism, extremism and intolerance. The film is set in a bleakly dystopian UK of the near future whose populace lives in constant fear of the oppressive Christo-Fascist dictatorship called Norsefire (based on the National Front) run by a demented Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) who though reclusive, rules with an iron fist. The regime deports so called foreigners, black bags intellectuals, artists, sexual minorities and anyone who presumably steps out of line. The story of the film follows one Evey Hammond (Natalie  Portman) who is out late one night and is accosted by some secret policemen called \\"fingermen\\" who intend to rape her. She is saved at the last moment by a mysterious masked vigilante named V (Hugo Weaving) who takes her to his lair... but only after blowing up the Old Bailey first!<br /><br />V is the tortured and obsessive antihero of the film that over time opens up Evey's mind to the horrors that are going on around her unquestioned and unchallenged by anyone, and this is where the story really begins. V has a personal grudge against the Norsefire regime and he is the only one brave enough to stand up to them; and certainly does so with great panache, style and flair! V is a freedom fighter, and not a terrorist like some have claimed, for he is primarily fighting for the rights of the downtrodden people and not some twisted and reactionary political or religious dogma. Throughout the movie V and Evey are under investigation by the police, and it's a race against time for him to accomplish his goal of toppling the corrupt Norsefire regime. One of the chief reasons I appreciate this film is for its compassionately positive portrayal of its gay and lesbian characters; for I think that many fundamentalist leaders today (of most religious persuasions) would truly love to marginalize, persecute and vilify sexual and gender minorities in the same way that Norsefire does, though only if they got their way of course.<br /><br />V for Vendetta the film may not be as good as the graphic novel, but then, film versions of books rarely are. Doubtless Hollywood has filtered out some of the more explicit political and drug references, but the anarchist message still comes across loud and clear. So if I were the author I wouldn't be too upset for sales of the original graphic novel have gone up, and most importantly, people are slowly becoming more politically aware and socially conscious. This is an important movie that openly questions where Western culture is heading; the christian right is gaining power, the separation of church and state is constantly being challenged, many of our basic democratic freedoms and civil liberties are being eroded and big business is creating a bland intellectual, cultural and ecological wasteland. So if humanity doesn't start to grow up as soon as possible, then I fear the world we live in has no future. Viva la revolution!<br /><br />* On a more historical note the character of V takes his inspiration from Guy Fawkes (1570-1606) the British Catholic revolutionary who fought against religious oppression, and who attempted to blow up the Houses of Parliament! =Sntrodden people and not some twisted and reactionary political or religious dogma.

0062502182|5.0|I LOVED this book. Its simplicity is not something you usually see in writing, and the message is one that has been cherished for all ages.     In short: If you dwell in the status quo all your life, you will get nowhere. Follow your dreams (literally)!    A must-read for everyone!
B000NVIXDW|4.0|This is one of the best releases in his growing catalogue of jazz/pop recordings. He's still proping himself up with his Sinatra wantabe interpretations; which is a shame because his voice is strong enough to develop his own material and style. This is a pleasant compilation of songs with a little \\"salsa\\" flavor. Easy on the ears and great for dancing.
B00000F14B|4.0|Meredith Wilson was responsible for some great music but he manages here to paint a beautiful picture of early 1900, Small Town America.  He does this by skillful blending of dialect, story and, of course music that allows one to overlook  a very improbable story line.        To an extent the production is stylized such that only Robert Preston could make the lead character believable.  However, he had already lost much of the vitality the role required when the movie was made.  And that is the productions weak point. The actors are clearly acting to support the interludes between the music.  But the music is what makes the man.
0316067598|5.0|Every American should read \\"Lone Survivor\\" so that they can hear the incredible story of some of our nation's best and bravest soldiers. Maybe if that were to happen some people would realize what it really takes to fight this war as well as give them a reason to support the great men who are putting their lives on the line fighting it while the great majority of us are safe back home in the United States. The book is well written with a personal side that many books of this genre don't have.  After reading this book i will never forget the men of SDV Team 1 and Seal Team 10 HOOYAH!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|\\"Zodiac\\" is a film about one of the famous serial killers, directed by David Fincher who had previously given us \\"Se7en.\\" You may think Fincher's latest film is made in the same vein as Brad Pitt's hit thriller with his trademark camerawork, but \\"Zodiac\\" is actually more like fact-based, dialogue-driven thrillers of the 1970s such as \\"All the President's Men.\\"     But of course \\"Zodiac\\" is about the notorious killer (which, it is said, inspired the first \\"Dirty Harry\\" film) and it starts with the brutal killing of a young couple in a car. The film includes more than one murder scenes and they are all very scary, or suspenseful at least, but the scare comes from the matter-of-factness of the killer and that of the director, who, instead of gores, opted for the minute descriptions of each case with a surprisingly subdued touch.    The film suggests one theory about the identity of the murderer, but Fincher's intention is not clearly to solve this still mysterious case, so please don't demand what you cannot get here, something like sense of closure. He is more interested in the process in which some people were involved in, and attracted to this unusual case, someone like cartooninst-turned-writer Robert Graysmith (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), whose obsession drives him to what he believes is true. And the film is wonderful in showing the credible portraits of the police detectives and the complicated police procedures that are often frustrating.    The film is very long (running time about 160 minutes) and its latter half drags a little, which is probably an inevitable thing, considering what happened, or didn't happen, in the real life. But still \\"Zodiac\\" is a suspenseful crime drama that keeps fascinating us throughout with its intelligence and details.

B000EHSVS2|5.0|This movie only gets better with age and, apparently, with re-mastering. What a beautifully done film. Everything from George C. Scott's portray of an extremely complex man, to the soundtrack, and epic scenery contribute to one of the most complete film's of the last forty years. Add Karl Malden's equally superlative performance as Omar Bradley and what you have is one of the most complete and evocative biographical sketches ever to grace celulloid.
1594489505|5.0|This was a wonderful book, better, I think, than \\"Kite Runner.\\" Although the author is a man, he has been able to write convincingly about the two women characters in the book. It is set almost entirely in Afghanistan, which keeps the focus on the situation there, under the Soviets, the warlords, the Taliban, and finally the Americans. It is brutal in places, very sad, but with a very satisfying ending.
B000H5U65C|4.0|I have only heard of these guys but never actually heard them until I bought this album. As soon as the first song started, I go \\"Oh crap, not another hardcore band.\\" I just don't like that shouting singing style, at least done with such good music. There are other places the vocals are not so bad. Sometimes they kind of touch on the \\"alternative\\" vibe which I don't like either, but in other places not so much.<br /><br />What I really like is the varied music. It is quite interesting with lots of twists and turns. I read another review where the guy says the band basically cut and pasted this album together in the studio. Maybe so, but they did a pretty good job of it. They are all competent musicians and if I was not mistaken, I actually heard a decent guitar solo in there! It seems many of the new bands are anti-guitar solo but these guys don't shy away from it. Kudos for that.<br /><br />This is adventurous metal and I really like it, all except for the vocals. Recommended.
B000O599XK|5.0|I have european and american prior releases.  Cut.  First the full image that I have on VHS from TV, is cut on dvds by two bars top and bottom to get a 1:85 image ratio, as Warner says \\"as shown first in theaters\\".  But since, Warner, Tv offered the full image version for all those who missed the initial release !, and you seem to ignore that remote control allows dvd player or large screen tv to enlarge the image for those who chose it.  Still planning to gain money one day releasing the \\"full image\\" version, uh ? (as for the Hammer films)  Second, I saw the movie in the 50s in Paris, and at origin, and still in mid-70s in Paris in the original subtitled version in theaters (full screen), because Walter Brennan asks him to keep his promise, Dean Martin washes himself in a bucket in the prison with the others around.  It is WHY he changes his dirty clothes for clean ones, BEFORE he announces going to the hotel for a bath (to finish details of course).    Is this still cut ?

This is pure rock and it is as accessible as the music of AC/DC.

0767020308|2.0|Kate Beckinsale's performance, to me, seemed extremely one dimensional. We certainly see the vanity, but none of the compassion which makes Emma a worthy (albeit immature) hero traveling along her arc. By comparison, Gwenyth Paltrow's performance (within a year) shows us a misguided socialite, who repeatedly displays compassion.     The best example might concern Emma's view of Martin. While Paltrow tells us he is beneath her, she also points out that were he less fortunate (than he is), she would feel honor bound  to help him. Kate's Emma, on the other hand, simply despise him for no good reason.     Having watched both features back to back, Beckinsale strike's me as a twin sister of Mrs. Elton, rather than Austin's kind-hearted, but misguided Emma.     I would recommend forgoing this version and taking Paltrow's instead.
1594489505|5.0|I thought the Kite Runner was an excellent book, but this book definitely solidified Khaled Hosseini's place in the literary world.   A remarkable and powerful tale of two very different women from diffent pasts whose paths eventually cross.  I could not put this book down.  It was moving from start to finish - It will definitely give you a greater appreciation of women's rights and for what we have in our country.  A must read!
B000QUCNP4|4.0|On just this movie alone, I would have to rate it, without a doubt, 5 stars.<br /><br />Being a teenager and growing up in San Francisco in the early 1970's, it was hard to NOT pay attention to the news about the Zodiac and the fear that spread throughout my neighborhood. Everyone who even resembled that sketch of him was suspect in our eyes.<br /><br />Zodiac does a great job of placing you right into the 70's. Just listen to the radio that is playing in the car at the beginning of the movie. Real sounds from Bay Area top 40 radio giants KFRC & KYA. So many things were done right with the period.<br /><br />Knowing the story already, I can remember leaving the theater saying to myself, \\"Robert Downey Jr, was awesome.\\" I don't think I've seen a better performance from an American actor since Sean Penn in \\"I Am Sam\\" a few years back.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is awesome and people who discredit the movie for leaving you hanging at the end....well, any of us who've lived around the areas where the Zodiac terrorized, have been hanging on for an ending to this story since the day it all started. I hope the people who complained didn't expect a Hollywood ending. I guess it just shows the mentality and attention span of our society. But, to each his/her own.<br /><br />About the DVD release...I'm NOT going to be buying it. Even a simple commentary track would have convinced me to buy this release. I guess these video companies are catching on to our habits....people will buy even without the expense of extras. This is a film that most people will probably rent, but I'm sure that there will be a \\"Special Edition\\" sometime in the future. I'll wait or I just may lose my interest by that time.
1594489505|5.0|Although a disturbing novel it captures the essence of a war torn country and the pain suffered by those at the mercy of such a war.  Hosseini at times gives discriptive detail which almost makes it hard to read on.  He also gives a sense of a whole other world experienced by those less fortunate than people living in the western world.
1594489505|5.0|Absoloutely fantastic. Can't even be compared to The Kite Runner--which I thought was amazing at the time too! This book reads fast (It's the most incredible page-turner yet!). Hosseini makes you feel as if you are there, in the house, street, wherever with the characters. The only problem with the book is that it ends! I'm craving more---I hope he has a third book coming out soon!

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is a remarkable fete owed in particular to the brave filming crew.  If you've seen this in High Definition, which I had, and get this set thinking it will be as vivid as HD, it won't be.  It is still worth the investment to have until HD DVD becomes more prevalent.  But the sad thing about this series for me is that it shows us how truly violent the planet upon which we roam is.  If you can ignore the intermittent episodes of preditor kills, you will be overcome by the vastly breath-taking beauty of this planet we call Earth.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|This is IT.<br />This is where, in retrospect, it all started. I didn't realize it at the time but I do now. There were two sixties, the early 60-64, Beach Boys, Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, early Beatle &#34;I Want to Hold you Hand&#34;, crew-cut, clean-cut, A-line dress, beehive hair, Bass Weejun, khaki, American Graffiti sixties, and the other sixties, the Revolver, Sgt Pepper, Jimi Hendrix, Steppenwolf, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, United States of America, hippy sixties that everyone today thinks was the sixties, happened AFTER 1965. And it all started with this album!<br /><br />Bob Dylan, the antiwar, civil-rights, Woody Guthrie-imitating darling of the folksingers, the Voice and Conscience of his Generation, after penning &#34;Blowin in the Wind&#34;, and &#34;The Masters of War&#34;, stunned his purist followers with &#34;Bringing it All Back Home&#34;. Electric instruments and a turn from trying to change the world by preaching at it to a bemused surreal satire. This, and &#34;Revolver&#34; are the two most influential albums of the sixties, maybe of music history. I remember.<br /><br />The Beatles were wildly popular with younger listeners, but generally dismissed by music critics of the time as being a wildly sucessful but totally Pop phenominon. Dylan said they were &#34;Bubblegum&#34;. Dylan's friend Al Aronowitz (sp?), said that the Beatles weren't that bad. Dylan and friend were introduced to the Beatles at a certain party in Manhattan AUG 64, whereat someone offered Lennon his first smoke. Lennon &#34;took a drink from Dr Robert's special cup&#34;. Dylan and Lennon talked and found they had a lot in common. Dylan suggested Lennon should put more of his feelings into his songs. Following this party, the Beatles became much better, more introspective, and a few months later &#34;Rubber Soul&#34; and &#34;Revolver'!.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|For lots of fans this album is considered \\"the best\\" of King Crimson. Although I am a little cautious while calling \\"the best\\"; something for sure, this is the most authentic progressive rock music. You can taste the most original progressive rock embodied in rhythm, form, harmony, and melody. That is unbelievable that the album was released in 1974 (Let me double check!). Let's give them five stars as they paved the way for the bands that day by day, elevate the concept of creativity in rock music: Dream Theater, Porcupine Tree, Spock's beard, The Flower Kings, Tool, and...
0753820250|5.0|This book is masterful. Zafon's storytelling capability and prose are truly remarkable, and he has created characters that are so compelling and multi dimensional, you feel as though they can just walk off the pages and into your daily life. This is more than just \\"a book about a book\\". It's about Barcelona after WWII, it's about the childhood and adulthood of a boy as well as his father and friends, it's about the souls of the people in this neighborhood and their family history, and it's about heartwrenching pain and unbelievable happiness. The book is dark, yet, there's an undercurrent of humor that will make you laugh out loud in some places. You can't characterize it as just a mystery or a romance or an adventure or an historical novel, because it's all of these wrapped into one, beautifully written package. This book is truly an emotional rollercoaster that will grab you from the very first page and not let you go until the last word.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|A msterprice by Tornatorre and Morricone! The critical acclaim is fully deserved - the performances are strong (particularly that of Philippe Noiret in what is one of his best roles), the music is wonderful, the cinematography memorable.<br /><br />Yes, the film is ostensibly about the role that movies play in our lives, but in reality Tornatorre is using the \\"cinema\\" as another one of his vehicles (as the ship in \\"The Legend of 1900\\") through which he tells us the important story of how important and charater-forming our early friendships, loves, fascinations and disappointments are. As the years are going by, the main character has all grown up, but part of the little boy is still alive insde and it does not take much for the memories to flood the silver screen accompanied with the poignant Morricone music.<br /><br />This movie is a gem for those who like Tornatorre, Italian cinema and a \\"must see\\" for all seirous movie fans!
B000P2A24W|5.0|First, Bon Jovi is the hardest working band in show business; with their many tours around the world and many albums.  So if they want to try a different route artistically, it is their prerogative and NO ONE has any right to criticize.    That being said, Bon Jovi did try a different route with this album.  So anyone that prefers to only hear a hard rocking Bon Jovi, then do not buy this album is all.  I would not call this a country album.  When Bon Jovi calls it \\"Nashville influenced\\" I think they mainly mean the songs tried to tell a story, like most country songs do.  The songs are slower paced, but I really do not sense a country sound.  Just a slowed down Bon Jovi, telling stories with songs.  Pretty cool.    My favorite is \\"(You Want To) Make A Memory.\\"  The first single and just an amazing ballad.  I could listen to it over and over.  My second favorite is \\"Seat Next To You\\" which is also a great ballad.  The duet with LeAnn Rhymes, \\"Till We Ain't Strangers Anymore,\\" is very good.  She has such a great voice and it goes well with Jon's voice.  I would not call it a great ballad, but still very good.  I actually did not really like the duet with Big & Rich, \\"We Got It Going On.\\"  It is a more up tempo, slightly rocking, fun song.  So many may like it, but it just did not appeal to me.  \\"Everybody's Broken\\" has great lyrics and is another great listening ballad.  The other songs I would classify as nice listening.  So if you want to get an album where you kick back, relax, and just enjoy some somewhat slower paced songs with meaningful lyrics, get this album.
B000066744|5.0|I feel that many of the reviews here do not get Tornatorrwe. To appreciate this fabulous Italian director is to understand that the plot does not really matter in and of itself. The plot here is simle, if unusual, a boy who is a musical genuis - born and living his whole life on a transatlantic liner in the golden age of translatlantic voyages.<br /><br />Those looking for a \\"period drama\\" will be disappointed here. This movie, like many of Tornatorre's films, is a journey through time and human experiences. The film is interlaced with retrospectives back and forth through time, weaved on a canvas of beautiful images - such is the picture of fascinated passangers arriving in America when they see the statue of Liverty or the main character playing a piano which is \\"dancing\\" in the ballroom of a ship.<br /><br />This movie is a rich poetic and artistic exerience for those who are willing to take the journey. The music of Enio Morricone is wanderful, the performances are impressive and the experience memorable.<br /><br />Gen on the ship and enjoy the journey!<br /><br />p.s. for those who like the movie, I recommend other Tornatorre/Moricone features, such as \\"Malena\\" and, of course \\"Cinema Paradiso\\"
B000HEWEDK|5.0|very well re mastered; beautiful colors and a good audio; the story is for me the best: a cult movie
006056251X|4.0|This book is very entertaining...but the hero seems very like Derek Craven from \\"Dreaming of You\\", not that I'm complaining because is one of my favorite characters of all time! So I still thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B000001F5F|5.0|I wore the vinyl out in college so I replaced it with a CD copy a couple of years back. I just listened to it and I believe the audio CD is missing a portion from \\"Electric Co.\\" There's a slow breakdown in the middle of the song - I could swear that my vinyl contained a part where Bono is adlibbing \\"Send in the Clowns\\". There's a clumsy edit on the CD on this part (it's very abrupt) which leads me to believe my memory isn't as bad as I rhought. Anyone else with this memory?

B000068IEU|1.0|If you can watch this film and find it entertaining, then you might want to consider therapy. I don't know how anyone could be entertained by watching rape, torture, and humiliation no matter how much comical music and dumb jokes are added to break the tension.  I just don't think we should be making films like this when there are `people' who get ideas out there.      The quality of the film is awful and the acting really is bad.  This is the second worst movie I ever bought ..\\"Alien 3000\\" was the first.
0142501123|5.0|This is one of my favorite halloween books to read to my class. The children are captivated by the rhyming text as well as the illustrations. After the first reading, they chant together \\"the witch tapped her broomstick, and whoosh, they were gone!\\". They giggle as each additional friend hops on the broom, wondering just how many will fit on it. At the climax of the story, they meet a scary dragon (just the right spookiness for preschoolers) and all of the friends pitch in to help save their witch. And finally, just when you think all of the fun is over, the witch casts a spell to make a \\"truly magnificent ...\\"(you have to read it yourself to find out how it ends)
B000FVQYYK|4.0|Absoltuion in my opinion is the most perfect album ever made.  Not because it's my favorite, but the songs shift perfectly as if to form a soundtrack to an dramatically epic movie.    Black Holes unfortunately has too many lacking songs.  The majority of the album is mediocre and not really catchy, however its key tracks are the best muse has ever made.  First of all, \\"Starlight\\" is their first attempt at an uplifting track the end result is honestly the best song i have ever heard.  I swear i've been trying for a year and i can't get sick of it.      \\"Map of the Problematique\\" is also better than any other song muse has recorded.  It's fast yet haunting in the most sinister way.  This song grips me in a way i cant ignore.  It continues to get more and more eerie as the song goes on, without letting the beat get stale.  I just can never stop raving about this song, i think it's gorgeous and one of the best songs ever written.  The only reason i like starlight more is because i'm just not depressed enough for this song 24/7.    \\"City of Delusion\\" and \\"Knights of Cydonnia\\" are also very catchy tracks that i listen to regularly.  They allow muse to tap into a downing rock that isnt dark enough to enter a state of overdramatic.  This is how they broke away from Absolution. Other than that the rest of the album is kind of a wash.  It wont bore you, but you wont be placing them on repeat.    If nothing else, download \\"starlgiht\\" and \\"Map of the Problematique.\\"  These 2 tracks are arguably muse's finest and must be admired.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I cannot praise this BBC series highly enough.  If you missed it on television -- or even if you didn't -- this set will expand your knowledge about those beings with whom we share this planet.  The series is divided by habitat, and while there are some discussions of weather and flora, it really concentrates on things that have eyes (well, except for the episode entitled \\"Caves\\", where some of the creatures that live in total darkness are eyeless).  The photography is breathtaking, and the 10-minute piece at the end of each episode that tells about how it was photographed makes it even more impressive.  This series is an astounding achievement.

B000M341QE|5.0|Martin Scorsese's lifelong journey to winning his first Oscar ended with this thrilling police drama, \\"The Departed\\".  Based on the movie, \\"Infernal Affairs\\", Scorsese brings us back to the days when he first burst on the scene as an upstart director with films such as, \\"Mean Streets\\" & \\"Who's That Knocking On My Door?\\".  The cast here is top notch, lead by multiple Oscar winner Jack Nicholson who is brilliant as mob boss, Jack Costello.  It's hard to imagine how Nicholson couldn't have been nominated for his role.  He's charming, funny and disturbing.  Other outstanding performances were by Leonardo DeCaprio, Matt Damon, Mark Walhberg.  Watching this film reminds me of the work of Alfred Hitchcock.  In his films, (i.e. \\"Strangers on a Train \\"Psycho\\" & \\"Saboteur\\") Hitchcock lets his audience know who the antagonist is on purpose and the audience is enthralled about how the perpetrator will be caught.  The film's writer, William Monahan (with the help of Hong Kong original writers) keeps us guessing on what will happen and it works ever so effectively.  This is a film that is volent as Scorsese can make it and though not his best film, is worthy of Oscar's top prize. Congratulations, Martin!
B000OVLBEO|2.0|When I saw the trailer for Ghost Rider I thought it was going to be a good movie but I was wrong. Ghost Rider was so poorly put together. There weren't any good or fun action scenes to enjoy and the acting wasn't really great. The effects are good and Ghost Rider looks great but the movie is only enjoyable for 8 year olds. If they make Ghost Rider 2 I will still check it out but hope it's better than the last one.
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Here Burton goes again remaking a classic.  What's with that?  In my opinion, he's overrated as a director.  Why can't he and his team come up with anything original?  Johnny Depp gives a great performance as usual though.  Unfortunately, that's probably the only reason to see it.  It just doesn't come even remotely close to the classic from 1971 - Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.  In C&TCF, the Oompa Loompas are played by one guy wearing a red jumpsuit.  The Oompa Loompas were much much better in the earlier version WW&TCF.  And painted a much different image for the viewer.  They had orange skin and green hair and had the charm and charisma lacking in this later version of the story.  I chuckled a couple times though, so I'm giving it 3 stars.

055358202X|2.0|I love this story and the characters in it but it has become so complex that I can't keep track of all of the peripheral characters. Especially when they are referred to by their first name or their last name or their title or their nickname, all in one paragraph.     With such long lag times between books it is impossible to remember all of the minutiae that Martin packs into his stories. He should give his readers a break and let the editors do their jobs. Wait for the next one to come out before you read this one.

0823016714|4.0|I think it's the only book right now which has addressed reference material for facial expressions. It's really useful, but professionals may get disappointed with the quality of some pictures and blurriness. It's not that all pictures are bad quality, but when you have such an amazing reference you ought to expect a lot and that's where this book is disappointing. But for sure this book will be useful for all beginners and probably higher level artists. For this price don't hesitate to buy if you really want a reference for facial expressions. Some people may not like the quality of the paper, but I think you should also consider the price.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|Jeremy Issacs has won all sorts of recognition for this series, and all the plaudits are well deserved.  This is by far the most compelling work on World War Two and is well worth adding to your collection.  Sir Laurence Olivier's narration coupled with archival footage and crude (remember it's the 1970's) but effective graphics make this a great primer  on the most destructive war in history.    While the overall series is excellent, some notable highlights include:    * The opening three minutes of episode one, an incredible piece of filmmaking.  * 'France Falls' does an excellent job of showing how France was beaten long before the first shot was fired.  * 'Banzai: Japan Strikes' does an exceptioanlly good job of explaining why Japan took increasingly agressive action in Asisa throughout the 30s.  Plus offers excellent insight into what Japan hoped to accomplsih with its attack on Pearl Harbor.  * 'Stalingrad' captures the brutality of the most brutal battle of WWII  * 'Whirlwind' explains how military leaders struggled to understand the application of an entirely new way of war, strategic bombing.  * 'Nemisis' brilliantly catalogues the final days of the Thousand Year Reich.    Some puzzling weaknesses are:    * The overall British point of view.  Issacs produced this for an English television audience. I believe if Issacs knew beforehand the worldwide audience he would eventually reach, he would have made a more balanced series giving the Americans more due.  * The episode 'It's A Lovely Day Tomorrow: Burma'.  There is no reason to devote a whole episode to a side-show of the war.    * Overall sketchy coverage of the Pacific war.  Burma gets a full hour, but the battle of Midway gets 10 minutes. Guadalcanal gets less than that.    * 'Wolfpack' tries to explain submarine warfare, but once again leaves out action in the Pacific where submarines played an even bigger part than in the Atlantic.      I've watched these episodes multiple times.  Even with some of the weaknesses, it's always compelling veiwing.  A true monumnet to documentary filmaking!
B000P2A24W|5.0|This CD is a little different than the others I have purchased by Bon Jovi, but nonetheless I love it!  The songs are great and have good lyrics that tell stories just like you would expect from Bon Jovi.  The song with Big & Rich is really hoppin'!
0060594896|5.0|I'm by no means new to the whole Law Of Attraction concepts that has a new revival, thanks to the book and DVD The Secret---after seeing the DVD, I made note of the authors, philosophers, entreprenuers, etc who participated in the DVD--and of course, Jack Canfield was among them.  I'm still reading this book, and it's one I plan to re-read over and over again.  I am now embarking on a new journey of understanding the Law of Attraction, and this is a must get book to have for anyone who also wants to embark on a journey of better understanding of oneself in the scheme of things--and of course..to become successful.
B000EXZI1O|4.0|I am a huge Bee Gees fan but, this cd didn't have all of the songs that the album has that opens from a tri-fold.  The album which opens with a picture of each Bee Gee seemed to have a whole lot more songs. I can't believe that I am giving them 4 stars.  If it were identical to the album I would have given them 5 stars.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae is a great soulful new Artist. Her music is something unique. Her soulful voice and her lovely accent will have you listening to the c.d. over and over finding a new song you love everytime.  Breathless, Til it happens to you, and Like a Star are some of the best songs on her album but the other songs are just as great these are just a few  of my favorites.
B000301YY8|5.0|I love this cd!   I understand that sometimes profanity is the only way to truly express how you feel but, I wouldn't listen to it with my grandchild for fear that he may learn some not so choice words.
1590861515|5.0|Tapes were very good, but it helped to have seen the video to REALLY understand it all
B000B7QCKO|5.0|I have to say this is Yanni's greatest.  I really liked Ethnicity but this one has more drive.  You can tell when you listen to this cd that he has wanted to do this his whole life.  He definately wanted to make Greece proud.  And in this cd he did!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|1) Many of the tracks are very quiet.  They sound good with headphones but not when listening otherwise.<br />2) Why on earth are they out of order??!  I listen to a soundtrack both for the music and to be taken back through the movie.  It's jarring to be taken back out of order.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I haven't heard a cd of his I didn't like.  I just love the way his music makes me feel when I listen to it.  I listen to it at the end of the work day and all my stresses seem to melt away.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is music that touches the soul. Sea Change is a masterpiece. It is not a typical quirky beck album (which I love), but a more serious and focused version of Mutations taken to the 100th degree of excellence. This is Beck's finest album as a single work of art bar none. Beck pours himself into this album and bares himself for all the world to see. And anyone who hears it will be the better for it. Oh yeah, and we find out that Beck can really sing when he wants to.
B000001FE0|5.0|Any true Bee Gees fan and collector wouldn't be caught without this one.  Their music in this one has an up tempo.
1594489505|5.0|Wonderfully written story of the destruction of an ancient culture using modern weapons. Truly frightening telling of the abuse of women in a male dominant society.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is truly hillarious and deep.  This show hits every emotion.  This show makes you smile/laugh, get angry, worried, embarrased and sadden.  The characters are alive and have their unique personality.  Barney and Ted are interesting characters.  I can't wait to purchase season two.  I show everyone my season-one and right away they become fans.
B00069L0XG|5.0|Great Movies, I can't wait to see the latest one!!  Really nice packaging too.
1594489505|2.0|By my life I cannot understand the appeal of this author. He scatters metaphors around and they rarely stick to anything substantive. The story is interesting but moves too slowly considering there is not much to the slowness itself. perhaps redeemed slightly for its historical stuff? overall this book is a disaster and I could barely get thought it.
B000001F29|4.0|Probably still available for the unforgettable title track, the real gem on here is \\"State of Independence\\", with vocals as good as any Jon every did for Yes.  Plus three more Yes-worthy efforts, and really, not a bad track on the album.  Worthwhile!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I ran across this game from a games dealer at a homeschooling convention. It looked like a good game, so I bought it. And I am so glad I did! My kids love it, I love it, everyone who tries it loves it. I took it to my brother's birthday party to let people play, and hooked every adult in the room on it.<br /><br />Simple rules, but endless strategy and fun.<br /><br />Buy it here on Amazon-- I paid $[...] more for it from the games dealer.
B000687M48|4.0|Top-notch for a live album, not intoxicated and the sound quality is pretty good.  Three songs not on \\"Fallen\\"!  \\"Thoughtless\\" is as good as any single \\"Fallen\\" track, and the live concert footage on the DVD actually excited jaded 40-something me.  Plus VH1/MTV videos, which some of us have never outgrown.      My highest recommendation is to buy all three Evanescence albums to date.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|i always heard people talking about how great that one band, \\"my chemical romance\\" was, but i never really cared. so i heard the song \\"famous last words\\" on the radio, and i was like, \\"who is this?\\" my friend told me it was mcr and i was like, \\"whoa, they're better than i thought they were!\\" i went on itunes and wasted a bunch of money downloading songs from this album like crazy. my personal favorites (in order) are \\"the sharpest lives\\", \\"teenagers\\", \\"dead!', \\"house of wolves\\", \\"famous last words\\", \\"mama\\", and \\"welcome to the black parade\\". anyway, this cd is really worth buying, and you should check out their other stuff, too.
B000089RVX|4.0|What you hope for if you've ever heard \\"Bring Me to Life\\", it delivers more of same from start to finish.  However, clearly one-upped by nearly every track on \\"The Open Door\\".
B00099BPP6|5.0|I absolutely love this recording.  I used to own the LP, paid top dollar for an import CD awhile back, and am happy to see it now available at a very nice price.    I guess some people hear what they want to hear.  Say \\"Fischer-Dieskau as Rigoletto\\" and the initial reaction might be \\"huh?\\"  But listen to what the man does.  Verdi wrote for high baritone, and Fischer-Dieskau's tenorish quality fits the music perfectly.  His tender moments, and there are quite a few in this opera, are meltingly sweet and heart breaking.  And don't tell me he doesn't have enough power and bite for \\"Cortigiani\\"!  Others may prefer Merrill, or Milnes, or some more typical Verdi baritone.  To me, compared with Fischer-Dieskau's beautifully sung, magnificently acted and nuanced performances, those other guys just sound monochromatic, ballsy and boring.    And say \\"Scotto\\" and people think of the edgy, shrill, hammy and over-the-top persona she adopted later on.  Here she's just radiant, and lovely, with impeccable intonation and pinpoint accuracy.  This and her Lucia are fabulous, immensely enjoyable performances.    Bergonzi is the paragon everyone says he is.  Who would you rather hear as the Duke?  Kraus, maybe, but he's saddled with a clunky conductor.  The supporting cast on these CDs is equally fine.    The real star is Kubelik.  Who'd a thunk it?  But this, the earliest of Verdi's operas to have a symphonic, through-composed character (as opposed to being merely a succession of numbers) receives a powerful, dynamic reading here that is unmatched for color, flexibility and drama.  Like the best recorded performances (Monteux' Traviata, Serafin's Ballo) everything here is just as it should be.    A great, great recording.  Don't miss it.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|The very best album in my rather extensive Rock collection, which goes back as far as Cream.  Nothing less than outstanding from first note to last, it just goes to show that some of the best music every made is being produced today (albeit in smaller quantities than the '70's).    Strongly recommend buying all three Evanescence albums to date!  With original albums like these, no need for a \\"Best of\\" compilation.
B000P0J02E|5.0|I love his music. And all the movie soundtracks he has done. I already have two of these,one for my car,and one for my home. This purchase was for my best friend on her birthday. His music for soundtracks,always intenses and blends so well with the movie,which it is all about. He's a wonderful composer.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Because Linkin' Park left them in the dust. Sure, we have Given Up, No More Sorrow, and the infectious Bleed it Out here, but since Linkin' Park found a totally different way to convey their feelings besides screaming, all the angry fans that once liked them have no place to go. And, it's come to this. They have to blame Linkin' Park for moving on to a different sound. They couldn't handle the new sound. And, it's a shame. Because, no matter what, Linkin' Park delivers quality music. And, I wouldn't want them to turn into the generic materialistic rappers who rap about the same, and quite a few of people are now getting tired of them. I'd rather want what they deliver here. Just know, if you say that this album totally sucks, you're saying that Chester & Mike's feelings suck. You're saying that the Katrina victims suck. You're saying that the talents of the members of Linkin' Park suck. But, we all know that this band is wonderful. I don't know about the rest of the downers, but I'm moving on with Linkin' Park to their new sound. And, it doesn't have to be an evolution, it doesn't have to be an upgrade. It's just a new sound, coupled with some more in-depth lyrics. Sad that their earlier fans can't get that. Either way, just know that if you get this album, you will be hearing something much different. And, it's a host of good songs, along with a bit of profound thoughts & political biases (yes, politics). Linkin' Park has done a good job with this album, and don't be offended by my review, it's just my opinion. I just think that Linkin' Park has done a fantastic job with their album, from the Wake, all the way to their tribute at the end. It's good.
B000OPOANE|5.0|Though I had to wait for this MVI, I have to say that it was worth it.  The mix is obviously different from the CD, but not experimentally so which is good.  With a couple of notable exceptions, the 5.1 mix sounds like a mix might sound in concert.  For instance, some of the guitars and vocals on \\"Spindrift\\" come through the rear channels to give a truly unique experience.  The mix can be a little \\"Bass-y\\" at times, but so can being in the front row of any large venue concert.  If you are an old Rush fan, or someone who has just discovered this album, The MVI DVD is what I'd buy.      I am a consumate Rush fan, so I have both CD and DVD, but what's extremely cool about this format is that you do not have to sacrifice the high sound quality of 5.1 audio to have your music portable.  The fact that one can download the compressed files onto their MP3 player is ingenious.  I hope the format takes off (unlike SACD), because I think the versatility is great, and \\"Snakes and Arrows\\"  is the perfect album to drive such an innovative format.  Get it Now!
0399230033|5.0|My 7 month old son LOVES this book.  It is part of his bedtime routine and it is now his favorite book.  He looks at every picture and loves the woman's expression at the end. Sometimes we describe what is going on to him, but often we just turn the pages and I see his eyes scanning the scenes.
B00005JPKE|5.0|Great movie.  Clint Eastwood is one the best directors of our time.  Ken Watanabe is superb.  I enjoyed this movie immensely.
B000E1JOSE|5.0|Roy Orbison, Bruce Springteen, Elvis Costello and more. What's not to like. Golden Oldie for everybody out there who loves Rock and Roll. Doen't hurt that Amazon shipped it to me in 4 days.
B000EGFVQS|3.0|I suppose that all books that get a lot of critical attention experience some kind of backlash, but I felt that the 1-star reviews were a bit harsh.  I did not think this was mind-blowing but it was better than it was bad.    The good points were that I liked the author's take on heaven/pre-heaven.  Criticism that it is not the Biblical Heaven seems overreaching since the book makes no attempt at all to be religious or even overtly spiritual;   it's apples and oranges.    The adolescent characters are the best and are reasonably interesting.  There are a variety of them and not all of them are completely obvious (an older brother who dropped out of high school to open a motorcycle shop turns out to be a good friend rather than the thug he might have been in another novel).    The weakest points were the rather pat ending and Susie's parents, who never really came together as \\"whole\\" people.  Her father, in particular, seemed to be pieced together from exterior stressors rather than a self-sustaining character.    In answer to some of the other criticisms I've read here:    1) I did not think Susie Salmon's name was that funny.  My mother's maiden name was Salmon and one of the reasons she changed her name upon marriage in the Feminist Seventies was that she was sick to death of being called \\"Fish\\".  Furthermore, had she been a boy, she and her brothers would have been Tom, Dick, and Harry.    2) I did not think that Holly's decision not have an accent in heaven was racist.  She had already renamed herself for Holly Golightly, borrowing a new Americanized identity to make herself less conspicuous; the neighborhood's initial suspicion of the Indian immigrant Ray Singh supports this. I interpreted the loss of her accent as an adolescent's wish to fit in rather than the author's attempt to \\"improve\\" a minority character.  One could speculate that, since Susie grows as a person through the book, Holly will as well and might someday take her accent back.    3) Yes, the stereotype of the serial killer is the middle-aged white male.  That's because, statistically, most serial killers are middle-aged white males.  Look it up.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is a MUST for opera lovers!  The three - Domingo, Netrebko,and Villazon were not only excellent in voice and charisma, but also in their selections.  This would be a great way to introduce classical music to those who don't understand what fun it can be!
0316166685|3.0|I didn't think this was a mind-blowing book but I thought the 1- and 2-star reviews were a bit harsh.  I suppose that books that garner a lot of critical acclaim inevitably experience some backlash.    I thought the concept of heaven, or pre-heaven, or whatever it was, was interesting and made more sense than whatever is supposed to be the Biblical version of Heaven.  Even if it didn't, there is really no reason to compare the two views.  The author makes no allusions to Biblical Heaven at all so I don't see why she should be criticized for setting a \\"poor example\\"; this makes no attempt to be a religious or even an overtly spiritual book.    I also thought that the adolescent characters were better than the shallow brats often depicted in novels, and they grow up to be interesting individuals.  There are a variety of them, too, and they are not always completely predictable: Stoners, the slightly pretentious, oddballs, normal ones, sensitive ones.  An older brother who runs a motorcycle shop turns out to be a good friend rather than the thug one might expect.      I thought the weakest parts were the rather pat ending and Susie's parents, who never quite filled out into believable, coherent people.  Jack Salmon in particular seems to be pieced out of external stressors rather than developing a character of his own.    1) I didn't think \\"Susie Salmon\\" was an unbelievable name; my mother's maiden name was \\"Salmon\\" and people called her \\"Fish\\" all the time.  One of the reasons she changed her name upon marriage in the Feminist Seventies was because she was sick of being called \\"Fish\\".  Furthermore, had she been a boy, Mom and her brothers would have been Tom, Dick, and Harry.    2)I didn't think that Holly's desire to lose her accent was \\"racist\\".  I interpreted this as an adolescent desire to fit in rather than the author's attempt to \\"improve\\" a racial minority.  She has already chosen a new name from a popular American movie, suggesting that she feels conspicuous (especially so, perhaps, in the early 1970's).  Holly was a minor character but we could speculate that, since Susie grew as a person, Holly likely did, too, and might at some point wish for her accent back.
1594489505|5.0|This book was much better than the Kite Runner.  I couldn't put it down and stayed up until 2a.m reading it, but did not finish it.  The next day I finished it and wound up crying at the end.  It is so moving.
0743298020|5.0|I had to read this for a book club, and i'm SOOOO thankful for that. It starts off a little slow, but when it picks up...it's brilliant. I read it in a weekend, only putting it down when my husband forced me to go to bed 'cause I refused to stop on Saturday night.    I guarantee you'll get sucked into the mystery/suspense of this book and you'll love the ending.
B00004YRQA|1.0|INSANELY OVERPRICED FOR AN 8MB STORAGE CARD...TEHN AGAIN LEAVE IT TO SONY TO DO SO.  THE CARD WORKS...WORKS GREAT?...I DONT KNOW, IT DOES WHAT IT SUPPOSE TO DO.
B000P0J024|5.0|CD of excellent quality -- additional tracks are a real value add. The DVD is very well done. It gives an excellent history of the Travelling Wilbury's and included a nice tribute to Roy Orbison
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This album is an absolute work of art.  I'm a fan of Progressive metal/rock, and I truely think this is one of the best albums Iron Maiden has recorded, if not the best.     See, before I bought and listened to this album, I wasn't a huge Maiden fan.  I liked their songs, but they never quite hooked me enough.  But I read a couple of online reviews for this album.  They were praising it: \\"Five stars!\\" \\"More progressive than ever before!\\"  \\"Best from Maiden in years!\\"  So, I was anxious to listen.    I went out, bought the album, put it in my CD player, and listened.  How it blew me away.    Ever since, I've been a huge Maiden fan, and I now have almost all of their studio albums.  So, you could say, this album made me a Maiden fan.      So anyway, let's get to the point.  After all, you aren't here to read about how I became a Maiden fan, you're here to read about the album.      \\"Different World\\", the rocker-single opening is great; very catchy.  Man, do they know how to solo.     \\"These Colours Don't Run\\" is one of my personal favorites from the album.  I love the slow opening, then transitioning to fast-paced, amped up, in-your-face anthem.  It's great really.  After all of these years, Bruce can still hit those high notes.    \\"Brighter Than a Thousand Suns\\", an epic song about 8 and a half minutes long, is also one of my favorites.  It has many changes melodically, which keeps the song interesting.  Again, I praise Bruce for still being able to hit such high notes.  And Steve Harris is perhaps one of the best songwriters known to humankind.  His lyrics are deep and meaningful, and like nothing you've ever heard before.    \\"The Pilgrim\\" This song was the first I truly loved on the album.  It has a very, very catchy chorus and opening.  The riff is quite unique, and I could listen to this song for hours without getting sick of it.    \\"The Longest Day\\" I believe this song's lyrics refer to D-Day in WWII, correct me if I'm mistaken.  It really has a powerful effect.It starts off slow, like many songs in the album, but, of course, the riff kicks in, and instantly the audience nods along.  Quite a catchy song, with great lyrics.    \\"Out of the Shadows\\" The opening riff to this song is kind of mystifying.  The band works together in a way nobody can duplicate.      \\"The Reincarnation of Benjaming Breeg\\"  This is my absolute favorite on the album, and probably my favorite Maiden song overall.  The opening is a slow, dramatic riff, followed by a short, soft vocal bit.  And again, the song transitions to a heavy, heavy riff, which I find quite catchy.  The song has a lot of transitions, and only if you hear it, you'll know what I'm talking about when I say, it's one of the best songs I've heard in ages.    \\"For the Greater Good of God\\"  This is beat only by Benjamin Breeg.  The lyrics in this song are very powerful, and the riff truly fits.  Once again, it starts off slow, and then slowly builds.  Bruce's voice amazes me on each and every song on the album, especially this song.  He has a different singing style from earlier albums, and I quite like it.  The chorus is catchy, and this is another of those songs I could listen to for hours and not get sick of.  This song is the longest on the album, reaching an epic 9 minutes and 24 seconds, and every second of this song is amazing.  Definitely a classic.    \\"Lord of Light\\" This one also starts off slow, and it sounds like religion is a theme in the lyrics.  Adrian, Dave, and Janick really show their skills on this album, and this song is a highlight for them, I think.      \\"The Legacy\\" This is song also starts off slow, with a hauntingly beautiful melody in the beginning.  It's really quite a unique song.  Many transitions, once again, and another highlight of the guitarists' skills.  This one is also quite powerful lyrically and melodically.  Definitely one of my favorites.      And there you have it.  That's my opinion of this work of art.  Up the irons.
0743289684|5.0|I could never let it out of my hand until I finished it. Even when I finished it, that's all I could talk about with my boyfriend, who is also crazy for good books. It's a masterpiece, and the woman is unbelievable! Praises for her! People like her are world-shakers!
B000002LQR|5.0|quick review: Rhcp is one of the best bands ever! if you love their funk/funk get this album! it mixes funk, hip hop, and rock for an awesome, original sound! the best are: suck my kiss, give it away, blood sugar sex magik, under the bridge, sir psycho sexy. but almost every song sounds good! a rare feat for artists! they took their time to create this great album! if you noticed when they do a hits album, most of the songs come from this album b/c the songs are so good!
B00000J7JO|5.0|i've admired RHCP for a very long time. always considered them a HIGLY underrated band. they create such funky, original, alternative rock music. they just have a sound that no one has. this album is probably my fave from them. they've slowed it down a bit, with less funky stuff but it's still as good. i love Scar tissue. there's not much slow, sad, soul- serching songs (which this is) that can sound good. this does. i absolutely loved it when i first heard it. love the guitar hook. californication is another masterpiece with an amazing guitar sound. \\"all around the world\\" is an awesome  album opener! it's rockin, funky; it just shows that there's no one doing music like the Peppers. that song is 100% quality. i also enjoyed \\"Right on time\\" very disco and funky. i also liked This velvet glove, get on top, and definitely Emmit remmus. almost all the songs sound good! kiedis' voice also soars on this album. as i said i love when artists evolve their sound and don't come with the same thing over and over (Beyonce). i'm so tried of fake artists with fake sounds. the peppers definitely moved to another level with this album but a few songs still had their old funk. too bad they are not recognized as much as they should be.
B000002J03|5.0|The only way to get the great classic combo (heard primarily on the radio) that transitions the song \\"Heartbreaker\\" to \\"Living and Loving\\" is on Led Zeppelin II.
0743554450|5.0|Khaled Hosseini paints a vivid picture of life in a society that Americans would find totally alien. This novel concentrates on the lives of several women in Afghanistan spanning a period of time from the 1950's up to the present. The main characters live an existence largely controlled, even dictated, by the men that pass through their lives. Some are warm and compassionate, but far too may others are radically intolerant and brutally misogynistic. As if this weren't enough, the Soviet occupation, followed by the Taliban reign of terror adds the risk of sudden, violent, random death and maiming by rocket fire and landmines.<br /><br />For me, the first part of this novel went rather slowly. But, just as I was about to lose interest, the story picked up the pace, and I was practically spellbound until the end.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|One of the best live performance albums ever.  Released today, it provides a rare crystallized insight into the explosive creativity of Neil Young in the early 1970s.  This recording is as intimate as it gets -and as honest as true confession.    Brilliant, moving, passionate, real.  Oh, how rare that is in 2007.  How joyful when you hear it.
0553383663|4.0|I almost finished reading this book -- I lost interest toward the very end. It provides a lot of insight into the events and timing that lead to Google's success. One of the best takeaways: a little section that tells you all the things you can do on [...]. Like you can enter calculations (e.g., 243x2=) into the search bar and get an answer!
B0006J28MI|3.0|Richie Rich is a thoroughly ridiculous movie - ridiculous situations, ridiculous characters, ridiculously large (but very real Biltmore Estate) mansion, and its ridiculously fun too.  Like Spiderman, Superman, Batman, and others, the character of Richie Rich is based on a comic book superhero.  Richie Rich offers us a different type of superhero in that his super power consists of the ridiculous amount of $$$$$ he has.  Richie and his family can do amazing things with their superpower. They can build their own Mount Richmore, build a McDonald's in their basement, have their own rollercoaster, jet all over the world and more. Just as most kids have dreamed of being able to fly like Superman and swing from webs like Spidey, kids and adults alike have dreamt of what it would be like to have Bill Gates' billions.  And like Superman, Batman, Spidey, etc., the Rich family uses their superpower to help others.      Another similarity between Richie and other comic book heroes is that just as Superman, Spidey and Batman's superpowers keep them from getting and/or keeping a girl - Richie's superpower keeps him from getting and keeping friends.  This movie is about how all that changes.  Though Richie's $$$$$ plays an initial role in introducing him to potential friends, it's not what enables him to keep them - Richie is genuinely a nice kid.      Sure its silly and ridiculous but guess what - its supposed to be.  For me the less than stellar acting and profuse overacting on the part of some of the actors just adds to the overall ridiculousness.  This is a fun family movie - just remember that you're watching a comic book.
1594489505|5.0|I was hesitant to read a book about war-torn Afghanistan because I see so much of it in the news every day. But I am so glad I did! This is an engaging, heartfelt, and very well-written account of life -- especially the life of women -- in modern-day Afghanistan. Warning: it's a tear jerker.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|The actors and actresses are not beautiful or well known (at least not by American standards) but they all give wonderful portrayals of the characters Austen sets forth in her book.  The cover of the original VHS box showed a much younger, beautiful couple who never appear in the film.  I'm glad that the current DVD box has fixed that problem and shows Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds on the cover.  The film story is very faithful to the book.  I cringe at the way Anne's father and sister treat her and at how stupidly, selfish her sister Mary is - and I am supposed to feel this way.  These actors and actresses do a great job.  It is fun to see Anne blossom and become more self-assured (and prettier) as the movie progresses.  Ciaran Hinds, if not a to-die-for hottie in the tradition of Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy, is quite dashing in that British Naval officer uniform.
B00042YBTK|5.0|I've had this album since 1970 in one form or another.  I don't listen to it very often but when I do I am still amazed at it.  I have many many records, cd's, mp3s, reel to reel  tapes and cassettes. I'm obsessed with music, just about every kind of   music except Rap and Punk or Heavy Metal.   This album beats them all.  But it is also in a class all it's own.  There's many many great albums that you just put on and they sound great  whatever your doing. Some even help you do whatever.   This is not one of those albums. This is special.   Like the girl you keep away from your friends and only have   dinner with by candlelight and just look at eachother.    Forget HOUSE OF THE RISING SUN,   DON'T LET ME BE MISUNDERSTOOD and  WE GOTA GET OUT OF HERE.  The animals have left the planet.   Eric Burdon's voice is the only familiar thing here.   They have all been taken over by aliens.  You'll know what I mean when you hear those aliens in your head.    SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS  This album requires special listening situations.     1 - ABSOLUTLEY NO DISTRACTIONS   2 - lay down   3 - most important listen with headphones.       Don't ruin it, you need headphones.   4 - in short don't do anything except listen.   5 - start listening with GEMINI, THE MADMAN    as Eric Burdon says in San Francisan nights,   \\"IT WILL BE WORTH IT\\"    optional, get high first, it gets even better.    If you follow my guidelines you won't be listening  to music you'll be having an experience.  Notes and voices and images will be floating around   in your head like you can't image.  And like Gemini, you'll feel both sides.  Beware though, after hearing this you'll be looking for a little   something extra from your music. More in the left speaker and   something different in the right.   You'll begin to question why can't there be more records produced   like this. I wouldn't want all records produced like this.   One is great.    Listening to this album with headphones   will take TOTO out of Kansasfor awhile and that's always nice.    If you liked this EXPERIENCE then you're ready for the next;  THE TWAIN SHALL MEET,   same aliens but now their on a different planet.    If you can't relax or don't like headphones forget this album.  It would be like asking Jesus a question   and not paying attention to the answer. Why waste your time.
0385338902|5.0|If you were to open the dictionary to the word \\"immature,\\" you might very well find Doug Parker's boyish twenty-nine-year-old face staring back at you.  You may notice that he appears drunk and/or stoned as well as unkempt and unfocused.  A year earlier, Doug suddenly became a widower when his gorgeous older wife, Hailey, died in an airplane crash somewhere over Colorado.<br /><br />In Jonathan Tropper's profane, raunchy, and sharply satirical \\"How to Talk to a Widower,\\" Doug doesn't buy into the concepts of closure, grief therapy, and \\"moving on with your life.\\"  Instead, he is mired in a bottomless swamp of self-pity.  He spends many aimless and stultifying hours vegetating on his front porch in suburban Westchester, tossing rocks and beer cans at the rabbits that congregate on his lawn.  He can afford to zone out because he has a roof over his head (he lives in Hailey's house) and a large settlement coming from the airline.  Not that Doug has ever been a financial go-getter.  His previous work experience has been spotty at best, and the only stab he currently makes at meaningful employment is an occasional magazine article about life as a disconsolate widower.  Surprisingly, his magazine pieces strike a chord with the public, and his agent excitedly informs him that he may be able to get him a lucrative publishing deal complete with media coverage.<br /><br />Doug is not alone in his misery.  Hailey's sixteen-year-old son, Russ, is a troubled adolescent who has been coping badly in the aftermath of his mother's death.  Russ lives unhappily with his father, Jim, whom he detests, and his bimbo of a stepmother, Angie.  The boy is a pothead who gets into frequent scrapes, and he frequently hints that he would like to live with Doug.  However, his stepfather rejects the young man's overtures, since Doug cannot be bothered with other people's problems.<br /><br />Tropper's cast of well-drawn characters include Claire, Doug's potty-mouthed and aggressive twin sister who freely dispenses advice to her brother while she screws up her own life, Doug's father, a doctor who has survived a stroke that left his mind and personality forever altered, and Brooke Hayes, a twenty-seven year old high school guidance counselor with whom Doug forms an instant connection.<br /><br />As Doug emerges from his torpor, he makes some serious mistakes, and the book closes on a bittersweet note.  The hero admits, \\"At this point in my life, I'm not looking for any happy endings.  I'm just looking to get things started again.\\"  \\"How to Talk to a Widower\\" starts out as a depressing tale of an obnoxiously self-centered individual.  Fortunately, Tropper cultivates some fertile topics that will resonate with readers:  family ties may constrict us, but our otherwise irritating relatives may provide loving support when we need it most; each day on earth is a frightening and unpredictable game of Russian roulette; some men, the \\"Peter Pans\\" among us, are late bloomers who grow up slowly, if at all; and we must take daunting emotional risks if we are to have any chance at happiness.  After an inauspicious opening, the author finds his voice, and the book takes off to become riotously funny, deeply moving, and ultimately redemptive.ce to her brother while she screws up her own life, Doug's father, a doctor who has survived a stroke that left his mind and personality forever altered, and Brooke Hayes, a twenty-seven year old high school guidance counselor with whom Doug forms an instant connection.

B00005LC1H|4.0|Kevin Murphy of Mystery Science Theater 3000 (another show all comedy fans should own on DVD) said it best once when he referred to Fawlty Towers as the \\"greatest sitcom\\" ever. I simply cannot say enough good things about the show. Even after repeated viewings over many years it is amazingly funny; no surprise there, Cleese and Booth crafted each script for six weeks till the comedy was honed to a razor edge. By limiting themselves to just six shows per series and spacing the two series a few years apart, they were able to spend enough time on each script to ensure that there were no wasted lines or filler, it's pure comedy from start to finish. Nearly every moment of the show is used as an opportunity to generate laughter.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD set are also worth viewing. They include a concise, informative interview with John Cleese, a brief bit about the fate of the building used as Fawlty Towers in the show, a documentary on the Gleneagles Hotel in England which inspired the show, and more.<br /><br />My only complaint about this DVD set and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the picture quality. The picture quality is simply inexcusable for DVD. It is grainy and fuzzy in many spots and there are even some color anomalies that pop up occasionally. A show of this caliber certainly deserves better, especially on a medium that can provide terrific picture quality. My old VHS copy of the show had a better picture quality. The DVD at times looks degraded in a way similar to a VHS tape that has been watched hundreds of times.<br /><br />Picture quality notwithstanding, any comedy fan, especially those who appreciate off-beat comedy like Monty Python's Flying Circus, Black Adder, Mystery Science Theater 3000, Red Dwarf, etc. will LOVE Fawlty Towers. In spite of the picture quality, you will enjoy this immensely.
0060594896|5.0|Imagine yourself in a bookstore waiting for someone to make a quick purchase.  Your mind is on other things as you walk by a bookshelf.  You pick up a book titled \\"The Success Principles\\" by Jack Canfield.  You open it up...start reading...and you can't put down.  You just have to buy it and read it immediately!  That's what happened to me.  I was planning a new business, I wanted to make some changes in my life and in my outlook, and this book proved to be the sought after tool.  It's clear, concise, practical and is jam-packed with useful information.  \\"The Success Principles\\" is must reading for anyone looking for a new perspective in their personal and professional development.
0618551050|5.0|The best review of a scientific field I have ever read. This book has really stimulated my interest in unification physics, Lee Smolin has done a superb job in presenting a very complex and confusing subject- it held my attention life a good mystery.
B00006RG9K|5.0|I really enjoy the music of Genesis from all eras but ny favorite era is Phil Collins.  All of the songs on this DVD are fantastic!  Phil Collins is definately the star here.The talents of the other musician are great as well.    These performances are from a few Earl Court shows whic were performed in November of 1992. Towards the end of the \\"We Can't Dance Tour\\"  My favorite song from this collection is the Old Medley which contacts a few minutes of the following songs. \\"Dance On A Volcano, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway, The Musical Box, Firth Of Fith, I know what I Like In Your Wardrobe, Illegal Alien, That's All & Misunderstanding\\"    The bonus section features interviews with Tony Banks, Phil Collins & Mike Rutherford.    If you like the Phil Collins era of Genesis or just like good rock music performed by 5 great Musicians (Genesis brings Daryl Stuermer Guitars & Bass & Chester Thompson Drums & Percussion) to help out with the extra musical duties of both Collins & Rutherford respectively.)    Go out and buy this DVD immediately!!!
0307275639|5.0|I read this book several years ago and picked it up again recently.  This is one of those rare gems that draws you back over the years.  Whenever there are moments of sickness or death, sometimes it is tough to find inspiration.    Morrie is pure inspiration.  The line of \\"In dying, Morrie taught us how to live,\\" fits this book perfectly.  I am glad to have read it in my 20s and am now again examining it in my 30s and his wisdom seems both timelessly relevant and layered.    If you haven't read this book, pick it up.  I especially encourage young people to read it.  Even though the topic of dying may seem far away, this book has little to do with death, and so much more to do with life.    Some feel that it is \\"self-help\\" or \\"sappy.\\"  Nonsense.  It is about a real man, who in dying, wanted his death to be meaningful in some way.  I think this book inspires us to make our lives meaningful, as well.    Morrie was one of those rare gifted sagacious humans that possessed a spirit that reflects the best in human possibilities.  Mitch Albom does a good job capturing it.  Their \\"last thesis\\" together is a true contribution.  I give this book my highest possible recommendation.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Rush is my favorite band so it maybe hard to write an honest review since I like pretty much everything this wonderful band has put out.    I will admit when I first heard this album I wasn't really impressed because there really wasn't any hooks on this album but after multiple listens to each song individually I really started to like this album.  Neil Peart's lyrics on this album are phenomonal.  He really has matured as a lyricisr and a drummer.  Alex Lifeson really stands out on this album. Listen to the song \\"Hope\\" and you'll know what i'm talking about.  Geddy Lee the bassist, Vocalist & keyboard player really breaths life into Neils lyrics.    The theme on this album is faith & spirituality.  Just listen to the songs \\"Armor & Sword & The Larger Bowl\\" and you'll know what i'm talking about.    Rush themselves have said this was one of their favorite albums that they have ever made. On their current tour they perform nine songs out of the thirteen from Snakes & Arrows  It is one of their most selling albums and charted high on billboard since the release of Counterparts which was released originally in 1993.    So go out and buy this albuma and if you have the time go see them on their current world tour.  You won't be dissapointed.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Steel Magnolias of the 1939?  This dynamite film is \\"all about men.\\"  But guess what, there isn't a single man in it!  And you won't miss them.  Even though there's nary a male, the film is all about pursuing and keeping men.  It's also about sage advice from Mother, a certain shade of nail varnish, and a new perfume called \\"Spring Rain.\\"  You've got ringside seats to see the fight of the century:  in one corner the \\"ladies who lunch\\" and in the other corner,  the challenger,  women who work for a living.  With clothes to die for, a technicolor fashion show, and frequent glimpses of Miss Shearer's huge ring, this is better than a sale at Bergdorfs.  The women without a male meal ticket are on the prowl.  Starring doe-eyed Norma Shearer, leopard-lipped Joan Crawford and spaghetti-spined Rosalind Russell,  \\"The Women\\" is an Anita Loos screenplay based on the play by Clare Booth Luce. Directed by George Cukor.   Give it as bridesmaid gifts, include it in every trousseau.   Buy it and invite your girlfriends over for a slumber party.
B00009W0WM|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" - oh, \\"Casablanca.\\"  What could one possibly say about \\"Casablanca\\" that has not been said a million times by a million people or more?  Let me ask this: have you seen \\"Casablanca\\"?  If you have not, my friend, this writing cannot convey the strength with which I recommend that you purchase - not rent, purchase - this film immediately.  And if, for some reason, you should ask me why, I will tell you that \\"Casablanca\\" belongs in every person's cinematic library, because it is quite possibly the finest film ever released.<br /><br />The word \\"classic\\" applies to no film, NO FILM, not \\"Citizen Kane,\\" not \\"The Godfather,\\" none of these, so much as it applies to \\"Casablanca.\\"  Every last scene is classic.  Every line is classic.  Everything about it is classic, not because it's an old film, but because it IS film.  \\"Casablanca\\" is the very embodiment of why movies are made, and it has all the elements of impeccable filmmaking.  You have a situation with which the audience can sympathize: a man's world is turned upside down when his long-lost love walks into his saloon.  The man is a classic example of the \\"tragic hero\\" who was so popular in 1940s and 50s cinema, particularly film noir: on the outside, he's a cynical, cold, wisecracking individual, but inside he's a kindhearted, courageous human being who can't help but do what's right.  That's why, when we discover that the object of his desire has a new man and loves him, we know that she should go off and live happily ever after with him, but we still root for her to wind up with our tragic hero.<br /><br />And no one plays the tragic hero like Humphrey Bogart.  One year earlier he'd delivered a knockout performance as just such a character in John Huston's \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" and two years later he'd play an identical character in Howard Hawks' \\"The Big Sleep\\" with future wife Lauren Bacall, but no one'll argue that Bogey never surpassed his performance as Rick in \\"Casablanca.\\"  There's something aboutHumphrey Bogart that remains unexplained to this day, something that made him so powerful a leading man.  Perhaps it was his effortless cool, or total confidence, or his sour tongue, or maybe just that twinkle in his eyes.  Whatever it was, there has never been a leading man quite so charismatic as Bogart in \\"Casablanca.\\"<br /><br />But a leading man is nothing without a leading lady, and so we have Ingrid Bergman, one of the screen's most dazzling beauties.  She was at her most dazzling in \\"Casablanca,\\" another tragic character whose actions are as heartbreaking to the audience as they are to Rick, but in the end they're understandable and we sympathize.  Despite their charm, so many classic leading ladies just let the drama flow in their performances.  But not Bergman.  She put every fiber of her being into her performance, and she breathes so much humanity into the character of Ilse that we can't help but forgive her and sympathize.<br /><br />Equally important is the supporting cast.  It's amazing how vibrant each of the characters are, no matter how small or large their roles.  Claude Rains' character is particularly interesting: he walks the line between the good guys and the bad guys throughout the picture, sometimes swaying to one side and sometimes to the other, but we're never quite sure who's side he's on until the climax.  Rick's employees are just as charming as their boss, among them pianist Sam, played by Dooly Wilson, goodhearted waiter Carl (S.Z. Sakall), and wirey bartender Sascha (Leonid Kinskey).  Sydney Greenstreet, who also appeared with Bogart in \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" plays Rick's rival, Ferrari, described by Rick as \\"a fat hypocrite.\\"  Conrad Veidt is the real villain of the picture, Nazi Major Strasser, and last but not least, Peter Lorre is the thug who sets the wheels in motion.<br /><br />So much of \\"Casablanca\\"'s appeal lies in its story and characters.  The story is timeless, romantic, and, of course, dramatic.  The setting is a character unto itself, a mangy hellhole stuck somewhere in the middle of the war, which so far has remained safe from enemy troops, but the promise of occupation grows stronger each day.  The grimness of the war is a powerful backdrop for Rick and Ilsa's love, the shining light through all the darkness.  In Darren Aronofsky's recent film \\"The Fountain,\\" a character philosophizes, \\"Every shadow is threatened by the morning light.\\"  That philosophy was cemented in \\"Casablanca,\\" where good triumphs evil, and it will always triumph so long as people are willing to fight.  The film says that there is goodness in us all; some are destined to see this, and others are not.  In one scene, Rick asks a hero of the resistance, \\"Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this?  I mean what you're fighting for.\\"<br /><br />The resistance fighter replies, \\"You might as well question why we breathe.  If we stop breathing, we'll die.  If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.\\"<br /><br />Of course, Bogey cracks, \\"Well, what of it?  It'll be out of its misery.\\"<br /><br />But the resistance man, the movie's \\"stalwart hero,\\" knows better.  \\"You know how you sound, Mr. Blaine?\\" he asks.  \\"Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.\\"<br /><br />Heart is something this film has no shortage of - that and humanity.  \\"Casablanca\\" is as 'human' as film as ever there was.  And though lifelike characters have become a staple of modern dramatic cinema, so many characters in older films felt like just that: characters in a movie, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing for those films.  But the characters in \\"Casablanca\\" have a remarkably deep, realistic feel to them.  They each have a story to tell, a life of their own, human feelings, human desires.  Most importantly, they each have the urge to do good in the end, no matter their position in the world.<br /><br />The actual techniques employed in the film are resistant to any criticism whatsoever.  The songs composed for the movie, greats like \\"It Had to Be You\\" and, in particular, the (ironically) timeless \\"As Time Goes By,\\" add so much emotion to the film.  The flashback sequence was possibly the first to ever figure prominently in a major motion picture, and it's one of the most strong and memorable scenes in the movie.  The editing is flawless - tight, concise, steady-paced, exactly what it should be.  Finally, the photography is beautiful.  Every shot is like a painting, a moment to be treasured forever and ever were it not instantly replaced by the next wonderful frame.<br /><br />In all these many, many years since the release of \\"Casablanca,\\" it hasn't lost any of its power; in fact, as time goes by, the movie may actually become more powerful.  Certainly, no film has ever been more powerful than this, and none have ever been so bittersweetly perfect.  This is the crown jewel of artistic achievement.  This is why we have movies.  This is film.  This is life.  Whether it's the greatest film in history will always be the subject of much debate, but no sane person will deny that \\"Casablanca\\" is among the absolute finest masterworks of cinema.  \\"We'll always have Paris,\\" Rick tells Ilsa in one of the film's signature scenes.  Until the end of time, cinema lovers will always have and treasure \\"Casablanca.\\"
0151012768|5.0|Certainly the idea of establishing a viable salmon run in Yemen is, if not impossible, pretty darned close, and normally staid and compliant British biologist Alfred (Fred) Jones isn't shy about telling his superior so when his fisheries agency is approached to formulate a plan to do just that. Yet, Fred is dragooned into designing and overseeing the project anyway. His wife, Mary, is so preoccupied with her time-consuming career in finance, that she isn't the slightest interested in hearing about salmon in Yemen, so neglected Fred begins to form a confiding friendship with a younger woman, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot, the agent for the sheikh who is the creator and the bankroller of this salmon fantasia. Harriet opens Fred's eyes to the basically petrified habits of his life with her charm, her femininity, and her vulnerability. At the same time, both Fred and Harriet are changed by the \\"almost holy\\" Sheikh Muhammad ibn Zaidi bani Tihama, the Islamic visionary whose own belief in belief rubs off on them.<br /><br />SALMON FISHING IN THE YEMEN is a smart, bittersweet send-up of bureaucracy, politicians, marriage, international relations, and fly fishing, among other things. So many books published these days can easily be fitted into genres and follow numbingly-familiar formulas. Paul Torday, in this, his first novel, demonstrates that deft, thinking-outside-the-box fiction is all-getout enjoyable. Although a few lesser plot points play out predictably enough, unpredictability wins the day where it counts. And although this isn't a pat alls-well-that-ends-well yarn, it leaves the reader (this one anyway) satisfied and enriched. This is satire, yes, but not a an lightweight \\"fish story.\\" This a tender tale of adult growing pains and quasi-spiritual advancement. If unassuming and unimaginative Fred can learn to believe, can't we all?<br /><br />Anglers, dreamers, and everyone else, treat yourself!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|This CD is simply outstanding!  Kelly Rocks it out again!  I think that this CD is such a wonderful songwriting CD.  Sober is absolutely the best song on this entire album.

Thanks Kelly for always making music that touches our hearts!
0618526412|3.0|I can't say I found this book to be an enjoyable read.  Its a depression era tale that begins with a feeling of gloom and never takes an upturn. No doubt the description of the difficult time rings true.  My parents  experienced the depression era first hand and had tales of their own.  Considering the date this book was written, I'm sure Carson McCullers based some of these events on her personal experiences.       Mick's viewpoint is a coming of age story. Her relationships, experiences  and her obsession with music are described with the depression era influence as a backdrop. In the end we are left with her realization that without a job she will never be able to afford to continue with her music studies.  With the job after school, she has needed funds but no energy to work on music studies.    Sadly, the person everyone seeks out to confide in is Mr. Singer, a deaf-mute.  Towns people confide in and admire him and communicate on a one-on-one basis only.  As a group, each one is ill at ease. They each know he cannot repeat private conversations to anyone else.  Ultimately, he feels hopeless and isolated. Deep depression when his best friend dies drives him to suicide      Dr. Copeland is respected, although misunderstood, by members of the black community (including his own family). His political leanings toward the teachings of Karl Marx, combined with his lack of religious beliefs, causes feelings of isolation.       The book is well written.  Unfortunately the entire story is sad. It begins with a feeling of sadness and ends with a feeling of hopelessness. While I don't always expect happy endings, I prefer a story that gives hope that maybe there will be better times ahead.

B000002UAO|5.0|At an abundant time of musical creativity, George Martin keeps released material progressing at a pace that connects us with some familiarities found in their earlier music and yet must begin to open the door for us to witness the musical revolution he saw emerging shortly, and still managed well having the support of the four.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|Adapted from a Stephen King story, Darabont's \\"Redemption\\" reinvigorates the prison-drama genre with a robust, deeply touching story about courage, friendship, and the persistence of hope amid the regimentation of life in the Big House. Robbins gives a masterful performance as the aloof, enigmatic inmate whom everyone--including the bulls--comes to respect. And Freeman brings his own Southern gentility to the role of Red, the wizened con whose bond with Andy takes him to a very unexpected place: the outside world. Excellent support from James Whitmore, William Sadler, Bob Gunton, and gorgeous camerawork by Roger Deakins makes this crowd-pleasing \\"Redemption\\" song worth hearing more than once.
0385522401|5.0|The book is fascinating reading and an indictment against repressed sexuality.  An earlier period than the 1960s might have been more realistic.  I grew up in the 1950s, admittedly not in  England.  My friends and I were sexually more liberated as were the girls I dated.  But perhaps I was lucky to not live in England, to have the right friends, and to date the right girls!
6305949980|5.0|Produced by Tim Burton (who also co-wrote the story), Henry Selick's Gothic holiday fantasy blends state-of-the-art stop-motion animation with an imaginative, light-heartedly eerie story about a clever spook who decides to reinvent Christmas. Along the way, the jack-o-lantern-headed Jack (amiably voiced by Chris Sarandon) has to square off against his evil nemesis, Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), who has sinister plans of his own. With Danny Elfman's frightfully jolly score and a bright script based on characters Burton created, this is a \\"Nightmare\\" the whole family will enjoy (though smaller fry might get spooked at times).
B00002MZ4V|5.0|In the past when I went to movies, I rarely thought about the music unless it was a popular song that was being played.  I never realized how much the score had to do with the overall effect I felt while watching the show.<br /><br />Once I started paying attention to the music and identifying different pieces that I enjoyed from different movies, I was suprized to realize that John Williams had composed many, many of them.<br /><br />This CD contains possibably the greatest most timeless music I have heard.  Sure, you, like my classical music loving boss, have probably already written off my opinion as foolish or ignorant.  Honestly, I don't care.<br /><br />I like Mozart, Bach and the rest, and they have their place, but their music doesn't move through me like Williams.  While this collection is far from a box set of his work, all the most popular pieces are there:  Raders March (Indiana Jones), Star Wars, Superman, Empire March (Darth Vader).  None of the operas or preludes the other guys made up generate the experience I get from listening to the opening stanza of Superman.<br /><br />While it is very hard to sing along to these pieces, if you have an office as I do, it makes great background music.  Everyone who comes in is pleasently caught off guard and I enjoy watching them trying to place the various songs that are playing.<br /><br />Even if you disagree that Williams is better than Wagner or Debussy, if you enjoy his music, you will love this CD.  \\"These are the droids you are looking for.\\"

B0000A1HQP|5.0|This crackling, uproarious urban farce playfully advances the notion that idiocy is far superior to arrogance. Adapted from a popular stage play, the film's plot hinges on a series of increasingly ridiculous mishaps (a back injury, ill-advised phone calls) in which the well-meaning Pignon--a lonely obsessive who crafts matchstick models of famous monuments--inadvertently makes Pierre's personal affairs hellishly complex. Diminutive French actor Villeret, who acted the part on-stage, is an endearing boob, playing beautifully off Lhermitte's handsome, patronizing cad. Hilarious and fun, \\"The Dinner Game\\" is an irresistible ode to the dimwit in all of us.
0783229526|5.0|I must say that Jeff Shannons review is his opinion but i couldnt disagree more. This is one of the funniest surreal and worthy adaptions of a book that seemed unfilmable. Gilliam Depp and Del toro along with an excellent cast of recoginizable faces make this an essential cult classic comedy. The images- camera angles- sets -visual effects- and fantastic chemistry between Depp and Del toro along with kitchsy soundtrack music are perfectly matched. I even go as far to judge my opinions on people i know as to whether they like this movie or not. Either you get it or you dont. Its that simple. You dont need to stoned or drunk to enjoy this film though it doesnt hurt. Johnny depp gives the peformance of a lifetime and i cant emphasize the small roles played by many well known actors- pretty much everyone does their part well. The dialogue is great and repeated viewings give something new each time. One of my favorite films and a must see if there ever was one.
0780619587|5.0|Involving, stunningly executed feature benefits from a smart, knowing script and an astonishing, Oscar winning performance by Rush as the adult David. (Noah Taylor also excels playing Helfgott as an adolescent). Mueller-Stahl makes your skin crawl as the haunted father. An often harrowing tale that ends on an uplifting, inspirational note.
B00005JPHT|4.0|Michael Moore's films subversively illuminate the failures of the American system, though his previous works have been damaged by conspiracy theorizing. That's a nonsensical practice because after conjecturing on how evil your opponents are, you then claim that they're an organized and intricate conspiracy, which requires a level of intelligence and discipline that you wouldn't grant them otherwise. That was the main flaw in Fahrenheit 9/11, but here Moore (mostly) dispenses with the theorizing and focuses more on his truly unique illustrations of the most outrageous absurdities of American health care. Deniers shouldn't shoot the messenger (Moore) when he shows that the idolized heroes of the 9/11 rescue effort are getting worse health care than terrorist prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, or that people who actually have full health insurance are still dying because of coarse denials from pencil pushers. And Moore's anonymous donation to the medical bills for the wife of his harshest critic is sheer system-jamming genius.<br /><br />Here Moore advances very illuminating commentary from his interview subjects - mostly regular folks who have been left behind by the failed system, plus folks in other countries who can barely comprehend the absurdity of that system. The best commentary is from a former member of the British Parliament who describes true democratic theory in ways that Americans would have once comprehended, but have long since forgotten in our slavish worship of corporatism. Anyone who thinks there's no problem with the American health care system hasn't had to deal with it, and fear-mongering and communist-baiting reform opponents do not have your best interests at heart. So they say that taxpayer-subsidized universal health care isn't an \\"American\\" value. Well is it an \\"American\\" value to let people die of curable diseases or injuries because they can't increase the bottom line of giant corporations that buy their power from your elected representatives? Moore provides plenty of evidence that the failed American health care system can hurt you too, and don't think it will never happen.<br /><br />All of the above is shockingly and depressingly evident in the movie. But there's just one vital flaw, of the type that lurks behind most of Moore's works. He's still implying quite strongly that the problems he describes are the result of uncaring corporatists hatching conspiracies behind the scenes. It's not quite that simple, because we live in a system in which everyone (even the health care industry) has the prerogative to work for their own best interests. The real problem is that those with money can do this much more effectively while everyone else falls behind. This is a systematic rather than a conspiratorial conundrum, and vast political and attitudinal changes amongst the American public will be necessary for any progress to be made. The calls for this type of action, and practical advice for getting started, are what's missing from Moore's activism.

B000A7DVR2|5.0|Ace filmmaking team Joel and Ethan Coen (\\"Fargo\\") took more than a few pages from Raymond Chandler's seedy L.A. noir novels to create this absurdly comic caper masterpiece. Bridges is riotous as the unflappable aging hippie who finds himself embroiled in double and triple extortion plots--think Phillip Marlowe on a bag of weed--while superb sidekicks Goodman and Buscemi get to sling around a lot of ripe witticisms. Also great is John Turturro, playing a vulgar-mouthed champion bowler named Jesus, and Julianne Moore, fetching as an \\"erotic artist.\\" In typical Coen fashion, the camerawork is wildly offbeat, the dialogue sharp, and the performances goofy and intriguing. Don't miss this kooky homage to the weird world of noir.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|None of the reviews have mentioned the words. I speak a little french but not enough so I googled the lyrics in french, and then copied them to babelfish and had them translated. THEY'RE SO GREAT! They're very smart and the philosophy is deep... really, they're not about how sad love is at all. If anything they're very playful and mischevious.  Je suis le plus beau she sings that she's the handsomest man in the neighborhood and all the women swoon for her, so do their husbands. In J'en Connais she talks about how her poor mama throws up her hands and says What have I done wrong. In Le Derniere Minute she sings, in one minute, how on her death bed she'll be pleading with death for one last minute...     The thing that makes her unique is how she sets a mood. It's very different from Sade or Nora Jones. Like them,  Her delivery and melodies are very intimate, as if she's singing in your ear. But what makes her sexy isn't fake sighs and the whimpers,it's the playful teasing tone. Like you're laying in bed with her, she tells you little fantasies and makes little murmuring jokes... What a sexy mood!     I'm besotted with her right now.
0784011176|5.0|Set in the 19th century, Jane Campion's brilliant period tale \\"The Piano\\" was rightly lauded in 1993 for its eccentric storyline and otherworldly, dreamlike atmosphere. Despite never uttering a word, Oscar winner Hunter exudes intelligence and determination as the rebellious Ada, along with a repressed yet combustible sensuality. Anna Paquin is a marvel in her debut, exemplifying the mix of spunk and knowingness that made her a sought-after young star. Visually ravishing and exquisite, \\"The Piano\\" is Campion's visually poetic ode to our unspoken emotions.
B000024JEX|5.0|This astonishing boxed set from the standards trio justifies a long essay as a minimum to do it justice. I will restrict myself to talking about a few tracks only.<br /><br />Disc 5 starts with a track 21 minutes long. After a slightly disguised Piano introduction Jarrett begins a long exploration of \\"On Green Dolphin Street\\". This swings like hell in places, is occasionally a little funky, and is never less than very inventive. Just after 8 minutes the first Piano solo ends! After a brief interlude of bass solo and drums/Piano exchanges the theme comes back and seamlessly becomes \\"Joy Ride\\" at around 12 minutes. This is one of Keith's own compositions and has a calypso feel to it. Well you can guess that he gets into this in a big way and the drive and interplay between the musicians justs gets better and better. This track alone made the boxed set worth getting.<br /><br />The other highlights on disc 5 are a rapid version of \\"You'd be so nice to come home to\\" and great version of Monks \\"Straight No Chaser\\".<br /><br />Of particular interest to me were two versions of \\"Things Ain't What They Used To Be\\". You will hear Jarrett use blues licks in his solos, but not often do hear him play an entire piece in a bluesy/gospel style. This is fantastic stuff, driven along by some great bass by Gary Peacock.<br /><br />I can't do justice to the set of 6 discs here. If you're a Jarrett fan and you don't have this collection, you should have. Likewise anybody interested in Piano trio Jazz should consider this an essential purchase. Its a shame more artists don't put out sets like this - although my bank manager might disagree.
B00005ATZT|5.0|A textbook example of a first-rate thriller, buoyed by Davis's breathless pacing and a picture-stealing performance from Jones, who won an Oscar. Drawing from his Indiana Jones days, Ford is just right as the besieged hero always one step ahead of disaster, but Jones's Gerard, whose drive is offset by a wry, folksy humor, is intensely charismatic as the intrepid hound-dog on Kimble's trail. Over ten years after its initial release, it's worth another peek if you haven't seen it since. First-timers should definitely plunge.
B000001DQI|5.0|Rightly this album is rated as the greatest album Elton John ever made. In fact its not my favourite but thats a different story.<br /><br />The breadth of material on this is amazing. It opens with 'Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding' which is a stunning prog-rock overture followed seamlessly by a hard rock song. Remember before he became Elton John the young Reg Dwight auditioned for both King Crimson and Gentle Giant!<br />Following track 1 is the original and best version of Candle in the Wind. Sadly this tune has been overplayed... Bennie and the Jets is track 3. A great crowd pleaser (with artificial live feel on the track). This track was huge in the U.S. and it went to the top of the R&B charts. It also best displays Elton's Piano playing and has a completely unique feel to it.<br /><br />The title track Goodbye Yellow Brick Road sounds like a standard that was written in the 40's or 50's. This is one of those songs that Elton will be remembered for in the decades to come.<br /><br />On these opening tracks you can hear (but not see!) everything that made Elton such a huge star:<br />Primarily great song-writing, but also high quality musicianship - listen to Nigel Olsson's drumming or Davey Johnstone's guitar playing on this album.<br /><br />With one exception the rest of the album maintains a similar high standard. Jamaica Jerk-Off is the one track I really don't like but there's 16 others so I'm not complaining!
1594489505|5.0|The Kite Runner is one of my favorite books, so I was really looking forward to reading Hosseini's second novel, and I was not disappointed. I could not put this book down.

B000R7I3LY|5.0|This album shows Sara Bareilles to be one of the great storytellers of her generation of singer/songwriters.  Her lyrics are universally accessible without being trite, innovative without being inane.  She weaves beautiful yarns that display emotions from anger to excitement to peace to fantasy all with an overtone of hope and positive energy.  Songs like \\"Love Song\\" and \\"Many the Miles\\" may make you want to dance while \\"Between the Lines\\" and \\"Come Round Soon\\" may break your heart, but all of it is uplifting, smart, and multilayered enough in lyrical and musical content that you can listen again and again, always finding new things to appreciate.    As many probably know, some of the songs on this album were featured on her earlier independent relase, Careful Confessions.  I hesitate to compare the versions on Little Voice to those earlier takes, simply because I think the aesthetic is different and each version of each song seems to function in its own way.  I loved the stripped down, piano-only \\"Love Song\\", and yet I think this new arrangement is tasteful and interesting and fits perfectly on the new album.  The same goes for her long-time favorite \\"Gravity\\" -- I fell in love with this song in the form it took on Careful Confessions, and yet I view the new arrangement with strings here as the form this song was always meant to take, at its best.  The only track I'm not crazy about is \\"Fairytale\\" -- I think the simple story of this song was better matched by the keyboard-only accompaniment from the earlier recording.  But it's a small quibble on a big album from a BIG new voice in music.    Meanwhile, the songs that were NOT released in another form earlier are, with few exceptions, my favorites.  \\"Vegas\\" is playful and cool, \\"Morningside\\" is full of rhythmic dynamism and attitude, \\"Many the Miles\\" lilts and grooves and invites you to sing right along.    If there is any justice or taste in the world, this woman will be a hit.
0385522401|5.0|Notwithstanding the book's short length, it was one that I had to read in small pieces over a few days.  There is a certain painful rawness in the tale that makes it a difficult emotional read, notwithstanding the fact that early on, you can guess just what's going to befall these two characters.    Ian McEwan has simply amazing powers - not only shown in his elegant prose but his ability to tell a story and craft a personal history.  Perhaps his greatest gift, however, is his ability to delve into the human mind and ultimately, the human heart.    I strongly recommend this book to any serious reader of fiction.    Thomas J. Rice
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is the best soundtrack in the \\"Pirates\\" series. Hans Zimmer has melded the Eastern sounds with the West and composed an intricate melody which is hard to forget. My favorite soundtrack so far!
1400079179|3.0|What to say? and Where to begin?<br />First of all I foung 'The DaVinci Code\\" to be very entertaining. It is a fast paced thriller with lots of action, intrigue and puzzles. Yes it's lightweight stuff, and Brown isn't the most talented writer, but it's fun.<br />Having already read 'Holy Blood, Holy Grail' some years ago, I was familiar with the main plot revelations already- but even so Brown kept me intrigued the whole way through.<br />What it is not, is an accurate representation of history. And Brown's New-Agism had me rolling my eyes a lot. Although having said that I didn't find it to be as anti- Catholic as some have made out.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|this album has all, speed,melodic in one word pure virtuosity.for me dream theater is one of the best bands period, they have influences from bands  like pink floyd,rush,genesis,metallica,iron maiden.in a few words you will love this album.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Going through the past comments, it's interesting to see all the feelings between love and hate pointed towards this album. This actually seems to be quite the typical response to most of the albums DT has released to the moment. Take this album for example. The metallists keep bashing songs like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Besides You\\". The prog heads are complaining about most songs except the last 2. Most people complain about DT not living up to the expectations with this album. I dare to disagree. DT always does a mixture of various other groups' sounds with their own music, a mixture of amaizing and mind blowing with uninteresting and too long and sloppy and crude. It's stuff for everyone in here. Just that one needs to filter out what does not like, and stick to what he likes. Take for example Liquid Tension Experiment I. Myself I never listen to the 2nd half of the disk. I simply can't! I'm not too keen of Train of Thought but I love Scenes from a Memory (which by the way has its own highs and lows). It's pretty much the same with Octavarium. Most of the time I simply skip to the last 2 tracks (the lows of this album to me is \\"I Walk Beside You\\", where DT sounds like a U2 tribute band; most of the other songs are not too bad, are just mainstream; this is what you get when there is too much LaBrie in the album). I thought to give this album a 5 stars simply because of the title song (Octavarium), a typical DT combination of a beautiful mixture of Pink Floyd and Genesis with their own mind blowing sound, but then it's a few minutes too long and (sorry) I still can't get past \\"I Walk Beside You\\".

6305609705|1.0|It is interesting to read the numerous positive reviews of Apocalypse Now, and certainly it will be to see reactions to this Review.  As a Vietnam veteran who spent almost seven years in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, it's difficult to be generous about the views of Martin Sheen, for example, who stated emphatically that this is \\"...the best Vietnam War film ever.\\"  Hardly!  If you evaluate the cinematic qualities of the film - for film's sake only, yes, it is a well-made film.  Other than that, and in terms of truth and realism, \\"surrealistic\\" about covers it.  In terms of reality and realism, even \\"The Siege of Firebase Gloria\\" - despite some terrible acting - was much better.<br /><br />The film presents scenarios that are not only surrealistic, they are virtually impossible, such as Kurtz' empire-building situation \\"up the river.\\"  As a former Green Beret, I am a little bothered by such portrayals, but I also realize that \\"opinions differ.\\"  This film is no better than a \\"1\\" on the scale of realism.
B000R4SMCW|3.0|This courtroom drama could have been called Hannibal Lite. Though nothing extraordinary, it's well done and enticing. Hopkins plays a brilliant engineer who, after brutally killing his adulterous wife, calmly waits for the police to arrest him. The cocky, young Deputy District Attorney (Ryan Gosling, in a fine performance as a quintessential yuppie) believes this would be an easy case to prosecute, but things don't turn out as expected, and a chilling battle of minds soon ensues. The denouement turns out to be quite disappointing (the filmmakers seem to believe that the audience would not stand a movie where the guilty get away with murder) but for most of its running time, this is a fine, well done thriller.
B000002GQG|5.0|It is hard to believe that this record is almost 40 years old, but it is.  And it couldn't have aged any better.  It still sounds as fresh, creative, and innovative as it did back in the day.  The seven-album run that the Moody Blues reeled off from 1967 to 1972 is quite stunning, and opinions are often all over the map as to what their best of those seven is, but in my mind, it is an easy question to answer.  With all due respect to the other six albums, all of which are excellent in their own way, as well, the answer for me will always be \\"In Search of the Lost Chord.\\"
B000GRUMPU|5.0|The reason to buy?  I never catch all the nuances of a story or the actors the first time around.  And buy only if you think you will like it!    I have always like the Poseidon story - I thoroughly enjoyed the different take of this movie and the characters.  Although I understood it better after going into the Special Features.    Josh Lucas was a great addition and of course I was interested because of Kurt Russell [who I loved in SOLDIER] not much dialogue there.  Richard Dreyfuss, I was curious to see how he has progressed from JAWS to ALWAYS to now.    And I am always fascinated on how they make a movie.  Wow! I have a great admiration for the actors and actress's who do a lot of their own stunts.  What they must go through to provide us with entertainment.  Especially the stunt men and women.  Seventy five shirts for Josh?    I like this description of the ship - \\"13-deck, 20 stories tall Poseidon as it shifts, lurches and implodes\\" - Yup! I was waiting for the darn thing to explode.    I had just got through watching \\"Mega Disasters\\" on History of these giant waves that can happen in the Atlantic and turn our coast lines into major disasters.  New York like another Venice.   I think a 150 foot \\"rogue\\" in the Atlantic with at least one ship a year being lost to one of these waves is hard to imagine - but a given fact.    Believe me you will enjoy this version of Poseidon without too much trouble - the characters are recognizable - the shots are great - the coloring definitely excellent - I missed the music for the action.    DEFINITELY RECOMMEND - for good clean action.
B000002J27|5.0|If you are just getting into Genesis and are looking for your first Collins -era Genesis CD, this is the album. Although Genesis lost a powerful creative force with the departure of Peter Gabriel in 1975, the 1976 album 'A Trick of The Tail' let the world know that Genesis could survive as a leading progressive rock band without the presence of its former lead singer and extravagant stage performer. From the opening lingering guitar notes on 'Dance On A Volcano' to the rhythmic pounding bass on the mainstay instrumental 'Los Endos', 'A Trick of The Tail' witholds much of the same artistic musicianship that was rampant throughout the band prior to Gabriel's departure. Phil Collins steps into the spotlight as the new lead vocalist while maintaining his post at the drum kit in the studio and on stage, as well during this time period. Sounding \\"more like Gabriel that Gabriel did\\" according to some, this was Collins' moment as he filled the lead spot. 'Entangled' features a brilliant mixture of layered acoustic guitars that blends into a climactic synthesizer-Mellotron solo with Mike Rutherford filling out the remainder of the sound spectrum with his bass pedals. The title track was also made into one of the first music videos the band ever produced. 'Ripples' is a beautiful song whose central theme is growing older. All in all, 'A Trick of The Tail' is a masterpiece that sums up the musicianship and talent of Phil, Mike, Steve, and Tony and in my opinion is the best Genesis album produced in the late 1970s after Gabriel left... and very well may be one of the best Genesis albums period.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|This is very welcome addition to the Pumpkins library.  I liked pretty much every song.  Anyone who says this doesn't sound like the pumpkins is smoking something.  It's a Smashing Pumpkins album all the way.  The songs are mostly upbeat, heavier numbers(no really heavy ones though)and they could easily fit in with songs on Siamese Dream or any album after it.  You get the feeling Corgan can write better songs in his sleep than most bands could in a studio.  It's good to have Billy Back on his throne, showing the kiddies how it's done.
B000002J1O|5.0|'Selling England By The Pound' is indeed a brilliant masterpiece from beginning to end, and is one of the finest albums produced from the progressive rock movement that swept the music scene in the 1970s. The album is \\"bookended\\" by the building rocker \\"Dancing With The Moonlit Knight\\" and \\"The Aisle of Plenty\\", a reprise of the opening track. \\"Selling England By The Pound\\" definitely has a medieval-English feel that holds its own charming presence throughout the entire album. The album starts out with Peter Gabriel a cappella, with Steve Hackett making his way in on guitar and Tony Banks making a powerful entrance on acoustic piano. Before you know it, you're smack-dab in the middle of a damn good, solid rock piece. \\"I Know What I Like\\" is a rather humorous take on an interpretation of the cover art (according the the album sleeve), and if you listen closely, you can hear Gabriel laughing as he sings through the second chorus. \\"Firth of Fifth\\" opens with a Banks piano solo, and is actually one of his shining moments as his excellent piano work is a central figure in the song. \\"More Fool Me\\" is one of the first songs to not feature Peter as the lead singer, and is an opportunity to hear a very young Phil Collins at the microphone as the lead vocalist. \\"The Battle of Epping Forest\\" is a progressive rock epic from start to finish- complex, lengthy lyrics, numerous tempo changes, not to mention clocking in at almost twelve minutes long. The song is a milestone for the band in that it proved Genesis could stand up to the other progressive rock bands of the time such as Yes and King Crimson. My personal favorite on the album is the diverse soundscape \\"The Cinema Show\\". The song begins with Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford on their 12-string guitars, picking their way through a beautiful intro after which Peter leads off with his unique style of sining about a modern day Romeo and Juliet... later in the song, a keyboard solo in the unusual 7/8 time performed by Banks signifies that the song isn't quite over yet and there's plenty left. I own many of Genesis' albums and this is one I continuously keep going back to-- it's Genesis at their best.

0316018953|3.0|The novel is short, i've finished it in 2 days. I thought the story was shallow. All the plot diversions about the Muslim terrorists and the handling of the radioactive substance were used in a vain effort to make the story a little more complex and/or interesting. Keep a short novel's review short, i am deeply disappointed in what was offered to us by Connelly.

B000P2A24W|4.0|Country music done Bon Jovi-style is something worth investing in. Though a lot of people feel that Bon Jovi has `sold out', the truth is that this is a very solid country-rock album, in the best sense of that term.<br /><br />Credit Jon Bon Jovi for knowing exactly what to do with the right tune. Every song here is a killer, and don't judge the album by the merits of the first single (as great as the song is). \\"Lost Highway\\" only suffers when it tends to get a little sappy for its' own good (the lyrics tend to veer toward Richard Marx territory every so often), but the core of the album screams `country'!<br /><br />The standout tracks are \\"Stranger\\" - a strangely successful duet with LeAnn Rimes, and \\"I Love this Town\\", where the boys sing to Nashville.<br /><br />Everything on this record just WORKS. Yes, its no `Slippery When Wet' or even `Blaze of Glory', but if you like tuning into an artists' evolution, then this is the album for you. Just can't go wrong.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|I first watched the video of Yanni -Live at acropolis and immediately felt in love with the music. The music he creates and the musicians he selects to perform it are both great and amazing. I searched but this video was not available in India.

B000RGSOR8|5.0|Before you sit down and listen to Annie Clark's (here known as St. Vincent) first solo album, \\"Marry Me,\\" take a moment to look at the cover. Think to yourself, \\"What kind of music could this woman actually make?\\" Chances are, every answer that comes into your head is going to be somewhat accurate. \\"Marry Me\\" is filled with the kind of quirky pop music that helped Regina Spektor and My Brightest Diamond get noticed. As it turns out, Clark also has the distinction of being a member of The Polyphonic Spree on their most recent album as well as a member of Sufjan Stephens' touring band (much like My Brightest Diamond's Shara Worden). While all these credentials are well and good, it is the music that matters most. Fortunately, \\"Marry Me\\" is probably the strongest female solo album to debut in 2007!<br /><br />The album starts off with the brilliantly composed \\"Now Now\\" in which a choir of childish vocals declare \\"You don't mean that, say you're sorry\\" just before Annie inserts \\"I'll make you sorry.\\" Perhaps the most impressive aspect of the song is the mere fact that Clark took care of most of the instrumentation herself, as she does through most of the album. While multi-instrumentalists are a dime a dozen these days, few are able to blend the individual parts together in a way that seems so cohesive.<br /><br />The humorously titled, \\"Jesus Saves, I Spend\\" features Christmas carol-esque \\"Bum bum bums\\" in the background, and even a few jingle bells for good measure. Here, Annie sings \\"While Jesus is saving, I'm spending all my grace on the rosy red power of lights on center stage\\" nonchalantly, adding to the carefree feel of the song almost as much as the floaty chipmunk vocals do (seriously). \\"Your Lips Are Red\\" takes a much more serious turn with a grinding guitar riff, haunting harp plucks and an incredibly eeire, yet undeniably cool string part. Clark's lyricism is once again displayed in full force as she near-growls \\"Your lips are red. My face is red from needing your red lips.\\" Eventually, the song builds into a much brighter affair where Clark sounds almost identical to Shara Worden.<br /><br />The title track \\"Marry Me\\" is another light pop song, this time sounding curiously like Feist. However, even amongst beat-keeping hand claps, the instrumentation is just as impressive as it has been. \\"Paris Is Burning\\" is absolutely amazing track, that finds Annie singing \\"I'm on your side where nobody is\\" over an almost waltz-like composition. The guitars here are absolutely brilliant, and the song is arguably one of the album's best. My personal favorite, however is the following track, \\"All My Stars Aligned.\\" Listening to it, I imagine being completely weightless, blowing about in the clouds. The song is so dreamlike, so perfect, that it's hard to imagine Clark ever topping it. She asks, \\"What was your question?\\" before affirming \\"Love is the answer.\\" Genius.<br /><br />The second half of the album is just as beautiful as the first. \\"The Apocalypse Song\\" is an absolutely gorgeous pop song whose heavy orchestration is only overshadowed by it's WTF-inducing breakdown. But Clark doesn't disappoint, bringing the chorus back for another go before ending the song. Amidst the rest of \\"Marry Me,\\" \\"We Put A Pearl In the Ground\\" seems entirely out of place. At just over a minute long, this simple, yet stunning piano solo doesn't really go with the string orchestration or guitars it follows. At the same time, however, it is undeniably charming, sounding like a heartbreaking lullaby. The song essentially serves as a prelude to \\"Land Mines,\\" but it completely outshines that song, in my opinion.<br /><br />The album wraps up with the quirky, yet catchy \\"Human Racing\\" and the completely charming \\"What Me Worry?\\" In it, Annie asks the question \\"Do I amuse you dear? Would you think me queer if while standing beside you, I opted instead to disappear?\\" It seems like no time at all before she does, and the album closes.<br /><br />Annie Clark hascompletely blown me away with \\"Marry Me.\\" This is not only the best female solo album of 2007, but one of the best I've heard in the last decade. At times she can sound like so many different artists (Norah Jones, Feist, My Brightest Diamond, Regina Spektor, etc.), but at the same time she maintains a uniqueness about her that is not only endearing, but entirely brilliant. St. Vincent is a name you'll want to remember, whether it's just a stage name or not. Listening to \\"Marry Me\\" is like opening your eyes to a brand new day and realizing that the world is full of possibilities. It is refreshing. It is amazing.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|With so many Disney DVDs to choose from, is \\"The Jungle Book,\\" even a new \\"Platinum\\" version, really a must buy?<br /><br />Absolutely. Just 78 minutes long, this unpretentious adventure is full of imaginative characters, charming song and dance routines, interesting themes and innocent good humor. Unlike many Disney films, \\"The Jungle Book\\" doesn't strive to be high art and has no groundbreaking special effects, but it's still one of the company's best animated films. And now the film has now been \\"digitally enhanced,\\" with a brighter contrast and cleaner colors.<br /><br />Telling the tale of Mowgli, a human boy brought up in the jungles of India, the movie is a freewheeling adaptation of some Victorian-era short stories by British writer Rudyard Kipling. Rescued as an infant by a protective panther named Bagheera, the boy is raised by wolves and adopted by a carefree bachelor bear, Baloo. Disney punches up the stories with Western jokes and music (the pop soundtrack includes Baloo's and orangutan King Louie's infectious scat duet \\"I Wanna Be Like You\\" and Baloo's perky prickly pear primer, \\"The Bear Necessities\\"), but wisely eliminates Kipling's patronizing overtones.<br /><br />\\"The Jungle Book\\" teaches children a number of good life lessons. It demonstrates that the world includes enemies as well as friends, and that enemies sometimes disguise themselves as friends. It argues that though its fun to pretend you're someone you're not, it's best to accept the person you are.<br /><br />It has two lessons about love. First, that true love is unselfish, as Baloo learns when he realizes he must finally return Mowgli to the \\"man village.\\" And second, as Mowgli realizes in the final scene, that the ultimate male fulfillment is the love of a good woman. Or, as my husband views the segment, the pursuit of a wide-eyed flirt.<br /><br />Parents can take note of a classic Disney touch: the acceptance of both religion and science. The film begins with the infant Mowgli lying in a basket along a riverbank, a reference to Moses that's not in the Kipling stories. Later, however, there's a nod to Darwin, as the orangutan King Louie greets the human boy with an outstretched hand, saying \\"Shake hands, cousin.\\"<br /><br />If nothing else, adults can enjoy identifying the distinctive character voices (Kaa is voiced by Sterling Holloway, the Cheshire Cat in \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" and best known as Winnie the Pooh) or laughing at the chorus of Beatle-like vultures. One looks just like Ringo. Sounds like him, too.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the story you may also want to check out Disney's live-action (and non-musical) version, 1994's [[ASIN:B00005T5YC Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book]]. Though it's a little violent for younger kids (one soldier is sucked under a pond of quicksand and dies a slow death), this PG film is not really scary and quite the exotic adventure. Its stars include Sam Neill and, in a bit part, John Cleese.ference to Moses that's not in the Kipling stories.

0143038419|4.0|Can you imagine having the luxury to travel for ONE WHOLE YEAR in search of pleasure, devotion, and balance?   Well--that's exactly what Elizabeth Gilbert does before she turns 35, and I am so envious I could die, die, die!     Of course, I'm not envious of her split with her husband, but the idea of being able to have the means to take off and find one's self is so delicious I can taste it.    In her quirky, smart, lavish pen---Gilbert brings the reader to Italy first-- Ohhhh--Rome; where she eats lovely, rich pasta and absorbs the Italian language like there's no tomorrow.     To eat - To study--To socialize...---My, it's like a kind of heaven on earth.      \\"I could make friends with the dead.\\" Gilbert admits.    And having this gift allows Gilbert to meet the most unusual, brilliant individuals, men and women alike who add beautifully and lusciously to the experience of her deep searching and hunger.     The \\"goons\\" as she so eloquently names them----follow her to Rome.  Isn't it interesting, that even being part of Rome's presence could not prevent depression from rearing its ugly, black, beastly head?  But it does-- and Gilbert deals with the beast as she deals with everything else----Head on.    One can observe the sassiness and coyote ugly (Yes, she was a coyote), uninhibited style of Gilbert's pen.  This----is what makes her a true women's writer; this is what makes her authentic and graspable and oh-so-lovable.    So, Gilbert travels to India and Indonesia as well---to discover devotion and prayer, stillness and solitude.  Elizabeth, did you need to go all the way to Bali to meditate? I am beginning to love and hate you at the same time!  How exotic!  How luminous!  I know God is everywhere, but I'm stuck in Minnesota!    One word Gilbert continues saying throughout the book is \\"Aurtravisiamo.\\"  In Italian it means \\"Crossing Over.\\"  Yes, she crosses over to the other side......    And in return the reader is presented with \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\"    Can we meetfor a glass of wine, Elizabeth?  I consider you one of my crazy, intelligent, outrageous, prayerful girlfriends after reading this book!    Aurtravisiamo!
B0001906O0|5.0|\\"Join the Dots\\" is a long overdue compilation from the post punk/goth pioneers.  This isn't really a surprising set, clearly being what it claims to be, a compilation of b sides and rarities.  Pretty much everything is here.  Only completists will previously have everything on here, which have been available on various singles, soundtracks, or collected on various bootleg compilations.    What is remarkable about this set is the quality of the output presented here.  Robert Smith's remarks in the opening of the liner notes strike a chord when he says he always hoped to hear another version of the band he was listening to at the time on the b side.  If your curious how a true a statement this is, listen to several tracks on the first disc, notably the Exploding Boy or A Few Hours After This to hear the Cure in full experimental mode, fooling around with a grandiose sound listeners would become more familiar with on later recordings.    There are many moments on here that find the Cure outshining the respective albums that these bsides support.  To the Sky is one of the most remarkable songs they've recorded while the Wild Mood Swings era bsides are better than anything off of that album.      This is overall a great set.  Aside from a few throaway remixes, it's solid.  The Cure are one of the few bands (along with the Pet Shop Boys and until recently Depeche Mode) who have put as much care into the b-sides as they would on the a-sides, really giving something extra to their fans.  Fantastic set.
B00009MGGI|5.0|What if Shakespeare's Lord and Lady Macbeth had been temporally transported into twenty-first century Britain? They would certainly be reincarnated into the insidious Francis Urquhart and his formidable spouse Elizabeth. In their new personae, 'MacUrquhart' would still be haunted by guilty visions but would shed any qualms about committing murder in the interests of power, and 'Lady MacUrquhart' would waste no more time sleepwalking but sustain her role as the actual but invisible control over the man with titular authority.<br /><br />The \\"House of Cards Trilogy,\\" which includes \\"To Play the King\\" and \\"Final Cut,\\" not only portrays such a ghastly scenario, but also demonstrates the disastrous consequences for a post-modern Britain when such a pair first insinuates itself into a position of power and then seizes and maintains an unrelenting grip on that power, even if, in the final analysis, it has to provoke a bloody war to do so. Thanks to Andrew Davies' darkly comedic script, Ian Richardson's brilliant portrayal of Francis, and a splendid supporting cast, the viewer is locked in suspense and held in a state somewhere between laughing and cringing at the political shenanigans, too many of which resound with an uncomfortable ring of contemporary probability.<br /><br />The humor derives from Richardson as Francis, who ruptures the invisible barrier between illusion and reality by taking the audience into his confidence. In \\"House of Cards\\" he does this with such wry wit that viewers are drawn easily into his thrall, so much so that despite their better natures and common sense, they find themselves liking and identifying with this charming unapologetic scoundrel. Somewhere in the middle of \\"To Play the King,\\" however, they realize, to their increasing horror, that by sharing in his most intimate thoughts, they have actually become co-conspirators in the machinations of Urquhart, who in a literal blink of the eye transforms congeniality into the mesmerizing malevolence of a king cobra. By the time they have become absorbed in the plot of \\"Final Cut,\\" they are inextricably tied to Urquhart's fate, as on a runaway train. Thus the scenario becomes metaphorical for the public's unfortunate propensity to be seduced by plausible but unscrupulous politicians who draw them into situations that they might not realize are unsupportable until it is too late. The repeated use in \\"To Play the King\\" of Urquhart's initials, F.U., illustrates this proposition.<br /><br />The late Ian Richardson's ability to keep the audience enthralled in the destiny of this despicable rogue testifies to his incomparable subtlety as an actor, who will be sorely missed. The lynchpin of the tale, Richardson is amply supported by an ensemble cast, including Diane Fletcher as his horrific wife; Colin Jeavens as Tim Stamper, his `whip' who wields 'a bit of stick'; Nicholas Grace as Stamper's toadying successor, Geoffrey Booza-Pitt; and Nick Brimble as the sinister Corder. Among Urquhart's memorable victims are Michael Kitchen as the well-meaning king, Susanna Harker as the unstable Mattie Storrin, Kitty Aldrich as the altruistic Sarah, to name only a few. All characters in this cautionary tale are vulnerable to the enticements of power, even those who begin as honest idealists. When Corder informs the nobly motivated Tom Makepeace, who eventually succeeds Urquhart as leader of the party, that \\"we\\"--meaning Corder, Elizabeth, and the rest--are \\"right behind\\" him, one understands the story's message that all politicians, even those with the best of motives, are liable to being corrupted absolutely by the acquisition of absolute power.cobra.

0156027321|5.0|An insistent, realistic tale. It may not make one believe in God necessarily, but through the eyes of a persuasive fictional teen, you will discover the meaning of true religion. A lively tale tailored with upmost care, the most detailed emotions in the most desperate situations.     The emotions could not have been described any clearer, the bitter hurts, the painful hopes, the senseless delusion. This tale will yank at your heartstrings when Pi loses what he needs most but still fights away the truth but the cleverly hidden humor will keep you from getting too down of heart.     A pleasant twist of fiction with the personified animals and ideas that could very well match a person's life: name-calling, sibling rivalry, over-protective parents etc. This novel is a must read for all ages, and you can read over and over without getting tired of it.
0316067598|5.0|This book holds a great story of what America goes through to help the rest of the world.  Even if we are not understood for all the things we do, there are still people like Marcus Luttrell who have gone through Hell and back in order to proactively provide security for the American way of life back home and to help people in countries run by terrorists.  This story is an eye opener to anyone who has not been involved in a war... or lost someone very close to them anywhere... What a great read and a deep look into life as a Navy Seal and U.S. Patriot!
0689865384|4.0|A searching book that asks the reader, \\"How much would I go through, how much would I give up, just to be like everybody else? Would I have the desperation to give up a friendship for an unnatural beauty?\\"       For Tally, the answer is yes; she does have the desperation to betray her friend, and one of the only ones she has ever known, using a shallow promise to another friend as an excuse for her actions. Little does she know that her perspective will change as she meets another, a special person who grips her attention.       One day as she tries to destroy it, she unintentionally sets off the tracker she had brought with her and ends up betraying not only her friend, but a whole society of people that she had grown to love. This book will add a bit of Technicolor to the usual drama.
6304884419|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies! My friend made me watch it and I wasn't too thrilled about it. I read the back of the case and thought it just wasn't my kind of movie. Totally wrong! This movie is pretty much amazing!!! Now all my friends have watched it and not one can say they didn't enjoy it. Watch it! I swear you'll like it!
B000FVQYYK|1.0|I bought this album because I went to a lyric site and their lyrics for a song on Absolution were insightful.  Once I received the album I was consumed with disappointment.  This world is suffering from the disease of delusion, religion is the opiate of the masses, and it is more destructive than heroin.  The ignorance of musicians spouting their idiotic rhetoric, which perpetuates the myths that god exists and we have souls is sickening.  Lyrics are a main component of music and musicians have to write lyrics that people can relate to in order to provide catharsis.  Hopefully this band will cease to exist so intelligent artists will thrive in our culture and challenge the ignorance that infects everything.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|If you had the opportunity to see Pink Floyd during the Pulse tour (Which I did!) then this DVD will take you back in time.  Although I enjoyed their \\"Delicate Sound Of Thunder\\" DVD- And yes, the DVD does exist and is a profesionally done recording, although you can only get it in PAL format, which means you'll either need an older DVD player or a multi region player to view it- it did not have all of the tracks from the concert I was looking for.  Pulse has both great sound quality and video, and I would highly recomend this DVD for any Pink Floyd fan.  It has impressed many of my friends who have never been able to see the band, and has allowed me and others who have seen them a wonderful chance to remember and reminisnse over the shows.  See you on the Dark Side...

B000J103PC|5.0|Like previous reviewers said, the directors did change the book around quite a bit, but I don't think it was necessarily a bad thing. If they had gone straight off the book, the movie would have dragged on and on, as the book does. Overall, the premise and conclusion of the story is kept.     Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway are a wonderful pair in this movie. Meryl plays the part of a cold boss wonderfully, while Anne is the adorable, yet ambitious nd frustrated assistant. The set and costumes are wonderfully put together, like a true fashion runway. It drops a lot of high-end, luxury goods' designers, but is still accessible to those that are not interested in high fashion.
0679736646|4.0|Ubik is a well-written and entertainingly comic read.  Ubik explores the borderline between life and death and purgatory and redemption.  However, after reading the book's conclusion, I'm not sure how meaningful the story is compared to some other PKD works that take a relatively more serious tone. This one will leave readers thinking that something is a bit lacking.  Nevertheless, Ubik doesn't take itself too seriously, and is a good change from all the excessively serious science fiction that seems to be written today. I just think that some of Dick's other works balanced seriousness with humor better.

This album though is quite possibly one of the best albums i've ever purchased. Across the board the album is strong, has different styles and tells amazing stories like Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (through hell). I don't know how they'll beat this!
B00005JPHT|5.0|I like this film because it did provide a real part of people's life and what could happen to anyone who does not have millions of dollors. He gave us examples from other counties that have better care than US.<br />First I agree that the HMO is not in the place to help us. they are not  trying to provide the best care as they have claimed with their ad.<br />Let me give you an example, if you want a hot dog, you could get it from a stand, It might cost you $2, or you could go to a food store, you might get a pack of 8 for $2. This is simple, You have cut the middle man who need to make a profit. If we cut this HMO profit, We might get better care for the same amount of money we spend. So we do not need to be afraid that HMO could go to another planet.<br />What we need to think about is how real can an universal health plan work here.<br />Lets just say that we have working library system, but we also have Amazon, Barnes&Noble, Borders...., If you need a book for free, first you have to check if your library has it, then you might have to wait for your turn. When you finally get that book, you need to return it on time, otherwise, you are fined. Do you know that you can not keep that book if you like it so much ? And you can not start a lawsuit against the library for not having something you want, or that you did not get it on time, you might be very very much distressed about this. People pay for their books all the time along using the library. People who has more money could live a better life and  get better treatment for lots of services than the poor. It is not right for any American to be hungry, but it is also not real for each of us to enjoy lobster every time we see someone's plate has a lobster.<br />Another example is our public school system, Are we having a functional one? How do we compare ours with other counties? And again,  Can parent start a lawsuit if their children fail their grade or did not get into the best college ?<br />Like we all deserve education, we all deserve basic healthcare. But we live in a very special thinking environment in this county that is totally different from other countries, and we are paying the price no one else is paying.  You pay for extra extra tests that are not needed, you pay for the malpractice and lawyers.<br />Think about it, we are crying loud for the skyrocketing cost of health care. Most people think that the cost of healthcare depends on doctors and nurses fee, if you do some investigation, the percentage of these fees has been dropping steadily for the past 20 years. Actually they only acount for a small percentage of overall cost. The New York Times reported 2006 that doctors' average pay, after adjusting for inflation, fell seven percent in the last eight years.  And your primary care doctor's income dropped by 10 percent.<br />I think that if we have a realistic target, we sure can get much better care than we have with these HMOs. But please do not think that we should get every advanced care for free.<br /> I still like this movie very much, it just let us know that we might do much better without being afraid that HMO would stop making millions out of US citizens.deserve basic healthcare.

B000OQF6N6|3.0|During my first perusal through  Zeitgeist, this thought came to mind, \\"Which album is this? Hasn't this been done before?\\" The sound is like 7  years never passed, classic wall of guitars and great drumming on Chamberlin's part. For hardcore fans, this album is sure to please, it reaches back and uses all the SP cliche' riffs and sound. Not that this is bad, but you'd think there would be a little growth in the sound that was hinted at in Machina'. Billy is still the wordsmith he has always been - progressing to more contemporary issues.  Now that the band is down to two with a couple of hired guns brought in to fill in, it reminds me of another duo of the past -Steely Dan. Their comeback album after 20 years or so was their classic sound as if time stood still for them, just like this album.
B000OLGCHA|3.0|I think Hooper is a step up from the dribble of GOF. Of course he is no John Williams (who should come back by the way) but I think he needs to be cut a break. I am not a collector of movie soundtracks though I do look them up from time to time. The only reason why I even looked up the Harry Potter soundtracks is because of Williams, and then when I heard Hooper's \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\" which I enjoyed immensely. He does his job as a composer which is to emphasize the scenes in the movie. \\"Umbridge Spoils a Beautiful Morning\\" is a good track considering it has that sugary sweetness quality with a paradoxical underlayer of uneasiness, discomfort, and something not so nice- just like the character of Dolores Umbridge herself. It is very fitting. As a soundtrack I think it works, despite the weird presence of a guitar in \\"Fireworks\\"....

It will help you recognize the downsides (and upsides) of whatever tempermental tendencies you bring to your learning and will help you get out of your own way.  At a time when the zeitgeist is to find a cookie cutter \\"sure fire\\" approach, the author calls us to return to wisdom and learn to grow through experiences, both the kinds we enjoy and those we hate.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Another intimate CD by one of the All-time great voices.  I enjoyed all the articles Pre-My December release and felt it added to the lyrics and the soulful songs.    Kelly can and does sing the heck out of every song .. especially if she has written it.
1594489505|5.0|This is one of those books that is painful to read, mostly because you grow to love the characters and want to know what is going to happen to them, even though you know it is going to hurt.<br /><br />The writing is beautiful and poetic, the character development is perfect.  The story itself is compelling and riveting and compared to The Kite Runner (which I loved), is even better.  Maybe I felt I could relate better because I am a woman, and this is clearly a woman's story, but all of these characters, male and female, even the ones you dislike, are so human.  This story knocks down the barriers between the world here that I know (in our very safe and secure country, the good ol' USA) and the haunting world they live in, Afghanistan, where every day in every decade seems to be scattered with hazards for everyone, all men, women and children.<br /><br />I couldn't help thinking of the haunting photograph of a young Afghani girl that graced the cover of National Geographic some 15 or 20 years back, and the search that ensued in the last few years to find her.  It was shocking to see the way she had aged, the ravages of war and daily life on her once gorgeous face.  She could be Laila.<br /><br />What can I say?  Hosseini's writing is superior.  The story telling, so very moving.  Get some tissues.  Be prepared to stay up all night.  Read this book.  Let your children read this book. It will have a profound impact on the way you view the world today.

6305882592|5.0|On the surface \\"Harold and Maude\\" may seem like a comedy, but it is much more. One of the most spiritual movies ever made. The entire message of the movie may be summed up by Maude's 5 (five) simple words to Harold in the ambulance: \\"Go and love some more.\\" It's that simple. I'll never forget the first time I saw this movie in the theatre in the 70's. I left a changed person. The music of Cat Stevens perfectly frames this movie. It wouldn't be the same without it. This is a movie that bears watching many times over many years. It never seems to run out of life lessons.  My favorite movie of all time. Watch, reflect and learn. \\"Go and love some more.\\"

0751532711|4.0|I am an avid reader. I am also an entrepreneur. I have read many self-help books. I find most of them kind of silly and useless. However, Rich Dad Poor Dad is inspiring.<br /><br />In this book, Robert Kiyosaki tells the story of two fathers, a poor teacher who is highly educated, and a rich, self taught millionaire with no college degree. He tells about how the rich man teaches him life lessons by driving the values of hard work and acquiring assets into his head. Kiyosaki is a superstar when it comes to motivational thought, so there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said; except for the fact that I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who hopes to improve his financial station in life.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />-Craig Nybo, co-author of [[ASIN:1425965180 Total Human: The Complete Strength Training System]]
0385522401|4.0|In this short novel, master tale-spinner Ian McEwan pulls together the stories of two young people embarking on adulthood at a time when youth is still considered a time best quickly shed.  McEwan characteristically explores the individual innermost thoughts of the couple on their wedding night, spent in a resort hotel on Chesil Beach in England, on the cusp of a more sexually-liberated era. He captures their anxieties, misconceptions and fears in a delicate and typically-English reserved way, with a touching, and ultimately regrettable, conclusion.  Perfect for summer reading, or a thunderstorm page-turner.  Highly recommended.
B000NA28A2|5.0|Quien no recuerda \\"Bachata Rosa\\", \\"Si Tu Te Vas\\" o \\"Mi PC\\"? Juan Luis Guerra forma parte integral del haber crecido en Hispanoamerica en los a&ntilde;os ochenta y noventa. Desde el cambio de siglo, no se sentia con la misma fuerza (o al menos no lo sentia YO con la misma fuerza), pero \\"La Llave De Mi Corazon\\" cambio todo de nuevo.<br /><br />Aunque el sonido del album recuerda a la mejor epoca del gigante genio de la musica Dominicana, el album refresca el ambiente, recordandole al mundo el nivel de genialidad de Juan Luis Guerra que logra a un mismo tiempo alborotarle a uno las ganas de bailar y de decirle \\"Te Amo\\" a la pareja. No hay cancion debil en el album, lo cual equivale a decir que no hay descanso para los fanaticos de Juan Luis a lo largo y ancho de los 13 tracks.<br /><br />Simplemente, sin lugar a duda, \\"La Llave De Mi Corazon\\" es el mejor album latino del a&ntilde;o 2007.
B000HEWEEY|1.0|who cares about a bunch of badly reproduced lobby cards? I do -- a little -- but would not pay 20 dollars for them not even if they are accompanied by a ludicrous plastic toy model of the famous, glorious, robot. Pretty disappointing. Go for the simple DVD and enojoy the film.
B000H0MKGK|2.0|I don't know what it is but I just can't get into this cd. I could only find 2 standout tracks, and that doesn't say much.
B0000AGWJ7|3.0|The \\"City of Evil\\" album was hardly out of my cd player since I bought it. I knew that \\"Waking the Fallen\\" would be different, but I was not expecting so *much* screaming. While a great many of the tracks are good and show snatches of their style and trademark sound later heard on COE, I could not enjoy WtF as much.     Let's face it - M.Shadows does not have a good singing voice. He is at his best when he's in his natural baritonic register, as exhibited in the early parts of \\"I won't see you tonight, part 1\\", but to growl and scream the words through the entire song, as he frequently does in \\"Reminissions\\" and \\"Desecrate through reverance\\", shows musical immaturity. It was just too much like \\"Bleeding Through\\" or \\"Atreyu\\" or maybe even \\"Slipknot\\" for my tastes. If the audience knew something of the words, it would be easier to appreciate. Who really wants to sit with the book of words and follow along? For my part, I was initially dissatisfied with this album. I knew, after the first listen, which tracks I should skip over, and also which ones I would be singing all day. And there were plenty of both.    That's not to say that it's a bad album. I gave it some time to grow on me, and now I like most of the tracks just fine, though I still skip over at least three of them. It's clearly a different style from their recent albums, but it keeps the tradition of hardcore rock going.    It is also worth pointing out that because City of Evil was so divergent from the roots, it makes total sense that A7X were called \\"sellouts\\" for giving in to lighter music. Listen to this album, then follow it with CoE, and you'll understand.
1400032717|4.0|After reading this book, I am convinced that Mark Haddon, the author of this book, is BRILLIANT!  Although I don't remember seeing it mentioned, the main character of this book, Christopher, seemed to exhibit a lot of the characteristics seen in people with Savant Syndrome, which I believe is a form of autism.  Mark Haddon does such an incredible job writing this book from the main character's perspective.  It will have you laughing as you follow (or try to follow) along with Christopher's thoughts from a \\"Rainman\\" perspective.  One minute he will be talking about his pet rat, then then next minute he will be discussing train schedules, constellations, or his aversion to brown and yellow.  I mean really, don't we all determine what kind of day we are going to have based on how many yellow or red cars we see in a row? lol.  The diagrams throughout the book add so much to the content.<br /><br />Although the premise of the book is to determine who killed the neighbor's dog with a garden fork, the reader is in for so much more than that!  This book is a \\"MUST- READ\\" for people who deal with autistic people on a regular basis. It really deals with the challenges of raising an autistic child, as well as the blessings they bring..... It will blow your mind how the writer \\"got into their brains\\" and wrote this masterpiece.  I don't know if Mark has written any more books, but I can assure you I will be looking for his next one!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is obviously wonderful... amazing.  However, be aware that even if you have an HD-TV, you cannot watch the HD-DVD unless you own an \\"HD\\" DVD player.  We had to return our originally ordered copy when we realized that and purchase the regular format.  Luckily, because I had read a review like this one, I realized this problem before I had opened the DVD.  Wish I had read it before purchase and that would have saved my making that mistake, thus my review.... Hope it helps someone!  The regular format is adequately amazing!
074356619X|5.0|I read with great amusement some of the negative reviews of this book.  As someone who has experienced daily results from using the Law of Attraction for the last two decades, using these principles to escape my own personal crisis and create the life of my dreams, I find it interesting that those who don't know a thing about it feel compelled to present themselves as experts.    Why not listen to someone who has actually used the \\"product\\"?    Would you put stock in someone's review of a blender they did not own and had never used, where their only experience of it was to read the instruction manual and decide the product was worthless?  Of course not.  But that's what these naysayers think you should do.  Don't be fooled!  They may have read the book, but it should be clear to everyone who reads their words that they have never put its teachings into practice.    These are the same people who think you are small, powerless, and wrong for wanting nice things in your life.  Of course that's not all you want - you want good health, love, joy, peace, and many other (for lack of a better word) things, but they apparently think it's immoral to also want a nice house and a large bank account.  That's hogwash and you know it!    The Secret is not \\"positive thinking\\", nor is it sitting around wishing you were rich or picturing a candy apple red Mercedes Benz convertible in your mind and finding it on your front lawn the next morning. It is deciding what you want and working with the Law of Attraction to manifest it, whether it's a loving relationship, a more fulfilling job, financial freedom, a healthy body, a peaceful home, or any number of experiences.    Working with the Law of Attraction does not mean closing your eyes and tapping your heels together three times.  It means using your thoughts about what you want, along with gratitude and desire, to generate inspired action.  Action is key, and The Secret makes that clear.  One way to invoke inspired action is by askingyourself: if you knew for sure and certain that you could have this thing or experience, what would your next step be?    Listen to the voice inside you that knows the truth...the one that has been trying to get your attention if you would only be still and listen.  No matter what anyone in this world tells you, you have the right and the power to create the life of your dreams.  You used to know that, but have forgotten it over the years as you came into contact with people who told you to \\"be realistic\\" or \\"stop dreaming\\" or \\"life is hard\\" or \\"you aren't smart or talented enough\\" or \\"you can't have that\\".    At the very least, you know that there are already millions of people successfully using the principles described in The Secret to draw into their lives the experiences and things they want, so why not you too?  Is it simple?  Yes.  Is it easy?  Not until you learn to work with the Law of Attraction and get in the flow of fulfilling your dreams. You've had a lifetime of going against the flow, so now it's time to learn how to turn around and use it to carry you to the places you most want to go.    The beauty is that this Universal law is working whether or not you believe it or are aware of it, so you may as well learn how to use it.  You have nothing to lose and everything to gain from learning from those who have chosen to teach it, and the teachers in The Secret are some of the best. Are there some hokey parts to the movie?  Yes!  But so what?  Get over it and focus on the rest.    Take advice from someone who actually uses the product every single day: The Secret offers an easily understood instruction manual for using the Law of Attraction.  What you do with the knowledge is completely up to you.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Aside from the well-deserved accolades for Mr. Smith, Sr, there are many things to like about this film. It was slow-moving, and after about an hour, it was established that this guy was having a tough time. One thing we noticed was the sensitivity and unconditional love for his son, and his very common sense approach to life at large without crippling the son's mind for life. The screenwriters are to be commended for adapting Chris  Gardner's auto-biography in a direct, matter-of-fact way. I thought the pairing of Mr. Smith and his son, Jaden, was fine (unlike others' opinions). I also thought that Thandie Newton played the wife with the utmost despair, a frustration that she simply couldn't deal with. I would like to know what ultimately happened to her, as well as the young son, now in his late 20's. The DVD had some good extras, especially about Mr. Gardner and his in-put during filming. My favorite element of the film is that it involved very little racism. Mr. Gardner never complained that his bad luck was due to \\"being Black\\", and instead used his wit, wisdom and intelligence to make a seemingly hopeless stuation work to his ultimate advantage. He's a fine role model for ALL people who think they're at the rope's end. It CAN be done, as Mr. Gardner proved, and there are valuable lessons here, for those who take the time to let them soak in. Indeed, the slow pace is deliberate, thanks to director Gabrielle Meccino. I think it was the bottom-line idea... watch, listen, learn, grow...
B000065BPB|5.0|I've been using my Sennheiser HD280Pro headphones for four years now. Headband is still in one piece, nothing is cracked, they travel perfectly, everything is still in good shape. I'm using them now and I use them often.    Perhaps those complaining about the quality just don't know how to take care of their stuff.

I'm also a mommy to a precious 2 year old daughter, Claire. Claire loves her books, and she adores this one, and has learned to chant diffrent parts of this book with me. It's one that both of us really enjoy!
0316067598|5.0|No joke...This book is riveting from start to finish. The heroism, integrity, and determination in the SEALs that fought in the mountains of Afghanistan is without compare. I only wish I could shake the hands of everyone of them, and thank them with everything in my heart. You will not be disappointed in this book, I absolutely couldn't put it down. If this is not turned into a movie it would be a shame, because it's more gripping than most fiction I've read. Only wish the people in this country that are calling for our retreat would read this first, to get a soldiers account of what they,the politicians, and the media are doing to the cause...
075640407X|5.0|I broke my own rule and bought a book knowing the sequels were not yet published. I just finished this book and I am very unhappy I cannot run out and get the next one. April seems a long way away.    This was a great book. It was exceptional. Quite simply it stands out amongst the many books in this genre I read every month. I believed it. The author creates a world and puts his characters in it and they fit. This is actually pretty rare. Not a great deal of time is spent on political or geographical background and it isn't needed. The world is revealed from the perspective of the main character. He visits a place and you see it and hear about it as he discovers it.    Really it's just a great book. I recommend it very highly. The pace of the story has drawn some complaints but I disagree. Thanks to the author for a great first book.
1594489505|4.0|It is clear that Khaled Hosseini has a deep love of his homeland, Afghanistan. Whereas The Kite Runner dealt with the relationship of two Afghani men, ...Suns is the emotional journey of two seemingly unrelated women. Obviously, then, I highly recommend this novel to women, although I enjoyed it immensely. By a series of unfortunate events, the women are brought together. I couldn't help an overwhelming sense of sympathy for the people of Afghanistan. Hosseini wants the reader to know the country of his childhood. He paints it as such a beautiful and mysterious time. War obviously ended all of that. I love how the author weaves into the plot a history lesson of the Russian invasion, the Mujahideen resistance and eventual civil war, and finally the rise and fall of the Taliban. All of this fighting not only killed and is killing the people of this land, but it also is killing the dreams and aspirations of its people. ...Suns is Hosseini's way of saying that, like its fictional characters, some in Afghanistan will not let their dreams die.
B00008BRB5|5.0|Obviously if you love the Police, you love this album! I bought this CD because I'm going to see them on tour in Philadelphia and I wanted to relive the 80's.  I only had the album on vinyl so I just had to purchase the CD to listen to it on the way to the concert.  I was upset when the Police broke up, but this album brought back those memories of going to see them in the 80's and just worshipping this band.

0634086782|4.0|This is a good look at a  rehashing of what has been, for a long time. Some authors are better at portraying certain subjects in better context than others. These 2 gentleman seem above the average! I like it, very much.    The biggest value of this  book though, is the fact that the great Jeff Bent was such a huge part in the authentication process.... I  personally am working on several learning methods for publication. It would be an honor to have Mr. Bernt give a look at my ciriculum  also. ( I probably mispelled that, thats why I need Jerf!!)    Anyway, good book. Nicely done!
B000G759LW|4.0|Honestly, I have only listened to 2/3 of the double album set, but I have enjoyed every minute of what I have heard. Christina is a little dynamo and she brings it full force. It is ashamed that so many of the tracks on this album will be lost in the over play of Candyman and Ain't No Other Man on the radio. If you like pop music, this is a great addition to the 2006/2007 year's collection.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|For 7 years, 7 months, and 7 days (well it turned out to be 10) he took his chances yeah... but now he can make a big come back 'cause he's good like that.
B000GRUS22|5.0|Well we are now in a new \\"age\\" for Enigma. The sounds are new and maybe the fans can't adapt easily.    Anyway i think this CD is beautiful, i like it a lot.
B000JRYOPG|5.0|This was Cess Silva's 1st film and it was a very good movie, it explores the life of two Jamaican childhood best friends who grew up dirt poor & raggedy in the slums of Kingston, Jamaica. The friends (Biggs & Wayne)shared common goals, and each wanted to be rich with money, power & respect and wouldn't stop until they got to the top and had the best life possible. The movie takes you on a roller coaster ride while it explores friendship, loyalty, ambition, crime, pain, love, deceit/betrayal and teaches you a lessons. The loyalty, love and respect Wayne, Biggs & Mad Max have for one another as friends is almost farfetched nowadays, no one got jealous of the other one, no hating or backstabbing, just true brotherly love. They were down for each other and fearless. At the end Biggs learned a painful lesson when his demons finally catch up to him and he has to pay in many ways that money nor fine luxuries can't buy. I'll admit it was an underground movie and leaves alot to be desired which may come if there's a sequel, but being this is the director's first movie, I give him 5 stars for effort and for the delectable eye candy (Kymani Marley & Spragga Benz). In his next effort I'm sure he'll have a plot and other essentials in a good movie.   This is a good movie and anyone from the hood, the Caribbean and  born African American can definately relate, I feel as though this movie is just as good as Scarface, The Godfather and Belly for that much, these rappers and artists that have no formal acting coaching did a superb job!
B00005JKHP|4.0|The first good thing about Star Trek I is the fact all of the actors are as close to the age that you remember them being in the original series as they can be.  The Shat's rug might look a little obvious, but he looks like Jim Kirk should look at this point in his career.  Nimoy and Kelly still look capable of saving the universe. Even Doohan is svelte in this one.<br /><br />The second good thing about Star Trek I is the Enterprise glamour shot.  Scotty and Kirk's lengthy flight around the refitted and cooler looking NCC-1701 makes it worth owning this DVD.<br /><br />The third thing about this movie is that it resets the stage for further adventures.  While not the best of the bunch, it wasn't the worst (that would be either III or V, depending on who you talk to).  Though lacking in specifics about where they actually drifted off to after the five year mission, this one brings them back into the same room and gets the ball rolling for the rest of the movies.  It's a rehashed original series episode, but like the old show, it tries to tell an interesting tale and make a few statements along the way.<br /><br />What's wrong with it?  Nothing says lazy writing like the overlong special effects shots of the Enterprise flying through the unknown entity.  And the dramatic conflict between the Enterprise's new, inexperienced Captain and Jim \\"I've saved the Universe a couple dozen times before you were born\\" Kirk that should have never occurred.  I mean really, at this point in Starfleet history, Kirk and his crew would have been interstellar heroes and celebrities, legends in their own day.  Captain Decker's whiney, insubordinate behavior is just there because this \\"G\\" rated movie didn't have enough dramatic conflict.<br /><br />Of the bunch, I'd say this is the fourth best of the films.  Wrath of Khan is the most fun, Voyage Home the coolest and funniest, and Undiscovered Country the closest to what the original series was trying to do.  But they wouldn't have been as good if it weren't for number one.umber one.
B000HBK3MM|3.0|Yup, I punned her name, but I really do like this album. Lets cut to the chase. It is a good album, and worth spending the money on.    Why did I only give it three stars? Well, Corinne has a bit of a girlie voice for my liking. It is beautiful, but lacks a mature quality that I may have trouble growing with down the road. There is a nice mix of music, and unlike some of the other guitar strumming chicks out there, there is at least one danceable tune (thank G*-).    If you like the Lilith Fair crowd of artist then Corinne Bailey Rea is a great fit. Honestly, I hope that I'm not seeing another Tracy Chapman. Tracy's first album was good, but what has she done for me lately (I love days like this).    Kevin
B000HEWEDK|5.0|This is a true classic of the earlier scientific fiction films.  It rates with \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still.\\"
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Maybe this is not the best Enigma CD, but i like it and it arrived in excellent conditions.
B000QEIORG|5.0|this is the cd that put the foo fighters on the map. they hadn't quite distinguished themselves as a rock band yet, so they were looking for an identity,and got one with this album. there are the popular songs like \\"my hero\\", and \\"monkey wrench\\", but there are great unknown songs like \\"hey johnny park\\" and \\"new way home\\" that really bring this album to life. and as if this album wasn't great enough ten years ago they re-released it with great b-sides as extras. \\"baker street\\" is a great cover and so is \\"down in the park.\\" \\"dear lover\\" is a nice love song, and \\"requiem\\" is a cool, trippy tune also. all in all the foo fighters put out an excellent album a decade ago, and made it even better with the re-release. get this cd if you remotely like the foo fighters. this is their best record.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I love Eureka.  I find the series to be witty, smart and refreshing. The characters are varied and unique.  Wish I could live in Eureka. º
B000EGCITG|4.0|First, I think Pink just has a raw power to her voice that so many of the other pop starts don't have. Second, she sets herself apart by having tracks with relevant topic, a couple of ballards and then tunes you can dance too. Lasly, she deserves at least music award nominations.
B000065DWH|5.0|I bought GOOD OLD BOYS when it first came out, being a fan from   hearing Newman's SAIL AWAY. This record helped me get through the   1970's (and beyond) when I moved back to the South. It helped to   keep things in perspective! One of my favorites of all time.    Really, I've turned more folks onto GOOD OLD BOYS. While a FEW didn't   GET IT, most folks were blown away by it. I've had it on record,   8-track, cassette, and now CD.    MARIE is one of the most tender songs ever written. LOUISIANA told of  the BIG STORM that wiped out the state in the 1930's - but this song   was a HEADS UP to all who listened - even more pointed post-Katrina.  GOOD OLD BOYS lays out the NORTH VS SOUTH (RACIST vs ENLIGHTENED) debate  with a clarity that no one would dare attempt to present except Newman.  A Wedding in Cherokee County is just plain GREAT! Back On My Feet Again  is one of my favorites due to it's EASTERN SHORE reference (my home).  I could go on about every song on this CD but I won't bore you. Just  go buy it and hear it for yourself - a true masterpiece!
B000HC2LI0|4.0|Its a beautiful set, the show is great, no problems to report.  I highly recommend the show, you need to see it though in progression, its hard to pick it up if you are joining it somewhere in the middle of the building plot of each season
B000OLGCHA|2.0|I found it mildly amusing that my first thought, prior to reading other reviews here, was \\"John Williams has clearly left the building.\\"  This score was adequate as filler for a movie, but lacked any of the charm and creativity that was evident in the soundtracks from the first three films.  In fact, elements from Mr. Williams' compositions have been used in this score as well.  Each listener will have different tastes.  For myself, I found 2 tracks to be something I would want to keep in my library, which is not really enough to warrant buying the CD.    If you are a hardcare Harry Potter fan, then this CD should also appeal to you.    This soundtrack can really be summed up as filler and music that is fit to listen to in an elevator.  Unlike Mr. Williams' scores, which have been played on classical music radio, this one will not.    In short:  Save your money.  Buy the individual tracks that you like, and the DVD when it is released.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|these is one of my Dads favorite movies he really enjoys it   he would rate these movie very high
B000056IKU|4.0|Quite the fun one. Im going to try to be as succinct as I can and not draw out the review or anything here, but Fur Immer got me listening. Although minimalistic on the skin, the deeper you get, the more you start hearing. Whether this is due to subtle instrumentation or just sounds playing with your ears, it is quite entertaining.  Some critique the \\"speed up slow down\\" tunes, but nonetheless its interesting to note the differences between the tracks. Its almost as if you are looking at the same picture from different angles, except you are looking at it with your ears. The distortions bring out peculiar visions thats for sure. And Super, is just, well. . .Super.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Simply ... Amazing!!!    Okay so I bought this cd the very first day it came out because I simply LOVE Kelly. She was amazing on Idol and is MY favorite idol so far. Her voice is simply beautiful and her first 2 cds I love. I heard this crap talk about Clive and her fighting and was scared to hear what she would put out, at first listen, I thought `damn this cd is just ok, I do like Breakaway better' but now after many listens, after listening 2 the beautiful lyrics, the nice melodies and her haunting voice, this cd is amazing! I cannot get enough of it, its in my car, on my desk at work, my ipod and next to me at night for bed.     Never Again- Love it- love the words- 5 out of 5 Stars  One Minute- Didn't love at first but I find myself singing along to it- 5/5  Hole-Same as OneMinute, this is currently the song on repeat- 5/5  Sober-LOVE it, amazing, haunting! 5/5  Don't Waste Your Time- Fun song, 4/5  Judas- Love it! Great lyrics great beat 5/5  Haunted- Never caught on but still a great song 4/5  Be Still- One of my favs! Just great! 5/5  Maybe-  Possibly my top 3, amazing! 5/5  How I Feel- Good song but not my fav I also find myself singing it when its not on 4/5  Yeah- Same as before, good song 4/5  Can I Have A Kiss- Love this song love the lyrics 5/5  Irvine- amazing! Just haunting- 5/5  Chivas- funny great her voice is amazing! 5/5    Buy the cd you will not be disappointed! BETTER, yes BETTER than Breakaway!  Kelly is one of the best today if not top 3 singers of the newer generation! Here to stay and I cannot wait for future music! Kelly is original, her voice is amazing and her songwriting is just as good! GO KELLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! COOL BEANS :)
B00005JPGO|5.0|I am not one to give a perfect review...for anything at all, ever.  I'm very harsh, if there is one tiny flaw, I'll find it.  I'm not saying this movie hasn't got a few of its little quirks, and things that can be improved.  But here's what I am saying: this is the best movie I have ever seen.
B000MGBSI0|5.0|I think that Melrose place is one of the best nighttime soap operas frm the 80's-its so cheesy its really fun to watch i rate these series very highly
B000E97Y6K|1.0|With any remake, comparisons to the original are inevitable, especially if the original happens to be a beloved classic generally regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. Basically, another remake of KING KONG is unnecessary. To its credit, the campy 1976 version didn't try to 'ape' the 1933 film, but totally updated the story to its own era. While the latest rehash was intended as an 'homage' to the original, it can't even stand on its own as an example of good filmmaking.   To start with, Peter Jackson's KING KONG did nothing new for movies so it won't be remembered as anything extraordinary 75 years from now. In order for that to happen, a film needs to stand out as different from others of its time and thus be worth talking about long after it came out. The original KONG accomplished this by setting new filmmaking standards in special effects, music scoring and sound recording. Everything comes together so seamlessly in the film that its merits can easily be taken for granted, and often are. KING KONG had huge relevance when it came out in 1933; Aside from revolutionizing the film industry, it depicted the Great Depression, something audiences identified with so strongly at the time, and it immortalized the Empire State Building, which was just erected in 1931 and hailed as the epitome of modern engineering and construction. In short, the film was made exactly when it would best have an impact in the world. Peter Jackson's remake will never achieve that kind of cultural significance because it's irrelevant from the outset. It doesn't speak for its time the way the original did and still does.   Greatness is largely measured by originality, and on that note Jackson's film is nothing more than a plagiarism of Merian C. Cooper's original concept. At least in the '76 Dino DeLaurentiis version there were no cheap rip-offs of dialogue and musical cues lifted from the original. This kind of borrowing/referring is lost on younger audiences unfamiliar with the original film, and only comes off as gushy overindulgence on Jackson's part.   I also got jaded very fast with all the repetitious CGI glitz I was bombarded with - Kong flies and bounces around with the speed and weightlesness of a Loony Tunes cartoon character. On the other hand, I never fail to marvel at the grittier, hands on visual effects of 1933 which combined stop-motion, glass paintings, full-scale and miniature rear projection, in-camera mattes, and optical printing. The overall results seem even more remarkable today, especially since that brand of genuine artistry has been replaced by generic, computer simulated effects. Jackson's Kong stretches his mouth too wide when he roars (a lousy roar by the way), and his face and body contort in that watery, exaggerated fashion that is characteristic of CGI in so many current films. It reminded me of the &#34;rubber hose&#34; style animation of old cartoons which I don't mind, and even like - in a cartoon that is. Here, instead of looking realistic it only comes off elastic. To say that the CGI is overdone in this digital blitz is putting it mildly; it goes beyond credibility because it's used to depict action that defies physical laws. Despite the way she's being swung and hurled around, Ann Darrow seems to possess the invulnerability of a superhero in a video game.   The other neat thing about the first film is that its story, clocking in at 100 minutes, is fool-proof at that running time; extend it to over three hours as Jackson did and it just doesn't work. It's the kind of story that should move briskly along without resorting to scene overkill, and Jackson just crosses that line way too often. Witness the excessive dinosaur fights, the senseless bug scenes, that ridiculous ice skating bit (a real eye roller - Kong turns into Bambi!), and the ponderous, outrageously over the top Empire State Building finale. For all its pretentions toward 'character development' and other contrivances, this remake manages to omit two of the original's key exciting sequences: Kong's rampage in the native village (what happened to Jackson's demonic looking natives anyway?) and his wrecking of the elevated train. The compromised result doesn't improve on the original, but emerges instead as a tedious, gluttonous opus with a juvenile reliance on sheer banality that tries to pass for 'emotional depth'.   Additionally, though it's set in the '30's, the remake is too self conscious and tries too hard to be politically correct, all of which is out of historical context with that era. If Jackson has issues with the way people behaved in the '30's then why did he set his film in that time when he's unwilling to portray it truthfully? His remake dilutes everything that gave the real 1933 KONG its honest, timeless charm.   As for the actors, they're no match for the original players who brought a classic quintessence (not the often misused term stereotype) to their roles. Naomi Watts doesn't look, act, nor scream (yes, the screaming's important too folks) as good as the innocent/sexy Fay Wray. Unlike Wray's iconic, stylized performance, Watts brings none of that larger than life quality, and her face is frozen in a stunned expression for most of the film. She's also a full ten years older than Wray was in her portrayal as Ann Darrow, who's supposed to be an ingenue. This part immortalized the original actress, whereas Watts, like Jessica Lange before her, is probably trying to live it down. The miscast Jack Black totally lacks the conviction and gusto with which Robert Armstrong imbued Carl Denham. Forget the forced Orson Welles allusions; Black's Denham doesn't even measure up to Ed Wood. The actor's throw-away dialogue delivery and smug, immature attitude dispels any credibility to his performance which can best be summed up as amateurish. In his ill-advisedly re-written role as Jack Driscoll, Adrien Brody looks bored and quite unsure of what's expected of him, walking through it all as though he'drather be doing another movie. Jeff Bridges at least tried to be convincing in the '76 version. In the original, Bruce Cabot played the part as it was called for - a tough, true to the era seaman who, like his rival Kong, is gradually softened by falling for Fay Wray. Kong himself isn't the hybrid, monster-ape as originally conceived in '33, but simply an actual, ho-hum gorilla. He also comes off as an unlikable grouch who isn't as gentle with Ann Darrow as the original Kong is.  The one 'performer' that's really showing off in this movie is Jackson's hyper-active camera, which is constantly gliding, swooping, and circling around like it's mounted on a carousel. It's all supposed to heighten drama and generate excitement - it doesn't. Like the relentless CGI, the camera acrobatics are so overwrought that they ultimately become meaningless, failing to achieve whatever effect the filmmakers intended.  Whereas the original KONG tells its story with vivid, no-nonsense clarity, Jackson's is convoluted with trivial subplots and secondary characters whom we don't need nor care to know about. All of that irrelevant elaboration only gets in the way of the narrative's main thrust.  A major climax is also mishandled: In the original theater sequence, Kong believes the photographers' flashes are hurting Ann, and this provides excellent motivation for him to break loose - the beast protecting his beauty. It sets up Kong's re-capture of Ann since he follows her out of the theater and sees her run into a hotel. In Jackson's version Ann Darrow isn't even at the theater (though her name appears on the marquee - go figure); instead she's substituted onstage by a stand-in who's participating in a mock native ceremony! Kong's motivation to escape is therefore not brought on by any feeling for Ann - he's just fed up in general. The sequence is further marred by cutting away from the theater and diverting our attention to some corny dribble about Ann's and Jack's personal problems. It interrupts the tension that should be mounting at this point in the film.  Most importantly, Jackson made a crucial narrative error: He changed the story of KING KONG into a more conventional version of &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34;. To understand why this was a mistake, we need to look at Merian C. Cooper's made up &#34;Old Arabian Proverb&#34; which opens the original film:  &#34;And the prophet said: 'And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And it stayed its hand from killing. And from that day, it was as one dead.'&#34;  In Jackson's remake, Carl Denham recites this proverb onstage at Kong's debut. However, it's not quite the same:  &#34;And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty. And beauty stayed his hand. And from that day forward, he was as one dead.&#34;  Note that in Cooper's original text it's beauty's face that stays the beast's hand. In other words, it's her physical beauty alone that touches his primitive heart, not anything she herself does. There's nothing in the proverb to suggest that she warms up to him, and the '33 film adheres to that premise. Jackson altered the proverb and hence the whole point of the story by having beauty play an active role in taming and nurturing the beast, just as in the fairy tale &#34;Beauty and the Beast&#34;. He confused Cooper's film with something else entirely, and spawned the &#34;it needed improvement&#34; myth about the original. There's nothing to improve. The '33 KING KONG is a downbeat tale not just because Kong dies, but because Ann Darrow rejects him and thereby unwittingly contributes to the tragedy. It's a classic fable of unrequited love. If it's changed, the whole story falls apart. This is why the final line, &#34;It was beauty killed the beast&#34; works perfectly in the original but seems forced and out of place in Jackson's remake. He would have done better to leave it out as was done in the '76 version which also had the girl make friends with Kong.  A story as fantastic as KING KONG needs a streamlined, unpretentious treatment for it all to click, and ultimately Jackson's version fails by trying to be something more when nothing more is necessary. That's okay though, because in the end it just further emphasizes the singular glory of the original KING KONG, and it's now safe to assume we won't be seeing any more vain attempts at trying to recapture that glory anew. (See my Amazon review of the original KING KONG).
0743454537|3.0|This book takes a wonderfully nuanced topic (cancer, donors, families) and drowns it in backstories, cliches, a cliff-hanging suspense.  Jodi Picoult switches from narrator to narrator so you get a sense of where every character is coming from, which is brilliant and necessary.  Unfortunately, two characters are given a voice and are utterly pointless: Julia and Campbell.  Who cares what her attorney and his ex-girlfriend's problems are?  They have no bearing on the story.  Why write the book with suspense?  Because the Da Vinci Code did well with it?  Please...  These glaring problems will destroy your enjoyment of the book.  The central story is Kate (leukemia-stricken older daughter), Anna (specifically designed genetic match younger sister), Jesse (non-genetic match older brother and therefore irrelevant to his parents), Sarah (doting mother who would do anything for her child), and Brian (troubled father who sees all sides).  These characters drive the story in a powerful way.  Lifted directly from the mess of the other story lines, it would've been a perfect book that made you think, feel, wonder, and speculate about your own lives and families...
B00005221M|5.0|This movie was very well done and had my attention from the beginning. I get all rapped up with tales of the frontier, the first wars, and relationships with new cultures the the first settlers faced as they moved west from the original colonies. I believe this film is not only a must see, but a must buy.
B000001F3C|5.0|Forgot what you know about Modern Day U2. Since they are still on top of the pop charts, I am sure that there is a younger fan base that might like some of their newer material. If you do, then there is no way that you shouldn't purchase \\"War\\" \\"War\\" is easily U2's best album. Even though \\"The Unforgetable Fire\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree\\" produced hit after hit, \\"War\\" is a different U2 then some are used to. This album is dark, and the Edge does some great guitar work (in which he seems absent for the more modern albums) If you aren't even into the band (which I am not, I just love this album) then I highly reccomend it. If you are a huge fan, and dont have this in your collection, you are missing their best material. ENJOY
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of the Bee Gees, although I grew up with their music and think they are amazing songwriters. My whole life, the Bee Gees have always had a song on the radio, so for me, they are part of my personal soundtrack. I picked up this DVD on a whim, and enjoyed it so much I think I watched it three times in one weekend. It's still in the player, ready to go again. Simply wonderful! Love them!
B00004W221|4.0|Charles S. Dutton's character didn't exist. In reality, The REAL Rudy reported that this character (and a couple others) were composites of people who inspired him and helped him throughout his life. Too, the ending isn't exactly the way it happened \\"in reality.\\" But then again this IS hollywood isn't it?<br /><br />What I can say is that Sean Astin takes the role of Rudy and makes it real! He BECOMES Rudy. I don't know how much he had a chance to interact with the real Rudy prior to doing the film but it is truly amazing to see how Astin's performance comes across. He's endearing, believable and lovable. This is, without a doubt, Astin's best performance ever. It's proof that he has great acting talent... Talent that has unfortunately not been tested on the level of Rudy since... well, since RUDY.<br /><br />I'm glad to see this movie out on DVD. it's one of the few that are musts for the lover of the sports film (a la Hoosiers). There are many films about sports and sports figures. There are many stories where David conquers Goliath... but there is only one Rudy!
B000OLGCHA|5.0|Unlike so many others, I find this is an excellent score, more than serving its purpose in fitting seamlessly with the film itself. I have been listening to it since I bought it, more than a dozen times already and find it highly enjoyable. I cannot understand people not hearing any magic in it, though, yes, for the most part it is darker and more mature. So was the story. I am thrilled that Yates and Hooper will continue. At this point I feel there needs to be some continuity in the final films, which will tend to play out like one long story.     Another Story absolutely captures the feel I got when I read the opening of OotP. The element of the oppressive heat and the lonely, mournful piano theme presenting the isolation that Harry is experiencing is painfully gorgeous and wistful and sets the tone for the entire film to perfection. I'm tempted to say it is my favorite track, but the more I listen the more \\"favorite tracks\\" I am beginning to have.    Another fine track would be Possession. Hooper, in my opinion, absolutely made this scene what it was on top of the fine acting and direction. I could not for the life of me, when reading it, figure out how they could accomplish this scene without it being too stereotypical of some cheesy horror film. Possession provides just the right underlying momentum, presenting Harry's pain, fear, his grief, and a climbing ultimate release as he realizes what he does have and what is more important than pain or death. I've seen the film 3 times, and each time I become misty, which is pretty unusual for me in any film. Listening to the track, I realize how much of that scene is painted right into the sound.    The extended syncopated section of the bass and cellos in Death of Sirius is another favorite spot. It is so reminiscent to me of a heart beating erratically in fright. It's urgent, pulsating, and totally conveys the drive of the scene.    I found elements of GoF's themes here that worked wonderfully. GoF was like a breathof fresh air to me after listening to JW's first two scores which were suitable for the children's stories the films portrayed, but little else and the PoA's score, which worked hard, had maybe two interesting tracks, but fell far short of the beauty of the film itself. Hooper continues to use a lush pallet and adds some surprising rhythmic elements I love. His work added an underlying urgency that subtly enhanced the tone of the film.     I will be sorely disappointed if they go back to John Williams to score the last film because he is SO busy that little of his music sounds fresh at all anymore. Kudos to Nicholas Hooper. There isn't a track on this score that I don't enjoy for its texture, mood and function.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This is simply one of the quintessential rock efforts ever produced by mankind.  Marking the 3rd album of a reunited Iron Maiden and comprising what are arguably 6 of rock's best musicians in history, the band has capitalized on each other's capabilities to create a truly stellar work.  If you ever wondered what contribution a great singer could make to rock music; if you ever strained to hear a bass rythym; if you ever started the song over when the guitar solo came up; or if you ever thought Ginger Baker's \\"double bass\\" was as good as it gets, you need to start retheorizing your \\"Rock Philosophy\\" right now.  Iron Maiden's on-again/off-again efforts throughout the '80s/'90s do \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\" no justice and furthermore should NOT be used as a yardstick for their 21st Century accomplishments.  Listen to \\"A Matter of Life and Death,\\" and you'll agree:  it takes 6 Englishmen to make perfect rock music (and I'm American!).  My English/Poetry PhD mom even gave the lyrics a hearty \\"thumbs-up.\\"  I defy any rock fan to name a better, more important album in the past 4 decades--if you think you can, you need to go back to school.

1400032717|5.0|It's no wonder why this book is a national bestseller and belongs on the shelf of classics right next to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and \\"Catch-22.\\" At first, it may seem that this book is weird, possibly even different. What it is is a Coming of age story disguised as a mystery. Christopher, the main character, is writing a book about solving the murder of his neighbors' dog. But it is much more than that. What I can tell you doesn't begin to describe the infatuation and addiction that will come with owning this classic. The main character, though autistic, still portrays a very intelligent, very logical and interesting character. All the chapter numbers are prime numbers, each chapter is short, sweet, and to a hilarious point, there are some random facts and puzzles dispalyed throughout and it even incorporates drama. What you have is a story that will not let go. When I first sat down with this book, I devoured a good 28 pages in one sitting. After you finish it, you'll wanna read it again.
0060853980|5.0|This book is so goofy. The writing is smooth. I love it. I often loan it out to people. I think that is why my copy is missing. This is a must read.
0374105235|5.0|A must read! Not only for the eye-opening and anguishing description of the horror that has/is going on in Sierra Leone, but also for the incredibly beautiful details of family life in a rural part of an African country.  I am very thankful Ishmael Beah wrote this book and that my son (11) and I were able to read and learn through it.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|This movie left me speechless. Most people here are not learned enough to catch the really deep timeless themes running throughout this movie that are necessary to make a movie truly great. This is an adaptation of Goethes classsic, acclaimed Faust story. It is an allegory and a great story. I had goosebumps throughout. If you are a comic garbage fan you may not like it, but if you like truly great stories and classic themes, this is a movie for you. I think it attracted a lot of people expecting something superficial and just action-oriented. They did not get it and did not like it. Like kids evaluating a video game based on graphics... Chess has no graphics in their minds, but takes a lifetime to master. One of the great games of all time. So is this movie to these modern superficial people. I am making this review in the hopes that intellectual and intelligent people go see it because it will really speak to them. It is not a kids movie.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|Speaking from experience, opera buffs are the most passionate, opinionated, fanatical, divisive and stubborn people you'll ever meet. An opera production or a singer that some exult and will die for, others hate to the core! And that's good and exciting, hoping it will never stop. This experience is validated by the reviewers and commentaries made of Le Nozze di Figaro, the 2006 Salzubrg DVD of the Vienna State opera. Almost equally divided, some hated it and some love it. Out of nine reviewers, four gave it five stars and five one or two. For various reasons, both groups are right from their own perspective. I ordered this DVD on the stregth of Netrebko and D'Argangelo, two of the most electrifying opera superstars of today. Any regerets? After I played it, absolutely none!  Some purists were incensed with with Harnoncourt's slow tempo. So what's new? Two of the most-sought-after conductors of operatic and symphonic music- no names please- have been panned by critics for tampering with tempo- slow or fast. Some found the period staging of this production dull and monochromatic. Here it is how I see it:  Opera is a dying art. The average age of the Met Opera attendee is sixty or older. Opera productions have to become more relevant, even if it means that you have to get by without boudoir decors, brocade gowns and puffed-up wigs, so be it, as long a the music and the message are not compromised. Singers have to become less stilted and more annimated, interacting with each other. Mondernizing oprea productions- some call it Eurotrash- may be the only way to save the art and attract new opera lovers. The only problem is that in order to succed in modernizing opera staging, you need singers and actors of the highest caliber possible, for they're contantly exposed, and there's no place for them to hide. All singers, especially Netrebko (Suzanna), D'Argangelo (Figaro),Roschmann (La Contessa,)and Schafer (Cherubino) sang and acted superbly, taking this production to a higher level of theatricality, traditions amd musical interpretive syle notwithstanding. After all, opera was founded on theatrical principles inspired by Greek playwiters, dramatoutrgic and comic alike. Without hesitation, but regrtetfully so, I'll give this DVD five stars for six are not allowed!     Constantine A. Papas  El Paso, Texas
B000244FDW|5.0|This series is a gem, pre-Rebecca Eaton.  None of those Cliff Notes versions of the classics.  The story is given enough time to develop characters and plot line, and captures the wit and intelligence of the author.    This series is well acted and directed, and I think holds its own even next to the A&E version.
0393061310|5.0|I found that this book was very well written and is an excellent introduction to the subject matter.  The author is able to explain the big ideas in terms which are easy to understand for lay people like myself.    I was not able to put this book down after I started to read it.  If you do not know anything about human development I would recommend this book as the place to begin your studies.
B00005LC1H|5.0|The only thing I can add to the already lengthy reviews on this set is a warning.  It was written a long time ago, and there is dialog that might offend tender ears, and the sensibilities of modern race relations.    A few very mild swear words are sprinkled about, not terrible ones, but not for the easily offended or young.    The warning I would add is that the old Major is very, very politically incorrect, and was even for his time.  I think the writers meant for us to be jolted by his language, and weren't condoning his racisim.  I'd watched this series over and over on PBS where the offending remarks had been deleted out, and never missed.
0634022296|5.0|Not unfond of the Beatles, I play/sing-along a couple of songs from this book almost everyday (usually on the piano, sometimes on the guitar), and have very few complaints (other mainly than that it is a **tch to keep this open to the right page while playing).  The chords are usually right, although many of the older songs with only one or two chords per verse might require more than just chords to sound adequately good, and the book often groups chord progressions into a single chord (e.g. a line ending with E, E, E, E7, E7 may be listed only as E7); both of these shortcomings are easily overcome with a little adjustment/experimentation.   Also worth mentioning is the misabecedarian placement of I am the Walrus between Her Majesty and Here Comes the Sun.  The binding really is annoying - I really might finish ripping it apart and add rings.

0385333846|5.0|Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed in a hail of heavenly fire and brimstone. The reasoning was simple. According to the Bible, the inhabitants were vile and inexorable. So why did Dresden, a gem of Europe, perish along with its 130,000 inhabitants? Vonnegut investigates the purpose for the bombing of Dresden in a satirical allegorical manner that is unrivaled by any author since Mark Twain. Vonnegut shares Twain's genius for describing a situation simultaneously as comic and grave. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut is able to describe the German concentration camps with the morbid clarity of Elie Wiesel's Night. However, he juxtaposes human tragedy with ripping one liners. How does he get away with such irreverence without coming off as a complete jerk? That's the genius of Vonnegut.<br /><br />The book is structured in the quintessential style of Vonnegut's mid career novels. Each chapter is comprised of small, digestible vignettes ending with a joke or one-liner. This manner makes his novels easy to digest, like the sugar over the bitter pill. However, reflection over what was said is emotional on a visceral level. In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut takes on all the sacred cows: money, Christianity, nationalism, sanity and, of course, war. Each is presented to its most absurd extent.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim, the unheroic hero, involuntarily follows a convoluted story line that is a combination of recollection, psychotic episode and dream sequence. The story starts with Billy being \\"unstuck in time\\" and the story sequence loosely linear within ongoing backtracks and foresights. A perverse kind of black humor prevails in most scenes. For example, the only time Billy Pilgrim laughs during the novel is when he is being beaten by a fellow American soldier in the solitude of the Luxemburg frontier. The two had been abandoned behind enemy lines; one for his petulance and the other for his incompetence. Both outlive their abandoners. Throughout the novel, life is fragile, death is capricious and events are immutable.<br /><br />In keeping a promise to a war buddy's wife, Vonnegut portrays Billy Pilgrim as a \\"ludicrous waif\\" and antithesis of John Wayne or Frank Sinatra. He is unglamorous and pitiful. Through mental illness, a plane crash, and the destruction of Dresden, he just wants to die.  Billy Pilgrim is the one who wants to be left behind, but he keeps surviving when all around him die. Absurd.<br /><br />For Vonnegut, war seems analogous to the namesake of the book's subtitle, The Children's Crusade, described by Vonnegut in Chapter One. Under the auspice of serving Christianity in Palestine, The Children's Crusade occurred in 1213 when several monks recruited 30,0000 children to be killed or sold into slavery in North Africa. Regarding the Children's Crusade, the presiding Pope of the time, Innocent the Third, was cited with the following remark regarding the deaths of the 30,000 children: \\"These children are awake while we are asleep.\\" What is the significance of The Children's Crusade to the World War II? Most telling is Vonnegut's repeated restatement of the quatrain from the Christmas carol \\"Silent Night:\\" \\"The cattle are lowing, The Baby awakes. But the little Lord Jesus no crying he makes.\\" Although not explicitly stated, one has to wonder to the extent that Vonnegut finds Christianity to be a mitigating factor in the deceit (especially self-deception) that he attributes much of the bigotry and hatred in the world that leads to war. If not guilty by fault, Christianity is guilty by negligence. Where was Jesus? No crying he makes.us and events are immutable.

0393061310|4.0|Simply put this is a clever book by an intelligent writer.  The essential thesis is that those civilizations who first domesticated plants and animals got a jump on developing technology and immunity to deadly germs.  This gave them an enormous advantage which resulted in the propogation of their way of life and dominance over other less technologically developed cultures.<br /><br />Diamond backs up his thesis with observation and an excellent understanding of a variety of disciplines including:  history, anthropology, medicine, sociology, biology, evolutionary biology etc etc...<br /><br />This is the type of book that raises the conscientiousness of the reader but it is not without its problems.<br /><br />Many of the observations in the book are intelligent and logical, however much of what he purports is highly subjective, not testable and are examples of logical fallacies.  Therefore the book amounts to a number of untestable hypothesis and is highly subjective.  This does not stop the book from being wildly entertaining.<br /><br />2 of the logical fallacies consistently made are ad hoc (after-the-fact-explanations) and false cause fallacies.  In other words if event A follows event B then A must cause B or A could cause B.  To the authors credit he does reference this in the epilogue by stating that it isn't like other sciences where one can perform experiments.<br /><br />Either way this is an excellent book with interesting theories which makes an excellent topic of conversation.  Jared Diamond has an incredible penchant for making these subjects fun, I highly suggest this and other books he has written.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I like to keep things simple. So this will be short and simple.    I really like this album. I am a longtime DT fan and was disappointed by their last album \\"Octavarium\\", so I had really high hopes for this and I was not disappointed. I really enjoy listening to this whole album. And the 5.1 versions on the DVD sound phenomenal if you have a decent stereo system.    I rate this album the best since \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" as a whole. But there are songs on both \\"Train Of Thought\\" and \\"Six Degrees...\\" that I like better than any song on \\"Systematic Chaos\\", but this album as a whole is slightly better than those as a whole in my opinion.    I have listened to the newest albums by SymhonyX and Porcupine Tree and I don't like either. Currently, I do like \\"Ghost Opera\\" by Kamalot. I am also listening to \\"Black Rain\\" by Ozzy and \\"United Abominations\\" by Megadeth.    Scott
B000JBXXZ4|3.0|The first half of this album is great. Exactly the sort of catchy songs that you'd expect from them. \\"A Kiss to Send Us Off\\" is a strong opening track, \\"Dig\\" explores the territory of previous hit \\"Drive\\", \\"Anna Molly\\" is the standout track on the album, with a clever play on words, and \\"Love Hurts\\" is an excellent ballad. There are a few more songs that I thought were pretty good, but the rest of the album seems like weak B-side material. Corny song names like \\"Oil & Water\\" and \\"Diamonds and Coal\\" don't help either.   I think Incubus is a great band, but they should have waited until they had a full album of above average songs before releasing it. As it stands, I give the first half a 4.5, and the second a 2.5. Check out the songs first before buying, and maybe you'll like the whole thing, what do I know? But I think most will agree that there are only 5 good songs on here.
0393061434|3.0|The story Woz is telling is engaging and makes iWoz a very enjoyable read, but the structure of the book itself and the method of telling his story just feels like it's either being told to an eight year old or it feels like the author needs to write the subject down to a very basic level. iWoz is filled with phrases like, \\"I was so proud,\\" \\"We were so excited,\\" and \\"I was very excited.\\" Even I feel redundant and excessive just mentioning it but I'm not exaggerating to say that nearly every topic includes several statements like this. As other reviews have said, it doesn't take long - only a few paragraphs - to feel like Woz is bragging and the book is just an expression of ego.    If you can look over this, it is an entertaining overview of his life as an engineer, the early days of personal computing and the beginnings of Apple.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I consider Make Yourself and SCIENCE to be superior to this album, but this album contains three of my 10 favorite songs by them: \\"Nice to Know You\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Warning\\".  So this album is no slouch. I actually enjoy this one straight through, just as with the previous albums I mentioned. \\"Just A Phase\\" is a really cool song, too, but some of the stuff on here is more experimental, so not everyone is going to get into it as much as a die-hard fan would. It is kind of hit or miss with me. To me, Incubus has kind of faltered on the two albums that follow this, so I recommend their earlier stuff up until this one, and if you enjoy the more experimental side of them, then pick up their new ones too.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|CASINO ROYALE is the best James Bond film since ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE was the last film that was truly based on Ian Fleming's novel. Now comes CASINO ROYALE. This is an outstanding adaptation of Ian Fleming's book. Daniel Craig returns Bond to the no nonsense character that we last saw in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE. CASINO ROYALE along with ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and DR. NO are the best Bond films of the series.
B0000057C5|4.0|A new Rammstein album is always a refreshing change of pace from all the regular stuff that is released in a given year. This album is probably my favorite, as it has the best heavy/softer ratio. It also has their most popular song, \\"Du Hast\\", but the entire album can be listened to without skipping songs. It is great for when you want to do some headbanging and sounds great thumping out of your stereo. The fact that they sing 99 % of the time in German might turn you off, but there is no denying that these guys are very talented musicians and they have carved out a niche for themselves in the heavy music scene. The sound quality is excellent. Very good production.
B0007LXPBI|5.0|This movie makes even grown up's laugh. It is a great movie to watch as a family. It is a movie filled with comedy, excitement and joy.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|If you like mantras and Hindu culture you will love this cd.  It´s very good if you need moments of peace and meditation.
B00065MDRW|5.0|The debut album of King Crimson is one of their finest (though not their best; see [[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red]] if you want their top recording). This is the only Crimson album that features Greg Lake (of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer fame) on lead vocals. Although there are only five tracks, each one is rather lengthy and showcases the hallmarks of progressive rock as a whole.    My favorite two tracks are 21st Century Schizoid Man and The Court of the Crimson King, the first and last tracks respectively. Both are epic progressive songs, and are essential for any progressive rock fan; well worth the price of admission for this album.
B000092ZYX|4.0|I dont know what else to say that will add to the other 999 reviews submitted for this disc.  Its great, just not as great as OK computer or Kid A or even Amnesiac.  I like this one better than The Bends though.  Start with those three.  If you like them then get this one.
B00065MDSG|5.0|Larks Tongues in Aspic is the third King Crimson album you should buy ([[ASIN:B00065MDSQ Red]] and [[ASIN:B00065MDRW In the Court of the Crimson King]] should be your first and second purchase, in that order). This album features the classic Crimson tune \\"Easy Money,\\" as well as the two part \\"Larks Tongues in Aspic.\\" Like most Crimson albums, each track is rather lengthy, with the exception of the short (2:56) \\"Book of Saturdays.\\" This can only be a good thing, since there's more music to love. I highly recommend this album for any progressive rock fan, or for anyone exploring the King Crimson experience.
1563890119|3.0|I had no previous exposure to Sandman and little to graphic novels when I picked this up on my brother's recommendation and didn't put it down again until I turned the last page. The story, in brief, is that an old magician seeks to trap the personification of death and accidentally captures another eternal being instead: Dream. Dream eventually escapes and seeks to regain the tools of his trade, taken from him in captivity. In the process, he must challenge a number of unsavory characters.    The art is good, and the dialogue is easier to follow than some graphic novels because Dream's dialogue bubbles are in a different color from everyone else's. Gaiman introduces all sorts of clever ideas: we meet Cain and Abel, werewolf-like brothers who live in a house where Cain occasionally kills Abel, who always manages to crawl back; Martian Manhunter, a superhero member of the Justice League; and Lucifer, who no longer rules Hell on his own but in committee with two partners.    Dream's quest for his tools and his position provide a canvas on which Gaiman paints depravity, mercy, disillusionment, and a host of other virtues, vices, and experiences. Every page intrigues.    [Cautionary note: This graphic novel has brief nudity, some violence, and several gross-looking characters.]
B00007KWHG|5.0|Every song on this CD is great especially after seeing Jersey Boys you will be listening to this CD over and over again. I highly recommened it.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I was net-surfing for a CD I would like to buy on Amazon, and 5 stars customer reviews cought my attention.  I listened all free-sample songs and felt in love with her album.  Next day I rushed to a CD store and bought this album.  I can tell you all that I love every single of her song in the album \\"Little Voice\\".  She is so talented artist.  Lyrics and sounds perfectly harmonized and made each song so cool.  She will not make all of you disappointed.  Strongly recommended!
0374105235|5.0|I loved this book. I usually don't like to read books that are not science fiction, but for an English book report we had to read a biography or autobiography. i was on here looking for a book and I seen this one. I read this book in a total time of 5 hours because everytime i would start to read it I could'nt put it down. I was so touched by this story. The problem of child soldiers in wars is getting worse and it is a serious problem and people need to start to face reality and realize that it is real. After I read this book I started to do research on the diamond war and other civil wars in Africa. I actually cried while I was reading this book too. If you want a touching, amazing, sad and true story to read I highly reccomend this book.
0316018953|2.0|have read several of michael connellys' books -- enjoyed them all very much -- this one however i could not get 100 pages into -- plot stinks, dialogue weak, it is just a lousy book -- to put all my cards on the table -- am a medical radiation physicist by profession -- we finally get a book written about what we do and it stinks -- probably part of my let down -- pass on this one -- i know his next will be better
B000QUCNP4|1.0|Zodiac lovers beware! This bare-bones release (not bad in itself, mind you) only offers a few previews as extra features - okay, no big deal so far, but wait! The very first of those is none other than the preview... of the forthcoming 2-disc Extended Director's Cut loaded with extras, interviews, commentaries and tons of groovy stuff, to be relased next year. In other words, the first thing you get when you play this DVD is a very clear message that you have just been buying the wrong DVD. Now how's that for cynical?    On second thoughts, one could argue that it's not really better to get that kind of information only several months later when the Extended Cut or Special Edition comes out with little advance notice - and you find you have to fork out(much)more money to buy the same movie yet once more...
B000NVIXDW|5.0|i was so impressed by the service provided through amazon.  you people create a loyalty that will make the business last for a long time to come.  thank you for what you have done to create trust in me.
B00005JPKE|5.0|This is not the Best movie ever made. This is not the Worst Film EVER made. It is not Eastwoods best or worst. So what if this film \\"shows soldiers unfairly killing captives\\". Come on folks...<br /><br />People are strange.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima, and this is the first time I say this Cliche in 9 years of reviewing: is unflinching. There are times when you wish the camera would leave a little more to the imagination, sure, but war is brutal. This film is brutal. But, it is nice to see a film that has not become \\"pearlharborized\\" and suggestive.<br /><br />The center of the plot in one sentence: The Japanese side of Iwo Jima. I'll tell you what though, there is a lot to it. I left both this film and Flags with a greater appreciation of the men on both sides. Also, a greater understanding of the rediculousness of it all. I mean, as far as some of the ideology of the soldiers. Stepping on toes is a thing of mine. Ofcourse, theologically, we have the benefit of hindsight. Blah.<br /><br />Are there problems with the movie? Yeah. Are there problems with Citizen Kane and Fargo? Yeah. (grrr...afi) Some of the problems, as aforementioned by some, was the lack of display of the 20,000 Japanese. Ofcourse if history tells us that the soldiers were always scattered across the island, in caves etc..., one sweeping shot of massive bunched hordes would be an unfaithful recount.<br /><br />Side Note: The Acting is Brilliant.<br /><br />I don't know. There are many people willing to repeat over and over all those little details that apparently MANY feel obligated to restate, but not I. I loved the movie, but this is a rant, and it's done. ~Sir Adam of Scots~
0374105235|5.0|As a teacher-Social Justice and the lives of people who come to this country, these issues need to be considered by teachers of ESL students (all students). This boy went through so much and survived fairly normal with support and recovery time. What a story he had! Read this book!!<br />Not for Middle School Kids!
B00005JO5L|2.0|I think the controversy was alot of hype. I thought so when I saw it back in 1980. Visually its very well done, but unfortunately in makes no sence.    However, it has an absolutely killer soundtrack. If you can get your hands on it (and it isn't easy) by all means do. Willie DeVille, the Germs, The Cripples, Muttiny, Rough Trade, Madelyn Von Ritz, John Hyatt (before he got all down-home and nice).  Down and dirty gritty punk heaven. Definitely at the top of my list of favorite albums.
0689835604|5.0|My 18 month old daughter loves this book. She is fascinated with her belly and bellybutton, so the subject matter is most appropriate. She also loves that it is an interactive book in which she can participate. She loves lifting the flaps and acting surprised with the result each time. We read this book and the other books from this series daily. I highly recommend all of them.
1844137864|5.0|Banksy is a political artist who has created pieces from the thought-provoking to the amusing, and usually somewhere in between. This book is complete with wonderful photos of his pieces, his own little quips and insights into his background and what inspires him.    I really liked this book, and I am not a fan of grafitti. But Banksy is a true artist, unlike the vast majority of those who deface public property. In short this book makes a good coffee table book that guests will be intrigued by - for at least the next 5 minutes anyway.
020530902X|5.0|This is one of the greatest guides I've ever laid eyes on.  If you write anything, grocery lists, post it note memos, parking tickets... you need this book.  It's short, straight to the point, and effective.  Read this.
0634022296|5.0|This is absolutely the closest I've ever seen any music book come as far as its accuracy.  Chords I've never been able to figure out on my own are easily provided in this song book and appear to be totally accurate.  My only complaint is the binding...too hard to keep the book open.  I had mine cut and made into a spiral which works beautifully.  Definitely worth the money!
1843104954|5.0|I felt like I was reading my loved one's biography.  This book was very helpful to my understanding of Asperger's Syndrome.
0099765217|5.0|there are those who have read it and there are those who aren't worth talking to.
B000QFCD5O|5.0|WOW! If you remeber the early 80's power prog and pop hit makers you'll love this collection. All the Wetton era hits summed up on two CD's. One of the things that caught my ear when I saw ASIA live and on this cd was Carl Palmer's fantastic playing. As a matter of fact the whole band is spot on. If we can only get them to do a DRAMA era yes song.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I must say - listen to the album a few times, it definately grows on you.  It is totally different, so you need to give yourself time to seperate what you \\"THINK\\" you should hear from Kelly Clarkson.  She is a truly talented musician!!!    Enjoy
B000EF5NAS|5.0|Towanda!!!  How wonderful to be able to see this amazing movie again!  The two stories of Idgy and Ruth as young women and Evelyn and Ninny as older and older yet women tied together so lovingly and well by Fanny Flagg in her book.  I am so glad I bought this movie for my collection.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Awesome movie, now in HD... You've seen reviews for the movie everywhere, so I wont bore you with that.. but OMG, the sharpness, the clarity, leaves one speechless...  I cant rate this high enough.
0061186422|1.0|I was very disappointed when I bought this book. I thought it would be a new collection of short stories by Gaiman, but it turns out it's just a compilation of select stories from FRAGILE THINGS and SMOKE AND MIRRORS.<br /><br />Waste of money.
B0009X766Y|5.0|I think that Oceans Eleven was trying to copy this movie; the big bad rich guy who they want to ruin, they steal his money..........ETC. Although I did like Oceans Eleven and stuff about it was unique, I though that this was by far so much better. Also I really like Robert Redford movies! Try watching Buch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(also starring Paul Newman) or All the Presidents Men.
B000I0QLZU|3.0|The Blu-ray is disappointed. The sound is 1.5 Mbps instead of 4.6 Mbps because of the bonus in it. The picture isn't so perfect as I expected because there's less color than other movies in Blu-ray and the definition is no so good. However, le main menu is great and the trailers in HD !!
B000OVLBEY|5.0|This is a very good movie, i liked it alot, there is a ton of action and stunts that are amazing.
B000FGGE7C|5.0|EXCELLENT BLU-RAY !!!! I've nerver seen such a perfect Blu-ray : there's no black strip so you can see fully the HD !! The definition is perfect and astonishing !! The sound is 4.6 Mbps !! Everything is pecfect !! I recomand it !!
6303407161|5.0|Its 1957 and the very popular show \\"Twenty-One\\" attracts the national eyeballs. A patent medicine is the sponsor. Just answer a few questions and you can win a big prize. It seems so easy! Then we see the whims of the top managers affect the show. Herb Stempel is a hero to his neighborhood. The college instructor Charles Van Doren applies to be a contestant. The producers think he has star quality and want him on \\"Twenty-One\\". They also explain how things work. A new face will perk up interest. The big event comes, and Herb Stempel takes a very dramatic dive. That's show business, folks. Charles Van Doren puts on his act to be the new winner.    The contestant is led through a series of questions. They know what he knows, and what he doesn't, so its easy to promote or demote any contestant. Stempel goes to the NY Grand Jury, NBC soon learns of his secret testimony. Stempel made a poor investment with his winnings and wants more. Lawyer Goodwin noticed the attempt to squelch the Grand Jury presentment. Judge Mitchell Schweitzer upholds this cover-up (wasn't he later involved with some scandal?). Goodwin tracks down contestants (like Woodward and Bernstein). Van Doren basked in his fame. Goodwin asked his opinion about the show. Finally Goodwin talked to Stempel and got his story. [The monetary figures from 50 years ago must be multiplied by 20 for today's values.]    Stempel took a dive because of what he was promised. (He should have known better.) They had the foresight to send him to a therapist so they could question his mental stability! But Goodwin checked the facts. Stempel admitted he got the answers, and Goodwin's investigation continued. When viewing a film of the show he noticed an anomaly in Jack Berry's performance! Then he sees Van Doren take a dive, and lose after 14 weeks. But there is a consolation prize of a $50,000 salary as a cultural advisor. Goodwin confronted Enright with a registered letter, proof of rigging the show.    Goodwin's detective work lead to a Congressional hearing into television. Stempel was a star witness. Can a television network stand to be distrusted? Would print and radio profit from this? The manufacturer of Geritol told how his sales went up 50% when Van Doren was on. Of course they suspected nothing, and admitted to nothing. Could an old college professor really be so naive as to be shocked by paid performances on television? Charles Van Doren showed up to admit to the facts: he was involved in a deception. How unlike his peers in corporations or government! Putting on an act is so common in television, then or now, that no one should be shocked. Just look at the Congressional speeches at the hearings, then or now.    Enright took the blame for everything to spare the corporations. Freedman admitted to rigging the quiz shows: its entertainment. NBC is owned by RCA, Rockefeller companies (they knew nothing). This is the story of a deception by one intellectual who served corporations. How many tens of thousands of intellectuals have deceived the public for corporations without being exposed? This lavish production may not have recovered its costs at the box office. Goodwin later became a speech writer for JFK and wrote a book on this story. John Turturro seems to be \\"the man with a 1,000 faces\\" for his many acting roles in films.
B000IOM0WE|5.0|This Blu-ray is perfect as I expected. The bonus aren't, of course, in HD. The movie has a sound of 1.5 Mbps instead of 4.6 Mbps because of the bonus in the Blu-ray.However, it's what we expect of a Blu-ray !!
0316067598|4.0|In today's war against radical Islam, it is comforting to know the capabilities of our elite warriors. It is also good to know that they are plenty of good Muslim people who reject the violence and lunacy  so often associated with their religion.  Luttrell does a great job of explaining the situation on the ground in Afghanistan. Many people often feel that we should have \\"finished the job\\" in Afghanistan, but these same people have no idea of the physical size of that country as well as all of its tribal factions and customs. Most of Afghanistan is still in the Stone Age.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I am not very impressed with this movie.  I expected it to take my breath away and that just simply did not happen.  I much, much prefer Pride and Prejudice and also Sense and Sensibility over Persuasion.  Maybe I need to watch it again.  Sometimes after another viewing it becomes better.
8489367116|5.0|I have worked in the slums of New Delhi and so many of the author's descriptions could only have been written by someone who had spent a significant amount of time in the slums of India.  His comments and his style of writing are impressive and I highly recommend this book to anyone!  Be forewarned, once you start you may not be able to put this down!
B000OLGCHA|5.0|For those just giving the soundtrack a bad reviw because they want John Williams back is unfair. This soundtrack is full of life and beautifully draws the picture of the story of harry potter. The use of hedwig's theme is wonderful and umbridge's theme is intoxicating and pleasing to the ears. I thought the GOF soundtrack was a joke and felt this soundtrack to be a breath of fresh air.
B000FJGWBM|4.0|Any know why this movie only shows in letterbox format on my ps3???  thanks.
B000055Y0Y|4.0|In the Line of Fire should probably be on my Amazon Listmania List of \\"16 Flicks Guaranteed To Leave A Permanent Impression\\" (click on my name above and check out my profile if you'd like to see the List). Who can forget the Oscar and Globe nominated performance of John Malkovich as the diabolical assassin with the deadpan delivery and that home-made gun?<br /><br />And Clint Eastwood, as always, is as fresh as ever...even though this is one of his corner-turning films of the 90s where he started taking on the persona of an \\"aging\\" character as opposed to the \\"middle-aged\\" tough guy roles of his 80s run.<br /><br />Rene Russo (who seems to have disappeared from the screen as of this writing) was looking very 2007 Fergie/Drew Barrymore. And there are a ton of other popular character actors that populate the cast of In the Line of Fire that helped make this one of the best movies of 1993.<br /><br />Wolfgang Peterson -- who has other winners in his stable like Das Boot [[ASIN:0767802470 Das Boot - The Director's Cut]] , Outbreak [[ASIN:0790731401 Outbreak]] and The Perfect Storm [[ASIN:B000P0J0C4 The Perfect Storm]] -- directs In the Line of Fire and keeps the action coming and the witty dialogue flowing. There are a few on-foot chase scenes that were very thrilling, but lacked in the that-could-really-happen department.<br /><br />If you've never seen In the Line of Fire and you like a good Thriller, this will give you 2 hours of thorough entertainment. If the last time you saw it was back towards its 1993 release, you'll enjoy another look as it holds up very nicely almost 15 years later.
0471603864|5.0|Seriously, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, BUY THIS BOOK NOW.    I find it hard to describe to you in words how much I love this book.  I am just speechless!  This book will take you by the hand and spoon feed you all the important concepts and calculation steps.  If you are thinking of pursuing a high energy physics and trying to find the very first book to read on this subject, Griffiths is THE ONE.      Reading QFT books before this book is in my opinion a NO-GO.  Trust me from someone that has been there!  You lose insight immediately and get taken down hard by the unfamiliar math.  Griffiths knows how to explain things and always keeps in close contact with the actual physics.  You will never lose motivation / insights into what's going on.    Take my word for it.  BUY THIS BOOK NOW!  You will save hundreds of hours invested on other books that claim to be \\"good\\".  There are none of this kind.    After Griffiths, proceed to Ryder's QFT, and then Peskins.  Then and only then will you finally see the light of the day.  There are not other routes to the promised land.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Cinematography is fantastic. The only negative is David Attenborough's narration is so quiet in points that the orchestral music drowns him out.  I preferred Sigourney Weaver's narration on the television broadcast.
B00005R2M3|4.0|When I first heard this album, it took me a while to adjust to Shakira's distinctive bent, edgy intonation and raw yowling, along with pure, unbridled passion.  The year was 2001.  Shakira Mebarek had already spent years as a well-known singer/songwriter in Mexico, Central and South America.  It was time that the Yanquis get acquainted with her [i.e. music lovers in the United States].  So, Shakira penned her English-language debut, LAUNDRY SERVICE [later released as SERVICIO DE LAVANDERIA, to her Spanish-speaking audience].  Her combination of Latin, rock and Arabic rhythms proved just as infectious in English (one of the three languages she speaks fluently) as in Spanish.<br /><br />Some of the best songs on this album include \\"Objection [Tango],\\" with a Spanish version \\"Te Aviso, Te Anuncio,\\" and \\"Whenever, Wherever,\\" with it's spanish counterpart, \\"Suerte.\\"  What's more, Shakira showed her range as a soulful pop singer in slower ballads like \\"Underneath Your Clothes,\\" and \\"The One.\\"  What's more, who can forget her sultry, sexy \\"Que Me Quedes Tu\\"?  This intelligent and accomplished singer [then twenty-four years old] showed us her singing chops and her true ability to connect audiences of all backgrounds and lanaguages together with her tunes.  Though, I must say that, if pressed, her best album by far is DONDE ESTAN LOS LADRONES?  [her 1998 release], LAUNDRY SERVICE is a very appealing CD to own.  I definitely reccomend it, six years later.
081541028X|5.0|This is a great first hand peek behind the people with 'The Right Stuff.'  The book is very balanced, chatty (& sometimes catty), instructive, technical and humorous.  Collins is a natural storyteller with an eye for the absurd and the ridiculous.  It will please space buffs and non-space buffs alike.  Collins puts a real human slant on the epic of the race to the moon which is infinitely more fascinating than the cardboard one-dimensional heroes we were presented with by the media in the sixties.
B00003CXFV|4.0|This movie had a real STORY to tell and what one person can really do, if they're committed to doing something about a company who thinks it's above anyone and anything else!  I enjoyed it because I thought it was very well done and was also a TRUE story.      Very course language (probably for authenticity) and not for anyone under 17 or 18, I would suggest.  Anyone younger probably wouldn't get anything out of it anyway.  Its geared for adults anyway due to the subject matter (chemicals seeping into private wells, etc.).
B000IZJZLM|5.0|If you like great singing buy this album.  These  guys are the greatest thing to hit the music scene in decades!
B000BT97AO|2.0|The disk hub had been torn off and the dvd was full of marks. I didnt se any signs of the marks when I wached the movie, but i was kind of pist when I got the package. I dont like paying for damaged stuff.
B000059ZIC|5.0|Among the annals of the greatest historical registers ever made this set must be included in a top list of the twenty five gem performances of the chamber music genre.<br /><br />There is not any violinist of today capable to equal the level of expression and total commitment of Joseph Suk. Moreover, can boast of this kaleidoscopic variety of tonal colour, organic phrasing, mercurial tact, and even major ability to express with such deepness of sheer lyricism.<br /><br />Of course, there must be a strong acknowledgement in which concerns to the musical support of Julius Katchen one of the most extraordinary pianist born in USA, whose musical canvas sounds so expressive natural that it would seem to have been born in Europe. His velvet sound, his accuracy around every single bar and his inimitable pianissimos makes of him the most remarkable American pianist playing Brahms. He captured and knew to deal with the essential core of Brahms, conferring him of grace, charm ,deepness without that nestled humor into the musical structure.<br /><br />I would like to underline this last aspect because without that Mediterranean touch, Brahms may be unbearable to listen. That's why there are so many brilliant pianists who conscious or unconsciously increase a pretended austerity in his music, lacking that kind spirit of a man who loved the Hungarian tunes and  maintained a sort of formidable equilibrium between expression and charm; vigor and lyricism.<br /><br />That's why this set must be acquired in case you (as I do) be a hard fan Brahms chamber music and effectively want to possess the4 best versions of this first rate composer.<br /><br />A must-have.
0316067598|4.0|It is not very often that I read a non-fiction book.  It is even more rare that I read a non-fiction book that I have a hard time putting down.  This was the case with this book.  Even though I knew the what the final outcome of the book was going to be, it was still suspenseful to read about the events leading up to the end. There are parts that will bring tears to your eyes not only with sadness but also happiness. This is a book that makes you proud of the men and women who serve our country.    What I liked most about the book was that it not only told about Operation Redwing and all the events surrounding it, but it also told all about the training (Indoc and BUD/S) that these young men have to go through to become a SEAL.  I found this very interesting. I also enjoyed learning a little about the Afgan culture of these mountain tribes.    What I did not like about the book was the vast amount of useless profanity. I did not mind it if it was part of a quote someone said in the recollection of a conversation, but outside of that I thought the extreme amount of profanity made the book seem less professional and quite frankly, amateurish. I also agree with some of the other reviewers that there may have been a little too much arrogance and rah rah. I dismiss most of this because he is young and very proud, but I would have had more appreciation if the book had come across as more humble. But the bottom line is that Marcus Luttrell and every other man and woman who wear the uniform of the United States are real heroes and this is the story about a group of them that is worth reading.     I read this book because one of my former students, who attended the Naval Academy and went on to become a SEAL, reccommeded it to me. It is an exciting story definitely worth reading, but my advice would be to wait for the paperback edition or buy it used.  It is not that incredible of a book that you should rush out and pay full price for like I did.
B0000D8HDF|5.0|Cyprien Katsaris is an astonishing pianist. His countless contributions respect minor works of well known composers such Brahms for instance, made of him to defy that epic challenge that means to play these Nine Symphonies transcribed by Franz Liszt for the keyboard.<br /><br />You may realize that, with the only exception of Leslie Howard, there has not been any other pianist who has decided to face with the countless difficulties demanded for the score.<br /><br />But Katsaris confers &eacute;clat, elegance and expressiveness, without losing that Beethovenian drive force,that makes - at least to my mind - an insurmountable and excel effort worthy to admire and acknowledge.<br /><br />Don't miss these extraordinary recordings of this notable pianist.
B0000A0DRY|1.0|Buyer beware.  Most CD companies today use digital hyper compression to make their remastered recordings sound as loud as possible.  This results in very harsh sounding music.  There are few music companies that still produce good sounding oldies rock.    The CD companies are completely clueless of the need to preserve the original hi-fi sound of the original LP recordings and have now affectively destroyed the rock oldies portion of the music business.     Anyone wanting original full range sound today is advised to purchase a CD recorder (such as Denon etc) and convert their LPs to CD.

B000N3ST8O|5.0|As with anything Stevie Nicks - I eagerly awaited the arrival of \\"Crystal Visions\\", and it doesnt disappoint.    Although some of the songs have been covered before in the Enchanted [[ASIN:B0000062S2 Enchanted: The Works of Stevie Nicks]]collection, the extra features included in this set are well worth the purchas - Including audio from her Melbourne concert in January 2006.     As for the DVD - there is clips and concert footage that I hadnt seen before that I am now very happy to have in my collection.
0783225857|5.0|Having read \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" and seeing the movie in high school I was glad to be able to purchase the movie.  This movie definitely shows the talent of some of the best actors of all times.  It is definitely something for the family to enjoy no matter what time of day or year it is.
B000GUJYLA|5.0|I've been a high school band director for over 22 years.  It doesn't matter whether your group is a show band, corp style, big ten, etc., the concepts of teamwork and discipline involved in a band is shown in this movie.  So many things ring true, especially the \\"one band, one sound\\" section.  If you're in a marching band or ever have been, you'll enjoy this!  The Morehouse director also reminds me of my good friend and colleague, Dr. Benjamin Ivory Kirk (now deceased), former assistant director at Tennessee State University.  I think of him every time I watch it!
B000QCUB8I|2.0|I can't even begin to see how they equate Justice with Daft Punk!!  This isn't techno and it's certainly not rock or punk.  It's noise, alright?  It's Chemical Brothers if the Chemical Brothers had no rhythm... or an insanely short attention span.  When I listen to Techno or Dance music, I need some kind of element to tie it all together... to facilitate the musical journey, if you will... a beat.  Justice keeps throwing in different shrill sounds and...  Hell, they make Ministry and the whole Industrial movement sound almost classical.  Sorry guys, but I don't get it.  Justice sounds to me like bad noise.  The only decent track there contains a sample from an Italian dance song.<br /><br />J'suis desole les mecs, but when you compare Justice to others often lumped into contemporary \\"French sound\\":  Air, Daft Punk, Kid Loco, and many others... these guys leave lots to be desired.
B0000DGDOJ|4.0|The Eurodisco emanating from Germany provided a special flavour to the music of the 1970s. This charming collection contains the big hits Save Me, Fly Robin Fly which was a Billboard Number One, Get Up And Boogie plus some minor ones like San Francisco Hustle, all foot-tapping tunes with great female vocals and catchy hooks. Other examples of the genre include Munich Machine and [[ASIN:B000002UP0 The Andrea True Connection]]. Of course disco legends Donna Summer and Boney M also had their roots in Munich. All the tracks are enjoyable to listen to, especially if you're into nostalgia. This is a comprehensive compilation of the Munich-based band and transports you back to the golden age of dance. No disco collection is complete without it.
B000I5Y9G8|5.0|It has been said this is Hammill's most personal release. I am not sure about that.  But I feel it is his most painful.  Breakups can be acutely painful and that formed the setting, the catalyst for this gem. Peter Gabriel would do his own broken relationships album with \\"Us\\" many years later.  That too is a gem but not the subject at hand.    When I went through my second divorce this CD became my friend.  I knew there was someone out there who had felt like I did , who had anguished like I was doing. Someone who had been both very sad and very angry.  Someone who knew.  Someone who knew intimately the pain of a breakup.  Peter Hammill.  Got to love him.  I do.     This is an essential release for the Hammill fan.  I am not going to review each song.  That I am sure is covered elsewhere. Get the CD and discover it for yourself.  But I would be amiss if I did not mention a few titles.  Like the achingly sad but beautiful \\"Looking Glass\\" or the following track \\"Betrayed\\".  Betrayed is one of the most if not the most vitriolic angst filled Hammill songs ever.  Last mentioned here is \\"On Tuesdays...\\" which to me is almost unbearable to listen to. It has on more than once occasion reduced me to tears. Incredible stuff.     Powerful music.  Inspired music. Music born of raw emotions.  In the vast catalogue of Hammill releases this must be considered a must have, no questions asked.
B0009A21R6|5.0|I have been listening to the CD version for a while now and the SACD version is just leaps and bounds ahead ! Dont miss this even if you have the CD. The sound envelops you and I could hear new nuances that I missed on the CD.
B00004BZ0N|2.0|Just about the Clash's worst album; (I think the lumpen 'Sandinista' is better because it's got the fabulous 'Somebody Got Murdered' on it.) 'London Calling' is as bland and dreary as it's title suggests.<br />I thought London was burning with boredom (Dial 99999!), but now it seems it's just...calling. Oh well.<br /><br />It starts brilliantly with the title track but then it's downhill fast, Lack-luster forays into r+b and reggae, rockabilly and jazz; drifting and meandering all over the place in a vain attempt to find some badly needed cohesion - some sort of direction in among the painfully forced 'diversity'.<br /><br />It's a well known rock truism that Strummer and Jones weren't getting on at the time this was recorded, and you can tell - it sounds like they were in different rooms!<br />It's sad to watch this once-great song-writing team align against each other in such an obvious (and childish!) way. Strummer with his slurry 'rocka' pose, and Jones with his toe-curling 'Americanisms'.<br /><br />Strummer didn't recover 'til 'Combat Rock' and before you start scoffing, compare 'Straight to Hell' with ANYTHING on here and it'll be the stronger song by streets.<br /><br />Anything containing the inexplicably awful 'Guns of Brixton' just HAS to suck a big one (now THERE'S a song worth a giggle or two), and along with 'This Is Radio Clash', their poorest song in a frustratingly inconsistent canon (if ever a group's output was justifiably labeled 'peaks and troughs' it's the Clash).<br /><br />If only 'London Calling' the album was as good as 'London Calling' the song, we'd have something special on our hands; as it is, we've got something tired, a bit derivative, and really rather tatty.<br /><br />'London Calling' was voted the best album of all time in a poll;<br />It's not even the best Clash album.
B000002C25|5.0|i recommend that people listen to this album. i am not a music critic so i don't understand the poor reviews. to me its oasis...rock'n'roll, arrogance, and tunes that blow you away. give it a shot, you won't regret it.<br /><br />lastly, listen to 'do know what i mean' and you can almost feel what it's like to be a rock star. :-P
B0000CEB62|5.0|My best friend introduced me to DM in the late 80s early 90s.  I have been addicted ever since and didn't even realize after listening to some songs that I was an unknowing fan.      She had a copy of 101 and after the first viewing we watched it repeatedly.  Weekends were spent enjoying the music and wishing we were the fans having one heck of a road trip.      I eventually got to go to one of their concerts and I have to say that this DVD touched base on what it was like to be there.  It was amazing the electricity and excitement DM could put into a show run with 3 Keyboards and some sound machines but it will always be one of the greatest concert experiences of my life.      If you like Great music, entertainment, and a look at your favorite band then this is one of the best DVDs you can add to your collection.  LOVE the band and music!
B0009A40ES|5.0|I got this movie because I am a huge Christian Bale fan.  I didn't expect it to be so good.  If you're into heartless psychotic killer movies with blood, guts, and a sense of humor, you will enjoy this.  The 80's references make this kind of fun to watch too.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|Following the sparkling, evocative efforts of Williams and Doyle, this is a generic, dull offering, and certainly brings no magic to the film. It lacks depth and emotional resonance, and actually would work better as background music for a TV movie. Sounds like the composer had little or no visceral connection to the film or to the story and its characters.  It's sad to think they've given Hooper the next film to score as well; if neither of the previous composers is available, call in Howard Shore or even James Newton Howard before it's too late. Blah; save your money on this one.

The characters are so well-developed it makes me think these people are real. I want to meet them. It's shocking in the fact that it is so raw. Anyone that reads this can relate. You must read this book.

0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris would admit he's had trouble getting his message across.<br /><br />As a youth at his dad's insistence, he tried communicating through music, from a guitar teacher more interested in bedroom swingin' than guitar slingin'. As he got older, he attempted it through performance art, only to push museum audiences' patience in his performances (and his life to its edge through substance abuse) before his family humorously intervened. He's avoided pronouncing s's so not to lisp as a youth, and ordered groceries in French plurals not to be misunderstood as an adult.<br /><br />Be thankful he chose the written word, even chipped away from his manual typewriter. To be sure, his masterful \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" addresses Sedaris' failures to communicate with family: foul-mouthed little brother Paul, dangerous, stunningly beautiful sister (actress/writer Amy Sedaris), their redneck-resisting, jazz-loving dad Lou, and boyfriend Hugh (who share a home and their own communication breakdowns living in France as Americans.) But in honest moments, Sedaris lets us laugh often at his and our fear of ostracism.<br /><br />He revisits this point consistently through his stories, each easily read independently and none more than 10 pages. He casually mocks his family's resistance to assimilate into North Carolina culture, a family friend's spending (almost) every minute in New York City afraid of would be shysters, and an American couple's fearing Sedaris as a French pickpocket while the husband shows his wife \\"my Paris.\\" The need to fit even permeates the book's wilder stories: Sedaris' daydreams in his next-to-last chapter, his borrowed tall tales from Hugh's childhood and from walking a French county fair, even the literally side-splitting \\"Big Boy\\" (which broke my children up when yours truly read it aloud on a recent cross-state road trip.)<br /><br />But \\"Me Talk Pretty\\" is most enjoyable when Sedaris' shows his love and respect for the family and friends he gently skewers. His sister wears a fat suit to enrage her weight-concious father, who eats spoiled food rather than waste it. Sedaris shares the funny, heartbreaking story of how family dogs helped his parents worked through their kids' leaving home, his mother's passing, and even the death of their beloved Great Dane, Melina. For all Sedaris' stories at their expense, you realize by book's end his home (with family and with his boyfriend) was the only place his and his family's witty iconoclasm could rest its pen and sword.<br /><br />Book promotion compared Sedaris' style with Dorothy Parker and James Thurber, but he lacks Parker's bitter venom (if also her stiletto-sharp wordplay). But \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" borrows as easily from Erma Bombeck's sense of family detail and your favorite travelogues to effectively show how good it feels to belong and the joy of expressing it. Highly recommended.suit to enrage her weight-concious father, who eats spoiled food rather than waste it.

B000M0XJ88|5.0|I bought one of these a couple years ago in Singapore.  I love it.  It is my staple everyday watch.  They are tough and withstand  a fair bit of abuse.  I wore mine while training and flying aerobatics up to 6Gs.  Still works.  The movement does tend to be fast, some say by 5 to 15 sec per day.  My experience is that I notice it is running fast by a few minutes every little while and then I correct it.  Not an issue especially since it is an automatic watch.  If I go more than a day without wearing or shaking it, it stops anyway, so who needs longterm accuracy?    I love it.  I'm buying a second one in dark green.  ...May start a collection.
B000PY52EU|1.0|An incredibly stupid and unnecessary, as well as surprisingly dull, exploitation flick about a troubled white gal and the black blues guitarist who tries to save her from herself.  Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci wasted themselves in this.  Were they hard up for money or what?    Only worth watching for Justin Timberlake.
1400063515|4.0|Most predictions are flat out wrong, just listen to any \\"expert\\" on CNBC give a prediction of where the market is headed on a given day.  Yet, we love predictions because they help us feel like we understand what's going on around us much better than we actually do...the idea of randomness is uncomfortable.  The reason our prophecies fall so short is our lack of understanding of the Black Swan and its impact on both history and the future.  The Black Swan as Taleb describes it is:<br />1) an outlier 2) carries extreme impact 3) produces explanations only after the fact.<br /><br />The bulk of Taleb's book explains in great detail, clarity, and wit the error most humans make in failing to account for the Black Swan in their thinking.  He explores various theories ranging from our eagerness to interpret the \\"causes\\" in history (confirmation bias, narrative fallacy, etc.) to our inabilities to predict the future (the expert problem, herding and the character of prediction errors).<br /><br />Finally, Taleb doesn't stop with mere theory; he gives the reader help in how to think in a Black Swan world.  His advice, make black swans gray by being aggressive in gaining exposure to positive Black Swans and extremely conservative when under the threat of a negative Black Swan.  You're probably reading this right now going, I think I know what he is talking about, but you don't, just read the book and be prepared to have your comfort zone shattered and your mind exercised.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Renee Zellweger and Ewan MacGregor do a credible job of portraying the children's author and her lover in this lovely period piece. Very nice use of animated watercolors showing the writer's imagination at work.  Suitable for just about anyone except the very young, who would be bored with the romance and the old-fashioned look and feel of the film.
B000063DHL|4.0|By the time \\"Somewhere in Time\\" came out in 1986, I was well into Iron Maiden. I owned every album available in the States, had read \\"Running Free,\\" and took in my very first concert -- 1985's World Slavery Tour. (What a first concert!) Fairly or unfairly, I had high expectations for this next album, feeling that my musical heroes could do no wrong.<br /><br />I had read that the group would be incorporating a guitar-synth on the next album. I also had heard that Bruce Dickinson wanted to take a different direction and do an acoustic album. What really got me interested was that Adrian Smith was going to take a lead role in some of the songwriting. With having a hand writing songs such as \\"The Prisoner,\\" \\"The Flight of Icarus,\\" \\"22 Arcacia Avenue,\\" and \\"2 Minutes to Midnight,\\" I couldn't wait!<br /><br />I managed to pick up the cassette on the release date, and was again impressed by yet another Derek Riggs masterpiece. I know I missed out on the album art detail with the cassette, but records were well on their way out at this time, and I wanted to listen to this album on the way home. Those that have the album can see all the little jokes on neon signs and in the storefront windows.<br /><br />My first impression? I was under-whelmed. The opener \\"Caught Somewhere in Time\\" fell somewhat flat -- I just couldn't get into the guitar synths. At that time, some of the other songs seemed like throwaways -- \\"Heaven Can Wait,\\" \\"Deja Vu,\\" \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner,\\" and \\"Alexander the Great\\" really didn't do much for me. To me, Adrian Smith's songs were by far the strongest on the album. \\"Wasted Years\\" and especially \\"Sea of Madness\\" and \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" really showcase some fine songwriting skills.<br /><br />I think the album as a whole was a letdown to me because it seemed somewhat uninspired and lacked direction. It wasn't until years later that I learned there were some creative differences within the band at that time that might have affected the material. I also looked at \\"Alexander the Great\\" as an attempt to recapture the lyrical magic of Powerslave's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" Musically, it's interesting, but lyrically, it fell flat. Coleridge's epic poem translated much better to music than Plutrarch's history.<br /><br />But time has a way of putting things in perspective; and looking back at this album, knowing what was going on within the band at this time, and hearing the music again after all those years, I find I enjoy listening to the whole thing. I still think Adrian's songs are the strongest, but I have a new appreciation for those songs I kicked to the curb back in '86. I will even go as far as saying musically they've rarely been in better form on an album.<br /><br />1986/87's Somewhere on Tour concert was spectacular -- probably better than the World Slavery Tour by a hair. Flying spaceships, Bruce's pulsing neon-tube vest, and a robot Eddie...what's there not to like? I found the SIT songs translated very well live -- even with the synth guitars. I remember Adrian and Dave performing a really cool guitar-duet they called \\"Walking on Glass.\\" A top notch show.<br /><br />For me, this one ranks three and a quarter stars.

B000696PWC|5.0|This 2-disc collection is quite possibly the best compilation of pop music ever put together.  It's my favorite pop CD, especially the first disc.  I don't know why Kylie didn't make it bigger over here back in the day; she is a Pop Princess if ever there was one.  The first disc is my favorite of the two; it consists of the 80s stuff and has some of the catchiest beats of anything I've heard.  I especially love:  I Should Be So Lucky, What Do I Have to Do, Wouldn't Change a Thing, Hand on Your Heart, Got to Be Certain, and Je Ne Sais Quo.  But don't count disc 2 out, no way.  It has the more recent stuff Kylie's done as her \\"comeback\\" second phase, and it definitely grows on the listener.  It is Kylie being more independent, including having a hand in a lot of the writing, and shows she is truly an artist in her own right.  I really like Giving You Up on the second disc.  This collection shows Kylie has definitely had staying power.  Great work, Kylie.  Fans of female pop singers must have this collection.

B000J10ERO|5.0|Superman has always been fun to watch but now he is even more fun. I think Bryan Singer did a great job with the movie and the cast. Brandon Routh was the perfect choice for Superman because he looks so much like Christopher Reeve and acts like he did. I think Kevin Spacey was a great Lex Luthor because this Lex was more darker than Gene Hackman's but still funny like Gene's. Superman Returns is a good movie with the right cast and director. If you own the old Superman films you will love to add this one to your collection.
B000J10EQU|3.0|...I'm still waiting for Superman. Bryan Singer brings his gee-wizardry to the mothballed Superman series and then utterly fails to add anything new. In fact, he barely can disguise the fact that he has - in essence - remade the first Christopher Reeves' \\"[[ASIN:B000059Z8J Superman]]\\" with a time-line update or two. Brandon Routh (who seemed to get the part because of his uncanny resemblance to Reeves) returns to Earth after a futile five year search for the remnants of Krypton. He discovers that Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth, looking far too young for the part) has moved on, got a fiance and had a son. She even kissed Superman off with a Pulitzer Prize editorial called \\"Why The World Doesn't Need Superman.\\"<br /><br />And then there's Lex Luthor. Using the five years that Superman has vanished to bilk an aging billionairess of all her money, he is back to plotting Lutherland again. I was all but waiting for the terrific Parker Posey to blubber \\"But Lex, my mother lives in Hackensack\\" as Luther (a malevolent and humorless Kevin Spacey) describes how millions, no, BILLIONS will die as he floods the continent.<br /><br />It's all pretty obvious where this is headed, no? If you're old enough to remember seeing the first Christopher Reeves version, then little of this will surprise you. Everyone plays their parts well (with the exception of Bosworth as Lane) and some of the minor casting is excellent (Frank Langella and Eva Marie Saint in particular). The crashing jet is a great opening for the film and does get \\"Superman Returns\\" off to a flying start, but there is just too much retread here to raise this above average. Here's hoping Singer, who has proven himself to be a far better movie-maker than this, gets a crack at the sequel. Should he manage that, I am hoping he can move past the cliches and deliver a Superman that is as original and as vibrant as the 70's movies he so obviously admires.<br /><br />Another nice touch - the dedication to Christopher and Dana Reeves.<br /><br />Incidentally, this DVD has NO extras. Not even a trailer or previews. Nada, nutting. For a full price DVD, that's a bit of a gyp,D has NO extras. Not even a trailer or previews. Nada, nutting. For a full price DVD, that's a bit of a gyp,
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I thought it was a funny,enjoyable little film. The actors gave great performences and I think this is Will Ferrell's best movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet I suggest you buy it because you will want to watch it over and over again.
1582701709|5.0|I just finished listening to the audio version of this book and I was greatly moved.  But I was shocked when I read all the negative reviews on Amazon.  I strongly disagree to those who say this book is \\"dangerous,\\" in fact, I think this book should be required reading for all (especially for those who have been told for decades that they couldn't do certain things because of their race/sex/religion/physical appearance/etc).     What harm is there in believing that you (or your thoughts) are what controls your destiny????  What's wrong with imagining something that you want and pretending you already have it?  If you listen closely, you will notice that those who have had material gains (The Chicken Soup for the Soul author as an example) didn't just sit back and watch it happen, because they were more in tune with their goals, they were more cognizant of opportunities that arose.  There was plenty of hard work involved!!!    The part I liked the best and I think could help human kind in general the most is the suggestion to always keep yourself in a good and loving mood.  Could you imagine if everyone did that?!?!  There would only be peace in the world and no one would complain about lousy customer service again (just humm the theme song from Disney's \\"It's a Small World\\" while you think about this).  But seriously, why are we all so hardwired to believe that being happy all the time is impossible or wrong?  Isn't being happy ultimately just a choice anyway?     For all the naysayers out there, I'm really interested and I would love to hear someone's story where negative thinking (or the self defeating attitude that someone else controlled your destiny) helped someone become happy and successful.
B000M341QE|5.0|The Departed was so great and exciting. All the actors were great and the story was perfect. This is Leonardo de Caprio's best film to date. There are so many twists and turns in this film and the ending is very suprising. If you haven't seen this movie already I suggest you get it as soon as possible because it's great and enjoyable.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|I often wonder why record labels are constantly using market differentiation strategies depending on where and how the product is sold. Believe it or not, the Brazilian version for the download of \\"Era Vulgaris\\" contains three more songs than the CD and two more than the iTunes versions. These songs are named \\"Running Joke\\" (available on iTunes), \\"Era Vulgaris\\" (also available on the British CD) and \\"The Fun Machine Took a S**t and Died\\" (also available on the French CD). It's a common practice that, while makes some people happier to own just a few more songs than the others, makes these others to feel like fools.  People who choose to buy the CD do so because they like the physical product, to carry and play it everywhere without any DRM restriction, just the old way. I am sorry to say that not everyone gets the same product for the same amount of money. That's a shame. It is interesting to note that the full 14-track version runs for about 62 minutes, which fits perfectly onto an audio CD. So absolutely no excuses that anybody could give us for such differences are reasonable.<br /><br />Now let's focus on the \\"common\\" and \\"less privileged\\" version, which is the CD. Less privileged for sure, but cool enough to provide us some moments of delight. It's hard rock, but not that hard (I mean annoying here) in the general sense. My personal picks are \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\", \\"Into the Hollow\\" and \\"3's & 7's\\". In some songs, while hearing Josh Homme on vocals, it often reminds me of Chris Cornell's voice (specially on \\"Battery Acid\\" and \\"3's & 7's\\"). I think they both own a very similar singing style.<br /><br />\\"Make it Wit Chu\\" is a serious mistake. Sucks a lot! If for some reason they didn't want to gather all of the 14 songs in the CD version, \\"Era Vulgaris\\" or \\"The Fun Machine...\\" would have been better choices to put in place of this one. For this reason, and only for this reason, I give this record a 4-star rating.
B0001ZMWQO|3.0|Okay, so in spite the title, the record isn't really bad. However, in spite the glowing reviews of praise, it isn't anything extraordinary or even ground-breaking for that matter. There are too many bands to name of the past 25+ years who played \\"post-punk\\" that played in a similar vein to this group. Yet for some reason people go ga-ga on this. I suppose it's another case of the guys being British, and critics just love those kinds of bands. The comparisons to the Strokes made a lot of sense when it was out, as they merely worked better for the release time than actually had a whole lot of verve going on.    There is a certain style to the tracks, I have to admit. It's fairly catchy and not that hard to get into. I particularly am a fan of the lead single \\"Take Me Out,\\" with its minute-long intro having a classic melody and then it goes into its dance-rock mode for the rest of the song. While I'm kind of glad the hi-hat has been brought back into music during the type of \\"in\\" indie music of the past few years, I've heard other bands pull this off in a much more interesting manner. The tracks are fine enough, but can also be a bit redundant and can get old after awhile. There are other moments that I like and it's entertaining so I guess it can work for you. And some of those moments include things like the opening chords of \\"40\\" and the record was nicely enough produced.    I suppose it will work for you but while entertaining, it's not that special at all. It seems that in its context people don't even remember the record quite as well as when it was first released.

1400063515|3.0|The ideas behind Black Swan are intriguing and interesting. What person would not like to learn how to spot the unpredictable, consequential, and clearly seen once it happens?  The funny thing is that Nasim Taleb spends three hundred pages discussing why it is hard, if not impossible to predict a Black Swan.  An issue is that Taleb does this using a rhetorical style that is unfamiliar to business books - stream of conscious.  You get a delightful mix of well thought out insight, personal observation, pet peeves, and ranting.  In that regard I feel that I have now had dinner with Mr. Taleb after reading the book.<br /><br />This book is rapidly becoming the \\"hot\\" book for the pseudo intellectuals in business.  People sending copies out to others drive sales but do not change thinking or the way people work.  As a case in point, I talked with a business man on a plane who was reading this book and said \\"I am thirty pages in, and not getting much out of it.\\"<br /><br />If someone gives you this book, I would suggest accepting their gift and commenting how thoughtful they are.  I would not suggest re-gifting or buying and distributing to other colleagues.  If a consultant comes to tell you that they can help you find the next Black Swan be aggressive and point out that by definition they cannot be seen, cannot be predicted, and ask the consultants to put 100% of their fee at risk based on the revenues you will generate from capturing the Black Swan idea.  If that does not cause them to run away, then they have either not read the book, or more likely not understood what it says.<br /><br />This book runs the significant risk of being a nice book for the bookshelf and never read. In that regard it will become a peculiar part of Umberto Eco's library -- a book I have but have not or could not get through.  In either case it becomes part of the anti-library in terms of books I have not read.  Does that make it an anti-book?<br /><br />This book is not written, nor edited for that matter, for public consumption.  It is a peculiarly academic book from someone who lambastes academia.  Unfortunately you need to know a fair amount in order to understand and extract value from this book.  For example if you do not know who are Popper, Hayek, Samuelson, Poincare and several other people else you will not understand what Taleb is talking about.  He leaves out many people who I thought he would have been a fan of, such as Milton Freidman and others who take a market based approach.<br /><br />This book is part philosophy, part business and all Taleb.  If you are a fan of his great, if you are trying to understand his ideas, then I would look to the article in the New York Times.<br /><br />The idea of the Black Swan is compelling, easy to understand, and easy to talk about.  That is the allure of this book, but that is not what this book delivers.  Black Swans are now the rage of the intellectual discussions, dinner parties and a way to one-up each other by being in the \\"know\\".  The irony here is that Taleb goes to great lengths to point out that by its very nature you cannot know, nor predict the next Black Swan.<br /><br />Feel free to use that as an antidote to the black swan when it comes up at your next cocktail party.or that matter, for public consumption.

B0002BO05S|3.0|A beautiful and reverent film, nearly undone by its glacial pace and unfortunate filming location.<br /><br />First and foremost, though, it must be said that Max von Sydow makes an excellent Jesus, portraying him with grace and sincerity. Director George Stevens deliberately cast the (then unknown) Sydow as Christ, preferring not to let audiences come in with any preconceived notions about the role. Sydow is the emotional center of the film (as he should be), and his penetrating and thoughtful performance make up for many of the film's glaring flaws, which we will now discuss.<br /><br />First off, the running time. This film is quite long and very slow-moving. Stevens didn't want any melodrama or flashy action scenes in his film, but instead wanted to present a simple retelling of the story of Jesus as presented in the Gospels. While this is certainly an admirable goal, it did in this case lead Stevens to create a somber and deliberately-paced screenplay, resulting in a rather lifeless and plodding film.<br /><br />One infamous feature of the film is its many, many guest stars. Stevens takes us on a journey from Jesus' baptism to his resurrection, and casts a cavalcade of film stars of the time in little cameo roles, ranging from the sublime (Charlton Heston as John the Baptist), to the ridiculous (John Wayne as a Roman centurion). This seemingly endless parade of the movie stars of yesteryear eventually leaves the impression that one is watching some sort of strange biblical \\"Love Boat\\" rerun, rather than a legitimate epic film. This kind of stunt casting is really a distraction, and a major flaw of the film.<br /><br />The other major flaw is the setting. While the sets and costumes are excellent, and the beautiful widescreen cinematography adds weight and presence to the movie, by choosing to film in the American West instead of the Middle East (mostly for logistical reasons), Stevens managed somehow to turn his Bible epic into what looks like a Hollywood western. There are many shots of Jesus and the apostles posed in otherwise stunning Biblical tableaux (often resembling classic oil paintings), set against the backdrop of what looks to be the Grand Canyon at times. The effect is jarring, and takes the viewer right out of what should be an engrossing film experience.<br /><br />George Stevens clearly made this film from his heart, and despite its many flaws it deserves viewing for its reverent and straightforward approach. Its slow pace will probably turn off many viewers, but it remains one of the few Bible epics that is not campy or over-the-top, so for that reason it is a bit more legitimate as a true Bible film, as opposed to other epic spectacles such as Ben-Hur or Ten Commandments, which though entertaining, are full of Hollywood glamour and melodrama.sus and the apostles posed in otherwise stunning Biblical tableaux (often resembling classic oil paintings), set against the backdrop of what looks to be the Grand Canyon at times.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I absolutely love this LCD arm.  When I was looking for a new LCD monitor, I was shocked to find that most of the LCDs on the market today do not have the ability to rotate to portrait mode.  That feature is really only found on the Dell ultrasharp LCDs, which cost much more than most LCDs on the market today.      After doing some research, I came across the Ergotron website and found the \\"new\\" model of this arm for double the cost of the one listed above.  The model listed above is last years model, but the only real difference is the style/looks.  I still say this arm is very stylish.    In the box, you will find all the parts needed to mount the arm a variety of ways.  The most common way is to clap it to the rear of your worksurface, but a grommet is also included so that you could drill a hole through your surface and clamp it to the hole.    The arm is very strong (the manufacturer says it can hold up to a 20\\", but I am using a 22\\" samsung 226BW widescreen LCD with no problems).  The arm can be lowered or raised 6-8\\" (maybe more), and the LCD can be tilted up/down, and rotated.  All this can be done without having to move any cables.    If you are looking for a great way to easily turn your LCD from landscape to portrait mode, this is a great choice.  It makes reading documents (PDFs, websites, etc) much easier (especially if you have a widescreen LCD).
0385340540|1.0|This was a VERY disappointing read.  Most of the book, I would say well over half, was Grisham letting us know how much HE knows about Italy and Italian food.  He seemed particularly impressed with pastries. Mr. Grisham has also, apparently, picked up some of the language and felt it necessary to show that off as well.    The characters are not well developed and the plot, though very interesting on the surface, is thinly followed.  In the end, well, actually, it DOESN'T end.  The story really just fades out.  I was stunned to find out the last chapter was, in fact, the LAST chapter!    There was a lot of potential to the story, but I have the impression Mr. Grisham wrote it while on vacation in Italy and, when he left, lost interest in the book.    A poor read.
1594489505|5.0|\\"The Kite Runner\\" was an elegant example of modern literature; with a new author writing fiction surrounded by the chaos and difficulty of the tribulations of Afghanistan.  I learned so much from reading it.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when Hosseini's second novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" tells the tale of two unfortunate women, truly second class citizens of Afghanistan, caught in the maelstrom in the decades when the Soviet Union invaded; were defeated by the Mujahadeen; who were in turn displaced by the Taliban...the Taliban backing the forces of Al Quaeda, which brought the wrath of America down on Afghanistan after 9/11/2001.<br /><br />With this backdrop, Hosseini describes the entwined lives of women of two generations, Mariam, born in the 50's, and Laila, born as the Soviets invaded.  Brought together in a neighborhood that is destroyed by warfare, held together by a misogynist husband, Rasheed, Mariam and Laila are raised in diametrically different ways, but share a loss of hope and deprivation that will deeply affect most readers.<br /><br />It is a story of love and faith in each other, in sacrifice and bloodshed that will stay with you long after you close the cover.  And as you learn more about a world far away, a world that has been torn apart on the other side of the globe, you can't help but draw the parallel to what has and will happen to Iraq.  Hosseini's love for his homeland, and his superb prose and characterization should keep this book on top of the charts, in line for many distinguished fiction awards, and in our memories for months and months to come.<br /><br />Best book I've read this year!
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Well, the only thing that I can say to reviews below is that arguing that James Iha wasn't a song-writer is nothing short of erroneous. I was actually one of the people who didn't care how the lineup of a \\"reunited\\" band would turn out since it wasn't like Iha and Darcy Wretzky would want to come back anyway. Now I've got that out of the way. The record, apart from being credited as a Smashing Pumpkins release for the first time in seven years, is not particularly extraordinary. The interesting thing is that while the guitars are back, it sounds more like Queens of the Stone Age with Billy singing than the actual first two Smashing Pumpkins releases.    While I don't think it holds a candle to the first four albums, it is in many ways superior to the scattershot [[ASIN:B000042OI4 MACHINA/The Machines of God]] and the songs are pretty well put together. It may seem like a crowd pleaser to some, as the more \\"rock\\" songs tend to be in the first half and more of the keyboard-laced songs are toward the end. And truth be told there is some pretty good moments. I hear that \\"That's the Way (My Love Is)\\" will be the album's next single and on top of being catchy is a great pop type song from Corgan.    Perhaps the centrepice of the record though is \\"United States.\\" It is the longest song on the record and perhaps all for the better. The riffage reminds me of the psychedelic hard rock of older releases. Another great highlight on the record is the gorgeous closer \\"Pomp and Circumstance,\\" which to me, is aural bliss, like a song that must have come from heaven. Not that it's my favorite song from them, but it gives you that sort of feel. There is a sort of political undercurrent to the record and it's one thing that did make me a bit skeptical. However, it seems that Billy can make anything sound like a personal record which is one reason this works fine for some of the fans.    On the downside, I wonder if the release was a bit rushed, something I never thought I'd be sayingabout a Pumpkins release. It seems like more is put to the tracks. That being said for the first time since [[ASIN:B000000W6F Gish]] has an album come out that wouldn't make an ADD-diagnosed listener pass out. That being said, the ambition was always one of Billy Corgan's strengths and his heart gave the songs their feel, showing the band did in fact have integrity.    Another let down is that some of the \\"bonus\\" tracks on other releases are actually better than at least half of the songs on this record, which makes me wonder if Billy's learned from the mistakes of seven years ago. This also makes me hope for a commerical single release or something. And while this didn't have me holding my breath, something like releasing \\"Mashed Potatoes\\" commercially would do that trick. That being said it's 2007, and Billy wants to play Smashing Pumpkins tracks again.
B000PFUA9G|5.0|I suspect the reviewer who gave the album one star doesn't know what he's talking about!    5th Gear is just Brad. It's a Brad Paisley record, it's fun, serious, romantic and sweet and all in a perfectly shaped package. The only big disappointment is that there was nothing to match \\"She's Everything\\" from Time Well Wasted, but all in all, an amazing album, and deserves one of my album of the year accolades.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I watched this again recently after purchasing it and was reacquainted with this lovely film. It is a sweet fable about personal freedom and the simple enjoyment of life. The acting is superb all the way around from the always great Judi Densch and Alfred Molina to the small but vital work of Johnny Depp (nice guitar work on the Robert Johnson and Django medley!)and culminates in the excellence of Juliette Binoche. It is a  shame that her subtle and understated elegance lost out to the over-the-top performance by Julia Roberts for the Academy Award.<br />The pacing, the tender storyline, the acting, the gorgeous scenery, and the precise musical scoring allow for a total abandonment of the self so that one can revel in the deliciousness of this film. Chocolat is rich, warm, and satisfying.
B00004VVN9|4.0|I've always wanted to see this movie, and I finally did.  Part of the reasons for interest included Chris Walken (I became a fan of his through \\"The Dead Zone\\", a movie where he played a similar role), and because of its theme.  I noticed this DVD has a suggested pairing with Dreamscape, because they have similar themes, about the ability to enter another's thoughts and the risk of our government abusing it.<br /><br />The movies are different.  Dreamscape deal with people with paranormal abilities that are augmented by the government, while Brainstorm deals with technilogical advances by everyday people.  Dreamscape effectively deals with the moral issues in the setting of a quick paced adventure.  Brainstorm is more cerebal, slow plodding, and attempts to be more focussed on the mental side.<br /><br />I read an editorial review pointing the weakness in the characterizations.  There are little sidebars that attempt to make the characters come alive (the chain smoking of Louise Fletcher's character, the fancy bicycle of Chris Walken's, the classical piano playing of Natalie Wood's), but they lack the depth of emotion as Chris Walken's Johnny Smith of \\"The Dead Zone\\", which gives you less real concern of the characters.<br /><br />The plot is a little fuzzy as well.  Part of the ending, where the hero thwarts the sinister plans of our government is almost comical in a good way, providing some comic relief, but the final dealing with the characters is confusing and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The sinister government agenda is not clear either.  It shows a misuse but never gets to how it will be misused, not creating a real danger, as opposed as the dangers in other movies of the era that pick on our government (\\"Blue Thunder\\", \\"Dreamscape\\", and to a much lesser extent \\"Firestarter\\").  I do find it interesting how often our government is villainized.  True, we have the potential of becoming villainous, but the fact that filmmakers have the freedom to villainize the government shows ours is not as villainous as countries that deny the right to dissent.<br /><br />The special effects are effective; I disagree that they overpower the characters.  The problem, I feel, is in the writing of the characters.  Even with top line actors they are not given the opportunity to shine.inous as countries that deny the right to dissent.

0440178002|3.0|I am amazed at how many reviewers said things like \\"I couldn't put it down!\\" or some such thing. In my case, I TOILED over this book, rarely reading it with any voracity, instead plodding along hoping for something, that magic moment when I would get the reason why so much frothing adoration is heaped upon it. After 500 pages or so, it became a personal challenge to finish it so I wouldn't feel as if I'd wasted so much time!<br />Yes, there is a complex plot and there are many details of the differences between cultures, however the whole west meets east and philosophical epiphanies abound approach is tired and condescending. I get the concept as does every gai-jin to spend time in Japan or anyone who has ever taken the time to explore the other half of the globe. Couple that problem with the fantasty cliche of the Westerner falling in love with the mysterious exotic Japanese beauty and the near lurid obsession with sex and you get a novel that is far too long, far too superficially reverent, and far too contrived. It is not horrible but neither is it a masterpiece of fiction. I would rather read something vastly shorter or at least compelling enough to justify the amount of time one puts into this brick of a book. Thud.
1568494173|3.0|This is the definitive science fiction novel, exploring every major theme that fits the genre -- extraterrestial intelligent life, man's reach for the stars, the paradox of machines (robots/computers) through which man evolves but which threaten to destroy him, and, ultimately, the evolution of the mind past physical restraints.  Most importantly, the book explains the movie's completely nonsensical ending.  Indeed, the book perhaps explains too much and, as is a common problem with this genre, the author doesn't have time for character development.  Still, Clarke's imagination and vision are extraordinary and the book holds ones attention.  I definitely recommend it.

From the opening line to the end, I always felt I was present in the action.

Basically it is a western (set in the far future in space), about down and outers, on the edge of society, just trying to survive with their honour intact.  They are not there to save humanity, just survive.    It is an interesting world, cross of western and space.  Culture is heavily influenced by Chinese, the values placed on items is different (food and supplies are of more value than gold)  It is all quite believable.    I would recommend it.

0316018953|4.0|Stanley Kent is a medical physicist. A dead one. Two bullets in the back of the head, execution style on the overlook above Mulholland dam in LA. Harry Bosch is assigned the case. While at the crime scene he is joined by an old friend, FBI Special Agent Rachael Walling who also has an interest in Mr. Kent.    Walling is a member of the FBI Tactical Intelligence Unit. She quickly educates Harry to the fact that what appears to be a murder may be a part of a terroisim plot. Kent, in his line of work has access to radioactive materials. The kind that can be used to build a dirty bomb.    A visit to Kent's home finds his wife naked, gagged and hog tied. She relates a story of two masked men breaking into the home, sending Kent an E-mail containing a picture of his wife and instructions to obtain as much cesium as is available to him and to bring it to the Mulholland overlook or else his wife will be killed.     Kent's activities are traced and it is clear that he has done as requested. The Feds are now looking for terroists who may be intent on buillding and setting off a dirty bomb. Bosch is still looking for the murderer, figuring that if you find one, you find both.    Tensions develop between the FBI unit and Bosch's investigation. Serious ones.    To tell you more about how this all plays out would be to spoil a very good story. My only complaint about the book is that it is a bit short, having been originally written in serial form for the NYT Sunday Magazine and rewritten and expanded into this book.    Michael Connelly remains an author worth reading and the novels invoving Harry Bosh remain his most entertaining.

B00000K19E|5.0|1999's \\"The Matrix\\" wed ground-breaking special effects to a highly original sci-fi concept, propelling a capable cast through a unique journey to another reality.<br /><br />\\"The Matrix\\" opens with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, software technician by day, computer hacker by night, in search of a sign that will lead to meaning in his life.  A sign does come, over his computer, leading him to a momentous meeting with Morpheus (played by Laurence Fishburne), who challenges his understanding of reality.  Before he even has a chance to digest Morpheus' revelation, Neo is arrested by agents of a shadowy government agency.  His rescue by Morpheus and his companions, including Trinity (Carrie Ann Moss), leads Neo to two stunning realizations: that the reality in which he has been living is a computer-generated fraud called the Matrix, and that he has a destiny beyond his existance in that computer-generated world.<br /><br />Neo's journey toward understanding of his destiny will take him through a series of exciting adventures in and out of cyber-space, toward a violent confrontation with Agent Smith, the snarling leader of those who protect the illusion of the Matrix.  Along the way, the viewer will be treated to some spectacular kung fu sequences as Neo learns to use his new powers, and the famous and visually stunning shootout in multiple dimensions in the lobby of a building where Neo and Trinity go to rescue Morpheus.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a quantum leap forward in the special effects of the day, and as an exciting science fiction story.

B000E1ZBGS|2.0|The only reason I gave this film two stars is that I thought the scenery and cinematography was beautiful. Other than that, I was very disappointed. I tried watching this with an open mind (OK..it may not be exactly true to the book, but try to judge it on its own merit.) Well I'm sorry this movie had no merit. Acting was lame (even though many of the actors in this movie have done great work in the past), and obviously the writers made no effort to at least try to remain true to the original story at least a little bit. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is one of my favorite novels, but this film did it no justice whatsoever.
0586091718|1.0|This book is all about psychic experiences. The writer tries to explain them by introducing in the first chapter only, a concept of holography, fetched from physics. This reasoning is far-fetched, certainly not scientific, and is based on fallacy: the writer only picks from here and there \\"results from studies\\" that support his views. He has no self-criticism and does not mention any arguments against his views. Not scientific, not worth buying. (I bought it thinking I bought a physics book. No so. I read it, then threw it away).

B000PTYPAC|2.0|Paramore is all about Hayley Williams, and that shows pretty bad on Riot!, the band's second album.  The music is as plain and generic as it gets, sounding like just about every other pop rock/emo band out there right now.  Hayley is a decent singer, and the melodies, although nothing groundbreaking, are actually quite decent.  Unfortunately fairly good melodies never have, and never will make up for poor lyrics.  Williams tries to be witty but ends up sounding whiny and overly cynical (think Anberlin without the clever word plays).  At the end of the day this is good music for teens who THINK that they're rockers (fans of the Academy Is, Cute Is What We Aim For, etc) but are actually good pop kids.  Skip this if you listen to real music.
0553296981|4.0|At first thought, the story of Anne Frank is terribly depressing.  A young girl being trapped in the \\"Secret Annexe\\" for two years; never feeling the wind on her face or breathing fresh air, food shortages, and whispering every word for fear of being captured.  Not to mention extremely crabby housemates like Mrs. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel. But when pondering over the thought, Anne Frank's legacy has lived on far beyond her wish  \\"I want to go on living after my death.\\"  Not only did she go on living but she became an icon to many young girls around the world.<br />  I would recommend this book to ages 10 and up. When the book was translated from German into English a few words may be a little confusing for those under age 10. What truly amazed me was that Anne Frank had such great writing skills. She had wanted to be a writer when she grew up and I thought it was very interesting that she wrote a diary as a sort of practice piece for the work that she planned on doing when she grew up. Yet, in reality, it was her diary which became famous. I really enjoyed Anne's story but found it slow near the middle of the book and had hoped for a little more action, although I know you can not change a true diary to make it more interesting. I am glad I chose this book and I encourage others to read it, too.

Skip this if you listen to real music.
6302878527|5.0|this is a very interesting movie. it tells the story of Hepburn's and Finney's relationship and marriage simultaneously; the past and the future. so, one minute they're showing their relationship when it was fresh, and happy, and then after 5-10 mins it cuts to their married life where things have changed. but it's not confusing or anything, the past and future scenes all relate to each other. like if they're in a restaurant when they were just dating, it will cut to a restaurant scene when they're married. the whole point of the movie is to show how time and married life changes a relationship. what i found intriguing was the way the camera cuts back and forth to tell the story. they really did a good job with that! i also enjoyed this because of the beautiful sights; they are in France and the scenery is so beautiful (the beaches, restaurants). And Albert Finney is about the most handsome man i've ever seen! so handsome!! i'm happy i watched this movie to have discovered him. audrey is still pretty but you can see she's aged and older. she's lost that youthful look. and she's very thin in this. i think she's too skinny. the stunning jacqueline bisset has a little role in it. you have to see her close-ups; that woman is just beautiful! i higly reccomend anyone to watch this movie. it's not groundbreaking or Oscar worthy (in my opinion; though it went on to win an Oscar), but it's a great movie to curl up and watch; entertaining, enjoyable and educates at the same time.
1594489505|4.0|This book was very enjoyable.  I was sad to finish it and not continue on the journey with the main characters.  I think it shows that all people want the same thing regardless of race or religion.  The historical context made it that much more interesting to read.    Since so much has changed in Afghanistan in the last year with the Taliban and Al Qaida making a comeback, I think another book with these characters should be in the works.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|That's the question that I first began asking myself years ago, after seeing \\"Blue Velvet\\" for the first time.  His films befuddle me, aggravate me, mesmerize me, and keep me coming back for more.  Originally, one of his films that I found the most infuriatingly obscure, \\"Mulholland Drive\\", I have now seen at least twenty times.  It's come to be possibly my favorite movie of all time, and I understand the plot almost perfectly (I think!).  But of course there's always more to know.  He's challenged me to understand concepts in a less linear, literal way, and to trust my instincts.  Lynch is all about diving into the endless subconscious: there's no limit to how far you can go.  Sometimes, I feel David Lynch is less of a motion picture director, and more of an abstract painter, using film instead of canvas.  No one asks why Picasso created lopsided people, or why Van Gogh saw everything in broad hyper-colors.  There are the same interesting themes that run through Lynch's works.  All of them have a dreamlike, nightmarish quality: beautiful and yet terrifying.  They all seem (to me) to prey on our universal fear of mortality, taking us to the brink of death, then grabbing us back to reality...and life.  Perhaps David has more in common with the painter Edvard Munch.<br /><br />Yet, I was stunned with disillusion when I saw \\"Inland Empire\\" on the big screen.  As weird and indecipherable as Lynch's works are (I thought nothing could top \\"Eraserhead\\" or \\"Fire Walk With Me\\" in that department), \\"Empire\\" really pushes the envelope into The Twilight Zone.  I couldn't follow the vague, impromptu screenplay at all.  Some of the choices David made seemed deranged, even for him.  Why was \\"The Phantom\\" mentioned, then dropped entirely?  What happened to the murdered actor and actress from the first version of \\"On High On Blue Tomorrows\\"?  What was the reason behind Laura Dern's hideous print dresses?  Who was the homicidal woman with the screwdriver?  Why the subtitles for homeless people, when they could be understood perfectly?<br /><br />Have I peaked your interest yet?  Despite I.E.'s three-hour running time, I was never bored for one second.  And, as always, I could not stop thinking about it.  Lynch inspires thought, conversation, and controversy.  That's a mark of greatness.<br /><br />There were many things I loved, loved, loved in \\"Empire\\".  The ominous, loopy gypsy neighbor played by Grace Zabriskie was worth my ten bucks alone.  Some of the technical shots---Laura Dern running head-on into the camera's view in slow-motion, then suddenly speeding up like a 747; Susan (Laura) shooting an approaching menace, who then turns into her own image as she fires the gun, the grotesquely made-up face disolving like a melting clown.  Pure genius. Surprisingly, I totally got the sit-com with the people in rabbit suits, the laugh track, and the woman watching all of this on a TV while she weeps.  It connects (in my mind) to Susan's death among the homeless, while we, the real audience, laugh at their innocuous conversation.<br /><br />Ultimately, David Lynch would reach a far wider, more appreciative viewer population if he didn't seem to deliberately strive to be so odd.  But then, what would there be to talk about???<br /><br />So should David Lynch be taken seriously?  I think I just answered my own question.  Can't WAIT for the DVD, so I can see it again...and again...le, when they could be understood perfectly?      Have I peaked your interest yet?

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Great deliver and quality of product.  Goods in original condition when arrived, sealed as advertised.
B00008CLOA|5.0|The SACD stereo and 5.1 surround versions of Dark Side of the Moon are the only way currently available to experience this album as Pink Floyd intended it to be heard. If you don't have an SACD player or a DVD player that plays SACDs and don't intend to buy one,  don't buy this album.  The regular CD version sounds better.  The CD layer on this is too compressed and too loud and might be OK in a noisy car with the windows open, but forget about it on even a low quality home system.  I say this as someone who loves Dark Side of the Moon.    I have thought that Dark Side of the Moon is one of the finest albums ever made for over 30 years.  I have 2 copies of the British SQ Quad version, an unopened backup and a copy I play on rare occasions.  I also have one opened and 2 still-sealed Stereo LP pressings.  All 5 of these are British Harvest pressings circa 1977.  I also have an opened and a sealed Mobile Fidelity LP pressing, and my original American Capital pressing.  In my opinion the late 70s British Stereo pressings beat all comers.  The MFSL is crisper and has more detail but, fatally, less atmosphere.  But it is a good second choice and occasionally a good alternate listen.  The British Quad pressing has cleaner, quieter surfaces than the American Capital and is clearly a different (but inferior) mix, which makes for an interesting alternate listen on a rare occasion, but the sound quality and mix are actually better on the American Capital.  If you are listening for sound quality, the SQ is a poor fourth among these 4 versions.  If you want quad or surround, any of the other 3 played through Dynaquad or Dolby Surround or some other ambiance recovery arrangement gives a much more satisfying experience.  My comments on British pressings are limited to late 1970s pressings.  I say this because I picked up a British stereo pressing of Wish You Were Here about 1986 and it sounds muffled compared to my Japanese stereo and British Quad pressings from the 70s, so I wouldn't vouch for later British pressings, though it is possible they may be satisfactory on Dark Side.  The British Quad pressing of Wish You Were Here stands with the British Stereo pressing of Dark Side in terms of sound quality and quality of listening experience.  The mix is different from and superior to the stereo version of Wish You Were Here, whether played back in stereo or in quad (and I wish Sony would release it on SACD).     Because my LPs sounded so good I never bothered to get CD versions of most of Pink Floyd, though I did pick up the Mobile Fidelity Gold CD of Dark Side, and later the Doug Sax remastered CD Box set, Shine On, which includes many but not all of the albums.  I occasionally listen to some of them but mostly I still listen to the vinyl versions.  Except...    The SACD.  In addition to the lousy sounding CD layer, you have 2 choices on the SACD layer, Stereo, or a new 5.1 channel mix from the original multi-track analog masters.  Earlier I said that late 70s British Stereo LP pressings beat all comers.  Let me qualify that.  The stereo SACD version equals it.  It is very difficult to hear any difference between my always carefully played 1977 British Stereo pressing and the SACD stereo tracks (except there is some very slight surface noise on the LP--but it is not yet objectionable enough to make me break the seal on one of my other copies).  Old British stereo pressings are basically going to be impossible to find.  This is a worthy substitute.  There is also the new 5.1 channel mix.  If you like surround sound you'll love this.  I love surround sound and listen to most stereo sources with Dynaquad passive ambiance recovery.  This new surround mix is about equal to the stereo mix but different, exchanging a little more clarity for a little less of the mysterious.  It is a worthy alternative (unlike the old SQ version).  I listen to both.    So buy this SACD while it is still available if you like this music.  If you don't have an SACD player, don't listen to it yet.  But get yourself one of the universal DVD players that plays SACD (and DVD-A, too, preferably) and you are in for a treat.  And some of the dedicated SACD players sound even better.  Let me repeat: the SACD stereo and 5.1 surround versions of Dark Side of the Moon are the only way currently available to experience this album as Pink Floyd intended it to be heard.

0694003611|5.0|I read this book to my 16-month old son every day. He never tires of it. I don't either. There is something magical and wonderfully comforting in both its illustrations and its text. We have many boardbooks but this is our favorite. It was exciting to learn its little secrets like the mouse appearing at different spots and the moon rising on each next page. It is so simple but yet such a great little book.
0316067598|5.0|Written with both compassion and humor injected where appropriate, reflecting a true sense of heroism on the part of all of these men.  These men are doing exactly what they have been trained to do, without hesitation or selfishness, they are taking the fight to the enemy.  God bless Marcus for surviving, it was not his time.  My thoughts and prayers continue to be with the families of those who lost their loved ones.  I am close to these men everyday and have the utmost respect for them, for how they got to where they are, for what they do, for what they stand for and above all for what they are willing to sacrifice so that our flags can fly in our yards daily. Never underestimate the power of our freedom, nor the power of our enemy, and don't for one second think the enemy will not return to U.S. soil.  Thank you Marcus for pouring your soul into this incredible story, I'm sure it was tough.  I laughed and cried throughout this book, it is an incredible read and a necessary reminder of the ugly and ruthless terrorist we are at war with.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|My wife and I loved the film, so had to get the soundtrack. Since then I've given it to two friends.    Every song is gorgeous. Both the male and female vocals are filled with emotion. (Maybe more than some people would be comfortable with.) You might have to see the film to really appreciate all of the lyrics and soulful renditions. But several of the songs would make my playlist any day.    Stunningly original.
0891419063|5.0|I've read a number of WWII books.  With The Old Breed was different, a first hand account of the guys in the mud, stench of dead bodies, barbarism of the enemy, harrible casualty rates,etc..  Could not put it down.
1582701709|1.0|This is possibly the worst book ever bound, ever. The idea behind it is good but its execution is terrible. Positive thinking generates a greater chance of success in your life; no problem there. But to claim that desire without work or making plans to reach your goals is not only foolish, it is also a dangerous thought system. Just another cheesy self-help book that throws responsibility to the wind and promotes a seemingly lazy faith in the world around you. The most amusing thing of all, however, is when one of the speaker in the DVD format of this book claims that you \\"can get something out of nothing!\\" Looks like someone needs to take another physics class or at least a critical thinking course.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|When I saw Clive Davis talk about Art as the selling of millions of units of product on the final American Idol show (6th season), I found him crass, vulgar and offensive. I didn't actually realize, however, that he was implicitly snubbing Kelly Clarkson. And in response to that kind of struggle - artist vs mogul (expression vs exploitation) - I'm far from alone, I suspect, in finding myself coming down strongly on the side of the artist. I may not have purchased this album otherwise - maybe I'd have had my daughter burn me a few songs from it - but I enthusiastically bought it under these circumstances, with no regrets.     That having been said, there is something missing here that was in abundance on Kelly's first two albums, namely seasoned songwriting. It's hard to tell how much of a role Kelly has played in the writing on her first two albums, but my guess would be that  she had far less help this time around. There are few hooks - none to match those embedded in something of the caliber of Breakaway. The melodies are less infectious and tend to be a bit repetitious. They don't have that crafted grace that good pop music has - even edgy, rockier stuff like this. The other side of the coin, however, is that there is a more intensely personal presence to this CD than was there on her first two offerings. I was struck by an abundance of sincerity, honesty and integrity. The feelings come across as raw and authentic. As the first word of the album title suggests, this stuff is very personal.     My December was obviously an important part of Kelly Clarkson's artistic journey and it needed to be made. Some of the tracks are achingly sweet, though always wistful, poignant or downright depressing. Sober and Irvine are standouts. Her incredible, soulful voice does occasionally veer toward being shrill but more often delivers uncompromising emotional power and authority. She clearly felt this music deeply and so does this listener. I'm surprised that Mr. Davis, in allhis years of so-called experience, hasn't yet learned that allowing the artist to be true to her vision will ultimately serve her growth, maturity, and yes, Clive, ultimately even quite likely her earning potential. A lot of artists come to mind who went against the grain and stood up for their artistic vision. Here are a few: There was Dylan, reigning king of the folk music purists, going electric and thus leaving them in the dirt, wide-eyed, disillusioned and fingers in their ears, Brian Wilson abandoning the Beach Boys' Big Money making car/surf formula and alienating himself from Capitol Records (and fellow band member Mike Love) by writing and producing Pet Sounds, which sold miserably at the time and is now at the top of everyone's list of all-time great albums, Joni Mitchell moving on to a louder, jazzier, more esoteric sound, Van Morrison doing a straight honky tonk album, Elvis Costello putting out a record with only his voice and the Brodsky String Quartet (as well as a handful of other projects that stretched his audience's listening abilities) and, to come full-circle, Bryan Ferry recently putting out a great CD of all Dylan covers. Great musicians all, and everyone of them in retrospect having been true to the inner vision, which is the essence of great art anyway.  Contrary (in a way) to the name of her newest CD, Kelly Clarkson is only 25 and in the early stages of delivering on her awesome promise. There's a lot more to the story yet to be written and I look forward to it all!
B000NA1OXY|3.0|The first song rocks. Every single other song is so bad, I cannot believe it is the same artist. If she had any integrity, she would not even have recorded them.
B0002TT0NW|3.0|So, I'm a BIG Harry Potter Fan, and even with the cast changes and directorial differences, I was a fan of this movie over all.     Stop reading here if you haven't read the book!!!      HOWEVER - I feel that a major part of the story was left unexplained!  That being the identity of the creators of the Marauder's Map; Moony, Padfoot, Wormtail, and Prongs.   In the book much more is explained about Harry's father and the relationship he had with his fellow students (the Professors with whom Harry is now interacting).  Also, the history behind why Pettigrew, James, and Sirius became animagus (to empathize with Lupin).  It would have taken only a few minutes for one of the chracters to explain to Harry about the map, perhaps in the scene with Lupin at the end when he returns the map to Harry. All the back story fits - nothing contradicts the book, they just didn't bother putting the explanation in there, and I thought it was very important to the story.  Maybe they have saved this information for the 4th movie, I haven't watched it yet - but I felt that was a serious omission on the part of this film.  Otherwise, I found it entertaining and true to the book.
B000RGSOR8|5.0|This wonderful debut starts off with three songs (\\"Now Now,\\" \\"Jesus Saves, I Spend,\\" and \\"Your Lips Are Red\\") that one might describe as alternative pop:  quirky, sometimes edgy, with lots of instruments (various guitars, some quite distorted, keys, violin, bass, drums) that add texture yet manage to maintain lots of space.  These qualities are only accentuated by the songs' live performances, in which St. Vincent, a/k/a Annie Clark, utilizes robotic movements (I saw her in NYC last night).  But while this may all sound cold, it is far from that; rather, there is something that is intense and uplifting.  As if to make the latter point, the CD moves on to its fourth song, \\"Marry Me,\\" a jazz/pop, upbeat ballad.  The rest of the CD is a mixture of what might be described as Fiona Appleesque, alternative jazz (\\"Paris Is Burning\\"), a country-like ballad (\\"All My Stars Aligned\\"), more alternative pop (\\"Apocalypse Song\\"), a moving instrumental (\\"We Put A Pearl In The Ground\\"), jazzy ballads (\\"Landmines,\\" and \\"What We Worry\\"), and upbeat jazz (\\"Human Racing\\").    The music is complex and varied, the lyrics intelligent.  The songs are instantly memorable -- a pretty rare quality!    Oh, and did I mention Annie's voice -- Saint-like!
B000OQF6N6|2.0|All credit aside to Billy Corgan being a multi-talented muscian that didnt need D'arcy or Iha to write this album, I guess it shows when creative juices just do not seem to work.     Listening to this album almost had me in tears, I really love smashing pumpkins and ANYTHING by them right up to Machina II, but this is just a sham of an album.    It kind of goes everywhere, there seems to be no real thought to track placement or that original grimey hum that followed the SP sound for many years that made it stand out as unique.    What was Corgan thinking? The SP legacy is what will sell this album without a doubt, but I cant help but feel this album is too far a stretch for classification of a good SP album.    Maybe if they used the Zwan label on this as it stands miles ahead of Mary Sea of the Star, but cannot compare to anything by the smashing pumpkins history.    I'll give it a few more listening sessions considering my past with SP music in my teen years, but this album could easily have been missed.    2 stars because there are a few songs that are good (about two, possibly three) but otherwise a very plain, average album that if you are expecting something like what the produced in the past you will be in for a rude shock.
B00005JPFC|3.0|I have always been a huge fan of Pixar films but I was a little disappointed with Ratatouille.<br /><br />The animation was by far the best of any CG film to date.  They have finally perfected hair and water.  The scenes of Paris, especially at night, and the action sequence in the sewer were great and deserve to be seen on the big screen.<br /><br />But I was not captivated by the story.  There is way too much violence for the very young (A shotgun-blasting grandmother, dead rats in shop window, a female chef threatening to kill another co-worker, just to name a few)and not enough adult humor for the grown-ups. In fact, there was very little laughter in the theater throughout the film.  I hope that Pixar's next film, WALL E (summer 2008) returns to the style of Monsters Inc, The Incredibles and Cars - films which had something for everyone.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|That is all that can be said for Sara Bareilles' \\"little voice\\" although when it comes to Sara neither her voice nor her talent is little. She is a Fiona Apple meets Sarah Mclachlan and add a dash of kelly clarkson (wierd combination right?) That works so well. With catchy lyrics and songs you want to dance in your swivel chair at work for, Sara Bareilles has made a huge acheivement and a even bigger impression on the Music world!

Amazing animals shot from angles that keep making you ask yourself, \\"How did they get that?\\"  Also, they delve into areas that you could not pay me enough to step into film, but so glad someone did venture into those caves to show me a world that is unimaginable.  BLU RAY this one all they way.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|Having read previous reviews of this CD which appear on this website, I would have to say that I strongly disagree with what people are saying.  People who have said that this soundtrack has no thematic material need to listen more carefully, for Hooper has been subtle in his writing.  I'll admit that on my first listening to the CD, I was slightly dissappointed because of similar reasons mentioned in other reviews, mainly because of the lack of thematic material and 'memorable moments'.  However, on my second listening I picked up things that I hadn't heard before, and now that I have owned the CD for a while now, it has grown on me.    The Umbridge theme is, yes, annoying, but that is its intention.  It is, however, well written and beautifully played by strong and confident strings, accompanied by accentuating chords in the brass, giving it an almost humourous touch.  The Possession theme is emotional and features throughout the soundtrack in different forms.  Chords are what makes this piece effective; dissonant chords and intervals cause uneasiness and there are many moments where the music does not go where we expect it to.  Other themes include the frantic racing cues for the Department of Mysteries, and even these cues are thematic.  If you listen carefully, the chord progression of these cues are based on the Possession theme, which I think is extremely clever.  There are also cues such as the final minute of the piece titled 'Sirius Deception' and also Dumbledore's Army and the Room of Requirement which add a fresh tone to the CD.  Although the writing is simple, is it cleverly constructed and fits in perfectly with the actual viewing of the film.      All in all, this soundtrack is suitable for anyone who will listen to it seriously and will be prepared to allow some time for it to sink in.  Although it is not music you really play in the background while doing something, it does make an enjoyable experience to listen to when really concentrating and perhaps even analysing.

I thought he and I could read it in tandem (we live together) but he had already promised it to another friend. I had to buy my own copy, which I justified because I knew my 32-year-old daughter would love it as well.<br /><br />Gilbert shares one amazing year of self-discovery in which she quit her apparently lucrative position as a writer and traveled first to Italy to eat and study Italian for the sheer pleasure of both; then to India to spend four months in an Ashram, meditating; and finally four months in Bali, where she found love on several fronts.<br /><br />We get to hear her angst about her marriage and the prospect of having children; the love affair that couldn't be; the pounds she gained and lost again; her struggles and success in learning meditation; her deep commitment to a new friend that almost backfires...all with refreshing honesty and candidness. I'm ready for a sequel.

B000PTYP7U|5.0|I am a huge fan of the band Paramore and am amazed my their talent at such a young age. The drummer, Zac, who just turned 17, is my age! I absolutely love them and although I had not heard of them when they made their debut with the album \\"All We Know Is Falling\\" back in 2005, I later fell in love with songs such as \\"Pressure,\\" \\"Emergency\\", and \\"Hear We Go Again.\\" I now own Riot! and every song is very well done with Hayley Williams amazing vocal abilties for a young 18 year old and guitarist Josh Farro and  bassist Jeremy Davis are absolutely brilliant on guitar and bass. Their live shows are amazing and they put so much energy into their performances which translates to Riot!, particularly in their single \\"Misery Business.\\"  I idolize Hayley Williams for her role as a lead singer in a rock band as well as her amazing songwriting abilities. This band has so much talent and you WILL be hearing more of Paramore for years to come.

B00008DDHZ|5.0|The tragic riot known as \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is recreated to powerful effect in this film, shot in pseudo-documentary style by Paul Greengrass. The film unfolds virtually in real-time, so the viewer feels like an eyewitness to tragedy. While not for the faint of heart, \\"Bloody Sunday\\" serves as both highly visceral shocker and edifying political drama.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Although the laser discs are more clumsy that DVDs, for some films, that's all I can get (the original unaltered Star Wars series, for instance, took forever to come to DVD). The theatrical Blade Runner version, w/ narration is a great way to see this film the first time (and yes, I also have the book on my shelf). When I show some of my friends the DVD director's cut (?), some thing's are asked about. My veiwing pleasure is interuped by questions. Shoot, if they'd seen the original version first on my laserdisc player with the narrated explanations, then there'd be no questions. I liked the first version better, including the alternate ending. I rate this new 4 disc releaase on RUMORS, but they seem to be SOLID RUMORs, and as I stated, I own both versions. In some ways Laserdiscs are better than DVDs. They are analogue instead of compressed digital, and they are not copy-protected with that Macro stuff. But I want the new set.    Now, (pretty please) bring on the 4 disc super set!!!
B000E33VWW|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny portrayal of brilliant misfit Truman Capote is reason enough to see this vivid, unnerving film, but the focus on his writing of \\"In Cold Blood\\" lets us peer into the tortured psyche of a man who always felt alone and set apart, with only his words to win him acknowledgment. Though Truman bonds with Smith as a fellow outcast (with homo-erotic undertones also evident), he also misleads and manipulates the convict to achieve his own literary ends. Collins scores as a downright spooky Smith, and Oscar-nominated Catherine Keener does a nicely measured turn as Capote's childhood friend, novice author Harper Lee. A layered, complex piece about a tragic event, and one profoundly disillusioned man who used it to create his last, most enduring work.
B00005MP58|5.0|I missed the original airing on A&E and came across the VHS version on Amazon years ago.  I watched it so many times (and rewinded) that the tapes wore out.  The DVD is excellent.  I realize it is a lot of \\"talk\\" and no action, but c'mon, it is an exact adaptation of Austen's P&P.  Of course, there are a few scenes that weren't in the book, but they make for excellent character developement.  Each character is so rich in their conversation and believability that I recommend it to everyone.    I treasure this DVD set.  I love the story, I love the actors and certainly love the era.  The music is wonderful.  I watch it over and over again.  I was so glad to see so many enjoyed this version.  The screenwriters left nothing out.      Bravo!
B00005OM4Q|5.0|Set in the early 1970s, and based on actual events in the life of writer-director Cameron Crowe--once an underage Rolling Stone scribe himself--\\"Almost Famous\\" is a beautifully observed coming-of-age drama that captures the spirit of an era with soulful warmth and bittersweet insight. Crudup, McDormand, Hudson, and wide-eyed newcomer Fugit all deliver vivid, well-rounded performances, while a brief early appearance by Philip Seymour Hoffman as real-life gonzo critic Lester Bangs remains indelible. Crowe's songs of innocence and experience will rock your world.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Adapting the script, very intelligently, from the wildly tangled novel of the same name, Liev Shrieber does an amazing job pulling the critical threads together to create a visually rich and emotionally fullfilling story about remembrance, guilt and forgiveness.  The casting, right down to the loveable and insane dog named Sammy Davis Jr. jr, is perfect.  This is a character piece and what it is more it is a very rare thing in modern cinema, a story of good ( if weird) young men.  Alex and Jonathan are sweet, kind, mixed-up and trying to understand themselves by understanding where they come from.  The counter balance between the over the top Alex and the quiet and introspective Jonathan works very well.  The changes that Shreiber makes in giving voice to Alex( the writer) and having Jonathan communicate through his collection, ties in beautifully with the ending ( in a field of sunflowers) , as well as with the way that the grandfather finally achieves absolution for his past actions.  Wood's Jonathan is an image of grace in this final interaction with the grandfather character.  Shrieber is to be applauded for what he has achieved.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Singer's ingenious noir thriller takes a twisty, complicated plot about betrayal and recrimination and turns it into a dark fable about the things we fear most: what we can't see and don't understand. Spacey won an Oscar for his unnerving portrayal of Verbal Kint, a man at once physically vulnerable and intellectually devious, but the entire cast--Byrne, Pollak, Baldwin, and a hilariously indecipherable Del Toro--bring their gallery of quirky deviants to vivid life. Bryan Singer and writer Christopher McQuarrie push the mystery past the tidy, clich&eacute;d conclusion into a most unexpected realm, making these \\"Suspects\\" anything but usual.
0399246665|5.0|My daughter loved matching the pictures to the words/shapes/colors.  She is five and eager to read.  She said \\"I am reading!\\" while reading these books.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|With a tough-talking teenage argot harkening back to the hard-boiled noir movies of the forties, and a cast of high-school-age characters with names like Dode, Tugger, and The Brain, Johnson's ingenious murder-mystery set at a Los Angeles high school is pure movie fancy. But what a clever, fascinating ruse he's devised--the plot itself is a mind twister worthy of \\"Kiss Me Deadly.\\" And the acting, like the dialogue, is utterly sincere, even at its most outrageously hip. With hands jammed in his tattered coat pockets, specs dropping down the bridge of his nose, Levitt epitomizes shabby cool. Great support from Haas, Noah Fleiss, and Norah Zehetner give this \\"Brick\\" extra heft.
B00003CXPD|5.0|nchored by Bell's soulful lead performance, \\"Billy Elliot\\" is an intelligent, often humorous coming-of-age drama by veteran stage director Daldry about masculine prejudice and the promise of escape from grinding, oppressive circumstances. Set against the backdrop of the 1984 miners' strike in Durham County, \\"Elliot\\" has an acute eye for working-class sensibilities, but the main focus of this exhilarating story concerns Billy's efforts to translate raw talent into self-realization. An irresistible mix of fancy footwork and feel-good entertainment.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|What a fun movie and a fun soundtrack!  Who knew Hugh Grant could sing? It's a gotta see movie and a fabulous soundtrack.
B0001XALTG|5.0|This witty, hallucinatory adaptation of Irvine Welsh's bestseller is an outrageously entertaining glimpse at dead-end lives, peopled with a remarkable cast of over-the-top characters who made the film an international hit. In his breakout role, McGregor is endearing as a ratty doper who just can't handle the notion of straight life, no matter how hard he tries. Boyle's energetic direction of a sterling ensemble cast--including Bremner, Miller, and \\"Full Monty\\" star Robert Carlyle, playing Mark's scornful, hard-drinking pal, Begbie--is tone-perfect, as are his inspired dramatizations of Renton's loopier, drug-induced nightmares. By turns shocking, morbid and funny, \\"Trainspotting\\" is an honest, scathing look at addiction.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|For those familiar with Dream Theater this album continues their musical domination of the progressive genre.  For those thinking about giving Dream Theater a listen, this is a great way to get familiar with their incredible talent.  The bonus DVD is worthwhile, giving you a glimpse into Mike Portnoy's creative process and an idea of how much work goes into the studio process.     My favorite album has always been Images and Words, but this one is slowly creeping into that spot.  Transitions, development and musicality all blend so well, resulting in an album that is moving, hard and fast yet still has one or two of those ballads to keep the pace manageable.      The track Constant Motion is a great example of their talent, with so many changes in key and time that you can get dizzy trying to take it all in.     Throughout the entire track there are examples of what makes Dream Theater great.  Powerful riffs and zinging notes from Petrucci's guitars, just-right vocals, oh-so complex drums, Jordan Rudess' amazing keyboard tones, and Myung's accurate bass.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|Director David Lynch is atypically restrained in rendering this heartwarming story, one you might not believe if it weren't true. Oscar-nominated Farnsworth gets the role of his career, inhabiting the weathered Alvin like a favorite old work-shirt. Alvin's full life is written all over his face; his folksy openness belies a hard-won wisdom. As we see him touch those he meets along his route, we get to know this humble man, and root for him to make it to his brother. An unadorned triumph, celebrating the power of forgiveness and human perseverance. Great family viewing.
B00003JRCQ|2.0|Am a huge Jan Austen fan but find this films leads don't have the chemistry to really sustain what is a great story love story.  The BBC do it so much better!
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Essentially a big-screen version of the PowerPoint presentation Gore has been presenting to politicians, activists, college students, and concerned citizens around the world for over a decade, \\"Truth\\" is both a teach-in and a resolute call to action. Pilloried for his wonkish stiffness in the 2000 presidential campaign, Gore here pokes fun at his own image and shows an easygoing humorous side, even during the course of explaining a deadly serious world problem. Devoid of whiz-bang spectacle, this urgent and timely film delivers exactly what it promises: the unvarnished \\"Truth,\\" however inconvenient it may be to get our heads around.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is a show about family, loyalty, faith and doubt, and commitment to a cause and to one another, all wrapped in a terrifically acted, beautifully filmed, and gorgeously color-graded monster-of-the-week show. It's the best thing on television since Buffy or Firefly or X-Files, and as much as I adore and respect those shows (I own them all and am glad of it), in my opinion Supernatural is better than any of them. The entire cast does a flawless job, the relationships are both achingly complicated and refreshingly simple, and the writers don't shy away from hard questions or harder answers. Loyalty to your family trumps everything, and you don't have to save the world every week, just the people you can.    I can't recommend it highly enough.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|why is it every single modern prog band is mired in horrible industry standard sound production?
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This CD continues to show the diversity that we have come to know and love about DT.  This is a marked departure from the storyline driven recordings and is a sonic assault with dark themes and hard-driving instrumentation.  Basically, take Train of Thought and turn up the intensity to 11...  The accompanying DVD does an great job of explaining what the band wanted for this album (concept, composition, lyrics, etc.) and allows the fan to experience how DT arrived at the final product. There is great studio footage of the boys being the \\"boys\\", and it continues to show that DT has four of the greatest musicians on their particular instruments as you will ever find.     In the many reviews that I have read both pre and post-purchase people try to pigeon-hole the genre of this album for reasons that escape me.  All I can say is, if you like rock, metal, prog-metal or any combination and variation thereof, you will not be disappointed in Systematic Chaos.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Maybe it's the rythm section as well, but Kenny adds another layer to these old blues guys. I would like to see a lot more of these types of CDs before we lose some of this great music. Since the recording and the release, 5 of the players had died. What a shame for the loss, but thanks Kenny and company for exposing them to a greater audience. They all deserved it.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|Although I'm not fluent in German, I still went to see this movie while it was in theaters (had to go to a little indie theater down the street). I wasn't very excited about seeing the movie, mostly because of the fact I didn't know much about German culture, but as the movie progressed the subtitles became less and less needed because the actors in the movie let their actions speak for them.  This movie is a definite see for anyone who enjoys a great plot and isn't afraid of reading what is happening every now and then.  All in all, a great film I wish more people had heard of!
B000PTYP7U|3.0|I'm actually a really big Paramore fan. And i absolutely loved All We Know Is Falling.. Riot on the otherhand i feel is not a big change up its just a little more slowpaced.    Its not that i dont like the cd, but everytime i hear a song from the Riot cd (Misery Business, Born For This and Fences) it reminds me of a better song on the AWKIF cd.. this irritates me a little bit and im a little disappointed that their style have changed so little.     Of course i think that a band should stick to whats working for them at most points and the guitar play is also very paramore recognisable.  but unfortunately i feel that this cd is just a slower and poorer version of All We Know Is Falling.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|Hooked from the first moment.  It's scary, suspenseful and funny.  You might learn something too...
B000P0J024|4.0|Unavailable for some time, the Travelling Wilburys in a must have addition to ones CD collection of essential music. The initial offering (CD # 1)is head and shoulders taller then the later issued CD # 2, which is absent the magic of its predecessor. The loss of Roy Orbison was perhaps a factor. The DVD is good, particularly showing the creative process that went into creating the initial offering. It is disappointing in that it only shows 2 live performances from the initial offering. However, worth the price
1932907009|5.0|First of all, I disagree with anyone who uses the IMDB approach, which pre-determines the quality of a book by how many classic movies the author has personally written.    It's funny how people who have produced nothing can so eagerly pronounce judgment on other people who are out there doing the work - whether it gets onscreen or not, or whether it wins any awards or not.    I don't need 'Blank Check' to be a masterpiece for me to decide whether I have anything to learn from a book by the same guy.    My advice to everyone who does, is to stop being so superior and open yourself up to learning something.    With the exception of David Mamet's \\"On Directing Film,\\" which was just as much about writing as directing, all the other books about screenwriting and storytelling that I know of, are written by people without big time movie credits, if they have any at all.  And while I wouldn't buy a book about investing money from someone who didn't invest any money himself, that rule doesn't apply here.    Chris Vogler, Michael Hauge, Billy Mernit, Rich Krevolin, Viki King, Syd Field, Robert McKee, John Truby, etc etc -- see any of these folks up there accepting Oscars?     I'm leaving William Goldman out of this because while his books are excellent, they're not specifically about process and method - but if you want to throw him in, then okay - with the exception of David Mamet and Wm Goldman, almost every other author of screenwriting books is not someone we're seeing in 'Variety' on a routine basis.    And yet, I have learned from all of them - at different times, and for different reasons, each one of these books has been just what the doctor ordered.   No, they're not really saying anything different, because the truth is there's not a whole lot different to say.   Stories work, when they work, for a reason.   Yet each author has a different approach to the same thing that is unique and refreshing and informative and - for me anyway - pretty darn useful.        Blake's approach in 'Save the Cat!' is clean and simple and very hard to argue with:  a whole lot of extremely popular movies tend to do the same things in the same places, and that's how they got so popular.   If you want to say that they only got popular because of the big name stars that were in them, I'll remind you that these same stars have their pick of everything - and they pick the scripts they do based on the strength of the storytelling, and how their character fits into it.   And the strength of any good storytelling, whether you like it or not - and most people don't, because it's about as sexy as roadkill - is structure.    What happens to a script after it's bought, all the way up through production (and even after - I've gotten phone calls from editing rooms to rewrite a scene), those are other stories.  Some have happy endings and some are horrific - but you will never get to tell those stories yourself until you figure out how to structure a movie script correctly, and then put your own voice to it.   And that's the order it has to be in - structure first, then voice.   I've read way too many scripts that had lots of passion and enthusiasm and all, but everything else was all over the place.  If you don't know where to put the stuff, no one's going to find it.    In the case of 'Save the Cat!' - I went back to a script that I had been having major and tremendously frustrating problems with.  The idea was there, scenes were there, great set pieces, lovely character moments - but still I just couldn't figure out how to crack it.   And then after reading the book and applying what was in there, I knew exactly what to do - and instead of floundering around for another 4 or 5 months, I will have this finished in about three weeks' time, which is great news to the people who are paying for it.   And if the right things happen and it gets made, and more right things happen and it's good, and even more right things happen and it's a hit (not all good movies arehits, just as not all hit movies are good, but I want mine to be both) -- then it will be because  'Save the Cat!' helped me get it back on track.    So if you want to judge things and make up reasons to put them down, go ahead.   But the real question should be, do you want to see your own movies made and be proud of them, badly enough to suspend your judgment and get a little humility (because believe me, you are going to need more humility than you can imagine, and if you don't bring it with you, it will be given to you and it never comes in a nice package) -- do you want it all badly enough to try anything, or just the things you're comfortable trying?    My philosophy is this:  if it works, I don't care where it came from.       If 'Save the Cat!' doesn't work for you, then get on here and say so, just like you should if it does.   Just like with any book.  I happen to think this one is great - Blake did his homework, he takes the job seriously and he makes his case enthusiastically and with amazing accuracy.   I'm sure you can still write a good movie without it - I just know that this book was a lifesaver for me - and that from here on in, it will always be very close at hand.
B000JK8OYU|3.0|I agree with the many others who are displeased that Amazon etc did not offer consumers listening samples of this album. I agree with those who feel that Sir George Martin and son should have taken it even further, wilder. I'd like to hear the Beatles FUNKED up! Bring in (sir) George Clinton on the next Beatles remix project!
0316018953|1.0|I don't suppose that Connelly owes me or any of the rest of us anything and The Overlook proves that he would agree. Whether this started as a magazine serial or a doodle, publishing it as part of the Bosch series suggests an interest in a payday and disrespect for those who have shelled out to escape into another adventure w/ Harry Bosch - adventures characterized by compelling plots but even more by Bosch's damaged but heroic psyche. It's not so much that it was short (like a chapter from the seminal Black Echo) but that it had no depth. Sir; you know what you did and I'm hoping you won't do it again. There's too many good writers out there to make room for one that no longer respects his audience.
B00000JS1M|5.0|I know that many people do not care too much of Saxon's the Power and the Glory, but I do.  This is one of my top fave releases by them.  The title track is a top notch masterpeace if you do not mind me saying. The guitar playing is exquisite.  Bif Byford's vocals are at his best.  Ok I may be getting a bit too melodramatic here.  But I do reccommend this cd, as well as most of there others.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The entire series is as good as any one part. Once you have seen a small portion you will have to see it all. You will not be disappointed.[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]
0380973464|5.0|I loved this book.  It's NOT for the lazy, hurry-to-the-end reader, though.  It's 918 pages or so, and that's a DENSE 918 pages of reading.     Don't be put-off by the \\"cyberpunk\\" tag that keeps getting connected to this book!  The world within the pages is gigantic and full of detail, and really can't be pigeonholed.    Read the excerpt provided by Amazon - you'll see that Cryptonomicon is not the overblown stereotype that you might picture cyberpunk to be.  The author's STYLE of writing is more pertinent than the genre.  If you like Stephenson's writing in the excerpt, then chances are you'll enjoy the whole book.    On a related note, if you find that the Bletchley Park / WW2 cryptography storyline is your favorite, you might also enjoy a book called \\"Enigma\\" by Robert Harris...I hate to be trite, but don't cheat and watch the film of Enigma - book's better!  [[ASIN:0804115486 Enigma]]
0761129235|5.0|I'm guilty of being a quitter.  I'm constantly setting goals...  goals that will \\"change my life\\" like creating a budget, excercising, eating healthy, and quitting smoking.  But more often than not, I give in when it actually comes down to taking the steps to reach these goals.       After reading this book, I've been able to break my goal into small, reachable steps - which after completing, motivate me to take the next step.  By using this simple but important practice, I've already seen myself accomplish \\"big\\" life transformation goals, which I've given up in the past.    This book is a quick read, but a very powerful lesson. I am so thankful I came across this book!
B000OLGCHA|4.0|This soundtrack is very refreshing.  It makes it's own way through the movie very smoothly.  A great departure from the John Williams (and similar sounding - to JW) soundtracks.  With an underlying reference to Hedwig's Theme the similarity stops there.  For me this is the best soundtrack outside of the Sorcerer's Stone.  Very impressive and very enjoyable.
B000002AZ8|5.0|Some things get better with time.  Vitalogy sounds better and more diverse as time goes by.  I own every PJ album & its hard to say which is \\"best\\" and which is \\"worst\\".  My favorite album and songs are always changing from a band of this talent.  Vitalogy is definelty one of thier finest achievements.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is one of The Beatles earlier albums.  It is filled with quirky love songs.  I love them all.  I'm a sucker for love songs.  Not one of their most experimental albums, but certainly good for what it is.  The Beatles have never put out a bad album.  BUY IT.  LOVE IT.
B000OQF6N6|2.0|Most bands that stand the test of time have to grow or at least change, or every album would sound the same.  I understand this & accept that the pumpkins of Gish thru Mellon Collie era no longer exist.  I haven't liked much since that era.  I just can't \\"get\\" their newer albums.  Hardcore PUMPKINS fans my disagree, but this album is flat, boring, and quite simply has no punch.  Classic SP almbums could hit as hard as any act in rock or slow it down, but with heavy emotion.  Maybe its the fact that this album is really only 1/2 of the orig. pumpkins... either way I would discourage fans of Gish, Lull, & S. Dream from buying this album.
B00005MM01|5.0|This album was introduced to me at 14 years old (I am 27).  I feel like its melodies and lyrics actually helped to shape who I am. The songs on this album range from meaningful and delicate to quirky and hopping.  Each song deserves equal credit for making this one of my all time favorite albums.  A smile on your face, a tear in your eye, Donovan can bring out the feeling.  A MUST HAVE!

0486650677|5.0|I've read this gem and done most of the evercises in about 3 months. Before that legendary book I'd had the usual crappy course in Classical Mechanics based on Goldstein. The bottom line is the book will show you a lot of advanced material and unfamiliar manipulations. On the other hand there are sometimes statements lacking proof or more detailed lucid explanation. The book is appropriate for readers that already know what action is, totall beginners will be too shocked by the new concepts and won't be able to pick up the important nuances revealed by Lanczos.    Lanczos work clarified some of the concepts in which my CM course failed:   - the important difference in treating holonomic and nonholonomic constraints  - exact constraints are mathematical idealization of infinitely rigid constraint forces  - Lagrange multipliers for functionals (actions) not only functions  - the logical thread virtual work -> d'Alembert -> Hamilton's principle  - the connection between the action in configuration space and  in phase space     The book introduced me to topics not covered by the course, which was my initial goal:  - elimination of ignorable variables in L or H formulation  - canonical transformations, definition and importance  - generating function of canonical transformation  - test for canonicity of transformation using Poisson brackets  - integral invariants of canonical transformations  - Hamilton's principal function   - Hamilton-Jackobi equation and analogy with optical wave surfaces  - separation of variables in H-J equation  - action-angle variables for separable periodic systems  - evolution of the system as a sequence of canonical transformation  - introducing geometry and geodesics in phase space    The reading definitely increased my freedom in manipulating the variational problem into equivalent variational problem. Examples of the two most weird for me manipulations are in the appendices. In the first appendix the Hamiltonian formulation is derived from the Lagrangian by introducing new variables, constraints and corresponding Lagrange multipliers, and then eliminating the variables. In appendix II, the most popular cases of Noether's theorem are derived by introducing new field variables in the action - I had no idea that was allowed. Very interesting was the idea that the world line of the system in configuration space can be parametrized with arbitrary parameter and the time becomes a function of that parameter that is varied together with the other generalized coordinates. Such variation is normal for GR but I've never seen it done in non-relativistic mechanics. EDIT: Sept 2008. Recently I've found a textbook that clearly explains some of the fuzzy examples in Lanczos like varying the time: \\"Analytical Mechanics for Relativity and Quantum Mechanics\\" by Oliver Johns.    Some of the other reviews described the book as 'lucid'. I find that eggagerated - although the book shows lots of unfamiliar manipulations, sometimes proofs of validity or the necessary more detailed conceptual or calculational explanations are lacking. An example is the inclusion, all of a sudden, of the time as variable to be varied - where is the proof one is allowed to do that? In another case, the book tells you that by nullifying the boundary term when varying the action, one gets 'natural' boundary conditions for the Euler-Lagrange diff. equations. I failed to see how the physics of the problem would demand exactly those boundary conditions. Where the analogy between mechanics and optics was discussed, the book creates the impression it derived the Fermat's principle but in reality it simply proved that the path following the gradient of of constant surfaces is shortest between two points. So there is a certain gegree of fuzziness on calculational level (lacking proofs of validity) or conceptual level (underexplained concepts and relations).     I liked the the abundance of historical notes. You will learn that there are several formulations of the least action principle - Euler and Lagrange version, Jackobi version and Hamilton version. Each subsection has a small summary and there are a few problems per section to illustrate the main ideas but not enough for exercises.     There are two chapters that I think appeared in later editions and are too sketchy compared to the book core:     Chapter 9 discusses special relativity where you can see that guessing the relativistic Lagrangian on general grounds of Lorentz invariance gives almost effortlessly the relativistic dynamics without the usual gedanken experiments. At the end, Lanczos dives a little into GR using the Schwartzchild metric to derive orbits, bending of light rays and gravitational redshift around spherical body.    Chapter 11 gives a short presentation of fluid mechanics (a little unclear derivation, in Lagrange and Euler coordinates), elasticity, and electromagnetism. Noether's principle is used to derive the canonical and the symmetric energy momentum tensor. I haven't seen a crystal clear derivation of Noether anywhere and Lancsoz is not an exception. The problem is as usual ommiting what exactly is being transformed and why is that allowed.
0452282152|5.0|This book is absolutely gorgeous. Chevalier paints with words as Vermeer painted with paint. Her prose and descriptions actually take on the same quality as Vermeer's paintings, luminous, quiet, and very strikingly beautiful. The character Griet is complex and interesting. The descriptions in this book are breath taking. Read this!!! Oh, and I am a teenager. Teenagers will love it too.
B000001GXB|4.0|There is no such thing as the 'Greatest' Beethoven recording(s), just as there is no 'Definative' performance or 'The Greatest meal I ever had'.    Pollini's Beethoven is very interesting.  His Hammerklavier is clean, to the point, and I like it.  But I don't think it's Great' nor do I prefer it to many others.  To do so would mean that Beethoven's piano sonatas are not very profound and it's easy for one person to 'nail' them.  They're not.  What makes them 'Great' is that like Life itself, there are many ways of looking at them, feeling them, hearing them.    BTW These recordings are over 30 years old.  I heard Pollini a couple of months ago at Carnegie Hall play the Hammerklavier.  Now, in his old age, he just bangs it out as quickly as possible.
B000EOTAM6|2.0|I suppose my expectations were too high after having seen the cartoon long ago and holding it in fond memory.<br /><br />Dialogue is insufferably hackneyed in this film.<br /><br />The characters betray their initial and original anti-hero nature long before the major plot cop-outs that render morally questionable characters into cardboard heroes.<br /><br />Get the cartoon anthology instead; this movie is not worth buying and only worth renting as part of a double-bill or multi-title sitting.<br /><br />Even great special effects left me yawning at insipid characters played by actors too important in the Hollywood food chain to be allowed unsympathetic roles or dialogue with words & memes they're too dim to express with conviction of understanding.<br /><br />And, as all too usual in Hollywood, when the pace falters, it's time to show off automatic weapons. I never knew machine guns could be so boring.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|I love live music and I love John Mayer.  That is what made this album a good buy for me.  If you are looking for Johns classics then this album might not be for you because it features stuff from a trio of his.  It does have a great Somethings Missing and some songs that are Newer in this album from the newest album.      All and all if you are looking for some different John Mayer stuff and you already like him this would be a great addition to your collection.    This album has a blusey feel to it much like his latest album has.
B00005JPHT|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. SiCKO is mostly about the American Health care system, however the greater theme is our GREED. I hate those who critizise Michael Moore for wanting us to have a better society. He does these movie for his love for America because he wants to make us a better country. Why cannot we learn from other countries and fix ourselves. We need to get out of our isolated world and look at what is happening around us. What works for them will most likely also work for us. Lets give it a chance. Lets live in a world without fear.
0060920084|5.0|I loved this book.  Part of the reason why I loved this book is because I drive in my car every year out west from Buffalo, NY.  I also have taken many car trips in the eastern part of the country.  When I go on these driving trips I do it because I am reaching a destination to do some hiking and or climbing.      I thought the idea of this book was great of Mr. Bryson trying to find the perfect town in small town America.  The humor that Mr. Bryson has is terrific.  In the end Mr. Bryson has a greater appreciation for the area of the country, which he originally comes from after exploring much of the country in his vehicle.      I thought this book was very funny because it makes humor out of many American types of things.  It also is a good representation of what life is like on the road.  Part of the reason why I enjoyed this book so much was because I have traveled a lot of this country by car and seen many small towns.  This book does offer so many interesting pieces of information throughout it.  I would recommend this book to anyone that has traveled the road and seen many small towns in America.  I would also recommend this book to anyone that appreciates Mr. Bryson's humor.
B00003CX95|5.0|Not going to go on and on about how great the movie is.....over 800 reviews and a 5 star rating already tells us this.  All I want to add is what I thought the best part of this DVD was.  The running commentary by Mel Gibson while the movie is being shown in sub titles and speech ( muted some while Gibson is speaking) is a stroke of genius !  I learned so much about how scenes were shot, how long it took to shoot a scene, insiders secrets, what parts of the movie Gibson liked the best  ( and not so much) and why.  I watch the movie at least once a week..... I am bedridden.....and episodic TV gets old very fast.  The only way I watch it now is with the commentary.  And for us women, while Wallace looks great in a kilt, Robert The Bruce looks great period.

0385340559|3.0|I was disappointed by the characters who seemed incredibly stupid for a hot-shot investigative team.  Why go shopping for a Hendrix album when 2 minutes on the Internet would answer the question?  Since one of the team is supposedly technically astute, I was stunned that they would waste time shopping.  Later, another key item could have easily been researched on the Web first.  I guessed the password before their first try.  These things, plus many others, made me wonder how this team ever solved a case \\"back in the day.\\"<br /><br />This feels like an early attempt that Child pulled off the shelf and dusted off to satisfy his publisher's demand for a new Reacher.  I hope Child takes some time off and gets back in touch with his character. I miss the Jack Reacher of earlier novels.
B000PY52EU|4.0|saw this film a few weeks back and i was truly getting into it. Samuel L. Jackson playing a Blues Guitarist who reads his bible encounters a straight up freak in Ricci. that whole scene when Christina Ricci is tripping on the floor and Sam Jackson runs outside with his bible had me rolling in my crib. I was like that is a Churrch Moment Right Thurr. the film was creative but you could tell the director behind \\"Hustle anf flow\\" was on board here. very entertaining and kept me on the edge of my seat. Justin Timberlake did a decent job.Christina Ricci did a good job, she needs to eat a bit more,but she was cool in the role. this film was a trip.
1400063515|5.0|While Taleb's style may be polemic, I believe that there can't be enough said about randomness, chaos, and complexity theory in relation to business planning. I looked beyond the jabs at the French, and other stylistic annoyances to find a solidly well thought out indictment of the way the predictive sciences are used in business. I would highly recommend Eric Beinhocker's \\"Origin of Wealth\\" to anyone who found this topic remotely interesting. The \\"Origin of Wealth\\" does not leave the business reader is as hopeless a state as \\"The Black Swan,\\" while getting across a very similar message.
B000P0J024|5.0|The combined talents of Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne, George Harrison, Tom Petty and Bob Dylan, all superstars in there own right, overflow in this superb collection. Even a not so big Dylan fan like me loved the way these superbly talented musicians, blended and complimented each other to create some wonderful music for every fan to enjoy.   It keeps alive the memory of the immense talent of Orbison and Harrison and is a must for the CD collection
B00005JMEW|5.0|Powerful films are hard to come by these days.  But when Quentin Tarantino is directing something, you know it's special.  Kill Bill is a revenge movie, done in a grindhouse kind of style.  It's Tarantino's first action film, but don't worry, his dialogue is as cool as ever.  Featuring neat music, humorous scenes, and silly unrealistic violence, Kill Bill is a fun experience.  I hope you enjoy it!

B000F6IOC0|3.0|Underworld Evolution continues where the last movie ended, with Marcus awakening.  It turns out he wishes to release his brother, William, the first of the lycans.  The movie traces the start of the war between the vampires and werewolves.  But, outside of the wild Williams, we don't have any lycan characters.  Also, the fact that Selene was betrayed by her own kind should not be a shock - we became aware of that in the last film.  And how is killing the immortal bothers part of her revenge?  As you can guess I am somewhat disappointed with the second movie and while I love Kate Beckinsale as an actor and as a vampire, that wasn't enough to save this film.  Lots of star power and a good mixture of special effects but the story was just too badly made to hold up.  In other words, no story, lots of action.  Get the popcorn and turn off the mind.
B000M4RG42|5.0|In this epic film about the Battle of Iwo Jima, director Clint Eastwood triangulates three different viewpoints about the war. First are the soldiers themselves, normal human beings who resist the notion of being labeled \\"heroes\\" and who, in contrast to war sloganeers, know what combat means. These men are bravery and loyalty personified. Then, there is the vantage point of real war in all its vulgarity, degradation, terror, violence, and dehumanization. 70,000 Americans stormed the island and some 6,8000 died. 22,000 Japanese defended their land and 20,000 of them died. Finally, there is the government propaganda machine back home that must manipulate public opinion to send its sons into that meat grinder. Almost every American will recognize the iconic photograph of the six soldiers raising the flag on top of the tiny island of Iwo Jima (by Joe Rosenthal). But very few Americans know the reality behind the image. Eastwood shows how the government manipulated the image, distorted the historical facts, exploited the unwitting soldiers who raised the flag (forced fund raising tours back home), and turned a mundane moment of wartime into a propagandistic farce. The film is based upon the book by James Bradley and Ron Powers, which tells the real story about the flag-raising (Bradley's father was the last survivor of the six soldiers). Eastwood's sequel, Letters from Iwo Jima, tells the story of this battle from the viewpoint of the Japanese.

0743289684|5.0|I think I can safely say I understand what the statement \\"Speaking Truth to Power\\" means now, after having read Ms. Ali's stunning memoir.  Ultimately, religious oppression can be reduced to misogyny, or hatred/fear of women, especially it would seem within the Muslim religion where a man's inability to control his impulses is forgiven while the woman who becomes his victim is punished.  It must then seem doubly unfair to Ms. Ali that women, carrying out the edicts of men, are so often the perpetrators of violence in Ms. Ali's childhood.  The ritualistic and vividly-described excision of her genitals, the ruthless beatings and blind obedience are passed down through the women in the family.  Ms. Ali rightly points out how this type of misogyny and violence is sanctioned by and at the base of her religion.  However, Ms. Ali is stronger than all that.  She see the hypocrisy for what it is, boldly dares to question it, refuses to accept the answers she receives, and decides bravely to receive these answers elsewhere.<br /><br />I was extremely impressed by the use of language in this book.  The tone is perfect.  Her slight detachment from the subject matter necessary, yet we always feel that we are living through it with her.  She takes the mundane and turns it into pure poetry.  However, there is a warning at the core of this book.  We would be foolish to disregard it.<br /><br />Bravo!
075640407X|5.0|I think that overall this was a wonderfully written book, it kept me up all night unable to put it back down. From beginning to end it was suspenseful and entertaining. I feel like I can really relate to all the characters in the book and it helps you understand things from each characters point of view.
B000OLGCHA|4.0|There is always a sense of foreboding when one learns that a new film score composer has been assigned to an established series where we have already become accustomed to themes and motifs that have illuminated beloved characters and places.  Indeed, that music becomes as endearing if not necessary as the actors, the characters, and settings themselves.  Thus when it became known that John Williams would not continue to score the Harry Potter series we raised an eyebrow with Patrick Doyle when he took on \\"The Goblet of Fire,\\" but all proved well enough.  When it was announced that yet another, and a less known, composer had been signed to score \\"The Order of the Phoenix\\" some nervousness had to be expected.  Indeed, this writer put off picking up the soundtrack until after the film had been released and happily viewed.  We are most happy to sigh in great relief that once again Harry Potter is in capable musical hands.  Welcome to Hogwarts Nicholas Hooper.  Of course there is the inclusion of Williams' \\"Hedwig's Theme,\\" but from that onward this score belongs to Hooper and it is delightful on both the screen and the soundtrack recording.  Hooper has ably given new musical wonder and delight to Hogwarts while also serving up a necessary musical sense of dread as the story drifts into darkness.  But Hooper always seems cognizant that above all this music must remind us of the wide-eyed wonder that is Harry Potter's world even though the music also reminds us that there are dark and troubling times ahead.  One might take some issue with the order of the musical cuts on this album, but Hooper knew what he was doing for it all comes together.  The decision to open with music from a great scene well into the film, \\"Fireworks,\\" is backed up by the immediate realization that this piece works wonderfully well as something of an opening overture:  hold on, this is where we are going!  His theme for Professor Umbridge captures all of her moods from almost comedic to downrightsinister.  And there is an abundance of momentary musical gems throughout (note especially the brief but wonderful \\"Flight of the Order of the Phoenix\\").  Indeed, welcome to Hogwarts Mr. Hooper, and we hope you stay around for the remaining films.  Ably produced and packaged by Warner Bros.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I didn't really expect much from this movie but was greatly surprised. I did feel the Jane Austen vibe and think she probably would have enjoyed to watch it herself. The Colin Firth version of this book is just as good, only different. Like people have said, this movie does have a more modern twist to the classic Austen novel. But I don't think that the movie is bad, actually, I think it was done very well.    The little artistic screen shots presented throughout the entire movie made it appear less \\"finished\\" and glossed-over, as in most mainstream movies. The scenery was beautiful and I would LOVE to visit everywhere that was shown.    The characters were wonderful and I loved how they actually appeared to be family. Mr. Darcy's character was just as I had pictured him from the novel and although some say the movie caused him to appear pathetically shy, I wonder if Austen had not intended him to be so in her novel? Someone shy can also still have pride, maybe even more so. His pride against the happiness that still came with the inferiority of Lizzie and her family's life? Or pride against having someone not grovel and actually intellectually argue with him? Or whatever...    I have watched this movie several times and plan to watch it again. Every time, I find something new that I had not heard nor seen before. Don't expect a movie straight from the novel, but expect a movie that respectably modernizes one of the best books ever.

0060558121|4.0|Very readable. Gaiman has a style the reminds me most of Clive Barker, especially in the end.<br /><br />The plot and story are good. Although Gaiman could have come up with a better name for his hero. There are too many great names in the book for the lead to named shadow. I never quite got overt that while reading the book. Bugged me each time I read his name.<br /><br />The best part of the book though is the idea. The idea of gods in America, how they come to be here. How new gods are born and die. Their very human natures. It was good to think about these things as the story unfolded.
1591841666|5.0|This is a very quick read, a set of simple concepts, yet articulated in a way that solidifies a lot of things you've always sensed or felt.  It really makes you think!  I read it last night and have been thinking constantly about it all day-- seeing how many experiences in life have fit into this model and how it all makes sense.    This book will stick with me for a very long time and I am sure will become part of my normal language and thinking about decision-making in my life.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This record has all the number one hits in the history of the Beatles, what you can add to that.
B000002JNJ|5.0|Cowboys From Hell (1990.), Pantera's first recognised studio album (their fifth if you count their four album releases during the 1980's which the band now totally disregards)<br /><br />At the turn of the 90's nobody would have expected Pantera to become one of the greatest metal bands of the decade and in fact of all time. The band had released four inconspicuous glam metal styled releases in the previous decade which brought them very little success. However, being remembered as a little known glam act was not to be Pantera's fate. At the end of the 80's the band were able to complete a drastic stylistic change to their sound, making themselves much more heavy and brutal. After then being turned down by numerous record companies, Pantera were finally signed to Atco Records (a division of Atlantic) and were able to release the beast that was `Cowboys From Hell'...<br /><br />`Cowboys From Hell' is the start of a new era as far as metal is concerned. By altering their sound, Pantera all but created a new metal genre which we now come to know as groove metal or post-thrash. With `Cowboys From Hell', Pantera took the choppy and gallopy ryhthms of bands such as Metallica and Megadeth but added a great deal more heaviness, emphasis and groove to the mix. This coupled with the high pitched wails and screams of vocalist Phil Anselmo gave Pantera very brutal and uncompromising sound. This album was one of the heaviest things around at the time of it's release. `Cowboys From Hell' is a seminal metal classic in every sense of the word. The songwriting throughout the album is superb and I wouldn't say there was a single weak track on the whole work. I wouldn't say that this was Pantera's definitive, most genre defining work - that honour goes to the follow-up `Vulgar Display Of Power' - however, this for me is my favourite Pantera album. In terms of songwriting strength, I think this album wins out over all of the subsequent Pantera albums. Also, in my opinion, Dimebag Darrell, the legend himself gives his best display of guitar work on this album. Even though his guitar sound is a little more high pitched and shrill than on the later albums, he plays a fantastic array of inspired riffs, crips fills and majestic solos. In short he shows off his guitar work on this album more than any other and it is awesome to listen to. `Cowboys From Hell' is a little more thrashy than later releases, where the bands groove metal style would become more prominent. Vocalist Phil Anselmo also sings in a less aggressive style than on later album, however he does a fantastic job throughout the album. Vinnie Paul's drumming has its trademark stamp of impressive double bass and general aggression throughout the album. Rex, on bass, for me does a great job. Often the most overlooked member of the band, playing bass in a one guitar metal band is a lot harder than a band with two and he gives a great undercurrent to Dime's riffing.<br /><br />This metal masterpiece gets underway with the title track `Cowboys From Hell'. This is definitive Pantera, heck it's a definitive metal classic!  Dime's immortal riffs impress from the word go and this high energy opener makes for obligatory moshing every time its played. `Primal Concrete Sledge' is a short follow-up. Fast, low pitched, growling guitar work from Dime is supplemented by an unstoppable barrage of double bass from Vinnie. Phil Anselmo mixes up vocal styles very well in this song. `Psycho Holiday' is another classic off this album, the riffs are great and effortless and Anselmo's vocals scream through the speakers with intent. Dime fires out an inspired solo mid-way through. `Heresy' is another awesome song, this was one of the first Pantera songs that I ever heard. It is very gallopy and thrashy in style, especially with the main riff. There is yet another fantastic solo from Dime mid-way through. `Cemetery Gates' is the epic of the album, clocking in at over 7 minutes. A clean undistorted opening allows Anselmo to give a more understated vocal performance. This song, about the death of a lover has some more great riffs and solos. It also has an edge to it that shows of the band's glam past, however it is one of the best tracks on the album. `Domination' is an unstoppable juggernaut of a song, displaying Pantera's pioneering style brilliantly - espicially powerful is the outro with pounding chords and some high tapped guitar lines from Dime.<br /><br />Next up is `Shattered'. A shorter song, it is another good thrashy tune with plenty of aggression and strong vocals. `Clash With Reality' is one of the more underrated tracks from the album and combines plenty of heavy, racing riffs with a cool melody. `Medicine Man' is much more darker in vocal and musical style. A stripped down verse led by the bass gives way to a gripping chorus with more high pitched vocal wails. `Message In Blood' is more signature Pantera with a heavy bonecrunching feel. `The Sleep' combines a more acoustic and cleaner sound to Pantera's music. The song's chorus is especially impressive and memorable. Then we finish with `The Art Of Shredding', which is for me another great showcase for Dimebag. He `really' does show us the art of shredding on this brilliant finale to one of the all time great metal albums!<br /><br />So there we have it, an album of uncompromising heaviness and immense songwriting. Pantera never looked back from changing their sound and `Cowboys From Hell' was the start of a series of awesome releases from the band throughout the 1990's. This album is for me though their finest effort, a classic from start to finish. The album is well produced and each band member sounds great. Pantera defined a new aspect to the metal genre as well as a new generation of metal fans and deserve their lofty position in the minds of many. If you're looking to start listening to Pantera, I would recommend this album and the follow-up `Vulgar Display Of Power' as the place to start. I guarantee new listeners to this album will be hooked instantly, just like I was when I first bought it. An album not to be missed!<br /><br />R.I.P. Dimebag Darrel<br /><br />MY RATING: 10/10rstated vocal performance. This song, about the death of a lover has some more great riffs and solos.

0385522401|5.0|I found this one of McEwan's most powerful and moving books to date. In On Chesil Beach, McEwan has brought together a man and a woman, who meet, court, love each other, and yet one of them is moving toward their marital night with anticipation and the other with dread.  Their love seems real and their disparate feelings about the consummation for me was quite genuine. The marital night is a disaster and their ineptitude forever fractures their relationship. I felt the character development was skillful and nuanced.  The sense of loss created by one irreparable moment is overwhelming and palpable. Although seemingly not much takes place in the novel, what does take place has broad ramifications.  We get a window on what the characters are thinking and feel the impact of small gestures and events.  Many events in the past are alluded to.   For me this was powerful, brilliant and very moving and extremely well written.

B000MZHW40|5.0|Sure I've seen the T-shirts Bling is Dead and saw a music video or two on the matter (And yes... I did purchase the movie because I think Djimon Hounsou is hot )but I can't say that the blood diamond trade ever penetrated my bling-blinders until this movie. The movie was very very good. Great even - although something doesn't taste right about saying a movie this disturbing, bloody and brutal was great. I very highly recommend this intense action movie. I don't think I will ever be able to look at those lifeless, shiny, cold rocks the same way again.
1416523359|3.0|Ok, let me just say that I am not a Stephen King fan.  Clowns jumping up out of the sewer and cars that come to life just don't do it for me, but I thought I would give this rather large (500 pages in Hardcover) book a try.  This book was rather interesting....King isn't known for his romance writing abilities, but he did a fair job here.  One of the things I didnt care for were the pet words that the couple created to communicate between themselves, as well as references to bad-gunkys and blood bools.  What is that all about?  I really could not even get interested into the book until I was half way through, and most people won't trudge through 250 pages to \\"get to the good part\\". The thing is, though, once you got half way through it, it actually a fair book.  There where times though when I would think \\"what the smuck is that all about?\\"... All in all though, it was a fair book, but not one I would recommend unless you have a lot of time on your hands. If you are a King fan, you will probably like this (althought I have been told it is rather strange, even for King, and not his best).  If you aren't a King fan, don't start with this book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First of all I like Star Wars and Star Trek, but I like this series as well.  I don't watch much TV and I was too young to watch Firefly when it was originally aired.  I have recently discovered it by watching the movie and then buying the boxed set. I think that this series is more interesting than the other shows currently on TV.  This show is not the perfect view of the future as in Star Trek where everybody gets along (for the most part).  It is about a group of people trying to live their lives how they want to.  The western part of it is interesting and reasonable if you know the background, the government gives settlers of new worlds the barest necessities to survive; so it is not a crude mix of sci-fi and western.  Even in our world today there are some technologically advanced societies as well as some developing nations.  Our technological  infrastructure is precarious and it does not take much imagination to conceive a world where it failed.    - C.Daunt

Some of my favorites from the concert include: Live to Tell, Jump, Like a Virgin, Ray of Light, I Love New York, Let it Will Be, and La Isla Bonita. Madonna never disappoints, she always delivers a strong show no matter if she's performing new songs or classics. My favorite theme is probably the equestrian act. This item also comes with a bonus CD. I highly recommend checking The Confessions Tour out. It's  worth the money. Enjoy!

The clear and concise narration help us to have a deeper understanding of the Mother Nature. Moreover, it also improves ones' geographical knowledge.   I really enjoy this DVD and have watched it a few times in the short period of time since I purchased it. Dairies at the end of each episode gives the insight on the difficulties in filming.  Many thanks to the brave and patient crews who risk and sacrificed their lives to produce this magnificent documentary.

032147404X|5.0|This compact book is a gem of a find. It would be advantageous for the novice as well as a seasoned photographer. Scott Kelby is knowledgable and has a great sense of humor that makes what normally is boring stuff really fun to read. This book is chock full of excellent, no nonsense, highly applicable information. I find myself going back to it time and again. Mr. Kelby has included not only technical photographic instructions, but includes websites and other sources that are helpful.  He includes his own monthly web cast information that to me, has more than paid for the book. I have recently purchased his new \\"Lighroom\\" book and find it is excellent as well.
1591840562|4.0|Guy Kawasaki is often criticized in the blogsphere for not being eligible to write books like this one on the grounds of never really starting a company of his own. I am not going to argue that, simply because it does not matter.    First of all, there is no \\"silver bullet\\" or a \\"secret formula\\" to start a successful company and it would be stupid to expect this book to be one. Secondly, on a practical note, \\"The Art of the Start\\" is filled with very pragmatic advice, often coming not from Guy himself but rather his friends, venture capitalists, angel investors and/or successful founders and generally everything makes a lot of sense.    Most likely, the book will NOT be something of a revelation for you, but it should re-assure you about this you're right about, and possibly will tell you something new and helpful. Besides, it is really tiny. Get it on a train/plain with you and be done with it.

B000068TPN|3.0|I usually like Mel Gibson films especially \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" \\"Braveheart,\\" the series of \\"Leathal Weapon\\" and \\"Mad Max.\\" As a war film however, this film had a lot of defects. Obviously, this was not filmed in Southeast Asia. I know because I used to live there. The folliage and plants give away the location. They should have at least filmed it in the Hawaii Islands like in the case of \\"Tears of the Sun.\\" This film is not even in my top 10 list of best war films, maybe in my top 30 if I stretch.
B000J103PC|1.0|I caught the middle of this movie and frankly never went back to see the beginning. Ah, where to begin......!    First of all Meryl Streep-Hack pretty much phoned in this performance, very LOWWWWWWW voice and spoke SLOOOOOWWWWLLLYYYYY. Not much different than any other part she's played and let's get honest here: Meryl Streep-Hack has been a hack in every movie since \\"Sophie's Choice.\\" She never changes character. This character was pretty much a rip-off of what she played in \\"Death Becomes Her.\\" OK? And the wig! Sorry Meryl, you're not yet 60 and you looked 70!    Anne Hathaway: Loved her in \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" and I'd never seen her before. She handled a difficult role very well. Nothing for her to do in Devil but look surprised, got tired of the big brown vacant eyes and big red lips.  She kinda looks like she just wandered onto the set and wasn't sure what to do. Stan Tucci DID steal the movie. He was refreshingly a believable character with a lot of life to him.    The plot is a one-note samba of sending a green employee out on impossible errands. ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzz....... If you REALLY want to see a great movie about a sadistic boss, rent Swimming with Sharks. Kevin Spacey will never be duplicated as the movie producer who could reach in and rip out your GUTS with ego crushing words or just a LOOK!! Meryl could take acting lessons from him. And should!     Devil is a movie you know where it's going, Sharks left you guessing.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I have read Jane Eyre numerous times over the years, and own both the Ciaran Hinds and the Timothy Dalton film version, as well as having seen the William Hurt version.  This is absolutely my favorite film adaptation.  Although there are some deviations from the novel, the performances/casting/scenery truly reflect the tone of the novel as well as the Romantic/Gothic setting in which it takes place.  Ruth Wilson and Toby Stevens manage to convey the passion and emotion that the former movies lacked almost entirely.  Truly Well Done!
B00005JNDZ|3.0|Rene Zellweger packed on the pounds once again to play Bridget Jones in the sequel to her successful run in the first movie.  WHile three years passed in real life until the second movie was made, it has only been a few weeks since Bridget found her happiness with Mark Darcy.  She is happy as can be, with her winner of a boyfriend, and enjoying an all around happy streak in life.  Soon, however, she is on shakey ground.      She fears that Mark is turning his affections towards the new hot number in his law firm.  Her paranoia is rising, as she sees the other woman's bright smiles and her appearences at every outing she and Mark go on.  Out of the blue, Daniel Cleaver, the cad who played her, reappears in her newly aquired field of television reporting.  Convinced that Mark is cheating, Bridget goes on an ill advised and irrational trip to Thailand with Daniel Cleaver for business which will inevitably turn into pleasure.    It wasn't as good as the first one, as there were no big surprises.  Daniel will inevitably cheat on her and be caught like in the first one.  Bridget will end up in some terrible mess again (getting thrown in the Thai jail - and notice how all the cellmates speak English marginally well?).  And Mark will come to her rescue once more and bail her out.  Still, it was a good time, with Bridget's bumbling antics.  SHe can laugh at herself, as we can all laugh at ourselves.  And if you can't laugh at yourself, than you're even stupider than others think we are.
1400064627|4.0|Whenever I see a movie that was originally a book, I always want to read the book. Then i got on amazon and saw how many people were just lovin the book! So i got. And here I am, to make my own rave review.<br />Although the book jumps around alot, somehow I never got confused or annoyed. It just still fit seamlessly together, ninny telling her story and the rest being filled in. And then it tells the story of Evelyn, who's struggling with depression and her want to die. And then it goes through with her as she suddenly becomes angry, calling herself Towanda.<br />I'd say that it's definately worth the money.
B000003NA4|5.0|Just love her voice...Great songs, great musicians.  Love everyone of her CD's, this one is my reference CD for listening to Speakers...  Track 10 is one of the best upright bass track I have ever heard.  My favorite engineer, Al Schmitt. What else can I say...

B000002B7O|5.0|ozzy's career kept right on after sabbath gave him the boot.  this is his second record after going solo and its his best.  sadly this is the last album featuring guitar great randy rhoads.  best songs over the mountain, flying high again, believer, little dolls, tonight and diary of a madman.  6 of the 8 songs are greats.  if you buy this MAKE SURE you buy the version with the small picture on the front cover b/c the entire ozzy catalog was remastered and randy's guitar work was left out and re-recorded by other artists which is a disgrace.  pick up blizzard of ozz too.
B000002KB8|4.0|From the very beginning, Black Sabbath were loud, dark, powerful, and heavy as hell. Released in 1970, their self-titled debut is, for all practical purposes, the first true heavy metal album, combining the hard rockin' sounds of groups like Cream, Vanilla Fudge, and Blue Cheer with Ozzy Osbourne's demonic moan to form one eardrum-shredding package. Tony Iommi's corrosive guitar riffs form the heart of the band's sound, fusing hot-wired blues with sludgy rock 'n' roll and weird alternate tunings to form a doom-laden musical atmosphere. Terrence \\"Geezer\\" Butler's chugging bass playing and Bill Ward's lopsided, storming drums seal the deal, and the result is an absolute monster of a rock act.    As a statement of purpose, this album hits the nail on the head. The title track features a spine-crushing riff and a dense, murky rhythm, all of which underpins Ozzy's dark, apocalyptic vocal performance. \\"The Wizard\\" is lighter on its feet, but the tune still packs a heck of a punch: It's a rollicking blues-rocker with a great harmonica solo and some flailing rhythms. \\"A Bit of Finger/ Sleeping Village/ Warning\\" is a gigantic chunk of smoldering blues-metal, with a stomach-churning bass line and some of Osbourne's most deliciously paranoid lyrics. The other extended medley, \\"Wasp/ Behind The Wall Of Slip/ Bassically/ N.I.B.\\" is a brutal showcase of the band's sound at its most extreme. The track boasts some violently distorted guitars, stomping rhythms, and lyrics that sow the seeds for heavy metal's fascination with Satanism and the occult. The \\"N.I.B.\\" section is particularly nasty, thanks to its strutting, Zeppelin-esque guitar riff.    Still, the album isn't exactly perfect. \\"Wicked World\\" is particularly weak- it's a boring, repetative number with some really lame guitars (except for the somewhat jazzy intro) and Ozzy trying a bit too hard to be socially concious. Iommi's soling during \\"Warning\\" overstays its welcome by about four minutes, as the guitarist noodles around aimlessly without actually building towards anything.    Still, those are small complaints- Black Sabbath's debut is a really freaking good rock album, and an important part of any complete heavy metal collection. Crank it, baby!

B000002JQ6|5.0|if you want to know what a band really sounds like then buy a live cut and find out as they are unpolished by the studio.  these tracks sound just as good or better than their studio albums.  in fact, this is my fav ac/dc album.  most of the greats are here, no filler just in your face rock.  a superb record from one of the greats rock bands of all time.
B000002KON|5.0|While 1968's Village Green Preservation Society hearkened back to an idylic England of the past, its follow-up is a scathing look at the vagaries of life in modern Britian. This is a dark, satirical, bitter, and often tragic album, full of biting sarcasm and genuine pathos. It's a song-cycle that portrays (what Ray Davies percieves as) the fading greatness of Britain through the eyes of its title character, an aging everyman who traded in his dreams for a life of middle class mediocrity. Bear in mind, this isn't what you'd call a rock opera- the album doesn't tell a story, per se, but simply presents a series of snapshots of a man's life. Each song is a little vignette, a study of one aspect of modern life.     The album is, as a whole, one of the strongest batches of songs recorded by the Kinks. Davies' songwriting is razor-sharp, an endless string of keen insights and evocative moments. The music itself is a spot-on mixture of lean classic rock and diverse elements ranging from music hall to folk. \\"Brianwashed\\" is a stinging, cynical hard-rocker with a meaty guitar riff, and \\"Young And Innocent Days\\" is a darkly wistful accoustic track with a wonderfully lilting melody. \\"Some Mother's Son\\" and \\"Yes Sir No Sir\\" are both startlingly good anti-war songs- the former is a nightmarish, haunting ballad, while the latter is a stomping, snarling shape shifter. \\"Drivin'\\" matches an ironically cheerful melody with lyrics that ruthlessly mock the willful ignorance and cowardice of the middle class. \\"Australia\\" is a dazzling, dremay epic, while \\"Victoria\\" is a rousing, rocking, and bitingly sarcastic tribute to England's \\"glory days.\\" \\"Shangrli-La\\" is the album's centerpiece: A dark, moody masterpiece, the song displays Arthur simulataneously at his most pathetic and his most human. Musically, it's a complex, multifaceted piece that's built around some beautiful guitars and a few torrents of melody. Basically, it's a masterpiece.    But then again, so is the whole album. One of the finest albums of the entire 60s, and a shining highlight of the Kinks' career, Arthur is a classic that belongs in the posession of every single fan of rock music.
B00005NTN5|5.0|An ex-con (Gina Gershon) and a gangster's girlfriend (Jennifer Tilly) have a steamy affair and hatch a plot to steal $2 million from the Mafia in this tightly plotted thriller from the Wachowski brothers.  Of course, their scheme doesn't go as planned, resulting in a dizzying series of surprising developments and reversals that kept me guessing right up until the end.  Most of the action takes place in two neighboring apartments, but the Wachowski's way of shooting familiar objects from unexpected angles keeps the action from seeming claustrophobic.  Joe Pantoliano excels as the mid-level Mafioso Ceasar, a desperate man who proves to be less predictable than the two schemers expect.  This film is particularly impressive because it is the Wachowskis's first feature.
B000OLGCHA|2.0|I don't mean to dwell on the past, but Nicholas Hooper's music just doesn't seem to fit the Harry Potter films that we have come to love. The genius of John Williams and Patrick Doyle is definitely not matched in this \\"themeless\\" soundtrack. While change can be good, a composer such as Hans Zimmer may have been a better, more traditional choice. The Potter films have given rise to a modern classical style of music that rock-loving teenagers actually enjoy (something not seen since the Star Wars music accompanied the big-screen flicks). The new sound Hooper brings may represent the changes occurring in the wizarding world; however, it is more noise than music and lacks any sense of continuity.
B00006V9A0|3.0|k. cobain would be spinning in his grave if he knew this had been released (and if he had a grave he was cremated).  there is no way in hell that nirvanas greatness can be sumed up in 14 songs.  the ONLY reason this was released was for the very first song \\"you know youre right\\" which was the last track that cobain laid down in the studio with nirvana.  the track was supposed to be on the \\"with the lights out\\" compilation but courtney \\"yoko\\" love got in the way and put her two cents in which nobody wanted and started a fu c king mess saying that the song was too important to just be released on a compilation of demos and b-sides so they essentially made up a greatest hits album for the sole purpose of releasing that one song.  cash cow anyone?  kurt should have never hooked up with that gold-digging heffer.
B00000IMTH|5.0|When anyone looks back at the time Ronnie James Dio sang with Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow, the album Rising is the one mentioned as the masterpiece.  I have to admit that the 6 track album or CD is definitely on my top 100 list, but the group's follow-up effort, Long Live Rock `n' Roll is a very good to great album in its own way.  The opening title track announces what is in store and the following songs with Blackmore's riffing, Cozy Powell's imaginative drum beats and of course Dio's vocals just drive home the 8 songs contained within this release home.  The Gates of Babylon happens to be my favorite track with the moody and atmospheric keyboard opening to the memorable guitar riffs throughout.  Hell, even Yngwie Malmsteen covered this song a few years back.  Kill the King was the opening song for oh so many Rainbow shows, even though the opening guitar riff sounds very much like an early Rush riff.  Great song though and always announced the band with power and might.  The album closer, Rainbow Eyes is just a Dio vocal with orchestral backup, kind of the direction of Blackmore's Night has gone 3 decades later.  The song does take some getting used and I have to admit that I usually skip it after the onslaught of the other guitar/drum heavy tracks.  Check out a few snippets of the songs online and I am sure that you will want to here each one in their entirety!  I recommend this album highly and this will add to the ever increasing back catalogue of Ronnie James Dio's career.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Renee's accent may not be so convincing but her portrayal of B.P. was an interesting little mixture of Betty Davis and an Edith Wharton novel. The scenery is breathtaking and would have been excellent to see on the big screen or in person!  B.P.'s illustrations are superior. I was tickled to see that B.P. talked to her drawings. I used to yell at Jemimah Puddleduck for going near that fox when I was five yrs. old or so.

075640407X|4.0|I picked up Patrick Rothfuss's book on a whim one day. I was most surprised at how well the book flowed despite its length. Kvothe's struggles are real. This book wonderfully gets inside the head of a gifted young wizard who at the same time has to deal with tragedy and the poor decisions of youth. In this first book we get glimpses into the life of a bitter, internally-defeated man. We're left wondering where his story will go--maybe wondering too much. Save for a nasty schoolyard bully (who will have you tearing at the wall in anger) and a mysterious uber-evil fellow that pops up early in the story, the book is largely missing any sort of consistent antagonist. We are still not sure what Kvothe is fighting or has fought for. But I have faith that Rothfuss knows what he's doing and I'll be one of the first to reserve the next book. I've set down more \\"fantasy epics\\" partially read, than I've finished, and The Name of the Wind is one of those rare books that you turn off your phone to finish. I've been waiting a while to read something that feels like a story instead of a \\"brand.\\" And this is it. I've recommended it to friends, and they've all liked it.
B000003TAW|4.0|this album is great!  standouts are buddy holly, say it aint so and of course the sweater song but each and every song has something to offer.  i think this band was was overlooked due to the huge popularity of nirvana, pearl jam and stone temple pilots. i got into this album years after its release and am glad i finally picked up a copy.  the album is short, little over 40 minutes with 10 songs (why i gave it 4 stars).  also check out their green album.

B000I2J5UG|5.0|Such a great product!!!!  The cd was filled with great songs and the 72-page book kept me reading all night.  The book really helps you see the struggles MCR went through as a band to get to where they are now and there's great commentary on each of the songs by members of the band.  I highly reccommend this to any true MCR fan!!  And even if you're not a fan, you'd still enjoy it.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|James Bond is back and better than ever. Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. 007 in this movie is a lot more darker and ruthless than in the old 007 films. This is the most believable Bond movie out of the whole series. There's not too many gadgets in this movie and that is what makes it the most realistic of all too.       I'm glad they rebooted the franchise because it didn't make any sense to me that 007 has been working since the 60's and he still looks so  young. If Daniel Craig gets replaced they should find another actor who looks just like him.        This is one of the best Bond films that you have to see.
0786168811|5.0|I've read a ton of fiction. Conroy, Woods, Martini, Baldachi,(not to mention the classics).... But there was something so artfully compelling about this book ! It was exciting,interesting, and all the stuff you'd expect a good novel to be. Roberts treated us to a compelling philosophy about life interwoven among the thrilling plot. I always wondered how I, from the affluent USA, would fare in a third world country among world's poorest. (also how would one survive having to learn a new, complex language?) This book was interesting from that standpoint alone.  Also, it taught me to be less judgemental about people less \\"moral\\" than my own standards. Written beautifully from the Hero/Villian's point of view, the author writes brilliantly about the nature of good and evil.  Hats off to Gregory David Roberts !! A truly gifted and compelling author.  I eagerly anticipate the sequel.

This is one of my favirote films and I also think It's one of the best films ever made. If you haven't seen it I suggest you rent it or buy it somewhere NOW.

B000003TA4|5.0|Hi, I've never gotten tired of any song on this album.  It's loud, obnoxious, funny, tuneful, and entertaining.  Everyone on here over analyzes this album because they feel that they have to \\"set the masses straight.\\"  Listen, if you're new to Nirvana... this is their breakthrough album.  You'll see that a ton of people tend to dog this album because they're enangered by the fact that most people don't like whatever kind of leather, or spiked hair enducing music that THEY listen to.  The fact is that this is the first aggressively hard pop record ever made with any ammount of success to it's name.  The fact that every one who has followed this albumn and has been blasted on the radio sucks, is not in fact the bands fault... it's the fault of record companies trying to milk the sound that originated from them by selling [...] music to consumers.  This album is beyond good... it's not \\"depressing\\" as people might have you believe.  The depression from that era came from every other band who came out AFTER NIRVANA---namely Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden who were all serious and mentally unstable.  Though Kurt was unstable, he had the good sense of making fun of it all with jokes and puns rather than crying about it.  So now that I've set you straight, I hope that you'll give this album the chance it deserves instead of listening to the one star raters who purposely give this album no credit to piss people off and to be considered cool because they are different than the majority.

B00008NRL8|5.0|Let me tell you a little story: Once upon a time, there was a musical style known as Tango. It first appeared sometime around 1857.

B000000HTM|5.0|Luis Mejia (son) - VDGG is probably one of the most incredibly talented bands of the world, so hard to compare with any other band, but they exploded the sound barrier and extended the limit of the word \\"perfect\\" with this record.<br /><br />The album is the most original and complex material ever released by any rock band, even when it only has 3 tracks (apart from Theme One), it shows every aspect of mature sounds that could ever be released; it assimilates the greatest content of progressive rock, applying the most changing musical pattern in a cd that I've ever heard, the most stunning musical performance, the best mellodies applied by the band and the most strange and difficult to follow moods in a rock album. A MUST for every prog fan and every one who search incredible complexity and rythm combined. The album was released in 1971, but even though the critics were very impressed, the album went largely unnoticed for the charts, which demonstrate that Peter Hammill and his bandmates learned quickly from the big errors made in The Aerosol Gray Machine and the little mistakes made in both clever The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other and H To He, Who Am The Only One.<br /><br />Within the tracks, every song is unique and perfect; they seemed to go from more simple rythms from the first track to completely changing and complex rythms to the last track:<br /><br />1.

B000OCXM68|5.0|Michael, How impressive can you be??  ...\\"Me and Mrs Jones\\" is by far your most impressive song!  We saw you in concert last night and you brought us all to your hand with your rendition!  You are totally awesome with all your talent.
B000O75F7C|4.0|As a long term Porcupine Tree fan and in posession of every CD they have put out, I was really looking forward to F.O.A.B.P. I received my CD the day before a week's holiday in Greece, so immediately downloaded said product onto my mp3 player and listened to it continuosly (Alongside the new Rush CD \\"Snakes and Arrows\\"). I was present at a Manchester Gig where the band played the whole album six months before it was due to be released so I had a bit of an inclination as to what to expect. It sounded mostly like a continuation of their previous 2 albums (Deadwing and In Absentia) at the time, but having listened to the finished article, there were a couple of tracks where \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" came to mind on the 2 softer tracks (i.e. My Ashes and Sentimental)and a touch of \\"Sky moves sideways\\" atmospherics appears elsewhere. The begining of \\"My Ashes\\" is very close to Led Zeps \\"No Quarter\\". So much has been made of \\"Anesthetize\\", and yes, it is without doubt the highlight of the album. The opening to this song is monumental. However, I feel the album could have offered more to us, the fans. Firstly, I believe that \\"Anethetize\\" should have been chopped into two parts. After 12 or so minutes, it is turned into a completely different vibe and is like a totally new song. Steve Wilson had great joy at introducing the song at Manchester as \\"18 minutes long\\", and the crowd response was just as enthusiastic at hearing the news. Neal Morse's new CD has a 3 tracks on his new CD \\"Sola Scripture\\" averaging 23 min. each, and yet each is made up of 6 songs within it. In this case I would rather skip to a favourite piece of the track than have to fast forward. Prog. music is \\"Very much alive\\".  I would rather have 4 x 5 minute songs highlighting Mr Wilson's amazing musical talents than one stretched out piece. On \\"Voyage 34\\" that was a different story. AHHHHH Voyage 34. That brings me to another small matter. That CD (Or \\"EP\\" as it was known) totalled 60 min. whereas F.O.A.B.P. (A fullalbum release) totals only 50 min. Why is that so? Finally, I believe the 2 main ingredients that were lacking on this release were the trademark harmonies and also the lack of any guitar solos, apart from Alex Lifeson's shortis piece on Anesthetize. Steve seems to be putting more emphasis on the heavier chunky sound. Who knows, we could be witnessing an Opeth-like sound on their next release. To me, This CD was like listening to \\"Animals\\" after the release of \\"Wish you were here\\". Do you understand where I am coming from? Animals was a great album, but not up to the class of Wish you were here. I got more satisfaction listening to both the Blackfield albums honestly.     FOOTNOTE - I have just come across a tape of Steve talking on an English Radio station and explaining more about the concept of the album, and it really stuck with me i.e. about the information technology overload our kids have to indulge in. When you go into friends houses, all you see is kids on their Playstations/Nintendos/X box/Laptop etc. I must admit, Steve has really hit the button on an issue to write songs about. No doubt, there is more to come on this subject. For some people, the songwriting is the most important. For me, it is the music that is more paramount. I have to like the music first before I analyse the actual lyrics. When both are merged together in exceptional form the result is a CLASSIC.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|This album's excellence makes me literally drool out of both pride and satisfaction.<br />Pride: For the simple fact that the band has truly grown since their previous musical triumph, topping it with a much darker, richer, and more<br />promising piece of modern Alt/Punk Rock.<br />Satisfaction: Frankly, I'm astounded by the songs, made so excited I can barely contain myself everytime I blast them through my small room.<br />The first album was fast and sharp, teeming with bounce, wit, and charm.  They've lost none of that.  They simply seemed to have channeled that youthful vigor into a more profound stream of thought, the lyrics now more thoughtful and sophisticated, almost so personal that they're difficult to decipher.<br />As for the sound, listeners are immediately forced with the urge to swiftly bob along, dance outright, even.  The first album had this effect as well, but I feel that Favourite Worst Nightmare's strength generates more of a physical impression and reaction due to its profound uniqueness.<br />It's new and it's different and it boasts an overpowering sense of nuance, so noticably unique compared to today's endless spew of groups with similar sounds, lyrics, looks, and messages.<br />They are unlike any other, and I love them for it.
B000002GZ1|4.0|I say they don't make music like this anymore.Its a twist of Rolling Stones an Cream and for Mike Bloomfield, to me he is one of the best in his field. So if you like the Stones or Cream you will like this, enjoy.
0743289412|2.0|This book is a revisit of Rose Madder with a touch of Gerald's Game.    I think that Mr. King is running out of ideas.    I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot for this book.

0793518326|5.0|I've been trying to teach myself guitar for over two years now.  Being in my forties, I don't have the time (or talent)to sit with a CD/MP3 player and try to figure a song out.   I've purchased other song books, chordbooks, easy play books, etc...   Each one falls short in providing not only accurate information, but enough information for a relative beginner to play.  This book provides, in my opinion, all the necessary information for a beginner, expert, or cover band to play.  Notation, tab, chords, chord fingering and strumming patterns.  To date, this is the only book I would recommend.

B000OVLBEO|5.0|[[ASIN:B000OVLBEO Ghost Rider (Two-Disc Extended Cut)]]  As a fan of the comic books, I have to say that this was adapted extremely well.  There are some variations for the sake of cinematic visuals, but these variations were necessary in order to make this an enjoyably visual experience.  Otherwise, the film would have just laid there on the screen ... which this most definitely does NOT do!<br /><br />I can't say this is the greatest film ever made, but I CAN say that this is a highly enjoyable endeavor, filled with references to the comic book line, with an excellent performance contributed by Cage.  Some failed to appreciate his work this time around, and I have to say that they did not understand the complexity of the character, which Cage portrays in this work.<br /><br />I found it highly entertaining and well worth owning.  It has its rightful place in my collection, right next to Batman Begins, the Donner Superman collection, and Raimi's Spiderman run.
1593080255|5.0|this book is interesting and deep as it delves into the desires of man. the notes provided are helpful and add more to the overall quality of Wilde's own words
075640407X|5.0|A beautifully told story of a story within a story . . . with, hands-down, the best-developed and most believable characters - ever - within this genre. My admiration for this storyteller knows no bounds. He is not only a master wordsmith, but a careful and thoughtful observer of human nature and, for good and bad, the matters and secrets of the heart.    There is real magic within this book. Rothfuss, I do believe, knows the Name of the Story.
1932100385|5.0|This book is constantly, and I mean CONSTANTLY being borrowed from all the libraries in our city and three surrounding counties, absolutely no way to pick this off the shelf unless you request it.  I wasn't able to finish the last chapter before someone whisked it off.  People are reading and re-reading this because it rings true to how they feel when they eat and what they know about nutrition.  Best thing you can do for someone you love.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|This is one of those politically correct movies that you feel that you should like. Its protagonists are a smart, empathetic woman that acts upon deeply-felt emotions and her humble, self-effacing husband who loves her dearly. Both Ralph Fiennes and Rachael Weisz acted their roles brilliantly. But, oh my, what a ponderous, depressing movie. The character played by Ms. Weisz is of a deeply-committed human rights activist with more passion than good sense, supremely annoying to others that do not share her beliefs, and so committed to her cause that even her husband doubts her love for him vs. her committment to her cause. The scenes in Africa depict a land of such misery that it was painful to visit, even in a movie, let alone in person. The subjugation of the impoverished African people to powerful, wealthy drug companies playing research roulette with their lives was just one aspect of their misery. They are also shown as being harrassed by brutual bandits that are their own countrymen. The inhumanity of man to man on this continent by both visitors and natives was graphically illustrated. Other than revulsion, this movie did not elicit any other emotion.......it was neither uplifting nor satisfactory in its conclusion, nor did the characters engage me aside from admiration for the actors inhabiting these roles.
B00006JDVV|4.0|I went into this movie having known nothing about it but what the blurb on the back said.  The blurb gave the distinct impression of damsel-in-distress gets rescued....which this movie thankfully avoids.  The plot is so basic it could have been written over breakfast one day...the dialogue is so so, the special effects are decently done, the overall package is nice and short.  In truth, the movie pulls very few surprise moves which is refreshing.  The characters aren't super developed but they've got a bit of life and backstory to them.<br /><br />For an end of world type movie, it did all right in my eyes.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching the Illusionist. So much so, I had to watch a second time the very next night. This is something I very rarely do and done only with most interesting and haunting of films.<br /><br />This is a great story that blends a fascinating subject matter, romance, clever thinking, interesting, believable characters in a gorgeous storybook setting complete with lighting and scene selection worthy of a master artist.  Not a moment is wasted. No filler. The art direction has a lot to do with it, as each frame is beautiful to behold. But it's the story that keeps one's attention riveted. Excellent acting on all counts. And, of course, the wondrous illusions which Eisenheim so confidently and masterful displays are captivating, especially his most masterful illusion of all which the entire film revolves around, but I don't want to spoil it by giving any details.<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Illusionist is a tale about the triumph of love and true nobility over the fake kind that is passed down in a family lineage. 'Eisenheim'  embodies a truly Noble Spirit and does indeed triumph, but only through the most clever of strategies and after putting everything on the line, including his immense love for the Duchess Sophia, all of his money and possessions as he steps out in faith, stretching his skills of illusion beyond their previous limits.<br /><br />By the end of the film, you even start to like the myopic Police Inspector, who at first appears to be a narrow-minded, self aggrandizing tool of the powers that be, namely - the Crowned Prince. However he eventually displays his own nobility once he is certain of the truth, and even shows fond admiration for his previous adversary's brilliance in single handedly obtaining true justice. And the ultimate fate of the Crowned Prince is as poetic as can be imagined.  It's one of those quirky twists in life that, when they happen, you can only chock up to divine providence, it is so perfect.<br /><br />Like most good films, this one deserves to be watched closely, as there are lots of details that all hold relevance. But that is not hard to do, for who would want to miss a single frame of these gorgeous recreated scenes of Vienna around 1900? That alone is worth the price of admission. Great film, very well done and added promptly to my favorites list.rves to be watched closely, as there are lots of details that all hold relevance.

B000244FDW|2.0|I bought this in high school after reading (and LOVING) the novel and watching watching clips from what my teacher called \\"the BBC miniseries.\\"  I didn't realize that the version we saw was actually the A&E/BBC version, and bought this one by accident.  What a disappointment!  Yes, as many people have pointed out, it is very accurate.  However, when I read the book, I felt like the characters were alive, but did not feel that at all when I watched this version.  Needless to say, it hasn't come out of its case since that afternoon of disappointed viewing.
074356619X|1.0|This is simply Biblical truths retold for people who do not want to look into the Bible today. Jesus told us all of this!!! I guess a secular society needs a secular book.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I finally bought this after renting it about five times.  By now I've seen it more than any other movie, I'm sure, and will never tire of it.  If I'm ever having a blah week, I pop it in, and like magic, I'm cheered up.  It's truly delightful.
B000P2A256|4.0|This cd is slightly different in music style than Maroon 5's first cd, but I am enjoying it nonetheless.  If you are currently a Maroon 5 fan than this cd will not dissapoint you!
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Although I have great regard for many of the comics and graphic novels alan moore has done, in the case of V for Vendetta, the series was at times, muddled and the storytelling, not always clear. In fact, the comic series was what kept me away from the movie from so long! I just did finally watch the movie the other day though and was very pleased. It presented the story in a much clearer and cohesive fashion. Usually, hollywood does nothing but screw things up but once in a while, although it's VERY rare, they improve on a comic. This is one of those times. No, moore's unhappy with it. Moore's unhappy with so many things, I have to say \\"get over yourself, Alan\\". they did a better job telling the story than you did. While I really can't recommend the comic--although the art was nice, I can recommend the movie. and I'd honestly give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|Everyone that I talked to said they heard the critics bash this cd and I strongly dissagree. Yes it is very different than her other cds but a refreshing change. It doesn't have the cookie cutter poppie sound. It's more of the rock style and she pulls it off! Get it and decide for yourself!
B0002S947K|5.0|I know I've heard tracks from this record used on TV shows, and there's a good reason for that.  Ray LaMontagne has a husky yet listenable voice, articulate lyrics, and a range of melodies.  Taylor Hicks would do well to try to emulate his idol further.

Whether it does or not is important to me because it will live with me.  The new Doctor Who is not only for the fans nor is the music. This music will appeal to anyone so check out the shows and relate to the music! The theme has completely re-invented and I love that but I might say that without the Mark Ayres' and the Dominic Glynn's...where would we be now?  I love this.
B000OQF6N6|4.0|Never mind getting upset about this being a true \\"reunion\\" album without the original quartet.    On this album, Billy and Jimmy pick up the pieces after Zwan disintegrated and make the hard rocking Pumpkins sound I had hoped for with MACHINA.  True, this does not live up to the standard if you are using Siamese Dream and Mellon Collie as a measuring stick, but Zeitgeist outdoes anything being put out these days by Nickelback clones.  If you are upset about James and D'arcy being absent, remember that a majority of their studio sound was just Billy and Jimmy to begin with.  Get off your high horse and give it chance.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|I think Tom Selleck is great in this role. He has proved what a great actpor he is, in many tv shows, and those wonderful westerns. Jesse Stone is so believable - a very down-to-earth cop. I really enjoy this series.

B000LC55F2|3.0|\\"It is inhuman to be so cold\\", says one of the film's characters, and that's what \\"The Prestige\\" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as \\"Memento\\" meets \\"Rashômon\\" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer \\"The Illusionist\\" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|Seriously because their albums are the gift that keeps on giving. They get better with every subsequent listen. The first time this music comes through your speakers you become dizzy because of the intensity and constant shifts in tempo but if you let go of the reins and abandon yourself to the rythm you can perceive its true beauty.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|A wicked comeback for Rush in the '00s. They are officially back with a tight performance. Excellent guitar sounds and layering are found throughout 'Snakes and Arrows' with often hypnotic vocal melodies.<br /><br />You don't have to know anything about music to recognize the Hemispheres chord on track 1. With the next 3 songs, I get a strange but intriguing hook vibe found only on early 80's album 'Signals'. Also note there is a brilliant acoustic guitar short piece \\"Hope\\".<br /><br />A lacking blues jam intro and oblique chorus hooks grouped later on 'Snakes and Arrows' don't represent old rush or new. This is one of many reasons why I would not rank this in the top 5 best Rush ever.<br /><br />But to end on a positive note, I'm am totally surprised these guys still have their hearing and abilities with nearly 20 studio albums and decades of touring. They have not lost their chops one bit!

B000PWQPAC|4.0|I've been a fan of Ghost in the Shell and all it's iterations since I saw the first movie in the early 90s... it is a science fiction phenomena, and a sounding board for discussions of the heady topics of transhumanism, cyberization, and the information society.<br /><br />But as entertainment, is it for everyone?  Well, probably not.  And having watched this latest entry I can't see someone who had never seen any of it's pre-cursors following this labyrinthine plot for very long without getting irritated and switching it off.  If you're not a fan of anime, this movie certainly won't sway you like a Miyazaki movie might.<br /><br />But to it's credit:  thoughtful, dense science fiction, focused on a very real social dilemma of Japan (the growth of state-hospitalized elederly against a declining birthrate/workforce), some of the finest computer enhanced (the lighting and color schemes are brilliant) animation to date, excellent music by Yoko Kanno (as usual) and wonderful english voice acting.  If you're collecting the series, come and get it!  It's top-notch.<br /><br />If you've never seen it?  Well, I'd rent it, and if you like it, there's an excellent tv show I'd like to recommend...  ;)
B000Q76K24|5.0|This was a great movie that I really enjoyed.    Be warned though that there are alot of details given through out the movie that if you aren't watching carefully you will miss or not understand other parts in the movie. But once I was able to catch all the little details in the movie I could really enjoy it.    I think its great how through parts of the movie you are lead to question if the Russians are beating him in the intelligence arena. Then there is the scene where he gives a dollar to the one Russian. But this is more proof that you have to watch the small details and listen carefully to all the lessons that he is taught in the beginning about intelligence and counter-intelligence.    Awesome movie that you will definitely want to watch over and over.
0743298020|3.0|It is an easy read and very romantic. The biggest down fall is that the plots are very predictable... there are a few intriguing and innovating ideas, but I don't believe it is as profoundly written as it is advertised. Overall, it is an entertaining story.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I've always heard of this group but never heard any of their songs until a few months ago. I heard Sweet Sacrifice.  Going through a hard time with my boyfriend, it felt good that someone else was belting out my pain and frustration.  I even downloaded some older songs later like Going Under and My Immortal (Okay, not a hard rock song but beautiful all the same).
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I loved the movie, but I love the music even more.  This is an excellent CD with only one problem - the last song (which is my favorite) is not long enough.  It's easy to picture scenes from the movie while listening to each song. If you enjoy the symphony you will enjoy this CD.  Happy listening!
B000P2A24W|4.0|Yeah, if I'd never heard this sound before I may have given it 5 stars, because it sounds very good.<br /><br />However, if you're at all familiar with The Jayhawks, especially the brilliant and criminally overlooked \\"Smile\\" then you've heard this before.<br /><br />They may call it country in some reviews but others have identified this sound as \\"Americana\\" and that's what I'm going with. Harmonies, strings, beats and rhythms, it's all here as clear and crisp as Bon Jovi can give it.<br /><br />Go ahead and give it a whirl and, if you like it, listen to \\"Smile\\" by The Jayhawks also.<br /><br />Nice stuff.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I have always loved Peter Pan. The Mary Martin version was my favorite, until this one came out. Now, nothing beats this version, in my opinion! I could watch it over and over, and I'm 56 years old. Of course, I bought it for my two grandchildren who are 5 and 8 LOL!
B00005QAPH|3.0|Self-absorbed and vain, the movie was novel for it's time, taking a \\"critical\\" look at the movie making process and it's often shallow  and materialistic nature.  Unfortunately, this is a well worn theme  by now.  It's egotistical self-fawning is reminiscent of Woody Allen's  Stardust Memories, which is also an annoyingly narcissitic work.  I love \\"art movies\\", but along with Bergman, Truffaut and others, Fellini  is often overrated.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|This CD is incredible.  Every song is well written.  Think back to the days of Powerslave or Piece of Mind.  It's that great.  Vocally, Bruce is as sharp as ever.  Guitars are strong and razor sharp.  Drum scores are creative and present, if that makes any sense.  If you are a long time Maiden fan, this will not dissapoint at all.  If you are a new listener, sit back and enjoy the ride.  If the songs were shorter, they could grab more air time.
B00067BBQE|3.0|...that the CD also comes with a DVD?  I bought both, and gave this one away.  Save yourself some money and get that CD/DVD combo instead of this DVD.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|Riot! is a great sophmore record for Paramore. The trio of \\"Misery Business\\", \\"Born For This\\", and \\"Hallelujah\\"  are the songs that really stand out but that doesn't mean the rest of the album doesn't. Every song stands on its own and is amazing. Hayley William's vocals are ten times better [than on All We Know Is Falling], Josh Farro and Jeremy Davis' guitar parts are brilliant and Zac Farro delivers fantastic drum parts. Most of the album is catchy,fun pop-rock songs but songs like \\"We Are Broken\\", \\"When It Rains\\", and \\"crushcrushcrush\\" show Paramore's softer/darker side.          The only complaints I have about Riot! are:          a.) \\"We Are Broken\\". It's a good song, you get attached after awhile, but it's a bit sappy and isn't at Riot!s best.           b.) Riot! sounds more like a follower, not a leader.            Overall: If you were a fan of Paramore before there's a very good chance you'll love this album. New fans'll also love it. Buy Riot! you won't be dissapointed.
B000000OF6|3.0|FYI - if it's early Queen you're interested in - you know, stuff before that lemon of an album \\"Bicycle Races\\" - I strongly urge you to buy the original albums (starting with \\"A Day at the Races\\").
B000NVT0RU|3.0|This is NOT a \\"sweeping war epic\\" by miles and miles.  It is first and foremost a distinctly French movie with its prime goal being to make modern Frenchmen feel guilty about not treating colonial Muslim troops better during WWII.  Sure, that's an issue to be addressed, but then again, minority troops in every army of WWII were treated as second class soldiers regardless of whom they were fighting for.  That's the way it always has been and always will be.<br /><br />The movie itself is okay, not great, but worth having if you can get it discounted because the uniforms and equipment used in the flick is top notch.  They use a mixture of correct Lebel rifles, Enfield P14s, and even a few M1 Garands, and mix cast-off American, French, and British uniforms and equipment which is precisely what the 3rd Algerian Division wore and used.  I was greatly bummed at the beginning of the flick when they were using modern military trucks and a Vietnam era M151 Jeep for vehicles, but those vanished when they changed filming locations later.<br /><br />There are only two battle scenes in this movie, both of which are extremely weak when compared to Private Ryan, Flags of our Fathers, Letters from Iwo, Enemy at the Gates, etc.  The 3rd Algerian only participated in a couple of relatively minor battles, one in Italy and in the recapture of Alsace in 1944, and in neither case did the Algerian troops perform well.  This is somewhat illustrated in the Alsace version of their fight, but only because they are seemingly overwhelmed.  That was not the historical case, they simply were poorly trained, and being under French command, their natural instincts were to surrender or retreat anyway!<br /><br />It's a decent movie, but it has a lot more social commentary in it than war movie, and it's kinda' dopey in spots because of the French film making.  Some of it's just kinda' dumb, like when the screen says they're in the Ruhr Valley and they're filmed hiking through ominous looking mountains!  Well, duh.<br /><br />And WHEN is someone going to make a movie about the hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen who VOLUNTEERED to serve in the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS during WWII?  These men far outnumbered the often touted French Resistance, yet the story of the Charlemagne Division of the Third Reich and the other French troops who wore the German helmet is brushed under the rug today.  Let's see an epic about that!  I'm not holding my breath though...<br /><br />Add it to your military video collection, just don't look for this one to be anything near Private Ryan, Stalingrad, or any of the true epics out there.  For my money, \\"Saints and Soldiers\\" is still the best unsung movie about WWII that never got the praise or rewards it deserved, and it was done on a budget of under $1 million!And WHEN is someone going to make a movie about the hundreds of thousands of Frenchmen who VOLUNTEERED to serve in the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS during WWII?

B000GG4KTU|2.0|I listened Diana Krall live in concert tonight. I did not know much about her except that she is regarded as one of the greatest jazz artists of our generation which made me feel rather ignorant as I am a big fan of jazz.  She played for an hour and a half tonight and she is obviously a talented musician.  However, one thing struck me as odd ... for one of the shining lights of modern jazz, she sang one, ONE, original song.  All of the music she played were covers of some of the greatest jazz music ever recorded.  What became evident is that this talented woman bears a talent that is only skin deep.  The one original song that she sang was horrendous, a lyrical disaster.  I cringed each and every time the refrain was repeated.  Granted the crowd, purveyors of insipid music one and all, ate it up.  Her own music can't all be that bad can it?  I walked away with the thought that music, as in fine arts, has simply become a playground for lazy artists to appeal to lazy fans who don't expect any more than rote regurgitation.  Diana Krall is a cover artist.  What galls me about her fame and fortune is that talent alone didn't make her famous.  Is it because she's an attractive woman who can tickle the keys of a piano and sing in a sultry voice?  There are multitudes of rock cover bands who get ridiculed for playing songs they didn't write. So, why does this woman get lauded for doing the same thing?  Talented yes, but genius? ... to compare her to Cole Porter or Nat King Cole would be sinful.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|It's amazing to consider that with the DVD release of \\"Forbidden Planet\\", this classic sci-fi film is viewable in the wide-screen format for the first time since its original theatrical run some 50 years ago. It's clear that the \\"full-screen\\", pan and scan format simply does not work for some films and \\"Forbidden Planet\\" is a prime example. Suspenseful, beautifully written by Cyril Hume (a descendant of the philosopher), and gorgeous to look at, this wonderful transfer restores and reveals the masterpiece that's been hidden for so long. Those of us who grew up watching it on TV or on the hopelessly inadequate full-screen VHS version have cause to celebrate.

B0000041LO|4.0|I have arrived at the view that Haydn is for the musically more mature; this is after nearly sixty years of avoiding him - I have come to regret the wasting of so much time!     Like many people, I have considered Haydn principally in terms of his \\"thousands\\" of symphonies and felt the title \\"Papa\\" probably apposite. However, having spent an increasing amount of time in getting to know his chamber works, I have altered my opinions dramatically and have long since thought Schumann's judgment facile and ungrateful.    Haydn shared a few years of the middle of the 18th. century with Bach and given his following so closely upon the heels of the Barok, his music is astonishingly innovative and I think he receives far too little credit for the pioneering work he did. His string quartets truly are of the first order and given that he \\"invented\\" the genre, extraordinarily forward and musically developed. Mozart did nothing to advance the form which Haydn left as a wonderful foundation upon which Beethoven and Schubert could build.    Whilst many of the quartets have a certain cerebral aspect to them, the piano trios do not. Not because of any lack of inventiveness on the part of the composer but due to their being intended for a larger and different audience to whom Haydn's publishers might sell a lot of sheet music; it should be remembered that Haydn was widely known and popular from Italy to Sweden. There is no hint of \\"commercialism\\" in these works however.    This complete set of piano trios has a strong homogeneity; they all fit together well and balance nicely. A quirky exception here is the very individual E major Allegretto (Hob.XV:28) heralding a chorale prelude and later suggesting that we are in for a three part fugue. No chorale, no fugue. Another of Haydn's witticisms perhaps?     The Beaux Arts' readings are \\"safe\\" and I have no quibble with this. Another reviewer has found them \\"bland\\" but with this I do not agree. Frankly, I think it difficult to make a proper judgment because, as has been pointed out elsewhere, the strings are not at all well recorded and for much of the time the pieces sound like a piano sonata with occasional string accompaniment.     This situation is less annoying than it otherwise might be as the piano really has a stand-alone part and the overall nature of the works is surprisingly undiminished in the apparent absence of the strings. In any event, the violin and more particularly the 'cello whose principal function was to bolster the rather fragile bass of the early Viennese fortepiano, don't have much to say that is of great musical consequence. To a degree, this \\"imbalance\\" is characteristic of the trio form as it was employed by Mozart, Beethoven and others; it was well into the nineteenth century before Mendelssohn distributed the musical parts more evenly but a contrived imbalance of musical composition is one thing - that of shortcomings of recording quality is quite another. The \\"solo\\" nature of the piano in this instance merely serves to demonstrate what an unusually fine pianist Menahem Pressler is. In other respects the recording is very good.    These trios are immensely satisfying, partly due to their delightful nature and partly because they don't demand much in the way of intellectual involvement from the listener. I should like to have awarded five stars; generally, the set deserves them but I feel some penalty has to be imposed in respect of the poor microphone balance. Musically, this collection is a superbly performed joy and others surely will share my delight in it.

0553801511|4.0|FitzChivalry Farseer narrates \\"The Tawny Man:  Golden Fool\\", the second novel in \\"The Tawny Man Trilogy\\", resuming his Tom Badgerlock persona.  The storyline slowly builds surrounding the Chalced and Piebald threats upon the kingdom and Prince Dutiful's betrothal with the Outislanders' Narcheska.  Further concerns from \\"The Liveship Traders Trilogy\\" could potentially impact the overall plot.<br /><br />Fitz adjusts to city life at Buckkeep among the associated court intrigue, yet he spends more time complaining about his own duties and arguing with everyone else.  Web, a charming person of the Old Blood, and Swift, one of Burrich's sons, emerge near the end as prospective companions.  Sadly, the hedge-witch Jinna has been reduced to more of a more minor role after an engaging initial appearance.<br /><br />In a series based on relationships and the motivations thereof, the loss of Nighteyes not only made a noteworthy impact on the former assassin but also left a gap in the cast of characters and changed the plot flow after four novels.  Fitz places significant emphasis on the strain between he and the Fool with their roles as the Catalyst and White Prophet in addition to the burden of the student and teacher interaction.  A more detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix would have been useful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I have been a Kelly Clarkson fan since the beginning, but I'll admit, the first listen didn't hook me, like Breakaway did.  However,the second time around, I was impressed with the variety in styles of the songs.  The lyrics, while simple, are honest and soul baring.  I love the accoustic songs; Sober,and Irvine are hypnotic; and as always, Kelly brings her wonderful vocals that never fails to amaze me.  She is truly growing as an artist and songwriter.  Bravo to Kelly for sticking up for herself and taking the chance to put out an album that the moguls think will fail.  My December may not be #1 on the charts, but I think substance and talent should always prevail over overprocessed and bubble gum tarts that are too common these days (ah, ashlee simpson, rhianna, etc!)  Kelly Clarkson definitely has the talent and the voice for staying power, regardless of what Clive Davis thinks!  I look forward to her rescheduling her tour, because I will definitely go to her next concert!

I'd give 6 stars if they allowed them!

B000OQF6N6|4.0|I think that Smashing Pumpkins (or what is left of them) has done a great job on their recent cd, Zeitgeist.  Although the band is missing both Iha and the always changing bass player, the band remains the Pumpkins.  Of course the teenage/young adult angst of Billy Corgan has vanished for a more introspective and (gasp) spiritual version.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, I think that the cd has more interesting lyrics, and its very much in the vein of Billy Corgan's adventure with Zwan.   Actually, its very similar to Zwan if not the same, but with Billy doing all the guitar/bass work by himself and Jimmy Chamberlain on the drums.  The songs are motivational for the most part, and upbeat.   The best songs on the cd are \\"For God and Country,\\"  \\"Tarantula,\\" and \\"Revolution.\\"   Billy's guitars scream as Pumpkin's listeners and fans are accustomed too, and his voice whines away.  Chamberlain is brilliant on \\"Revolution.\\"   The last song \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" is fairly over the top, and the only track that I wasn't thrilled about.  Having purchased all of Smashing Pumpkins and Billy Corgan's other efforts on cd, I think that Zeigeist fits right in, somewhere between the brilliant work the Pumpkins did on Siamese Dream and Corgan's tryst with Zwan.    Recommended for any serious fan, or casual listener..
0156421178|5.0|George Orwell must be an excellent writer because, in all honesty, I wasn't overwhelmingly interested in reading about the Spanish Civil War.  Nevertheless, I really, really liked this book.<br /><br />Understanding the history behind the war isn't a necessity, but I definitely recommend bringing yourself up to speed via wikipedia before starting.  That way, Orwell's personal recollections, which are the meat of the book, will be more relevant to you.<br /><br />Orwell presents a refreshingly honest account of the war and his own evolving take on it.  Spain's resulting chaos is a prescient warning for those who take too passionately and seriously partisan politics.  Orwell shows that it never takes too long before ideals are thrown out the window to be replaced by the centuries repeated same old quest for power.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the Spanish Civil War, human nature's struggle for power, or Orwell's insightful, often humorous observations.

0552998087|3.0|I got this book from a book-swapping club and thought, since I love travel stories, I would definitely enjoy this one. I have not heard of Bill Bryson before and thought, oh, a traveling memoir ... it's perfect for summer (and for the lull before the Harry Potter storm, of which I am very anxiously waiting for the last book ...). This book is funny ~~ if you like juvenile potty humor. I have to be in the mood for it. I was in the mood for it. Normally, I am not in the mood for it since it is crude and distasteful in my opinion (which doesn't really matter much anyways!).     There is one big big gripe about this book. He totally dissed on Ohio. Well, duh. If you only travel the turnpike in Ohio up to I-75 ~~ yeah, you're not going to find anything remotely attractive about the interstates. On page 172 of my book, he mentioned that he \\"awoke early and experienced the sinking senation that overcomes you when you first open your eyes and realize that instead of a normal day ahead of you, with its scatterings of simple gratifications, you are going to have a day without even the tiniest of pleasures; you are going to drive across Ohio.\\" He must have never taken a childhood vacation in Ohio. I've been through Iowa and had strep throat in his hometown of Des Moines on our way back from the Rockies ~~ all I can say is that Des Moines is fortunate enough to have a Steak and Shake because I was dying of pain and they have the best milk shakes ... and a great book store too. I'd like to point out to Mr. Bryson that he needs to check out Ohio again ~~ this time, travel on the backroads. It is a beautiful state ~~ one of the nicests in the good ol' USA.    I digress. Other than the dissing of my home state, he was funny in all respects of his travels. But after awhile, you can only make fun of the people in different states for so long and after awhile, you start wishing he'd stay in places longer than a night or for a cup of coffee. Then you wish for a more indepth book on traveling stories ... but it's not that kind of book, so it is disappointing when you find out that he's just going to make fun of the natives across America. He is funny but then he isn't funny. You just have to read this book to know what I mean. However, he sure hit the RV travelers dead on! When I worked at Yellowstone National Park in my youth, we called those tourists, tourons simply because they're tourists and morons at the same time. Not very nice, I know, but I was very young. Bryson's comments about the tourists were right on though and did make me laugh.      I am not rushing out to buy another Bill Bryson book because this is the first one I've read and I am not sure if it's worth the money to read him again. But then again, I might give him another chance ~~ but hopefully, his tastes have matured to where he's actually funny and insightful, instead of funny and juvenile.     7-18-07

I found it interesting that many comments state that Kelly has matured on this cd this could not be farther from the truth. The lyrics are at times whinney, bitter, and down right nasty. Aspects which do not automatically prove maturity. Do not buy this cd it is a waste of money!!! I'm sorry I did.
B00005JPKE|5.0|In this sequel to his earlier film Flags of Our Fathers (although you can watch either film first), director Clint Eastwood tells the story of that famous battle from the perspective of our enemy and the losers, the Japanese soldiers. Japan's 22,000 soldiers fought bravely for forty days against an American invasion of 70,000 troops; only 2,000 Japanese survived the carnage. The film does a remarkable job of helping us to view our ostensible \\"enemies\\" as fellow human beings; in almost every respect the combatants are mirror images of each other. They complain about army food, make crude jokes about women, see through the lies that their own government feeds them, fight bravely despite being horribly under-resourced, cuss at broken equipment, make the best of a dehumanizing task, and receive and write letters to their loved ones back home. When a Japanese soldier reads a letter that he took from a dead American he remarks, \\"I was taught to believe that the Americans were cowards and savages, but when I read this letter from the soldier's mother I realize that he is just like me.\\" In Japanese with English sub-titles.
0345404475|4.0|It's hard to review \\"Androids\\" without referring to Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner but I'll try to do it.    Rick Deckard is a bounty hunter hunting androids in a post World War III America.  In his spare time he tends to his robot sheep which grazes on the roof of his apartment building.  He saves his bounty money in the hopes of buying a real animal--a status symbol in a society where nearly all the animals are articifical.  The conflict is that Rick empathizes with his quarry.  He may even be an android himself.      Phillip K. Dick presents a parable which comments on war, the environment, faith, technology, commerce, racism and humanity.  The book is Dark witha capital \\"D\\", to the point of being nihilistic.  At the heart is the question, \\"What makes us human?\\"  To say more would spoil the book.    Most of the book is dialogue.  The description is minimal and for a book which features an android hunter as its protagonist, the action is minimal.  Action scenes are typically about one sentence long.  (Example: \\"He shot her.\\")  This is a philosophical work, not an action yarn.    My biggest problem with \\"Androids\\" is the lack of a primary antagonist.  There is no main \\"bad guy\\" and the villains don't seem to want anything other than to be left alone. This is results in a notable lack of rising action and suspense.            If you like dark sci-fi, however, this should be at the top of your reading list.
B000089RV6|5.0|I'm going to rate this CD based on a $1 per song cost to total cost for the entire CD (Apple and Rhapsody charge $1 per song). Unfortunately, iTunes doesn't carry any AC/DC songs at the moment.   This CD is perfectly priced. 10 great songs for $10. If you don't already own the CD, the popular songs you'll know are Hells Bells, Back In Black and You Shook Me All Night Long. If you like them, then the rest of the songs on this CD won't take long to grow on you. Especially, Let Me Put My Love Into You. I promise that this CD will not disappoint.   This is one of my three favorite Hard Rock/Heavy Metal albums from the early 1980's. The other two are Judas Priest's \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and Def Leppard's \\"Pyromania\\".  Hope this helps.   Darium
B000PTYP5C|5.0|This is another great album from Dream Theater. For me, this one couldn't beat the previous one (Octavarium). It's because this one they were focusing to create more heavy songs. That's really great, but for me I prefer a little bit more light. Just a little bit, like Octavarium. If you are a progressive music lover and a heavy metal lover as well, Dream Theater is your band. If you like a little bit more Heavy than Progressive, this is your album.<br /><br />Enjoy!!!!
B00005JPQT|5.0|The original [[ASIN:B000SZK41M Die Hard]] was a cheesy masterpiece, a shot in the arm for the genre.  Watching it now, one is amazed at the number of cliches that the makers managed to cram into every crevice of the plot; they only seem like cliches now, though, because so many other action films have incorporated them so shamelessly in the interim.  Aside from the tired second installment (the working title was \\"Die Hard: In An Airport This Time!\\"), the franchise, even at this late date, shows considerable steam.  That is to say, if you like action movies, you should LOVE this thing.<br /><br />Bruce Willis is back, balder than ever, as John McClane, a New York cop who can never catch a break.  This time around, not only are homegrown terrorists sticking their fingers into every digital device in the country, but his daughter has also pretty much disowned him.  Timothy Olyphant (I will always know him as the stubbornly practical drug dealer from [[ASIN:0767835093 Go]]) is our Main Bad Guy, a national securities expert who was dismissed and disgraced by our country's leaders for daring to suggest that our computers needed a few more firewalls.  He returns with a giant truck full of fancy electronics and less-fancy hackers in an attempt to wreck havoc and steal money (or digital files that represent money these days).<br /><br />The start-up work for his Terrorist Inc. was done by a group of clueless computer nerds who have since been dispassionately dispatched of by a team of big-jawed foreign men with oversized guns (natch).  All of them, that is, except one: Matt Farrell, played by Justin \\"almost, but not quite, Tom Hanks, Jr.\\" Long.  When the nation's head servers experience a troubling blip, every techno-geek in the country is summoned, and McClane is sent to grab Farrell.  Just in time to stop him from being ventilated and charred by the Vanload Of Henchmen.<br /><br />With America experiencing the national equivalent of a seizure (traffic systems down! phones no longer work! power goes out everywhere! walkie talkies hish annoyingly! the only thing on TV are old State of the Union speeches! Noooooooo!), it's up to the blunt force of McClane and the wire-wise smarts of Farrell to take down the almost-omniscient cyber-villains.<br /><br />Willis, as gruffly charming as ever, is starting to show his age here, but the movie actually capitalizes on that.  It means that he doesn't crack wise as often as you'd might expect, but it does give us a chance to watch him fuss over his grumpy daughter when she gets felt up by a lascivious (non)boyfriend.  It also makes a perfect counter-point to Long's stumbling sensibleness, an act he's perfected since his [[ASIN:B000IZJZIU Accepted]] days.  After a perfectly choreographed disaster sequence involving a dark tunnel, several dozen collisions, and a helicopter, McClane is noticeably hurt.  As the two limp away from the wreckage, Farrell says, \\"Hey, this is no joke.  You should go to the hospital.  I'm not a doctor, but it looks like you're hurt.\\"  McClane grimaces and says, \\"Sexy, isn't it?\\"<br /><br />Even when McClane isn't wrily thumbing his nose at these ridiculous action movie conventions (\\"Where do you get all your henchman?\\" he asks Olyphant.  \\"Is there an 800 number you can call?\\"), he's waxing prosaic about the more human impact of being a hero.  In some movies, this would be the lag where you run to get a refill on your soda, but Willis and Long pull off the moment without resorting to overfed emotion.  It shows McClane at his most vulnerable, which makes the ensuing theatrics all the more exciting.<br /><br />For what it wants to be, \\"Live Free or Die Hard\\" is a rousing success.  In fact, I'm hard-pressed to think of anything that's wrong with the film.  It shows strides beyond the days of its granddaddy, and even if there is still a little cheese left in the series, it's served up glowing red and bubbling hot.  The lactose-intolerant should stay away.  The rest of you shouldhave a seat, grab a snack, and say, \\"Yippie-kay-yay.\\"yay.\\"
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This mini-series is, to put it simply, the most amazing visual experience.  I recorded every show in HD on my DVR, and have watched every episode repeatedly.  I was thrilled to discover that the Planet Earth series was available on DVD, and promptly purchased the set.    I was disappointed to find that the DVD video quality is less than impressive when viewed on an HD monitor.  This is understandable, given that a standard resolution DVD (480 lines) has considerably fewer lines of resolution than your typical HD television (1080 lines).  But what bothered me was the number of scenes that contain digital artifacts - an indication that the video was over-compressed.  Artifacts (where video looks \\"blocky\\" or prismatic) were especially noticeable during scenes containing lots of trees, or flocks of birds, running water, or aerial shots of roaming herds.  The video quality could have been better, even for a standard definition DVD.    My 5 star rating is for the content of the Planet Earth series. (If I could rate separately the quality of the video on the DVD, I would only give it 3 stars.) If you have a standard definition TV, the video quality of the DVD will probably be acceptable.  Videophiles should opt for either the HD-DVD or Blu-Ray version of this show, as I plan to do very soon.
1401307787|3.0|I brought this book after hearing Jon on an Australian radio program and really liked hearing what he had to say. I've been meditating for about 20 years and usually practice most morning. I've read a lot of books on the subject and have visited Ashrams and studied Yoga in India on my travels. If you are new to the subject them I would recommend this book as Jon has a lot of useful and interesting things to say. If you have been doing meditation for a number of years then you will not really learn anything new. I don't want to sound arrogant but I've read most of what he has to say in other books. Meditation is basically just being in the moment. Just focusing on one thing, either an object, breath or mantra.  If you are new to meditation it may be worth trying a few different styles of meditation to see what is best suited to you as we are all unique. What maybe good for one person will not necessary be good for someone else. I would also recommend reading other books on the topic. After you have read a few books they all basically say the same thing, \\"Just focus on the moment\\"
0810993139|5.0|My 7 year old son burned through this book in a week! The illustrations are classic, the prose easy to understand, the subject matter: hilarious and appropriate for children who often wonder if their parents are the only ones who make a bunch of rules which seem to revolve around not letting them play  the cool video games or eat junk food. It touches on the scatological, as well, and made my son lose his breath laughing on many occasions. I can't wait to see if there is a follow-up!
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is just one of those films in which everything comes together--great screenplay (based on a great novella), great performances by Tim Robbins (my hero) and Morgan Freeman (my ultra-hero).  Freeman's narration fills in some of the nice passages from the book--a nice touch which makes this movie all the better.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A great end to an even better series. Serenity continues where the TV series, Firefly, left off. It nicely wraps up all the storylines that were abruptly cut off from the series cancellation. This movie is very action-packed and fun.<br /><br />Oh, and Joss... Wash will have his revenge!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Like Shawshank Redemption, this is a great film based on some of Stephen King's best work.  It is poignant, nostalgic--and hilarious at times. (And some of us may never wade in ponds again because of it!)
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This captivating series was, unfortunately, cut short through its first season of airing. Fox, as they have many times before, canned an excellent series before it barely got off the ground. Joss Whedon had an awesome series in Firefly with an even better cast.<br /><br />The characters in Firefly were very intriguing and deep. The show was very character driven. For anyone looking for a great series to entertain themselves with that is very memorable, look no further.

B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a very different from the first film.  Vol. 1 is a Hong Kong/Japanese Samurai flick, Vol. 2 is more of a Spaghetti Western.  What comes to mind when I watch this great film, is Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy.  Tarantino keeps up the pace with his smooth dialogue, funny scenes and honorable emotion.  I hope you enjoy this wonderful film as much as I did. Be sure to check out Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, coming soon!
B0001CNRB6|4.0|Even though it seems like Doris Day and Rock Hudson made as many films as Tracy and Hepburn, they actually made just three for Universal between 1959 and 1964. The trio of films Day and Hudson made hardly reflects pinnacles in cinema history, but they show what deft writing, nimble direction and expert farceurs can do to make these souffl&eacute;-light romantic comedies thoroughly enjoyable. As my favorite of the three, this frenetic 1961 farce evolves from a familiar act of deception initiated by Hudson's character, at which point it becomes a series of humiliations and comeuppances for both principals before the inevitable happy ending.<br /><br />Directed by Delbert Mann and written by Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning, the movie works the exact same plot devices as 1959's [[ASIN:B0001CNRC0 Pillow Talk]], even the split-screen confrontations, but converts the pair into highly competitive advertising account executives at separate agencies. This time, Day is even more priggish as Carol Templeton, who loathes Hudson's Jerry Webster, as he manages to steal accounts under her and everybody else's nose by holding wild parties for the prospective clients. In an effort to pacify an ambitious model who wants to become a TV star, he shoots her in commercials for VIP, a product that doesn't exist.<br /><br />Through the incompetence of his nominal boss Pete Ramsey, the commercials hit the airwaves, which force Jerry to recruit reclusive scientist Linus Tyler to invent a product for VIP. In her effort to steal the VIP account from Jerry, Carol mistakes Jerry for Linus, and the rest becomes inevitable. Since Shapiro also co-wrote [[ASIN:B0001CNRC0 Pillow Talk]], this one gets even more far-fetched, but its lightning-quick pace, plethora of sexual double-entendres, constant tweaking of Madison Avenue ad agencies and a wildly improbable ending make it a funnier movie. Both Day and Hudson show themselves to be expert at this type of formulaic romantic comedy, and perennial third-wheel Tony Randall plays Ramsey with his trademark boastful befuddlement. The 2004 DVD contains only the original theatrical trailer as an extra.lays Ramsey with his trademark boastful befuddlement. The 2004 DVD contains only the original theatrical trailer as an extra.

0070511136|4.0|This book is a simple guide to improve your effectiveness as a sales professional in high-value direct enterprise sales situations. Regardless of culture and language, people on the other side of the table from a sales person have an instinctive judgment to mis-trust any characteristic that seems contrived or unnatural. Genuineness is a pre-requisite. Therefore, like with any sales theory, rote learning and implementation of the theory is futile. Having said that, internalizing the fundamental premise of this book in my everyday life as a sales-person has been rewarding over the years and across geographies, cultures, languages and types of product/service being sold.<br /><br />SPIN selling goes well with approaches that talk about [[ASIN:1887006001 Values-Based Selling]], [[ASIN:0786303158 Solution Selling]] and Rackham's own [[ASIN:0070511144 Major Account Sales Strategy]].<br /><br />Huthwaite (Rackham) has done a phenomenal job of monetizing this simple concept by way of selling sales training and books. However, you may find the book too \\"salesy\\" at times. It is common idiom with any good speech, presentation or book; first you tell them what you are going to tell them, then you tell them, then you tell them what you told them. The book does a great job of steps 1 and 3, but leaves you wanting more in step 2.<br /><br />The basic concepts about stages of a sales call, focus on customer needs and benefits, situation-problem-implication-need-payoff line of questioning, objection handling/prevention, sound closing techniques and post-sales are well articulated. The promise of increasing effectiveness in \\"major sales\\" is largely fulfilled. However, the emphasis on \\"it's based on research\\" goes unsubstantiated for the most part. You find the author insisting that \\"it's based on research\\" and providing simplistic graphs \\"based on research\\" than actually providing rigorous insights into the research. It also does not help that business theory is presented as a first person narrative. Blurs that fine line between theory-based opinion and opinion-based theory.<br /><br />All said, the technique is highly effective and serves as a great foundation for approaching sales calls at various stages in the cycle. I've found myself going back to this book multiple times over the years. Always a good sign for books that you want to own rather than just read once.that fine line between theory-based opinion and opinion-based theory.

B0000AK7AA|4.0|I have just seen this movie.  The last time I saw it was when I was 13 years old (this was a long time ago).  I bought it out of a DVD bin for [...] dollars and decided to watch it again.    I wasn't disappointed.  I loved Cathy Moriarty as Carrigan, and Eric Idle as Dibs.  I thought that they were very funny as a duo.    I felt sorry for Casper when he lost his chance to live permanently as a human, but I understood why he did it.  Overall, there are a lot of emotional moments and laughs in the film.    If people are wondering what the rating on the movie is about - there are a few swears, and a few characters die and are re-animated, but that's about it.      I would recommend watching it.
B00003CWNR|4.0|This film is a geat, offbeat story placed in a very troubled time; spotlighting difficult decisions and the maturing process of the lead character. We really enjoyed the film. It was done very professionaly and probed the secrets of the characters in a sensitive manner. The film's location shots are beautiful.
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|I became aware of this movie by reading the rave review on Film Freak Central, and their interview with director Walter Murch. Murch was the editor of The Godfather, Apocalypse Now, Cold Mountain, and Jarhead, and this is his first and only film. Anyway, liking dark children's movies as I do, I thought it sounded very intriguing and thought I'd check it out.<br /><br />Now, my DVD player/surround sound system in a refurbished piece of crap, and sometimes the audio doesn't start right. So there I was, thinking this movie was really unusually prosaic, as all I was hearing was this beautiful, dreamy music, and no dialogue. It took me a while to realize that this was because my front speakers were not working, and I was just getting the music track on the rear speakers.<br /><br />All of this of course required me to restart my machine several times, and it's during those times that one becomes really annoyed at the useless video tags put on at the beginning of some DVDs that you cannot skip through. In this case, the interminable [10 second] graphic that informs me that I am watching a DVD. Oh, thank you so very much, but you know, I put the disc in myself, so am pretty much aware that I am watching a DVD! But we all know that Disney wastes no opportunity to let us all know how very magical every single aspect of watching a Disney film is.<br /><br />Thing is, this movie is about as far from fare one would associate with Disney as you can get. Adapted from two later books in the Oz series, this film takes place six months after the tornado that we saw in The Wizard of Oz. Now, while it's almost impossible to watch this film free of the influence of the other one, this movie immediately asserts its differences. For one, Dorothy is YOUNG. She's 10 at the very most, and this both gives a better context to the entire thing and makes more sense of the idea of her inventing this fantasy world. Another difference is that her life on the farm is portrayed here as much more rural and true to life, as this film was shot in real locations and not entirely in the studio. The third aspect is that this film is MUCH more dark, which is apparently closer to the tone of the actual books, which are akin to Grimm fairy tales.<br /><br />It would seem that since the tornado, Dorothy, played here by the charming and adorable Fairuza Balk, has been unable to sleep. Aunt Em, here played by Piper Laurie, is worried about her inability to sleep and her continual talk about Oz, which of course she doesn't believe in. This makes this movie close in theme to one of my other favorite childhoood movies, The Curse of the Cat People, also about a young girl whose parents want her to pull her head out of the fantasy world she's in. So she takes Dorothy to see a doctor who specializes in electroshock, and they plan to keep Dorothy with them overnight and run electricity through her brain. You will know that you are not in your father's Oz when you see Dorothy STRAPPED to a gurney and hooked up to an electroshock machine. At this time you will also notice the wonderfully witchy outfit worn by his assistant, Nurse Wilson, with these great shoulder things that stick straight up. You should be paying attention to all of these people and things, because, as in the first film, they will all be processed and appear in disguise once Dorothy enters Oz once more.<br /><br />You will also be aware that you are watching the work of someone who has been involved in movies for some time as you look at some of the beautiful compositions you see on screen.<br /><br />Anyway, a power outage causes the electroshock machine to fail, and Dorothy and a mysterious girl make a mad escape through a terrible storm from the institute. Dorothy is swept down a raging river, very intense and scary, and it is soon after that she washes up in Oz. Oh, by the way, all this time she's accompanied by this hen, an extremely poor substitute for Toto, who utters dialogue akin to the droid Keystone Kops Komedy from the end of Star Wars Episode II, the kind that makes you want to strike yourself repeatedly about the head with a mallet. Please remove all heavy objects from your environment before viewing.<br /><br />When Dorothy arrives in Oz we are greeted with another gorgeous shot of these wonderful trees, which she promptly settles under for a snack. During this time one sees that the ROCKS are watching her. It seems like a good idea to make rocks evil as... well, rocks SEEM evil, don't they? This is followed by a quite interesting scene of a rock speaking to his master, accomplished by stop-motion animating layers of clay to make it appear as though the crevices in the rock is forming a face as speaking. It is not realistic in any way, but one admires the craft and imagination required to accomplish this... and we're just getting started.<br /><br />Dorothy soon sees that the Emerald City now lies in ruins, and all of its inhabitants have been turned to stone, including the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion! [I told you it was dark!]. Dorothy sets about finding the scarecrow, and finding out what happened to her friends.<br /><br />Along the way she meets a jack o' lantern on a body of twigs [whose appearance in the novels I'm going to guess was the inspiration for Jack Skellington from The Nightmare Before Christmas], and a tubby robot.<br /><br />Soon what I find to be the freakiest scene in the movie happens, when Dorothy is taken in by a queen, who decides that she will lock the girl in a tower until she grows up, then appropriate her head. This woman takes Dorothy into a large chamber with walls lined with little glass chambers, each displaying a head on a pedestal. The heads are all alive, and their eyes silently stare at Dorothy [creepy] or follow the queen. The woman takes off her head and places it in one of these cases, and chooses another to wear. Later, Dorothy has to steal something out of one of the cases. The heads are all asleep. When Dorothy makes a slight noise, the head wakes up, and the entire hall of heads starts SCREAMING! This whole thing is horrifying and wonderful in the way of the best freaky children's tales, Alice in Wonderland being the best example.<br /><br />So it goes on with more adventures, and special effects that mix stop-motion animation, puppetry, animatronics--whatever can be used, and while not all of it is successful, it is all interesting and one admires the film for its imagination and gung-ho attitude in attempting to conjure all of these things to life. Now of course they would all be accomplished with CGI, and unless the very best director were behind it all, it would all be boring as hell.<br /><br />The ending becomes quite explosive, and peace is restored through a similar device to the first movie. This is added to similarities including a corollary but different group of companions through Oz, the natural calamity that brought Dorothy there in the first place, and the whole structure of the story, but these all make it part of a series rather than a tired retread.<br /><br />While it is a kids movie and while it is a Disney movie, this film is, I would think, more of interest to adults who enjoy tales of the dark side of childhood. There are scenes so terrifying they could easy go into a standard horror movie. Not all of it works, but the dizzying display of creativity and the brave attitude to just run with it all makes this a very satisfying watch.the kind that makes you want to strike yourself repeatedly about the head with a mallet.

B000LE1GVW|3.0|Love the New Shoes song, but the others are a bit slower and sound a little like Jeff Buckley.  Not a bad thing, just not as upbeat as what I had expected.  Good CD though.
B000N3AWDE|4.0|The new French album from Celine Dion, D'Elles, is nowhere near as good as D'eux or some of her other earlier albums, but it is still a lot of fun with great tracks. The first 3 tracks are the ones most likely to be released (the first 2 have already been released as singles) with the third song, A cause, being my favorite. It's very rock and rolly, has great notes for Celine to hit, and in general, is fun to listen and sing along to. The rest of the CD has some other nice songs to sing along with but I don't think the material adds up to the greatness of D'eux. This CD is still a must-have for Celine fans such as myself, but for others I would try the tracks before I buy just to make sure that it's up your alley.
0743496728|5.0|I have liked other books by Picoult, but this one is head and shoulders above the usual, with multiple characters, shifting time sequences, and expert plotting.  A bullied boy, Peter Houghton, takes guns to school one day and kills 10 classmates - a topic that could have been cliché, but not in Picoult's telling.  One particular classmate, Josie Cormier, is spared, but has no memory of the event, and her mother Alex is the court judge who will preside over the case. Along the way, we come to know Peter and Josie and both of their mothers, along with the detective in charge and the lawyer who takes on Peter's defense. Picoult has a firm grasp on what being popular means (and costs) to young people, and she understands how fierce a mother's love can be when a child closes off communication or even becomes an unrecognizable version of his former self.  This story and its characters stayed with me for days after finishing it.
0739308688|4.0|This audiobook is worth listening to, but the narrator detracts from its potential. Mr. Dotrice sounds too old. His gravelly voice does not allow for adequate differentiation when young or female characters speak. His diction is not what I expected and he seems to run out of breath in the middle of sentences or phrases. While Mr. Dotrice may be ideal for something with a smaller number of mostly male characters, he was unfairly cast for this book, to both his detriment and the story's. I still recommend the audiobook, but lament the lost potential. Perhaps I'll just read the hardcopy a fourth time.

B00000GUZP|5.0|I loved this album from the day I bought it. Yes, the vinyl. One can appreciate art work on an album as opposed to a cd which just shrinks everything and takes the intensity out of it (but I loved this album so much, that I bought the CD version when it was released!).As a matter of fact, I purchased a record album frame and have Debbie on my wall amungst other really great album covers (i.e., The B-52's \\"Whammy!\\" and Klaus Nomi \\"Encore!\\")    The thing I love most about this album is the fact that it looks, sounds and feels like a Debbie Harry effort, NOT Blondie. I'm so tired of fans and critics comparing solo artists to the group they come from (Ric Ocasek of the Cars, Bjork of the Sugarcubes, Marc Almond of Soft Cell, etc.) What people seem to forget is that when an artist breaks away from their group to do some solo work, it's exactly that--solo work. It's 100% of the solo artist as opposed to the smaller % they contribute while in their group.     Every track on 'KooKoo' is remarkable. From the opener \\"Jump Jump\\" to the closing \\"Oasis\\" (on the CD it closes with the dance version of \\"Backfired\\"-fabulously extended I might add), this album is a non-stop absolutely fabulous funky good time complete with harry/stein/chic driven forces.    It was happening in 1981 and it's still happening 26 years later. Kudos to Debbie!
B00005JODM|4.0|Delightfully corny with a charming look that boasts the razzle-dazzle style of Hollywood musicals from a bygone era, Hairspray could be the most fantastic Broadway adaptation since Grease. The surprisingly exciting picture won't just keep your hair in a flashy do, it will hold audiences attention from the first note of its energetic opening song, \\"Good Morning Baltimore\\" right through its whiz bang finale.<br /><br />Based on the John Waters' 1988 film turned Broadway musical, the 2007 adaptation of Hairspray may not be as politically charged as its predecessor, but the reaffirmation of today's cultural values, plus a campy look at an era of lost innocence, should enchant audiences into falling in love with the material all over again. Captivated by the Corny Collins Show, a sixties dance program on a local Baltimore television channel, young Tracy Turnblad (Niki Blonsky) spends her hours keeping her perfect hairdo at attention while daydreaming of dancing on the television program and winning over one of the show's hunkiest young stars. Despite the disapproval of her mother Edna, played by superstar John Travolta in drag, Tracy's father, Wilbur (Christopher Walken), encourages his daughter to audition for the show, because in America after all \\"you have got to think big to be big\\".<br /><br />And big is exactly how to describe Hairspray. The gorgeous, pastel colored back lot sets are big, the dance numbers are big, and even Travolta's fat suit is big! Sans the wailing divas and in your face editing of past Oscar worthy musicals, Hairspray follows its daring lead character in celebrating being different. Director-Choreographer Adam Shankman approaches Hairspray with the appreciation of a veteran Broadway performer, showcasing the grand spectacle of it all instead of trying to overwhelm audiences with flashy and gimmicky editing tricks. Though his surprisingly formulaic style failed in his previous directorial efforts like The Pacifier and Cheaper by the Dozen 2, Shankman seems to be at home with a period piece set in 1962, recreating a feel from Hollywood's golden era.<br /><br />Unlike The Producers, another recent picture adapted from a musical originally based on a film, the witty screenplay penned by Leslie Dixon, brings out the director and casts' comedic timing and skill, giving Hairspray some big laughs. While the romantic pairing of Travolta and an underused Christopher Walken is uproarious, it disappointingly caters to cheeky humor that is funny for nothing more than the fact that one of the famous actors is in drag.<br /><br />Luckily the young talent that populates most of the film is absolutely delightful. Amanda Bynes, Elijah Kelley and Zac Efron all deliver solid and entertaining performances, but the real find in Hairspray comes in the form of the pleasantly plump, yet undeniably adorable Nikki Blonsky. Working in Cold Stone Creamery merely one year ago, the unknown actress with no experience besides a handful of high school musicals explodes on screen in Hairspray with a memorable debut performance that should finally steal some thunder away from last year's sluggish Dreamgirls.<br /><br />With old Hollywood charm and flair Hairspray should delight audiences across the country with its quirky style and laughable medleys reaffirming that being different is a good thing. With enough subtle raunchiness to please fans of the John Water's original, plus big performances and spectacularly fun dance numbers that should cater to Broadway aficionados, Hairspray should be just the product theaters need to get that extra pouf in their summer box office sales.<br /><br />-Joe Russoe at home with a period piece set in 1962, recreating a feel from Hollywood's golden era.

B000Q76K24|3.0|This movie is very long clocking in at around 2hr 45min.  There are several section that could have easily been made shorter.  This coupled with the fantastic (but sometimes underutilized) cast makes this movie reek of a vanity project.    But it is good.  There are several unexpected twists and turns.  The performances are solid.  How or why they made Martina Gedeck look like a frumpy housefrau I have no idea.
B00005JP5P|3.0|Danny Boyle's latest foray into full-blown science fiction, Sunshine, lingers in the realm of horror at the most inappropriate times, and stifles the excitement at equally inopportune moments. Undoubtedly suspenseful, but with frenetic editing oftentimes replacing important scenes that shouldn't be so abstract, Sunshine may find itself fading all too quickly amongst the dregs of the genre. Amazing special effects and stunning visuals propel it to the top of the list of potential blockbusters, but mainstream audiences may be discouraged too quickly by the confused blend of themes and the uncertain motives behind Boyle's storyline decisions.<br /><br />In the future, the earth has been thrown into a nuclear winter from the sun's rapidly dying state. A group of scientists and astronauts aboard the Icarus Two are on a last ditch attempt to re-ignite the sun with a massive bomb - a mission that was failed by the previous team seven years earlier. When a distress signal from the Icarus One is picked up and the decision is made to intercept and investigate, tensions rise from critical calculation errors and dissension among the ranks. After a mysterious accident hinders the mission's progress and forces the crew to re-evaluate their situation, things take a turn for the worse as it appears someone or something doesn't want the operation to succeed.<br /><br />The beginning of Sunshine introduces unique and interesting characters, and their immediate development ensures that these will not be the static and forgettable lot from Michael Bay's Armageddon, which features a similarly unlikely plot and stereotypical heroes. But in the distant future, the crew of the Icarus is faced with the bleakness of unforgiving and lonely solitude from mankind, which has bestowed on these heroes the mission to save the world. A few early shots which weave through shadowy corridors and dance about dimly lit Giger-esque passageways immediately foreshadow ominous events. But the alarming intensity Boyle borrows from Ridley Scott's Alien is soon to be abandoned, as an overwhelming theme of self-sacrifice quickly permeates the ill-fated vessel. It keeps up quite adequately initially, with the crew continually faced with problems that insist upon sacrificing lives or weighing detrimental options. It is here that the character development and acting really grips the audience, with crew members greedily valuing their own lives above the betterment of humanity, or boldly volunteering for horribly suicidal missions. Chris Evans' Mace is perhaps the most influential and remarkable character of the crew, due to his unflinching dedication to the mission, which often leads to the realization that they are the last resort, last hope and final attempt at saving Earth. Cassie (Rose Byrne) displays the most relatable human qualities, refusing to give in to the idea that any one soul is less important than the entirety of humanity. Cillian Murphy's Capa is clearly the lead, but despite his powerful performance, oftentimes steps aside for the supporting casts' notable moments.<br /><br />Midway through the film, Boyle peaks with white-knuckle suspense and tear-jerker moments as his hapless crew is bombarded with issues of rapidly depleting oxygen, destruction to necessary ship components, and prioritizing the crew in the event that only a \\"lucky\\" few may see the mission through to its completion. When the decision is made to board Icarus One, the original ship sent some decade earlier, which was a supposed total failure, the eerie horror elements begin to take shape. Not a primitive form of scare tactics, but an inventive splicing of subliminal images, the editing warns of lingering atrocities that may still lurk in the lightless regions of the desolate craft. The creepiness remains, but is sadly underdeveloped, and gives way to obvious horror techniques that feel remarkably stereotypical. The sacrifices of the crew, the fear of death and the fear of failure all take a back seat to an outlandish nemesis that washes away the initial impressiveness of the already farfetched premise.<br /><br />As unbelievable as Boyle's plot appears, we are so perfectly soaked in its plausibility, from the characters, their emotions, and the situations that befall them. But like many of the quickly forgotten stabs at the vast science fiction genre, Sunshine introduces elements of shock that jarringly awake us from our comfortable suspension of disbelief and remove us from our sympathies for the protagonists. It becomes a game of who stays alive until the conclusion, instead of whether or not the mission succeeds. And the conclusion, possibly adding to the throwbacks to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey with abstract images, corybantic editing and the computer that controls the well-being of the ship (with an appealing woman's voice), is too bizarre and unclear, leading to general dissatisfaction.<br /><br />Sunshine had plenty of potential, namely because the things that should have happened most certainly could have (although Boyle chose other routes), and is a welcome addition to 2007's lack of serious and mature science fiction. Ultimately, however, Boyle's latest film never really knows what it wants to be. The acting truly shines and brilliantly realized characters help to counteract the spiraling storyline. Such involving personas keep the suspense high and the ennui low, but even state-of-the-art special effects and inventive editing can't quite keep the light burning bright enough when the film flickers into the heavily treaded horror genre and the realm of disbelief. Questionable denouement direction aside, Sunshine still remains an engaging sci-fi thriller with plenty of hard-hitting action and scares, but like looking directly into the sun for too long, the lasting impression that it leaves might just blur amongst the rest of the genre's misadventures.<br /><br />- Mike and Joel Massiesh nemesis that washes away the initial impressiveness of the already farfetched premise.

B000S0DDG0|2.0|There are some really nice things about the film- the cast, the wardrobe, the music.  However, there wasn't much else.  I ended up fast forwarding through most of it because I was so bored.
B00005A1VH|5.0|I recently had visited the north-eastern part of Tennessee were Sargent York was from. We went by his homestead and gravesite in Pall Mall, TN. and I was telling my family his story-None of them had heard of it. So when we returned I ordered the movie. We all sat down and watched it together. Everyone loved it.  It was so nice to quickly find the movie I wanted and it was to me in less than a week. the cost was inexpensive and the Video -like new.  I continue to be a devoted Amazon fan and customer.  Sincerely Donna McKnight
B000002I6X|4.0|. . . but a very good one nevertheless.  \\"Change Partners\\" has proved to be a very durable song.  \\"Fishes and Scorpions\\" is a nice acoustic number.  The reason why I originally purchased the LP back in 1971, though, is the neglected single, \\"Marianne\\"--a highly enjoyeable, if somewhat slight, rocker, with Stills in the upper reaches of his vocal range.  Despite the sometimes unwieldy arrangements, this is a very good set of Stills songs.
B000MV9026|3.0|The movie is cute enough and thankfully kept the attention of my kids for almost the full two hours.  But I am so tired of movies that preach to me -- and this movie is one of the preachiest I've seen in a while.  Yes, ALL humans are evil and destroying our environment even as we speak....  Ugh!
B000P0J024|5.0|This collection of the Traveling Wilburys' entire catalog is a welcome addition to the spate of reissues of the CD era, and although, sadly, Roy Orbison and George Harrison aren't around to enjoy it, the other three (Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne) are still around, making great music, and advocating sanctions on Indonesia in retaliation for that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist and community-service requirements for high-school graduation. \\"Handle With Care\\", originally intended as a Harrison B-side, is one of pop's great singles, whereas \\"End Of The Line\\" is a warning against throwing off one's contentment that inspired my opposition to a federal shield law for journalists. This is a great anthology that belongs in any pop or rock collection.
0783225849|1.0|Need I say more?  This 5-star movie on the Universal DVD is shown in \\"widescreen\\" format, but framed within a 4:3 viewing ratio.  Which means you get black bars on the top and bottom, AND left and right.  Which doesn't look like what you expect to see with any other movie on your widescreen TV.  Do you get it?  So, my conclusion is that Universal Home Video has really screwed up on the Hitchcock films they control.  From the botched \\"restoration\\" on Rear Window (it's too fuzzy), to the goofy foley effects re-recorded for Vertigo, and now this insult to movie buffs (similar to BBC video's that keep their widescreen content firmly fixed in the 4:3 frame).<br /><br />Paramount, on the other hand, got it right with their latest issue of \\"To Catch A Thief\\" with a clean sharp print, preserving the original VistaVision aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (as anamorphic widescreen).<br /><br />I don't know why so many of the classic Hitchcock films are getting such bad treatment, with films such as \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Spellbound\\" remaining currently unavailable (check out the used prices to see how valuable these films really are).  What I have seen from Criterion are only partially restored, and not digitized and cleaned up as current restoration efforts can accomplish.<br /><br />I'm passing on any more Hitchcock DVD's from Universal, unless I have some confidence that the re-issues are done with some real attention to the quality of the release, as Paramount has done with their later releases.
031286504X|5.0|This book was the best book I have read in a long time. It was short, but very very worth it. His writing style and vocabulary are top notch and this book keeps you glued to your seat for the whole thing. There is no way you can read this book in small bites. It's just too good. Best vampire story I have ever read. Can't wait for the movie now and I hope they make it exactly like that book.
B00004RF98|5.0|I saw this movie when it was released orignally in Radio City Music Hall.  In fact I went back and saw it twice more.  To me it is the best muscial ever put onto film.  It is my favorite musical film which I never tire of watching.  I watch it a minimum of 6 times a year.  The entire film is magical and so wonderful that I can't resist screening it over and over.  I know all the songs by heart and sing along with them when alone and if with someone else in the room I mouth the words.  I always knew it was a great film but never realized how many other people cherished it as well.  The music is toe tapping and melodic.  The message of the film is pure fun.  If someone doesn't like this film they really must be a grinch.  Fred in NJ
006085880X|4.0|I love this novel by Jodi Picoult.  It's an emotional and intriguing story of the lives of two very close families.  I read this book in 3 days.  It was so hard to put down.  I'd recommend it!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|We really liked the movie and were moved by the songs and the chemistry between the two leads.  We especially liked about the first 7 or 8 songs.  I'd recommend seeing the movie to really appreciate the music.
B000P0I4OY|4.0|I'm a big fan of Morgan Freeman anyway, and his typically first-class performance was in evidence in The Contract. This movie hits on all four cylinders:  Great acting, great script, good directing and beautiful scenery. There were some sub-plots that deserved more direction and development and I saw a couple minor plot holes but that aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Another plus is that it wasn't as horrifically graphic as many of this genre typically are. Yeah, people get shot and things explode, but it's not too awful (compared to typical hollywood horror).<br /><br />Bad-guy Morgan Freeman explains to an inquiring teen what he does for a living. He explains that he's a professional assassin and \\"removes obstacles\\" to help advance governmentally-ordered progress. When asked further about his moral code, Morgan Freeman responded, \\"There are things I wouldn't do. I have my limits. I just haven't found them yet.\\"<br /><br />I don't have the time to watch a lot of movies so I'm pretty discerning about how I kill two hours of time, but The Contract was a worthy flick. I may even watch it a second time.
0307276902|1.0|I wish I could get back the time I spent reading what I did of this book. I have worked in mental health & this book does not seem real.  This is about the 5th review I have written - let's see if Amazon will have the guts to post it.  Amazon has discarded all my previous reviews.  But the word needs to get out there about this book. don't waste your time or money on it.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I don't own the album, but if Never Again is a preview of what is to become of Kelly Clarkson and her music, I say go girl -- it's a bit edgier than her other music.  The song kind of reminds me of something along the lines of Pat Benatar -- and we all loved Pat Benatar!      You go Kelly!
B000P2A24W|5.0|With their hit single \\"I Wanna Make a Memory,\\" this album didn't dissapoint! I got it for my birthday and it was exactly what I wanted. Other favorite tracks include the first few. I can't recommend it enough!! While it does have more of a country sound than their other albums, it grows on you!!
B000NQRV4O|5.0|The transfer is amazing and really spotlights just how good this Hi Definition format is.
B00079FUI6|5.0|Loved the series...I feel so much more informed and ready for next season. All the DVD's were in great condition.
B000008HPE|5.0|FORE! is another fantastic Huey Lewis & the News album.  In this album you will get a bit more of the blues affect.  Now I'm not a blues fan but when I hear this it's hard to turn it off.  \\"Stuck with You\\" is one of my favorites from this album.  It reminds me of when I was four and five years old again!  \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" is fantastic, as well as \\"I know what I Like\\", \\"I Never Walk Alone\\", \\"Forest for the Trees\\", and \\"Simple as That\\".  The rest of the album, along with the songs I've mentioned, is very catchy and fun to listen to.  \\"Doing It All for my Baby\\" is another fantastic song from the album.  \\"Hip to be Square\\" is fantastic as well.  If you're a Huey Lewis & the News fan, or if you just like good music, then you need to pick this one up.  It's a keeper!
B000M06K5C|4.0|I am a huge fan of Bloc Party, and ever since I discovered them, I have loved listening to their music.  Their first debut, Silent Alarm, is an excellent album, and I kept that in mind when I purchased thier follow up album, A Weekend in the City.  I must say that I was disappointed at first, mainly because A Weekend in the City is not the same as Silent Alarm.  I was expecting the same catchy hooks, bouncy rhythms, and light pop rock sound.  Bloc Party's second album is not the same as their first.  I definitely applaud them for trying to maintain innovation, and not always play the same thing.  Just recently I have started to listen to A Weekend in the City more often, and the more I listen to it, the more it grows on me.  AWitC is darker, edgier, and plays with a raw, uneven sound.  Even still, I think it is a good album that solid Bloc Party fans should invest in, or any lover of alt rock.  \\"The Prayer\\" is the catchy hook song of the album, while \\"Hunting for Witches\\" has a neat and inventive sound.  \\"I Still Remember\\" has traces of Silent Alarm's \\"Blue Light\\" in that it is mellow, melodic, and beautiful.  I look forward to Bloc Party's next release, whenever it may come, and suggest going for AWitC.  This album grows on you, and is really different than Silent Alarm.  Change is good.

B000001DU5|4.0|the 12 cuts included in this greatest hits compilation released some 15 years ago are still great, and never loses its charm to old and new listeners, fans or non-fans alike.<br /><br />with the initial wave of hits coming from \\"the hurting\\" the group went on to record their era-defining album in 1984 with \\"songs from the big chair\\" which (un)fortunately gave them worldwide recognition, number 1 hits, and international awards. the group has deinitely arrived.<br /><br />however, in 1989, with high expectations generated by their second album, \\"the seeds of love\\" - their last album for the decade, was not able to generate the same euphoria as did the first two albums.<br /><br />inevitably separating in 1993, roland orzabal and curt smith went on solo directions, with roland retaining the group's name. (between the two solo albums, i can say that it is curt's album that sounded better, as i am reminded of TFF's sound.)<br /><br />for this greatest hits album, it seemed lacking in some tracks as it only included all the commercial hits and was not even arranged chronologically, not even digitally remastered.<br /><br />the album could have included a few more hits such as the hurting, the working hour or badman's song.<br /><br />whatever may have happened to TFF (they reunited two years ago with \\"everybody loves a happy ending\\") they were able to define an era with their music.<br /><br />and until now, fans could not get enough of the group's released collections. for initiates, catch TFF much more by acquiring the following: the hurting (1999 remastered), songs from the big chair (1999 remastered), the seeds of love (1999 remastered), saturnine, martial and lunatic (1999), elemental (roland solo, 1993), soul on board (curt's solo album, 1993) and the deluxe limited edition of \\"songs from the big chair\\" for all the remixes, rarities and other goodies you need.
B000A2XC1C|5.0|I love this movie and have ever since I was a child.  It brings back the whole story of Santa claus and for children it makes them believe in Santa.  You can't go wrong with this show.
B000H6SXLU|5.0|OK so Irene Dunne is the star. Well she was a bigger, established cinema icon than newcomers Astaire and Rogers. But who really cares? This is an enjoyable movie based on the hit play. Sit back and enjoy the high stepping that would forever immortalize the team of Astaire & Rogers and singing the wonderful songs by the great American composers. They get their just screen time and went on to star in their own vehicles. Irene does the definitive version of the classic SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES with her silken honey soprano and no one can top her.<br /><br />The story is a bit stagy and true, some of the brighter moments belong to Fred and Ginger. This is mainly because Randolph Scott who makes a dashing leading man is completely out of place as Dunne's love interest in this film.<br /><br />Sit back, zip the lip and be thankful this classic is available on pristine DVD! Want more, buy the Astaire's/Roger's box set which includes this early outing for them.<br /><br />Amen.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This movie is also a classic great for the entire family.  It can change an Adult into a kid and make a kid into a great Adult.  It places values on family that lack in the upbringing in moral fiber these days and teaches values that a nanny rarely teaches our current children of today with the exception of hola due to parents working there children's lives away in pursuit of money and Capitalism.  So please sit down with your own family and cherish feeding the birds or going to fly a kite or spending time with them before time spends you.
0743454537|5.0|This is a great book. I couldn't put it down. I felt the struggle and pain of all of the characters involved.

B000002HJR|4.0|This is a great cd if you like true southern rock.  Great group of members in the band.  Just a great cd to own.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Its a true story that inspires me every time and also a classic for the entire family.  This story talks of history, life, values, love, tragic times, and that good people do have a choice to oppose evil in the pursuit of  something very worthwhile, which is family.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|Since I was a kid I loved this movie, the best villains (Lord Humungus), coolest car chase scenes ever, and the movie is down right raw...  And now on Blu-Ray, things couldn't be better.  Except for some more extra features and stuff, but all in all, 2 thumbs up.
9626343346|5.0|As he does with all of his readings of Holmes, David Timson conveys a richness that is not to be surpassed. I used to think that Jeremy Brett playing Holmes in the PBS TV series was the best media representation out there. After to listening many times over to Mr. Timson's renderings, I no longer have no desire to see the video version. The Naxos Holmes series is a real standout in the world of audio books.

1594489505|5.0|I found myself reveling in, and sponging up, each and every page.  As I found myself drawing closer to the end, I had to limit my reading to one page per day so the experience of reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" would last that much longer.  That's how much I loved this book!    I never dreamed this book would have such a huge effect on me, but the story grabbed me right from the start.  I found myself in a catch-22 situation because I was drawn to reading it, yet I hated the thought of it coming to an end.    The writing is brilliant, believable, and done in such a way that it makes you feel as though you are experiencing each and every event just as much as if you were the actual person written as the character.  I've yet to experience writing quite like this.     I've been searching all year for a \\"GREAT\\" and \\"unique\\" book to present to the women in the book club I belong to, and I felt as though I was never going to find such a book.  But one day, while reading the \\"New Yorker\\" magazine, I saw a book review regarding this particular book.  I went straight to the Amazon website to see what ratings this book had received and after reading the multiple comments and excerpts, I decided to order it and give it a whirl.      I'm happy to report that this is \\"THE\\" book I've been searching for!  I'm excited to introduce this masterpiece to the women who'll be attending book club in September, and I can't wait to hear the discussions this book is going to generate, as I know there will be lots for us women to talk about.  After all, the name of our book club is \\"Chatter Matters,\\" and I can't think of a more appropriate book to chatter about than \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns!\\"    Julie Weaver
B00005RG6B|5.0|I first purchased Operation Mindcrime (the album) in 1988 when I was 12 years old.  I got the VHS version of Operation Livecrime on its release.  I have watched it over 100 times since then.  I find myself at work, now 31 years old, still listening to the Operation Livecrime CD.  The first couple of times I watched it, as a 12 year old, I thought some of the dramatics were unwarranted, but I enjoyed the VHS nonetheless.      Since then I have grown to love this VHS and CD unconditionally.  Some of the other reviewers haven't enjoyed some of the dramatics, but I'm to the point where I feel the dramatics are part of this Album's charm.    Practically perfect technically and masters of songwriting, I think I will be watching this concert and listening to the CD well into my 60s.
1594489505|5.0|I've read thousands of books. Sometimes as many as five a week. When I read Hosseini's first book, The Kite Runner, I proclaimed it was the best book I ever read. I finished A Thousand Splendid Suns in the wee hours of last night. Toward the end I had to work to keep my eyes open. It didn't matter how tired I was, I needed to finish. I needed to know what happened to the people I had come to love through the pages. Hosseini writes so beautifully, but he does it by showing the blemished, the earthy, the real. Many writers have something to learn from the way Hosseini writes. He is writing. I open his books and I find immense pleasure. Too, I find knowledge on his pages. All of the news reports about this part of the world couldn't even begin to educate me on the Middle East as well as Hosseini. Absolutly beautiful. A treasure indeed.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|Music, rhythm, soul and heart.  This characterizes this concert that anyone at any age will enjoy.  I believe Yanni invented a new music category, global music.  No matter who you are or where you live, it's the right the stuff that anybody will take pleasure in, no matter in what state of mind they are.  It's just that great.
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I admit to being a relatively die hard Paul Simon fan.  It is not a blind adoration, however - like any of us, the man has his ups and downs.  His two most recent albums really for me do not live up to the meditative, empathic radience of some of his previous work.    Maybe its unfair to judge any of his work against the standard of this album, The Rhythm of the Saints.  Maybe its unfair to set ANY album, by anyone, against it in comparison.    I've had this album since it first came out in 1990.  I bought it on vinyl then and just bought it again on CD.  As familiar as it is to me, after 17 years of listening to it, it does not stale.  His words build up a structure for whatever meaning you need to impart to them - and the structure resolves them into a whole.  Every time I listen I learn something new.  He offers an ageless sympathy to his listeners, speaking with a voice of aeons of struggling souls is songs such as \\"Further to Fly\\" and \\"Spirit Voices\\" - but unlike most music and poetry of the day, reflecting on the pain leaves you with a wellspring of hope.       When Paul Simon goes to a new place, South Africa for Graceland, or South America for The Rhythm of the Saints, he becomes like an electrical conductor.  He is able to drop all the specific angst of his own life (unlike in his most recent album, in which we are forced to sympathise with his doing 500 sit ups a day, and dying his hair the colour of mud)and he channels the deepest, most timeless, most inherent and meaningful reaches of the human experience.       I don't mean to critisize his new work - the poor man has a right to settle down, be a father, a husband, a man.  But when he steps out of himself, as he has in this album, he steps into the most resounding depths of the ocean of humanity - (I know it sounds like I'm going overboard - but I promise, I give the man nothing he doesn't deserve.  I do not pretend that he is very good to watch in concert, that thing he does with his arm drives me crazy, and I suspect it is only with the greatest of technical assistance that he can keep his pitch - he is often inclined to stray quite off-tume, and his meandering vocalisations in concert make me tired.)      Listening to this album reminds me, at least, of being a part of a greater community - a moment in time, a beating heart in a great chorus of painful, hopeful, joyous rhythms - soaring with the rhythms of the saints.

B000OQF6N6|2.0|I tried. I really tried to give this album a chance. Even after I heard the single \\"Tarantuala\\" after it was leaked on the interwebs. I actually happened to love Machina and Ava Adore, both were different than what they did before, but were awesome albums. Every song on this album is garbage, save \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\". The 10 minute ode to politics is also a 10 minute waste of time, as the song fails to build any sort of momentum in that ten minutes, all the while stuff some whiny 40 year olds' backwards view of politics down your throat.<br /><br /> Why Corgan decided to jump into politics is beyond me, as any time a band does so pretty much alienates half their user base. Again, since it's standard procedure for \\"hip\\" bands to bash the current adminstration, the war, love on global warming, etc, there's nothing really \\"daring\\" or \\"different\\" about the whole tirade. Wouldn't it be completely off the wall different for a band to actually talk good about the country that they sit and make millions of dollars off of? Wouldn't that crazy? I get so sick of bands like green day, a perfect circle and now the smashingh pumpkins crapping on a country that made them millionaires, talking crap about our \\"capitalist society\\" all the while cashing those million dollar checks from the \\"limited edition bonus pack with art book\\" that they put out a hundred different versions of.<br /><br />Granted I haven't reviewed much of the album, but that in itself is another reason for my tirade, it's just bland garbage. There's nothing different or unique about the entire set of songs. They all sort of blend into each other. All the singles are absolute garbage, a bland boring mush of noise that never really builds into anything special like most of their older stuff did. Gone is the nice packaging and delicate care that was taken to create the previous releases, replaced with something cold and uninspired.<br /><br />It's ashame that after 7 years, this is what we get. Maybe their next \\"reunion\\" they can get back to the good ole days of what made them one of the best bands out there.back to the good ole days of what made them one of the best bands out there.
0743289684|5.0|Breathtaking.  Stunning.  What a pure story and what amazing power to write clearly.  She is now one of my hero's walking.  I just finished reading Robert Ingersoll's \\"Liberty of Man, Woman and Child\\" on  [...] then I picked up Ali's book.  What a gift. What a gift.    I read many post and almost every one has an angry male post (in some cases openly admitting to being muslim and in some cases the name is a clue).  Please ignore these posts.  Check your facts.  Ali lied to get into the country but as soon as she \\"shakes the cloak\\" of religion she STOPS lying.  Interesting.  I can here the \\"if she lied once\\" argument coming now.  This woman is heartbreakingly honest and level headed.  Read the book.
B000EK76K8|4.0|I thought that I would be clever and get the DVI adapter for DVI output, and also analog VGA, by using a DVI to VGA adapter.  No dice.  The Apple DVI adapter won't let you do that.  I should have done more research, but it was cheap, and it works fine for DVI applications.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I sat down to watch this show the first time thinking \\"a space western how lame is that?\\" and then I feel in love. Later when Serenity came out I forced my boyfriend to go with me to see it. Though he didnt get all the little behind the phrases jokes he enjoyed the movie and bought me the series on DVD. After watching the entire series he too feel in love with the show and shares in my sadness that it was canceled unjustly.
0393061310|5.0|Diamond has created a theory in which the reasons for the rise of Western European society and its world dominance are explained.  It is one of those books where you look at the arguements presented and realize that it all fits.  One of the top five most influential books I have ever read.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Fleck's honest, gut-wrenching depiction of drug abuse and the oddly intimate relationship that forms between a Brooklyn teacher and his student has \\"indie classic\\" written all over it. Gosling is terrific as the idealistic young educator who has a confident, easygoing manner in the classroom, but whose addiction problem is beginning to affect his job performance, and most tragically, his friendship with Drey, played with a mix of sheepish charm and street-hardened intensity by Epps. Dan's spiral downward may be tough to understand, but Fleck's story never feels contrived. Smart and stridently unsentimental, \\"Half-Nelson\\" will get its grip on you.
006054094X|5.0|Knowing the fact that China had the most advanced civilization in the world throughout most of its history, and the fact that it was a long-lasting and continuous civilization, one has to believe that the Chinese were capable of sailing not just to North and South America, but around the globe.  We all know that Columbus was not truly the first European to arrive in the Americas, yet we hold on to the image of the three little ships making their perilous voyage as the definitive discovery in the history of the world.  We choose to ignore the truth and cling on to these idealistic images.  The Chinese were more than capable of accomplishing the feat, and Menzies has provided a wealth of evidence to support his conclusions.  In fact, he continues to search for more evidence and I truly hope that he writes a second book, or updates the first, containing the new information he has discovered.
B00005T30L|5.0|An inspired take on adolescent alienation and angst, Zwigoff's \\"Ghost World\\"--adapted from the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes--is a clever and quirky character piece. The three leads are great, but Ileanna Douglas almost steals the film as eccentric art teacher Roberta, who pushes Enid to realize her creative talents. Yes, \\"Ghost World\\" is funny, but there's also wisdom and heart behind the laughs.
