B001N1DPDE|4.0|If you need a knife to use for every other tool (hatchet, butcher knife, hammer, shovel, etc.) this is it. Other wise it is overkill. Heavy. Use a piece of old bike tire inner tuber to afix a 90 degree #2 phillips head screw driver and a 5/32 (i think) allen wrench to the sheath so you can tighten as necessary the handles (which are very wide) and sheath screws. Different grips would really help this knife. Is a nice piece of steel.

B0011NVCSO|5.0|I haven't compared this to the CD. But the mix and clarity is pleasing, the vinyl album definitely brings out the warmth of the music. This is a rather minimalist recording, and the album sounds natural and pleasing.   It doesn't say 180 gram, but the record feels substantial. Perhaps somebody out there with a tiny scale could weigh it. Hmm, what else would one measure in grams? If you do happen to weigh it, leave a reply.  My album included a digital download.  I had no problem retrieving the digital download. The MP3s sound good, although only 192Kbs. Obviously, the MP3 is meant for iPod listening.  Hope amazon.com doesn't censor me, but I did happen to buy this at a local record store in Greenwich Village while visiting last fall.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is way better then having to buy 101 banes sepratly instead you could just download 101 games in this one game

B0063GORYU|3.0|Love to play the game, but the ads abruptly interrupting is very annoying and frustrating. The game itself is addicting.

0446585025|2.0|I really enjoyed Ellen's other two books.  This one had sections that were really funny, but for the most part everything seemed forced.  It was a fast and easy read but even then I still felt as though I'd wasted my time.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I know other reviewers have said this same thing, but this was my first Stephen King book.  I am not a fan of the gore and blood and ultra strange story lines of the King of the past.  This book explored a journey into the past and having the ability to change the course of the future.  The premise behind the story is going into the past to stop JFK's assassination.  Unfortunately the past doesn't want to be changed and therefore will do everything and anything to keep the change from happening.  The story encompasses love, hate, trials and tribulations into making the preset change.  The only negative that I found was the length of the story.  There was content in the story that I felt could have been left out and not changed the outcome of the book.  This extra material often made it dry and difficult to continue on.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great! It keeps me on track by reminding me to read everyday. It keeps track of notes I make and lets me highlight verses that touch my heart.
1577314808|1.0|As one works through \\"The Power of Now\\",  a deep sense of dread washes over oneself as you realize the evil brilliance of its author. Here in its 250 pages one finds flowery (yet confused) language dressing up a world view that cleverly manages to instill the worst of organized religion in a way designed to be receptive to those who see themselves above ascribing to any given faith. The book, much like many religions, puts mankind on trial, focusing on the evil done by humanity and the tainted, dirtied soul of the unfaithful. It's a story we have heard before: the world is awash in soulless husks of mankind, wandering aimlessly and miserably to a dark and early grave. Life here is as it was for Hobbes: nasty, brutish, and short.  But, like all charlatans, the author would have you believe that you can cleanse your demons if only you bought into his particular flavor of cure. In this case, by focusing on the \\"Power of Now.\\" Here is a philosophical treatise that any college freshman experimenting with hallucinogens the first time can summarize thusly: time is an illusion, your ego is not your soul, free your mind by abandoning its critical faculties, and detach yourself from your emotions by resigning yourself to your situation in the present. The author manages to make sweeping, unfalsifiable statements without any evidence (the 5-item bibliography for citations is particularly charming), and continually attempts to claim both sides of an argument (If I resign to my fate, can I still make decisions and correct my situation? Yes, of course. If you think this is a contradiction you are clearly too dense to appreciate the brilliant insight the author is bestowing upon you.)  The style of prose is often one of questions and answers, where a rational skeptic is trying desperately to get the author to realize the ridiculousness of his psychobabble. I found myself screaming in my head to this poor strawman to run away as fast as he could before the author tells his flock the final step in their salvation is to drink this lovely batch of kool aide. My absolute favorite part of the book is a passage where the author points to ducks by a riverbed and their mindless, in-the-moment behavior as a shining example how to live \\"in the Now\\", their flapping wings dissipating negative energy. (I am not kidding.)   Truly, it takes the mind of a genius to sit down and profess in 250 pages that he has managed to tie together modern physics, philosophy, religion, and life itself all on his own through internal reflection and, most likely, Wikipedia. Either a genius, or someone the world would have been a whole lot better off had he had taken a few more illegal substances in his youth and left his profound insights inside a hazy smoke-filled drum circle.

B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I have absolutely no reason to know what the moon phase is, but I downloaded this app because of the Live Wallpaper function.<br /><br />I'm always looking for cool new wallpapers, and this one is definitely cool.

B005DF2QMC|1.0|Had to return, it ate our cassettes.   good idea that didn't work.  We were really hoping to get our music converted.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great series for anyone who is a fan of westerns or sci-fi.  Probably made better because it was cancelled in the first season instead of dragging on and losing its pep and storyline.  Discs contain plenty of interesting bonus material, particularly for already fans of the show.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a little childish...graphics are old school. but it def helps the time pass by. My 4 yr old loves it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like it because it is fun to earn coins and then you get to unlock all the game by buying them with the coins. it is like a challenge. it is fun but, some game flare really hard. it is an overall fun game.
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins has yet another hit on her hands with Hunger Games.  Once you get started reading it is really difficult, if not possible, to put the book down.  Great writing style and a storyline that is absolutely gripping from start to finish.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|starts off as a pretty nice. app. you write or draw and it waits and makes your writing smaller and fits it into the notes on the current line. first problem is I do not see auto correct or predictive typing. second issue is bigger. I want to be able to draw a picture with multiple colors. I don't see how to do this in handrite. also changing preset pens should be easier. everything else seems pretty good.  let's see a solid update!

B003ZSJ212|5.0|Writing this seems kind of pointless, since half the reviews here are based on people's opinions of the Star Wars saga and not actually the product at hand. Half of the reviews here are by people who haven't even purchased this, and obviously wouldn't in the first place. Those people should express their frustrations through the proper channels rather than completely destroy the rating of a product that delivers everything it advertises. The video quality is crisp, clear, and better than ever before. I love the things they've changed, especially with the new trilogy. A+ for the work done on Episode I to digitally remaster Yoda, and the bonus content is incredible. I'm grateful for being given the opportunity to purchase the entirety of my favorite saga of all time in such good quality and such a great price! Thumbs up for sure!
B000OJFV3S|4.0|Note: I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />This immensely poular series is interesting. I like historical dramas. However, my problem is that there's no historical summary prior to the series, as there is in The Borgias. A historical summary of past events leading up to what occurs in the series is most helpful, so I was somewhat lost as to who is who and who is doing what to who and why. That being said, this series is intriguing.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Quick and responsive, easy to use desktop solution. Love the sound support and the quality of the video/gaming stream is a lot better then I expected.
1439192812|1.0|In Dawkins' latest, he is going after a new demographic: positivists who enjoy cartoons.  I am kidding, I am sure he is hoping that positivists will use the book to pass their faith onto their children.  And yes I do mean faith because if philosophy has taught us anything over the past 350 years since the beginning of the enlightenment it is that all world views require faith.  However, apart from the pretty pictures there is nothing in this book that Dawkins has not said or written a dozen times. About the only thing magical about this book is how much money Dawkins will make from republishing his same old tired arguments. I give this one two stars for Dave McKean's great artwork and zero stars for Dawkins who offers us nothing original.  Happy reading.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I wish I had bought the electronic version. It would be a lot easier to simply delete it than having to put it physically through the shredder. I was expecting funny. Didn't get it. A lot of whining and silliness, but no laughs here. And not even an interesting story. If you don't believe me, borrow a copy and read the first 2 chapters. If you haven't slit your wrists or hanged yourself after that, then read the rest. Even buy a copy. You are masochistic and this is exactly what you wanted. Otherwise, give it back and try to forget it ever happened.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|The stock browser is not very versatile. Dolphin is. Tabs, bookmark method and speed dial are just intuitive. I like that Dolphin allows you to select the flash items to display, cutting down on the expense of downloading bandwidth-intensive ads. Java, javascript and flash all work as expected. Firefox comes in second to this browser because FF tends to crash more than occasionally for no apparent reason. Dolphin doesn't crash.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Update: Ever since I left the below review, the annoying movie trailers for Devil Inside stopped popping up. I don't know if it's a coincidence or what, but now the game plays just fine. Which is good, because based on the \\"test drives\\" I've done for other solitaire apps, this one is miles ahead of the competition.  If movie trailers start popping up again, this review will jump back down to one-star. They really are that bad. But without the invasive ads, it's pretty much the perfect solitaire app. I especially like the one-touch moves, rather than having to drag every card.  Original Review: This is an excellent solitaire app except for the trailers for Devil Inside. They keep popping up in the middle of gameplay, and when you close it, the web browser opens up with at least 5 (sometimes more) blank tabs. It's EXTREMELY annoying, and could be horrifying if a child is playing.  Could be five stars without the movie trailers. Instead, the invasive ads that literally take you away from your game right in the middle of playing a card make it a one-star. Hopefully this gets fixed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great app to kill time when you are doing nothing and its enetertating  the graphics need some help but other than that its pretty good
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the games a lot. I think they are really cool! I like how you can earn coins instead of having to hug them.
0312641893|5.0|Rising from the ashes of the globally devastating World War IV, mankind has rebuilt and reestablished cities, countries, and civilization.  Now over a century later, the Eastern Commonwealth finds itself ravaged from within by a plague that seems to have no cure and threatened from without by the promise of war with their Lunar neighbors.  The Lunars, the inhabitants of the moon, and the people of Earth have long been at odds with each other, as the Lunars are known to be users of \\"magic,\\" ruthlessly ambitious and notoriously cold-hearted.  But when the Lunar sovereign, Queen Levana, proposes a peace treaty that would ease tensions between Luna and Earth, Prince Kaito must consider whether or not it is in the best interest of his people to make such an agreement.  It is into this complex, highly political and troubled world that Meyer places her little cinder girl.<br /><br />In her heroine, Lihn Cinder, Meyer has achieved a fantastic balance between toughness and vulnerability that I really connected with.  With no memory of her past before the age of 11, Cinder is placed under the guardianship of Lihn Garan, and taken to live with he, his wife and their two young daughters.  But when Garan dies shortly after assuming custody of Cinder, Cinder is reduced to the status of servant, as Adri, Garan's wife, never wanted her in the first place.  Now sixteen, Cinder works as a mechanic at the New Beijing weekly market repairing damaged netscreens and household androids so that her stepmother and step-sisters can maintain the lifestyle to which they've become accustomed.  An orphan and a cyborg, her position within society is a tenuous one.  Feisty and intelligent, Cinder is still mostly human, and she knows her value even if it's not widely recognized by others.  She stands up for herself, despite what she is, letting who she is shine through.  Which is ultimately what the Cinderella story has always been about for me.  Under the dirt and the ash, though she's poor and despite the fact that she's a effectively a second-class citizen --  while these things have an  effect and consequence, and hold some measure of importance - these things do not make up who Cinder is.  And Cinder is a great reminder that a person's true worth comes from the strength and integrity of their character.<br /><br />Kind, intuitive, discerning, quick-witted, and a good judge of character with a genuine love for his people, Prince Kaito is everything a good future emperor should be. He manages to be authoritative and regal without being arrogant. His friendliness won me over and and it's easy to understand why even Cinder - careful, guarded Cinder - would be drawn to his charismatic personality. Though there wasn't quite as much romance as I usually prefer, the development of the friendship/romance between Kai and Cinder makes sense in the context of the story - the duty Kai has to his people and the reality of what Cinder is.  It's a tad more complicated than a simple rags-to-riches story.<br /><br />In terms of the supporting cast of Cinder, Meyer did an excellent job of rounding out all of her characters, and in particular, I found Iko, Dr. Erland, and the Lunars to be really interesting. Iko is Cinder's household droid, and the closest thing Cinder has to a best friend. To be honest, when Iko first appeared and I realized what her role would be in this story, I may have thought \\"Oh no...\\" and may have even rolled my eyes a little. However, Iko really grew on me. She became this incredibly endearing little sidekick who had hopes and dreams all her own, and I really came to enjoy her character. Second, Dr. Erland, the lead scientist working on the plague cure, I found to be one of the most interesting characters in the book. He's one of those characters who raise interesting ethical and moral questions, a character who holds a lot of depth, and I would love to know more about him. Lastly, the Lunars in general held a certain fascination for me, because ofthe way they are described - devious, murderous, ambitious - not to mention they live on the moon. But in particular, Queen Levana and her thaumaturge, Sybil Mira. These two women are very intimidating characters. Powerful, strategic and cunning, they are definitely forces to be reckoned with, and characters that at once made me wary and excited. Excited? Yes. I really do love an intelligent and formidable villain.<br /><br />One of the over-arcing themes I found extremely interesting is the question of human rights that plagues the Eastern Commonwealth. At what point does a person become less than human when altered by the technological advancements of modern medicine? In that same vein, in Cinder's world androids are commonplace. But by creating androids who learn, evolve and begin to interpret the world around them independently, mankind has in effect created a new form of sentient being. Should these beings have rights? And what about those caught in between? Those who are part-human, part-android - the cyborgs? By becoming part machine, have they lost some essential, irretrievable piece of their humanity? By prolonging their lives through science, cyborgs have gained a second chance at life, when by all rights they should be dead. But at what cost, when they are regarded by human society as a whole to be \\"less than?\\" Both cyborg and android rights are severely limited, legally they can be viewed as property, and their fate controlled by those who have guardianship over them. The moral implications of medical interference and the resulting social consequences are just extremely interesting and I found Meyer's modern, futuristic interpretation of the European social hierarchy to be extremely creative, very thought-provoking and relevant.<br /><br />Overall, with fascinating thematic elements, clever storytelling and a fantastic, updated heroine, Cinder is a fresh, enchanting and futuristic reimagining of a beloved fairytale classic.devious, murderous, ambitious - not to mention they live on the moon.

Recently, it broke and replaced it with the SB700 to try it out.  I have done several weddings by now with it and I'm so satisfied with its performance and features.  Smaller size, much more quiet zoom mechanisms, great power output. Love that it also includes a built in reflector.  Body is same size as SB900, but head is shorter.  Beats having to pay higher price.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|From my blog: [...]    Highlights: The entire cast is at the peak of their game. Bryan Cranston and Ron Perlman give solid performances that keep in line with the quality I've come to expect. The surprise of the cast is Albert Brooks. I'd never thought I would get the opportunity to say this, but Albert Brooks is a bad ass. He plays an endearing money man in an organized crime partnership with Ron Perlman, but completely wows you when he has to get cut throat. Literally.    Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling are perfect on screen together. Their quiet attraction is pulled off quiet masterfully by two actors who have a command of subtlety and body language. No other pair could have pulled this off the way they did. I bought in whole heartedly to their romance.    The sound track is perfect. Within minutes of getting home I had downloaded it from itunes and am listening to it as I write this. The score adds so much to the stoic ambience of LA's streets. The gorgeously shot downtown LA is a star in its own right in this film. The car chases are little bursts of adrenaline in an otherwise calming movie. There aren't many, but they are done well.    See Drive as soon as you can. It's a refreshing meditation of a movie and I can't wait for my next chance to watch it.    If you liked The Driver or Bullitt, you'll like Drive.

B003L77G6A|5.0|*NO SPOILERS, BY THE WAY*  This show is utterly perfect!  Jim Parson's work is it is wonderful- he is the life of this entire show.  I watched this season and a few random episodes before any others, and I still highly enjoyed the series.  The cast seems to get more comfortable with their roles the longer they play them, but I haven't found any episodes- even in season one- that I didn't like.  Plus, there's bonus footage on the DVD that I enjoyed watching.  I would also suggest searching for the bloopers on youtube.  They are absolutely hilarious!  Well, I think that's enough gushing :)  I highly recommend buying this!

1439153663|5.0|\\"The Kitchen House\\" is a masterpiece that keeps the reader enthralled from page one until the end. It follows the life of an indentured servant, Lavinia; the owners of a large Virginia plantation; and their slaves. The book is told from the viewpoints of Lavinia and Belle, one of the kitchen-house slaves.<br /><br />Grissom does a fabulous job contrasting and comparing the lifestyles between the indentured servants, kitchen-house slaves, and field workers. Compared to the field hands, the house servants felt that they had a good life; however, they knew that they could be sold at any moment. The indentured servant could rise in the social ranks, unlike the slaves; however, Lavinia's life took a turn for the worse after she gained freedom. The field hands lived at the mercy of their master, who often sold their food rather than feed them meager portions.<br /><br />Criminal actions abound in the story, but good and bad cannot easily be defined. In fact, even murder may seem to be justified. I highly recomment this book and have not read a good book that blends historical accuracy and action in a really long time.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I'm still new to this whole app thing, but this is one that I really enjoy playing.  I especially love the bandito mode. . . it always keeps you guessing!  The kids enjoy playing it too.  Super fun!!
0452273331|3.0|It is much more preferable reading philosophy through a novel filled with realistic characters than through dry discourses and arguments from Ancient Greece. However, most realistic characters do not go off on long soliloquies that can span multiple pages. The portrayal of each character is used as a means of comparison and contrast through which various people live their lives. The exaggeration of each character's principles helps portray the contrast more starkly. Although Ayn Rand said in her introduction that the purpose of the book was only to portray characters and not to write a philosophy, her philosophy of objectivism subtly comes across through her characters. Very subtly.<br /><br />Despite the criticisms of objectivism, and of Ayn Rand's sneaky nature of introducing a philosophy to her audience, there is a reason this book is a classic. It portrays characters that could be real if they were more moderate in their beliefs. In a broader sense, it can be used to portray the people around us. The book is organized into four parts, with each part outlining the method of success of each character. In a way, the reader is shown four unique methods for becoming successful. I can understand why many people use this book as a guide to living their life, because there's a part of each character in all of us.<br /><br />There are times when we may feel like Peter Keating, borrowing someone's ideas and not giving them enough credit, or flattering a superior to win praise. We may feel successful because the results of our actions may have rewarded us in some way, but there's an empty feeling that we did not deserve the praise we received.<br /><br />Other times, we may feel like Ellsworth Toohey, spouting beliefs without full conviction, trying to influence public or peer opinion for the sake of proving we have influence. Even worse, we may make our peers feel bad for an unintentional fault of theirs. It may give us a sense of influence, until we realize these people are not self-sufficient, they need others' approval to temporarily relieve them of their unhappiness. And their unhappiness is contagious.<br /><br />Rarely, but often enough, we may play the part of Gail Wynand. We know exactly what people want us to say, and we say it. We may do it because it amuses us. We may do it because it gives us power. Yet, after doing it, we realize that it was only an act. That was not our real opinion, that was not what WE wanted to say. Eventually we may realize that this false sense of power only existed as long as we said and did what others wanted us to say and do.<br /><br />Then there is our hero, Howard Roark--hated by most who see him, yet incapable of hate for anyone. He is loved by himself and the few rare people who can see him for who he is--\\"a man totally innocent of fear.\\" This is the ideal that Rand portrays in a man. Although you do not have to be as egotistic as Roark to be great and successful, the important message is that as long as you have persistence and a self-sustaining belief in your own ideas, and the drive to constantly act on them and improve them, success will come and find you!<br /><br />- MRneed others' approval to temporarily relieve them of their unhappiness.

0553382152|5.0|I really enjoyed Betty Eadie's book. This book will help those who have lost a loved one. Just to know that our life on the other side is like going home. Her experiences were beautifully written and easy to understand. Betty's book \\"The Awaking Heart\\" My continuing journey to love, should be read with this. You will want to share this book with everyone.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a wonderful free Bible app. Easy to use and there are lots of reading plans available for it. I used it previously on the iPhone version, but the app for the Kindle Fire is a lot better due to the larger screen size.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a great movie to watch of all ages; positive and inspiring.  I saw this first on TV and since then decided it was a movie to add to my library.

B004H0N4PC|5.0|I'm a long time Elbow fan and own all their previous efforts. I lost track of them and just realized they had a newer album out. However, some of the reviews here had me worried. Others said they've been fans since the beginning and just could not give this album their approval.   Lucky for me, it was on sale for $5 here on Amazon, so I took the plunge. Good thing I did. I have no idea what the negative reviews are talking about. Sure, there aren't any obvious \\"singles\\" on this album, but there isn't a song I don't like. Guy kills it with his beautiful voice and the rest of the band provides stirring and interesting music to accompany the emotions.  I know everyone has their own opinion, but I cannot understand how you could love all of Elbow's previous efforts and not enjoy this album as well.

B004U52VPS|5.0|We love this game. Had fun playing as a group or by yourself.  Can make up your own structures as well.  Great for all ages.
B005NF2UE6|3.0|Structurally, it's not much different than that of their last album, Dark Horse.<br /><br />The first track, \\"This Means War\\" is about the only one off the album that is original of any kind.<br /><br />The Second Track, \\"Bottoms Up\\" is the same kind of song as the second and last tracks track of Dark Horse, \\"Burn It to the Ground\\" and \\"This Afternoon.\\"<br /><br />The third track, \\"When We Stand Together\\" is a concept song. Dark Horse had two of those: \\"Just to Get High\\" and \\"If Today Ws Your Last Day\\" It is basically a revival of Michal Jackson's \\"Man In The Mirror.\\"<br /><br />The fourth track, \\"Midnight Queen\\" is about a hooker. Same as \\"Shakin' Hands\\" from Dark Horse.<br /><br />The fifth track, \\"Gotta Get Me Some\\" is about lustrous feelings, like \\"Something in Your Mouth\\" \\"Next Go Round\\" and \\"S.E.X.\\" from Dark Horse.<br /><br />The sixth track, \\"Lullaby\\" is your standard break up song. Like \\"I'd Come for You\\" from Dark Horse.<br /><br />The Seventh track, \\"Kiss It Goodbye\\" is another concept song. Also a MJ style song about how Hollywood will defile your personality.<br /><br />The eighth track, \\"Trying Not to Love You\\" is another standard break up song.<br /><br />The ninth track, \\"Holding on to Heaven\\" is a song like \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" from Dark Horse.<br /><br />The tenth track, \\"Everything I Wanna Do\\" is another lust song.<br /><br />The eleventh track, \\"Don't Ever Let It End\\" is your standard love song, just like \\"Never Gonna Be Alone\\" from Dark Horse.<br /><br />All in all, there are only tree GOOD songs from the album, \\"When We Stand Together\\" \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Don't Ever Let It End\\"<br /><br />The album in my opinion was not impressive and repetitive at best. This was not Nickelback's best work.
055357342X|5.0|The first 90% of this book is better than either of the first two books -- and that is saying a lot.  I just can't get enough of Arya, Bran, Tyrion, and Jon and I love the moments we get of Dany as well.  I could have done without making some of our antagonists point-of-view characters, but you know what, Martin made it work pretty well.  Now, there are two problems.  First, as I read the first two books I felt quite strongly that Martin covered up for his weakeness in developing plot with his amazing character-development skills.  I didn't realize just how much he was using death as a means of circumventing plot.  I will avoid spoilers, but lets just say in this book it becomes quite clear that killing characters is his way of either avoiding or resolving issues of plot.  It's a bit frustrating, because you never get the climax you were waiting for.  He just kills them off before he has to come up with some great ending.  Second, as the book gets close to the end it becomes clear that this was meant to be the final book of a trilogy.  So the tactics that Martin pulls out of his bag to transition this book from being the end of a trilogy to being the middle of a 7-book series is not exactly smooth.  Don't get me wrong, he ultimately succeeds.  But the transition was definitely a little bumpy.  Anyway, criticisms aside, this book does not disappoint and is a must read for anyone who read the first two books!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun ap with plenty to do. ads get old but overall its fun and you will enjoy it
0553579908|5.0|If you liked Game of Thrones, then you will equally enjoy Clash of Kings.  For every character that the first book took from us, this one gives us someone new.  And in many ways Game of Thrones, for all it gave us, was only setting up this book and the next.  In terms of strengths and weaknesses: GRRM is second to none in character development.  We come to know Arya, Jon, Dany, Bran, and Catelyn like they are our own family members.  Even secondary (and periphery) characters are very well developed.  On the other side, sometimes there are so many peripheral characters that they are difficult to keep track of.  Additionally -- and I personally don't consider this a weakness, this is just more of a warning -- Martin can be very crass, very sexually explicit, and very detailed in those ways.  This is not fantasy for grade school children, and this is certainly not C.S. Lewis or Tolkien.  The romance-novel smut makes this book all that much better for the adult reader, but the morally upright should take heed.
0756686970|5.0|Product as advertised - Extremely good value when you factor in the cost of the the character that comes with it . Quick turnaround! Would do business with this vendor again.
0553386794|5.0|This is a great book with a story that keeps you guessing.  It kept my interest from beginning to end, and at moments I debated whether this might someday trump Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />The answer though is no.  Might be a distant second place, but here's the deal --<br /><br />Martin is a magician with his pen.  He develops a character like no one, including Tolkien.  You get to know the 100th most important character in the book as if he were a close friend (or enemy).  That's how good the character development is.  But plot?  What plot?  There are themes.  There are hints that some plot or sub-plot might soon be revealed.  But there is no true plot to this book.  And that's what makes GRRM a magician.  He is so good at telling a story by developing characters that you never realize there's no real point to the story.  It just goes on and on until you're left lusting for the next book...
B004EPYZZ8|1.0|Honestly, I'm not sure what is worse; having your arm bitten off by a shark or having this movie made about the incident.  While her story in itself is certainly inspirational, there is VERY little about `Soul Surfer' that is truly inspired.  Instead, the film teeters on ridiculous while it heaps clich&eacute; upon clich&eacute; on a story that should have been told a lot better.<br /><br />`Soul Surfer' comes across like a television movie produced and (possibly) directed by Kirk Cameron.  I understand that God and his presence had a lot of influence on Bethany's life, but the way in which it is broached comes across very stagey and awkward.  The poor directorial choices make light of a serious subject and almost make the film's pivotal scenes come across somewhat unintentionally funny.<br /><br />Yes, I laughed and I feel like a terrible person because of it.<br /><br />Bethany's story is a very courageous one.  At the age of 13, and on the brink of becoming a Professional Surfer, Bethany suffered a serious injury as a result of an unexpected shark attack.  She lost her left arm.  Because of this attack, Bethany almost lost everything.  She almost lost her life, but it was her future that pressed on her the tightest.  She had to relearn everything, but she was determined to surf her heart out and she did.<br /><br />The film could have grounded itself better into taking a serious look at the effect the shark attack had on young Bethany, but instead the film seems to intent on creating yet another teen flick.  The inclusion of a heartless competitor (I mean, anyone who would despise or antagonize a young girl who just lost her arm deserves a punch in the face) was a preposterous attempt to create some drama that wasn't needed since the subject itself presented enough drama (although it wasn't handled well enough to play off that drama).  The acting all around was pretty mediocre, but Carrie Underwood takes the cake as a singer (who I love BTW) who should really stay away from acting.  AnnaSophia Robb is the only standout here (Quaid and Hunt who are usually solid suffer at the melodramatic lines they are given), delivering a remarkably astute performance that feels genuine, most of the time.<br /><br />Anyways, I would highly recommend watching some of the interviews with Bethany, for her story and her courageous rebound is beyond words inspiring; but skip this movie because it fails on nearly every level.tandout here (Quaid and Hunt who are usually solid suffer at the melodramatic lines they are given), delivering a remarkably astute performance that feels genuine, most of the time.

B000MXPE7O|4.0|I wasn't expecting a whole lot from this film, mainly because it received such a cold shoulder from critics and awards bodies alike, despite the fact that it has such a high pedigree and the subject matter is beyond baity.  Still, I wanted to see it and so I indulged my curiosity the other night to a rather surprising effect.<br /><br />I expected to be bored stiff and or unengaged and what I found was a much tighter and much more involved film than I expected.<br /><br />That isn't to say it isn't without flaws, but it certainly isn't without merit either.<br /><br />`The Good Shepherd' tells the story of one of the CIA's founding fathers, Edward Wilson.  Wilson is a sharp young man who is corralled into a very different and guarded lifestyle after being inducted into the CIA.  The timeframe of the film spans from 1939, where Wilson becomes a member of the Skull and Bones, all the way to 1961, where the Bay of Pigs plays a pivotal role in Wilson's overall development.  Taking his time to flesh out certain aspects of Wilson's life, Director Robert DeNiro (yes, THAT Robert DeNiro) allows us to come to know who this man was, even if the guarded nature of his persona makes him appear a mystery most times.  I loved the progressive nature of the film and the way that the film was so sharply edited to find a sense of tension amidst a rather cold and slow moving premise (yes, this film is void of any real action).  Still, one feels the overwhelming intensity that accompanies such a complicated lifestyle.<br /><br />To all that I admired, I would be amiss if I didn't criticize the film in parts.  For starters, Angelina Jolie is completely miscast here and truly squanders her talent.  I mean, she brings NOTHING to the table and seems completely awkward in every scene she's in.  I also found the big reveal surrounding Wilson's father to be anticlimactic and underwhelming.  I loved the angle revolving around The Bay of Pigs and Wilson's connection, and I felt that the film's finale was expertly played (if not a tad soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.<br /><br />There is a balance necessary in order to make a film's cold nature feel relatable, and little touches are needed to bring us there.  `The Good Shepherd' is far more engaging than some will suggest, but it lacks those touches to make it feel poignant to the audience.<br /><br />Still, I highly recommend seeing this; even though I understand why most won't like it.soap operatic in tone), but the emotional connection one was supposed to make between Wilson's actions and those of his father aren't as impactful as I would have wanted.

B003AQBYUG|5.0|I absolutely love the Alien movies.  I had only ever viewed them on VHS as a tween/teen and never felt like spending the money on the DVDs.  I have never seen them look as crisp and clear.<br /><br />And the price?  Wow.  So much cheaper than any US version.<br /><br />My only complaint (and it's probably more with my player than the discs) is that the menu's seem to freeze and not load as soon as I'd like.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews on this. It's very clear what you are getting. I am a fan but not a fanatic so I don't care about fancy collector cases or tons of dvd extras. I buy the movies to have and watch the movies. That's what you are getting here...the movies. For the unbeatable price (I mean come on...there are 8 movies here), you should know and expect what you are getting. If you want fancy collector cases and hours of extras, wait awhile and pay $200+ for that but for those who just want the movies to enjoy them...this is an awesome set at a great price!

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|I did enjoy the movie. However, I can confidently say that it's not seriously that great of a movie for a few reasons and I'll just go straight to the point:  1. Obvious, predictable, overused underdog story. It's predictable and a movie about boxing or even a movie about fighting using the underdog raising above the challenge is overused. The story contained little twist of any type to make you second guess the upcoming events.  2. A minor complaint but I enjoy the kid (Dakota Goyo) who reminds me of the little adorable kid in Star Wars episode 1 (Jake Lloyd). There was the scene where he was screaming on the mic in my opinion sounded obnoxious and made him seem like an overconfident noisy brat. I was not fond of the way he yells into the mic, wished it was done a bit differently. Minor complaint but a complaint, whether you see it or not.  3. I feel a bit bad for Aunt Debra, who tries to adopt him, and the way he treats her like she's the bad person. She seemed very nice in the movie and the boy treats her or rather gives the impression of a high degree of dislike that I don't really understand and disapprove of. He should have been more nice and explained to her why he want to follow his dad instead of the way he reacted.  4. The fight scenes were...well...they're nice but again predictable and it's more of a \\"I've seen this before\\" only this time with robots. The fights scenes were the typical nature of an underdog story. There's nothing new to see, rather it's sad to say that the movie doesn't even add in any new element to boxing. The robots don't have any special \\"robotic\\" movies, it's just boring o' boxing but with robots.   It's a nice movie, but no way a five stars movie. Fun, but nothing's note worthy, from the drama scenes involving the dad and the son to the fight scenes involving the robots, nothing was exceptional. Definitely not a great movie, just fun to watch. Is it a keeper? Yeah sure, but nothing memorable like \\"oh man do you remember that scenewhere...?\\" or \\"oh, I can't wait till they get to the part where...\\"  And to the reviewers calling this film \\"brilliant\\" and so forth....you're exactly the type of people the movie industry wants. Interpret the rest however you see fit....

B004WESFZW|5.0|The best thing about this movie is the choice of actors and the location. Most of the movie took place right in the area where my favorite NYC hotel is located, by the Brooklyn Bridge and Pier 17. I could watch it again just to enjoy the view. The plot was fun as long as you don't take it too seriously.<br /><br />Actors: Excellent!<br />Location: Couldn't Be Better!<br />Plot: Not Too Bad. Enjoyable. Definitely Different.<br />Music: Very Nice

B004TN7QPG|5.0|I was originally drawn to Moon+ because it offered the ability to lock your screen AND control pages with the dpad, while still offering limitless visual control options.  I've been ereading for a decade now, and I have a certain way I like things.  Moon+ lets me be as picky as I want, and offers the comfortable reading experience I need.<br /><br />Its most recent addition is integrated page sync, using dropbox (and more recently, in 2013, Google Drive page sync, which is very convenient).  Since I just got a tablet, this is a killer new feature.  When last I surveyed the competition 6 months ago, none of them had this integrated, though several had additional apps that would sync the pages outside the reader.  What's more, the developer added this and other features in response to user requests -- and it's always nice to have a responsive developer.<br /><br />The only piece of the puzzle lacking is ADE support, nice if you read library books.  But the Overdrive reader is better than it used to be and my library lets me borrow straight to kindle, so I don't mind segregating my library books, though it would be a welcome addition.  Right now, I think Moon+ is the best overall reader available on Android, but it does have at least one weak spot.  If it ever did add support for Adobe library books, it would be undeniably the best readerware out there.
B004MWI2M0|4.0|My son asked for this for Christmas and really loves it. His dad helped him put it together and he has had a lot of fun playing with it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good game to play works well with the fire. great at the Dr office . sometimes the easy to play games are the best.
B005K2XNGG|5.0|This product was shipped and arrived a month before expected. : )  Also is very high quality!  My 9 yr old son uses this for his kindle fire and loves it.  He can manage it easily and it is very protective.  My sis bought one for her son, too, on my recommendation.  She was skeptical about the velcro closer, but we have both found it to be very strong.  It is so well sewn, too.  Very sturdy.

0385535139|5.0|I have always been fascinated with this kind of stuff. I enjoy books on law, maybe its because I've been screwed so many times in my life, but I was too dumb...excuse me \\"un-knowledgeable\\" in this field that I never bother to sue anyone (Lord knows I could be a millionaire today. Thinking about it, it may be years later, but I could still win some of those cases.) Anyways the book had my interest. It's books like this that people say \\"reading is educational\\" You do learn alot....well, I did anyway. Great story, great court work. You are given characters who are lawyers yet dumb as bricks and have others that would scare the President into an early leave. A very interesting book. I'd recommend highly to anyone that enjoys law. Lots of stuff going on.<br /><br />I am also impressed with how John found the time to write this book, considering his involvement in this field.<br /><br />The characters were kinda plain. Nobody with a real sense of humor, but after years as a lawyer, it must be hard to maintain one. So, I don;t blame the characters or John for making them ordinary. However, he still did a great job at making them interesting and making us love or hate certain ones. A book I might read again soon.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a great app if u enjoy controlling your home Cpu/laptop from the road. Works great with the kindle fire but still haven't figured out the trick for my phone. Well worth it though.

B004SUWR2C|2.0|I just want to play Uno.  Not this crazy 7-0 Uno where you swap cards and Jump in where you can place your card on top of another's if it is same color same number....And the think that I don't get is if you are on blue's and someone throws a 4 card draw wild card down you can challenge them if you think they have that color in their stack and they are just using the wild card to get you to draw cards....Well in Jump in, you can't back out if you accidentally put in a draw 4 wild and so you get challenged, which means you have to pick up like 6 cards if you have the original color and what it was changed to.  But the computer people throw it down and they change it to the same color it already is so you challenge them and then you end up drawing the cards when clearly they have the color.  But if you do it then it doesn't work.  It's frustrating.  They have Uno Undercover through Gamehouse I wish they would get that.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game has it's ups, but mostly downs. Even though it has many games, I find that most of these games are CHEAP KNOCKOFFS of classic games. For example, the very first game is a knockoff of Galaga. And other games in this may be original, but are pretty lame. Like the game where all you do is bounce a soccer ball or stop pigeons from pooping on a statue. And to make things seem even EASIER, it is super easy to get other games. I only recommend this game for kids.
B00466HN86|5.0|This movie is absolutely amazing! Best Christian movie i have ever seen. If you are a parent, this is a must see.

0316017930|4.0|In the book The Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell analyzes extraordinary people and their paths toward success. Gladwell proves that skill is not the only factor that contributes to accomplishments but also factors that are out of their reach such as geographical upbringing, their date of birth, and cultural background. He brings up questions about the obvious that no one really notices.       Gladwell brings to attention that a majority of professional hockey players are born at the beginning of the year, success is about more than having an abnormally high IQ, and to ace a profession you need 10 thousand hours of practice.  He goes about proving these situations with interesting anecdotes. Along with Gladwell's stories, he also puts footnotes for further explanations, which make the book a lot easier to follow. Actual documentation from the person which the anecdote is about helps prove Gladwell's theories.        Overall, The Outliers is a good read that keeps the readers alert and thinking. At times, the reading might be slow but Gladwell's attention to detail makes the book surprisingly easier to read. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes book such as Freakonomics.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this game is a waste of time half of the games don't even work so save your time and don't get this app
B003JTHSE0|5.0|This book was slow to hook me, but I kept reading because I was just enough intrigued by the narrator. By the middle of the book I couldn't put it down. The characters of books are for me the most important part, and I found the narrator extremely likable. The writing was good, the imagery effective, and while the storyline was at first difficult to follow due to the fact that the stories are not in chronological order, I found that was not a problem after a while.   This was an informative book in a lot of ways, but mostly just a pleasant read and a reaffirmation of the power of the human spirit and the ability to rise above our circumstances.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this app it is amazing. if you love fun games you should download this app. the games are really fun.
0743298039|5.0|I am an avid reader, but between working full time and having a family, time to read is hard to come by, so I am selective about what I read. If I don't love it within the first few pages, I don't bother with the rest.  The Thirteenth Tale had me hooked almost immediately, and I stayed up late to finish the whole thing. I loved it! The writing was fluid and engrossing, the characters were relatable yet elusive, and the overall feel of the book had the warmth and energy of Jane Eyre, with a touch of the ghostliness of Wuthering Heights. The story kept me guessing, and I was happy with the ending, which I can't say about a lot of books. I hope Ms. Setterfield publishes another novel soon!
B006BDHAX0|2.0|This would be a fun game to play on my EVO 4G if it weren't for the fact that I can only play one full map and get about 3 minutes into the next one, which the game then proceeds to force close and take me to my phones homescreen.
0385341008|5.0|I read this book on accident... my mom gave it to me, and I read the title and scoffed, tossing it aside and forgetting about it. Then one day, I found myself sitting with my sleeping infant in my lap, and the only reading material within reach was Guernsey. I picked it up reluctantly... and didn't put it back down until I had finished it. Engaging characters, interesting style (letters), touching story with a sometimes heart-wrenching backdrop (reminders of the war)... I just loved it. I have re-read it multiple times just because it makes my heart happy. Great book.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|What can you say about John Cleese?  Years ago, when the bride and I were considering B and B ownership as a life style, we had the opportunity to 'study' with a B&B guru from Vermont.  During the lesson plan, he strongly suggested that we students watch and learn from the PBS series 'Fawlty Towers' as THE REAL inside scoop on lodgings.  Until that course we had never heard of the show: we watched, learned and became hooked on the absolutely enthralled with this OUTSTANDING SHOW.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Absolutely amazing album.    Granted, this is coming from a guy who adores Americana, roots rock, folk, and older-style country... so if that profile fits you, then maybe you will enjoy this, too.  Also, I highly recommend this and the rest of Brandi Carlile's catalog to people who like poetry in their lyrics.  Her lyrical content is deeply moving, and well-crafted.  If you like Brandi, or like this kind of music, check it out, as well as similar artists like Sarah McLaghlin and the Indigo Girls.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My wife and I will spend hours playing this game trying to out do each other. Great time killer. get it now.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for little games. no issues. it is fun to try all the games. my family loves it. good work.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|I read the Kindle version of the first book on my friend's Kindle before I got my own, and saw no issues with the formatting. Then when I got my own Kindle, I was really excited to buy the set for myself. I won't buy the Kindle edition though because it costs more than the physical books. It doesn't make any sense for the box set of the paperback books to cost less than the Kindle edition. Amazon I believe you have a problem once your Kindle books become more expensive than the physical copies. Part of the appeal of having a Kindle is to get books more conveniently and cheaper. I will never buy a Kindle book that is more expensive than the physical copy. That is the only reason I've given the box set a 4 out of 5 stars, because the books are fantastic, but the price of the Kindle set is, in my opinion, a huge issue.
B005NQ94LM|4.0|Once again, all I want to do is give this movie a rating to get better recommedations, but Amazon is hiding the rating system inside the movie's info page. Please bring back the rating system, Amazon. I don't want to have to write a review to improve my recommendations.
0439023483|1.0|This book was recommended by someone whose judgement I trusted. I will never let them suggest a book to me again. First of all I'm 50 yrs old, this book was written for ten yr. olds.  What a bore . .  I should have followed my gut instinct and stopped reading it after chapter one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|No more. No less. It's simple solitaire that plays well on my Kindle Fire &amp; Samsung Galaxy Nexus. Good for killing time.

0439023521|1.0|How is this not a rip off of Battle Royale?  This author plays dumb and acts like she's never heard of Battle Royale even though the storyline is pretty much identical.  For those of you who don't know, please look up Battle Royale.  It is a Japanese series of films which has a cult following.  It's just dishonest of this woman to play it off as if it's her own creation.  Why not just ADMIT that you drew ideas from Battle Royale?  These so-called \\"writers\\" of America who take ideas from foreign films and pass them off as their own are getting annoying.  Remember Juno written by Diablo Cody?  She got that idea from Jenny&Juno, a Korean film with a similar storyline.  Nowhere during press or interviews did I see or hear that tattooed freak give credit to the movie for her idea.    Give credit where credit is due.  1 star because this is something I've read/watched before and because it's a cheap knock-off.

1451627289|5.0|I was an avid King fan in his early years, with Salem's Lot and The Stand my favorites.  I have read many of his novels since that time.  His writing style can never be faulted.  But his themes, protagonists, and endings were somewhat disappointing for me.  I recently enjoyed Under the Dome, but still felt a lack of maturity in his exploration of human relationships.  With this book, King has written two beautiful, mature, love stories.  One is between Jake and  Sadie.  The other is between the author and America - both that of the 50's/60's and the present. Both are heartfelt by both writer and reader.  Even after 900 pages, I did not want the book to end. Jake is the first King character who ever made me cry - even if he had a hard time with that himself.
0062082353|5.0|This book is reminiscent of friends sitting around telling stories over a couple of beers. Folksy, one on one, and genuine.<br /><br />If you are looking for High Prose, go elsewhere.<br /><br />If you are looking for good companions, frank talk, and can face hard truths, read this book. Told plainly, without hyperbole or sensational descriptions, this book is about a common man who did an uncommon service to his country; he volunteered to protect this country during war.<br /><br />Mr. Kyle doesn't deserve criticism for doing his job. The service he and his family provided to this country stands on its own merits. He, his wife, and indeed all service men who give to this country deserve the highest regard and honor one human can give to another.<br /><br />Good job, Mr. Kyle, for an outstanding book. Thank you for sharing a sliver of what your life was like in war. It reminds me of the stories told by the veterans of D-Day.<br /><br />To anyone trying to decide whether to buy this book, I advise you to focus on reviews from people who actually read it. Critics who stand on a soapbox spouting their political agenda do not merit a closer look. Whether you agree with the war or not, walk in this man's shoes for a bit. This is a true man giving us a peephole on his life.<br /><br />Mr. Kyle, best regards to you and yours.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The most recent updated version for this app has made it much better than the original version that I downloaded.  I now have easy access to all the capabilities (all the ones I use, anyway) of the web version.  It is nicely designed and well organized to show you your watched items, betting on items and selling items.<br /><br />The quick and easy access plus the fact that it will send you notifications on auctions make this an outstanding addition to my app library.  If you use Ebay all I highly recommend this app for on the go access.
B000002L7J|5.0|This is a classic, essential recording, not only for any Smiths or Morrissey fan, but I feel for popular music fans in general.  If you've never heard this, you're in for a real treat.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a pretty fun game some are easy and some are hard to play and they give you coins to help open other games the more you play. fun for kids and adults the only negative this is the ads and having to click play again
B004EI3ON4|5.0|I have rarely heard scores that literally MADE a movie as much as this one does.  Conan the Barbarian (1982) has long been one of the standard-bearers of a movie that is made so much more by the score that accompanies it, and Tron Legacy is another one of the rare films that you come out of there commenting first on the music, then the movie itself afterwards (for Tron Legacy the things the audience takes away from this are the outstanding music and special effects).  The story and acting in this film are nothing amazing, but the music takes an average movie and makes it that much better.<br /><br />I love love love LOVE this score and whoever made the decision to suggest Daft Punk do the music deserves a BIG raise.  Keep in mind that this music is NOT for everyone, but if you like electronica/trancey music, you will be SO glad you own this.<br /><br />Notable Tracks:<br /><br />4. Recognizer ****<br />7. Rinzler ****<br />8. The Game Has Changed ****<br />12. End Of Line ****<br />13. Derezzed ****<br />14. Fall ***** (Standout track on the score, the type you get chills from)<br />18. C.L.U. ****<br />21. Tron Legacy ****<br /><br />One of the best scores I've ever had the pleasure to listen to.  Daft Punk should be eternally proud of this masterpiece.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
B003G4W49C|2.0|My late father read this book atleast 5 times and he always raved about it. Then my older brother read it and loved it. My younger brother followed suit and felt the same. I guess they hyped it up for me so I was expecting too much. I really didn't care for it at all. Please , all you fans of Enders Game out there, don't hate me too much. Everybody is different and has different \\"tastes\\". I'm just trying to be honest about my impressions of reading \\"Enders Game\\".
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Update:   I saw \\"Captain America\\" again for the third time. This time projected from a 35mm print and, while there are a few brief moments which were designed for 3D that aren't quite as cool in 2D, overall it is a much more rewarding experience than the underlit 3D presentations I saw. This is really a bright, colorful film with lots of detail in the action, sets, backgrounds, and facial expressions which are lost in the dimness of digital presentation. Well worth a second viewing if you can find someplace running it on film. I expect that the DVD and Blu-Ray will be closer to the brightness of film than the dimness of digital theatrical projection.  Original post:  Saw \\"Captain America\\" twice already. Both times in 3D (which ain't too shabby). Liked it the first time. Liked a lot better the second time - for a couple of reasons.  The first is that I wasn't distracted reconciling the movie with the comics. The movie is very, very good but, like [[ASIN:B0034G4P80 Thor]], it has the job of filling in all of the back story needed for The Avengers in 2012 and there's a LOT more back story. Captain America really deserved Iron Man's two film lead in. And, as much as the movie does an impressive job adapting decades of story into two hours there are inevitable differences some of which were a bit jarring to me. On second viewing I could appreciate the movie for itself because I already knew where it differed from the stories I was familiar with.  The second viewing, I saw the movie with my teenage daughter who knows almost nothing about the character and I was curious how she would respond to it. We, of course, stayed through the credits for the anticipated after credit scene and then this occurred:  The movie ends. Daughter turns to me.  Daughter: \\"Really?\\"  We stand and walk to the end of the row.  Daughter: \\"Really?\\"  We walk up the aisle a bit.  Daughter: \\"An ad?\\"  And a bit farther.  Daughter: \\"That's stupid.\\"  A bit farther.  Daughter: \\"As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?\\"  We exit the theater and in the lobby are four of her friends. They greet and hug and ask \\"what are you seeing? and \\"what did you see?\\"  Friend: \\"We're going to see Harry Potter again.\\"  Daughter: \\"Captain America\\"  Friend: \\"Cool. How is it?\\"  Daughter: \\"Ummm...\\"  Friend: \\"Oh. That good?\\"  Daughter: \\"Well ...\\"  Friend: \\"What would you rate it?\\"  Daughter: \\"Mmmm...three stars.\\"  Friend: \\"Oh.\\"   The friends obviously have no interest in seeing Captain America now.  Daughter: \\"But stay 'til the end\\"  Daughter: \\"It's disappointing, but stay 'til the end.\\"  The friends obviously now have less than no interest in seeing Captain America.  We leave the theater, walking to the car.  Daughter: \\"That free-fall fight was cool!\\"  Me: \\"Yeah. I liked that a lot, too.\\"  Daughter: \\"I'd have probably given it four stars but that ad at the end was a dumb move.\\"  Me: \\"I liked the movie a lot more this time. I think because I knew what to expect and wasn't trying to reconcile the movie with the comics and I knew when the movie really ended and when to stop expecting more. I think the ad at the end colored my feelings about the movie, too.\\"  Daughter: \\"Yeah. When we sat through the credits and it said 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' I though 'We stayed for that?'. But then the tag and the ad played and I thought 'ending with 'Captain America returns in The Avengers' would have been better. Or ending after the little punching bag scene. It wouldn't have been GOOD, but it would have been BETTER.\\"  The moral: Marvel Studios, which had been doing a great job building anticipation for The Avengers with the tag scenes after the credits which teased and enticed, went for the hard sell. I doubt that that hard sell is building audience because, as daughter said, \\"As if the people who stay through the credits aren't already waiting to see 'The Avengers'?\\" But the hard sell almost certainly lost the sale of four tickets to Captain America which daughter's friends had been interested in (and had both time and disposable income to spend for) because the Avengers ad disappointed her and unfavorably influenced her immediate response to the movie.   Y'know, for good word of mouth you want to send people out on a high note, not feeling like they've been subject to a bait and switch; expecting the tradition of a cool teaser tag to continue in this movie but being delivered a tiny anemic tag followed by a routine and traditional ad.

My past experiences with Amazon have been terrific and will continue using Amazon to purchase other items sold directly from you.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Not every story has a Hallmark ending. The Hunger Games is a stark reminder that when  children are swept into traumatic events such as war they are scarred by the experience. Suzanne Collins is not the only author unafraid to tackle this thorny subject. John Marsden's amazing 'Yesterday, When The War Began' is, if possible, an even better series. Read it if you dare.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Judging from the broad variability in reviews either different versions/models of this cover have shipped (some fit Kindle Fire/others don't; some have magnets/others don't; some close/others don't; some have a horrid chemical smell/others don't; etc....) or the sellers have had difficulty with quality control.<br /><br />I just purchased mine on New Years Eve 2011/2012 on the site which stated: \\"Verso Artist Series Cover for Kindle Fire, Cities, Red\\". I seem to have been one of those fortunate to get all the elements right: it does fit my Kindle Fire, it has no fragrance at all, the elastic bands are extremely tight making it difficult to get the Kindle fitted in - but that is exactly as I would want it to ensure the Kindle stays secure.<br /><br />Most importantly, once the practical considerations are all addressed, this is an absolutely gorgeous cover. As a lifelong reader, I own more books than anyone I know. Books hold a special place in my life and although I was an early adopter with computers, I had held out on using an e-reader until now. One day with the Kindle Fire and I'm utterly hooked; I have transferred my allegiance overnight.<br /><br />All the more reason that I get such enormous pleasure from the old-word elegance of this Kindle cover redolent of old private libraries with leather-bound volumes, hand-crafted wooden globes and large, comfortable high-backed reading chairs. The mischevious irony behind this design brings a smile to my face -- I feel suspended between two worlds, both of which bring great pleasure: the traditional aesthetics of holding a beautiful bound volume and the modern aesthetics and convenience of this great reading technology.<br /><br />Yesterday I stood in Starbucks reading \\"The Road to Serfdom\\" as I waited for my coffee. I was approached by a Mexican day laborer who spoke very little English, not even full sentences. In heavily accented English he said \\"A beautiful book. Very beautiful.\\" This was deeply touching. He of course saw it was a Kindle case. But I think he shared with me a deep appreciation for great traditional craftsmanship - which this cover is designed to portray. Despite the fact that it's not the real thing (thank goodness! this is protective and sturdy but very light weight) it is a delight to the eye. While it may not have required great craftsmanship to produce this 21st century piece, it is clearly the product of thoughtful, inspired design with great artistic sensibility. A delight for any serious booklover who appreciates traditional Italian aesthetics/design as well as the practical convenience of modern technology.think he shared with me a deep appreciation for great traditional craftsmanship - which this cover is designed to portray.

B004J7D3TK|5.0|I know that this movie is only about 40% accurate but It was close enough to what I have read about the beginnings of Facebook for me to really appreciate the founding of this amazing company. The dialogue is top notch and I love the way the movie goes from the legal meetings to the actual events that preceeded them. Watch this movie if you haven't already.
B006C45CFG|4.0|As good as it is - and it is very, very good - \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\" left me wishing I'd been given deeper understanding of the characters and more background of the town, the Apache, and the aliens. In some ways, a good sign that I was left hungry for this because it indicates how much I was made to care and wonder about the people and their world by what was revealed, but it left a nagging dissatisfaction.   I wonder if the comic book has more of what I hunger for.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Having watched Too Big To Fail (TBTF), The Last Days of Lehman Brothers (LD) and Margin Call (MC) over a relatively short time, I am now catching up on my reviews.<br /><br />From 2002-2007 I worked for a Wall Street Firm in Mortgage Capital.  I offer this as a source of perspective.<br /><br />I have a very good friend who worked in what can be best described as a very senior back office capacity re: mortgages, on the West Coast.  He recently watched the movie and thought that it was badly paced and that the script didn't do enough with the star studded ensemble cast.  I respectfully disagree.  IMHO, what makes this movie great is that it took a large number of recognizable actors and placed them all in one dimensional roles.  What is this you say, one dimensional roles don't often make for a good movie?  In this movie and with such a large cast, the risk is that actors will often step out of their respective roles in an effort to get marquis billing, which can result in both over playing their role and a highly uneven telling of the story. What is great here is that no one actor outperforms the other.<br /><br />Having sat on a trading floor for 5+ years, so much of what was portrayed rang true:<br /><br />1.) The method by which employees are terminated.  At my firm they did things slightly different.  Those that were to be let go were called to a meeting in a conference room, while those that were retained were given a private audience where a retention agreement was offered.  Some firms did actually escort you out of the building, though the image of walking out the door with a box of your personal belongings in highly accurate<br /><br />2.) The confused looks of management when they were shown the conclusions reached by the current risk model.  It is important to note that in most situations the models that are written to both book P&L and manage risk are developed by \\"quant's\\" and that Sales & Trading may at best have a limited understanding of the underlying assumptions.  The more senior management, the less likely the understanding.  This was portrayed brilliantly in MC<br /><br />3.) The military like \\"sacrificial lambs\\".

When the decision was made exit the business by being first out, despite the large losses.  This was not in the film for dramatic effect.  When things were imploding, the general philosophy was that the first loss is the best loss!<br /><br />I personally liked the scene where the Paul Bettany character is standing on the roof with the 2 junior guys while giving an accounting of how he spent his bonus.  I also thought that the scene where the Sales Manager (Kevin Spacey) called a meeting of the sales staff where he essentially said you are all gone at the end of the day and while I realize that you will be jeopardizing both your professional integrity and future employability, we will pay you each \\"$XXX\\" million if you unload \\"XXX\\" of the firm's positions by EOB.  Subsequently, watching the Paul Bettany character starting the day selling in the 90's and ending in the 60's was chilling.  I mean how would you like to be that trader that bought 30-points high in the beginning of the trading day!<br /><br />I do admit that MC might appeal more to people that have some connection to the industry and have tried for years to explain to friends and family both what the work environment was like and what we actually did for a living!

B006JTS5OO|1.0|I've been a Muppet fan since I was a kid, and I was stunned of how bad this film was. It didn't have the spark of a True Muppet Movie. Muppet Movies are supposed to have a mix between Kid & Adult Humor, this had None! Not to mention... the Voice Actor's have changed, but there's no control over that :( but still. Also! NO RIZZO! You CAN NOT have a Muppet Movie without Rizzo! And the Plot of the movie... not that good. Sorry but I'm saving my money on this one and purchasing all the other Extraordinary Muppet Movies!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app; it is my favorite of the free weather apps. I gave it 4 stars because of its fixed orientation.  I like the at-a-glance page with all of the basic data.  I think this app has the best radar, which the TWC app does not even have.

B0060V1WJ6|4.0|Appears to be a raunchy sex comedy but is actually sneakily good-hearted and earnest and delivers a much more satisfying experience than the raunchy sex comedy would have. One brilliant scene announces two alternative movie conventions, declares what's going to happen, and then proceeds to flout the convention naturally, humorously, endearingly, and very satisfyingly.
0307949508|5.0|Wow.  I thought that The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was a nail biter.  Then along comes the sequel and makes the first book feel like an idyllic little tale.<br /><br />Both Salander and Blomkvist are back, but not quite together.  This time the mystery surrounds Salander with links to her past.  That is all that I will say about the plot, because I do not want to give it away.<br /><br />Like the first book of the Millennium series, Larsson began slowly and methodically building the story, but then I suddenly found that I could not put the book down.<br /><br />I will say this book has a bit of a cliffhanger ending, which is a pet peeve of mine; however, it was such a good read that I am willing to overlook it.<br /><br />I am eagerly anticipating the third and final book of the series.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|lovin it... great app and I woukld pay for it now! I'm just typing extra words to meet rating reqs
B005H5H3LW|5.0|I'm not much for writing reviews, but I loved this movie. It's all in Japanese with English subtitles, but listening to it in its original language conveys the emotion that dubbing into English would have lost. It's definitely a Japanese version of Star Wars with excellent special effects. Granted, they squeezed 3 seasons of Star Blazers cartoons into a two hour movie but it is well done and follows the story well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app works smoothly and without any problems? I have tried several others and this is the best I have found
0425220931|5.0|This book helped me make the connection from my lessons to my playing. It also serves well as lessons in life. Highly recommended reading for all players of any level.
B00650SSWG|4.0|Surprisingly good. The broad arch of the story is routine and predictable but the details are well-defined, well-written, interesting, and delivered with conviction and credibility by a top notch cast. I was completely engaged from start to finish. I even teared up right on cue. Damn them for manipulating my emotions so well.   Oh, wait, that's their job.   Well done!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Good review of the word and easier to find books or verses in church. Overall I would give a 5 star but it only has KJV ofgline. I would like to see the NIV version was available off line.
1416905014|5.0|Our grandkids loved this book. It has more words than the usual pop-up books we have bought them in the past but they have a longer attention span and were able to enjoy the story and visuals. We enjoy buying one pop-up book every Christmas and think this book hit the mark for them this year.
0553801473|2.0|I want to start off by saying that i thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 books-yes, i said 4, in the series. With that being said, I want to say that this book did not remotely feel like one of Martin's books. I think that other readers will agree with me when I say that this book did not even feel like the previous 4 novels. ADWD disappointed me in the fact that it did not even have the Martinesque feel that the previous novels had. 2.5 stars, but not deserving of the curve.

B006O5XYWG|3.0|The apes are amazing in close up but never quite escape CGI artificiality in motion. The actors are all good but given little to do except embody basic caricatures, establish plot points , and move from place to place. I enjoyed it for what it was, though, and it does rise a bit above the sum of it's parts. There are several references to the original Apes films; some subtle and well-integrated, others a bit awkward and obvious.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun... games could be easier to unlock, but most of them are fun little time savers. what more could you need?

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Brilliant app! Works exactly as advertised, with minimal setup that can be completed in under 2 minutes. There is a bit of lag over the Internet, but that's to be expected. Virtually none via wifi on my home network though. This remote desktop has gotten me out of a pinch more than once now when I've forgotten a file at home or forgotten to start a task before leaving. Using on Kindle Fire btw.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've been using the app for around four days with my 64bit Vista laptop and Sensation 4G phone. From my experience so far, I would highly recommend this app.   Setup was a breeze, and I had full control of my laptop using my phone in no time. I've watched movies from the connected external hard drive over a Wi-Fi connection with no lag. I've had access to all of my files. I have not tried playing any games remotely, as the button scheme isn't intuitive enough for playing an action game.   If you need remote access to your computer though, this app works great.

B00130VLZ4|4.0|Remember film SLRs that had the 2-piece leather cases with one piece that attached to the body of the camera and the other that flipped over the lens and snapped to the body case? Unsnap and drop the lens cover...take a picture...re-snap and move along. Well, they don't have those any more, but this comes pretty close. When unsnapped, the whole case removes fairly effortlessly (with your standard 18-55MM kit lens) and there's a little loop that snaps around the neck strap to keep everything nearby. The semi-firm case makes camera egress and reholstering easier than neoprene types that I've tested, and the \\"nose\\" piece seems sturdy enough to nicely protect things so the the occasional bump against an event turnstile or car door doesn't result in a scratched polarizer or worse. In all, I recommend it over other options.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Well done.  Good music and great puzzles. Well worth the purchase price. I have been playing this one for hours.  Keep them coming!

I did not like it at all and I can't say that about many books.   Not good.
B004I1AGTC|3.0|but sadly, this is not the case. There is a certain mysticism about martial arts that I hold dear, and I do not like it tainted by, of all things, Western Boxing!!! I was enjoying this movie up until these amazing martial artists were pitted against a boxer. Please. I find it absurd that a boxer, I don't care how big, could contend with the style a martial arts expert such as IP Man would pose, especially limited to pure boxing constraints. Perhaps Im taking this too serious, but the way IP Man was built up in the original, virtually untouchable, to be almost beaten by a boxer, ludicrous. That big baboon would not even be able to lay a blow on him when fighting fairly. Oh well, good movie, but kind of ruined by taking me out of the martial arts world and into the boring world of boxing. Does anyone even watch that anymore? It may have been more believable had it been a mixed martial arts/UFC/cage fighter.

B00005MARU|5.0|I have adored this recording for almost 40 years thanks to my older sister who turned me onto it back in the early 70's. Man those were great times and what great music to boot. About 20 years ago I found I could hear the initial notes of the next track in my head before it even started. So I decided to listen to it in reverse order starting with the last track and working my way back to the first. Not only did I hear the tunes in a whole new light but it actually works better that way. So I've listened to it that way ever since and I encourage you to give it a try as well. Let me know what you think. Enjoy!

It was good to know and to note that it comes at you in such a matter of fact way, it's almost a given when in fact, it's news or at least newsworthy. I think it's a whale of a book masquerading as a research paper and i really enjoyed \\"Drive.\\"

B000NQRE0K|4.0|This is a very good movie, however, I'd have prefered it was more well-rounded. I was wondering why they did not delve into the signifigance and source of the blue war-paint, nor show any pre-war rituals that would have further defined the culture and belief systems of the clans during that period in history.<br />Instead, I was left feeling battle-weary and glad it was over.<br /><br />Costuming and sets were authentic looking, casting was good and Mel did a passable Scottish accent.  Cinematography was very good too.  Still, it could've been better.<br /><br />**Not for children
B005OOL1IC|1.0|How many ways can you go wrong in a comedy movie ? Watch this steaming pile and find out. So first start with a \\"lost time\\" premise and beat the hell out of it, fill it with sub par acting,poor comedic timing and even lamer jokes and you have this poor excuse for a film. This has to be the worst sequel ever ! I really hope there isn't ging to be a third !

B005OK725M|5.0|So if you are looking for a fun action flick, especially with a female butt-kicking protagonist, this is the one. With Jason Bourne level of over-the-top fighting, it's a fun ride. If you are looking for deep emotional connection, well, look somewhere else. Like many of these movies, I really want to meet the HVAC contractors who put up these super-strong air ducts, that don't flex/collapse and make no noise when moving inside of them... Zoe Saldana is stunning to look at, and makes a compelling action star.<br /><br />The movie opens with her child-version actress who does a great parkuor through the favela of Bogata, which is well filmed, and like a child (running in a school-girl outfit no less) she does not possess crazy skills which would make this more comic-book-like as in Chloe Moretz (who stole that movie BTW) in Kick-Ass, and instead more believable as a child with serious skills who will grow up to be a serious assassin. The adult version uses all sorts of creative attacks from full frontal assault to human-engineering attacks to get on the inside; and yes, stuff blows up! And watching her slink around in a catsuit is not a hardship either.<br /><br />Unfortunately the \\"digital copy\\" is an ultraviolet, instead of a real digital copy, but such are the breaks.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case is fine, it is slim and light weight.  The cover can be used to make a stand as advertised.  It is not the greatest as you have to line up the edge of the cover with a groove in the case, but it works fine.  The Fire fits perfectly into the case, no problem at all.  The only minor problem is the inside of the cover flap collects pet hair and dust, sinc it is some type of felt.  I dropped the fire once, in the case, with the cover secured and no damage at all...  I am happy with this purchase.

B001FVMIWQ|5.0|One thing I've loved about Ray LaMontagne's sound is the vintage, warm vibe it creates.

The packaging is beautiful, the quality is solid, and it translates to vinyl flawlessly. Definitely worth it.

B0060ZJ78U|5.0|Moneyball (Biography, Drama, Sport)<br />Directed by Bennett Miller<br />Starring Brad Pitt, Jonah Hill and Philip Seymour Hoffman<br /><br />Sony Pictures  2011  133 min  Rated PG-13  Released Jan 10, 2012<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD Copy<br />BD-Live<br /><br />The Film 4.5/5<br /><br />Moneyball is a refreshing change from the usual type of sports movie. How many times have you watched the story of an underdog triumphing? How many movies introduce us to a controversial coach who is initially resented because of his methods and then revered by all when he succeeds? This story is certainly a celebration of success, but not in the typical sense. In fact, it asks us to define success.<br /><br />It's based on the true story of how General Manager Billy Beane (Pitt) employed a new way of thinking in order to enable the Oakland Athletics to compete with the likes of the New York Yankees. He did this with just one third of the payroll of that available to the Yankees.The opening scenes show Beane negotiating with the team's owner. He knows that his payroll won't jump from $40 million to $120 million, but can he get a little more money to help the A's compete?<br /><br />The first thing I was taught in my college marketing class was to define the problem. How you can analyze a problem if you don't know what it is? You won't solve anything until you know what you are trying to do. I find that I use the same technique in all areas of my life. If a friend needs help or advice, I ask a series of questions so that they can eventually define their own problem. It works. That's what Beane did at the start of Moneyball.<br /><br />Beane's first move was to hire Peter Brand (Hill); an economics graduate from Yale. Instead of relying on traditional scouting methods, Brand used statistical analysis to determine the true value of baseball players. Instead of paying huge salaries based on a player's potential, he sought out value by considering players who were believed to have flaws. These might include injury or advancing age. Beane collaborated with Brand to assemble a team on a low budget. Departing stars were replaced with players who were a good fit for the team.<br /><br />I have a strong connection with the film because the way Beane and Brand think reminds me of how I manage my Fantasy Football teams. Which players are good value because age or injury has changed people's perceptions of their true ability? How much are this year's top draft picks really going to be worth when compared to proven veterans? I make those determinations every year when I build my team. Beane and Brand think like I do, and we tend to like people who are similar to ourselves.<br /><br />I rely on my own way of thinking rather than following conventional wisdom. That doesn't mean I will ignore everything, but I will question the opinions of others and decide whether I agree. It's something I have done my entire life and one reason I review movies. You might not agree with me, and that's absolutely fine, but at least you know that I'm not just repeating the opinions of others. Take a look at my thoughts on The Artist if you want an example.<br /><br />Groupthink is a dangerous thing. I encounter it every year in my Fantasy Football leagues when the rankings of the \\"experts\\" all start to look the same. If you go against the grain, you'll have to be ready to defend your view. As a result, people are afraid to say what they really think or act on their true instincts. It also happens in the workplace. In fact, you can find examples of groupthink every day if you seek out opinions on the Internet on just about any topic.<br /><br />Back to Moneyball.<br /><br />Look at how Beane's scouts present their opinions. How many are really their opinions, and how many of them fail to think outside the established framework?<br /><br />The dialogue is intelligent and full of humor. Some of the scenes, such as Beane pursuing trades with other teams, are quite exciting. Pitt and Hill work well together and are in most of the scenes. One source of conflict is Coach Art Howe (Hoffman). He's concerned about his own situation and future in the sport, and is reluctant to adopt Beane's desired strategy.<br /><br />I enjoyed Moneyball because it was different and the story was told in an appealing way. I won't ruin the ending for those who don't remember whether the A's won the World Series, but I will say that the story doesn't show a huge amount of baseball action. This is about the people behind the scenes and the way in which they affected the sport.<br /><br />Rarely has 133 minutes of Dialogue been so interesting. The time passes almost too quickly. I've seen Moneyball about six times since buying it in January, so there's no need to wonder about the replay value. From my ramblings in this review, you can see how thought-provoking the story can be.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />One final point I would like to consider is Beane's decision at the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of us are trained at a very young age to chase success and be the best we can be. Success is usually defined as having a good job, a great salary, expensive and prestigious possessions, and a traditional family. If we reach any of our goals, we set new ones and want more. We always want more.<br /><br />Beane's final decision mirrored his thoughts on baseball management. He considered what would truly make him happy. I don't see people thinking along those lines very often. We are trapped by the expectations of society. It's groupthink on a grand scale. Ask your friends what they dream of. How many mention money? That's the wrong answer. Money is a tool that helps you live the way you want to live, but it's not the overall goal. The goal is different for everyone and should be what makes you happy. Does your lifestyle actually allow you time to enjoy that happiness?<br /><br />Would you have made the same choice as Beane?<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br /><br />Sony's presentation looks great for the most part.

How many are really their opinions, and how many of them fail to think outside the established framework?<br /><br />The dialogue is intelligent and full of humor. Some of the scenes, such as Beane pursuing trades with other teams, are quite exciting. Pitt and Hill work well together and are in most of the scenes. One source of conflict is Coach Art Howe (Hoffman). He's concerned about his own situation and future in the sport, and is reluctant to adopt Beane's desired strategy.<br /><br />I enjoyed Moneyball because it was different and the story was told in an appealing way. I won't ruin the ending for those who don't remember whether the A's won the World Series, but I will say that the story doesn't show a huge amount of baseball action. This is about the people behind the scenes and the way in which they affected the sport.<br /><br />Rarely has 133 minutes of Dialogue been so interesting. The time passes almost too quickly. I've seen Moneyball about six times since buying it in January, so there's no need to wonder about the replay value. From my ramblings in this review, you can see how thought-provoking the story can be.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />One final point I would like to consider is Beane's decision at the end of the film.<br /><br />Most of us are trained at a very young age to chase success and be the best we can be. Success is usually defined as having a good job, a great salary, expensive and prestigious possessions, and a traditional family. If we reach any of our goals, we set new ones and want more. We always want more.<br /><br />Beane's final decision mirrored his thoughts on baseball management. He considered what would truly make him happy. I don't see people thinking along those lines very often. We are trapped by the expectations of society. It's groupthink on a grand scale. Ask your friends what they dream of. How many mention money? That's the wrong answer. Money isa tool that helps you live the way you want to live, but it's not the overall goal. The goal is different for everyone and should be what makes you happy. Does your lifestyle actually allow you time to enjoy that happiness?<br /><br />Would you have made the same choice as Beane?<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br /><br />Sony's presentation looks great for the most part. There's plenty of detail and depth. Colors appear accurate and well-defined. The only minor fault is the presence of noise in many of the scenes.

B006DHAT5K|3.0|\\"How many relationships do I have to have before I meet the right guy?\\" Ally (Faris) is having a bad day after breaking up with her boyfriend she loses her job.  While on the way to her sisters she reads an article in a magazine that says the average number of men a woman sleeps with in her life is 10.5.  When she finds out her number is higher she makes a plan to not sleep with anyone else until she meets \\"the one\\".  With help from her neighbor Colin (Evans) she tracks down her old loves.  Going in I was actually expecting a lot worse then what I saw.  There were some really funny parts in this, but for me this was way to much of a chick flick to fully enjoy.  I can't be too hard on it though because I am a guy and the movie was not meant for me, but this was hard for me to get through.  On the other hand my girlfriend laughed but also wasn't that impressed.  This is worth a watch though, but after one time that may be enough.  Overall, a chick flick that will be hard for guys to make it through.  I give it a B-.

B006RED4GA|3.0|First, let me say I loved Ti West's House of the Devil. I loved his willingness as a director to take his time, build tension, and then hit you with a hammer. I was so excited to the see The Innkeepers. If you're a fan, take the time to support Mr. West and independent horror, but...   While this film also took its time and built tension, it never really paid off. Sure the performances were strong and believable. Sure the protagonists were cute and endearing.  Sure there is an element of danger under the surface, but it never really comes together.  The ending would have been more satisfying had it not taken so much time to arrive. The ending is believable enough and bears the hall marks of solid Twilight Zone episode, but again, I wanted more for my time and ten bucks.  I will definitely continue to follow Ti West.  He is a fantastic director in training, but The Innkeepers left me wanting.

0060873027|5.0|Michael Crichton's fiction has terrified readers for years: THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN, EATERS OF THE DEAD, CONGO, SPHERE, RISING SUN, JURASSIC PARK, and more. Attention to hair-raising details and plausible scientific facts were the hallmarks of his writing and the elements of his craft that made his stories so frightening. His many bestsellers had kept us up at night thinking about the unimaginable. When Crichton died in 2008, the world of fiction readers collectively lamented the loss of one of the greatest thriller writers of our time.  During the height of Crichton's popularity, another formidable fear was jumping off the bookshelves at an impressive rate: Richard Preston's THE HOT ZONE, the nonfiction tale of the very real ebola virus. The true-life thriller introduced its audience to the horrors of a ravaging and threatening disease that resulted in its victims \\"bleeding out.\\" Like Crichton, Preston excelled at exacting detail that at once fascinated and repulsed the reader. A huge bestseller, THE HOT ZONE kept people up at night dreading a biological enemy and a pandemic threat that was all too possible.  So when a partially completed manuscript was found after Crichton's death and it was announced that Preston had been chosen to complete it, the word \\"perfect\\" came immediately to mind. Who better to finish the work of a master thriller writer than another master thriller writer? And so MICRO was born.  MICRO is the story of seven graduate students, stars in their burgeoning fields, who are recruited by a start-up company, Nanigen MicroTechnologies. The novel opens when Peter Jansen and his labmates are visited by his brother Eric and two officers of the microbiology firm. The students are quickly whisked off to Hawaii to visit the labs, and from that moment on, the pace of the book never stops. Vin Drake, the CEO of the company, manages to miniaturize the students when he fears they are on to a deadly secret held by very few people. They escape into the rainforest, where the true perilous action unfolds and the writing exceeded my expectations. The descriptions of miniature scientists scrambling up trees, stumbling over nematodes, fighting off an army of ants, encountering hungry grubs, hungry birds, hungry bats, hungry hungry hungry animals are nothing short of spectacular.  In fact, the human characters take a backseat to the scientific concepts and the flora and fauna of the lush forests of Oahu.   Preston has done an admirable job of weaving a seamless story from Crichton's detailed notes. To both their credit, the secret of MICRO is revealed early on in the novel, and yet the writing keeps you engaged. Where Crichton ends and Preston begins in unclear. It all works as one compelling voice. What is clear is that Preston can hold his own as a fiction writer, and if there are any other unfinished Crichton pieces lying about, Preston is up to the task of completing them.

0307959856|5.0|Typically I've been quite skeptical of the recent spate of Jane Austen-inspired sequels and spin-offs. After all, who could possibly hope to approach Austen's own near-perfect prose style and satirical wit? But when I heard that P. D. James, one of the acknowledged masters of the classic whodunit, was taking on this masterpiece of classic literature, I was intrigued. It turns out that this match is just as unexpected --- and just as perfect --- as the union of Elizabeth Bennet with Mr. Darcy.  For one thing, James approaches her subject both humbly and playfully, as can be seen right away in her author's apology that opens the book: \\"I owe an apology to the shade of Jane Austen for involving her beloved Elizabeth in the trauma of a murder investigation.... No doubt she would have replied to my apology by saying that, had she wished to dwell on such odious subjects, she would have written this story herself, and done it better.\\"  Not wishing to assume that all her readers are conversant with the characters and subplots of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, James next brings everyone up to speed with a clever, pitch-perfect nine-page summary of Austen's original novel before turning to her own setting: Pemberley --- the country manor of Fitzwilliam Darcy --- in 1803, six years after his marriage to Elizabeth. The happy couple now has two young sons, and Elizabeth (much to the disappointment of the naysayers to their marriage) has more than capably risen to the task of being the mistress of Pemberley. When the novel opens, Elizabeth is in the thick of last-minute preparations for Lady Anne's Ball, the key event on Pemberley's annual social calendar.  The night before the ball, however, Elizabeth's plans --- not to mention the comfortable sense of community and ease at Pemberley --- are more than disrupted when her younger sister Lydia arrives at the house in distress and disarray. She --- or, rather, her disreputable husband Wickham, who has a long and troubled history with the Darcy family --- has not been welcome at Pemberley for many years. But when Lydia arrives, speaking incoherently about shots in the woods and her husband's disappearance, Elizabeth and Darcy take her in. Soon Darcy and the other men take charge of the situation, discovering that Wickham's colleague, Captain Denny, has indeed been murdered, and it appears Wickham is the prime suspect. An inquest and trial soon follow, and the sense of propriety and privilege at Pemberley may never be the same.  P. D. James has always excelled at the country house murder mystery, and Pemberley is the quintessential literary country house, so it is perhaps no wonder that James is uniquely qualified to pull off a truly inspired Austen sequel. Although her writing possesses its own elegance, James doesn't try to replicate Austen's prose style. She also keeps postmodern commentary to a minimum, although readers will appreciate clever asides such as Elizabeth's reflection on her speedy change of heart toward Mr. Darcy: \\"If this were fiction, could even the most brilliant novelist contrive to make credible so short a period in which pride had been subdued and prejudice overcome?\\"  Certainly James's novel is a credible and delightful homage to Austen's classic, but it is also (not surprisingly) a compelling whodunit in its own right. Full of red herrings, plot twists and unexpected conclusions, DEATH COMES TO PEMBERLEY is a terrific portrait of the life of a 19th-century country house, a welcome reunion with beloved characters, and a gripping murder mystery, as attractive to Austen fans as it will be to mystery novel aficionados.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a book that relys heavily on a gentle charm, and building up characters that you grow to really care about.  Jamie who has a horrific childhood in his past, leads a very sterile lonely life.  Despite this there is a sort of naive purity about him, and you can't help hoping that he'll be able to break loose from the past that haunts and keeps him from being the man he could be.  The other main character in the book is Lydia who has been stifled by a strict mother and father, and needs to learn to stretch her wings and grow.  And grow she does, becoming more independent and more and more likeable as you read more and more about her.    There's a nice humor in the book that balances with the bleak, almost painful flashbacks to Jamie's orphanage.  Jamie's friends Paddy and Rose are great characters, loyal and kind and again, gently amusing.  I found myself breaking a long standing rule and actually reading ahead to the end because I was just so curious how it all turned out.  As for the few negatives, the Irish dialect was a little hard to follow, and I thought Lydia's mother was much too strict and unlikeable to have suddenly done an about face and written her daughter a very sweet, loving letter.  There was nothing in the writing on this character to suggest that she felt such a passion for Lydia.  I do recommend this book-I believe this is a book you'll find hard to put down.  And the twist at the end was something I did not see coming.

B004J4WKUQ|3.0|This book illustrated the difference between reading as a reader and reading as an author. The crux of the problem: my inner geek fell in love with this book, while the objective side of my mind had a hard time overlooking the flaws. This is an attempt to tackle critique from both viewpoints. Keep that in mind if this review is a bit fractured.<br /><br />My two sides didn't always war; they agreed on the characters, or rather, the lack thereof. I had difficulty forming a clear view of the characters early on. It took me some time to figure it out, dazzled as I was by the nostalgia rushing through my system: they are stereotypes. The reclusive loner. The so-punk-it-hurts snarky girl who helps the protagonist \\"level up\\" at relationships by accepting her despite her one small flaw. The jock. The honorable Japanese character. Cline misses a big chance to make up for this by turning his villains into generic \\"Bob Evils\\" of \\"Evilcorp\\" stand-in company IOI. We learn that the antagonist once designed video games, but see no hint of how he went from a benign game designer to a soulless murderer. Lost opportunity there.<br /><br />Unfortunately, pacing presents a problem. Geek mind was pleased with a perceived brisk pace, and wanted to tear right through it. It's tough to give a book bad marks for pacing when that occurs, except Cline stops the show almost every time a pop culture reference comes along, offering a detailed explanation. This might have been meant to help the younger readers, but it murders the pace.<br /><br />Then we have the plot: it spoke right to my geeky soul. From the book title itself (a reference to the arcade games of my youth) to the numerous 80s film and music references, the author knows his subject matter well and wears it like a badge of honor. He does an okay job of weaving it into the narrative, barring the examples above. I'm also a sucker for a well-done quest plot. This book delivers on the quest plot, big-time. The romance is bland. I never cared for the cardboard cutout that was Art3mis, so it just never connected. The EvilCorp subplot, unfortunately, hit ludicrous levels even for my geek brain, and would have cost it a star even from that point of view.<br /><br />Writer Brain agrees on the quest plot, but the 80s references? Pandering. Pure and simple. They're not even well done, with some just being pure name drops, a wink and a nudge intended to make me like the book - it's an easy emotional note to play, using the reader's nostalgic emotions as a crutch for the characters' emotions, which are difficult to access. Then there are the ludicrous plot contrivances, especially Parzival's \\"grand plan\\". No spoilers here, but you'll know it when you see it and it may drive you mad. Cline clearly painted himself into a corner and found a very far-fetched way out of it using magic tools never-before-mentioned. This happens in other places in the book, like a teenager becoming interested in and thoroughly studying the culture from six decades previous, but this is particularly egregious.<br /><br />So, we have the cons: relying too heavily on nostalgia, ridiculous plot contrivances, flat characters, and uneven pace. Then come the pros: a story that keeps you reading, a well-done quest plot, and - from my geeky perspective - feeding of the nostalgic urge. Thus, I recommend this book with several caveats. One, you absolutely must have a connection to the 80s. This must come across as a very hollow book without that connection. Two, if you have that connection, it should be a connection of the geekier stripe. Three, be prepared to turn your brain off and enjoy as it you would an action film. If you can do all of that, you might have a blast with it as I did, even while objectively knowing it's a bit iffy.out that was Art3mis, so it just never connected.

0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is an outstanding memoir of a child soldier fighting on the side of the army in the civil war of Sierra Leone. Ishmael Beah records an excellent account of his experiences as a child soldier and conveys his message informally in rich detail. This story is about Ishmael Beah's early teenage years when he was running away from the country's rebels, the R.U.F., his experience fighting against them and his time spent in a rehab center until he was adopted by his uncle. Beah was brainwashed to kill and became addicted to various drugs all while in the army. He killed countless rebels, escaped death a few times himself and lost his entire family. He was robbed of his entire childhood and his mind was corrupted. Towards the end of the book when Ishmael goes to stay at a rehabilitation center, he starts to regain his innocence again. He is starting to resist the urge to do drugs and to fight. The story ends with a great change to Ishmael's life when he is chosen to represent his country in a United Nations conference and eventually ends up escaping Sierra Leone and made his way to America. Most of the story is painful to read. The rebels and army fight each other mercilessly and most of the soldiers range from six to seventeen years old. All of their innocence is washed away and they live in very harsh conditions with marijuana and cocaine as their only method to gain mental stability.  Beah's memoir is very straightforward and does not go into much depth at all about his emotions during his gruesome struggle as if he is leaving it up to us to decide the severity of the situation. In Conclusion, it is a very touching story that is a must-read. Beah's memoir enlightens the dark side of the world that we usually don't hear about but we need to hear about.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|My mom took a mother's time and patience to buy me this Kelly Clarkson CD album. I'm really surprised to see Kelly's maturing adding her self esteem also! This still isn't the best album from Ms. Clarkson, I liked her \\"Breakaway\\" album most of all. It goes to \\"Breakaway\\", \\"All I Ever Wanted\\", \\"Stronger\\" and \\"Thankful\\" from great to not so great albums, no offense or anything.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was an excellent read.  I couldn't stop once I started and at the end, I immediately went and purchased the 2nd and 3rd in the series.  I fell in love with the characters and I felt like they were set up extremely well.  The action was well described and I felt like I was in the moment throughout the book.

B004EFYZ1C|1.0|After installing this on my HTC Thunderbolt running Android 2.3, the phone location was set to Chennai and changed time/date because of that. I tried to readjust to my home location (Seattle area) but no luck. I had to remove this app and restart the device. I don't know how this app works on other devices but avoid this if you have HTC Thunderbolt.    This speaks to the difficulty in making sure Android apps work across all the devices, OS versions.

B002VLP81M|5.0|I ordered the book brand new and it was! You could tell that it hadn't even been opened before. Two thumbs up!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The author suprised me again, made me feel frustration, pain and anguish.  I cried at parts and I found myself still conflicted about who the main character would ultimately choose.  The good guys end up being just as corrupt as the bad guys - excellet twist in my opinion.  I was a little disappointed in the end.  Through 3 books the personal struggles of Katniss and her \\"feelings\\" are built up to a point that I expected a greater moment of \\"realization\\" on her part.  Instead it felt like the choice was made for her.  She ended up with the guy that I think she really wanted, but there was no moments where the reader \\"knows\\" this.  I have to wonder what if the other guy remained and put up a little fight for her affection?  Would she have made the same choice?  I \\"think\\" yes, but I would love to have known for sure.  With that aside, I think this was still an excellent book and a great read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun game I love it. its sooo much fun I cant stop playing it I just got it to day to
B004HO6HWK|2.0|Movie was 'dry', not much to it, acting ok. The original wasn't that exciting, but it had more 'feel' and atmosphere to it than this does. They would have done better to just try and do an exact remake of the original.  This is a 1 time watch rental and nothing more.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I had fun with this app until ads started popping up. this app has too many random ads. In the middle of a game,ads for devil inside pop up.very annoying.

B0042RUMJG|5.0|This is a must-have product for Sting fans. It is a live recording of one (out of 130+) concerts given by Sting, and friends, while collaborating with local symphonies around the world. The video quality is stunning. The audio quality is near perfect and my only complaint was the slightly low audio level of female vocalist \\"Jo Lawry\\" during the duet \\"Whenever I Say Your Name\\". I counted 36 tracks on the Blu-ray which also contains bonus video interviews.<br /><br />[...]

B0063IH60K|1.0|I put solitaire on my Kindle Fire because I LOVE the game. It's a free ap, but beware of HORRIBLE ads that pop up on your device even when you are not using the Solitaire Application!!! For the last few days I've had an issue with a movie trailer popping up on the screen when i was using my device. Then the virus-like software hijacks your other apps and folders to use. It took a while to figure out what was going on, but after a little digging I have found a LOT of other people with the same issue.  I had to delete the app and all my settings to get the horrible virus-like application off my device!!! I will NOT ever get another app from this company again!!! If there was a way to rate it with a ZERO I would!!!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|My order arrived quickly. The Dvd's were in great shape and have so far been great to watch. thanks so much!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It is a fun game for all of us!  We like all the different games to choose from.  There is something for everyone.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good for my ADD but not original or challenging, really. I appreciate not having to actually buy points or whatever for a &quot;free&quot; game, however.
B006OT03BM|3.0|I loved the first two movies. The third one would have benefited from killing off that skinny girl with the pink lipstick. I am tired of having to pay for a DVD version and a digital copy when all I want is the Blu Ray. I got a TV and Blu Ray player that just happen to be 3D. Not why I bought them but I wouldn't mind the 3d versions of these and other movies. But the price is ridiculous.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun time waster. download if you have nothing to do. there are actually a 101 games. they get addicting. the games low quality, but still fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|enjoyed the games. fun and challenging to have to work to unlock more games. could do.without so many ads though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is really easy to use and I love to play it! thanks for allowing this app to be free!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm totally addicted to this game. all I need is a little music and I'm good to go. kudos to whoever invented this game. I love it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not too bad for a bunch of mini games. sometimes controls leave something to be desired. wish each game would unlock after you beat the previous
B001LMU182|5.0|this is probably my favorite movie of all time and i wanted to watch it in japanese for once but i realized its the same damn thing there saying in english not a direct translation of the japanese script. so if you like the english dub then this blu ray movie is for you it looks fantastic way better than the dvd.  buy this movie you cant go wrong (unless you cant stand the english dub).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|entertaining and keeps u busy..time goes by pretty fast..you'll find yourself trying to get more and more points in order yo unlock a new game.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Seriously! If you need to kill time, or you are bored, or maybe you just love mini-games. Either way you are going to love this App!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great ap.  It is a great way to pass time. I really enjoy the variation in the games.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games... weird controls... too many ads... could be better but i like it... its entertaining though so that's good...
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I was pretty surprised at this book, after having it recommended to me multiple times and looking over the ratings, I had pretty high expectations.   That may have been the problem.  The story is interesting, offering a unique slant on a standard tale. The writing REALLY needs a good editor though, someone who will catch the missing word (or 100), someone who will help tamp down repeated phrases (\\"he/she put his/her hands on each side of her/his face\\" - I think I read that at least 60 times), and who above all, will help tighten the writing overall. This is not really one story, it's about 15 different stories about the same couple. Each time I thought it was ending, I'd look and realize I was nowhere near.  Thankfully the stories were compelling enough to keep me reading, but I did find myself pretty confused at the motivations of the characters off and on throughout. Often times, the behavior seemed forced and the rationale for that behavior was only offered as an afterthought (the main character remaining broken up with the guy after he fixed the problem (for that break-up) is one example of this).  I think I might have felt better if the book had been called a series of short stories. There's just so much happening in this!  I will probably check back for the author in the future, as there was surely some potential, but I'm hopeful that she has a better editor next time around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the sample before buying the Kindle edition, but the plot was so moving and suspense-filled that I just couldn't put it down. Just completed it, and what do I have to say about it? Money well spent.  The plot is well-thought off by the author and the book is great. Its very tough to put it down, and after completing it, I'm being pushed by myself to buy the next in the series, just because the story ends with many unanswered questions!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun but boring. only good once in a while. kind of annoying. I don't really recommed it. but its free so fl ahead.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Great movie I was not expecting for it to be so good. A bit sad in a way but very uplifting at the end.It give new meaning to the word hope. It will be a golden classic ...AJ
B003OFVIXG|5.0|Love this!  Saw the song Les Passants on one of Stana Katic's (from ABC's Castle) Tweet.  Decided to check out the other stuff on the cd and loved it!  Great voice and love the music.  It is all in French but you can easily look up the lyrics online to translate.  I took French through high school and college and was in search of some good modern French music.  This is it with an oldfashioned twist. Definatley should check it out!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Such a pain in the rear not recognizing my location &amp; giving me stats for some place in PA.  Gave up, uninstalled, &amp; opted for Weather Channel.app which works wonderfully well &amp; is also free.  Don't waste your time unless you want to know what the weather's like 1000 miles away AND you want to try to tweak it yourself.
B005OGYH90|5.0|This is a excellent album/DVD. Slash just seems to know the essence of good rock music. If you were a fan of the original Guns & Roses , Velvet Revolver or his solo album then this is a must buy.  Maybe someone should send Axl a copy just so he knows what he is doin wrong .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I find this a really great game it sucks having to earn up points to open a new game sometimes. but overall. very good
B003ASLJK4|5.0|This movie makes me cry every time. I love how it seems so realistic and the ending is just so amazing.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is great.  I play it in waiting rooms it passes the time and is really a lot of fun.  It makes waiting for the doctor almost a pleasure!
B0063GORYU|5.0|UPDATED REVIEW: It looks like the company fixed the obnoxious movie-trailer problem so I am revising to give it five stars. I really like playing this game.<br /><br />*******************************************<br /><br />I love card and solitaire games, and this had been one of my favorites. I say \\"had\\" because just today it started doing something that makes me hate it. All of a sudden, and apparently at random, while playing this game I will be abruptly taken away from the game to a screen where a trailer for the movie \\"The Devil Inside\\" starts playing.<br /><br />This is unacceptable. I know it's a free app, and with that I do expect ads ... but not in the middle of the game, for Cripes sake! Whoever thought this was a good idea should be looking for a different job.<br /><br />For what it's worth, this is happening on my Kindle Fire (or, I should say WAS happening because this app is G-O-N-E, gone now ... deleted). Too bad, cuz it's really a fun game.

His description of adventure travel to participate in the Worldloppet events makes me want to pack my skis and mix the joy of ski racing with different cultures.  This book is great reading for veteran Birkie skiers as well as those wondering about the \\"fever\\".

I broke down and bought 11.22.63 out of curiousity. I am back as a fan...I loved this book! I couldn't put it down, it read smoothly and easily. It gave me hope, took it away and gave it back to me. The story is wrapped around an event that many of us remember clearly and could relate to.   Thank you, Mr. King for your gift.  Lynda

B002ZG99QS|4.0|Twenty-eight years after Tron first hit cinema screen in 1982, the long awaited sequel Tron: Legacy finally saw the light of day. Given both the advances of special effects and the legacy (no pun intended) of the original film, Tron: Legacy found itself with a high set of expectations before it. Keeping both of those things in mind, how does Legacy stand up as a sequel to the original film?<br /><br />Let's start by looking at the two retuning cast members from the original film: Jeff Bridges and Bruce Boxleitner who both reprise their two roles from the original film. Bridges plays both Kevin Flynn and his digital avatar, the program named CLU. The Flynn of Legacy is quite different from the quirky everyman seen in the original film, this Flynn being more philosophic as well as having a dash of both Bridges' The Dude character and just a bit of Obi-Wan Kenobi thrown in for good measure. While that might make one think the character would be unrecognizable, just the reverse is true as Bridges presents a believable nevertheless as a continuation of the character. CLU is, while wearing Flynn's face from the 1980s, is very much different as he has become a tyrannical ruler bent on creating what is perfection in his own eyes. Boxleitner reprises the roles of Alan Bradley and Tron, both of which are effectively extended cameo appearances but comes across as crucial to the film's plot. Both actors are able to reprise their younger roles thanks to a bit of digital de-aging that for the most part works incredibly well (though some of the shots of the younger Flynn are very noticeable due to the lighting). The result is a nice link back to the original film that nevertheless expands on the original character's.<br /><br />The majority of the cast though are new characters. Playing Flynn's now grown son Sam is Garrett Hedlund who, like Bridges in the original film, convincingly portrays a fairly normal person sent into a digital world. Outshining him to a certain degree is Olivia Wilde as the program Quorra whose performance perfectly captures what is effectively an innocent abroad character with an action film twist. It also helps that Hedlund and Wilde share a good deal of chemistry between them which helps the film out as well. Also appearing in the supporting cast is an almost unrecognizable Michael Sheen as Castor, James Frain as CLU's henchman Jarvis and Beau Garrett as Gem. The film is also full of countless supporting characters who appear for only a scene or so at a time but immensely help to sell the reality of the film's digital world. All together, the cast serves the film well which is always a plus.<br /><br />The production values of Legacy are worthy of note for a whole number of reasons. The original production values of Tron from its production design to its costumes and early CGI effects created a vision of a digital world iconic decades later. Iconic yet on the surface dated due to the limitations of 1980s technology. The biggest challenge that Legacy would face would be updating that world for a 21st century audience. In that regard, Legacy succeeds. The film takes the iconic elements of the first film such as the Lightcycles and disc battles but gives them a modern edge. Compare for example the \\"new\\" lightcycles with the \\"old\\" lightcycle seen later in the film. They're both light cycles but the \\"new\\" one has a less plastic feel to it, as if it's been streamlined down to basics. The same is true of the costumes which have the same silhouette but have been given both a dark coloring and the ability to emit actual light (rather than having it more or less pasted on afterwards). Legacy also has a lot more physical sets in its digital world, called \\"the Grid\\", which make it perhaps a more believable world with a solid feeling to it.  That isn't to downgrade what was done in the original film by any means of course but Legacy takes what was done there and, with nearly three decades of technological advancement, takes itup a level while still remaining true to it.<br /><br />Last but not least, is the plot and script for Legacy. The original Tron has fairly been called simplistic in terms of its plotting and the same can just as fairly be said about its sequel here. The film, minus some flashbacks, is set twenty-eight years after the original. Kevin Flynn, head of Encom and a man apparently on the brink of some breakthrough, disappeared in 1989. Twenty years later, with Alan Bradley now a relatively minor member of Encom's board and Flynn's son Sam largely uninterested in the company, a mysterious message sends Sam on a course onto the Grid. Legacy follows many of the same beats as the original film in terms of the order of sequences showing off different aspects of the digital world. That isn't to say that it is a rip-off by any means. Legacy, appropriately enough, deals with the theme of legacies throughout. In the real world, Sam and Alan are dealing with Flynn's disappearance twenty years on. The Grid is being directed by CLU towards some secret goal, which CLU hopes will allow him to once and for all overcome Flynn's legacy. Last but not least is Flynn himself who, with Sam's arrival, begins at long last a journey that will see him facing the consequences of actions in a world he has disconnected from. Like the first film, Legacy is a simple plot that embodies some sizeable ideas just beneath the surface.<br /><br />Where does that leave Legacy then as a sequel? The performances of both returning actors and new actors is on par with that seen in the original film, the production values and effects bring the iconic world of the original into the modern day and the script has the same fault as the original one did in being perhaps overly simplistic in terms of plot while harboring some intriguing ideas. I would argue that, quality wise, Legacy is on par with the original film in terms of pure enjoyment as a sci-fi adventure film. Whether it will be as iconic as the original though is something that only time will tell.ing true to it.  Last but not least, is the plot and script for Legacy.

B0000019P9|5.0|Jeff Mangum speaks to your soul, if you let him. This album is steeped in mystery and symbology, like getting a front-row seat to someone's half-awake dreamscape. This is a soundtrack for the twilight period before you fall asleep at night, a roaring anthem for human nature, a quiet sigh after seeing something tragic or beautiful happen in front of you. Possibly the most affecting album I've ever listened to. But it is definitely an acquired taste. Give it a chance, let it speak to you on a personal level. This is what music can be, this is what music can mean for people beyond top 40 pop and manufactured dance beats. Music can change your life and affect you in many different ways, and this album is the beachhead.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Bruce Wayne finds the Dark Knight with two distinctly different enemies; organized crime--the lifeblood of evil and \\"The Joker--a hideous criminal out for revenge against anyone because of facial disfigurement. On the good side Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman remain long time friends and mentors, and additionally, the police protagonist (Gary Oldman) and the mayor (Aaron Eckart). The female role that grew up with Bruce Wayne now favors the mayor and a new element, a high ranking Chinese criminal who convinces Gotham's crime families to centralize all crime money in Hong Kong.<br /><br />Just as Batman and the police close in on Gotham's banks the money is removed, leaving Gotham in a state of anarchy.<br /><br />What rises from the dust is \\"The Joker\\", and do not look for a Jack Nicholson type \\"Joker\\". This \\"Joker\\" (Heath Ledger) is different, credible and very persuasive.<br /><br />Moral issues between good and evil create a finer line for Batman to operate within. Is he a hero or a vigilante? Will evil swallow-up good?<br /><br />Never say never until you have seen \\"The Dark Knight\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app has so much games and they are so fun. I love this app.You should get this app it's a good use of your space on you device.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|This is a great addition to the musical DVD collection I have. Taylor Swift is such an incredible entertainer and really puts forth her animation and desire to include her audience in each song she sings.  I enjoyed watching Taylor bring her best to every performance depicted in this tour.  Definitely worth the money as you will enjoy watching it over and over again. Very pleased with this purchase.
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|Great product! We love this new movie! My family was very excited to watch it. Smurfs were back from when we were kids...70's and 80's and to show it to our children now was wonderful. Great comeback.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I got this for my husband as a Christmas gift, and it's been a huge hit!  If you're expecting an actual Sonic Screwdriver replica, this isn't it.  It's plastic, it's obviously a toy, but if you get it with that understanding, it's awesome!  My 4 year-old loves to run around the room \\"fixing\\" things with the Sonic Screwdriver.  In fact, he almost loves it as much as my husband does!  My one big complaint about it is that the pen nib comes off WAY too easily.  This was easily fixed, however, with a small dab of hot glue at the base.  Then, if we want to swap it out, we can just pull it off since hot glue comes off under pressure.  We've had to do the same with the screw cover on the slider button, as well, since that has started falling off, too.  If you love Doctor Who, or know someone who does, this is an definite win.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this as a small present for my little brother and so far it has worked excellently. Came in a great packaging and I received it super fast thanks to Amazon's super fast shipping.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This is a dark, intense, moving love story about two very different people who are attracted to each other from the start.  Christian has some pretty awful things in his past, although we don't have the whole picture.  He knows Ana is too innocent for him, but can't seem to stay away from her anyway.  There are some BDSM elements and this is an erotic story, which I don't ususally read, but the focus is on the relationship.  Can they make it work?  Can she give him what he needs and still be true to herself?  There are some lighter moments as well.  I enjoyed the e-mail banter. I could not put this down and need the next book immediately.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are okay, they can do better with the selection.. I like that they give you points for trying..
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great!  I love the fact that it can be narrated so that I can listen along.  Highly recommend the reading plans.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are all very simple and entertaining. Surprisingly addictive and a great way to pass the time.  As you play each game you earn points to unlock new ones. Some games have much higher replay value.
B000E5N684|5.0|has some juicy things that i never saw on the others.. i love this movie and wish there was a #3.  !!  has everything you want in a good mystery.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great and easy to set up. There is some lag when using 3G and 4G but nothing major. Sometimes it doesn't register all keyboard input but just try different ones.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|wakes u up when needed when your not around a alarm clock. great so now don't need to spend extra money on an alarm clock when you got one right here:)
B006RUJST6|5.0|READ THIS BOOK!  I wondered about the title but now I totally understand!  I laughed, I cried, I felt like I was \\"Lake\\" and I NEVER  knew how this book would end, until the very end.  I had my hopes and suddenly a twist would work it's way in and I would find myself saying out loud \\"UGH\\".  Not being able to put the story down, I read until I found out the ending, the same day I started this book.  My eyes were getting tired but I HAD to know what was going to happen~~~  I hope there is a sequel in the works.
B005K8QIS0|5.0|\\"Case Histories\\" satisfies on all levels -- characters, actors, stories, mystery and more. This is one of the best detective series ever! The main guy, Jackson Brodie, is played by Jason Isaacs, the actor who also did the smarmy, hideously good-looking and house-elf kicking Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series. Isaacs' acting is so good in \\"Case HIstories\\" that at first I had trouble identifying him. (It wasn't just that he wasn't wearing Malfoy's Prince Valiant blonde wig. He is one of the finest actors of the 21st century; he is the roles he plays.)  Could \\"Case Histories\\" improve in any way? Yes, very occasionally the script meanders a bit. I would shorten it. But, even with this criticism, It's a superb series, and I'm glad I bought it.  .
145551389X|5.0|Amazing book, amazing photos, excellent quality and it is totally worth the money!   I'm from Brazil, and the book arrived in perfect conditions. If you like/love/live for Gaga, you should totally buy it!

B002LFAHBO|5.0|Has a couple of short R rated scenes and a little R rated language but overall a fantastic Christmas movie.  Probably not suitable for small children but great for family with older teens.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game that I've ever played!!!!! I could do it all day!!!!:) The reason I like this game is because it has so many games on it and its free plus its super cool
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is an amazing show!! I bought the first 3 seasons. It provided tons of fun and laughter. The DVDs arrived earlier than expected. I ordered the set during the Christmas holiday. Must buy!!!
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I received this Marware cover along with my Kindle Fire as a gift a couple months ago, and I couldn't be happier with it. The case fits snugly over the Fire, and it never feels as though my device could pop out of the protective case even when accidentally dropped. Although it's a lightweight case, it provides excellent protection for my device, particularly for the corners which are often the first victims of chips and breaks.<br /><br />The only criticism I might have is the depth of the slot in which the foldable \\"stand\\" fits....perhaps it could be a bit deeper to make the stand more stable. As other reviewers mentioned, I found that the stand worked better after I had broken the foldable section in a bit, as it was quite stiff when I first opened the case. I also had a heck of a time removing my Fire from the case the first time I put it on and then tried to remove it. Again, this was just a matter of \\"breaking in\\" the case, and I do suggest that you give it a chance to loosen up a bit with use....it will, but will still hold your device securely.<br /><br />I think the price of this case is a bit high (currently about $30), considering it's only a piece of plastic and felt. At the same time, the first time you drop your device on the floor and find it still safe and sound inside this case, you'll be happy that you made the investment!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I found this complex modern mystery very had to put down.  I loved how it was almost two stories in one book that comes together in the middle.  It has a bit of adult content so it might not be for the younger crowd but a very good book.  It is the first of a trilogy, so I have but the next book on my reading list.  Netflix has the English subtitle movie of the book and there is a new English version coming out in theaters soon.  I plan to watch both and compare.
3836501910|4.0|You might be surprised when you start looking through this collection of photographic works. It is a little porno and maybe not to be left on the coffee table for certain guests. There are some interesting works. I would have preferred more non-sexual subject matter, but still appreciate the talent and creativity.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|only complait is it reloads often, and  that is frustrating. when it reloads you have to find your spot again
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good app. It has some games that I really enjoy. However, I really don't like all the ads.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is very very very addictive! it is the best game that I have. I like this game a lot.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is awesome for the Fire!! I saw the video demonstration for it, and loved seeing the bright colors, and sort of reminded me of Pong for Atari, and yes, I know I am dating myself for that game. But in ways of simplistic and colorful and just plain fun to play. Its not so easy that you get bored with it and say \\"Why did I even bother paying for this?\\", you wind up saying \\"Glad I did pay for this!\\" because it can get to be a fast past game, which is a nice change of pace.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|it drains battery but can be very useful and has many great features for something free. the fact that it drains so much battery looses my interest although I cant complain about everything especially because it is a free app. if there were a 2 1/2star space,  that is whet this would earn.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is great for passing time and my little sister loves to play it. It is quite fun and there are many different. games, perfect for big takers.
B005HSL626|5.0|its &quot;woo&quot; fun, you'll love it, I got it for my kindle fire, and I love it!!! you get to slice fruit and unlock super cool blades.
B001HN69B8|5.0|Great movie.  Absolutely love this movie.  I think it is underrated.  If you like fantasy movies with a bit more you will love this.
B005WM6RUS|5.0|I have looked at this book many times before finally picking it up and reading it. I was avoiding reading about another horrifying event surrounding the Nazis and innocent Jews being murdered during WWII.  However, I picked it up at the library and after the first couple of pages was hooked.  I checked out this book yesterday and finished it tonight.  Could not put it down!  The intertwining of the past with the present was done superbly by the author.  It was so easy to get drawn into both story lines and wondering how they'd ultimately become connected.   The historical aspect of this story cannot be ignored.  It is a tragedy.  But it is one that not many know about, and I'm so glad this author put it in her novel.  I will not go into details.  The novel speaks for itself and I don't need to tell any plot details to \\"draw in\\" prospective readers.  Just simply - read it!!  You will not be able to put it down.  You will not forget this one!!
0061120073|5.0|An easy and heartfelt read, so well written. So relevant across all times, to all sorts of people. Francie is an amazing character that anyone can relate to
B004GUSG4M|2.0|In short- I had the ending figured out early on, the repetitiveness of the amnesiac and her journal was mundane. I was really hoping this was a real 'thriller'.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|I think this album was worth buying. I am a huge fan of Nickelback and found every track a worth while addition to thier arsinal of already powerful rock sound. Definatly recommend it for the die hard fan like myself.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My kids play this on my Kindle Fire and it keeps them occupied for hours.  So I can't speak to anything but the fact that there is no graphic violence,it's cute and entertaining. Also the music is not annoying, which is a refreshing change.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game is very well done but very addictive.  Response could be a little better but this is a minor issue.  Great game play and good graphics.
0307946711|3.0|I was really excited to read One Day and then watch the movie (which I still haven't gotten to), and, ultimately, the book was pretty good. Emma and Dex felt like real characters and real people who could actually exist. Now, living in America, there was a slight language barrier. The jokes and some of the terminology they used went over my head, but it didn't detract too much from the book. In the beginning, Emma and Dex meet and have a one night stand. After that, Nicchols begins describing their lives, on that same day July 15, every year after 1988. The banter the two have is quite witty, but the first few years Nicchols describes are too long. At the end of the book, the sections are very short, maybe even a little too short. But, because the beginning sections were so long, it almost felt like a relief. I read this with three other friends and we all had different opinions about Dex who we called a charmer, flirt, bastard, pig, sweet guy, well intentioned, lazy, etc. And Emma was smart, boring, unadventerous, not willing to take risks, sensible, \\"right\\" and many other things. It's a fun experience, but the beginning parts are lengthy. If you can get through them, it's a worthwhile read.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works like a charm.  I can edit and even print my Word and Excel docs, etc without having to lug a laptop around.  Does not work if computer is off, our even sleeping, though.  Would like to allow my computer to sleep, and have this app wake it up, saving on electricity costs etc.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like how the game uses some of the old school games we all had I think when I have kids I will definently show them this app
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like it but it kicks out randomly and opens a web page so it seems like some sort of bug.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Lots of fun to play! No problems! Runs great! Highly recommend! All good things to say about this app. Runs perfect on kindle fire.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Works out great on the HP Touchpad. Finds your location automatically to show local conditions. Even has high quality imagery.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is an amazing tool, you can have it at your fingertips!!! The ability to share the Word of God with others is as easy as pulling out your Kindle. It really is amazing.
B003L77FYS|5.0|We like the chemistry between the all of characters and how the different events navigate through all of the related stories.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Its a &quot;who dunnit&quot; game mixed with hidden objects. I love it! Hours of endless play!  I recommended this game to my mom, who loves hidden object games and my son loves to find ojbects also.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game I am really enjoying it.  I am really only writing this to get the game points that the game offered . but this is a fun game to pass the time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It annoyed me at first, because I couldn't figure out the games, but after a few minutes, I liked it.    Its a great time killer, and addicting.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|My niece's daughter loves this movie.  I hadn't seen it for a very long time but it was fun to revisist and watch how the kids today react to the craziness of it all.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have reason to believe this app ruined my messaging on my EVO 4G it said it was malicious and it ruined my messaging and wouldn't not let me open it so I had to hard restore it and EVERYTHING got deleted could've been this app or a different one I'm JS becareful
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love using this app to track everything. I can access from phone, kindle fire and Pc when I need the info it is at my fingertips.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|an amazing game, or actually one hundred and seventeen amazing game. it is also free shock surprising from such a great app. I cannot think of anything to change.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is jam packed with fun for all ages.It is easy to earn points and a lot of them.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Shipping was very speedy,, and the DVD is as-new. I'm extremely pleased with the service I received. This is a very sweet story, and has great appeal for both young and old viewers. I highly recommend Up!!
1594744769|3.0|This book hooked me with the chilling cover and sparse information on the back. Thumbing through it, I was amazed to see all the weird photos in it. When my wife bought it for me for Christmas and I started reading it, I soon became disappointed. The book is meant for teenagers, a fact that I had not picked up on. While the prologue starts off splendidly, the rest of the story is simple, with simple writing and simple themes throughout. While the adventure of the book isn't horrible, it's hard to thoroughly enjoy the book when nearly everything that happens is telegraphed. The dull moments tend to outweigh the exciting ones, and halfway through the story, I was more interested in finishing it than \\"discovering\\" what happens to the characters.<br /><br />Mind you, I am an adult and was fooled by the cover of the book. I don't think the book is horrible when aimed at it's intended audience, but I haven't been a highschooler for a few years. The photographs interspersed throughout the book are amazing, and I truly love the concept of the book. It brings the media to an entirely new level. This review isn't to bash the author's work, so much as it is to warn other readers that if you are anticipating a dark mystery that will keep you up at night, you will be disappointed.
1451648537|5.0|Just as the Buffet biography (2008) is a classic for investors, \\"Steve Jobs\\" is a classic for the high tech and the creative crowd.  You get a real sense for how difficult it must have been to work for Steve,  yet how special and rewarding the experience must have been.  The reader gets a history of the PC industry and an insight to the most amazing and \\"magical\\" person that made such a dramatic impact on so many levels and across so many industies. A great read that goes quickly in days and that leaves you wishing there was more. Walter, I wish it ran to 900 pages.  Also a gift that will be remembered for a long time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Purchased game hoping it would be good to pass the time. I have not been disappointed. So, take the chance and enjoy as I have.
B005K17RU0|4.0|nice app. dose what it says. weather is accurate. radar is nice. I wish it would have a locate op.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|I saw this new movie, \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" without having read John le Carre's novel on which it is based or without seeing the previous adaptations of the book. The details of the plot proved difficult to follow, and I was quickly confused. The manner of the presentation, with many flash-backs, did not make understanding any easier.<br /><br />There are positive things about the film as well. The movie captures the atmosphere and the spirit of palpable tension in the Cold War era of the early 1970's through its portrayal of tough, yet beaureaucratic espionage agents, out of the way hotels and homes, high glamor, and violence. The settings in London, Budapest, and Russia are shown effectively and realistically.  Gary Oldman gives a strong performance of the intelligent, tight-lipped and perceptive George Smiley as the lead character.<br /><br />The story involves a Soviet mole who is placed in the upper reaches of British intelligence. The movie opens well as a British agent is ordered to Hungary to receive the name of the mole from a high-placed official. The mole, however, leaks the plan to the Soviets and the agent meets his death. George Smiley, who had earlier been fired, is recalled to service to learn the identity of the mole. The film moves well, for its 130 minute duration, and individual scenes are good. But the story, and the manner in which Smiley uncovers the turncoat, eluded me.<br /><br />My understanding is that the movie greatly compressed and changed le Carre's novel. Even though the movie is lengthy, essential elements of the story were cut. The movie probably will be best appreciated by viewers who have read and enjoyed le Carre's novel because they will have some prior understanding of the story and where it is going. A movie should stand on its own, however, and be intelligible to viewers who have not read the book on which it is based. Although there was a good deal to like in this film, it left me unconvinced and bewildered.<br /><br />Robin Friedman
B0063GORYU|5.0|Loved the game,hated the pop-up ads that sometimes interrupt my game.  If I wanted a different game, I would have bought it. Your ads are too invasive.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|The moon has always fascinated me. This app lets me enjoy the moon even more fully.  The only thing I would change is, I wish I could share directly on Facebook.  Also, I wish Kindle Fire would let you set your own wallpaper.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I cannot describe how much I adore this show. I have seen it probably 3 dozen times (no joke) and I can't get over it. All of the characters couldn't be more perfect. I don't want to give anything away for those who haven't seen it but are looking to. And if you watch it make sure that you watch Serenity the movie. It's explains all the loose ends that Joss Whedon didn't get a chance to tie up. I will recommend this show to anyone a billion times over.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game! it is awesome how you can play all different games on one app. my favorite one so far is the dart game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my younger brother and sister enjoy playing this game. great for little kids. keeps them busy. also runs well on Kindle fire
B002SF9YNO|5.0|This is a movie about acceptance. The protagonist was a cellist, and lost his job in a symphony at the city. He went home to his birthplace, a small town, and accepted a job as a person that prepared the dead (put clothes and make-up) for burial. Its a thankless job that the Japanese society disdains. Though the job paid well, the antagonist felt ashamed and had to hide his job from his wife and his childhood friends which in turn generated plenty of comic and tragic situations. In seeking resolution to his childhood and new dilemmas, the protagoist finally received the ultimate enlightment by preparing his long-lost deceased father for burial. This is a very well-done movie, it trancends all cultural boundaries because who hasn't in life that hasn't seek understanding and acceptance from our fellowmen for our own thoughts and actions. This is the reason why it received the BEST FOREIGN PICTURE OF THE YEAR at the 2008 Oscar.
B0063GORYU|3.0|good app. works decently. I play pretty often. the way it takes me away from the game for ads is sometimes annoying, otherwise I like it just fine.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|We ordered this hoping to make it before Christmas ... it did not make it, but it did help us extend the Holiday Christmas Season arriving soon after! Great package in new condition unopened and at a great price too!
B002VPE1WK|3.0|Although it holds my Nikon D2X with a 70-200mm lens attached and zips up...The bag is ideal for owners with D/SLR cameras WITHOUT vertical grip and small amounts of accessories.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- No famous brand name (such as Lowepro, Tamrac, Aktiv, etc.) embroidered on the bag which is a great theft deterent - just \\"Amazon\\" on the zippers!<br />- Full of padding inside and also on the shoulder straps.<br />- Easily configurable sections.<br />- Does not feel and does not look cheaply made.<br />- Great for carrying small equipments.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Could use a rain cover feature - perhaps if a newer model is in the works!<br />- I feel if my bag is bumped with my D2X is inside, it might damage the top (dome part) of the camera in front of the hotshoe (I just have to be careful).<br />- If you have several flash similar to the size of Nikon SB-800 or Canon brand, you can't store the flash(es) upright - you have to lay it flat, hence taking up more room.<br />- Not great for carrying all equipments.<br /><br />Bottom line...I recommend it for photographers who are just starting out. This bag is not ideal for photographers who has all of the photographic accessories such as multiple flashes and lenses, etc.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is okay but some games are really hard and difficult.to figure out. the points thing is fin though, it.makes you want to keep.going.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app has everything. but I think its so great that it should be $0.99 but than it's. great being free. I love 101-in 1 gamed its so fun if you don't have this game you should get it now.

014312093X|1.0|I was SO excited to read this book after all of the build-up to the movie. I thought it was going to be one of those monumental undiscovered reads for me. I'm up to page 185, and I have absolutely NO idea what is going on. The worst part is, I don't even care. There is virtally zero character development. Not sure if that is because they are supposed to be cloaked in the secret spy world of if it's just poor writing. I thought it was just me, but I'm relieved to see that some other reviewers feel the same way. I'm one who will try at all costs to finish a book out of a sense of obligation to it, but I'm really having a hard time with this one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a fun game but it can be hard. No adds wouldent hurt ether. I personly like it very much, but  some games I just don't get! When I first got the game I played for about 50 min. strate! But it started to get hard to earn enough points to open more games. other than that, I would recommend this game:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome you can play so many games to play so play it now now now now now. its great.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Pretty fun app. A little buggy with the controlls. Took some tome getting used to but eventually figured it out.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the whole thing is just plain awesome and the graphics are really cool because the picture is really crisp and clean
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very cool! it was awesome how you could unlock different games by winning certain games! keeps the kids entertained for a long time! lol
B006FTCH2E|2.0|This movie drew me in with its title. I remember seeing a trailer in the theater too that seemed to play up the other Earth aspect. It's barely a part of the movie and has little purpose. If you took Earth-2 out of this movie, you wouldn't really miss it. At it's heart this movie is an artsy independent film about sad people being sad. Lead character Rhoda feels bad that she drove drunk and killed some man's wife and child. I already forget his name and I just watched it a few hours ago. He's the stereotypical mess living in his filth wasting his life away in front of a Nintendo Wii and drinking too much. There's nothing new here. Students of psychology and sociology may debate over the nature, motivations, and feasibility of Rhoda's romantic relationship. It seemed cliche and a step too far for reality to me.<br /><br />Needless to say this is not a science fiction movie really, so if you are considering watching it in hopes that it may be, you've been warned. It's in there to a limited extent but it's just scenery. We never know why it's there, where it came from, why it keeps getting closer, what happens when the people of the two worlds interact face-to-face. We don't see the space voyage, which is one of the running plot lines. Imagine watching Contact without any actual contact. It's anti-climactic. And no one ever questions the increasingly close proximity of the two Earths. They seem destined for collision, but there's no concern from anyone.<br /><br />The movie drags in several places. There are passages of silence that I think were suppose to seem deep but weren't. I ended up browsing the web while pushing myself through the final 30 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />There is decent acting in spite of the weak script. The scene when Earth made first contact with Earth-2 was creepy and exciting (from the perspective of a science fiction fan), but there was little follow through on what that meant on the greater scale. The final seconds of the film caught my attention and then sadly it just ended, once again failing to deliver.<br /><br />I also questioned why no one cared that Rhoda gave away her trip to Earth-2. She won the contest for a reason and it wasn't to give her ticket away. If I was the person running that contest that would have been against the rules.<br /><br />I gave this film two stars, because it does have a few interesting moments. Overall, however, it tries too hard to be too artsy and philosophical with a cliche emotional drama, quiet moments, and ultimately no payoff. You can see the ending of this movie approaching faster than Earth-2.just ended, once again failing to deliver.   I also questioned why no one cared that Rhoda gave away her trip to Earth-2.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|If you want to save your Kindle Fire from the scratch and dent section of your garage sale you're going to have in 2017, get this case.  It's light, durable, and doesn't add a ton of bulk or make obnoxious statements about your personal preferences.  It is well designed and noticeably lacking any sort of Hello Kitty, faux Louie Vitton type of covering that screams \\"I've got a Kindle Fire, but most likely I won't be using it to enrich myself intellectually\\".  If you're on the fence about which case to get for your Kindle Fire and you appreciate simple, well designed things, this is the case for you.
1426308469|5.0|this book was a gift for one of our grandsons and he loved it and promised to treat it gently!! the popup pics were just amazing,all the graphics excellent!

B003Y5H5BU|3.0|An alien vs. earth film that doesn't take place in L. A. Two software developers go to Moscow to present their software only to discover the Russians already have an exact copy. Unfortunately the beginning and their talents don't factor later into the film. They meet a couple of other Americans at a nightclub and when it looks like they are going to score aliens attack the planet (story of my life).<br /><br />These are not ordinary aliens. They are mostly invisible and like Predator seem to hunt by infrared. They kill humans and barking dogs using some kind of microwave beam that causes living things to explode (the cool part). Our focus group of 5 young adults hide in a large storage closet that has food.<br /><br />Now what? Do you A) stay put until all the food is gone, then maybe venture out to get more food, hoping that the aliens have killed enough humans. And if captured all they would want to do is probe you?<br /><br />or B) Try to find the US embassy so they can get you back home. Personally I would go with \\"A\\" because I know for a fact the US embassy does not have contingency plans for an alien invasion. Perhaps they need to advertise that more.<br /><br />** mid point Plot SPOILER? but not ending**<br /><br />Our group chose option \\"B\\". Later they discover the aliens can be killed with a \\"Ghost Buster\\" looking weapon and there is a Russian sub in the river awaiting survivors...but not for long. They meet people along the way. They gain a few and lose a few.<br /><br />To be honest I got a bit bored during the alien hide and seek part. There were no monsters to see, so they saved a ton of money on make-up and special effects. I didn't feel much intensity. The acting was okay considering the lack of a script. They needed to add a little humor, maybe a love scene with an \\"exploding\\" ending.<br />Asylum dull.<br /><br />2 f-bombs. No sex, or nudity. Some hip-hop song lyrics were suggestive.
0316098329|5.0|I ordered this for a book club I belong to. The book arrived very quickly. I am always impressed with how quickly I get my products through Amazon.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Excellent book.It had a similar taste of Lost Hero. Percy looks way more powerful compared to himself in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series.
0060935464|5.0|I just reread this as an adult and parent now living in the Deep South. It is so profound. I was inspired to do so upon seeing  the bumper sticker \\"What would Atticus do?\\" While I am glad that this book has remained on the required reading list at many American middle and high schools, don't miss reading it as a adult. You will realize just what an amazing person Atticus Finch really was.

B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I like the Conan fiction but this movie is still terrible. Unfortunately its loaded with bad acting and most scenes lack context due to ridiculous editing. This movie is WAY more accurate to the original graphic novel of Conan than the movie with Arnold in it but the Arnold one is way more entertaining. At least it kept it simple and on point. this movie jumps all over the place, has no risk of loss or even unexpected turns. Cliche` is a good term for all the action and drama in this movie.<br /><br />It's to bad because there was real potential for a fun and engrossing movie here that Hollywood just destroyed.

B005H5H3LW|5.0|This was a great movie with many simularities but yet many differences from the original Japanese cartoon. I group the old and new \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" in a simular fasion in which the old and new share commonalities but yet differences which both do not share, like the Cylons, ships, some characters, and the way the show played out. So when viewing this movie don't expect every detail of the cartoon to shine through. Although you will see things you remember from the old you will also see things you did not expect. This is a refreshing movie that is very well done and had enough action to keep you glued to the television. The special effects were fantastic and the plot was very well done. The english captions were a little corney at times but kept very short and to the point so viewing the film was easy. If I understood Japanese the dialog may have been better and more detailed. The film was in 5.1 as well. It was a great treat to see the story of Yamato come to life and I think this would have made a great series simular to \\"Star Trek\\" or \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" with the quality the show has, if the writers would have taken it in that direction. If you are going to pick apart and compare every facet to the old cartoon you will BE disappointed. If you are like myself and want to see the cartoon come to life and don't mind some changes you will NOT BE disappointed. I feel this is a must have for anyone who loves the Adventures of (Space Battleship Yamato) or (Starblazers). For the price of this DVD it is easy for you to decide. The only bummer is that you must watch all the ads before getting to the main menu and a few more when you actually play the movie.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|it is the best controller for people with small hands.  do not underestimate this controller it is better than the (batrang) is you like simple elite things.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This really is the best Android game title I've played.  I spent many, many, MANY hours killing zombies with this and even after beating it, I still pick it up from time to time.  It's worth every penny.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Love the game- it's challenging and fun- I'd rate it a 5 star, but it has a habit of strutting down in the middle of a game- once this gets fixed, it'll be great!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|there are alot of adds but the games are fun. some of the games get boring but some are really fun.
B0063IH60K|1.0|l played this game less than 2 mins, and I was taken out of it so many times. There were pop ups every couple seconds, took me to google.com several times and showed the movie a couple times. HORRIBLE...

B006IGZWB2|3.0|The movie was entertaining and true to the book.  Like any adaptation, it did not get into the emotional backstory as much but it was still sufficient for the viewer to follow along.
0439023521|5.0|I enjoyed it right from page 1. Not my usual genre as I usually read realistic fiction but I recommend this book. One word of caution though- you can't read just book one.  It is a trilogy and it ends in a cliff hanger in book one. I am now reading bòok two to get answers to the unresolved plot in book one.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Great app. Very easy to use (user friendly). Wish there were a few more ways to customize (like awesome note for iphone).

B006INDMEE|3.0|I expected this movie to be good because the cast was excellent.  There was one casting flub and that was to cast Tom Wilkinson as Steven instead of David. Jessica Chastain gave a compelling performance and Sam Worthington was more interesting to watch than he was in Avatar.  The movie made the viewer acutely aware of the dangers of the character's surroundings from the beginning.  Because the director established the severity of the situation so well I expected the plot to be worthy of the suspense they tried to drum up.  Instead, the movie's one or two plot twists were unoriginal and lacked the excitement needed to get through the remaining half hour.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|I saw all the great reviews on the books in this series and thought, \\"Hooray!\\" I thought I had finally found a good fantasy series.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />The book starts out OK. The writing is mid-level. Not horrible, not great. Then, the plot twists begin. This book has the most disturbing themes I've ever read. Killing children for political reasons, incest by mutual consent, rape, and rule by the dumbest just to mention a few.<br /><br />I have never seen so many characters make so many stupid decisions. I don't know how the people in these books survived as long as they did with all the poor decisions they made.<br /><br />I made it all the way through this book by sheer stubbornness. I am still mad that I wasted my time on it. I actually started the second book in the series. It was even worse.<br /><br />If you like dark themes like porn, incest, rape, brutalization, and domination, then this is for you. Otherwise, I would totally bypass this series. I felt like I needed to take a shower every time I stopped reading this.
0393064476|4.0|A compelling rich account of paganism and Christianity woven around a pivotal figure at the time of the Renaissance. I learned very much about the challenges of preservation of written material especially up to Gutenberg's press.      The reader is taken through torturous routes rich with names & historical gems in ways that seem disorganized and not germane to the topic. No doubt the work of Lucretius is pervasive in the book but, I could not help feeling some irritation at what appeared to be digressions with rich detail that felt like stimulus overload.      But I've already recommended the book to my wife and son for its intellectual strength and rich vocabulary.

0316010669|4.0|The book \\"Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\" by Malcolm Gladwell covers the unconscious ability to make correct answers or reactions by trusting in instinct.  He wrote this book on the theory that a snap decision from a person can become a more accurate response compared to a well thought out conclusion.  Gladwell tries to prove his idea in an interesting way by presenting different occurrences in stories that involve the use of a gut-decision becoming more reliable in relation to evidence and thought.  He wants to demonstrate to us that we have the aptitude to use this sense in many situations but we just don't notice it yet.  Gladwell also clearly refutes his idea by saying that your unconscious decisions can most commonly be wrong when becoming sidetracked using emotions or facts to consider your final answer.<br /><br />Overall he wrote a good book by incorporating interesting stories with a well-written description of each to establish proof that his theory of unconscious judgments are correct.  I read through this book becoming more and more interested after each anecdote Gladwell described.  However, I may not be fully convinced that what he is trying to validate is true.  There were some problems that went through my head that were not very clear when reading Gladwell's book.  For example one of his goals for writing this book was to teach the reader how to notice these unconscious signs.  On the other hand, all he wrote about was different cases where people were correct when using snap judgments.  He never went into showing us how to recognize the signs ourselves.  Also with many of his stories he never went into excessive detail that could have otherwise been major factors proving why a person was instinctively right.  All together, Gladwell's book was an enjoyable read and I would definitely recommend this to others!
0380713802|2.0|I generally love the Bryson books-- A Walk in the Woods was great, I enjoyed \\"In a Sunburned Country\\", and I found A Short History to be both very entertaining and educational.  I had to struggle to make it through \\"Neither Here nor There\\".  The tone is generally whiny.  The adventures are generally not adventures at all.  The flashbacks to his backpacking are good on the whole but the \\"present day\\" stuff tends to be incredibly dry.  There is lots and lots of \\"I arrived in town.  Had a hard time finding a hotel room (or meal).  I finally did [and complain about price about 33-50% of the time].  I walked up and down some streets and then left town.\\"  The sidebar stories are more self-centered and less entertaining/educational.  I thought I'd get a good travelogue with some interesting sidebars and anectdotes on each of the locations.  I really didn't get much of that.    If you enjoy Bryson's good books, I'd avoid this one.  If you want to hear him complain about making a claim for lost travellers checks then this is the book for you.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I believe the developers of this game could not create a single good game so they bundled 117 of there bad games in hope to make one good one. I tried to give this app a chance only to figure out it is more frustrating than enjoyable there are better ways to waste time.

B004QSQML8|4.0|This movie was entertaining to watch (in a good way). Featuring the classic unicorns, fairys, and good vs. evil scheme, this is a great watch for any fantasy fan. It's a shame it didn't receive better. The best part about this movie? This movie was the main influence for the main developer at nintendo (i can't seem to remember his name at the moment) to create the basic story for the hit game \\"The Legend of Zelda\\". The game has fared very well and successful for 25 years, and if it wasn't for a unique movie such as this one, none of it would have been possible!

B000JML90Y|1.0|I have to admit, I'm astonished by the ease with which one can be fooled into thinking they've procured the full and legitimate content of Darwin's signature work. A couple of easy clues, though:  Darwin refers in this version to a diagram in chapter IV, to illustrate \\"The Probable Effects of the Process of Natural Selection Through Divergence of Character and Extinction, On the Descendants of a Common Ancestor.\\" This diagram is absent in this version, and this absence is what started me on the road to identifying this version as a fraud. I began to search for other editions of \\"Origins\\" to see if they included the diagram. And that search found not only that most versions did contain the diagram, but that the full text of this work ran to over 550 pages - twice as many as are included in this version.  I should also have known better than to have procured a free version. You truly do get what you pay for.  Be aware, as you look for a reliable version of the work, that there are many fraudulent versions out there. I won't go into detail on this, as this review concerns this specific version. But I can say that I've purchased a version that I am satisfied is a faithful rendering of the complete content. The ISBN number is 978-0-451-52906-0. It's the 150th anniversary edition, with an introduction by Julian Huxley. Still, don't take my word for it, and do your own due diligence.  There is another \\"150th anniversary\\" version with an introduction by Ray Comfort, who is a Christian prothselitizer. So be careful.  Hopefully this will prevent you from having to start reading the work again from the beginning, as I've had to do. But I'm glad to have figured it out and separated fact from fiction.
0446585025|2.0|I'm a fan of Ellen. I think she's funny. I read this book hoping to learn more about her and her life. I was sorely disappointed. This book reads like someone with ADD's mental musings. From talking about how her favorite chapter of all time is the tenth one to begging readers not to fall asleep while reading her. She roams all over the place with no real idea of what her destination is.  She's funny in real life so I hate giving this a negative review. However by the end of the book, I was rolling my eyes as she'd start on a tangent and would end up skipping to 3 or 4 paragraphs later when she'd finish it.

B003DT194G|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have watched it every time it came on TV.  I was happy to find it so I could buy it and have it so I could watch  it anytime I wanted too.
B0053VKP8S|3.0|First off let me just say that for the price I expected this product to be cheaply made. To my surprise it is made out of metal and is built very sturdy.<br /><br />I had bought this converter for a client because he had bought a newer TV that only has a digital coaxial audio output unlike his old TV which had a RCA analogue audio output. He is not technologically savvy and his receiver does not have modern connections such as the digital coaxial port, so I figured the best option would be to purchase a converter so he could still use his old receiver which he is more proficient at using. Unfortunately this box would mot work with his setup whatsoever. Tried every possible way the TV and receiver would allow but no luck. Both the power and locked lights would light up indicating that the unit should be working. Thinking that it might be the TV not sending a proper signal for whatever reason, I took the box back with me and tested it out on 2 more devices. Still did not work so I tried to exchange it but amazon would only let me do a return so I'm just going to return it. Shame because the quality of this product astounded me for how cheap it was when so many of the other converters were over the 50 dollar mark.<br /><br />((((((((Edit)))))))))) Jan 10,2012<br /><br />Forgot to mention that although this item was listed as a digital audio to analogue rca converter meaning it converts digital to analogue, the instructions that came with the device said that this device was meant to convert analogue to digital. Not sure why that it is but nonetheless the product did not work with digital to analogue.

For anyone who is having trouble getting into them, read the first book to page 100 and I promise that you will not be able to put them down.

0307949435|5.0|I've read many books about low-carbohydrate regimens, from Atkins to Eades to the long-out-of-print Stillman. This book doesn't really add any new ideas to what's already been written on the subject, but if you're at all interested in the science of restricting carbohydrates, you should get a copy of this book.<br /><br />What sets Taubes' book apart is the combination of compassionate tone and exhaustive scientific information. He provides overwhelming evidence that obesity is not caused by gluttony, lack of exercise, or \\"more calories in than out.\\" Yes, this is very counterintuitive, but before you dismiss it, you must review the literally hundreds of years' worth of evidence -- Taubes cites authors from the 1700s through present-day researchers.<br /><br />Gary Taubes has written a crucial work that shatters the view that obesity is a weakness or a moral failing, or that the overweight deserve condemnation. Instead, he puts weight regulation where it belongs, in the realm of science, not moral judgement.<br /><br />The evidence that excess weight is caused by a complicated combination of hormonal and genetic factors has been there for a long time. So has the evidence that the simplistic tactic of restricting fat and reducing calories is usually ineffective and sometimes dangerous to health. Low-fat, low-calorie diets were not considered beneficial until recently; Taubes explains how public health opinion shifted radically in the 1970s and 1980s, bringing about the \\"low-fat\\" fads of that era. And he reviews the evidence that such regimens caused more obesity and health problems than ever before.<br /><br />Taubes does provide a simple low-carb regimen for weight loss. It is very similar to the classic Atkins diet, which he freely acknowledges. For most people, this diet will be enough to guide them through a thoughtful trial of healthful low-carbohydrate eating. If you are looking for more thorough information on how to follow a low-carbohydrate diet, you may want to pick up a used copy of one of the Atkins books.

B002BWP49M|4.0|I have not read the books so I didn't know what to expect from the beginning of the end of this series. I was more disappointed in the choices the new director made rather than in the storyline. Has this director even SEEN the other movies because nothing flowed properly with this movie at all. All of a sudden the vampires can be in full sunlight and not sparkle even a little bit...why is that? There were plenty of full sun scenes and none of the vampires sparkled, not even a little body glitter...nothing.   The vampires makeup looked absolutely terrible this time. Seeing it at the theater made them look very pasty and sticky like their Mom's had packed on way too much grease paint for Halloween.   Their eyes...at the wedding many of the vampire guests had very freaky looking red eyes and none of the human guests noticed?? The Cullens eyes seemed to switch all the time from gold, to black to gold...no idea why. Had they forgotten their contact lenses on some days?   I also wasn't happy with the overly excessive use of music and staring...lots of staring set to music, it took the place of dialogue in many scenes. I didn't like the music selections this time, either. Very dull and forgettable. The other movies used music more appropriately and there were some very memorable, haunting songs that really stuck in your head. Not this time.   The funniest part of all, the wolves \\"talking\\". Not a good idea and I nearly laughed out loud when they began to \\"talk\\" in their heads while still in wolf form and they could hear each other. This fact has been alluded to in the past, but we don't need to actually hear it. It could only have been made worse if they had made the wolves' mouths move in time to the words as many kiddie animal movies do. No, this scene would have played out much better if they had all been in human form. And yes, the wolves seemed much smaller and less imposing this time.  Am I the only one who is left wondering why Edward said he could finally hear the baby's thoughts and then called it a HE when the baby was clearly a SHE? Was Edward simply lying to Bella to try to give her some comfort?    I watched this movie with a friend who hasn't seen a single one of these yet, and she completely hated it. She said the vampires looked ugly and she asked how they could be in the sunlight? My point exactly.    No, Breaking Dawn is not my favorite movie in this series. I think it could have been alot better with a different director.   Now to address the three major concerns that have some reviewers in such an uproar...which I find to be rather silly, myself.   1. Bella's bruises.  I don't view Bella's bruises from her honeymoon as spousal abuse. Anyone who has seen this from the beginning knows that Edward has always been afraid of hurting Bella because vampires are so strong, which is why they have never been together before. Once he saw the bruises he was horrified and did his best to avoid her. Bella pursued and seduced him because she wanted to feel human for as long as possible, not because she liked being hurt. She knew that feelings and sensations would change once she was no longer human, that's all, nothing abusive or perverse about it.   2. Bella's choice to keep the baby even though it could end her own life.   Bella knew that keeping their baby was her one and ONLY chance to have a child, once she became a vampire, no chance of babies. When she discovered she was pregnant against all odds...they didn't think it could happen, she chose to keep it because she hadn't realized before how much she wanted a baby.  Bella has also witnessed Rosalie's pain and anguish from never having a child of her own. So yes, Bella did risk her own life to save the baby, but she had always intended to be turned into a vampire, so she expected to be turned at the last minute of death, like the others in the Cullen family.   3. Jacob imprinting on the baby.  I was not offended by Jacob's imprinting on the newborn, I don't understand how anyone can view that as pedophilia. I see it as Jacob's ultimate sacrifice for Bella. He is now the protector and guardian of Renesmee. Jacob knows he can't have Bella and he refuses to love anyone else, so he chose to use his imprint to save the life of her newborn that she fought so desperately to bring into the world. That in no way means he intends to make the baby his bride. Jacob knew that if he imprinted on the baby, all the wolves would have to respect that (their ultimate law) and not kill the baby or harm her in the future. Edward was humbled and proud to announce the fact that Jacob imprinted on the baby because he knew what a great sacrifice it was for Jacob to go against his pack and save the child's life. Jacob will lead a solitary life without a mate because he chose to be the protector of Bella's baby. Jacob loves Bella, she loves Edward and the baby so Jacob saved the baby's life for Bella. That's all. Nothing pervy about it. Some people need to quit slanting things to their own sick, twisted way of thinking. And by the way...these are just fiction books and movies. They are not intended for real-life interpretations or representations...so why on Earth would anyone be so offended by a movie? No one is forcing you to watch, so don't.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Just started playing this, though stuck on Crossed Wires. Seems I can't score higher than 2,000 and you need 5,000 to &quot;win&quot;. I'm going to keep trying though. I'm having fun with it!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|the biggest advantage to this app for me is for the the TV.  Love accessing my TV through Windows Media Center.  Don't mind doing the dishes now I can watch the news or the game. I was concerned about connecting to my PC w/ 2 monitors on it but 'Slashtop' makes it work and work nice.  Good resolution and sound.  Wonderful user interface. htc droid incredible 2.3.7
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love brain games and this is one of the best I have found. Hard enough to tease but can be solved. The only thing I DON'T like is having to go to Face Book to get the hints when I need one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like the game. a lot!! it allows me to play different games and i never get bored. but i wish they didn't mane you start over with earning your points but overall good game
B004LWZVZC|5.0|We missed this show in the movies and we were thrilled when we got a DVD so we could see the movie about a subject we are interested in.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is essential to me.  I can quickly start a new note and then know I can access from any of my devices.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm a big gamer so this app is perfect for me! I especially love the various games offered, which keeps this app fresh and very entertaining. Since download, this has been my favorite gaming app :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very fun app. u should really try this it is fun and u have to work to unlock new games
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let's put it this way: I bought the first book and in LESS THAN 2 DAYS I'd finished the entire 3 book series. Couldn't put it down just doesn't seem to cover it. I was flat out addicted.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|One long, dark, ill Winter of Discontent, I spent months reading leather-bound, gilded old volumes of English lit classics, unearthed from a practically private, peculiar library. While snow fell in subzero cold, accumulating in indomitable drifts along the walls of my cottage in the crags, I huddled indoors, delving into Thackeray, George Elliot, Austin, Galsworthy's voluminous Forsythe Saga, lost Brontës, and a lone American: dark Edith Wharton's and her granite winter of Ethan Frome. Several, newish collections stood out from this dolorous lot. They turned out to be the jolly works of P.G. Wodehouse, his chuckle-out-loud romps. Wodehouse's corpulent country pigs were creatures to be admired, they remain vast and mired in my memory.<br /><br />But for the unnecessary focus on plumping in the last episode, and an unfortunate change in the casting of his Aunt Dahlia, this DVD set is pure delight, better than I remembered when it first played on PBS. Oh, that all men could have A Man to organize their messy lives with the suave effectiveness of Stephen Fry's Jeeves. If only I cold maintain such an unflusterable countenance. Were that all buffoons as gracefully daffy as Bertie Wooster, a hot-house flower with strange powers of durabilty. I celebrated the onslaught of the New Year by basking in this benign comedy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Best weather app for the fire. It tells all the information you need on the weather. Nice details and I like the 5 day forecast.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app tons of fun games to pass the time with. you'll be entertained for hours and hours and hours.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It definitely makes you think outside of the box. You'll want to keep playing over and over. If you are waiting some place just play this game
B003L77G8I|5.0|The DVD set was in excellent condition, never having been opened. Greatly enjoyed watching the 6th season at an affordable price. Thanks!
B0061S073A|3.0|My mother in-law bought both my kids (9 & 11) kindle Fires for Christmas.  They are old enough to play with apps, read books on it, watch videos & play music.  I limit their WiFi use through my own router, but I want to limit their ability to purchase anything.  I want them to have to come to me and ask me to type in a password for a purchase.  This app doesn't allow this.  They can't watch videos that have already been purchased.  To allow them to watch the video it also allows them to buy or rent other videos.  Same with music.  This is more of an Amazon problem.  They make it too easy to purchase things.  On my iPad I'm asked every time to enter my password even when it is free (I like that).
B003VS0CX8|2.0|This is one of my favorite movies, I love the plot, the music, and the beautiful places. However, if you want to watch in Spanish like do DON'T BUY IT. I had the regular DVD for years and the Spanish version in that one is great, but in this blue ray the Spanish Audio is just awful. The audio doesn't go with the lips of people talking, the songs are cut off in many parts, it is horrible. I do like however the commentaries and all the extra information about behind the scenes and the real Maria.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love being able to read the Bible from my kindle. The only thing I would like different would be to read it without being on the Internet.

B004M20YDU|4.0|I love Daft Punk in all their awesomeness. :) This cd, however, packs a bit of a punch and made some of their tracks much more energetic. Or, like in Derezzed, they slowed it down. I love all but a few tracks. I'll list my fav's.  1. Derezzed   2. Fall  3. The Grid  4. Adagio for Tron  9. Rinzler  14. Solar Sailer
B0063GORYU|5.0|i love this game. everyone should play it.  i harder it gets to better it is. try it you will love it too
B002ZG97E2|5.0|This is a great movie both for children and adults. There is humor on both levels.  It even has a moral with good triumphing over evil.
B00000DSEN|5.0|I purchased this CD for my son.  He loves it and had to have it for his collection. He played his last one until it played no more!
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I loved the light weight of this cover, and the grip/fastener strap, and the stand. I can see how some would say the stand is flimsy because it is indeed thin and flexible. However, I used it on the seat tray while flying and had no problems at all. The reason I can't recommend this is because after two days, the matte \\"rubberized\\" exterior, which is actually just a finish, started disintegrating and peeling in the corners and eventually along the edges of the cover, revealing a hard shiny plastic shell underneath. I don't know if the heat of the device (not that it gets hot) melted it, but that's what it looked like. I'm returning it and looking for a different brand.  UPDATE Jan. 10: I received a call from Amazon today that the cover's manufacturer had just recently corrected the problem of the distintegrating cover, so I could be assured that if I ordered another of the same model, the cover would be fine. I had already ordered a different brand (which I just received today)but if I hadn't I would have tried the Marware Lightweight Miroshell again, because I did like the design and weight. We'll see how this new, different cover goes. I appreciated the followup from Amazon.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Enjoyable solitaire game that helps pass short waits. Easy to use, don't need instructions to play. Definitely at least a 4 star rating.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|The CD arrived in perfect condition and in just a few days.  I was very happy with everything.  It was in plastic just like it would be it bought from a store.  It was a gift for Christmas and he was very happy with it too.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|good way to waste time.  lots of different games to pick from I like it will recommend to others soon
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It has sooooo many games! its kid friendly too! its the best app for anyone whether your young or old it is perfect.
B0000041LO|5.0|My husband and I love  all kinds of classical music.  When we heard one piece of music from this CD  on the radio we wrote the name of the piece down and ordered the CD.  We've played it over and over again and people have come to our home to hear it are amazed.  Hayden is an amazing composer and the Beaux Arts Trio have served him well.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app is perfect for me. recently I have been having odd feelings and growth spurts so I think I'm becoming a werewolf. now I know when the next full moon is coming so I can lock myself up before I eat anybody!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is filled with hours of fun some are very challenging but if you need entertainment or just something to add to your app collection this is for you get it now
1593974760|5.0|There's nothing that I can say that hasn't been said in the other hundreds of reviews. So I'll just make my review short and add to the 5 star rating.<br />This book was amazing! I loved loved loved Ender as an adult!  The narrators, oh my gosh, they were great!  Every single one of them, outstanding!  All of the audiobooks that I've listened to in the past with multiple narrators have been horrible and choppy.  Whoever picked these guys (and lady) did a really good job.<br />Loved the book, Loved the voices, Was able to finish it in a little over a day, Can't wait to start book 3!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really liked this game because it is really fun and it is not very hard. You should play it sometime.
1593974744|5.0|There's nothing that I can say that hasn't been said in the other 3,000 reviews.  So I'll just make my review short and add to the 5 star rating.<br />I really liked the book and the multiple narrators were amazing!  I was able to immediately start book 2, and was able to finish that book in a little over a day.  Ender's story is just letting you know how Ender got started......book 2, Ender as an adult, is amazing!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty cool except for the fact that I cant really when a game!  I'm horrible at it! but it is good quality and the games are fun.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|I saw this film at the theater and knew I wanted to watch it again and share it with friends. I felt the negative reviews by critics was unjust because it is a well-directed, well-acted, fun film for sci fi fans.  The story is a really unique (although totally unbelieveable) take on most \\"creature features\\". Fans of classic western films would find it to be really ridiculous.
B005FITIIC|5.0|A very timely movie.  Great acting and script.  It presents a lot of practical and ethical questions.  Very good dialogue, that keeps you listening intently.  No car chases, just good drama.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I am amazed at how great this toy is. this toy is beneficial to everyone since its not as easy as the age requirement may hint. Id recommend to anyone willing to challenge themselves.
7885726770|5.0|So much better than the remake.  A must see if you enjoy 19th century British war movies.  Also see Zulu.  You can skip Zulu Dawn.
6305428042|5.0|I purchased the movie for my mother-in-law. It is one of her favorite movies. I don't particularly care for the movie, but she wanted it for Christmas and loved it.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|This book is one of the best romantic fiction books I have read in a long time. It cover some of my favorite paranormal creatures i.e dragons, elves, and unicorns as well as creatures thar are not often wirtten about griffons & harpies. If you are a romantic paranormal fiction reader I would recommend this book even at the Kindle price. It is well worth it.
B005I6EU48|5.0|wonderful product did not have any problems with it. bought this for christmas for my daughter. it does look like a real book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great free app, lots of games and a wide variety of.different things to play. not.much to complain about since its free
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love this movie, so when I saw it for such a low price I had to get it! Definitely one of the better Harry Potter movies!
0062082353|5.0|If you're a liberal, don't pick up a book like this or you will end up writing a review like the idiots below....
B0054XOMX4|5.0|The Phantom Orion Beyblade was a real hit with our kids this year!  It has amazing longevity and withstands collisions with all the beyblades they battle.  We clocked the rotation time of this one at 4 continuous minutes!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|new to this game and so far I enjoy the challenges of opening each level by achieving the points needed per game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's a little frustrating to play because the movements require a more delicate touch than I can provide. also, it's hard to see where you need to go when you're finger is covering your object and you're hand is in the way of you the screen. why does it have to be 4,000 points? why can't you just accumulate points that go towards opening the other games?
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a fun game and I'd even fork over the money to avoid the intrusive video ads. So five stars for the game, but zero stars for customer choice.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|just wondering if the last update was coming for the last level. ot has been a while since there was an update.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I gave these to my son as a gift and he's been using them ever since. He really likes the headphones and loves how the sound seems to come from all directions! It's basically surround sound in a pair of headphones. They are a little high priced if you ask me, but if they continue to function without any problems I won't feel so bad about paying the price because my son really is enjoying playing video games, and watching movies using these headphones.
B002ID08QS|5.0|The ultimate music experience . Both CD and HDS Disc sound fabulous ..This would have to be the best George Benson High Def disc I've ever listen too. I have other G Benson DVD audio discs in Lossless P.PCM and they come a sad second to this DTS96/24 DVD-audio ...The select songs are outstanding and not on any other of George's albums which adds to this special Disc  .. This is a must have for any Audiophile and Jazz music lover.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game, but it does get a little bit repetitive after a few games as there are not a lot of different ways for the game to be completed.  Always play with 3+ people as playing with 2 people stifles trades and interaction between the players.  Overall, a very fun game so long as you have 3+ players.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not sure about this game yet. it is very interesting how you rack up credits to unlock k more games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is an excellent way to eat up time while having fun doing it. If you like solitary card games, spider is the game to play.
B0055V6EZE|4.0|Y'all don't be hatin' on Hugh's singing voice now! Maybe he's not the greatest vocalist in the world of Blues but some of the greatest Blues masters wouldn't be classified as great vocalists. You can hear the depth of his feelings in his voice and, to me, that is more important. Heck, Janis Joplin wouldn't have made the cut on America's Got Talent or American Idol, neither would Howlin' Wolf or Robert Johnson for that matter, but they all sang with pure soul and emotion. That is also true for Mr. Laurie. Plus, he is an impressive talent at playing the piano.  I received this CD as a Christmas gift and the first time I listened I didn't have great expectations, I was just hoping for something entertaining. I can't stop listening to it. He mixes Blues with Boogie Woogie in his own style.  I give it a high rating because, even though I don't watch his television show, I am just plain entertained by his music.  If you love Blues - old Delta Blues - I'd recommend that you would enjoy this CD.
0811879542|1.0|What a big disappointment.  Kids today are accustomed to something actually happening when they \\"press here,\\" and even our extremely bright 7-year-old didn't understand this book.  In fact, neither did some of the adults!  Once explained, it made sense to the seven-year-old, but a book shouldn't have to be explained.  As it's read, as it's acted upon, it should be understood.  Waste of time and money.  Am returning it ASAP!
B001CZVVVE|5.0|As my title notes, this is a keeper. One of the greatest opera concerts (not opera productions, but staged concerts) ever recorded. Anna Netrebko and Elina Garanca in the \\"Dome epais, le jasmin\\" duet from Delibes Lakme that will raise the hair on your neck and put a lump in your throat. Ramon Vargas and Ludovic Tezier sing the \\"au fond du temple saint\\" duet from Bizet's Pearl Fishers as well as it has ever been done (esp. the boyish-faced Vargas in the lead). And then there is Garanca primping and preening (vocally and theatrically) in the tavern scene from Rigoletto. And then there are the encores (five by my count), started off spicily enough by the hot-tamale Netrebko dancing her part (not pretending to dance, but dancing!) and throwing flowers to the men in the audience. But I better stop before I can't. Netrebko is a true prima donna assoluta, the greatest of the great for our era, but she is more than a disembodied voice. She has (vocal and operatic) star-power to die for, to put Angelina Jolie or Sharon Stone in the shade. This disk is a potentially life-changing event, as all of the greatest art always is. Enthusiastically recommended (especially in Blu-Ray, with its far superior picture and sound--something that is not usually recognized: you've never heard a DVD this beautiful!)
0525423281|5.0|Stephanie Perkins, please don't ever stop writing! Anna and the French Kiss was undoubtedly one of my favourite contemporary reads of the year, and let me just say that Lola and the Boy Next Door just proves once again how GENIUS this author can be.<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door is such an amazing book! It's beautiful and heartwarming and awkward and realistic and everything that a first love should be. Like with Anna and the French Kiss, the writing is detailed yet never boring, and it evokes so much emotion that there should be a warning for tears.<br /><br />Not only does this book have a flawless writing style, a breathtaking plot, and tons of swoon-worthy scenes, but the characters are perfectly imperfect. I absolutely adored Lola with all of her costume quirks, and I love love LOVED Cricket! (And if a girl who has a phobia of bugs can say that sentence, then you should know he must be a damn amazing guy.)<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss was pure magic, but Lola and the Boy Next Door was the breathtakingly genuine romance that every girl wants -- and just might get. I could recommend these books a million times and it still wouldn't be enough, so just know that  Lola and the Boy Next Door is a book you HAVE to read!<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: Buy it for sure! I'm usually more of a paranormal fan, but Perkins always writes books that are so realistic and easy to connect with that I just want to sit there and re-read them over and over again! :)
B001CZVVVO|5.0|My second favorite Blu-Ray opera disk (second only to the following year's \\"The Opera Gala\\" by the same company, Deutsche Grammophon). Anna Netrebko is amazing, as usual. (What else is new? What else would you expect?) And Placido Domingo is deep and deeply emotional. (His Sorozabal \\"la tabernera del puerto\\" is one for the ages.) This is a great concert filmed and edited intelligently and respectfully. And when Netrebko does her encore as Musetta (in Quando men vo), it has never been done like this before!! I don't want to be a plot-spoiler, so I won't say more than that she almost stops the orchestra and conductor (the very able Marco Armiliato) dead. They are so shocked they almost stop playing. What a moment. What a voice. What a star she is. Rolando Villazon is left just a little in the dust, behind the other two, panting to keep up, but he holds his own in most of his duets, and I'll cut him some slack since he is still young, and look who he's competing with! Highly, highly recommended (just a nose behind the Blu-Ray of the \\"Opera Gala\\" disk, if you can only afford one--but don't afford just one. Skip a meal; walk to work; don't pay the gas company; this is more important!).
0439023521|5.0|READ THIS BOOK.<br /><br />I'm SO tempted to leave my review as that single sentence, because that basically sums up the gist of my thoughts without getting into the gushing \\"this book is so amazing that I can't even find words for it\\" part! But I decided you guys deserve more than that. Just be forewarned: major gushing ahead.<br /><br />The Hunger Games has to be one of the best books in history! Definitely a favourite of mine! It's interesting and deep and romantic and original and realistic and I could use up all the positive adjectives in the world and it still wouldn't be enough!<br /><br />EVERYTHING about this book is amazing! Katniss is one of my favourite heroines; the side characters are all great; the romance is perfectly done; the action is heart-pounding; the premise is unforgettable; and the complex plot always keeps me on the edge of my seat -- sometimes in tears and most times without breathing!<br /><br />I seriously can't believe that I ever had a doubt before reading this book. The cover didn't really catch my eye and the synopsis sounded strange when I first saw it, but now I want to buy a copy for every person in the world just so they'll read it! It's THAT good.<br /><br />So the verdict? Read this book. Love this book. And get ready to have The Hunger Games always lingering in the back of your mind, because that's what it's like for me! :)<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: Has there ever been a more pointless question??? Buy it for sure! I've already read this book more times than I can keep track, and it still gets to me every single time!
B001IF9WJ6|1.0|I own many Blu-Ray and DVD opera recordings, and enjoy almost all of them (esp. the Blu-Ray ones), but cannot recommend this production. First, for anyone who is not already intimately familiar with opera and zazuelas (Spanish and Mexican light operas), you won't understand a word of the singing--in French, Italian, and Spanish. Decca cheaped it out and there ARE NO SUBTITLES for the singing. Un-friggin-believeable. How hard would that have been? How much would it have cost to pay a grad. student to type them into a subtitle file? (By the way: This is true of many, even most, of Decca's other opera releases on DVD and Blu-Ray, so beware of them too.) Second, the actual performances, in many cases (not all, but many) are a joke. Sting sings opera (or rather doesn't sing it at least not very well). Other pop stars make their celebrity bimbo appearances. Give me a break. Even Sting is clearly embarrassed and makes an apology that he is only doing it because he was asked and couldn't say no (given the \\"memorial service\\" nature of the event). Pavarotti himself became increasingly co-opted by the pop-star-celebrity ethos as he aged. (It was a way to save his voice and draw in listeners who wouldn't have listened anyway.) This whole production is as shabby as some of the big man's final concerts in that way; in fact, even worse, since Pavarotti was doing many of them for charity causes like WarChild, but this is meant to be taken seriously as serious music, which (with the fewest of exceptions--just a few memorable, though to repeat unsubtitled, performances) it is emphatically not.
0545123275|5.0|WOW. Wow, wow, wow. Why did I ever wait so long to pick up this book? I've heard so many mixed things about it that I was kind of scared at first -- but then I started Shiver just before I went to bed and I couldn't put it down!<br /><br />Not everyone can pull off writing a book from two alternating first person narratives, but Maggie Stiefvater definitely can! Her writing was so perfect and fitting for the story. I felt like I was right inside the book, surrounded by endless forests, lonely cold winters, and a town full of werewolves that were so different than what I was used to.<br /><br />For two characters who had such generic names, Sam and Grace were absolutely amazing! I ADORED Grace with her strength, determination, and heart of gold. And Sam, who had to live with the infection that made him turn into a wolf every winter, was so heartbreakingly real and good that I wanted to cry every time he was in pain. I swear almost did!<br /><br />But it wasn't just the awesome cast (with so many other great characters!) that made this book so good. It was the twisting plot, the oh-so-original werewolf lore, and the moments that stole my breath away! I could not put this one down for the life of me!<br /><br />Beautiful and lyrical and 100% enchanting, Shiver was a book that surprised me immensely -- in all the right ways! I would definitely recommend this book, and I'm SO excited to read the next book in the series! :)<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: Definitely a book you want on your shelf! It's such a powerful read!
B001U0D786|4.0|The movie is wonderful. Unfortunately, the Blu-Ray format does not have subtitles for viewers who may be hearing impaired or non-native English speakers who need the subtitles. It is very disappointing that the DVD production company did not  include the subtitles. If they ever update the Blu-Ray version, they ought to send new versions to those of us who purchased this one.
B005K2XP6Y|5.0|I recieved this product and love it. Its easy to get my kindle fire in and out of. Some of the other ones I bought are more difficult and will turn it on and the battery will run down. Not with this one. I also like the neutral colors and it seems to be very durable.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some good mini games although they do become repetitive at times. there are excessive pop up ads too and they do get annoying
B005M48WNQ|1.0|Foer's argument goes like this: \\"If pork were cleanly raised and humanely slaughtered, which it isn't, I would eat it, except that I'm Jewish, so I wouldn't eat it any event, and neither should you.\\" Brilliant? Morally ferocious? I'm agnostic on vegetarianism but quite convinced that the author is a chameleonic opportunist.
B0063GORYU|3.0|The game should not count your stats as a loss if you deal a new deck before you make a move.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its okay. I mean like its fun for when you want to milk some time. I like it I guess.
B0038M2AZA|3.0|I just loved this movie, and knowing it was based on a true story made it even more compelling.  My extended family all watched it and made many positive comments to me about it.  Everyone thought it was wonderful.  Thanks JR
0446581348|5.0|Love the book.. great condition. very specific and easy for those who dont know so much about makeup and skin health. also great for those who know a lot but could use a few reminding or new tips. would definitely purchase another one for a friend.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a really really really really. really really really good good good good good good good good good game
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like this version of solitaire just fine. if I'd wanted ad free ware, I'd have paid for another version.  it plays smoothly without too many interruptions.
B005XN0SGU|2.0|This app has the potential to be good, but unfortunately is way to buggy to enjoy.  It not only skips between pages but sometimes between CBR files and it happens so often as to completely ruin the good features this app brings to the table.
1439102813|5.0|We bought this for our staff to help understand what famlies go thru. Most could not put the book down. The staff enjoyed the book,it opened up a few eyes.
B001HN6918|5.0|Kung Fu Panda 2 is a continuation of the first movie and Po is part of the Dragon Warrior team. Po's skills are improving but he is still not the master that Tigress is for example.  His master tells him that he has to learn to focus and learn inner peace.  Po's tactic is to charge into the fight instead of developing a strategy and analyzing the enemy.<br /><br />An evil warrior enemy is threatening to take over all of China and when his evil warriors start to steal materials to make a secret weapon the Dragon Warrior team jumps in to stop them.  When Po sees the warriors he starts having flashbacks about his origins and where he came from.  This causes a lack of self-confidence and this is exactly what Po does not need when confronting a powerful enemy.<br /><br />This is a good storyline with Good facing Evil and how Po must be brave and find his inner self to become the warrior he needs to be to defeat his enemy.  Po's transition from a Dragon Warrior to a powerful Kung Fu master is fun and interesting. The graphics in this movie are wonderful and make the movie.  It is an exciting action movie with comedy and fun built in!
0553582038|1.0|Well that was a huge waste of my time. The other books were very interesting and the story moved along and was engaging to read. This book was boring, long winded chapters that any decent editor would have cut and burned. Nothing about our favorite characters and too much about minor characters of no interest to the story. Aryra and Bram are wasted chatacters with potential lost. Sansa becomes insipid and shallow.
B000000Y26|4.0|As far as the content goes this is a must have for fans of Wes Montgomery or guitar jazz, or jazz in general. The guitar playing is top notch, piano, drums and bass excel also. This part I give a 5.  For the vinyl quality that is another story. The copy I received is warped and so needs a clamp to play properly. There are also a few pops here and there, not excessive though. This part I give a 3.  When I REALLY want an album I usually get 180g virgin vinyl but they cost more. I paid $13.98 for this, it is worth that but no more. Overall I give this purchase a 4.

1439153663|5.0|Kathleen Grissom's novel, \\"The Kitchen House,\\" is a page-turner. It keeps the reader enthralled from page one until the end. It is interesting, well-written, and definitely a book worth reading. It brings alive a historical period that has not been extensively covered. I highly recommend this book. Grissom's novel brings the characters to life and puts the reader in the time and place of the novel. I find this book to be very memoriable and definitely a book that everyone should read.
B006O5YHUY|5.0|to me this is more of a chick flick than a guy film even though there's a lot of sports action in the movie - it's just a very strongly emotional film - and it was very emotional for me as well - some things weren't very realistic - but that's part of the emotional pull of the movie -  For example there's no way that this Kuba character is a middleweight - he looked like a light heavyweight to me - and Tess - she seemed much more patient than most women - and I'm like how did this guy get a girl this hot -  I was totally blown away at how incredibly disrespectful both men were of their father - it was obvious that this man was not perfect but the disrespect that they showed him was just horrible in my mind - but the film was one of the best sports films I've ever seen.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I started using ColorNotes several months ago on my mobile, and it was among the first apps I looked for when I got a Kindle Fire.  It's a very easy app to set up, you decide whether you want to create essentially a text document or a checklist, then type in what you want to save, just like other note-taking apps. Copying/pasting from other docs works well, too, though you can't turn a text doc into a checklist, or at least I haven't figured that one out yet.  (If I do, I'll add that to this review.)  One can even color-code their notes, as well as name those categories (such as naming the green notes &quot;household&quot;), and organize notes by those categories or in simple alpha order.  Some reviewers mentioned the inability to save notes.  Really?  ColorNote offers an online backup to their cloud, which you can set up to sync your notes manually or every time you open the app.  Don't trust their cloud?  Then you can use your backup app (you do have a backup app, right?) to backup your notes to your device or SD card or to the backup app's server.  Don't use a backup app?  Then save individual notes to your SD card.  Or after saving to SD, you can plug your device into your computer and copy the notes over for even more backing up.  And if none of those options sound appealing, use their Send feature to copy to the clipboard and paste into another doc, send as an attachment, email it to yourself or someone else, send via Bluetooth, or post it to Facebook.  There's also a feature called Archive that I suspect backs up the notes in a different manner, but I have not used it so can't say for certain if that is yet another way to save your notes.  But including Archive, that's THIRTEEN ways and places you can backup all that data you entered.  And if those features aren't enough for you, you can also password-protect any or all of your notes.  Use the built-in calendar to send yourself a reminder to do whatever you typed into a certain note.  Run a search of all yournotes for a word or phrase.  Use their online-sync feature to always have your most up-to-date notes sync between the devices you use the app on -- for me that syncs my notes on my mobile and my Fire so there's no need to figure out which is the &quot;correct&quot; version.  Each time I've thought of something I'd like to organize and look around for apps to do it, most if which cost a few bucks, I realize that my trusty ColorNotes will do the same thing.  I'd happily pay money for all this but the developer is generous enough to provide all of this FOR FREE.  Seriously.  You might find all these features in some other app, but you're already looking into this one so just go ahead and press that download button, I'm sure you'll be pleased.
B004K4IZ3G|2.0|A massive fan of Daft Punk (and, to a lesser extent, a devotee of Jeff Bridges) I knew that seeing Tron: Legacy was non-negotiable. In hindsight, however, the money for my $9 ticket would have been much better spent on purchasing the amazing soundtrack and skipping the movie altogether. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the visual aspect of the film -- the graphics were, altogether, quite stunning. So where did the film go wrong?  For starters, the characters were underdeveloped, unexciting, over-played tropes. Although the film seemed to start promisingly with Sam (Garrett Hedlund) presenting a kind of maverick computer genius, he very quickly devolves into your run-of-the-mill, orphan-child-comes-into-his-own hero. The film's principal female character, Quorra (Olivia Wilde), was--if anything--even worse. As a woman I tend to tire of overly-sexualized female  leads, but I honestly could've done with a powerful, female temptress in this film. Especially as nobody else in the film seemed to eminate any sort of mysterious attraction, it would've been nice to see any character exert some sort of draw or power over the others -- no such luck. Instead of a strong female lead, Wilde's character is portrayed as a naive, eager-to-please pushover whose strange apprentice-type relationship with Flynn (my beloved Jeff Bridges) borders on creepy. If you're going to dress her in a full-bodied spandex catsuit, at least paint her as something other than a dewy-eyed child. As for Jeff Bridges, suffice it to say that even he could not save this movie; shades of \\"The Dude\\" do not really mix well with the paradoxically omnipotent and helpless character of Flynn.  Whether a result of weak character roles or the cause of them, the miserable excuse for a plot in the movie really drives the nails into the coffin. Once inside \\"the Grid,\\" any semblance of conflict or tension  melts away with a boring (and predictable) story line. I frequently found myself wondering at points in the movie, \\"is this actually happening?\\" -- and not in a good way. I do not want to spoil the film for those of you still compelled to watch it, but the film's magic plot formula can generally be boiled down into \\"Sam gets into trouble by trying to escape + Sam gets rescued + Sam makes off in stolen or illegal vehicle = Sam attempts to escape again and gets into more trouble, at which point the cycle starts over again.\\" I can count three distinct iterations of that formula. Needless to say, the whole thing is boring, predictable, and a very poor excuse for a plot.  It really is a shame this took years of time and creativity from Daft Punk...
B000F3T3CS|5.0|Italian composer Donizetti composed at least fifty operas in his lifetime.  Some are superbly written, others are quite adequate, and others are just plain bland. Several are highly successful, and are staples in various opera houses all around the world. L'Elisir D'Amore is one of his most successful comic operas, and judging only by its scenario, it's a small wonder why it's so popular even today. It's a simple story, but the music is satisfyingly filled to the brim with legitimate humor and Bel Canto delights. Plus, the four main characters are likable, even the antagonist (it is a comedy after all).<br /><br />Set in an 18th Century Italian village (where else?), Nemorino, the penniless village idiot, is in love with a beautiful woman named Adina. Since she is far richer than he is, he knows that there's a very slim chance that she will admire him. Despite the social status, he will do all he can to please her. When an eccentric traveling salesman named Dulcamara arrives in the village, Nemorino asks if he possesses a love potion that will make Adina fall in love with him. Dulcamara shows him the potion and sells it to him. Unfortunately, the so-called love potion is only wine and Nemorino remains ignorant of this fact. Complications occur with army sergeant Belcore, who is also in love with Adina. And then...well, it's best to watch the rest of the opera to see what happens.<br /><br />This Viennese production is thankfully traditional. If it was given a modern/post-modern approach, it would've made much less sense. Imagine if it took place in a present-day New York alley (or worse, a Cubist oil refinery) instead of an Italian village. Anyway, the 18th Century costumes and sets look authentic. The soloists appear to be the true stars of this production. Their dictions, phrasings, and of course, acting abilities are highly marvelous. You can easily tell that they had such a fun time with their respective roles. Netrebko as Adina is wonderful: she is easily a winner with her expressive singing. Villaz&oacute;n is the highlight of this production as he is the ultimate Nemorino. He's got the village idiot personality down to a T. His excitement and comic timing brings new energy to this opera. I've seen the Metropolitan Opera's staging of D'Amore from the early 80's, and while the late Pavarotti is no doubt a fantastic tenor, he seems to lack the energetic behavior that is required for such a character. Villaz&oacute;n has got it, and he gives such an amazing performance. D'Arcangelo plays the quirky salesman Dulcamara, and although he looks a bit too young for the role, he sings with comic passion. He clearly enjoys playing the character with his lively expressions. Leo Nucci has sung as Belcore for such a long time, and his expertise brings top quality for the antagonist. He's still got it after all these years. Finally, maestro Eschw&eacute; conducts the opera with tight flexible tempi. He never controls the music with a snail's pace, nor does he rush it like a horse on caffeine. The quick tempos that are chosen are necessary for such a lighthearted opera. The orchestra and choir of the Weiner Staatsoper (aka, Vienna State Opera) are in top form from beginning to end.<br /><br />This is the production of D'Amore that I would highly recommend. There are a few arias that have been cut, but overall, it's highly amusing, and just completely enjoyable to watch and listen. Both acts are full of surprises: there's even one instance in which D'Arcangelo actually breaks the fourth wall near the end of the second act. This is what makes this production so fun and satisfying. Some of the humor may be outdated, but it's simple old-fashioned enjoyment and it still holds up compared to the lame toilet humor that we normally see on television. I had such a wonderful time watching this production, and I think it's time that I buy a CD recording of the entire opera. I'll find out which one I should purchase sooner or later.<br /><br />Official Grade: 10 out of 10

B00422LESO|3.0|This is such a silly book, with so many plot holes. Like why doesn't Jane just go home if she's so fed up at Austenland? Why would someome from Sheffield support Manchester United? Only one Henry Jenkins in Brighton (really?). I would say that if Bridget Jones Diary is a re-working of Pride and Prejudice, then Austenland is a re-working of Bridget Jones Diary. But it's harder to get under Jane's skin than Bridget. She comes across as spoilt and supremely annoying, but I confess I was very pleased with the outcome. I may even go and see the film adaptation. It's a good romp, but it's never going to win any prizes for being challenging or thought provoking.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|I used this product to cut several different size wine bottles. It is not easy to readjust for each size bottle, you are limited to how far you can cut down on a bottle, and its easy for the cutter to slip and make an uneven cut unless you take great care during the scoring of the glass. Once I discovered the limitations mentioned, I built my own cutter for $8.00 that was faster, required no resets,and made far more clean cuts. Using this product, I was able to get six useable bottles out of ten after fourty-five minutes. With the one I built, I got seventeen useable bottles out of twenty in the same amount of time. Will probably give this cutter away to someone I don't like.

0307592731|5.0|Cheryl Strayed is a heck of a good writer.  In this book about her physical journey up part of the Pacific Crest Trail and the journey her soul takes to accept the hand life has dealt her, the author seamlessly weaves two tales into a very readable work.<br /><br />Strayed had a challenging family life that was dominated by her love for her mother, a love richly reciprocated.  When cancer took her mom in her early forties, the twenty-two year old Strayed's world became unmoored.  Her step-father and siblings drifted apart.  She embarked on reckless behavior that cost her a marriage to a man she apparently was in love with.  Numerous brief liaisons, drug use and constant grief started her on a spiral that foreshadowed a tragic ending.  She was constantly at war with the strength her mother's support and love gave her and her anger and remorse at her mom's early departure.<br /><br />Having grown up in rural Minnesota, her salve was unexpected but not implausible.  A chance glance at a book on the Pacific Crest Trail led her to vow to hike this more rugged and less traveled cousin to the Appalachian Trail.<br /><br />Strayed's trail decision was impulsive and ill-planned.  Particularly for one deciding to journey as a solo hiker.  Predictably she faced early walls from a vastly over stuffed back pack, lack of proper fitting footwear and wild optimism regarding the miles a novice backpacker could travel over alternately hot and dry and then cold and snowy rugged terrain.<br /><br />Her thoughts on her life, her loves and her mother are a constant companion on the trial.  Flashbacks are interspersed with hard lessons learned about back country hiking.  So this is two books in one - a young and fit woman molding her body with hard learned experience to the arduous task of willing herself hundreds of miles through western wilderness and a wounded daughter dealing with a mother who had been omnipresent and whose absence was not accepted.<br /><br />I had initially wondered if this book could balance both strings of the story, but Strayed does this well.  She lets her past and actions that produced her predicament all hang out.  If she concealed any tidbits of past behavior from the reader it must have been about capital crimes for her bluntness and brut honesty about her actions involve intimacies that most people would be hard pressed to talk about let alone write for the world to view.  While it does produce a feeling of voyeurism in the reader, it is a big part of her story and not gratuitous.  She does this in a fashion that never becomes maudlin nor assumes the mantle of \\"woe is me.\\"  Her trail story is similarly excellent and adventure readers like me will very much enjoy learning about what hiking through some of the country's most challenging terrain is like.<br /><br />This book will undoubtedly be compared to Bill Bryson's \\"A Walk in the Woods,\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed.  They are two very different books.  Bryson uses his trip to educate in his tangential style about the history and tidbits of the Appalachian Trail and is wickedly funny regarding people and predicaments he encounters.  Strayed, though she can describe humorous people and situations, is not witty nor does she try to be.  Her story is more of a boots-on-the-ground and window-into-her-soul account.  At this she is successful and has produced a compelling book I read over the course of a couple of days.if this book could balance both strings of the story, but Strayed does this well.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book was a very interesting read. I thought Walter Isaacson did a great job with the information he researched and presented to the reader. In some ways, I had hoped for a bit more personal information about Steve Jobs - more along the lines of Steve's views, personal impressions, and feelings about the different things in his life, his choices, decisions, experiences, and so on. But in other-ways, the book provided so much information about the life of Steve Jobs that I felt the reader had a better understanding of Steve Jobs as a person than he probably had of himself in many degrees. Steve is an amazing person which gave a lot to the world, on the backs of others who were the true creators and artists of life.  In short Steve seemed to suffer from a narcissistic personality disorder. He was a perfectionist - so much so that it controlled his life (matter of mind not mind of matter) and he believed that he was an artist of sorts and with those problems he trotted on the average person. You were either great in his eyes, or you were yesterday's trash, nothing in between, no average, not even normal. In my opinion it's easy to demand 10 artists to paint a picture with out giving any direction or input to the artists and in the end proclaim only one of them to be a masterpiece. And to add insult to injury complain about things like the picture frame, or the lighting used to light the picture and than present the work of art as being co-authored from your self and the artist who actually did all the work themselves. I suspect if Steve had not become wealthy at a young age, life would of whipped him in shape and he would of learned to deal with his behavior problems as such a person rarely makes it in society since things like holding onto a job tends to be more important to most people than their pride and ego. But if that were the case, than there wouldn't be the Apple, as we know it today.  A great book for anyone who has a geeky interest in the personal computer boom from the 80's, Apple computers, and even a curiosity  of the legendary Steve Jobs.  In 25 to 50 years from now people will read about Steve Jobs from history and for those of us who will still be alive can sit back and say.. yes, I remember when all of these things happened and how the world seemed excited about the things Steve Jobs did.

1400052181|4.0|It's pretty obvious a lot has changed in the last sixty years.  This book will remind you just how far we've come as a society by recounting the stories involved in bio-medical research, the use of human cell/tissue cultures in that research, doctor/patient relationships, and the treatment of blacks during that period of history.  The author took on a daunting task: to uncover the identity of the donor who through the use of her cells, allowed medical research to make so many wonderful discoveries.  It was not an easy path for an author to pursue.  Many of us would have abandoned the project as years dragged on, people involved were angry and unpleasant (often for good reason, sometimes out of astounding ignorance), and there seemed to be no end--let alone payoff-- in sight.<br />But the author persisted for ten years. This book reveals how a poor and ignorant black woman was treated by the medical profession in the early 1950s.  But, in telling the whole story we learn also of the sad consequences of generations of poor black people growing up and reproducing (often due to sexual abuse or rape within the family).  It is not a pretty picture and the reader gets a close-up look at the aftermath, the descendants of Henrietta Lacks (the person who unwittingly helped science help all of us).  It made me decide that the root of all evil is really ignorance.<br />Part of the book is the search for the story by the author.  So it has some qualities of a detective story.  Part of the book is the multi-generational tale of a multi-racial family in Maryland/Virginia from slave days to the present. The author does a great job of presenting various characters in the story so we care about them, and the search for the story about Henrietta, as though we were reading a novel.  And part of the book makes the reader think about ethical issues involved in bio-medical research.  So, it's a nonfiction book with overlapping genres.  Most people love it.  There are nearly a thousand reviews (overwhelmingly five stars!) on Amazon.  But, I also know that some readers hate a book with overlapping genres, so be forewarned.<br />My only criticism is there were too many names dropped in the extensive notes and acknowledgements.  Did the author need to enlist every contributor and include every note taken?  But, it easy enough to skip over if it's not compelling to you.erwhelmingly five stars!) on Amazon.

B001K3KK0Q|2.0|I wish that I could say this movie is a worthy attempt at adapting a great American novel to screen. I wish I could say this, but I can't say this any more than Daisy could say she never loved Tom. If there is one statement that can honestly be made, it is that _The Great Gatsby_ could have been great. In the hands of a different director, this could have been worthwhile.<br /><br />The director must undoubtedly take the brunt of the blame for this flop, but even the actors must take some responsibility for their involvement in this flat and lifeless bore of a film.  Mia Farrow proves that \\"shallow character\\" and \\"shallow actor\\" are not synonymous; again, maybe it is the director's fault, but even though we can't fully sympathize with Daisy in the novel, I doubt Fitzgerald intended her to be as completely abrasive and unlikeable as she is portrayed in this adaptation. Sam Waterston's performance as Nick is passable, but whenever he appears on the screen, he seems less like Nick and more like a talented actor vexed to be trapped in this disaster of a film; furthermore, he already looks like a middle-aged man rather than a young man seeking his fortune. Even Robert Redford vogues for the camera and hopes his persona will eclipse his lack of direction and motivation. It doesn't; he obviously just doesn't care. Especially horrible is Bruce Dern in his role as Tom Buchanan. He reads his lines hollowly and dispassionately and seems totally oblivious to the fact that he has successfully converted memorable prose into passionless drivel.<br /><br />Besides the horrible direction and painful acting, the movie itself is forty minutes longer than it need be. The delivery of the dialogue feels like one awkward pause. The director inserts several scenes that work well in the novel but are superfluous in the film. Had they been well-executed, these scenes would still have felt forced, but as it is, these scenes give the feel of watching a high-school production of a novel the students fail to appreciate, much less understand. The best example of this is the weirdly interpreted scene showing a minor character, Michaelis, after the death of Myrtle pleading with Wilson to tell him the name of a church. In other places, characters and scenes that would have played out well onscreen, such as the drunken Owl Eyes sobering up in Gatsby's library, are sadly absent. How could any self-respecting director fail to see the comedic potential and significance of such a scene while wasting our time with the ten-minute marathon in Wilson's garage, or the ridiculous dance sequence between Gatsby and Daisy?<br /><br />Well, at least the soundtrack redeems this film, right? After all, Nelson Riddle's score won the Academy Award for Best Music. Well, what I hear is no award-winning score, but generic rubbish. In fact, it is partly the soundtrack that makes this such a chore to watch. With the right music, even a really bad movie can still be entertaining, or at least watchable. The same motif (\\"What'll I Do?\\") is crucified within the 144 minutes this film will steal from your life. After seeing this film, every time you hear \\"What'll I Do?\\", you will throw up a little in your mouth.<br /><br />The positives? The costumes look nice and the sets are extremely attractive, which only drives home the sad point that, alas, in the hands of another director and a better cast, this movie could have been good. Even scriptwriter Francis Ford Coppola practically disowned this mess.

1402760663|5.0|This book can only be described as an absolute collectors item. Its lay-out is superb, as are the many photos and drawings.<br /><br />I found only one draw-back: the only Roman Nose shown in this Illustrated Edition, is a Lakota (possibly Brule) by the same name.<br /><br />The great Southern Cheyenne warrior and leader Roman Nose (Woquini) can be found in the original edition between pages 252 and 253. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) describes the man in his book \\"Indian Heroes and Great Chieftains\\" in such a way, that only the photo in the original edition can do the man justice. This is the Roman Nose, who was killed by Forsythe's scouts at the Beecher Island fight (the fight where Roman Nose died).<br /><br />I will further protect my book with a strong, clear plastic cover to keep it in pristine condition.<br /><br />Can only highly recommend this book to anyone, who is even slightly interested in the facts regarding the real history of the 19th Century Indian struggle for survival!

B00136LSBK|5.0|Muddy was on top of his game when he recorded this.  The album title came from how Muddy felt while recording this.  I can see why.  Some of the best blues out there is on this release.  If you don't have this, you should get it.  No good blues collection should be without this recording.

Thought I'd give this a shot, and it's been in the top of my 2012 rotation since.  A surprise like this is welcome!
0060873027|2.0|Being a great fan of Crichton, I had high expectations for this book. Unfortunately I was disappointed. If this was a work in progress by Crichton before he died then I can only conclude that he had only gotten to a general plot outline. The writing is not Crichtons. From beginning to end the style is entirely Preston. Crichton was a meticulous, careful and accurate writer with heavy real science. Preston is not. Of course this only my opinion but I would advise anyone who enjoys Crichton to get this book from the library and not buy it, if you want to read it at all, that is.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I had fun reading this book and was up into the wee hours of the morning finishing all three books at once. However, throughout it all I couldn't help but feel that the the characters were a bit too flat and sometimes felt contrived. I didn't completely believe their rage or their passion or their love. The main character is the typical strong woman heroine who is headstrong, impulsive, self-sacrificial, and conflicted in an oh-so-typical love triangle (think twilight). And that's all she is. Regardless, the book's premise is an interesting concept and I recommend it for a fast-paced and entertaining read.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|A documentary full of soul that puts the band in a light never seen before. This is a great film either your are a Foo Fighters fan or not. Although, if you're not, I doubt that you'll remain a \\"non-fan\\" after seeing this.

B0059XTTW8|4.0|Gary Oldman heads an All-Star cast in this interesting spy thriller based on a novel of the same name.  The time is the mid to late 1960's at the height of the Cold War.  The Brits and the Soviets had agents infiltrating each other's country and even their intelligence agency.  George Smiley (Oldman) and his boss known only as Control (John Hurt) are dismissed from MI-6 for spending too much time looking for a spy within their ranks.  After Control dies mysteriously in bed, Smiley is returned to service by the Home Secretary to pursue the potential of a double agent within their ranks.<br /><br />Control had assigned possible targets as chess pieces and gave them the individual code names of the title.  There is very little in the way of action in the film although there are a few brutal torture scenes and violent deaths.  The action is all in the byplay between the characters.  The potential double agent include high ranking officials within MI-6 including Bland (Ciaran Hinds), Haydon (Colin Firth), Alleline (Toby Jones) and Smiley himself.  Smiley enlists the help of a  couple trusted compatriots including Peter (Benedict Cumberbatch) and a wild card agent played by Tom Hardy.<br /><br />Clues as to who the agent might be are few and far between and it is sometimes difficult to keep up with what is going on due to the nomenclature and British accents, but it's fun to try.  There are numerous scenes of silence as Smiley reflects on past events in an effort to tie everything together.  I couldn't help but think of Oldman's performance as Sid Vicious in \\"Sid and Nancy\\" (1986) where he played the obnoxious, profane drugged out rock star.  A completely different character from this thoughtful, political, cautious and quiet secret agent bureaucrat.  In the end, this is his movie.  His performance is terrific.<br /><br />Blu ray update:  This 1080P disc is presented in a 2.35:1 aspect ratio nearly the same as the theatrical production.  For those grainophiles, the transfer might be bothersome, but for me it is exactly as I remember in the theater.  This includes the bleak, brownish and smokey coloring.  Just like the filmmakers intended.  The DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is exemplary.  The hushed, soft voices are clear and concise.  Really well done.er might be bothersome, but for me it is exactly as I remember in the theater.  This includes the bleak, brownish and smokey coloring.  Just like the filmmakers intended.

1468161660|5.0|First of all let me start by saying I bought the book, actually read the book and I have not been ask by Colleen Hoover to post a review. This is me giving my honest opinion.   Now with that out of the way on with the important stuff. I guess you could say I bought this book by 'word of mouth' so to speak. I am more into paranormal reading than anything, but after hearing a little about this book I was soon hitting the buy button and I'm glad I did.  This story and characters really drew me in. I finished the book in one day and have even thought of the characters since shutting off my Kindle. This is rare for me. I have even found myself talking to others about it.   I don't want to give anything away so I will just end saying this. If you want a page turner with characters you start caring about then buy this book. As I said, this is a genre that I don't usually read, but I will definitely be looking for her next book and hitting that buy button. Who needs a clean house anyway....hummm.

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|I presume the pacing of this film is supposed to reflect the afterlife. I hope not, I dont want to spend eternity with that 'Sunday-afternoon-after-a-weekend-doing-nothing' feeling. Half the problem is that it cant seem to decide whether to be an out and out, if understated, supernatural thriller, or an exploration of the known science of near death experiences. If the latter, Matt Damon's character is as jarring as he is irritating. He is the 'one in 10 billion' or whatever it might be, who has a genuine window into the beyond, except that he won't use the ability, 'I dont want it, it's ruined my life, boo-hoo, poor me' etc. If anyone with his ability does exist, he would single handedly revolutionise our science, stun skeptics at CSICOP and win James Randi's $1,000,000 challenge for scientific proof of the paranormal. Therefore we can probably take it that this aspect is not based on fact.   The French newsreader character was far more interesting, and should really have had the film to herself. She was on a journey of discovery that does seem rooted in genuine experience, and could have been used to open up discussion of the scientific study of near death experiences. The brief scene in the German hospice was a particular lost opportunity. The Dr there was worthy of a wider role herself.   All in all, and interesting and worthy exploration of a field that must fascinate all of us. I'm not entirely sure whether it is appropriate to weave real world disasters that touched the lives of hundreds of thousands into a fictional thesis on the 'Hereafter', but it's great that Clint chose to explore this theme. I'd have done it differently, but I doubt any major studio would give me the time and money... (if I'm wrong, let me know)

0439813786|5.0|There is a certain way I judge a great movie.<br /><br />I stay through the credits, as if trying to soak up as much of the film as possible before it is gone. Both the first and second Spider Man films kept me glued to my seat long after the last scene ended, even though my wife was tugging at my arm and the theater usher was already sweeping the floor. No Country for Old Men, the entire Lord of the Rings series, Pan's Labyrinth, the list goes on and on.<br /><br />I have never been able to apply that same type of judgement to a book. Until yesterday.<br /><br />I finished the last few pages of The Invention of Hugo Cabret, a hulking 500+ page masterpiece of words and art that tell a story so masterfully magical that my own feeble and clumsy words cannot explain it. It is everything I love about children's literature. A young protagonist with an amazing natural talent, a peculiar girl with an adventurous spirit, twists, turns, charm, heart, and a mystery that takes the reader on a journey through the magic of books and film and how lives are changed through both. It is, without doubt, one of the most beautiful books I have ever read.<br /><br />I don't want to go too much into the plot because I feel it would lessen some of the magic. I will tell you that it follows a young boy named Hugo, recently orphaned, who hides in the walls of a train station in Paris and keeps the clocks working. Before his tragic death in a museum fire, Hugo's father was trying to fix an automaton, a small mechanical man with a mysterious past. Hugo is obsessed with finishing his father's work and often steals parts from the toy shop located in the train station. When he is finally caught by the toy maker, however, things begin to unravel for Hugo as he is plunged into a secret kept hidden for years that connects Hugo, his father, and the toy maker in ways he never would have imagined.<br /><br />This book combines (and glorifies) two of my great loves: books and movies. There are intentional shout-outs to classic directors/actors like Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin. In addition to his own drawings, Selznick also includes stills from classic films that compliment the story and add to its realism and magic. A book store in the train station resembles The Cemetery of Forgotten Books from [[ASIN:0143034901 The Shadow of the Wind]]. It is a book lover's paradise, with wall-to-wall bookshelves and a floor littered with stacks of books. I imagined I could find any book in a heaven such as this.<br /><br />Just trust me when I say you should read this book. The 500+ pages is misleading, as is calling it a \\"children's book.\\" I finished it in just a few days. Even if you have seen the movie (I have), the book its own magical journey and a very different experience than the film. It also has a better ending.<br /><br />Back to my point. I literally read every word of the book, right down to the notes on the final page about what type of font was used. I was so enchanted by the book that I wanted to absorb every bit of its magical energy into my heart and mind before putting it down and moving on to something else. And even now, I am resisting the urge to pick it up and read it again. It will be tough to send it back to the library, but I am excited about passing it on for someone else to enjoy its charm. With a cover price of $24.99, it may be a while before the book graces my bookshelf, but in time...<br /><br />If you haven't already, read the book. Check it out from the library or pick it up at your nearest book store (preferably and independent one (like my favorites, Taylor Books and Empire Books).<br /><br />Until later. \\"Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do...Maybe it's the same with people,\\" Hugo continued. \\"If you lose your purpose...it's like your broken.\\"<br />¯ Brian Selznick, The Invention of Hugo Cabretster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and Charlie Chaplin.

I don't want to give anything away because it's all so interesting as to how he created it. It's really rather simple! Buy a pair of shoes or now, sunglasses and his company returns the favor by giving a pair of shoes or helping vision costs for people who need them!<br /><br />Being an elementary Spanish teacher, I love traveling and although, I've never been to Argentina, I've traveled to my fair share of impoverished countries just crying for someone to care.

Read this book - it may help you see things differently and inspire you to start something that matters!
B002IVLH60|5.0|Of course any music review is tainted by the subjectivity of the reviewer and there are no absolute good/bad albums/artists... But I have to say that when Pearl Jam came back from their lower end of Binural and Riot Act, they came back to what made them noticeable over the other alternative out there and what set them apart from the so called grunge in the 90's. Having been one of those snooty fans who became fickle with Pearl Jam after No Code and Yield (now kicking myself for it) I had to re listen to their last four albums to appreciate their latter works. It took me a year or two for Pearl Jam to grow on me, but Backspacer was awesome right from the start. Great dynamic of songs and songs that rock. They have found a sound that is somehow uplifting and emotional, still introspective but not as dark as their earlier stuff. Much of their rocking stuff has almost a late 70's hard rock feel to it. Old school fans like us need to stop expecting another Vs. and appreciate Pearl Jam's evolution.

074322454X|4.0|For someone who is new to reading military history and WWII this is an entertaining read. As the title implies, the author focuses around the men of Easy Company of the 101st Airborne and describes the war from their perspective. The book is full of grimy details that serve to anchor the horrific reality of war into the minds of civilians far removed from conflict.<br /><br />Ambrose is largely unconcerned with many of the questions historians ask. Instead, he asks the questions of a biographer. Causes for conflict, military strategy, and tactical details were mostly absent from this short book. Considering the author's apparent purpose for this brief book, this is an easily excusable absence but will likely leave more historically-minded readers eager for a less dramatic treatment of the surrounding events.<br /><br />I can see why this book easily became such popular film series, as Ambrose's style of writing felt like the Hollywood version of a good book, except Ambrose did the screenwriting in the actual book. I don't count this to be a fault, simply unique. I guess I'd describe it as a movie-like book. Though we constantly hear of books turning into movies, we rarely hear of movies turning to books. It was as if Ambrose turned the real-life cinema of WWII into a book.<br /><br />I especially appreciated Ambrose's willingness to expose many of these men's faults alongside of their heroics. His descriptions of these men and the rest of those who were a part of the WWII effort seemed to me to be particularly balanced and fair. He praised heroism, but didn't assume a man to be a hero simply because he was in uniform, or saw combat. Ambrose did not fail to appropriate honor to these men but seemed to refrain from overstatements as he reserved his highest compliments for Major Dick Winters and men like him.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite portion of the book was Ambrose's reflections on what the unique camaraderie of war is like. Borrowing heavily from Glen Gray's \\"[[ASIN:0803270763 The Warriors: Reflections on Men in Battle]]\\" Ambrose effectively attaches both the 'secret attractions' and horrors of war to the historical men who made up Easy Company.<br /><br />I warmly recommend this entertaining read as a small part of a reader's study and consideration of WWII.s on Men in Battle]]\\" Ambrose effectively attaches both the 'secret attractions' and horrors of war to the historical men who made up Easy Company.

0143119680|1.0|This is the first time I've ever written a review, but I felt compelled to, since this book has gotten so much hype.    I can't do a synopsis, firstly cuz I cannot finish it, and secondly cuz others do that better than I.  But you should know that it is a bore.  I don't like romance novels, or books that tell you how the female protagonist did her hair, her nails, etc... Just get to the meat and bones, which, in this case, are really just too skimpy to make my effort to continue reading it a waste of my time.

1451627289|5.0|I don't usually write reviews for the books of super-popular writers. They don't need my help to get exposure, and my voice would probably get lost in the crowd. But this time around, I really feel compelled to write about Stephen King's new book, 11/22/63, not just because I liked the book so much, but also because I was so fascinated by the ideas in the book.<br /><br />Like King, I lived through the early sixties. I was born in 1959, so I was only four years old when JFK was assassinated. But that event was so shattering, so enormous to ordinary American citizens, for most of my childhood it almost seemed like it had just happened. It seemed that way right into the mid seventies. Also, I lived in Phoenix, Arizona, and though it's the biggest city in Arizona, in the sixties it was a big farming community, with cotton fields stretching as far as the eye could see. Culturally speaking, we were at least a decade behind the America you could see on your TV screen. So JFK still loomed big in our world. Yet the first thing that I read in 11/22/63 that really made me think that time travel might be a wonderful thing to do was not the idea that maybe someone could go back and prevent the assassination of JFK. It was the root beer.<br /><br />I could taste that root beer he described in the book. And in Arizona, that experience had an extra dimension: the root beer was ice cold. If it's 107 degrees outside, and the humidity is less than 5%, drinking an ice cold root beer is a heavenly experience. When I was a kid, I was usually on foot when I went after the root beer, and sometimes I was even foolish enough to go barefoot, though the pavement could be incredibly hot. So the root beer hunt was a perilous adventure, one that offered truly fabulous rewards.<br /><br />Nostalgia clouds our memories of the past. In most books about time travel, that isn't much of an issue - people go way back in time. So in this case, it's interesting that the character is only going back about 50 years. It's even more interesting that he isn't from that decade himself, he won't be born until the mid-seventies. Nostalgia isn't driving him at all, though he certainly develops a healthy dose of it once he's able to experience that root beer, as well as other delightful artifacts. Many other artifacts he encounters are not so delightful: racism, sexism, small town bigotry, and a resistance to putting really good books like Catcher In The Rye in school libraries, where they would actually do the most good. A man without a mission might just visit the past occasionally, stick to the root beer and the inexpensive golden-age comic books, avoid the jerks as much as possible.<br /><br />But Jake (masquerading as \\"George\\") does have a mission. In fact, he has more than one, and the JFK assassination isn't even the most important one. He has another rescue driving him, one that's a lot more personal, a friend whose life was changed by one terrible night when his father murdered the entire family. The friend was the sole survivor of that massacre, and was badly injured. Jake thinks first of him, and that's a good thing. If saving JFK was the only thing on his mind, that would be some serious hubris. Thinking you can stop the massacre of a family is also hubris, but most of us would try to do the same thing if we could. And like Jake, we would find out just how dangerous and daunting that is. First of all, guys who are capable of murdering their entire families possess a terrible vitality, and above-average cunning. Most people have no idea how to fight a dragon like that. So this is one of the many challenges facing Jake.<br /><br />Another challenge is that time itself seems to resist his efforts. The deck is stacked against him. Can he defeat this law of nature? Yes and no, and that's the key to this book. I don't want to spoil it for you by describing what happens, you need to sit at the edge of that seat yourself. But this story really inspired me to reconsider the concept of time travel. Most scientists will tell you it's not possible. But people also said that about traveling faster than Mach 1, and we're way past that now. If you consider that anything is possible, then you have to consider that time travel is one of those possible things. And if it's possible, what are the consequences?  That's what you'll find out when you read 11/22/63.<br /><br />One more thing - I listened to 11/22/63 as an audiobook. The reader, Craig Wasson, was wonderful. He deserves an award for his performance. I'll be looking for more of his work.ll you it's not possible. But people also said that about traveling faster than Mach 1, and we're way past that now.

B0068TJLSY|2.0|This movie was not advertised as such, but was really a teen movie.  I felt like I was watching a Disney horror flick.  It had some scary parts, but it was clearly geared towards teens, so was a disappointment overall.

B000002N2Z|5.0|when i listened this album 15 years ago, i could just say these words; \\"i have never heard anything like this before..\\"  i've felt this 3 times in my life and this album was one of them. it was like a sonic invention to me. the guitar riffs, songwriting and all those raw tunes... it was a great plesure.  people generally like and know deftones from their latter releases. they mention about how mature and stable their sound has turned into, how chino's songwiting has evolved etc.   but as we know from ourselves, getting mature usualy takes away the adrenaline...

0307959856|3.0|I'm afraid I must count myself of another of those disappointed with this book.  Let me say, however, that James is truly a great writer, her Dalgliesh mysteries on the same level as those of Agathie Christie and Dorothy Sayers.  Some of the reviewers have been truly and unnecessarily insulting.  Taking the cake were those who accuse her of not writing the book.  However, the novel's problems is that it is all too obviously James!  I wanted to like this book, but in retrospect, it is clear what went wrong.  Austen is a writer of light, her main topics being courtship and marriage.  James is a writer of darkness, her topics being death and murder.  It is hardly surprising that so dark a writer as James could not pull of a real imitation of Austen, since their styles are antithetical.    I had the same complaint as others about the book's total lack of any of the wit and affection found in Jane Austen.  Elizabeth, especially, seems to have lost all her spunk.  As a gloomy stand-alone mystery set in the Regency period, the book is interesting, but as a sequel to one the most joyous classics of English literature, it fails.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I've been playing solitaire on a computer for 30 years. It was one of the first games that came with a PC. So, perhaps it's because I'm used to the layout with the discards at the bottom as well as the cards dealt, and the aces up at the top that I just can't quite get used to this display. I prefer Solitaire Free Pack by Tesseract Mobile Software even though this one has slightly larger cards. I suppose it you're playing this on a phone, the larger cards would make a big difference, but on the KF, Solitaire Free Pack is the way to go.<br /><br />Two days later: I just can't get used to the layout. If there is another way to display the cards, would somebody please tell me. I haven't found that menu, and it's too difficult to change the way I've been playing solitaire after 50 years.<br /><br />Besides, all games included are in a better format in Solitaire Free Pack.

B001DU8T6S|1.0|\\"the cosmos is rocking with the majestic power of rock\\" sings Rodgers on one of many second rate songs here. It's impossible not to compare Rodgers to Freddie Mercury since Brian May & Roger Taylor insist on using the band name Queen. That being said Rodgers can't measure up to Mercury and on this album (to his credit) really isn't trying to. Nevertheless, I can't help believing a voice and delivery like Mercury's would have turned this unintentionally campy misfire into something interesting. Rodgers is a macho journeyman blues/rock singer. When you add a little Queen pomp (which Mercury could get away with because he was just so out-of-this-world good) with Rodgers' macho crunchiness you run dangerously close to Spinal Tap. There's some great vocal, band moments but no great songs or even very good songs. This album SUCKS
0765365278|5.0|No much can be said other than, you must read this. I love fantasy in general and this just opens up the whole EPICness to what Sanderson is doing. Great job, great book, can't wait for the rest of them.<br /><br />Once you pick it up and get going on it, you can't put it down. Really. It is so good.<br /><br />However, someone liking \\"smaller\\" fantasy like the Inheritance series for example would find this overwhelming. The VASTNESS of the world that has been created is amazing... huge.

B004WE01YA|5.0|Great conversion job. Simply perfect. I could watch it again and again. I have a feeling Disney will be converting \\"The Little Mermaid\\" among other very soon (if not their entire popular collection). Definitely a solid buy!

B00447G2PM|5.0|First and foremost I must say that the 3D in this film is GREAT! I purchased this Blu-Ray and watched it for the first time with friends that I had over for company on my 42\\" Vizio 3D 1080P 240 HZ television. We all LOVED it! It was a blast to watch and the sea creatures showcased are bizarre to say the least. I had never heard of the majority of them. This is my 8th 3D movie to purchase and my 3rd underwater-specific 3D Blu-Ray. It is WELL WORTH THE MONEY! The only thing that beats it is \\"IMAX 3D Under the Sea\\" which features different animals. I would recommend them BOTH. One is incomplete without the other as they showcase entirely different creatures. You won't regret it. I watch it again and again because the images are so detailed and you'll catch new things each time you view it. A+

0385344228|5.0|The less said about this book, the better.  Oh no, not because it's a bad book; far from it.  But because the less you know before you start reading, the better you'll enjoy the ride.<br /><br />And what a ride it is.  If you like gripping courtroom dramas, with an extra dollop of suspense, you'll love this one.  I'm a John Grisham fan, and this is as good as anything he's written.  The most obvious comparison is with Turow's \\"Presumed Innocent\\", which this parallels for a while, before heading off on its own bizarre tangent.<br /><br />I can't find even a single nit-pick.  The characters are starkly drawn, sometimes too much so for comfort.  Every scene is painted and detailed with the care given to a Hollywood set.  And the pacing is dead on, slowing in parts just enough to make you impatient, then bolting off again into another unexpected twist.<br /><br />I seldom use \\"brilliant\\" to describe a book, but it definitely fits here.  You can't just read it, you're sucked right into the pages and have to live the story, squirming all the way.  Like an onion, this book has layer stuck upon layer.  And as with an onion, if you're not careful, you're liable to have a few tears in your eye before you're through.
B005FITIGO|4.0|This movie was far from perfect, as it missed some critical opportunities to educate the viewer, nonetheless is worth watching fro several reasons:<br />The characters are well crafted from both the business perspective and the technical perspective. many of characters were just forced in into a set of actions that quickly became out of their control as the true magnitude of the mess became apparent.<br /><br />2 of the technical people ( Quinto and Tucci's roles) were shown in their native form, they way they viewed their world in an engineering mind set. Quinto's character is particularly naive that felt real.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey and Jeremy Iron's characters as veterans really exposed a seamy side of the whole meltdown business, in that they had no real idea how any of the trading worked in Mortgage backed securities worked in terns of the risks. It was classic as they then had to figure out how to unwind their mess and what i meant for all of banking.<br /><br />Demi Moore's character was way too weak, but maybe that just reflected reality.<br /><br />The way all of the traders and salesmen found a way to justify their terrible actions was a great short view into how easy it is engage in self-delusion in order to feel better about your self. The last scene of Jeremy Irons filling in a cross word puzzle in the executive dining room is classic.<br /><br />The downside of the film fell in two areas, at the key executive meeting, many acronyms were used that assumed the viewer would know, they should have found a way to fill the audience in, especially when all they had to do was associate MBS with Mortgage Backed Securities. way too much implied understanding, especially when they threw around the definition of SWAPs as something no to do. When Quinto's character was explaining the model's failures to his colleague and later with Spacey doing this for Irons, it would have helped to show he graphs they were referring to. Especially since not many people would equate \\"volatility\\" to a concept relating to market \\"trouble\\".<br /><br />when you think about the fact that Both of Dan Brown's Novels/ movies had all of the action take place in 24 hours, and this movie also had all action take place in 24 hours, it represents an interesting contrast in styles. In the case of this movie, the effects are still being felt and it would have been worthwhile making the dilemma a little clearer.uble\\".  when you think about the fact that Both of Dan Brown's Novels/ movies had all of the action take place in 24 hours, and this movie also had all action take place in 24 hours, it represents an interesting contrast in styles.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|I owned this headset from 2009 until Christmas 2012 and while many reviewers out there while I was doing my research on headsets claimed this one had problems, I never experienced any of the issues that people had (maybe I just got lucky? or maybe people just look for problems when they buy something?).   First, let me start with the basic difference between these headphones and all others (including some of Turtle Beache's own headsets)....it's wireless. After trying to set up the Tritton AX PRO's for my little brother over Christmas I can appreciate a lot more how awesome and convenient it is. All I need is the cord that connects from the controller to the headset for voicechat as opposed to a cord to the controller, a cord to the sub controller and a cord to the base unit PLUS all the cords that go along with that.   Set up is also extremely easy, USB is used for power, fiber optic cable for sound (which I actually plug in to my tv instead of the xbox so I can use the headset when I watch movies in my man cave) and since the headset comes paired with the base it's ready to plug and play and then all you need is to control the settings on the console about sound and chat input/output.   The sound is phenomenal, I remember playing Assassin's Creed and there was a scene where I was walking next to a character and I would move my character to the left or right of the person I was walking next to and it would reflect in the headset with the footsteps and voice. It was pretty cool. I also play Battlefield and I noticed that not only could I listen to the footsteps but if I listened closely I could pin point where the fire fight was and even made out silenced weapons. Pretty cool.   The only downfall of this set and the PX5's I just bought is that they run on the same wavelength as your wireless router so if you have a bunch of different toys running wireless you will receive interference.   For example, I set it up for my brother once I returned the Astros and noticedthat in the den the wi-fi on my laptop was really slow (and i tested to make sure it was only in the den) and was noticing that when we played on Xbox Live or the PSN we would disconnect, well lo-and-behold once we unplugged the headset everything returned to normal. I'm pretty sure this happens in their house because they have a G/B wireless router, I have the apple N router base station and have NEVER had this problem. I believe it's because the base station runs on two frequencies at the same time to prevent interference, just food for thought :)  Hope this helps!
B004Y03LQ2|4.0|My wife got this for me as a gift as she knows I'm an IM fan (she's more of a casual fan). Since I don't own NPFTD, FOTD, RIR or AMOLAD, it was good to hear the highlights from those albums. Not too surprising were the BD live vocals on the Blaze era songs which actually are strong compositions. As long as we're including Blaze songs, why not include Lord of the Flies or Futureal?<br />Generally I prefer the individual albums as opposed to compilations, but this is a good set and not a bad price for 2 CD's (2hrs 34 min of music)! So if you're a casual fan of latter day IM or on a tight budget, this is a good deal. Thank you, wifey!

The content is surprisingly clean, although the subject matter (death, violence, starvation, etc) might set some limits for parents with younger kids.  The third installment in the series was enjoyable, with many of the same elements that made the first two books exciting.  In general, though, I did not like this book quite as much as its predecessors.  Most of these feelings have to do with the way that the final few chapters wrapped things up, but those are just my personal preferences.  If you enjoyed the first book, definitely read the second and third installments.

B004LAIU4I|5.0|It has been five years since the release of Paul  Simon's last recording. Produced by the legendary  Brian Eno, \\"Surprise\\" was a brilliant collaboration  that merged Eno's world of electronics and sonic  experimentation with Simon's songwriting in much  the same way that he had previously grafted his  music with African and South American rhythms  or southern gospel music. But with perhaps the  exception of the title track, the songs on \\"Surprise\\"  seemed somewhat cold, distant, and detached.  Which may have been why it didn't connect in a  bigger way with the public.  On the contrary, the music on the new \\"So  Beautiful Or So What\\" invites the listener in, is  warm and embracing, and conveys a casual and  simple nature to the performances that connect  back to Simon's first \\"Paul Simon\\" solo album  from 1972. On that initial solo outing Simon  rejected the grandiose majestic productions of the  later Simon and Garfunkel LPs for a much more  intimate, and rhythmic approach that yielded two  hit singles and solidified his confidence and  direction for a solo career.  Before the release of this new album, Simon  himself compared the coming release with his first  solo LP but much of the recent press comparisons  have been with his breakthrough \\"Graceland\\"  album. I assume that this is because of the new  album's emphasis on rhythms and percussion.  Which is understandable as Simon uses almost  every instrument in a percussive way on the new  album. Vibrato-laden electric guitars, pulsating  bass lines, and even the use of a flute, all work  together to propel the music forward in washes of  near hypnotic rhythmic energy.  But actually, Simon has been a \\"groove\\" oriented  songwriter since the days of Cecilia on \\"Bridge  Over Troubled Water\\" and although some of the  electric guitar figures reflect his \\"Graceland\\" era,  the songs on \\"So Beautiful Or So What\\" seem far  more melody based than the songs on either  \\"Graceland\\" or \\"The Rhythm of the Saints\\".  Whereas the earlier African and South American  songs seemed to begin with rhythms from which  the song structures were crafted, the new album  feels like the songs came first and were then set  within rhythmic frames which come together to  form a wonderfully loose collection where the  songs seem to float casually in and out of  consciousness as they drift easily from one to  another.  Simon's brilliant guitar playing has often been  overshadowed by his stature as a songwriter and  on the new album he really shines on guitar.  There is a wonderful minute and a half long solo  guitar instrumental called \\"Amulet\\" and his own  guitar playing is the foundation for all of the  songs on the album. Much like it was on his  earliest recordings.  There is also an almost traditional \\"blues\\" like  quality to the album with the sparse  instrumentation and casual approach and the  songs have a very \\"primitive\\" nature to them like  accidental Americana \\"folk art\\" cast off on the  side of some mythic delta highway. Not that the  songs actually have a traditional blues structure  or even instrumentation. But they do have a  spirit to them that feels similar to the joyously  spiritual nature of the best traditional blues.  Lyrically the songs connect in much the same  way as the subject matters explored fit perfectly  within each musical painting with many literal  connections to black America whether it be from  the use of samples of the sermons from 1941 of  Reverend J. M. Gates in the opening \\"Getting  Ready For Christmas Day\\" and the Golden Gate  Jubilee Quartet on \\"Love and Blessings\\" to the  lead character crossing the Brooklyn Bridge on  \\"Questions For The Angels\\". The title track  perhaps best reflects this \\"blues\\" inspiration with  again primitive guitar figures repeating and  supporting an uplifting lyric that like the rest of  the album moves from darker images toward a  spiritual redemption that Simon seems to have  been chasing his entire life.  Highly recommended, \\"So Beautiful OrSo  What\\" has Paul Simon coming full circle in his  songwriting. This could be his \\"Bringing it all  Back Home\\" album. And he's brought back  everything he's learned along the way with him.  Gilbert Hetherwick  Hetherwick@mac.com  I welcome letters, comments, or writings from  others.

B006QPVH6O|4.0|Unlike many of the other reviewer's, I liked this movie. The acting was very well done and the limited budget was well used. The most eerie effect of the film was the ability to portray the confined quarters of the old Apollo spacecraft and the absolute isolation of being on the moon. Couple the films ability to portray those factors with the other factors that I wont mention so as to not spoil the movie for anyone, made for a nice surprise movie that was well done.<br />You might as well ignore this review as I have learned to ignore most of the reviewers on this site. I have rented and purchased highly recommended movies only to be angered at wasting my money on garbage and have rented and purchased lowly rated movies, like this one, only to be pleasantly surprised. Though not a universal occurrence I have found that like certain bodily orifices, everybody has opinions and they are all....well, I don't need to go on.<br />I recommend this film. The rental price is right and it is better than most fairly recent releases in the horror genre.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I recognize that a \\"To-Do\\" and task app is very much subject to personal preference. With that said I've tried about a 6 or 7 and resigned myself to the fact that Android has sucky task apps. I tried this app when it was the Free App of the Day, and it is the best Android task app I've found so far.  The sync with google tasks works flawlessly (something I've had problems with on other apps) and it has a widget that is actually useful. I'm withholding the 5th star because the widget has no configuration options for sorting. I want to be able to sort by task list first, then priority second. This one, like most, sorts by importance first and alphabetical second.

Don't get me wrong, overall I would recommend TNOTW to anyone searching for a good, solid fantasy to sink their teeth into, but even though I enjoyed the book, there were plenty of bumps inside the book that kept jarring me back to reality. I'm just going to break it down in point form...  PLOT: TNOTW consists of a story within a story along with several other stories within that story. Sorry, I just had to say that. The main character, Kvothe, tells his life story to a scribe, and along the way he includes plenty of folklore that adds to the richness of the world that Rothfuss has created. Overall, I loved Kvothe's story, especially his days at the University. I applaud the care that Rothfuss has taken in creating the atmosphere of study. He doesn't skimp on the details when it comes to the lessons and I was completely immersed in this wonderful world of alchemy and medicine and all sort of other interesting subjects. The amount of research that Rothfuss has done into each subject is admirable and I love the level of detail he includes in the book.  CHARACTERIZATION: So here's where the 2 stars came off for me. Up until Kvothe meets Denna again in Imre, I had been enjoying the book. Kvothe's back story, his lessons with Abenthy, his interview at the University...loved every bit of it. When he met Denna on the way to the University, I didn't think much of it. I thought of her as a passing character, lovely and forgettable. But when Rothfuss installed her as the main love interest, I was truly disappointed. Denna is indescribably beautiful, so *~mysterious~* that she has to change to her name regularly, and utterly stereotypical. Where Kvothe is complex and fully fleshed out (He's brilliant, cunning etc, but he's also cocky and his arrogance lands him in trouble plenty of times. In other words, he's flawed, which makes him that much more believable.) Denna to me reeks of imaginary girlfriend. I searched for any signs of complexity in her character that would make me believe in her...but no. Up until the end of the book, she remains what she always was before: nothing more than a character to serve as a crutch. It's as though Rothfuss thought: I need a love interest for Kvothe. And out comes Denna.  I have nothing against beautiful female characters in fantasy when they are believable. When they have their own motivations and are flawed and don't seem like a mere prop to the story. For example, Daenerys from SOIAF is known by many in the book as the most beautiful woman in the world, but she's more than just a pretty face for men to drool over. She has her own battles to fight, her own mistakes to make, and her own dreams to reach. Actually, come to think of it, any female character in SOIAF is much more believable than Denna. Even Sansa, who on the surface is the stereotypical mild-mannered, ladylike damsel in distress, is a character so well-developed I hear her voice loud and clear when I read the book.  Coming back to TNOTW, I got the feeling as I read the book that women are nothing more than mystical creatures to be admired from afar. All the female characters in TNOTW are \\"beautiful\\" and characterless. Aura, the eccentric girl Kvothe comes across in the University, is a skinnier, less interesting version of Luna Lovegood. Fela and Mola might as well be the same girl.  Speaking of which, the same goes from Simmon and Wil, Kvothe's best friends in the University. Once again, I got the impression that Rothfuss simply thought: Kvothe needs good friends at the Uni. I didn't care much about them. I couldn't care less if anything were to happen to them. They seemed less like characters and more like props to the story.  Aside from Kvothe, the only characters that held my interest were Elodin, Skarpi, and Pike. The scene where Kvothe discovers Pike's hidden stash of valuables, which includes (amongst other things) charcoal drawings of a woman's face, a bundle of dried violets, and a lock of curling blond hair, was really quite poignant and turned Pike from just another bully to someone very much like Kvothe. Unfortunately, like Skarpi, Pike's appearance in the book was short-lived.  WRITING: Despite the mundane side characters, like I said before, overall I really enjoyed the book, and this is one of the reasons why. Rothfuss has a way with words that makes his scenes come alive. The writing in TNOTW is rich without being purple (except for the times where he describes Denna, then it does have a tendency to become excessive and eye-roll-inducing), and the pace of the book is nicely evened out. I know quite a few people didn't like the breaks in between Kvothe's narrative, but I found them to be a nice breather and if anything, they added to my curiosity and made me even more interested to know how he came to meet Bast and decide to settle down as an innkeeper.  So there you have it. I've bought the second book and am really looking forward to reading it, but I genuinely hope that between the first and the second book, Rothfuss would take the time to pour more life into his side characters.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Good graphics on the KF very solid game! Easy to learn and will keep you immersed in the story line for hours.
B004LZEV4Q|5.0|This is one of our son's favorite books, so he loved unwrapping it during his first Christmas! My husband and I both work, so this is a great way for our son to hear our voices reading to him when we aren't home. The recordable book is easy to set up and enjoyable for the whole family!
1410443256|1.0|I loved this book but I definitely bought it in the store. List price for this book is $17.99. Isn't the point of this site to get it for less?
B003ASLJS6|5.0|The movie came right in on time and was in perfect condition and not to mention it is a great movie.
B005KXT58U|4.0|Amy Lee brings back her captivating voice and lyrics to this, Evanescence's third studio album. Only Lee herself and Terry Balsamo remain from The Open Door, leading to a new, more mainstream sound for the band. After countless disputes among former band members and lineup shuffles, I really hope that Evanescence can stick with this groove and make it work. The tracks on this eponymous album flow pretty well together, but only a few really stand out as great.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I must have forgot to review this. Its a pretty good cd with alot of new stuff by others singers aswell as Eminem.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|At times the special effects can be so overwhelming that only the diehard Green Lantern fans are not going to feel lost in the story and unfortunately the story goes into the background of the special effects rather than blending in with it all. What could have been a good to very good film turns out to just be lackluster overall. The tale follows the pulpy feel of the Green Lantern comics and lots of known characters are in the tale. A viewer gets a pretty good idea of the overall universe upon universes in the Green Lantern world as well.<br /><br />That said, unlike better films, it just doesn't ring true for the non fans and with a budget like they had they needed a ton of non Green Lantern fans to fill up the seats. Close but no cigar if you look at the numbers. There was a later extended cut on DVD that added 19 minutes or so but I'm not sure if that fixed the overall problem. Marketing/Promotion for this film was $100M and overall budget was roughly $219M yet it yielded just a bit under $220M at the Box Office so there may not be a Green Lantern 2.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; SPECIAL EFFECTS: B; TRUE TO GREEN LANTERN: B; WHEN WATCHED: early January 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B minus (less for non Green Lantern fans).
0439023491|5.0|I usually do not have high expectations for second books of trilogies, but this one exceeded my expectations. It is a great book, just as the first one. The audiobook is very well recorded and narrated.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Two things make this film unique for me.  The first is that it examines the willing culpability of a group separate from the Nazis - in this case, the French government.  The suffering the French government inflicted upon its own citizens - all in the name of ethnic cleansing - is shocking, heartbreaking and all too-familiarly horrifying in its execution.  Sadly the French were far from alone in such actions.<br /><br />However, the most important point that this film illustrates is the post-traumatic aftermath of such human suffering. Despite the loving support of her adopted French family and the subsequent love of a caring, doting husband and precious son, Sarah could not overcome or come to terms with the pain and loss she endured during the Holocaust.  Like with the brilliant and prolific, Primo Levi, the horror of those experiences was simply too much to bear.<br /><br />The film is wonderful in the telling of the story and its current-day impact on those who previously felt they had no connection with those events of 60+ years ago.  But, ultimately, it's Sarah's story: of loss, of attempted rebuilding and ultimate self-sacrifice in the face of such overwhelming trauma.  It is not an uncommon story in Holocaust history, but one which rarely gets addressed.  Here, it is done with courage and thoughtfulness.
0545091020|5.0|The audiobook is very well narrated by Carolyn McCormick; Its fun to hear and kind of addictive. The story is super interesting and keep you engage. I will deferentially recommend this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|overall,  it is simple, fun and some what addictive. well worth the download. it would be great for kids. I have. not tried the up grade yet but am planning on it
B004VMUS9G|5.0|wonderful alarm clock w/ great options!  I have mine set to start quietly and gradually get louder -nice sound options that are not annoying or abrupt.  Also has the option to wake up to a Pandora playlist (which I just noticed and have not used yet)  had paid money for a different alarm app and complained to my husband that you couldn't set the alarm for specific days of the week. he told me he had this free app with which you could, so deleted the other one.  nice not to have to remember to set my alarm every other day!  thanks to the creators of this great app!
0553381407|5.0|Oh I was in the middle of group and one-on-one therapy to rid myself of the demons of parental abuse when I picked up this book and it took me TWO months to read through. As I read it from cover to cover, I was astonished by the descriptions of what some parents said to their children because -- Word For Word it was EXACTLY what my abusive parent would say to me!! Needless to say this book brought out some very painful emotions and I was VERY difficult to live with during the 2 months it took to read it. However, it achieved a BEAUTIFUL cleansing of my emotions, memories and my soul. Did I totally recover? Of course not -- IMHO, recovery from parental abuse is like the Law Of Diminishing Returns. I do THANK the author for helping me climb a very steep hill, and reaching ONE of its summits breathing and thinking alot clearer and HAPPIER.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Knowing my daughter had her 6mo. Dr. visit coming up I typed up her daily schedule and all my questions and concerns for the Dr.  ( I know there are specific apps for that but they cost $ and do things I don't need ) This helped me to remember everything and stay organized.  Its nothing too special, but runs smoothly on kindle fire and is super easy to use.  Also, I plan to use it for my shopping list as well. Plus you can't beat free!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app is awesome.. Not a moon pro so cant point out any off details but since I'm sure they will be worked out I know this app is a keeper! Kudos to the brain who thought this up and made it happen.. This app has given me a renewed interest, and this app will likely be another bed time ritual. . the experimental DSS looks great on my K fire, graphics awesome, details and info awesome! Thanks for the freebie, gotta love the educational apps... grreeeaat.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I got these movies for my husband for Christmas and he just loved them.  He likes Matt Damon and the action that was in this trilogy.  I would but them again if I needed to so that he would stay happy.

B0063GORYU|5.0|great game. just like the classic spider game loved by all solitary fans. would recommend it to anyone who loves card games and wants spider game for your kindel I pad or phone.
0439023483|5.0|I was curious about all the fuss regarding this triology.  Was not disappointed. I loved this triology and I am hoping that the movie will remain true to the books.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|Zero character development and zero suspense equals zero interest. Too many talented actors with too little to work with. Total meh.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|I have never reviewed a product before, but the poor quality of this cover left me no choice. The flap that bends back and supports the Fire by seating into a shallow groove is just too flimsy, and the groove is so shallow that the cover doesn't support the Fire. The whole thing collapses spontaneously or if lightly touched. I had to cut an adhesive strip and afix along the groove so that the flap would remain in place. I wouldn't have cared so much if the price of the cover were less, but for $29.99 I expected it to work.
B0063IH60K|4.0|very fun to play. I wish the random plays had more winning games. I like to play this game because I don't always have Internet connection and this still can be played
1591843790|5.0|Although this book is aimed at those who are setting up a business and producing a product, trying to create a market for their product (I think), I am not a person of this ilk. However, I found it an excellent read. It is short sharp and snappy and it has a lot of really useful advice - even for a person like me who is just interested in how to create good impressions, how to work well with people, and how to find enchantment in all areas of my life, both at work and in my social life. I really liked the short scenarios or personal case studies at the end of each chapter - it adds reality to the book and makes you realise what a magnet Guy Kawasaki is.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I take a lot of photos of the moon and nature.  These photos are fantastic. This app also provides a slew of Info. Thank you to the creator(s) and Amazon for letting us have this for free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT BEGINNING FOR NEW KINDLE USERS TO GET BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR SYSTEM PLUSH THE PRICE IS RIGHT.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the little games on this app. Just wish it didn't take so long to get coins trot the later ones.
140053271X|5.0|Great product, with simple yet quality construction.  Screen is easy to read, and page turns are some of the fastest on the market.  The big plus would be the fact that is supports the epub format which is widely available, something the Kindle does not do.  This makes it easier to obtain books from sources other than the Nook Store. Battery life is stellar, got it for christmas, and fully charged it that day.  Have read 3 books so far, and still have about 50% battery left.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is pretty fun but sometimes they don't explain the games enough. lots of games blah blah blab blah
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have always loved this Christmas classic!!!  Natalie Wood is adorable and actor who plays Kris Kingle is totally believe-able.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so fun but some are a little hard I downloaded this game before but it didn't meet my standards and now that they improved it its perfe
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the game that brings back fond memories of childhood.  My grandmother would bake and try to work around my grandfather who could do nothing but take up precious kitchen space playing hours of traditional Solitaire at the kitchen table. Great game!
B001U887U6|2.0|THESE SHOES ARE WAY OVERSIZED.THE SIZING CHART SAYS TO ORDER HALF SIZES ONE SIZE LARGER AND THEY ARE SO HUGE I SWIM IN THEM.THEY ALSO ARE TOO WIDE FOR MY NARROW FOOT. I WILL NOT ORDER ANY MORE.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm always the last one off the bus and i get really bored but this passes time and me and my friend both try to best the challenging levels! its fun!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are a challenge and require you to use your brain.  They could also entertain you for hours at a time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is good and fun but the point of unlocking each game for points you earn ruins the fun factor of the game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is totally awesome I really like it. Don't worry if u have a Kindle Fire it really works unlike the stupid test and the moron test. There are a lot of games on here but beware A LOT of advertisments. No real Money required. So basicly you can play games to earn coins and purchase more games. Some games cost more than others . To sum it up a lot of fun games especially for u if u like challenges.
B000AYQJ3I|4.0|I gave this CD as a Christmas gift to my brother in law.  It was the perfect gift, he loved it and listens to it all the time.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|great app that allows you to control your Pc or laptop from anywhere with your kindle fire or phone. i use it on my kindle fireand I have zero complaints
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got it while it was the free app of the day, and i'm so glad I did. Works better than team viewer; I can watch media center and create and watch powerpoint presentations. Downside is that it  doesn't seem as secure as team viewer and of course isn't usually free. Easy to install and has ios apps. Great!<br /><br />PS.  I'm using a galaxy tab 10.1 and also have the ios version on iPhone 4. Both are vanilla. Also connecting to two win7 PCs.
0061433063|4.0|My 11-year old loves this book -- he's read the other Terry pratchett books and says this one is as good as Wee Free Men.
630469654X|5.0|It came in a timely amount of time.  I don't know if it works yet.  our Dvd is not connnected.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|update...<br /><br />After never redeeming the UV code, or installing Flixster since last Christmas, I had read that Warner Brother's was extending the expiration dates. AND, if you goto their website and fill out the support form, they would email an iTunes Digital Copy code.  I did, they did, and now I have a iTunes redemption code!  Very happy!  If I read the email correctly, they also state that the movie would be available via the Flixster app IF I chose to signup and use the original code as well.  Choices are always good in this case.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app has given me a great guidance to start learning about the Bible. It's simple and basic to use. The app can be used by those like me just starting out or those who are very knowledgeable with the Bible already.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game is fun, thought-provoking, and relaxing. Peaceful music. Part of why I bought the game was to find out how a game could be all these things. Well, with the great reviews, pay the $.99 and find out yourself!
159102594X|1.0|450 pages into the book and there still is no plot anywhere in sight.  Not a single likeable character. It's like the author doesn't even know himself where he wants the story to go. I finish every book I read but I'm not sure I can do it with this one.
B005R4255C|5.0|This new cd is full of already released tracks by Michael Jackson, but they have been \\"created again\\" by the team of Cirque du Soleil. And they did absolutely wonderful job. The combinations of various songs won't leave you cold. You can also recognize parts of rare songs like \\"Somebody's watching me\\" by Rockwell & Michael Jackson. I hope they keep up the good work with the show also. Put the cd in your player and listen, you won't regret.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I truly loved every minute and I'll watch it again and again and again.  Very moving and so special.  So many amazing capture.  I bought it mostly for my son to watch, but I found myself loving it so much that I don't want to miss a minute of it.  Struck me very much on a personal basis to and I vow to make some changes in my personal life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loved it. very fun game. the points system. is great and easy to accumulate points to unlock games. fun and addictive.
1904994679|5.0|DeJvu,  Read Guinness when I was a lad of 10.  Always fun to expand your awareness of the world we live in.  This book is hardcover and sturdy.  My grandson loves going through the pages and seeing the weird and strange from around the world.  Not something he will get in the traditional educational system.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app rocks! It is perfect  for students  I can keep all my textbooks on my system at home then access  them from tablet or phone  . It's a life saver
0307949486|5.0|For a week, this book was my constant companion...I read a chapter in the supermarket parking lot, the doctor's waiting room, and the auto repair shop. I could not put it down in spite of the ton of extraneous detail and the mind numbing collection of characters with Swedish names who sometimes appear never to be heard vfrom again. I confess thast in spite of its shortcomings, the book invaded my mind till the last page. Reminds me of some early British drawing room mysteries. Don't be3 put-off, just be prepared!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app really lives up to the hype. daily plans allow for devotions on the go. easy functionality and hardly ever freezes.
B001HC8516|1.0|Frankly I just did not enjoy this book and wish I hadn't spend 12 dollars on it. I wanted to punch the author in the face from the get-go. While I appreciate the intention of the book, the author is condescending and patronizing towards women [\\"at 0400 (that's 4 am, ladies!)\\"] Just irritated me.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great combo Blue Ray/DVD/Digital, thanks.  Please take note, I DID NOT buy HP 8 because the digital copy was Flixster -- I don't want a 3 year rental and commitment to that company.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun for it being free, good for killing time, biggest neg is the ad interruptions, which occur randomly, nice variety and good entertainment value
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The trailer looked dumb, but I was extremely surprised to see how good this movie actually was.  I enjoyed how they made it mytical, yet believable with the real world aspects.  I am very much looking forward to seeing The Avengers this coming summer 2012!
B005CM9DX6|4.0|You can't please everybody. Mikael Akerfeldt is way past trying and bless his heart. As someone who has a healthy appreciation for all the top shelf prog bands of the days of yore, I was very appreciative on first listen recognizing musical passages that displayed such heavy influence from those bands (it's hard not to hear King Crimson on the main stanza of \\"The Devil's Orchard\\" and when it picks up steam during \\"Famine\\") and my enjoyment has only grown stronger with each repeated play. I'd like to note that I've always been a fan of the hard and heavy Opeth but they've never been my go-to band for death metal brutality and I think that's where a lot of disappointment stems for lots of people. What's disappointing from a songwriting aspect is the unparalleled talent Akerfeldt and crew have had on albums past for pairing gorgeous acoustic sections with the jarringly heavy. It was their catch. A good example of this can be found as recently as 2005's \\"Baying of the Hounds\\". The song is a journey through the band's capabilities, virtuously juxtaposing those gorgeous guitars with haunting hard moments that get my heart racing everytime I hear it, ending in a refrain that's at once cinematic and sweeping, wrapping up over minutes as not one second wasted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing on Heritage quite hits those peaks and valleys of the best material the band has released. The good news is every single song is unique and is sonically standout from the rest of the catalog. The progressive homages in lesser hands might be a gimmick to cover up poor ideas, but this fear was put to rest the second I heard the music. There's so much love for Mike's influences spilling forth in these songs. Organ is everywhere, adding a genuine archaic feel to the proceedings. The dynamic range is simply stunning. The quiet moments beg to be cranked up and when the guitars get overdriven you might be surprised by how loud they really are without being what one typically thinks of as \\"metal\\". \\"Nepenthe\\" and \\"I Feel the Dark\\" highlight this excellently. Once again Steven Wilson has done a great job behind the mixing board in this age of brickwalling.<br /><br />To summarize, this is Akerfeldt's loveletter to the bands that fueled his creative muse just as much as the death metal stalwarts did when Opeth first started. Taken on its own merits, it's a very rewarding listen that aesthetically fits into the band's catalog and despite breaking from their signature sound, it all feels canonized. It will be interesting to hear where Mikael takes the band on their next observation...nthe\\" and \\"I Feel the Dark\\" highlight this excellently.

The humor is GREAT!!!  I couldn't stop laughing... I absolutely love this movie.  I just wish it came with a digital copy!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|tries to get you to download more crap. don't waste your time on this one. uninstalled and will avoid other apps by nordcurrent
B002ZG99CM|5.0|I didn't expect this movie to be great seeing as remakes are usually a let down, but this movie is very good!  It's called the Karate kid, but its more like the Kung Fu kid, but it is entertaining never the less.  It is a good story and good fun for the whole family.
B00511ONPG|5.0|I Didn't know how to engage my customers on Facebook and tweeter, I mean, I sell Services (3d Architectural advertising) for Developers and Realtors, so my target is not as big as selling cakes for example.<br />This book told me how to get \\"engaged\\" with my niche, it gave me a lot of ideas so I can increase the \\"Likeable Factor\\" on my company, my short staff and clients!. REALLY GOOD BOOK.<br /><br />PS: When I finished the book, I rated it with 5 starts from my kindle (to Facebook and twetter). 1 hour later I've got a tweet from Dave (the Author) saying \\"Muchas Gracias\\" I mean, First of all, I didn't have him on any of my social media contacts so who knows how he found that info that fast and, most important, he even took the time to learn I speak spanish since I live in Colombia, that's exactly what this book is about. , KUDOS For DAVE!
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I watch \\"That Metal Show\\" religiously and one week they recommended \\"Black Country Communion\\" on the show as their \\"pick of the week\\" and I marked it down to look at sometime later. After seeing Glenn Hughes play on the show and be interviewed, coupled with seeing the video for \\"Last Soul\\" on youtube, I pulled the trigger and bought the CD, and I am so glad that I did. The driving bass of Glenn Hughes on the opening title track grabs you by the ear and yanks you along into a great hard rock album. I love every song (although \\"Last Soul\\" and \\"Black Country\\" are highlights to be sure). For a man of Mr. Hughes' age, his voice and range are great. It may be a back handed compliment, but with the quick time (less than a week or so to record the album) and low budget, you can be pretty sure that we are hearing the audio pretty much as it was recorded, with little to no gloss or polish. As soon as I can scrape the money together, I'm buying the second album. Great Great stuff, like a lost \\"Rainbow\\" record fell from the sky.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|People should know by now the concept of these movies, \\"You can't cheat death.\\" With this people either love or hate these movies. Watch one of them and you will know what you fall under. I for one, cannot get enough of these movies and I am happy that they are currently filming 6 & 7 simultaneously.
0393338827|5.0|Mike Lewis has this gift of making the subject look so appealing, whereas others would only succeed to bore readers into a technicality of a CDS/CDO. The characters developed, introduced, revisited at perfect times. Mike Burry, Gregg Lippman, Steve Eisman were the smart guys. Most of the rest were just too 'busy' to think. The fact that Lewis was not one of the players make it such an objective narration that's far more believable than most other I've heard.  This narration, with others, are continuously confirming my suspicion that most on WS don't have a f&*@ing clue of what they are doing. Unfortunately, it's equally true today as it was in 2007-8. As long as the confidence of the dumb will be preferred over humility of the smart; we'll keep running into these messes.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Unlike the I pad ans iPhone versions of PvZ, this is a lazy port. Regardless of which Android device you are using, the text will be blurry and the visuals look terrible.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is one of our family's favorite board games!  It's one that truly only takes 30 minutes to play, so even with so little time at the end of a day, this game allows us to spend quality time together!  Also, a huge plus is that this game is awesome as an educational tool for younger kids.  All the game pieces are in different shapes and have different number of tiles.  It makes you think about the number and shape as you place each piece on the game board.  Highly recommended!

B001223BLU|5.0|I met the 4 Seasons through the Jersey Boys. This has been a great way enjoy the originals. Having a bit of the back story on the group through the show has made them all the more enjoyable. I'd recommend this album to anyone new to the group and the show to any long term 4 Seasons fans.
1416914285|5.0|My Thoughts: Yep, I might be the last person to jump on the Mortal Instruments band wagon. I finally read City Of Bones. What did I think? I thought it was freaking amazing and I loved it!<br /><br />We are introduced to Jace who is a shadowhunter and Clary who has lived a normal life. Along with her best friend Simon, Clary is thrust into the Shadowhunter world. She never even knew these people existed.<br /><br />Oh gosh, how can I summarize this book and not give away anything or everything?<br /><br />Vampires exist, werewolves exist; so many creatures that Clary thought were fairy-tales exist.<br /><br />Clary's mom is taken, and Clary is left to find her.<br /><br />Clary learns who she really is in City Of Bones.<br /><br />Instead of giving away the whole plot and everything in the book, let's talk about the boys. Simon and Jace. Simon is Clary's best friend, a mere human or mundane. I could tell he was a sweet patient guy who I could see myself falling for. As for Jace, he's a Shadowhunter and perfect to me in every way. He has tattoos, he's a bad boy, he fights, he's good with weapons, and he's not too bad to look at either.<br /><br />Clary is torn between both boys I could tell from the get go. She's attracted to Jace but Simon has always been there. What team am I??? Right now, I think I'm more team Jace.<br /><br />What happens to Clary and her friends? Who is she \\"really\\"? Read the book to find out!!<br /><br />Overall: I'm not going to go on and on about this one, because everyone and their dog has already read and reviewed it. I will just say that I loved it. I loved the characters, I loved learning all about the Shadowhunters and their past. I LOVED THIS BOOK! I can't wait to dive into the next book! Oh man, so excited! I haven't been immersed in a book like this in a long time.<br /><br />Cover: It's neat. I like all the covers! Fits perfectly!<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />_________________<br />Review Based On Hardcover Edition<br /><br />Taken From Princess Bookie
B005VT42BS|5.0|I was looking for a network app, for my Kindle Fire that would give me all of the network connection parameters and this one is it! The very best I've seen.[[ASIN:B005VT42BS Fing - Network Tools]]
0312641893|5.0|My Thoughts: Every once in a while you come across a book that takes your breathe away, that is amazing, and that you want to recommend to all of your friends. Cinder is one of those books. It does start of a bit slow but by 30, I was hooked. Totally hooked where I couldn't stop reading.<br /><br />Cinder is a mechanic but that isn't all she is. She is special, she has a family where she doesn't really fit in because she's different. She's a cyborg. Her stepmother doesn't feel like she's one of them, she doesn't have feelings, and can't really be true to common things such as crying or being compassionate but we can tell from the get go, she does feel things. She truly understands what its like to be human.<br /><br />Cinder is basically an orphan, her family suffered a terrible crash and she barely made it out. She was than taken by a man, who also died and his wife took Cinder in. She's never really known what is was like to be a part of a family that appreciated her. She has a cyborg foot and hand.<br /><br />Cinder works as a mechanic in Commonwealth. She is good at her job. She can fix most things. One day, the prince comes to her booth to ask for her help to fix his old android. His name is Kai, and she thinks he is very handsome but does her best to avoid the temptations of swooning over him like all the other girls in the world.<br /><br />Let's talk about Kai for a minute. He is next in line to be emperor of Eastern Commonwealth. Kai was very handsome from Cinder's descriptions. But not only that, he also has a personality and is very likable. He's funny, snarky, and seems like even though he has to be serious, this guy can totally warm your heart. There was something about Kai that instantly drew me to him and I ended up falling in love with him. He was so darn sweet.<br /><br />Cinder's sister Peony comes down with the Plague, which has been inhabiting earth for a while now, people are dying, nobody can sustain it. Including Kai's father who is also sick.<br /><br />After Cinder's sister Peony comes down with the Plague, her stepmother volunteers her for the cyborg draft; to help scientists find a cure for the Plague. In the process, it also kills the volunteers.<br /><br />Cinder gets a stunning surprise when she gets tested.<br /><br />All the meanwhile, Kai is on the verge of marrying the Queen Of Lunar to acquire a truce between the two planets. This way, he figures they won't attack.<br /><br />Kai also doesn't know she is a cyborg or any kind of special. He likes her, but in his eyes, she's just a normal citizen and a girl at that.<br /><br />This world is filled with political struggles and you'll never see most of the events coming. You'll be stunned, you'll want to punch things, and by the end you'll be desperately wishing you had the next book in the series.<br /><br />I loved all the futuristic talk. The hovers, the netscreens, androids, different kinds of people. Different species basically. I loved the comm talk, the way they could communicate.<br /><br />Cinder isn't who everyone thinks she is. She's definitely unique. Not only her personality, but everything about her is amazing and different. I loved her voice. She is so real.<br /><br />This book is basically a retelling of Cinderella but in my opinion it's just so different, its a whole new level of Cinderella. It's amazing. It's graceful. It's perfect.<br /><br />Overall: Cinder was absolutely whole heartily freaking great. I loved Cinder, I loved Kai, I loved all the secondary characters, I loved her sister, I loved her android. Cinder is an interesting debut! And that cliffhanger, next book now please.....<br /><br />Cover: This cover is amazing. I love it. And it represents the story perfectly. I love how we can see her cyborg foot. And love the red heels.<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 5/5 Cupcakes<br />_____________<br />Review Based On Hardcover Edition<br /><br />Taken From Princess Bookieh the Plague, her stepmother volunteers her for the cyborg draft; to help scientists find a cure for the Plague.

B004HO6I2E|1.0|Terrible movie.  The language is foul and drug use is part of the movie.  I didn't finish the movie.  It was trash.
1416914293|5.0|My Thoughts: Right after I finished City Of Bones, I had to start City Of Ashes. And now after that ending, I want to start the third right away!<br /><br />We are back with Clary and all her gang. They are trying to stop the bad guy and a bunch of obstacles stand in the way. Some people don't trust Jace anymore and there are more rivals throughout this novel than friends.<br /><br />City Of Ashes is another book you need to read. I haven't been this engrossed in a series since I read the Hunger Games.<br /><br />I love all the characters even more than I did when I read the first book. These books are so amazing and addicting.<br /><br />This is another short review, to say I loved this book. I don't want to give anyone any real spoilers and the people who haven't read this novel need to read it. I think it would be even better if I hadn't known a key detail when I started this series. I'm sure most of you know what I'm talking about. I had heard it on twitter and it would have been so much more stunning to find out if I hadn't started the book already knowing.<br /><br />Overall: Loved loved loved loved it! Did I mention that I loved it? Great series! Need more now!<br /><br />Cover: Like it.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun and can give you hours of it. I would recommend this game for people who like challanges and games.that get.the brain flowing
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it! Its definatly not my favorite but its my backup game to angry birds :) good game for younger people under 16 not really a fun adult game. My 4 yr.old cousin loves it though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game. I love it. it is so fun to play when I'm bored at school, home, and on the way to my basketball game.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|very funny movie and it was a xmas gift for my 21 year old and he loes it too. it came in very good condition and good quality picture.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I really love it although you use score to buy games it is pretty cool very very very good game
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I installed the application on my GS and Touchpad. Been working well on both. Occasional intermittent disconnects, but immediate reconnects. Found performance to be desktop equivalent, but with a touch interface. Change the resolution and you've got Windows 7 on a portable device. You can even stream video with not-quite intolerable to acceptable quality.  I recommended this over another app, the one that Groupwatches. That exhibits considerable lag and doesn't have the true touch interface. Splashtop allows you to use the screen as touch pad or directly tap on things an the cursor will simulates click there.  I highly recommend this app. Excellent utility. No perceivable lag in use :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an amazing app..I would recomend it to anyone of my friends. its my favorote app out of all of them.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|This is about as close as you can get to the perfect western, great cast from top to bottom and the scenery and filming are top notch.  I don't think Lee Marvin ever gave a stronger, more nuanced performance in his career and for once Jack Palance seemed like a real person.  It has humor, action, love, sadness and a real story to tell.  It is set in the last days of cowboys and the small ranchers, everything is changing and it really catches some of the characters unprepared.  I can recommend this to any film buff whether you like western or not its just great to watch.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was overwhelmingly surprised when I saw my Fire connecting to my Win7 PC with a full desktop.  Performance is great, latency ok, smooth zooming...  A must have for Fire, highly recommended!  PS1: You need to install remote streamer on your PC first.  PS2: Saw windows basic prompt, ok after set not to ask again.  PS3: Built-in Fire on screen keyboard works smoothly, but OSK blocked the view-able area make it difficult to see my inputs from screen.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|101 games is free so I didn't expect that. much but it ok. I give it 3 stars because its okay. thank you 4 Bsd graphics but other wiseok
1451627289|4.0|There is a subchapter were the hero states \\"An author should keep his story simply.\\" Wish Mr King would have taken his own advise. For me, too many subchapters recapping previous subchapters. Don't get me wrong, this book is a great read. The history behind the stories is what I liked most. Thought I had the ending after 200 pages. Was I wrong.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Yes, claiming that this is the best series on TV is a high claim. For me, it's true. This season starts w/ a bit of a learning curve, but the core elements of the show never waver (eternal struggle, good/evil, a love triangle). After the show hits it's stride, it's pure, awesome, fast-paced fun. I can remembered dying to see the next episode only 2 episodes in.   Not to mention the cast is completely sexy, and the love triangle is smokin' (You'll root one minute for Stefan and the next for Damon). I love vampires and always have, but this show is indeed more then that. It also, after a few episodes, transcends them being in high school so that it's not hitting you over the head constantly, making this show watchable for an older demographic as well. If you think you could like this show even a smidgen, CHECK IT OUT. You will not be disappointed. I can not once remember aching for a new episoes every week w/ any other show but this one. Rewatching this season for like the 3-4 time has me off to buy season 2 on DVD today.
0312641893|5.0|\\"Cinder\\" really does live up to its pre-launch hype. I admit some trepidation upon hearing it was a cyborg Cinderella tale. It sounded a bit silly. Wow, was I wrong. Author Marissa Meyer has so cleverly crafted her tale, you forget about that silly glass slipper from that childhood princess book. It's proof that a gifted writer can make words sing.<br /><br />And Marissa is a gifted writer. Her prose is clean and thoughtful. There's no rambling thoughts or stray words unless specifically attributed to a character's personality. Her dialogue is flows naturally and her descriptions quickly help readers construct Cinder's world in their minds. My one complaint -- I don't want to wait for the next book. I would have been perfectly happy if Marissa had kept going with the story.<br /><br />What spoke to me the most throughout the book was Marissa's treatment of character interactions. I love Cinder's bantering friendship with the android Iko and her sisterly respect for Peony, who has a loveable flightiness to her. When Cinder interacts with Kai and Dr. Erland we see whole new dimensions.<br /><br />I was one of the lucky reviewers who not only read an advanced copy, but listened to an advanced copy of the \\"Cinder\\" audiobook as well. The audiobook is amazing. It's a toss-up as to whether I prefer it to the paper version, and that's saying something.<br /><br />Read by Rebecca Soler, \\"Cinder\\" truly comes to life. Rebecca reads each character with different accents, and she does it so well it's at times hard to tell the same person is reading the entire text. Cinder's spirit really comes alive through Rebecca, and I found myself focusing on different elements throughout the story because of it.  It's a long recording -- more than eight hours -- but totally absorbing and well worth listening to.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is okay for passing time. Its true you need to get points to unlock games, but they give you a lot of free points along the way.
0007437269|4.0|Good story, but the telling of the story is slow and short. Short is probably a good thing for this book. However, as a horse lover, I am glad I bought it for my library. I'm also thinking that this is one case where the movie will be better!
B004FOA84A|5.0|cool graphics, challenging at times, will agree that its too short. I wanted to keep playing!  So on to another. 99 game....
0385341008|5.0|The author used an intriguing method for storytelling -- the entire narrative is via post or telegram. An excellent juxtaposition of war-time romance, history, and literature.  While the story started with a large cast of characters, it eventually winnowed down to the essential protagonists and antagonists. Characters were eccentric but lovable. A fun, easy read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far oldy but goody type feel. many games to play and have fun. I would suggest it to anyone

B0042KZJ46|5.0|Yesss, a must have compact disk for any folks who love Brother Bob Marley's Spirit and Music.  His last reggae musical concert is a classic--he was still at his apex.  I was blessed to witness three Brother Bob Marley's concert: 1978--The Spectrum in Philadelphia, PA, 1978--Madison Square Garden in New York, NY and 1980--Civic Center in Philadelphia, PA.  Some of the best musical concerts I have experienced in 60 years of life.  At The Spectrum my nice/sweet/nice reggae girlfriend (Rhoda brought the tickets the day they went on sale) and I were standing up the whole concert in tenth row and I have been listening to Brother Bob Marley's music ever since, and hopefully his music will be played at my funeral--leave this planet singing and dancing in my wooden coffin--(: Smile :).  Okay, time go and taking off shoes and socks, sit on front row in lazyboy chair, light my Peace Pipe filled with so Primo Elevating and Medicinal Kayaherbbuds, and play---Bob Marley and Wailer LIVE FOREVER!  One Love!

IT HAD SO MANY MORALS TO THE STORY, A GREAT LEARINING EXPERIENCE FOR KIDS.  I DON'T BELIEVE STEVEN SPEILBERG HAS MADE A BAD MOVIE.  I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE, THANKS

0062082353|1.0|Are we seriously a part of a nation, a part of a culture, a part of an America, that is now bragging about how many human beings have been killed? Forget the argument of whether the violence is justified or not, and attempt to remember an honorable warrior or soldier of an earlier age, who took no pleasure in killing others, but saw it as duty, and hoped for a better age and a better time, and went back to his family, his community, his country, with he, and them, knowing he'd been asked to do terrible things, but would never boast of it, celebrate the bloodlust, or least of all, put it on the cover of a book and make the bloodlust chant a part of the marketing. This is a disgusting pandering to soulless people who revel only in hatred and animosity for others. This is the worst of our nation, and I'd garner to say, the stuff of Aztecs of the Romans, but in most ways, its worse, because as a nation, we should be a better people than this, with better \\"heroes\\" than this. And consider for a moment, that this thug author, and his co-horts, will be training police forces in the USA to deal with Americans as we are. Consider that readers. If he is so willing to say he has the 255 marks on his gun, notches on his belt for the quote unquote, \\"enemies of America,\\" consider how this thug will be measuring you and yours under the NDAA laws. He and his gang (essentially what they will be with no rule of law for civil liberties), will have the option, the choice, the \\"right,\\" to tag, bag, and potentially kill you and your family, just for expressing an opinion that you believe is just. I won't say burn this book, but show it to your children, discuss it with those in your church, your club, your meeting halls, your friends, and remind them that thuggery is fast becoming the American way, and men like this, its poster boys. Instill something in them better.
B005OK722U|1.0|I wasn't expecting something like the first 2 movies, since Eli Roth had nothing to do with it, and it was direct to dvd...but, wow..this just wasn't even close.   It actually has a good opening scene. Kind of giving you the tense feeling the other 2 did. A nice twist to start things out, so I was hopeful. But, way downhill after that. Characters and the actors who play them are awful.   But, even good characters probably wouldn't change it.   The beauty of the first 2 movies are lost here, when the locale is changed to Vegas. \\"Hostel\\" and \\"Hostel II\\" have our victims in a small country, where the police are in cahoots with the people behind Elite Hunting. I get the feeling that this can actually go on, and go on for a long time. I don't think it is too much of a stretch to imagine that it would be hard to track down info on missing backpackers. But, I do find it hard to imagine that a it could go on in a city like Vegas. Cameras everywhere, lots of high rollers, and it isn't exactly like they were doing this in a super secret place. I mean..the first 2 people disappear after a night of partying at this \\"club\\". So, to keep the \\"club\\" secret...they let 4 of the group go home? If my friend goes missing in Vegas, and I can't get ahold of him..I will probably be calling the police, and directing them to the last place I remember being at. Boom..game over.  Anyhoo..I digress. The rest of the movie is filled with nonsense where they try to link gambling to the torture. And then a twist about 3/4 of the way through, that is poorly done. And another twist at the end...that can be seen coming from a mile away, and as unbelievable as the concept that a club like that, could be be run by a dude that looks like he is probably 22.   I wasn't expecting much...and I got even worse!
B004XJHBCE|1.0|Puts all your apps into one big box with no options to chose which our in which order. Imagine a box with 50 utility and game apps in a chaotic mess. The developer has a lot of nerve charging for an app in its beta stage.

0393325172|5.0|My knowledge of Napoleonic-Era sea battles is lacking, but this book is written with such precision and enthusiasm that it feels alive. O'Brian admits in his introduction that he has changed a few things from history in order to make a better story; I couldn't tell you what they are, but let me say, this guy really knows what he is doing.<br /><br />I first fell in love with this story through the excellent movie of the same name (ProTip: listen to the movie soundtrack as you read this book), and while the book is decidedly different, it's an even more robust world to immerse yourself in. Many bits are omitted or condensed in order to make a tidy movie, for example: the H.M.S. Surprise which Jack captains in the movie, isn't in this book at all - in fact, Jack doesn't even have a ship at the beginning of the novel, nor is he exactly friendly with Stephen. It seems to me that a story this huge might be better suited to a series than a single movie. But whatever! These stories are great and I plan on devouring them in whatever form I find them.<br /><br />I'll probably never be able to grasp all the naval jargon being thrown around, but don't let that stop you. Not since reading \\"Shogun\\" have I been this transported into a historical setting. It doesn't hurt that the relationship between Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin delights at every turn. I smiled many times during their exchanges.<br /><br />There's a reason why Patrick O'Brian is considered a master of historical fiction, and once you get sucked into it, you won't want to leave either.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even though this book is categorized as a young adult novel, I immediately found it compelling as I worked my way through the first chapter. I recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh series to read that is entertaining, engaging, and addictive. I've moved on to the final book in the series and I'm very much looking forward to the film being made.
0060873027|5.0|This is the second \\"last\\" book by Michael Crichton, his first was \\"Pirate Latitudes\\" published in 2009. This novel was finished by Richard Preston after Crichton's death in 2008. The addition of a new author made me wary, but I had no reason to be trepidatious. This feels like classic Michael Crichton. High-tech science is misused, lives are endangered, page-turning excitement ensues.<br /><br />I love Michael Crichton's style - I can devour his books like no other, this is no exception. Not sure how much of this is Preston's work - it blends seamlessly with Crichton's. Astounding really. I plan on checking out more books by Richard Preston in the future.<br /><br />If you're looking for an entry point, this is as fine a place to start as any; although my favorites are still: \\"The Andromeda Strain\\", \\"Airframe\\", \\"Timeline\\", and of course both \\"Jurassic Park\\" books. Fans of Michael Crichton know what to expect and should jump right in, don't bother reading the synopsis on the dust jacket, it gets a little too close to giving away plot points.<br /><br />This book would make a fine movie (also: expensive) and the ending certainly makes me hope for more. Perhaps Preston can pick up the mantle? I don't know how many more half-finished stories or ideas Michael Crichton has left behind, but if this really is the last, it's worthy of his name.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|The game was fun until it shut down for no reason.  I think that anyone that paid money for this app. should get there money back.  it does not work properly.
B00004Y6NM|5.0|Eric Clapton / Behind The Sun:  This excellently performed and excellently produced album was a welcome arrival in 1985 and it remain an enjoyable listen.  The production here, far from being a drawback, lifts these songs and makes them soar.  This is a great album and it deserves Five Stars.
B000055Y0X|5.0|Dr. Strangelove is on of my all time favorite comedies.  It's a great film because it really shows the range that director Stanley Kubrick and actor Peter Sellers have.  Kubrick is a very, very talented director, and the film definitely shows that.  The total blackness of the humor is perfect.  It captures the bleakness of nuclear war, the hypocrisy of military, and really gives a brilliant satire of the cold war.  All of the small jokes that you catch the second or third time through such as the airforce base using the slogan \\"peace is our profession\\" or the miniature combination bible and Russian phrase book.  It also shows just how damn funny Peter Sellers is, doing three completely different roles and playing each of them perfectly.  It is a very funny movie, and the satire of the Cold War is done so well, it's easy to forget that they are talking about 20 million dead civilians.  Tops.
B0013LPS8E|5.0|U2 / War:  This has the big hit \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", but this is a complete and masterful album.  The theme of standing up for the little guy is heard throughout and its music is perfect for its `heroic' theme.  This is a Five Star album.
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I must say again, \\"WOW!\\"    Ordering this set a couple weeks before Christmas I was in for waiting until AFTER the holiday to receive The Doctor.    Happily I was wrong!   I received this package in super condition, original packaging and in under 5 days!  What a pleasant surprise!    Thank-you! Thank-you! Thank-you!
B000AMUU94|5.0|David Bowie / The Platinum Collection (3 CD set):  Yes, these are the radio edits of the songs (i.e. the familiar hits) and not the album cuts.  This is a fantastic set for the casual fan who wants a compact history of Bowie's music.  This also fits the needs of those who have the albums of a particular period, but wants the hits from the other periods as well.  This is a very well done set of Bowie's best.  Five Stars.
B004XCUEXY|5.0|Congratulations to the band, this is a perfect documantary, for the band fans or anyone else. Fully recomended!!!!!  The full history of the band is perfectly showed in the grat video,
B000002KYR|5.0|Z Z Top / Eliminator:  This is phase two for the band.  Gone is the bar band feel, and in comes the slick production.  This is not entirely bad news.  While the old band may be missed, this new sound is pretty damn good.  In fact, Z Z Top in the 1980's was one of the joys of the decade.  This is no trick album, this is solid rock N roll and it deserves all the attention it received.  This is a Five Star album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun app easy to earn free points love that option and the mini games aare a lot of fun to
B00001ZULV|4.0|Genesis / Turn It On Again / The Hits:  As most of the radio hits came along during the time when Phil Collins was leading Genesis, this is the perfect CD for those of us who have all the great Peter Gabriel Genesis albums and want a collection of these later hits.  For that purpose, this CD is perfect.  As a general Genesis hits CD however, it gets Four Stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is awesome and very fun you need it well as I said before it is awesome very very fun cool you need it
B000021Y7X|5.0|The Talking Heads / Stop Making Sense (concert DVD):  This DVD has a great line-up of their finest songs but it is much more entertaining than just a simple concert.  The beginning starts with Byrne and a tape recorder, from there a few more musicians are added with each song until the stage is filled with music and activity.  This starts slow and builds and builds and continues in a frenzy.  If you love the Talking Heads you will love this movie.  If you need a good long workout video, this is the one to get.  Five Stars.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is a fun game on the go or if u got nouthing to do f f g t r e w
B00000D9TQ|4.0|Phil Collins / Hits:  As a single disc collection of Phil Collin's hits, this is just fine.  However, the short nature of this CD limits the appreciation that the artist deserves.  Mr. Collins deserves a better anthology.<br />This one is good but I don't love it...Four Stars

B000002L80|4.0|Talking Heads / Little Creature:  This album came out after the great \\"Stop Making Sense\\" Movie was made and, having the DVD, I really didn't feel I needed any of the albums except this one, which has some great tracks.  This is a good album that is very entertaining.  Four Stars.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can now look at my sales for the day without leaving my house or better yet without my employees knowledge . I will be purchasing the full soon soon , so I can use my home computer as well.  Thank you for creating a good android app that fits in your hands.
B001041JLE|5.0|Michael Jackson / Thriller 25 (CD & DVD videos):  You ought to be familiar with the original album already so I won't describe it.  You probably already have your opinions about the person, but this is about the music (so I'll skip adding to the gossip of the dead).  This 25 edition has the album, has some nice bonus tracks and has the DVD with the videos of `Billie Jean', `Beat it' and `Thriller', along with the famous clip from the \\"Motown 25\\" broadcast.  So if you looking to buy this album for the first time on CD, this is a very good choice.  The album is a classic by any terms so I give it Five Stars.  This 25 version adds to the enjoyment.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I really like love this app. Very detailed monotone photo of the moon, countdown to next phase, from previous phase, tells you where in the phase you are now. Loaded perfectly.  Has a nifty calendar that lets you look ahead - great for fishermen! Would highly recommend!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Live Aid / July 13th 1985 (4 DVD set):  This does not have the Whole concert but this is the best version of it that is available.  This is more than just a concert, it is an event, and it is an event that is well remembered through this DVD set.  Buying this set reminds you of what an amazing event this was, and a portion of the money spent on this set continues to feed the hungry, so stick a crowbar in your wallet and help out a little while you entertain yourself.  Five Stars.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun...annoying at times. but I like it. have to get too many points to download games some are too hard.
B0000025VU|4.0|Bob Dylan / Infidels:  Dylan turns his attention from the Saved to the Infidels.  This album is filled with songs about the liars, the killers, the lonely and the lost.  It is surprising that so many critics of this album apparently failed to read, or understand, the title of this album.  This is a good album, not a great one, but it is still an album worth hearing and owning.  Four Stars
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i think it pretty cool to have the Bible everywhere you go without having to tote around a big book i am looking forward to exploring the Bible in a new way
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Pink Floyd's The Wall (movie):  For the fan of Pink Floyd, this movie becomes an instant favorite.  For the person not familiar with the music, this puzzling movie needs to be seen several times just to get a grip on it (if you don't toss it after the first viewing).  Trying to be objective, It's a brilliant collection of images set to the music of Pink Floyd that needs to be deciphered, and not everybody will be willing to go to all that trouble, but for those who do, it is a piece of brilliantly conceived, though depressing, art.<br /><br />Personal tale:  I saw The Wall in Westwood (California) on opening night (in 1982) with a then film student from UCLA (who is now a popular children's author) and his wife.  While we were in line, the previous group of moviegoers exited the theatre quietly and wobbly.  We looked at each other puzzled.  \\"Was the movie that bad?\\"  We soon entered with the next crowd and found a good set of seats.  My friend turned to the crowd and yelled, \\"Who let all this riffraff into the room?\\"  To which we received various reactions, but everyone was in high spirits in anticipation of the Pink Floyd movie.  As you may know, the movie starts off quietly.  It was not quite in that theatre however, as they had their massive speakers turned ALL THE WAY UP!  Once the first loud cord was struck, I was happy that I had sat down in time because the force of the blast was pinning me to the back of my chair.  I remained in that position for the rest of the movie.  The movie was amazing but the Westwood theatre speakers turned it into an audio, physical, and emotional assault.  Now I knew why the previous crowd was subdued...they were in shock.  We went down the block afterwards to a bar my friend knew of and we went upstairs and sat at a table.  To our surprise, there sat Alice Cooper (whatever his real name is).  He was in a corner, out of the view of the main body of bar goers downstairs.  Poor Alice must have been to the same screening we had attended because he looked as shell-shocked as we felt.  We acknowledged each other's presence politely, finished our drinks, and went home.  We had intended to discuss the movie, but had to allow for a couple of days of recuperation before doing so.  Overall, it was a memorable event.  We all liked the movie, amazingly enough, but decided that we would NEVER purposely listen to anything that came anywhere near that volume again!se he looked as shell-shocked as we felt.

B00637TV1I|5.0|Opening track 'Prisoner' is simply amazing & is a continuation from their initial 3 five track vinyl & CD EPs but with a slight transformation taking us more into an explosive thundering Kraftwerk/Pink Floyd/Future Sound Of London/Coldplay type territory even if it is not really like any of those. You should play this opening track a few times before you proceed any further as it's quite mesmerising. A berserk drummer (what a drummer) & a crazed female singer plus a female keyboardist (the brilliant Heather) who has also now gone bonkers & a still seemingly in control guitarist is buried within all of this as he introduces the build up with those ringing Floydish chords. It is a simply astonishing start. Maybe you don't need to go any further & just put this on endless re-play. Next 'Endless Summer' is more of this explosive kind & carries on some of the traditions of Aussie bands of the 80s like Choir Boys/Triffids. The songs have no choruses as this seemingly unusual story of inspired intense love unfolds with often Hayley singing about a \\"her\\" or a \\"she\\" hence some mystery \\"I've been on fire to go inside her\\" & \\"even in the way she walks\\" as whether she is singing from a male point of view or female or whether it is her love for the Aussie landscape of which unusual images are scattered in the CD booklet or all 3? 'Long Highway' as Hayley's Cyndi Lauper type supercharged vocals from this fragile looking female \\"hear me roar\\" is 100% emotion. Also brilliant, 'Try Colour' continues this huge sound with thundering drums & synthesizers - could such gentle looking people create such a huge tough sound. In fact the album is just like one long track & the remaining numbers are 'Rosebud', 'City Girl', 'Nobody Nowhere', 'Austerlitz' (a reflective instrumental which seems like an album closure before exploding again into further high energy), 'Deep Wide Ocean', 'Peace Of Mind', 'Reprise', and then grand finale 'Catch Me' \\"and in the towns that I love love love love\\" is another slab of total brilliance. Perhaps some things slightly missing are a really killer melody plus it's also slightly one dimensional & also not an easy work to get into but nevertheless the production, outstanding performance & interesting lyrics carries this beautiful & astonishing work into the stratospheres. Forget the media's yearly top album awards for 2011 this was or is the best.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I was very please with this seller. They were very quick in getting the item I order to me and it came undamaged and new just as they had described.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is very fun to have 101 games in one app.it is also fun because the  games are fun and cool
B004O3YGMC|5.0|It was easy to set up so I was also able to impress my husband with my \\"expert\\" ability. And it works great. It does far more than I expected. Nice going!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got the Kindle Touch as a Christmas present. I spent some time looking at the various covers Amazon offered and selected the Verso Prologue in Tan. I'm thrilled with my choice. The cover has a great feel to it, it's a quality product. I love the cover design as well. A classic looking tan book with gold inlay. The Kindle Touch fits perfectly inside and doesn't slide around. I highly recommend this cover.
B004VFYPTW|5.0|A must have video for all Whitesnake fans.  Excellent video and sound quality.  Worth every penny and more.  I have many recordings and video's of whitesnake, this is pure professional ..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are easy and fun, and its fun to have to pass them and go on to more games, plus they're very generous with points ;)
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've tried many different applications that claimed to access all files on my computer, but this app is much simpler to use. The sound issues on XP are a little frustrating, but a quick search in the support forums and I found a easy solution.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game!!! it is really awesome and cool and fun! it has really fun and cool games to play
0765324857|5.0|I bought this book in the hope of widening my Rapture experience and it has, indeed, fullfilled my expectations. This books brings an extremely fine work of literature to help all Bioshock fans immerse even more into the world of Andrew Ryan. It exceptionally describes and narrates what happened before Rapture was built and opens an even more tempting door: an obliged reading of Ayn Rand's \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" the masterpiece which inspired Ken Levine to come up with the Bioshock story. Ayn Rand's russian-american influence can be read between every line of this superb story in the north atlantic.   Four thumbs up (even with toes) for this book. Exceptional.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Just received my Kindle Fire. I'm kicking myself that I didn't see that no USB hookups were included. So there is a delay to use it. I'll update more when I can see all the functions.
B00005JY1O|5.0|One of the three essential albuns of Dylan! I have enjoyed the Mono experience. After this, the pop music world never been the same.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I am a fan,but even those are not, going to like this album. Very good would recommend to fans of rock.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app to listen to when going to bed or just chillin after work  its a must have
B00006F83Y|5.0|I am a fan,but even those are not, going to like this album. Very good would recommend to fans of rock.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Best book in the series! It's full of excitement and surprise. I recommend it to mostly teens who like romance and adventure, you won't be let down by this book!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I had very, very, very low expectations for this movie.  And it defintiely helped!  It was actually a really entertaining and fun movie!  I really thought it was going to be terrible and dumb, and don't get me wrong - parts of it were pretty stupid BUT - the movie is called \\"Cowboys and Aliens\\", so really what do you expect?  I actually really liked the story and action and effects.  I thought it was all done really nicely.  Just check your brain at the door and give it a shot.  Daniel Craig is awesome in this, but that goes for all his films, doesn't it?  This is the ultimate guy-movie, and so I heartily recommend it as I am a guy!
159514188X|1.0|I had to drag myself to finish this book, to me it lacks excitement. Wouldn't recommend it to people who seek exciting books and a good read.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I wasn't too sure that I could actually get this to do what I wanted.  I am pretty good at technology, but not a whiz.  My mother passed away last year and she had recorded her life story on a cassette about a year earlier.  I wanted to make copies of it for my children, but knew that I needed to put it on CD.  It took me a while to figure out how to download it into itunes and then put it on the CD, but the quality was great.  For not much money, I was able to accomplish what I wanted and without too much difficulty.  Very pleased with my purchase.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. It plays just as naturally as the old PC standby and doesn't eat as much battery as others I've tried. A++
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Fun while it works. Often freezes during gameplay. Also will hang in the event that your screen times out and you have to go to Setting->Apps and Force Stop the game. Often the music will continue playing even if everything else is frozen.<br /><br />Definitely seems like some updates are in order. This game is popular enough to warrant the continued development and bug fixes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is one of the more fun time wasting games that they sell on this appstore. I like it because if I have nothing else to do and I am always playing this game.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Terrible problems with force close. Took the time to do a manual close through the OS Manage Apps menu, and also cleared all personal data. Troubles continued. Only app I've ever used that had such constant failures. All events occurred while scrolling - slowly - through customer reviews and within the first couple minutes of use after closing and clearing. Because I was trying to place an urgent order while mobile I persisted, not believing an Amazon app could perform this poorly. I gave up at the magic number of ten crashes in twenty minutes, and did not place an order.   Toshiba Thrive Honeycomb 3.2.1.
B002ZG983M|5.0|My daughter and I went to see this when it first came to the theatre. It was funny but not really my style of comedy. I give it 5 stars because SHE absolutely loves it!
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|only problem for me is font is small i cant even see it with a magnifying glass but it might be my tablet
B004GYY714|5.0|this app is the best music app ever. I mean Pandora and iheart radio cant even compare. it an epic app. Kuhn yea
B00479SVBU|4.0|If you have to settle with a car stereo that doesn't have direct USB, AUX or Blue Tooth, this is the next best thing!  I've tried a couple of these things and this is by far the best sound quality I have found.  Not CD quality but almost as good as FM radio.  So if you are not a sound quality buff, this is a great player.  If you are a car stereo enthusiast, you are not going to like this and should spend the money and get a new head unit.  The best sound quality comes from the AUX jack as others have said so an MP3 player or I Phone through the AUX jack gives you the best sound.  I used this with a 4mgb USB stick and it works fine but again, the aux is the best for sound.  Hands free calling is also a great feature for your Blue Tooth capable phones.  Sound quality is excellent for this.  Being able to select any frequency available on the FM band is also a great feature.  CONS  1. Button navigation on this thing is horrible when trying to navigate through song folders.  2. If you have a station you like that is anywhere near the frequency you select for the player, it will be turned into static as the player is so strong that it takes up quite a wide frequency range. (Pro for this is you will never hear static through the player!).  To remedy this, you have to unplug the player from the cigarette lighter or power outlet.  The nice thing is that it remembers where you left off when you plug it back in.  3.  The remote SUCKS!  Don't even bother to un-wrap the batteries for it.  I have to hold it about an inch away to get it to work!
B004V5QWU2|5.0|this works I fell asleep so fast I could not beleave it gosh this app really works it tricked me in to thinking I was camping

B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun free app. ads are annoying,  but its free so they need to make money somehow. games are pretty much hit or miss. you should try it, its free!

B004O3YGMC|2.0|I had purchased this app a few weeks prior to it becoming the FAotD, and I had absolutely loved it for my Kindle.  However, the day it became free there was an update to download, and since then I've had two major issues. The first is the horrible lag that I experience from both my Pc and laptop. My Internet hasn't changed, and there was no issue with a delay in responsiveness before this update.  I like to stream video to my Kindle from my Pc so I don't have to use up the small hard drive on my device, but now it's completely unusable. It takes 30 seconds just to click on something! The second issue is unreliability in recognizing available pc's. I used to be able to circumvent this with the Google account option, but now it's pretty random when it decides to find either of my computers regardless of how I try to connect. I'm going to try and find a different app to use for this purpose from now on.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Super Fun little app on the kindle fire. Very cute and addicting. Totally worth the dollar I paid for it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app works great.  I play spider all the time.  Hints and undo available when you're in a Pickle. If you like to think, it's for you.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is a lot of fun. a great pass time, if you are not doing anything, or waiting for the public transit
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its good.. you should try it for yourself and see..you also get bonus points for rating the game. that is why I wrote this review
0545265355|5.0|First let me start off by saying that I'm not much on reading.  That being said, I saw the preview for the movie and thought to myself \\"I have got to read the book before the movie comes out!\\"  So the tough decision was do I buy just the Hunger Games book or do I buy the trilogy?  I decided on the trilogy and WOW!  I'm sure the next two books will be just as thrilling as the first one.  I am completely engulfed in this book! And when I am finished, my mom and my best friend want to read the books too!  You will absolutely love them!
B004LWZWBU|4.0|The hubby and I watched The Big Year last night.  With a cast that includes Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson, who can resist?  It was a decent movie and definitely worth seeing at least once.  The acting was great and the plot was well thought out.  It wasn't quite as funny as I was hoping for but there were some moments that I couldn't help but chuckle.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this movie for free for review purposes.  All opinions are 100% my own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I liiiiiiiike it. great app. I like games. ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Rarely does the last book in a trilogy live up to the previous books but Mockingjay does.  There were enough twists and turns in the final book to keep me turning the pages and anticipating the next move by Mockingjay.<br /><br />I appreciate the author not making the characters one dimensional good guys or bad guys.  She left room for the characters to be human and not always sympathetic and likable.<br /><br />While I thoroughly enjoyed the book and even felt it ended as it only could I felt a bit depressed because it hit too close to the truth.  We, as humans, will always be disappointed with other humans because humans are so imperfect and the lust for power and money more important than human kindness and honesty. The lesson imparted from Mockingjay is we do what we can to make things better and then having done what we can we just get on with living our life.<br /><br />I believe this book will haunt me for awhile but I can't ask more of a book than to entertain and make me think.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome,  I use this quite frequently.  Enjoy the vast resources, offline accessibilty, and User friendliness. One negayive: runs in background persistently.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Good movie about serious issues in this country. This would never happen if people were more kind to one another, instead of trying to act like their better & taking advantage of people who serve them. They should be grateful. How would they like it if positions were reversed & they had to serve. You'd really see thier hatred then!!!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Looks better in person!! My husband loves books and loves his cover that resembles a paperback.  Definately worth the $$
B005XN0SGU|4.0|I haven't used any of the other apps for reading comics, but this one works well. You can buy digital versions from any online store and easily transfer them to your documents and read them easily. Unlike the other apps, you aren't restricted to just one store.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|This review may include some spoilers....  Maybe I just needed a good laugh, or maybe I just accepted Hangover II for what it was... entertainment. I wasn't expecting any Oscar performances; I simply wanted mindless, stomach splitting humor which is what I got. The Hangover II proved for several hours of good fun. I personally thought this one was just as funny as the first. I mean what could be more hilarious as Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow and Mike Tyson singing. Anyway, Stu is planning on marrying Lauren (the love of his life). Initially he invites all of his friends, with the exception of Alan, to come join him in Thailand for the upcoming nuptials. But succumbing to pressure from Phil and Doug, Stu finally invites Alan to join them, which would prove to be the first in a series of steps that lead to quite the adventure.   Once they arrive in Thailand, Stu has to deal with Lauren's father (who hates him and takes every opportunity to demean his future son-in-law); Alan's jealousy of Lauren's kid brother Teddy (a genius and Stanford Med Student); and Phil's attempts to plan a bachelor party. After all he remembers Las Vegas and doesn't want anything like that to happen again. As luck would have it, Phil, Stu and Alan wake up in Bangkok with (again) no memory of the events from the night before. The only things they know for sure is that (1) Stu now has a large tattoo on his face (that strongly resembles the one Mike Tyson sports); (2) they now are responsible for a monkey (who smokes and does other hilarious things); (3) Teddy, Lauren's little brother is now missing and all they have left of him is a finger with his class ring; (4) they are a long way from where they should be and must get Stu and Teddy back in time for the wedding; (5) Alan is bald; (6) Mr. Chow is still involved in some questionable things; (6) there is a monk, who has taken a vow of silence who witnessed the events from the previous night; and (7) they are in a great deal of trouble. It would seem that the Las Vegas events are tame compared to what they are don't remember experiencing in Bangok.   I honestly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to those looking for some mindless humor.

B004LWZWBU|5.0|I love birds, and thanks to my mom, my family has no less than a half dozen pairs of binoculars and bird books; we subscribe to Birds &Blooms, Wild Bird, etc. I saw a grand total of two previews for this movie, and got the book from the library after the first. It was a great book. The movie was better: a few details changed for a perfect ending, almost as many shots of the birds as the cast, who were wonderful in this film. My children enjoyed it, and I can hardly wait for my husband to see it. Had it stayed in theaters long enough, I would have gone to see it on a weekly basis. It is sad that there was so little buzz about this movie, because it was absolutely perfect in every way! The whole family can watch together, unlike so many movies released these days, and it is the perfect encouragement for backyard birders.

0385535139|1.0|Grisham's \\"Litigators\\" is simply not Kindle ready.  Too many errors in proofing, and terrible word wrap.  None of the Kindle settings will allow you to read the book in Portrait layout which makes the Kindle version virtually unreadable.  Clancy's usual strong character development is missing, and the syntax does not read like Grisham at all.  I smell a ghost-writer at work or a very hurried book.  If I could, I'd ask for a refund.

B005WM6RUS|5.0|Notice for avid readers:<br /><br />Sarah's Key will keep you on the edge of your seat, break your heart and have you rooting for Sarah all at once.<br />This poignant story of the Vel'd Hiv round-up of Jewish families in occupied France (July 16-17, 1942) will open every reader's eyes to the cruelty of the Nazi regime and the ignorance and indiffernce of the French police. Told through the eyes of 10 -year old Sarah, you will identify with her strength and determination not only to survive but to keep her promise to her little brother Michael.<br />A real page turner.  Whether you are history enthusiast, an avid reader or just interested in finding out what became of 10 year old Sarah, I highly recommend this book.

1401322336|4.0|I love Jamie Oliver. I love cooking. And yet, this is his first cookbook that I've purchased. I'm not going to lie: when I began thumbing through this cookbook and looking at the recipes, I was initially disheartened. Some recipes seemed difficult, and some of the ingredients were hard to find at your garden-variety bevy of grocery chains. *However*, I am pleased to report that the few recipes I've tried thus far have been beyond my expectations. I am constantly discovering that I actually *can* cook with advanced techniques/ingredients and not ruin my dish. The cookbook itself is beautiful; a nice matte cover, and tons of glossy food pictures! (I absolutely do not like to cook recipes 'sight unseen'). Jamie provides a background for each dish, and his instructions are delightfully British (a few colloquialisms here and there) and easy to understand. Many of the recipes are simple, yet maintain a professional/foodie flare. Jamie's refreshing enthusiasm for the home cook is evident on every page. The added bonus? All proceeds from the sale of this cookbook go to his charity, the Fifteen Foundation.
0439023521|1.0|I read the both The Hunger Games and Catching Fire a couple years back, before Mockingjay had come out and long before this  (undeserved) hype had started. I've always been an avid reader, so when I stumbled upon it at the library and it looked interesting, of course I took it home. Like anyone, I found the story fast-paced and compellingly told, but I didn't like much else about it. After I finished the two, they quickly left my mind, making no impression on me.   I only just got around to reading Mockingjay last week (I can't stand not to finish a series once I start), amidst the inexplicable amount of excitement about the series and the upcoming movie. Upon finishing it I made the decision, once again, that the Hunger Games is not a good series.  I have rarely encountered a character I dislike as much as I dislike Katniss. A comparison that comes to mind is Harry Potter's Professor Umbridge--and even then it's a different situation, because you aren't expected to root for Umbridge, while Katniss is the main character and the narrator of this trilogy. Katniss is cold, selfish, entirely self-serving, oblivious to the kindness of others, brash, vengeful, and truly cares about no one. All this, and in all three books I failed to see any character growth. She badly mistreats her mother, Peeta, and Gale throughout the series (and yet, Peeta and Gale both follow her like puppy dogs--this makes absolutely no sense as she has no redeeming qualities) and, although several times realizes it, does nothing to rectify her actions. Sickening, truly. Perhaps the best example of Katniss' absolute lack of character is at the end of Mockingjay when she votes \\"yes\\" for a final Hunger Games. While Peeta vehemently disagrees with the notion, Katniss agrees thinking only of revenge. Way to have some growth, Katniss, it's really endearing of you. To me, Katniss is an empty shell of a person. She is hardly the only person in Panem to have suffered hardship, so she should probably grow upand deal with things as a functioning human would. But Katniss seems to have no soul and hardly any humanity at all--and this is the heroine leading us through this acclaimed trilogy.  It's true that the series is fast-paced, compelling, exciting. But if one takes a step back to examine, at least, the first two books, what is it? Nothing but a weak, bare-boned story about a girl surviving in some woods by killing others in devious ways. The story of the revolution is very thin indeed in comparison to the graphic details of kids killing each other in cold blood. In other words...boring, brutish, and barbarian, just Katniss displaying her lack of moral character as she clings to survival. Yawn. But more disturbing, these books offer no redemption, no message of hope. Just blackness. It's unsettling and disturbing...and even more disturbing that so many people are considering this series so wonderful.   Yes, I know--the books are deeply symbolic, meaningful, brilliant. But not to me. To me they are nothing but a waste of paper concerning one soulless, selfish, unlikable girl and a whole lot of death. This series will never be anything to me, and the current hype around it is ENTIRELY undeserved. As for me, I'll never waste a cent on any part of this franchise--books, movies, or anything else. Brilliant? Please. If you want to read a really brilliant story, try something with a little more redemption and humanity.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great app for when you're bored. its great to pass time by. me and my husband love to play it when we have nothing to do at home.
0446573019|4.0|David Baldacci writes a number of series, but this book introduces a new character: John Puller.  Puller is a specialist military policeman who grew up in a military family.  He has strong deductive powers, superior combat skills, a loner personality and drinks a lot of coffee.  Sounds familiar?  The story is highly reminiscent of Lee Child's books - but the good news is that it's better than the last few Reacher novels.  If I didn't think Child writes his own books, I would be wondering if Baldacci had poached Child's top ghost writer.  Certainly it's hard to believe that this book was written by the same person who penned the dire [[ASIN:B005SNNXYE True Blue]].<br /><br />The story involves Puller being sent to small town West Virginia to investigate the murder of a colonel and his family.  He quickly builds a strong rapport with the police sergeant Samantha Cole and they work together on the case.  As the body count grows, it swiftly becomes apparent that there is more to this than a simple family murder and that both Puller and Cole are in danger.  There are a lot of twists and the story holds your attention nicely.  None of it is very plausible, but that's pretty common for the genre.  If all you want is sheer entertainment, you will find it here.<br /><br />The only thing that really bugged me about this book was Sam's family - both her brother and sister play key roles and neither is even remotely believable.  Their conversations, motivations and actions are all simplistic and highly unlikely.  A shame, because several of the other characters are genuinely interesting and nuanced.  I found my heart sinking a little whenever the family came into the action.  But otherwise I was pleasantly surprised by this and I thought it was easily the best that \\"Baldacci\\" has written in a while.  If you enjoy Lee Child's books, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this also.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game was free, so I wasn't expecting too much, but it's pretty fun. the graphics aren't amazing, but it is interesting.
