0385504209|1.0|Take one handsome, brilliant, and embarassingly humble college professor who has achieved celebrity despite the obscurity of his chosen area of study; add one beautiful and equally brilliant female counterpart integral to the male's progression through the story; drop in one phyical freak of nature hell-bent on destroying . . . anything; mix well with a healthy disregard of character, dialogue, and scene;  stir with a plot that threatens the world or at least our perception of reality. A shakey grasp of what constitutes prose and an ulterior motive behind conveying the story is a must.<br />I have read a half-dozen books in the past few years that follow this recipe to the letter. It's an insult to completely ignore any attempt at originality. I might have been more forgiving, a summer blockbuster in book form, had it not been for the blatant stupidity of the main characters and of the story itself. As an example, the two main characters are scampering around the Louvre, searching for clues to a message that was left to them by the dying curator, who is also the woman's grandfather. Within a few pages, each figures out a clue that should have been obvious to both of them. Their opposite then says some variation of: \\"I should have seen that!\\" Infuriating.<br />To his credit, the author has created a page-turner. Unfortunately, after a hundred pages and thinner wallet, you won't care enough to finish it.
B000063COX|5.0|Ok, this album is a well done album. But I can't really judge this album to harshly because before I heard this album I had owned all of Bruce's stuff with maiden. And once you've had Bruce... you can never go back. But I tried to go back with killers and Iron Maiden. This album is decent. The highlight to me would be Running free, and Transylvania is one of my all time favorite instralmentals(nothing tops the call of Kutulu-Metallica), anyway this album is pretty good, worth buyin ir your a maiden fan, which I am. So have fun with it and as always. Up the Irons!
B000001F5A|4.0|A child of the sixties, I've always eschewed anything with a synthesizer. I mean, \\"microwave rock,\\" and all THAT...But I had a lady friend in the early nineties who turned me onto Brian Eno, Enya, & Kitaro - and this, and well: it's lovely music to relax, shake the ennui off, and (maybe) get frisky to. Thank goodness Van never joined Yes.
0684833395|4.0|The book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is not like any other book that I have read. Usually when I sit down to read a book and find it hard to stay with I give it up. This book is like that. In the first hundred pages you start off in an Italian Hospital and then you are out in the war and back in the hospital. This book does a lot of jumping around and is hard to get started. I found that after the hundred pages there is a lot of humor and it becomes an enjoyable book.<BR> Another reason to like this book is because of the main character Yossarian. He makes this book more enjoyable to read because of how humorous he is.  At the end of the book the army tells him that he is free to go if he talks good about what is happening, Since Yossarian doesn't believe in what is happening he runs off and frees himself. He does this because he knows that if others go to war they can die and he doesn't want that to happen. <BR> Catch 22 teaches the reader to watch out for higher-ranking people trying to pull a fast one by trapping them in a no win situation.
B000068OCS|5.0|Life out of Balance<br />As Western Civilisation tears a path across Earth, it leaves the debris of its construction scattered over the surface of the planet. America's `purple mountained majesty' and `spacious skies' have fallen to strip mines and heavily patrolled air space. Biological evolution has become irrelevant, replaced by the manipulation of our environment and genetic modification. We are rapidly constructing a civilisation of destruction. We have raped the earth of her beauty and replaced it with towers of corporate power and industrial wastelands. We have dehumanised ourselves, disconnected of earth itself we lose all identity as human creatures and are now but the interchangeable parts of a global machine.<br />It is the horror of what we have become that forms the core of Godfrey Reggio's Koyaanisqatsi. By juxtaposing the cool tranquillity of nature against the frantic rat race of man, Reggio demonstrates to us just how far we are removed from our origins. Unlike the desert calm or rolling clouds, we are the violent actions of Earth. Volcanoes, we erupt upon the surface, creating havoc and destroying all that lie in our path. Reggio prompts us to ask ourselves why we are what we have become.<br />Koyaanisqatsi, despite dating to 1983, is still highly relevant. It's timeless. It transcends the barriers of language, relying only upon images and music to transmit its message. The message is sometimes confused, hidden behind a façade of beauty, but it is in this façade that the message is found. The juxtaposition of nature's beauty against man's hideous creations is intended to reveal our true nature. Our awesome construction projects, the very indicator of our power, are ugly. The fabric of our society, the web we weave, is weak. Every inch we raise ourselves above what is considered base, is merely another inch for us to fall.<br />Reggio's film is a cinematic masterpiece. Each shot is beautifully composed, offering us new perception into the world wespend our every waking moment in. However, it is in the manipulation of the images that the message is created. By under and over cranking the camera, Reggio changes not only our visual perception but also our relationship with time. He is able to isolate people on the crowded streets of New York and Los Angeles, slowing the rush of a nine to five existence. The sense of worthlessness is overwhelming, these individuals are lost amongst the masses, one of millions who crowd the streets. Yet for a few brief seconds this individual is bought to a near halt, immortalised on celluloid. It demonstrates the very banality of modern human existence. Humanity strives for immortality is some form or another, but in our very quest we have wrought our own destruction.<br />Humanity's zenith has passed. In the final shot of the film, one which lasts several minutes, we watch a shuttle launch into space. Space exploration, man's greatest achievement, becomes a metaphor for its creator. As the craft rises above the earth it carries the hopes of a species. It is majestic, the pinnacle of technology, the culmination of 100 000 years of modern human existence. However, like man, the craft is doomed for failure. As the explosion tears the craft apart, so are the dreams of man strewn across the empty sky. The camera follows a piece of flaming debris as it falls to earth. This is our fate. As Lucifer fell from heaven, so must man fall from grace.<br />The film attempts to illustrate the flaws of man. In our success lies our failure. It does not advocate any cause or lifestyle, it merely informs us of who we are and what we will become of our future should we continue as we are.
B000002I6T|5.0|One of the many remarkable things about this album is that the first voice to be heard on it isn't even Crosby's- -it's Neil Young's.  There isn't anything here that would sound out of place on either the CSN debut or- -more especially- - DEJA VU, either.  True, it isn't as cohesive as the debut but it's better, and it is certainly stronger overall than DEJA VU or Crosby's own efforts on that album ('Almost Cut My Hair'? Sheesh.  'Deja Vu'?  C'mon).  It's an album of intentionally questionable identity, from the title through the various characters Crosby plays. It's a very weird album, by turns corny and grating ('Cowboy Movie' sounds like the jam that would turn into Young's 'Down By The River') and lovely and wistful ('Traction In The Rain' teeters beautifully on the Cliffs Of Despair).  Et 'Orleons' est dans sa classe propre.  Yeah, the album is flawfull.  Yeah, it's uneven.  Yeah, it has all the usual West Coast friends and suspects all over it.  Yeah, I love it.
1590866355|5.0|The essence that Mitch Album put into this book is so full of beauty that it is to hard to put completely together.  After reading the book,  I began to watch the movie.  As I saw him carrying his dance shoes(first scene), I began to cry.  Full of sorrow for a man who I had never met.  When a story can do this to you, there is nothing that will ever match up to the feelings and the jerking of tears, as will this.  However sad the book may be, when you have finished, you will feel like a new person, with a new outlook on life.  This is definatly, a book to have in everyone's private collection.
B00006690G|4.0|First off; Eminem's lyrics and tounge-twisting flow are at his top on the most of the album. BUT, the production isn't that good. In the years, Eminem has gone from being a classic lyricer on Infinite, to a funny guy on slim shady lp, to a contraversial figure on Marshall Mathers Lp, and now; he is arguably the best MC in the game. BUT, i rate all his albums between 3.5 to 4.0. Not more. Including Eminem Show. <BR>This is my review over the songs:<br />White America: Lyrics are good, beat is ok. 8/10<br />Business: Bouncing song but the lyrics are not that good. 7/10<br />Cleanin Out My Closet: Lyrics are good, beat is good. 9/10<br />Square Dance: This would be a great song, but Eminem manage to ruin its goodness by a awful rhyme in the third verse. Yaknowhatimtalkinabout!<br />Soldier: The beat starts off great,but in the end its BORING. Lyrics are ok. 6/10<br />Say Goodbye To Hollywood: The lyrics are good, beat is ok, Em's flow is good, but the chorus damage the hole song. Really bad and irritating chorus. 7/10<br />Drips: Funny lyrics, Em outshines Obie here. Rather uninteresting song with a bouncy beat. 6/10<br />Whitout Me: Funny lyrics ( funny video! ), fast flow, catchy beat but still WEAK! 6/10<br />Sing For The Moment: The lyrics are good, same about the beat. Not that nice sampled chorus, but still a good joint. 8/10<br />Superman: BAD beat, BAD chorus and Eminem is not at his best. 6/10<br />Hailey song: Eminem means good, but the song is nuthin but WACK. Totally wack beat, even more wack singing and WACK chorus. 2/10<br />When The Music Stops: The beat is typical D-12 stuff. Lyrics are good and the hole thing is good. 7/10<br />Say What U Say:<BR>The beat is good. Both Em & Dre's lyrics are great, but the delivery by Dre is not good. Eminem outshines the doc here! 8/10<br />Till I Collapse:<BR>Banging beat, tough lyrics and for once on this album a MAGNIFICENT hook by the hook king: Nate Dogg. Wonderful by Nate Dogg. I must give this a 10/10<br />My Dads Gone Crazy:<BR>Ok song. Not more. 6/10<br />EMINEM SHOW:<BR>The beats lack a little bit, but they set Eminems lyrics & flow in focus, which is good.

B00005JKPF|5.0|I went to this movie expecting 130 minutes of entertainment, and thats what I got. X-2 is certainly better than the first movie. Now, all main characters are already introduced to those people who watched the first one, but have not a close relation to the comics.<br />At first, I thought X-2 would focus mainly on Wolverine, but thats not true. Sure, in the moives Wolverine is still the most popular character, but hes not alone. Every major mutant character has the chance to be a good time on screen. Every one of them is given dimension, I could see they were well-developed for screen. Even so, X-2 is not, as may happen in other similar situations, a show-case for every hero to automaticaly and pointlessly display what he/she is capable of. Every mutants actions is made acording to a good script, and Brian Singers competent direction is able to give credibility to the movie (of course, credibility based on the premises of such a movie).<br />I said the scrip is good. There are no boring fight scenes every two minutes, I could find no major sequence-continuity mistakes, no rushed conclusions, and what is best, the story doesnt treat the viewer as an idiot. The only flaw I noticed is that the movie starts a little too fast, but that may be one more reason to keep the eyes on the screen. There are some funny moments too, mainly with Ian McKellen and his out-of-date uniform.<br />Speaking of Ian McKellen, pay attention to the casting: we dont see this reunion of stars every day. McKellen, Patrick Stewart (the perfect Xavier), Brian Cox (as the common enemy of the mutants, thats why the title X-Men united), Hugh Jackman, Allan Cumming (amazing as the dark, catholic-fervorous Nightcrawler), everyone of them exeperienced, competent actors. And the women: all of them beautiful and talented: Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen (her best role so far), Rebecca Romijn (remember to close your mouth in the scene where she is not wearing make-up).<br />Not to mention the great visual effects. X-2 was an expensive movie, but one that will easily pay-off.<br />First class entertainment, movie grade 9.2/10p). <br />Not to mention the great visual effects.

0156027321|5.0|The winner of the 2002 Man Booker Prize is an extraordinary book. A boy, with a name that sounds like an obscenity, is the sole (soul) survivor of a shipwreck - along with a hyena, a zebra, an orang-utan, and a Royal Bengal Tiger called Richard Parker.<br />  However, it takes about a hundred pages before Piscine Molitor Patel (he was named after a swimming pool), is cast adrift in the swells of the Pacific Ocean, after Mrs Gandhi has invaded his family's comfort zone and forced them to flee to Canada.  Before that happens, we learn a bit more about Pi's extraordinary childhood.  He's lucky in that he has a mother who reads widely, and Pi is allowed to dip into her library, with only the ruder bits of literature being censored.  In short, Pi would appear to be on a perpetual quest, always discovering new things.  In comparison with his brother Ravi, who is the captain of the local cricket team, Pi is a bit of a loner, but a series of serendipities ensure his survival.  The Patel family is secular, but Pi finds glory in religious practice(s).  An encounter on the esplanade with three wise men leads to the discovery that Pi is a devout Hindu, Christian, and Muslim.  As his brother Ravi observes, if Pi converted to the Jewish faith, then he would need only find three other religions to have a day of rest for every day of the week in perpetuity.  Along the way, he finds two Mr Kumars, one a devout Muslim, and the other a devout atheist science teacher.  Pi only reserves his scorn for Agnostics, the eternal doubters.  It would appear important that Pi has such an abundance of faith.  What else could get you through living with a ferocious tiger called Richard Parker on a small lifeboat?<br />  Mamaji says that Pi's story could make you believe in God.  There's no doubting the power of Yann Martel's novel, but I cannot say that it gets me to believe in God.  No, the importance of Life of Pi for me was the insistence on choosing a \\"better story\\".  I'm sure this, more than anything else, must have helped sway the Man Booker judges to plump for this book.  Even the Man Booker webpage accidentally plumped for this book when it erroneously announced Yann Martel as the winner the week before.  It's the way a story is told, true or not, that earns its immortality.  True, there are some improbable moments in Life of Pi, where our faith is tested, but Yann Martel is an excellent fisher of readers: we are on his hook, we may try to fight back with all our might, but in the end, all of us will have to admit that it is he who is in control throughout.<br />  At first sight, we seem to learn more about psychology rather than religious faith or God in this book.  We see very little of Pi being sustained by religious faith - we are told about it, but we do not see it actually feeding him, except maybe in that bizarre anti-Eden of algae.  No, this book seems more like an impassioned plea for the values of fiction itself.  As the author of Life of Pi himself writes, \\"If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams\\".  This sounds like a call to arms, and it's a call that I take up willingly (even if the narrator, like Holly in Rider Haggard's Gothic Romance She, would appear to be a fictional device, he does have an authentic tone).<br /><br />But if you do happen to dive beneath the surface, you will find that there are quite a few religious concepts alluded to in the course of this novel.  \\"Tsimtsum\\", for instance, is a term derived from Jewish mysticism, related to God's withdrawal or sinking from the universe... There are references to the various flood myths (like Zadie Smith's The Autograph Man, this novel delves in Jewish mysticism from the Kabbalistic Zohar branch). I believe that the concept of Tsimtsum also plays a major role in how Yann Martel has structured Life of Pi.  There is something very circular in telling Pi's story in exactly 100 chapters.  Also, when Pi uses pi to work out the circumference of that strange anti-Eden he lands on, you can't help but acknowledge that there is some great deal of thought in Yann Martel's naming of Pi, since pi is synonymous with circles.  When God creates his vacuum, one can only imagine a circular shaped hole.  Galaxies certainly resolve around black holes.  Markandeya is also mentioned - he, like Pi, was also 16 when he was saved by his faith. When Pi is on the phone ordering Pizza, he says that his name is 'I am who I am' (in the same manner that God answers Moses' question about his identity).<br />Yann Martel has set this novel in a series of real locations that add a great deal of authenticity to this far out tale.  I have created an in-depth web page that goes `behind the scenes' of the Life of Pi, explaining all the references.  Interested readers can contact me for details of this webpage - go armed to your readers group armed with all the facts!

0152023984|4.0|I very much agree with Eric Schaper from Mankato, whose review I just read, in saying that the original translation far surpasses the recent one.  I have loved The Little Prince since I first read the book as a child, and have reread it countless times.  There is a particular charm in the first translation that is missing in the 2000.  I find this translation to be a bit chopy in places and much less endearing.  I have been recommending this book for years and will continue to point my friends to the original.
B00005JKN9|5.0|I have never like Leonardo DiCaprio. To me, he has never been what I would call an actor. They certainly could have found someone better to play his part. But he did an alright job. I'll give him that.<br />2. Daniel Day Lewis stole the entire film. Now there is an actor. I walk away from all of his films feeling satisfied. I wish he would have won that oscard but Adrien Brody did do a good job in the pianist so I can't complain<br />I thought this film had a well rounded cast. I even thought that Cameron Diaz did a good job but that is also because I have had a big crush on her since Theres something about Mary. <br />Finally, Martin Scorcese. What else can I say about him? Aside from spielberg, he's the best director around and this film just comfirms it. <br />I would recommend that you be your own judge when you see this film, don't go by what other people are saying. That's why they invented chocolate ice cream. Because not everybody likes vanilla.

Michael Lewis gives all the facts on why the Oakland A's are so successful in baseball with ~$50M budget against teams spending 2-3 times as much. This book is not a glorification of the A's GM, Billy Beane but a complete dissection of the ways baseball teams must operate to compete successfully.  If I was a baseball owner, I would require my General Manager to read the book and explain why our payroll is so high with poor results (NY Mets, Baltimore Orioles).  Overall great book.<BR>JTS
B00003CXBH|5.0|I have consistently heard critics harping about the lack of a human element in this movie, the chatacters being hollow, less than absorbing.....<br />Well, to this \\"critic's\\" eye the Critics don't get it.<br />This film was an amazing accomplishment. It made you witness first hand the demise of a group of \\"primitives\\" at the hand of a holy sanctioned conqurer....ring any bells? <br />The beauty of The Mission is that it dispensed with much of the trite explanation of character in such PC black and white easily digested exposition. <br />This film brought you into a realm in a completely different manner. You were not the evil Spaniard or the helpless Native. You observed the struggle, almost voyeruisticly. The conclusions are drawn by seeing what transpires. Not by some easily digested, expositioned viewpoint.<br />That is what makes this movie affect you with such power. It is different, and for a good reason. You may crawl and yearn for A Color Purple, To Kill a Mocking Bird, and numerous other armchair activist classics. But instead you are handed the task in drawing your own conclusions in witnessing the transformation of the Natives culture. In other words.....it sticks with you!<br />So for the Critics that lambast this film, go for it! Ivory towers guarantee you sublime distance from art that asks you to do the work. Yes this film is art!
B00005JL78|3.0|Once again, Steven Spielberg has given us a very enjoyable, skillfully made science fiction film.  Tom Cruise plays a policeman in the \\"precrime\\" division, which uses the visions of \\"precognitives\\" to see murders that will be committed in the near future.  Because many murders are crimes of passion, the precrime cops often have little time in stopping the crimes, leading to a very exciting first act where we see Cruise and his stormtroopers in action.  Unfortunately, the next vision of the precogs shows Cruise murdering someone he's never heard of, and we're off on a vaguely Hitchcockian chase where Cruise attempts to figure out who his victim is and why he will kill him, while trying to avoid his former colleagues.<br />There are some great action set-pieces in the film, and they are obviously stuntmen/wire stunts, not CGI, which have a startlingly realistic look compared to most recent action films.  (Unfortunately, when CGI is later used, it looks all the more silly.)  All five of the lead characters are well-played.<br />And yet....  There are some plot inconsistencies (and not just the inevitable time paradoxes).  The CGI \\"spiders\\" that the precrime cops use to investigate a building are logically impossible (this is the problem with CGI - if you built a physical model, it would be obvious that a 3-legged creature with pin-point \\"feet\\" could not balance on two of these points and lift a floor vent without toppling over).  The explanation of the origin of the precogs is laughable (sort of like Spiderman's powers originating from a radioactive spider bite).  The whole precrime system MUST be a unconsitutional! (jailing people for crimes they haven't actually committed or even attempted)  These problems would be forgivable in Star Wars or A.I. because they don't try to be \\"realistic\\" in terms of foreseeable technology.  In hard science fiction, these errors are grating and detract from the enjoyment of the film - if you're going to use a leap of logic, for heaven's sake don't try to explain it, that makes it worse!  Having said that, for the most part, the future technology is quite realistic, especially the advertising system - the billboards do a retina scan and tailor the ad to the observer.  Very neat (and frightening!).<br />This brings us to the second, most serious problem of the film, and that's the cimematography.  The colour is pretty much bleached out to nothingness.  Everyone looks like a Borg from Star Trek - white faces, grey outfits, etc.  People claim it looks gritty - it absolutely does not!  Instead, everything looks cold and sterile, like the inside of an operating room.  It worked in Private Ryan, it certainly does not work here (as it didn't work in Gladiator).  Think about this film crossed with Blade Runner's visuals and you can imagine how much better Minority Report could have been.<br />Finally - the DVD edition.  There is little here that warrents a second disc.  Sure, there are lots of little extras, but many of them are not interesting or useful.  Too often they act like a trailer for the film, not an explanation of whatever the mini-doc is supposed to be about.  However, fans of the film will find a number of little gems in these extras, it's too bad they are often buried in the treacle.

0385504209|5.0|What a great book.  Add &quot;Brown&quot; to your reading list.  If you like Cussler, Reilly, and the like, you will love Brown's new book and rising protaganist star &quot;Robert Langdon&quot; in this story of ancient brotherhoods, symbology, and fast-paced action through Europe. As a result of this book we want to explore some new areas in Europe. His story has some interesting turns and twists, but you will also find yourself going to the encyclopedia or Google to see if what he is saying is true, and sometimes it is! Opus Dei, the Merovingians, The Last Supper, Secret Brotherhoods, and more.  He takes real facts and events and weaves a wonderful action adventure story of an unassuming Harvard professor who goes to Paris to meet the curator of the Louvre, only to find him murdered with all kinds of symbolic messages that he can read.  Once you start, you cannot put this one down.
B000003TAL|3.0|i mean, let's not joke: this record towers over the best records by most other bands.  \\"kissability\\", \\"teenage riot\\", and \\"hey joni\\" are some of the best songs sonic youth has ever written.  but their best record?  hardly.  in my sonic youth collection, only \\"experimental jet set, trash & no star\\" and \\"nyc ghosts & flowers\\" gets throw on less.  particularly in the context of hearing these songs live (both at the time and even now), the performances on this album are less than inspired and the production drains even more life out of 'em.  don't get me wrong: i love me some sonic youth - no question.  i just find it wild that \\"daydream nation\\" constantly get heralded as their masterpiece when most of the records surrounding it (\\"sister\\", \\"bad moon rising\\", \\"evol\\", and \\"dirty\\" in particular) all put it to shame.  great record - just not their best.
B000089A07|4.0|I've seen Manhunter several time before this movie was even concieved, and I never enjoyed it. It was bland, slow and much like Mann's other works (say Heat) it was a crime drama, not a thriller, not at all.<br />That said, having read the novel before seeing the film, I find Red Dragon to be more interesting, deeper, richer and truer to the novel (escpecially the ending, and all the little details and clues from Harris's novel that where left out of Mann's version.) Brian Cox, though a fine actor, always seemed a bit clumsy and absurd as Lector, his posture and facial expressions where never suited to the ultra-calm and always posture purfect Lector of Harris's books.<br />My only complaints here, Ed Norton is too young, Harvy Keitel is too been-there-done-that for their parts. Oh, and changing the Film to Video tape in the story looses something for the date and time the book took place in, I would have enjoyed this better if it would have looked like the era the book did.<br />Over all, a very good film, superior to Manhunter, and truer to the novel.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|This album is amazing. I first borrrowed it from a friend over 15 years ago, and finally bought the CD last week so that I could download it to my new iPod. I love listening to the instrumental tracks, with their varied rhythms and instrumentation. The tracks with vocals are beautiful as well, with feel-good singing and chord changes. A truly memorable album.
0783217048|5.0|What a hilarious movie. I was so impressed how three straight men like Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo were able to pull off playing the roles of three drag queens. The scenes in this movie are completely hilarious. There are also great supporting performances by Robin Williams, Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Michael Vartan and a special appearance by RuPaul. This movie is filled with hilarious lines, funny situations, some good music, amazing acting and some touching moments. I definitely recommend this movie. This film may not have won an Oscar or a Golden Globe but it has won my heart with it's endearing characters and that's enough for me. Too Wong Foo is what great drag movies are all about.
B00006YXEK|5.0|All the songs on this CD are very good, the melodies are impregnatingly sweet and George's guitar playing is supperb, unique.  I have this CD permanently in my player and every continuous play beckons for more, grows more.
B00008VGK0|5.0|You gotta get this!<br />Felix da housecat is a phenomenal dj/remixer and madonna gets his best work on AMERICAN LIFE...its truly the best remix I've ever heard..he is xtremely talented; no surprise why Madonna chose him to work on it.<br />I also Love Peter Rauofers remixes of AMERICAN LIFE..they are true club anthems..<br />Finally Missy Elliots remix is strong and her rap in the beginning is brilliant..I'm so glad to see Madonna expanding her growing list of talent to help make her already phenomenal music more accesible and widely recieved by different types music listeners. A+ for AL. Jeannie
B00005JKZV|5.0|The movie, not the book.<br />The book was good. All three books were good.<br />The movie was good, too, but not for the same reasons the books were good. That's because they're two different things.<br />Sorry, everyone, for the remedial class in the difference between book and movie, but it seemed necessary.<br />This was a really, really good movie. They did an excellent job of catching the character of Gollum who, along with Frodo and Sam, will be pivotal in the next movie. The actor's movements were excellent and the special effects team did a spectacular job of making his facial expressions match the actor.<br />The plot with Merry and Pippin was rather more watered down than I'd hoped it would be, but the Ents were there, and they were neat-looking, and they pummeled their way to Isengard with a ferocity that surprised me. It makes sense, and is very much like the book, but it was still shocking. One touch in the battle scene I particularly liked: the dam has just broken and orcs are floundering everywhere. One of the Ents is on fire and dives into the water, dousing itself. It's kind of down in the corner of the screen and hard to see, but it's a nice touch of realism in a fantasy movie.<br />The Aragorn/Legolas/Gimli trek probably breaks most from the books, but it still had that \\"battle at the edge of desperation\\" feel to it, coupled with some good humour and scenes that leave you at the edge of your seat.<br />I eagerly await the conclusion to this remarkable trilogy of movies.
B00003OSTN|5.0|&quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; is a credit to Joan Crawford's talent and a definite must see!  Joan was awarded an Oscar in 1945 for her portrayal of Mildred Pierce, a woman consumed with making her daughters happy, no matter the cost.    Michael Curtiz demonstrates &quot;Casablanca&quot; was not his last masterpiece, doing an outstanding job directing this Warner Brothers film.<br />Mildred Pierce is determined to make the lives of her daughters, Veda and Kay, everything her own was not, refusing to let anything or anyone stand in her way.  Veda Pierce (Ann Blyth) is a spoiled, self absorbed teen who is never satisfied.  Kay Pierce (Jo Ann Marlowe) is the sweet, endearing grade school girl who enjoys being a tom boy.  Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennett), the children's father, is concerned primarily with his own wants and deeply resents the attention and material things Mildred lavishes upon Veda.  With the loss of his job, he walks out on Mildred and the girls, leaving behind a mountain of bills.<br />Taking action, Mildred takes a job waiting tables in town in addition to the baking she already does for her neighbors.  Befriended by Ida Corwin (Eve Arden) she quickly learns the ropes.  Soon she can afford piano and dance lessons for Veda and Kay, all the while keeping her place of employment a secret from the girls because she fears Veda's reaction.  However, Veda snoops around until she learns the truth and confronts her mother.  Lying to Veda, Mildred explains that she is just learning the nuts and bolts of running a restaurant so she can have her own.  With the help of Wally Fay (Jack Carson), former business partner of Bert's, she makes a deal with a lazy cad named Monte Beragon, played by Zachary Scott, to open a restaurant in a property he has for sale.  &quot;Mildred's&quot; is such a success she soon opens a chain of them.  She has made it and Veda will finally be happy!  Sadly this is not the case.<br />Still seeking Veda's love and approval Mildred marries a man she can barely tolerate.  Now she has an even bigger and better home with nice new furnishings.  Surely this will satisfy her daughter!  But Veda has other plans and sabotages everything Mildred has worked so hard to obtain.  <br />I truly enjoyed &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot;, a film that transports the audience to a world decades in the past.  Even so, its illustration of to what extent people are willing to go in order to get what they want, regardless the price, remains forever timeless.
0385507755|3.0|I must admit that I'm puzzled by all the completely positive reviews, if only because I didn't find there to be much \\"there\\" there.  Frey is an excellent stylist, and his rambling, run-on sentences are entertaining to digest, but there's not so much plot to carry the action.<br />Perhaps this is why I was completely enthralled for the first 100 pages, when Frey first entered recovery and then, well, rather bored the rest of the way.  It's rather delicious to read brutally honest passages about a drug addict before he cleans up, but those passages -- the ones about needing a fix and refusing a fix and looking up at the sun and then needing a fix again -- become trite and dull.<br />If you're looking for a great drug book, I'd try WSB first.  At least he takes you somewhere (where his imagination intersects with his addition) that's somewhat interesting.
B00007EBAG|5.0|I know those are strong words considering such efforts as &quot;Symphony or Damn&quot; and &quot;Hardline,&quot; but this album more than any other shows his range (both vocally and musically) and song writing skills better than any other TTD release.<br />Where &quot;Vibrator&quot; tried too hard to reach a higher level spiritually, &quot;Wildcard&quot; (formerly known as &quot;The Soular Return of Terence Trent D'Arby&quot;) gets back to great music with messages to which we can all relate.<br />&quot;O Divina&quot; seems at first to be the wrong lead track, but after several listens you will realize why it's the perfect choice for this album.  The dirty funk of &quot;Designated Fool&quot; and &quot;Suga Free,&quot; the electronica-tinged &quot;SRR-636,&quot; the beautiful &quot;What Shall I Do?&quot; and the pure pop genius of &quot;...And They Will Never Know&quot; keep the record rolling.<br />Throughout the entire album, TTD's amazing voice is front and center.  He has truly not lost any of this amazing gift, and is not afraid to show it off.<br />Although some tracks falter (specifically those recorded and released after the original &quot;download only&quot; version of the album), the album as a whole is still more consistently great than 90% of the other stuff there.  Some might say it may have benefitted from a little editing (it's basically two full ablums' worth of material), but this collection contains enough variety to satisfy every music fan.<br />Peace.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I don't just dole out 5-star reviews to anything that I think is simply \\"cool\\" or \\"awesome\\". When I say 5 stars, I mean it's an absolute work of out, incredible, and I cannot recommend it more to you, the viewer who has not yet seen this.<BR>Regardless of your taste in films, regardless of whether this film would make you sick, it should still be required viewing.<BR>Its the story of 4 drug addicting and their sickening plummit into anguish and darkness. And this movie will take you with the. Based on the brilliant novel by Hubert Selby JR, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM will stay with you forever, the memory of the agony it instills imprinted on your brain forever.<BR>Never overwraught, splendidly acted, this is a near-perfect adaption of the novel, employing the latest and most effective tricks of the movie-medium to fill in for aspacts of the novel that cannot be expressed on the screen, to great effect. Beautifully disgusting, poignant, and above all, its still and ENTERTAINING film
B00005J6T0|5.0|True Blue is truly wonderful as I stated in my title because its fun, makes you wanna dance,has great messages in the songs(without being cheesy and preachy),this is a pop music cd but its not cold and unfeeling it has warmth and is totally inviting you to forget your worries and just get lost in the music.<BR> The tracks including the bonus remixes are all enjoyable you will not want to skip a single song and you may find yourself listening to this cd over and over and over as I have also Madonna sounds incredible! add \\"True Blue\\" to your cd collection now!  you will not be dissapointed that you did!
B0000931QR|5.0|From the opening cut (&quot;Puedes Contar Conmigo&quot;) to the bonus track you'll find a great variety of tempos and vocal styles.  It's hard to choose a favorite but &quot;Nadie como tú&quot; and &quot;Geografia&quot; are my top candidates.<br />Our whole family loves this group.  Even if you don't understand Spanish, you'll love their music, too.  If you've never heard their music, it's a Latin-influenced pop, not overly produced, and dancable.  What makes this group outstanding is the lead singer: Amaia Montero.  Her voice is both fabulous and versatile.   Both previous releases are great (&quot;Dile al Sol&quot; and &quot;El Viaje de Copperpot&quot;) and this one shows they are still going strong.<br />Buy all three CDs from La Oreja; you won't be sorry.
B0000027RL|5.0|I really didn't get into Pearl Jam until about 1998. I had heard their super popular songs Even flow, Alive, Black, and Jeremy and liked them a alot. A a stuggling guitarist able only to play the simplistic Nirvana style riffs, the incredable soloing here by PJ lead guiatar player is what caught me. WoW! Check out Porch, Garden, Even Flow, Alive, and Once for some incredable guitar work. <BR>Fueled by Vedder's incredable voice and lyrics this is a CD with not one weak track. Since i have purcahsed this CD I have purcahsed many subsequent PJ titles such as Vs. Vitalogy, No code, and Yeild. It has been nice getting into a band that has grown and improved over their long twelve year or so existance. Now I kno why they are so well respected by peers like Pete Townsend, Chris Cornell, Flea, Neil Young, and Michael Stripe. <BR>Ten is now up there as one of my favorite pure rock cds with Led Zepplin III, Jimmi Hendrix Are u Experinced, and Beatles White ALbum. I kno its high calibur, but Pearl Jam's has outsold any other grunge band for a reason: its a classic album!
B000089RVX|4.0|the best thing to come out the average movie daredevil was the stunning soundtrack...but most of all the track  &quot;Bring me to life&quot; and the introduction to the group Evanescence. &quot; Bring me to life&quot; is a haunting song. But at the same time it rocks...<br />this group is wicked, fronted by a female with pipes that soar and is haunting at times. But the band still rocks it hard...love this group this is one the best new bands to come out of the underground scene..
B00005JMFR|3.0|I would give a rating of three star(at first) as the movie could contain lots of action pact within a short time frame of creating one....fantastic....superman style of making movies..hee hee....it will be a big astonishment if big waves of people go for this one but ending up with a so so movie...hee hee...its showtime for this coming November....:-)
014028009X|4.0|Charmless but highly imaginative, Bridget Jones Diary records the pathetic life of a woman with nothing better to do than obsess about men while reveling in food, cigarettes, and booze.<br />Brilliant humor helps the reader machete through this morass of gluttony and selfishness.  Names evoke smiles like boss Perpetua who perpetually talks at work and Vile Richard the commitment-phobic boyfriend.  Caricatures abound.  TV guru Richard Finch frequently adds the phrase \\"I'm thinking\\" before a sentence.  For example: \\"I want you on-camera.  I'm thinking miniskirt.  I'm thinking fireman's helmet.  I'm thinking pointing the hose.\\"  And there are many amusing references to old romance novels like Pride & Prejudice.<br />Unfortunately, many jokes fall flat like Bridget and Michael's geeky e-mail chats about an anthropomorphized skirt.  And there's the grandma caricature who makes \\"funny\\" remarks at Christmastime, for instance, picking up a tube of Smarties and saying \\"Oh look, a penis.\\"<br />But flat jokes are not as bad as the sickening ones.  Bridget is an alcoholic.  At the end of the year she proudly states she lived 114 \\"Hangover-free days\\".  Sometimes she writes in a drunken stupor: \\"2. a.m. Gor es wor blurry ggofun tonight though.\\"  Some people may think this is funny, but nondrinkers will likely be disgusted.<br />Still, it is the eating that really grosses out.  Raspberry surprise, pizza, Swiss Mountain bars, salmon pinwheels, Milk trays, etc. are gobbled up and recorded.  Bridget is constantly referring to food, even when she's not eating it.  Yo-yo dieting doesn't help.  And the tiresome daily calorie counting indicates this method produces a zero effect.<br />Overall, the diary presents a very unflattering portrait of Bridget.  In the end when she hooks up with a decent fellow, you wonder what he sees in her.  She appears to have few inner qualities to attract a guy like that.  Perhaps it is luck.  Bridget herself admits when playing the lottery:  \\"I do quite often win.\\"
074345295X|1.0|&quot;The Tempest&quot; is the least interesting Shakespeare play I have read. &quot;Macbeth,&quot; &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;Othello&quot; were much more thrilling.<br />  &quot;The Tempest&quot; seems like it's lost somewhere between a tragdy and a comedy. I couldn't tell which characters I should empathize with, and teh only emotion it gave me was &quot;meh.&quot; In the back of the book it's listed as a romance, which is surprising since the romance is a minor part of the story.<br />  The only way &quot;The Tempest&quot; can work is if very good actors play the parts. By just reading it, the main character Prospero is very ambiguous, as to whether he is benevolent or malevolent. It probably takes a good actor to interpret him just right, to capture the audience's emotions. Unfortunately, the film I saw had horrible actors, all overacting to their limits, and that just made my opinion of this play even lower.<br />  Sure, there is some social commentary in the play. But all in all, I was expecting more from Will.
0792165020|5.0|This is a superbly adapted, dark and unsettling thriller with fantastic casting and acting. It is a really clever film-maker's experiment which leaves you haunted and shaken and even quite depressed. <br />The thing about The Talented Mr Ripley, is that you really want to like Ripley (or whatever his real name is). You empathise, you want him to get away with things...and the film toys with you in building this up, but then crushing you with his immorality. And all through the film however bad it gets you're willing to forgive that immorality, until very end, where it over-steps the mark, and the film ends, leaving you feeling quite shaken.<br />However it is an incredible film, and reccomended by all accounts.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Naysayers will say what they will, but I say \\"Say You Will\\" is a great album. Lindsey Buckingham's guitar playing is, in a word, mind blowing! His melodic fingerstyle wizardry is very much alive and well and he serves up some amazing and brilliant embellishments throughout. This is a great guitar album, with soaring lead solos, fantastic classical and Renaissance touches, trippy magic mushroom moments, and some terrific psychedelic 60s raga guitar perhaps inspired by the early days of Buckingham/Nicks when they performed in and around San Francisco, opening for Jimi Hendrix, et al. He is the consummate melodic guitar player, and it is truly genius what he comes up with, especially his arrangements for Nicks. Additionally, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie's contributions couldn't be any more outstanding than what they deliver on this record. Do youself a favor and tune in exclusively to McVie's bass lines, and you will see wherein the genius of Fleetwood Mac begins.<br />My favorite song on the CD, and the one that most represents the power of Nicks and Buckingham together is \\"Everybody Finds Out.\\" This ranks up there as one of my favorite Mac tunes of all time. It ROCKS majorly. I just wish they'd featured a dualing duet on the song, \\"Come.\\" Seems like the perfect song for them to trade shots at each other back and forth. <br />My only minor gripes about the album are the two moments of studio excess where Lindsey throws in some \\"helium\\" sounding vocals... I can just picture Stevie's protests in the studio, as both helium moments happen on her songs (\\"Say You Will\\" being one of them.) But then again, he's not like other people, he does what he wants to, as Stevie would say...<br />SAY YOU WILL is an outstanding addition to the Fleetwood Mac catalog, and one that will absolutely stand the test of time. I'm just thankful they are still making major music together, and that I can still really sink my teeth into the BIG MAC!!!!
B00002SSKI|5.0|Better than &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, this coming of age movie from the feminine side is so perfectly cast that there is never a moment of boredom and you really do care for all of the characters.  This is one super movie, it immediately made my top 10 list so I cannot recommend it enough.  The chemistry between the young girl super-cast is a delight.  Don't think about renting this movie--purchase it and save the rental fee.  All movies should be this good!
0802130208|4.0|Intelligence doesn't always provide you with a money making job.  People have to be willing to work with their colleagues to get things done.  John Kennedy Toole creates for us in his book A Confederacy of Dunces a character named Ignatius J. Reilly who has the opportunity to work but doesn't.  The reason he doesn't is because he can't seem to get along with the people he works with.  People come to dislike him because of his behavior and his physical attributes.  As a person he belittles his friends and his colleagues, he will not listen to any one who challenges his word, and he is just down right lazy: a sloth of a sophisticate.<BR> Ignatius J. Reilly distinguishes himself as a philosopher, a bourgeoisie, and a genius.  He is none of the above.  In reality he is just an overweight man who lives with his mother, and gets carried away in his imagination.  As a person though, he believes that he is a figure of much importance.  When he is let loose on the streets of New Orleans people ignore him and laugh at his ideas.  Those who he comes to know, though, hate him because of his overly conservative view on life.  He creates trouble for himself when he writes an obnoxious letter of complaint, gets fired for leading a mock strike, tries to create a political party, and upsets his mother.<BR> He loves to express his own opinions much like this one, \\"I refuse to `look up.'  Optimism nauseates me.  It is perverse.  Since man's fall, his proper position in the universe has been one of misery\\" (59).  It is because of these opinions he is disliked by people in general.  In one passage of the book he compares himself with African Americans.  \\"In a sense I have always felt something of a kinship with the colored race because its position is the same as mine: we both exist outside the inner realm of the American society\\" (122).  They are both outcasts.   African Americans are disliked because of their skin color, and he is disliked because of his radical opinions.<BR> There are not many people who like him and want to help him.  His mother and a friend from University are the only ones who seem to care for him.  His friend from University had this to say to him in a letter she wrote: \\"Realize that life is surging around you.  The valve closes because it thinks it is living in a dead organism.  Open your heart Ignatius and you will open your valve\\" (215).  Ignatius doesn't listen to most advice except for this piece given from an old friend.  He decides to accomplish something for himself out in the big bad world, and this is when he tries to create a political party.   Countless times Ignatius has tried to succeed at something and has failed miserably.  His mother wishes he would seek out psychological help for his faults.  Ignatius however, accepts his faults and lives with them, and having somebody try to change him as a person would kill his character.  This is why he feels angered by his mother's solution to all his problems.  \\"...Striving is ultimately meaningless...we must learn to accept\\" (298).  Ignatius wants his mother to accept him as the person he already is.  His mother is unwilling to accept the son that she gave birth to.<BR> As an early twentieth century book A Confederacy of Dunces illustrates how people acted after the World Wars.  People were beginning to criticize each other about their personal lives, religion and political view.  African Americans were just starting to be accepted in society.  One of the major out-lying themes in the book and the time period for that matter is acceptance.  How did people accept each person's problem?  John Kennedy Toole shows us with the characters of this book how each person dealt with another person's problem.  The book itself may be heavy reading and somewhat confusing but it is well worth reading.  It reminds us of how life has changed since the post World War Era, and it covers many themes of today that people in general can relate too.
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is inevitably the Cure album which gets mentioned in \\"classic albums\\" lists, in \\"reccomend me a Cure album\\" answers and so forth. Rightly so - its an incredible record, though many other Cure records are in fact just as great too. It has some incredible songs, and is gothic, dark and almost holy in tone - like a rite or ritual. This isn't the place for either the experiments and eclecticism of albums like 'Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me' or the really brutal straightahead goth of 'Pornography', but its an unmissable chapter in the evolution of the Cure.<br />The epic opening of 'Plainsong' still sparkles, even if its synths haven't aged too well. 'Love Song' remains a touching and darkly beautiful pop song, 'Lullaby' a chilling, spiky gothic pop exercise and 'Fascination Street' a dark and haunting masterwork with an incredible bassline - perhaps the quintessential Cure track, in fact. The songs on this album are long, epic, desolate and slow - particularly in the second half of the album, which is superior even to the brilliance first half. 'Prayers For Rain' sways turbulently and the tile track drives forward with its soaring bass and incredible lyrics - up there as one of the all-time great epics. It utilses a fantastic keyboard sound too.<br />Disintegration actually takes a few listens to get into - its not as immediate as other Cure albums like the also excellent but rather different 'Wish' which followed next. At first, much may sound very similar or even underwhelming, but given time, this record is rewarding. All you need is headphones, an isolated room and the lyrics booklet in your hand, and it'll pull you in and never let go. 5 stars.
0425152251|4.0|Sophie's World is an easy-to-understand history of philosophy wrapped in a novel wrapped in a novel (whew!). How many books can you say that about? Basically, our heroine, Sophie Amundsen, comes home one day to discover that a mysterious philosopher has contacted her. They embark on a sort of philosophy by mail course; soon they meet, and the philosophy courses are given in dialogues (probably not a coincidence, considering some of the first ever philosophical writings were written in the form of dialogues). Simultaneously, Sophie starts recieving mysterious postcards addressed to someone named Hilde....Hilde becomes a mystery that Sophie must unravel if she is to determine the nature of her own existence.<br />Sophe's World is enjoyable and informative. At first, though, some readers may be tempted to skip over the philosophy and rush right into the novel; however, as the book progesses, the plot(s) become pretty contrived --it becomes more tempting to skip through the novel and jump right into the philosophy. Sophie herself can get a little annoying at times, and her plot portions may become exasperating, but it's worth reading. Despite this book's size, it is an easy read, but still it should be read with care and thoughtfulness.<br />The most attention in this compact little 'history' is given to Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume, Berkeley, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Sartre. Also mentioned are historical shifts and trends--the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, etc--in order to give a little more perspective. What is included is very informative and interesting, however, it should be known that many important philosophers are either mentioned in passing or given little attention, and a few are omitted entirely. But all and all it is a good book, presenting information and explaining, making it easily accessible to anyone who'd like it. The point of the book, and of philosophy in general, is to get readers thinking,and it accomplishes that well. It is a good starting point for anyone with an interest in the subject, providing a nice overview so that after reading and digesting it, readers can then begin to pursue works mentioned with relative ease.
0316666343|1.0|I was anxious to read this novel, because it has been on the bestseller list for 44 weeks, which must be some kind of record. But I can't divine what people like about it. The first chapter is almost cheaply titillating and creepy, and then it becomes very very predictable. Alice Sebold, I think, is a keen observer of the obvious. \\"Nothing is revealed,\\" as Bob Dylan once wrote. The NY Times reviewer gushed on about it being a heartfelt and keenly observed insight into family relationships. You can't prove that by me. It just goes to prove the old saying that one man's meat is another man's poisson, as a friend of mine used to say in France. This is definitely more fish than meat. (No disrespect intended to the fish.)
B00003OSTV|5.0|Quo Vadis, while less known than Ben Hur or Spartacus, holds its own among the very best of the classic Hollywood Roman Epics.  More than a &quot;sword and sandals&quot; film, Quo Vadis is lavish as one expects, but also crackling with wit, humor, and truly outstanding supporting performances.  <br />Peter Ustinov as the matricidal tone-deaf emperor Nero and Leo Genn as witty and urbane Gaius Petronius (the author of the Satyricon) both received academy award nominations for best supporting actor, and it is my theory that they split the Oscar vote because they are both superb.  My only complaint about the movie is that there just isn't enough of Petronius, whose insightful &quot;flattery&quot; of Nero's poetry and music leave me howling with each viewing.<br />Robert Taylor is initially somewhat irritating, althought it is appropriate for the role.  Marcus Vinicius is proud, arrogant, and annoying, yet grows as a character.  Taylor's biggest drawback as an actor in this case, aside from his stiff manner, may simply be that he does not have the same patrician accent as most of the actors and actresses around him.<br />See this film in widescreen, if possible.  The sheer spectacle--of massive banquets, triumphal processions, and the fiery conflagration of Rome burning--make this lavish epic something not to be missed.
B00004XPPC|3.0|The movie is about a Japanese prisoner of war camp, during World War II, and a British unit that enters into it with a commander who is determined to keep unity and professionalism during their imprisonment, a truly noble idea.  However, he is faced with a POW camp leader who doesn't abide by the rules.  At the same time there is another important character; this is one American leader who has been prisoner at the camp since it was built.  He just wants to escape and look out for his own interest.  The director does a good job of contrasting both the stubborn and proud British officer to the independent and cunning American leader, and this can be said to compare and contrast the stereotypical Americans and the British in general during World War II.  I liked how these views came into conflict, but in my opinion it took to long to show the conflict and then too long to resolve it.  Well, it's okay, maybe one to chalk up among the many World War II movies you should see but it's nothing special.
0684833395|5.0|As a high school junior, one might think Catch-22 would be a challenge. This is true, for the writing is very different, and it is at times very hard to follow the story. But, if you can find it within your heart to forgive Catch-22 that minor misgiving, then you certainly would feel the same way about it that I do that Catch-22 is a very good book.<BR> There are several characters in the book, but the one that Catch-22 is rooted to is Yossarian, who throughout the whole book is always wondering why people he has never met are trying to kill him. His wondering why leads him to try to leave the army in any way possible, but he is always confronted with \\"catch-22\\", which in his case means he can leave the army if he is crazy, and he must be crazy to fly the dangerous bombing runs, but, and here's the catch, \\"anyone who wants to get out of combat duty isn't really crazy...that a concern for one's own safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind\\". Catch-22 is used in different situation throughout the book, each with its own underling meaning.<BR> A major point the book conveys is the line between sanity and insanity. As seen by the \\"catch-22\\" for Yossarian, it seems to us he is really crazy, for who would walk around all day for months naked. Yet, after getting into the book, the reader comes to realize Yossarian is the only sane person in the whole outfit. This new idea of  those who are crazy are sane, and visa versa, leads in to the theme of the later half of the book, the stupidity of  army politics. During the story, there are countless times when idiotic things occur because the ones in charge fell it necessary. For instance, in a mission that a member of Yossarian's crew is killed, Yossarian gets a metal. <BR> With what I have said, you can see how the book is confusing at times. But don't let that scare you away. Catch-22 is one of the best books of the 20th century, and it is also a very funny book. I recommendit to any who are willing to try something new, for Catch-22 is a challenge, and what could be better for to read than a challenging book full, of humor, about a war...kind of reminds me of \\"M.A.S.H.\\", but not as serious.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I had no idea what to expect when popping this one into the DVD player. At first I thought it was bit much with the main character cutting herself and then submitting to spanking and domination by James Spader (Way creepy. What is it with that guy anyway?). But there's a humor there I haven't seen and an unexpected sweetness...by the end I was bewitched by this movie and all its weirdness. Horribly addicted, I watched it twice in one day, back to back. And I'll probably do the same thing tomorrow. This just made my top 10 fav movie of all time list. <br />So if you are looking for something offbeat, unusual, and refreshing from Hollywood, this would be a great place to start. I havent had a movie touch me like this since....I don't know. :)<br />The soundtrack is also incredible, check it out. I havent stopped listening to it for days.
0385504209|5.0|This was the most fun I have had reading a book in a long time.  A really tightly written murder mystery wrapped in an enigma.  Great characters, fast action (454 pages and most of the story takes place in about 18 hours), plot twists to make your head spin, Art, Religion, History . . . Sorry, I have to get back to reading it AGAIN!
0345451325|5.0|You may or may not have played the game, but either way this is the story that preludes it all.  This book covers most of the life of a few unique individuals, the Master Chief and his fellow Spartans.  This book follows much of the development of the Spartan program and the fight against the Covenant.  Yes, this is the book where you meet such characters as Cortana and Keyes, but you meet others such as Dr. Halsey, the founder of the Spartan program.  This book covers much of what the normal Halo player does not know and it gives great insight into the life of the Master Chief, the character you are in the Halo game.  This is just a great book.  Although I preferred the Halo book I think this is right about there with it.  So read this one first to get the intro, then read the book and if you haven't played the game already, do that.  Even if you're not a Halo fan now, you probably will be, or you'll just enjoy this as being a good sci-fi action book.

0767836324|5.0|Hook, of the greatest action/adventure movie of all time. With a Star cast including: Dustin Hoffman (Captain James Hook), Robin Williams (Peter Banning), and Julia Roberts (Tink). A workaholic, Peter Banning has no time for his family. The family takes a trip to London to visit Granny Wendy because she is to receive an award. While at the award ceremony, Peters children are captured. A note is left by the kidnapper signed, Captain James Hook. Tink takes Peter to Neverland, where he is to fight the dark and sinister Hook for his children. Peter has to learn to find his happy thought and become the old Pan in three days. And so the Great War between good and evil begins. Hook receives the five stars of excellence for being one of the greatest films of that year.<BR> The musical score for Hook is an essential part in this mind blowing movie. John Williams makes this score a quintessential example of how to capture emotion. The piece was actually intended on being a musical for Peter Pan, before Stephen Spielberg wanted the score for his movie. The music does exactly what every musical does; it creates music that becomes very present in ones memory. Most musicians would categorize this score as more pop than the average score. John Williams actually started writing the score before he even saw the completed version of the film. John basically had to go off of a script to write the music. John had to create his own Neverland in his head to create the right emotion he wanted to present to the audience. One section of the score is called, Presenting the Hook. The scene starts out with Smee carrying Captain Hooks hook all over the ship. The pirates start chanting, Hook, Hook, Hook, as they follow Smee. Mr. Williams creates perfect pirate music. It is filled with: horns, violins, tambourines, flutes, and drums. The sound creates the image of a pirate ship in ones mind. The battle sequence is another great section of work called, The Ultimate War. There are great sums of percussion, such as cymbals and cowbells. These percussion sounds, especially the cowbell, paints a picture of the preparation of war. Then one hears the upbeat sounds and at that moment, Peter has transformed into a hero. Eerie and evil sounds are played into the audiences ears. This sound is the presents of Hook. As the section continues the tempo increases drastically. The score is one of the top elements in making this movie superior to other movies. <BR> Captain James Hook, played by Dustin Hoffman, gives this movie what it needs to become a classic. Captain Hook is the leader of the scum of Neverland (also known as pirates). Hook has grown tired of killing Indians and lost boys. The climatic adventure in his life would be to kill Peter Pan, his arch nemesis. Dustin Hoffman did a magnificent job creating this character. One of the most valuable elements of his character was his appearance and voice. The costume designer designed his costume exactly like it is in the Walt Disney version of Peter Pan. From the wig to the mustache, Dustin fits the part. Dustins voice is the ideal voice of a pirate. His voice gave one a feeling as if one had left Great Britain and had been captured by pirates. Dustin Hoffmans character had to be nothing but fun to act.<BR> This movie is a perfect example of a monomyth. Peters call to action is that his children have been captured and he has to go and save them. Tink takes Peter from the house in London and he crosses the threshold into Neverland. He leaves the social realm and goes forth into the supernatural realm. Peter has to find his happy thought, so that he can fly. His gift is hidden within himself. The trials he faces are the Ultimate War between the lost boys and the pirates. His ultimate trial is fighting Captain James Hook. He defeats his opponent and takes his children home. When he leaves Neverland to go back to London, he emerges back into the social realm. Peter brings back what hehas learned from his experiences. Not the gift of flying, but the gift of loving his family more and living life to the fullest.<BR> The overall score for this movie is Five Stars out of Five Stars. The score is based on the musical score, characters, and plot. One essential element is the score written by John Williams. The score brought to story to life. Another element evaluated was Dustin Hoffmans role of Captain James Hook. The last element taken into consideration was the how the plot was planned. The plot used the journey of a monomyth. The journey of the monomyth has been used in many other great films, such as Star Wars. This movie has become a masterpiece that other directors should model after .Hook is truly magnificent
0800141660|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  I won't go into details about the movie itself; many others here have already done that quite adequately.  Let me tell you what I like about this particular DVD release.<br />I bought this when I realized it has been re-released with extras.  (I believe the first outing was pretty much bare bones.)<br />The audio commentary with Emma Thompson is more than worth the price of the movie.  Absolutely hilarious.  As is the clip of her speech at the Golden Globes - written as if penned by Jane Austen herself.<br />We still haven't digested Ang Lee's commentary; but the disc is well worth the price so far.<br />Buy it and enjoy!  Thanks for reading.
B000066NW0|2.0|Ok. Avril Lavigne IS NOT a punk rocker. She's a n teen idol, in the same path of Britney, Christina or Natalie Imbruglia. She sings some kind of soft pop-rock music, adequate for your little sister or the part of you that will always be 13 year old and wips with \\"Dawsons Creek\\".<BR>I think she will be forgotten in two or three years, but you can enjoy this CD as it is: instant soup music or bubblegum rock. If you want real punk rock (Ramones, Sex Pistols, Rancid, the-local-guys-who-play-in-the-funky-hole), you don't even disturb in reviewing it or telling people why they shouldnt listen to it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I was privileged to see a two hour preview at the cinema last night. Let me tell you - This is going to blow you away ! The Albert Hall performances were probably the most impressive because of sense of a 'just arrived' band and Percy's voice but on the whole the quality of the musicianship and restored sound was incredible. Only 'Stairway' from Knebworth sounded 'tired'.<BR>Standouts for me were 'In my time of dying' from 1975 and 'Nobody's fault but mine' from 1979. Can't wait for the DVD !
B000002AHM|5.0|I first heard this on vinyl.  Properly awed, I promptly listened to all the other instrumental guitar music I could find.  Now, twenty years or so later, I'd challenge critics:  Name the OTHER acoustic guitar recording that even meets, let alone surpasses, the standard set by &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco.&quot;  I love Leo Kottke and Allan Holdsworth and Phil Keaggy and all the rest, but this is still the pre-eminent acoustic recording.<BR>Here are two points to consider:<BR>(1)  Critics talk about the emotion and beauty being lost in the fireworks.  Certainly the fireworks take up the majority of the CD, but listen again to the quiet moment right before the conclusion of &quot;Short Tales of the Black Forest,&quot; where one of the guitarists even tells the rowdy crowd, &quot;Shut up, now&quot; (and, by the way, when was the last time you heard a live performer have to tell the crowd to curb its enthusiasm?).  Or what about the haunting, eerie melody of the middle section of &quot;Fantasia Suite&quot;?  You'll hear it in your dreams.<BR>So, first of all, this recording does have the &quot;beautiful&quot; moments.  But that leads into the second response:<BR>(2)  Don't miss the point!  This is not supposed to be a meditative hour to play in the background while you eat your tofu meat loaf.  These three guitarists clearly wanted to have fun with each other, to provoke each other to better performance, and, primarily, to blow away the listener who never thought acoustic guitar could sound remotely like this.  If judged by these criteria, &quot;Friday Night in San Francisco&quot; deserves seven or eight stars instead of five.
0553278398|5.0|A full and proper start to this epic story of mathemetician and Psycohistorian Hari Seldon.  His prediction for the future of the galaxy he knows, one where the human race with the help of robots have created an empire so grand, all has to come to an end.  This story takes us on the great Flight the Hari had to endure as his prediction of humanity's survival did not impress the emperor in the slightest.<br />The old tale of where humans came from is dotted in this book as with all the Asimov epics of this story.  Characters are introduced that would be a major influence in the Foundation trilogy as well as the next prequil, Forward the Foundation.<br />Reading it before or after the Trilogy dosen't really matter but treat the second prequil as a continuation of the first.
0345440900|5.0|I really loved this book as a new mother.  Not only did it contain helpful hints for every situation I came across with my son, it had this great encouraging and humorous tone! I needed to hear how this whole baby-care thing was maybe not a molehill, but it didn't have to be a mountain either.  Very practical and down-to-earth, and full of very accessible information.  I particularly found her tables with estimated feed times, amounts, and others very helpful, as a lot of books don't seem to dare to put even a rough estimate on these things.  I bought several books, but this is the one I keep returning to the most.
B00000K19E|5.0|The matrix is the best movie i have ever seen. It blends the awesome world of CGI technology with live action stunts and actually has a plot!

B00002MZ4W|5.0|What can I say about this collection of tracks that hasn't already been said? It's simply superb.<br />What makes Fiona Apple so amazing is that the level of quality in every aspect of her music is so incredibly (almost ridiculously) high.<br />First off, that voice... no words can do it justice. If you've heard it, you know that there are few voices anywhere in music today that can compare. It's disciplined, it's smooth, it's sexy, it's emotive and at the same time, it's loose and effortless. It's one of those rare voices that is instantly recognizable and endlessly listenable.<br />Next, the writing... Fiona's first outing, Tidal, had some of the best lyrics in pop music. It's not uncommon to hear fans of any artist claim that their favorite songs are great \\"poetry\\" and I'm sure that a million listeners said the same thing about Tidal. With \\"When the Pawn...\\" however, the maturity, subtlety and skill in the writing actually create verses that count among the best that current poets in the literary world have to offer, something that in reality almost *never* occurs in popular music. These words are for real,  never precious, never overwrought, brilliantly incisive, ironic, playful, clever and very deep. Amazing writing on this album that could just as easily have been performed at a poetry slam.<br />Finally, the performance... even the best lines can be ruined by an unskilled performer, and even the best performers can sometimes deadpan a solid line. But her performance here--across every single track on this disc--is flawless for the material, flawless for her voice, and flawless for the continuity of the album itself. Not only does Fiona know her limits and work them to her advantage, she also manages to do it without losing sight of the structure of the album, without overreaching and without creating any of those \\"disappointing\\" moments that too often mar what would otherwise be stellar recordings.<br />This album appeared to be an instant classic when it was released, drenched in smoky rainy afternoon jazz-house groove, and it has only grown better with age. One for the canons of music history. Don't be without it.released, drenched in smoky rainy afternoon jazz-house groove, and it has only grown better with age. One for the canons of music history.

0451207521|4.0|Ken Follett has been doing this sort of thing for years. His best work, other than perhaps the atypical historical novel The Pillars of the Earth, has been set in World War II, with Nazi and Allied spies chasing one another across the battlefields and occupied countries of the war. This latest entry starts with a shootout between French partisans, led by a British agent, and Germans at a communications center in occupied Normandy. The action takes place on the eve of D-Day, and the attack fails. The leader, however, is a determined woman named Felicity (Flick) Clairet, and she's one stubborn lady. She decides to try again, more subtly.<br />The action of the book follows Flick through her return to England, recruiting a very different team of irregular operatives to perform the mission, and their subesequent adventures in France. It alternates between this and the activities of a Nazi intelligence officer, a former policeman named Dieter Franck. Dieter is determined to stop the invasion and catch Flick, who he thinks can lead him to various resistance leaders in France.<br />The problem with the book, such as it is, is a strange one. The author seems unclear as to whether the Nazis are evil or not, as a group. Franck definitely isn't motivated by any animus towards Jews or anything, he merely wishes to protect Germany from invaders, and is willing to do things like torture people in order to achieve his goal. He has a beautiful French Jew for a girlfriend, and throws himself on her to shield her body when there's shooting, so you know he's attached to her. This creates a strange atmosphere for the novel: there's a sort of moral equivalence that's a bit distasteful. My wife tried the audio of this some time ago, and tells me that she had trouble caring about any of the characters, and stopped listening to the story before she finished it.<br />With that one (big) misgiving aside, this is a good book, and very well written. It's definitely worth the effort.
B000000W4M|5.0|I can remember when tracks from Siamese Dream could regularly be heard on alternative rock radio and it seemed like just the next great album from another alternative band.<br />Little did we know how spoiled we were in the first half of the '90s, with incredible music bursting out of every nook and cranny. It was easy, at the time, to take Siamese Dream and stunningly painful, cynical, longing-filled tracks like Mayonaise, Today and Soma entirely for granted.<br />A decade later, with the rotting litter of what was once rock laying everywhere in great heaps, the greatness of this period in time is much more apparent. And Siamese Dream stands out, along with one or two other important discs, as one of the seminal albums of the period.<br />If you haven't thought about these tracks in years, or God forbid you've never even heard them, get ahold of this disc now and give it a listen. I guarantee that the opening chords of Today will make you sneer and squeal, the haunting, cryptic lyrics of Mayonaise will make you tear up without quite knowing why, and somewhere in the middle of Disarm, you will once again fall in love with the killer in you.

B000002NJS|5.0|Back in 1984, when I was 15 years old, I was a \\"Madonna Wannabe\\".  I know that has absolutely nothing to do with this album, but the Madonna I knew and grew to love was a green Madonna, a young, burgeoning woman -- The Madonna in the Borderline video.<br />Now, almost 20 years later, I am a more mature individual(no more rubber bracelets & midriff baring shirts made up of lace), and so is she.  Everything about her has ripened -- her voice, her songwriting, her thoughts, her idea of what her music should be, and with her first child being born right around the time this album was released The Material girl herself has aged very gracefully.  The photo of her on the cover is gorgeous.<br />\\"Ray of Light\\" the first single from the album is one of the most original songs of hers to date -- faster than the speeding light she refers to in the song. No other hit of hers from my rememberence has such a eclectic sound to it.  I can listen to it over and over and find total joy in it's words, it's driving beat, and Madonna's boundless energy.<br />After listening to the entire album for oh, the millionith time, I feel a bit at peace and very alive at the same time.  Listening to it I can picture it being background music for a yoga class or music you'd hear in a nightclub -- music that gets everyone's hips gyrating.<br />It makes me truly happy to love this album as much as I love the very first Madonna record I had which was simply titled \\"Madonna\\".  Sure, \\"Lucky star\\", \\"borderline\\", and \\"Everybody\\" are not remotely close to sounding like the songs featured here but this is a good thing.  It is a spectacular feat to have your fans love all your work that span over 20 years.  Madonna has never disappointed me with any of her music.  \\"Ray of Light\\"  beams with a mix of ballads and dance tunes with profound lyrics and funky beats. In my honest opinion, it's pure brilliance.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This CD is truely amazing.

B00008I8IF|4.0|Rainy Day Music is a finely produced, pure sounding recording that truly captures the songwriting and vocal talents of one of the most underrated talents in music today, Gary Louris.  <br />Unlike the Jayhawks two previous efforts, Sound of Lies and Smile, where the band seemed to be experimenting with audio pyrotechnics and pop music production, Rainy Day is a excellently produced album that's beauty is in its subtle refinements that enhance, but do not drown out, Gary's guitar and vocal work.<br />Tracks 1-6 are as strong as any that Gary has ever penned.  &quot;The Eyes of SarahJane&quot; may be the best power pop tune that I have heard in several years.  Track 7-14 are not as strong as Gary defers to Tim on &quot;Don't Let the World Get In Your Way&quot; and &quot;Tampa to Tulsa.&quot;  To Tim's credit, his songwriting and vocals continue to mature and grow on this effort, but still pale in comparison to Gary's work.<br />Gary continues to see himself as a member of a band and, as a result, we are able to see The Jayhawks continue to grow in their identity.  <br />The bonus CD is an added plus.  I particularly enjoy &quot;Fools On Parade&quot; which is worthy of being on the first disc.  <br />Overall, Gary and his mates continue to make some of the best pop flavored alt.country music around.
B00006F7S4|5.0|The day this CD was released was the day I broke up with the most wonderful person in the world.  I listened to this CD relentlessly during my getting-over-it phase.

At first she likes the pace of the story and the pictures, but I'm hoping the message will stick as she gets older! :-)  My eight year old niece also has this book and thinks it's great.

B00008J2DQ|5.0|I do honestly not know where to start.  This has got to be by far Godsmack's BEST CD yet!  There is of course more of the wicked guitar solos that you would expect.  This is one of those cds where you dont have to skip around tracks.. There is absolutely no filler on this record.  I give it a 10/10.. A+++<BR>I cannot stress enough what you are missing out on if you don't have this cd yet. By far definately the best record to hit stores in forever.  Go buy it, its never to late!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Ah, the first listen was like, &quot; I have heard this before back when I was young and fresh, sometime in the 80's.&quot;  The second listen was, &quot;I love this album!&quot; Of course, this sounds like the bands from England during the 80's but who cares - most music today sounds rehashed and redone anyhow.  What matters is, can they write great songs?  And yes they do. Think of it as a poppier Joy Division with a touch of The Smiths thrown in it for good measure.  Definitely my top ten album of 2002.
B000068QVN|3.0|A good record of a band firing on all cylinders.<br />I must admit that I could have done without the lengthy drum solo though.<br />Buy the Red Album first then this one.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|It's nice to hear new material from FM. Lindsey Buckingham did a fine production job. Stevie Nicks continues to sound monotone but with the rest of the band sounding great, it doesn't matter. My main complaint is that there's 5 songs that didn't have to be on the CD. I look forward to seeing the band in concert soon.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna just gets better with age - only her two recent CD's, American Life and Music, have I actually been able to listen to the album all the way through!<br />American Life marks a more spiritual, inward-looking Madonna, rather than a superficial, trippy techno diva we're all used to.  Certainly there is plenty of electronically-enhanced vocals, and some interesting sound effects; however, the songs seem to be set in a more simplistic environment--more straight-forward in their approach than some of the complex epics Madonna had in the past (Like A Prayer, Music, etc.).<br />American Life's first half captures you right away; and at first the second half may cause you to doze off, the beauty of it appears after a few listens and thoughts about it.  I find myself able to journey throught the whole album in one sitting (actually it's kinda short, clocking in at less than 50 minutes).<br />Another home run for Madonna; even though she may consider herself more English these days, she still appears to mesh with American life with ease.
0385486804|4.0|Into the Wild is the story of Chris McCandless, a young man from a privileged background who left everything behind to live off the land in Alaska but who starved to death shortly thereafter.  Many who have heard his story have criticized McCandless for his hubris and lack of preparation.  Perhaps those would be my feelings too were it not for Krakauer's sympathetic portrayal of McCandless and others who don't fit into mainstream society and search for a different life on the margins.  Krakauer does a masterful job hunting down the people McCandless met on his journey, presenting historic examples of other misfits, and evoking the hunger for freedom that drives so many adventurers, but then gives the last word to Chris' mother, reminding us that the price paid by those who love and are left behind is severe.
B00005JKPF|3.0|The movie is technically absorbing and, as long as Bryan Singer keeps handling the wheel, he proved once again that the franchise is in good hands.<br />Altough the story plot is good enough, the movie is \\"cold\\". It lacks emotion, it´s something I can´t explain properly... Hugh Jackman steals the show once again, but the rest of the cast, while giving very good performances, failed to give \\"punch\\" to his lines and dialogues. Like I said before, it´s a \\"cold\\" movie.
0062502182|2.0|When you start the book the story of Santiago is cute, when he decide to go for his treasure is a good story, but when he start to speak with the dessert, the wind and the Sun among other things, it is really boring and boring, this book could be great if the writer kept writing real things, things that will really help other people.
B00006G8G1|2.0|The sound is great and the image also is. But watching this DVD back-to-back may be a real pain in the a...You simply are not allowed to focus your eyes more than one second in each scene. It seems it was made on purpose, maybe to compete with the horrible Chritina Aguillera videos...<br />I sold my copy of this one, even loving Iron Maiden. This DVD is unwatchable.
B00008S2VG|5.0|A shock? To some. A disappointment? To some. More to the point, is it any good? To some. Let's get things straight. In my opinion, this album probably marks the end of Madonna's mega sales era. She is now making adventurous music that she wants to make, and getting to grips with what she wants to say. This latest offering shows Maddy in a much different light. It's the most personal she's ever been, and it's all the better for it. The electro-vibe is more toned down than in MUSIC, and this fits with the nature of the songs, and the acoustic sound in many of the songs blends perfectly with it. Disc highlights have to be the beautiful 'Nothing Fails' replete with Gospel Choir, the edgy 'I'm So Stupid', the eminently danceable 'Mother and Father' and 'Easy Ride' with the fabulous looped strings at the end. <br />Some may criticise the simple lyrics on this album, and I have read reviews here that refered to them as 'lazy'. In my view they are simple and clear and show what Madonna was feeling when she wrote them, and bring us that bit closer to getting a real glimpse of the real Madonna.
0316666343|5.0|The thing that made this one of the best books I have ever read is the discussions of the connection between heaven and earth and what heaven may be like.  For example, how Susie's family can not let go of her until she lets go of them and how she can't be in heaven with her deceased relatives until she lets go of what happened.  Although no one knows how it all works....I would like to think that the author is close.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Godsmack since they arrived on the scene years back.  I have been to see them at every opportunity and I was trapped in maine for three days because of the terrorist attacks on Sept 11.  I think this cd rocks, my favorite song on it which i predict will be the 'big seller' once it's released will be Serenity.  Check it out, if you like Godsmacks previous releases , you will ike this one !

B00008S2VG|5.0|THIS IS MADONNA'S MOST ACCOMPLISHED WORK SINCE RAY OF LIGHT.I LOVE EVERY MADONNA ALBUM EVER RELEASED BUT THIS IS REALLY THE BEST ONLY 54 MIN RUNTIME IT IS SHORT AND SWEET.EVERY FAN SHOULD BUY THIS.ALL THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK FOR THIS CD IS RIDICULOUS NO TRUE FAN WOULD DISS THIS AMAZING ALBUM.BUY IT NOW THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO WAIT ON.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Alot of BtVS fans found the episode \\"once more with feeling\\" to be the best of season 6 if not the entire series. Joss Whedom's musical episode was brillant and featured the cast singing their true feelings because of a demonic spell. This gave the whole cast (some more than others) a chance to reach into untapped talents.<br />It is not surprising that the best songs were from estabilshed vocalist anthony head- his song \\"standing\\" was definately a high point.( And be sure to check out his CD \\"music for elevators\\") What was surprising was how well some of the other actors performed- amber benson, emma caufield and james marsters were standouts! But even those with less vocal ability (willow--i think this line's mostly filler--haha) were up to the challenge of this episode.<br />This CD offered a variety of musical styles- pop, alternative rock and broadway to name a few. The best songs were those that featured the entire ensemble- buffy of course, is the ultimate ensemble show. Anthony Head and Amber Benson's mini duet was particularly well done - as was the cast ensemble piece \\"into the fire\\".<br />A nice bonus for buffy fans was the music from past episodes like hush and restless. But if you are a buffy fan, this cd is a must for your collection- you will be singing these songs long after the series finale! (sob)
B00005R87Q|5.0|I found the fast and the furious to be one of the best movies i have ever seen.  I can't even count how many times i have come home from school and sat and ate popcorn and watched this movie.  I can't wait for the next one to make my body pump twice as much adrenaline!

B000025SJ8|5.0|Burzum 'Aske' is Odinic Black Metal beauty and celebrates the liberation of the Viking's bloodline by burning the temples of our wretched enemies, those sick, desert religion, sub-humans. The album is great, especially War and Feeble screams from forests unknown, with their dark, rhytmic, death beats. I, a TRUE Black Metal fan, highly reccomend this album. Remember, Burzum, as well as ALL other TRUE Black and Odinic metal acts are National Socialist Pagans and are for Viking descendants ONLY. As for the Euro/Varg controversey, Euronymous (or at least his image) worshipped death, and he recieved it, and that is a just reward. Don't dwell on any one mortals death, especially if you're into Black Metal. May our Viking blood reign once again!!!! SEIG HEIL!!!!

B00000255F|3.0|I think \\"Born to run\\" is a very over rated album. I own every Springsteen record and I believe \\"Born in the USA\\" together with \\"Tunnel of love\\" is his best work.<br />On this recording there's actually just two or three songs that are top class, namely \\"Thunder road\\", \\"Jungleland\\" and maybe \\"Born to run\\". The rest is not that exciting, at least not for me. Somehow, this album have achieved cult status, and almost no one question the actual quality - \\"you got to praise this one if you consider yourself a Springsteen fan\\". Please, listen and make up your own mind.
B000002J3W|5.0|Unlike most bands who sell out later in their career after coming on strong, Skid Row reversed the process by starting out a bit week with that whole debut album/18 & life sappy cr*p and then blew the world away with Slave to the Grind..which is one of the greatest hard rock/metal albums of all time. An album, many SR fans would have said could not be equaled (think Queensryche Operation Mindcrime..it's all downhill after that). However, Skid Row pulled it off AGAIN, and in fact beat STTG in some ways with this album. I cannot say enough good about this record. It can be used instead of caffeine in the morning, seriously. It is the culmination of everything this band does well..and that's a lot. If you want grungy, raw power in your hard rock, good vocals, rippin guitar, and solid drumming in one package, you've found it. How sad that these guys had to do the typical break-up thing, right when they were on top of the world. I love the crazy weird sh*t on this album like Eileen and Into Another.. very mature for a band that started with a few catchy pop tunes.
B000002L1L|2.0|\\"The battle rages on\\" is far from the heights Deep Purple reached earlier in their career, and some might even wonder if it's the \\"same\\" band that recorded \\"Machine head\\", \\"Burn\\" or \\"Perfect strangers\\". In comparison, \\"The battle rages on\\" falls flat since many of the songs are at best forgettable, with exception of the title track: \\"The battle rages on\\" and \\"Anya\\". Maybe the blues-boogie inspired \\"Ramshackle man\\" and the slower \\"Solitaire\\" are above average but there's too many fillers on this one.
6300214435|4.0|Since it OBVIOUSLY wasn't directed by Spielberg, credits or no. This film was everything the first Indy movie claimed to be and wasn't: A rollicking, enjoyable, edge-of-your-seat matinee movie with thrill-a-minute action, funny situations and good character interplay.<br />This is a prequel to \\"Raiders\\" which finds Indy wearing his glasses for only about five minutes of the story. It starts OUT as an adventure, rather than leads up to one.<br />The film opens in a Chinese lounge where Indy is to meet up with a wealthy Chinese merchant after completing an assignment for him to obtain the remains of the first emperor of the Manchu dynasty. Indy enters the movie very James Bond-like, coming down a sprial staircase to the table where the merchant, Lao Che, has just finished watching a floor show by Willie, played by Spielberg's present golddigger wife, Kate Capshaw, and her girls.<br />The double cross starts almost immeidately as Lao Che tries to poison Indy to keep from paying him with a VERY large diamond for his troubles. Indy gets desperate, as it's revealed that Lao Che ALSO possesses the ANTIDOTE for the poison, to be given when he turns over the diamond. To try to force Lao Che to give up the antidote, Jones does something very unheroic by threatening to disembowel Willie if he doesn't turn it over, holding an olive fork to her side.<br />What follows is pure chaos as Lao Che reveals that his sons have a bead on him, assuring Indy's cooperation. HOWEVER, Indy knew his client well enough to be prepared with his OWN backup gunsel, disguised as a waiter in the club. Immediately after this, somebody pops a champagne cork, causing some antsy soul to fire a gun, killing Indy's friend, etc., etc. until the room is awash in fistfights and bullets. Indy takes Willie, escapes from the club behind a rolling gong he cuts down to protect them from the gunplay, leaps out the window of the club \\"Obi Wan\\", and the adventure in under way in earnest, as Indy's \\"tween\\" Korean sidekick, Short Round, is introduced as the driver of his getaway car.<br />The three end up making tracks out of China, (or is it Hong Kong?) via a plane, which, ironically enough, is OWNED by Lao Che, unbeknownst to Indy and his friends.<br />To give away more will blunt your enjoyment of this movie, which indeed takes you on a ride from the very start. It's obvious that Lucas directed this film in pretty much the same way Spielberg directed/influenced \\"Poltergeist\\" and \\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\" (the latter a near DOUBLE to IJATTOD in plotline and main character allotment.) Indy is, in fact, a Lucas creation, in collaboration with Philip Kauffman, and BOTH of these guys can direct rings around Spielberg!<br />The clues are obvious: just like Star wars, \\"Temple of Doom\\" has a taller, older hero, a younger hero, a spunky love interest that initially HATES the older hero then grows fond of him, with all of them threatened by a VERY evil cult/organization in a quasi-mystical setting. Spielberg xeroxed this formula in \\"Young Sherlock Holmes\\", which he produced, and which Barry Levinson is credited with directing.<br />Just remember, if, like me, you CRINGE at the thought of any movie directed by Steven Spielbucks, that in THIS movie, he was little more than the hand puppet Lucas used to tell the actors where to stand. ILM pretty much handled the rest of the film...idekick, Short Round, is introduced as the driver of his getaway car. <br />The three end up making tracks out of China, (or is it Hong Kong?) via a plane, which, ironically enough, is OWNED by Lao Che, unbeknownst to Indy and his friends.<br />To give away more will blunt your enjoyment of this movie, which indeed takes you on a ride from the very start.

B000002UAC|2.0|This is OK, with a mix of originals and covers.  If you want to hear what the world heard with the introduction to the Beatles you need to get this.  Samplers like &quot;Beatles 1&quot; don't give that flavor.<br />But don't get carried away.  The Beatles are OK, but they were pioneers of rock only until about 1964, then started to get off track with Rubber Soul.  2-stars.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Whoa! This movie is awesome. Nightcrawler was great and Jackman played Wolverine perfectly again. If your an X-men freak and read the comics pay close attention to the little things in this movie. For example: When Mystique is on the computer getting Stryker's data look closely at the files and names on the computer. Some of them are Remy Lebeau, Garrison Kane, Jamie Madrox, Franklin Richards and more. In the bar scene with the security guard look closely at the TV and you'll see a small appearance of Hank McCoy. I think the third movie is going to feature Pheonix and if you read the comics and watch this movie you'll know why. All in all a great movie. Go see it.
055357342X|5.0|You will experience a broad range of emotions when you read this book.  I did the same thing one of the other people who reviewed this book did when he threw it down in anger.  But that only compels you to read on, because you know the good guys have to win sometime.  The thing I liked best about this book was the introduction of the supernatural.  It doesn't drown you in it like Goodkind and Jordan do, but it does add another level to the series.  All in all this is one of the best written books I have read.  The only negative thing I can say is that I get tired of Martin killing off the characters we grow close to.
B000000IV0|5.0|Since the begining of the rock genre there has never been a bigger album than Nirvana's Nevermind. From start to finish it is heavy, melodic and inventive. Nirvana sound fantastic as individuals and as a group, from Dave Grohl's (now in foo fighters) incredibly good drumming (especially in Teen Spirit), Chris Novoselic's bass playing (best in lounge act) to the incredible talent of the now legendary Kurt Cobain, even 9 years after his death(he died on 04/04/94) he is still renowned to be the man that made rock popular again. <BR>The first track is by far the most famous rock song ever written, \\"Smells like teen spirit\\" has a ludicrously catchy chorus with a melodic intersection and a nice solo toward the end. The other singles such as \\"Come as you are\\" with its amazing base line and clever lyrics show another side to Nirvana as does \\"Polly\\" and \\"something in the way\\". <BR>Whereas Breed comes into its own with its fast pased riffs and catchy chorus. Other not so well known songs (which happen to be fantastic tracks) like \\"lounge act\\", \\"stay away\\" and \\"territorial pissings\\" are also essential with their fast pace and catchy chorus's. <BR>My personal favourite tracks are \\"Teen Spirit\\", \\"Breed\\", \\"Territorial Pissings\\", \\"Drain You\\", Lounge act, \\"Stay away\\",\\"Lithium\\" and \\"On a Plain\\". As you can tell i prefer the faster pased songs, although i do appreciate the softer songs like \\"polly\\" and \\"something in the way\\". My personal favourites add up to 8 songs on a 12 song cd. They are just my real favourites i still love \\"come as you are\\" and \\"In Bloom\\" but from the amount of times that ive heard them they just sound like filler tracks even though they are actually singles.<BR>The singles off the album are <BR>Teen Spirit<BR>In Bloom<BR>Come as you are<BR>Lithium.<BR>Hopefully this will change any bodies mind on this album because it is fantastic and it is yet to be beaten, although Linkin Park are close.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|All my life I was under the misconception that country music [stunk] and the people who sang it had no taste whatsoever in REAL music. That it was a genre aimed soley at redneck southern trailer folk. This album smacks me in the face and shows that I'm an idiot for my prejudices.<br />Trent Rezor's \\"HURT\\" is a beautifully sad song about a person who has lost everything and everyone dear to him. And Cash does an excellent rendition.<br />I never expected Johnny Cash to be an ...fan. Or for him to even have a copy of Downward Spiral in his cd collection. He's got hella guts covering these songs and selling them to his fans. It could make or break him. I think this album will break some barriers. I know its a pretty small chance in the eyes of some..But I think it will cause both goth fans and country folk to give a chance to music genres they would never think of touching before. This album is great. It shows that country can be just as despaired and emotional as goth.<br />I wonder if Michale Trent Reznor is a fan of Johnny Cash?? Perhaps Reznor will cover some Cash tunes???<br />-Chris<BR>(BlazeFoxKitsune =^.^= )<BR>LONG LIVE ...
B000002LIX|4.0|A good record.  People don't understand that all of the songs on this record had been written before Nothing Shocking was ever released, except for the last two songs. I wish they written new material after the release date of the Nothing Shocking,it could have been great!!!
B00008NG5V|5.0|frankly, words don't do justice...<BR>I liked Brushfire, but i cannot get over what an incredibly RICH album On and On is! I cannot take this album out of my cd player: at home, in the car, at work, back in the car, and finally at home again. you get the point.<br />those who don't see the genius in Jack's soulful simplicity are missing the point. sure, at first, one might think &quot;geez, it's all a bunch of somewhat repetitive chords and basic rhythm structures.&quot; well, my advice is that give the lyrics, beats, and melodies a very close listen - a collection of textures and moods that conveyed so beautifully, they'll move. This is one diverse and talented assembly of musicians. These songs are the raw and genuine goods - no additives. There's a time and place for the hoochie-mamma bump-n-grind Miller commercials, this sure ain't it. Amen. this album will remind you what is born of true human thought and talent.<BR>Please, do yourself a favor and buy this album - then, sit and take in the smoothness of this hawaiian bruddah. pure rapture. Thank you sooo much Jack Johnson for this wonderful gift. You've earned yourself a lifetime of good swells on whichever beach you happen to be surfing. Ikaika brah!
0273659030|2.0|My advice is: avoid this book. Although it has certain usefulness, it can actually undermine your ability to think and write effectively.<br />1. As the reader from Los Angeles pointed out, the whole book is based on the premise that &quot;the mind automatically sorts information into...pyramidal groupings&quot; and that information &quot;is easier to comprehend if it arrives presorted into its pyramid.&quot; However, the author didn't give any scientific evidence to support this claim. With some reading in the cognitive science field, my understanding is (more knowledgeable readers can correct me on this), how our mind works is so complicated that no one has actually figured it out. I will be surprised to see any cognitive scientist will assert that the only way our mind works with information is to automatically sort them into pyramidal groups. My personal experience is, sometimes we do, sometimes we don't and sometimes we just can't. When you force issues into pyramidal groupings when you shouldn't, the result can be non-effective and confusing. I think the fact that this book itself is hard to comprehend and its principle is difficult to apply, is a result of the author's artificial pyramidal grouping.<br />2. Even though pyramidal grouping can work well in some circumstances, the author's attempt to make it an all-comprehending principle forced her to make endless amendment in circumstances its usefulness is questionable. The end result is unnecessary complication of its application. This makes the book far less useful and practical than a basic writing or logic book.<br />3. Even if the premise of pyramidal grouping is true, even if you can actually apply the principle, it will not necessarily make you an effective communicator. As an owner of a small consulting firm, my experience is that, having your ideas UNDERSTOOD is a totally different thing from having your ideas ACCEPTED. You can make your case perfectly logic and clear, but that dose not necessarily mean people will interested in or accept it. The only way to effectively communicate with other people, is to actively engage their interests, speak/write from their pre-knowledge and perception. That means sometimes you will have to purposefully speak/write in a non-pyramidal way even when the issues can be perfectly organized into pyramidal groupings.<br />Given the high ranking this book gets on this site, many people will certainly disagree with my review. However, I challenge those who gave this book high marks to enlist their ACTUAL improvements, such as more constructive ideas generated, higher acceptance rates of their work, etc, by actually USING this principle, and benchmark these results against those achieved by reading basic writing and logic advice book.<br />That said, if you are reading this book in order to get ideas to improve your consulting practice, as I was, this book can be insightful if you look into WHY this whole &quot;pyramidal grouping&quot; thing can be so popular and get such high ranking. My feeling is, with its broad promise, seemingly logical and useful advice, occasional usefulness, it's kind like anti-impotent pill for the paralyzing intellectual problem of how to think and write effectively. I surely wish I could have been the author of such a pill. Geez, the reason I wrote such a length, negative review can well because I'm jealous.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Just a few years after its release, it's hard to believe that Episode 1 was the most highly anticipated movie event of the twentieth century. Like Christmas morning, it turned out that the aching anticipation and season's spirit were far more affective than the event itself. And just as we don't recall right off what we got last Christmas morning, Star Wars Episode 1 isn't mentioned when we sit around with friends and talk about our Favorite Movies Ever. But camping out at the theater that summer--yeah, that was awesome.<br />Episode 1 was a colossal disappointment, and not just because of Jar Jar Binks. If that were the only reason, Episode 2 would have been great--instead of just its special effects. Some reasons why Episode 1 was terrible (let's hope George Lucas reads this):<br />1. No central villain. It should have been Darth Maul. Remember him? And he wasn't even cloned in the sequel... What we got for protagonists was a couple of alien viceroys with the most ridiculous b-movie Japanese accents. Ugh<br />2. Stupid plot that was mostly politics. Trade federations, senators, political manuevers, blah. How can you screw up a story about Jedi knights rescuing and protecting a queen, while coming across a Jedi prodigy being held as a slave? How can you ruin such a great premise? ANYONE could have written that plot better than how it was done.<br />3. A cardinal rule of movie-making: don't have children do drama. The last thing we want to see is a little boy doing a Marlon Brando role. <br />4. The characters we loved most--Obi Wan, Darth Maul, Qui Gonn--had smaller roles next to the teen queen, little boy, Jar Jar, and viceroys. And Yoda wasn't very wise.<br />5. Is meesa forgetting anything else? Exqueeze me.<br />Pretty special effects are no substitute for a ruined story and uninteresting characters. It's difficult to say, though, which is the worse Anakin: little boy or whiny teen. I don't think I'll be the only one to say, \\"Thank you lord,\\" when he finally puts on the black cape and kills Mace Windu. And hopefully Padme too. <BR>   But my hopes are higher for Episode 3. The way I see it is this: Episode 1 appealed most to 12-year olds, Episode 2 was for 15-year olds; if this is a pattern, Episode 3 will be for the crowd of 18 years. And that's not so bad. Right there with every other special effects action movie.
B000002HRE|2.0|Ok....i have Been A Hardcore Metallica fan since 1987.Everything that they have released Ive liked, Even Load.I tried my hardest to like this album but just couldnt.I forced Myself to listen to it Hoping it would grow on me...but it just didnt.Although the album has 4 good songs on it they are &quot;Unforgiven 2&quot;,&quot;Low Mans Lyric&quot;,&quot;Fuel&quot; and what I consider the best track on the album&quot;Fixxer&quot;It just doesnt hold up to there past albums,Its like this is the album they put together from stuff thaT  they had thrown away in the black album and load sessions.Dont get me wrong though...I still have Much respect for Metallica and I support them Not matter what they did.Im Looking forward to there next Album &quot;St.Anger&quot;.
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a great story detailing important childhood events from the point of view of Jean Louise Finch(aka Scout). Jean is a little girl who lives with her older brother of 5 years, Jeremy Finch(aka Jem) and her father Atticus Finch in a little town in Maycomb county. The novel's main theme is basically the lessons one learns growing up. This theme is centered a lot around the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, of supposedly raping a white woman. Atticus is the lawyer given the job of defending Robinson and with this heated trial occurring, Scout and Jem have to deal with a lot of oppossition and derision from many of their prejudiced neighbors. But, this story has so much more dealing with just the general complexities of growing up. <br />I think my favorite thing about the novel was the characters. The Finch family comes across as easily liked people. Scout and Jem have a great relationship with their father and with each other. Also, I really liked the character of Atticus, as he comes across as a man you can really respect and admire. It's through him that the reader, along with Scout and Jem, come to learn some lessons in a sense as well. Of course, there are plenty of interesting secondary characters such as Boo Radley who Scout and Jem constantly try to lure from his reclusion in his home and Calpurnia, the woman who's like a mother to Scout and Jem. <br />I'd say this book may get off to somewhat of a slow start and for the first few pages, you may not understand how this is considered to be a classic, but it's a great book as you progress through it and it tells a very simple, yet wonderful story. If you're interested in reading it, go ahead and get it as you'll probably really like it.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is Metallicas Best,Most Aggressive and In your face Album to Date.Its packed with riffs unlike anyone has done before(back in 1988)The Music Is Timeless.If your Just now becoming a fan of Metallica and you have yet to buy this Album....I Strongly Recommend this one before any other.
B00006690G|5.0|While both Slim Shady and Marshall Mathers are an important part of this CD, Eminem subsumes his two other personas to take center stage on The Eminem Show.  While the album is not as consistently impressive as either of his first two albums, it contains some standout tracks and displays a unity of purpose and theme that marks Eminem as a more mature and talented artist more than comfortable in his own often-criticized skin.  There is plenty of violence and cursing throughout the course of this exceedingly long release (coming in at over an hour and seventeen minutes), yet a softer and certainly more introspective Eminem sometimes reveals himself in the lyrics.  While there is plenty of talk about his own life, it is now somewhat counterbalanced by criticism of the music industry, censorship, and even American policy (including, as everyone probably knows, some harsh words for Lynn Cheney and Tipper Gore).  This doesn't make Eminem a global spokesman for anything, but it certainly seems he is trying to place his music in a larger context.  Naturally, though, his most intense lyrics revolve around his own life, the penultimate example of which is Cleaning Out My Closet.  In this self-revelatory track, Eminem launches a vicious attack on his mother, seemingly holding nothing back at all in his diatribe.  He raises the specter of his ex-wife Kim in The Kiss skit, but there is no equivalent track to Bonnie and Clyde 97 or Kim on this album.<br /><br />Eminem doesn't take himself too seriously, leading to tracks such My Dad's Gone Crazy, the brilliant and funny duo with his daughter Hailie Jade.  Hailie's influence is felt most strongly, of course, on Hailey's Song.  This is by far my favorite song on this album, and it is certainly unique in that Eminem actually sings the lyrics, reflecting the obvious joy he feels at getting his daughter back.  There are certainly enough tracks reflecting the rage and youthful exasperation that have always driven Eminem, but there is also a measure of fun rarely felt in his earlier efforts.  Without Me is loads of fun, forever conjuring up images in my mind of Eminem in that superhero getup from the video.  In White America, Eminem seems to take delight in pondering the effects he has on young people; and I find a lot of entertainment values in Square Dance.  The only song I don't really care for is Drips featuring Obie Trice, a song that seems to take shock value for its own sake a little too far for my tastes.  Overall, though, The Eminem Show is yet another amazing album from the unstoppable force known as Eminem, and the maturity, commitment, and ever-increasing skills revealed in its conception and execution offer undeniable proof that hip hop's most controversial and influential star is going to be a force in the business for a very long time.measure of fun rarely felt in his earlier efforts.

B00005QFE5|5.0|I have never sobbed like this in the movies. This movie is simple and touching.
B000002VCQ|5.0|Given the disappointing commercial performance of her latest album, \\"Just Whitney\\", which has done so poorly by Whitney Houston standards she's had to seek out shoddy acting roles on Network TV (I.E Boston Public), I thought I'd revisit her debut album and share my thoughts.<br />\\"You give good love\\" is sentimental with a superb chorus.<br />The keyboard driven \\"Thinking about you\\" is pleasant, I'm not sure who supplies the extra vocals, the liner notes don't give credit. The up-beat, funk influenced \\"Someone for me\\" has a bounce feel to it. Both these songs are unheralded gems in the Houston catalog. \\"Saving all my love for you\\" is a great winding ballad that grabbed a full decade of constant airplay. Only today has it lost it's muster, but I fault programmers for that.<br />Mega-Hit \\"How will I know\\" is 4-and-a-half minutes of pure delight. It's built around a prominent synth-line and an engaging bass. A guitar and saxophone section show up as well. The lyrics are typical fare, about her fretting over if a guy shows interest. A few critics have complained the video was cheesy. So Shoot me, I liked it!<br />Most of the remainder of Side-B consists of ballads. If you're familiar with these songs and never cared for 'em, my review won't make you a fan. <br />\\"All at once\\" has a nice, rhyming pre-chorus.The song's about loneliness, and the time away in a relationship hurts the main character. \\"Take good care of my heart\\" is an exceptional duet with Jermaine Jackson.<br />Now onto the massively successful \\"The greatest love of all\\". Te opening keyboards set the mood, sedgewaying into Whitney's one-of-a-kind voice. And in response to the detractors saying \\"She oversings' excuse me, but when you have pipes like that, you've earned the right!<br />\\"Hold Me\\" closes the album in fine fashion. It's a duet with Teddy Pendergrass, whose low-pitched Vocal timbre provides the perfect compliment to Whitney's.<br />To date \\"Whitney Houston\\" has sold 15 Million copies in the UnitedStates alone and is arguably more of a career high point than the \\"Bodyguard\\" soundtrack. Especially when you consider that was a compilation, not her album.
0380977788|2.0|This was by far the most bizarre book I've ever read. I began reading it, expecting a dark fantasy similar to Garth Nix's work. I was obviously mistaken. What I really ended up reading was what could be passed off as a Garth Nix crack-smoking fantasy. It made very little sense, and in some places made no sense at all. It reminded me of the strangeness of Alice in Wonderland. Usually I keep an open mind about different styles of writing, but this was just plain weird. Many reviews said this book is frightening, so I expected to get some thrills and chills out of reading it. Neil Gaiman tries very hard to freak me out, but does not succeed. The most chilling part of the entire book was the illustrations, which were disturbingly creepy. By the time I finished reading the book, I closed it wondering what, exactly, had just happened.
B00008NRI8|4.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are great together in this light commedy.  There are times when you can tell that this movie was written by the person responsible for &quot;Miss Congeniality&quot;, but Two Weeks Notice is not as laugh-out-loud funny.  Nothing here is new, and neither of the stars is stretching to play these roles.  But, that's probably what I liked about it.  I go to movies with these people in them to see them play fun and loveable characters. The DVD extra &quot;two bleeps notice&quot; is disappointing.  I don't like having to watch the whole movie again just to see the outtakes.  It is a good  thing to have as an option (since the outtakes are then put into context), but not as the only way to see the clips.  If you enjoy romantic comedies, this is great to watch. Personally, I love this movie.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Forget all the critics' reviews who panned the album I don't think they even actually listent to the album.  The single American Life is interesting but easily one of the weakest tracks here and coupled with the negative publicity of it being an anti-war song, not the best lead single. Every track here are excellent esp. LOVE PROFUSION, NOTHING FAILS, INTERVENTION, X-STATIC PROCESS, MOTHER AND FATHER.  Like LIKE A PRAYER, the album gets better with further listening and grows on you, Perhaps the critics expect another major breakthrough by Madonna and were taken aback by the simplicity in the production here. Or, they could be pro-war too and are henced biased in their reviews.<br />Yet the simplicity of the album reminds one of her earlier effort, Like a Prayer. This album boasts of strong song writing, immaculate production and good lyrics. Like Erotica, this album is ahead of its time, and as &quot;Hollywood&quot; sings - &quot;DJs are always playing the same songs on the radio&quot;, but not this album. The unfortunate backlash by pro-war Americans led to the poor radio -plays of American Life by radio DJs who avoided it; thus leading to poor charting of the single. <br />Still, for one who's on the scene for 20 years and continues to produce good music ahead of its time, Madonna will become the best real artist of our time, and this album will become one of her classic albums of all time. An excellent album through and through.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I am exhausted of blatant Matrix-style plagiarism.  So, when I saw Equilibrium on the shelf and saw the gritty, black-on-black dressed actors scowling at me from under the plastic wrap, I was on my way out of the shop. A fellow consumer heard me scoff at the movie and suggested that I buy it and then judge for myself. He was right.<BR>   Equilibrium takes you to a post WW3 world where all the inhabitants of \\"Libria\\" (very much resembling a rebuilt NYC) are taking a drug to numb their ability to feel. The human qualities of sense and emotion are what allegedly caused the third World War, and consequently the requirement for a sedated populace.  To counter the threat of rebels refusing the drug and enjoying the innocuous libations of music, art, and film, the governing body (Father) has created an elite task force to punish the guilty.  This is done via two teams; the all-purpose foot soldiers dressed in class III armor and sporting high-end Austrian/German assault rifles, and Clerics.  Clerics are the most revolutionary characters in an action movie to date.  Clinically unattached to their fellow human beings, they can infiltrate a room full of armed criminals, and dispatch them with automatic Beretta pistols.<BR>What can I say about the action? It's like nothing you've ever seen.  There's no bullet time.  No Yuen wo Ping coordinating wire-fu.  No idiotic diatribes involving obligatory philosophy, and certainly no Keanu-come-lately pondering whether or not he is the one.  This movie shares no modicum with Wachowski storytelling or Gaeta vision.  It's plausible that some technology was incorporated to garner the visuals, but this movie is quite original in it's implementation of those tools.<BR>  Can I tell you that I loved this movie? Yes, and I think of myself as a very critical, jaded movie guy.  I've come to expect a better usage of the technology given movie makers since 1999, and I can tell you honestly that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It does start with acrash and a bang, but the faithful watcher will be rewarded with a refreshing concept and awesome action.
B000065V1V|5.0|What a great album.  When you want the best there is no other place to go than David Bowie.  He has done it again, with a strong and diverse album.  Never underestimate the brillance of Bowie.  Heathen, just goes to show how Bowie sumerges himself in his music.  I haven't been able to put it down from the first listen.  This comes hight recommended from me and everyone I know.  If you liked Earthling then you will love Heathen.
B00006M183|5.0|The greatest rock band of the 90's delivers the goods with this album.  I give it 5 stars because it's right up there with Ten.  It's definitely a step up from No Code and Yield, as Pearl Jam shows it's true colors in &quot;Save You&quot;, &quot;Green Disease&quot;, and &quot;I Am Mine&quot;.  These 3 songs define this band as they have come full circle within the last 10 years.  It just goes to show all the critics that if a rock band is truely one of the greatest, they can still put out GREAT material 10+ years after their debut album.  To anyone who says Pearl Jam needs to give it up, go pick up this album.  It's Eddie and the guys at their best. <br />Maybe the best song on the album, &quot;thumbing My Way&quot;, isn't a traditional hard-rocker, but it gives the album a complete feel.  The opening chords of this song when Eddie sings &quot;I have not been home since you left long ago...&quot; puts you off in a different place, as you can feel his mood through his voice.  The pace goes back up to the Pearl Jam level that we all know, in songs like &quot;Can't Keep&quot; and &quot;Get Right&quot;.  And even the controversial &quot;Bushleaguer&quot; adds a refreshing flavor to an already unbelievable album.<br />Pearl Jam no doubt knows how to keep their fans wanting more.  Thanks guys, for everything you've done for this business, and for giving the people albums like Riot Act.  And if you haven't seen them live, you're really missing out on a killer show.
6305949980|5.0|I'll say it again, this movie is stunning.  Danny Elfman's music (and vocal) is brilliant, the models are fabulous, the story delightful.<br />Although I was nervous about showing it to my five year old kids (the bits with Mr Oogy Boogey coming apart, in particular), they loved it.<br />This is a must-see movie.
B000056N8X|2.0|The Highlander series has always been catered to the fans, but even to them, this is as confusing as movies get.  I'm hardly a follower of the series, but I have seen the movies (been a while since parts 2 and 3, memories of which don't serve me well at all) but I get the feeling watch those two wouldn't have made this any more comprehensible.  As a matter of fact, doesn't each movie negate the one that came before it?  <br />So what we have here is a tale of two immortals, Connor and Duncan MacLeod (Christopher Lambert and Adrian Paul), who apparently are out to stop an even more powerful and evil immortal (Bruce Payne) who holds a grudge against Connor.  That's the basic premise, but getting into details would only be confusing, to me and whoever's reading this.<br />There are a LOT of subplots at work here, individual scenes that don't really seem to mesh with the main story, and if they do, they're never concluded satisfactorily.  Example?  How about when Connor is kept locked in a room with an iron mask covering his eyes; how exactly did he end up there and how did he even escape?  What about those people who keep track of the immortal kills; who are they, how do they do it, and considering there are tons of rules these immortals have to follow in combat, how come these people never enforce the rules?  For that matter, considering the evil Kell (the film's villain) isn't even following these rules, why shouldn't Connor and Duncan team up to take him down?<br />Those are only a few of the movie's numerous head-scratchers, suffice to say if this is the first and only Highlander movie you've seen, don't worry, I'm as every bit as confused as you are.  The series never follows a singular mythology, which simply means if you watch the first film, each of the individual sequels plays as a follow-up to that film, and certainly not the one that came before it (i.e. part 2 sort of follows part 1, part 3 negates part 2 and follows part 1, part 4 negates part 3 and follows up to part 1).<br />But even that rule isn't completely sound.  Even Highlander: The Quickening chose to negate much of what occurred in the first film, done in such blatant manners that you can't help but slap your forehead when you witness what a true mess this series became.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about; Connor and Ramirez are really from another planet called Zeist and they've known each other from then (which makes their \\"first\\" meeting in Scotland in the original film a headscratcher).  I haven't even gotten to the fact that all these immortals are fighting to return to Zeist, even though they were banished there for being rebels (doesn't this mean they should all, I dunno, work together?)  According to the Renegade version, immortals are from the past, which is still almost as mucked up. <br />But I digress, the point here is to review Endgame, and for what it is, it might please Highlander fans, if they prefer Paul to Lambert, as the former is the true star of the picture, and is highlighted in most of the action sequences.  The action itself is relatively decent, the climactic swordfight could have been better filmed, but it's not like I was expecting a lot from the action in this movie in the first place.<br />When it comes to the series, I'm a casual open-minded viewer and what keeps me coming to each sequel is the hope that finally, someone will capitalize with the grand ideas at work.  Instead, this quartet is mostly viewed as an embarrassment to sci-fi/fantasy/action filmmaking, an insult to lucid storytelling, and a spit in the face to those who enjoyed the first movie.  I didn't absolutely hate Endgame, it's had enough watchable moments to keep my attention, but it's definitely a bad movie, and doesn't have the awe-inspiring kitsch value of The Quickening.<br />I have one more thing to complain about and that's the amount of effort put into marketing this picture.  Obviously, Dimension films wanted to milk the series for allit was worth, but they actually gave us trailers that featured cool scenes that were never even meant to be in the film.  Alternately, when we have a great sci-fi action film like Equilibrium left to die at the box office, I'm only further upset at what Dimension believes is or isn't worth marketing.   <BR>[one half out of five stars].
0375432302|2.0|(Its a fascinating exercise, looking up books that you love (which this one isn't), and reading the reviews sorted Lowest first.  Try it sometimes...)<br />I have to admit, I bought and read this book largely in spite of all the low ratings and accusations of anti-christian sentiment.  I'm a bit of a puzzle-nut, and I thought this might be an interesting read, despite the reviews.<br />I agree with many that its not a fabulous work of literature, to live on for years, and I doubt that Dan Brown intended it to be.  If he did, well, that a different story, and has nothing to do with a review of this book.<br />I agree that its certainly going to ruffle the feathers of people who don't actually have faith in their faith, so to speak.  Heck, I had no problem with \\"The Branch\\" by Mike Resnick, \\"Behold the Man\\" by Michael Moorcock, pretty much everything by James Morrow.  But I recognise that those things, like this book, are stories.  Not truth.  Not something to live your life by.  Stories.<br />Actually, I don't see anywhere in this novel where Brown suggests Christ didn't die on the cross, and *thats* the fundamental tenet of Christianity, that God became man, and died for your sins.<br />Whilst I don't believe it happened the way Brown describes it, I don't have a problem believing that Christ did all the things that normal men did.  That was the point - he was a man.  Son of God, but man.<br />I do sometimes wonder at why we place blind faith in some books, and distruct others, especially given the whole \\"eye of a needle\\" thing (look it up sometime).  Translation is such a tough topic, and requires so much context, that you wonder how any of these things survived the illiteracy of the past.  Did you know that \\"boy\\" used to mean \\"a child of either gender\\" ?  Thats how the Greeks used it, at least thats what I've read. Imagine the historical documents you might need to rethink taking that into account...<br />Another thing other reviewers focus on are the supposed attacks on the Church, and Opus Dei in particular.  Did any of them actually read to the end of the book where its revealed that \\"surprise, as institutions, they weren't involved in this after all\\" ?<br />I think its probably *not* a good book to recommend to people coming to grips with Christianity, nor is it one to pass blindly to teenagers without making quite clear to them that its fiction, not fact, not based-on-fact.  In fact, I doubt I'd recommend it to anyone unless they asked about it.  (ie, don't read it because I gave it 2 stars, read it because you think you might enjoy it)<br />My main objection to the book is the fundamental premise that there is a secret society that has had,and kept, a secret for hundreds of years, and yet there are all these \\"cryptic crossword clues\\" left lying around the world pointing at the secret, in such a trivial fashion.  And so simplistically...<br />For example, ask yourself why the scroll saying \\"The trail stops here\\" deliberately put its guardian in danger.  Why didn't it say \\"go dig up the underground\\" - the guardian would still see the clue being exhumed, but would be in no danger whatsoever when she gave the signal.<br />When push came to shove, the conspirators just weren't that convincing.

B00005JLWN|5.0|P>Equilibrium features a terrific premise: the film is set sometime after WWIII (the year is unspecified) in a city called Libria, which is headed by a man called \\"Father\\" (Sean Pertwee), who only appears to the citizens via hologram.  All citizens are required to take a daily dose of prozium, a drug that dulls the emotions, which is what's believed to be the source of man's inhumanity to man.  To ensure people continue their dosage, examples are made by law enforcers called clerics.  These clerics are warrirors trained in a unique style called gun-kata, which teaches the fighter to stand in the position where they're least likely to be hit by enemy fire and to use a gun as an extension of the fighter itself.  In the opening scene, we see how such a concept works.<br />But similar to Logan's Run, our hero, cleric John Preston (Christian Bale), comes through an awakening when he misses his dose.  He experiences emotions for the first time and finds himself conflicted with everything he'd believed in and fought for and what he now believes is the right thing to do.  He wants to contact and join the rebel forces against \\"Father,\\" but finds this isn't an easy task, especially with his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), watching his every move and a massive army backing \\"Father.\\"<br />Equilibrium is a film that can be viewed as thought-provoking entertainment.  Writer/director Kurt Wimmer conveys this emotionless world with great attention to minute details (I never noticed the cars were entirely white, even inside, until my second viewing), incredible sets and production values that display the sterile feel of the environment.  Whoever constructed the sets should be applauded, especially considering the modest budget the film had to work with.  The  look and feel of this city, along with Preston's erupting emotions, are nicely backed by Klaus Badelt's brooding score.<br />Simultaneously, the film has an utterly fabulous story, engrossing in its ability to convince you ofthis terrifying future and take you along for the ride beside our protagonist.  Are there plot holes?  Yes, but none that couldn't be reasonably explained, which means they're closer to being contrivances.  For instance, the soldiers Preston face obviously display some fear, but I think prozium is only a suppressant; it doesn't completely rid the person of emotions.  Plus, when someone has a shotgun pointed straight at his face, it'd be pretty difficult not to show some concern.<br />Much of what makes Equilibrium's story so suspenseful is it's unpredictability; Wimmer is so skillful in his delivery that it isn't until the conclusion we figure out the surprises and it's revealed who truly has the upper hand in this constantly twisting plot (possible spoiler: I will say this, I am quite glad the villains didn't turn out as dumb as they may have initially seemed).<br />Equilibrium's future claim to fame will be the gun-kata sequences, which are, for lack of a better word, breathtaking.  There are other terms I could use; innovative, exhilarating, exciting, thrilling, heart-pounding, but I think breathtaking most accurately captures the complete surprise and delight I felt while watching the film (on the big screen, no less).  There are five sequences that display gun-kata (along with two \\"ordinary\\" gun battles, a well-done sparring sequence, and some terrific swordplay), and each setpiece almost always tops the one that came before it in both innovation and excitment.  I hesitate to go further, as I feel your enjoyment will be heightened if you don't know exactly how the action plays out (suffice to say the one-on-one jaw-dropping climactic duel is, bar none, the best fight scene I've seen all decade long).  <br />Of course, as with almost all thrillers, action sequence only take up a minor portion of the running time (in this case, about twenty minutes in all, still a hefty amount, with a large portion of that in the climax).  So what keeps our attention to the screen isn't just the story, the stylish cinematography and production design, but also the performances.  At the center of the story is Christian Bale, an always superb actor who delivers one of his best performances as Preston.  This immensely difficult role is made entirely believable and moving by Bale, whose captivating turn ensures we have a rooting interest from beginning to end.<br />Taye Diggs doesn't get the opportunity to shine nearly as much as Bale, but is solid as Brandt, though his constant smiling has been a source of complaint.  (spoiler) By the end of the film, it's still questionable whether or not he was taking prozium. He is Dupont's underling, which suggests he, too, might not have been taking his prozium.  Emily Watson is good, though underused, as Mary O'Brien, a woman Preston takes interest in.  William Fichtner has an intriguing role as a somewhat mysterious but passionate rebel leader and Angus Mcfadyen is suitably chilling as the head cleric Dupont.<br />Equilibrium's action sequences have raised the bar for future competition, and not even the just released The Matrix Reloaded can compete (not that their action is similar) with what Wimmer has crafted.  But just as important, the movie engages our mind, our emotions, and pulls us through all 107 minutes without a hiccup in pacing or momentum.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Considering the proliferation of films based on comic book heroes (and anti-heroes) in recent years, it's hard to recall that this 1978 adaptation of the Superman comic strip and icon of Americana was a monumental gamble for the producers, the director, and its distributor, Warner Bros.  The last major DC comic book character to hit the silver screen had been Batman, in 1966, but that movie -- although fun to watch -- had the same campy approach to the Caped Crusader that the then-current TV series on ABC had.  Warner Bros., which owned DC Comics and the rights to Superman, feared that a campy Superman film would flop.  So for years, the idea lingered in limbo. Indeed, had it not been for the vision of Alexander and Ilya Salkind, Warner Bros. might never had made Superman: The Movie at all.<br />But the story of how Superman made it to the big screen is not for this reviewer to tell...although it is available in this wonderful DVDs extra features as part of the behind-the-scenes documentaries on the flip side of the single disc.<br />What I can say about this Superman DVD is that of the four movies in the series, this first one is the best.  Yes, the special effects are a bit dated by our CGI-dominated 2003 standards, but for the late 1970s these mostly hand-crafted visuals were eye-popping and wow-inducing.  But effects alone do not make a good movie; Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman's smart, fast-paced script, Richard Donner's steady direction, Geoffrey Unsworth's fine cinematography, and John Williams' wonderful score combine with great visuals and interesting performances by such cast members as Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, and Christopher Reeve. (I can't say enough about Reeve's acting: in essence, he plays Clark Kent very differently from Kal-El/Superman.)<br />This DVD (which was released almost 2 years ago) presents Superman: The Movie in its full widescreen glory and with a crisp and clear transfer from film to digital.  The movie itself is about eight minutes longer than the theatrical or VHS versions; the studio allowed Donner to restore material cut from the 1978 release version (but later seen on its ABC TV presentation).  I personally don't know if that was really necessary, but I don't object violently to it, either.  The sound quality is good, although since I don't have a home theater type sound system I can't claim to be an expert on the quality of Dolby Surround or stuff like that. It sounds good on my TV, that's all I can say for that aspect of the DVD.<br />The extra features are also good. While the audio commentary is not as focused on technology used in the shooting of the movie, Richard Donner and creative consultant Tom Mankeweicz do provide some fascinating insights into the movie and its cast.  Furthermore, they have good speaking voices and never bore you to death.  Another nifty feature (for John Williams fans) is a music-only track that allows you to watch this movie as a two-hour-plus music video.  The other extra features -- documentaries, screen tests, trailers, and additional music cues -- are on the B side of the disc.<br />My only complaint is Warner Home Video's mostly-cardboard DVD cases and the double-sided DVD....one has to handle both with extra gentle care to avoid damaging either the package or the DVD.<br />One additional note: The only other Superman movie (until the 21st Century feature is made and released) worth buying is Superman II.  It is one of the few sequels of a good movie worth seeing, and this is in part because it was being made simultaneously with Superman I.

0553213105|5.0|I'm not sure what can be helpfully added to the 487 prior reviews of P&amp;P but I enjoyed this one so much that I must try.  This is a fantastic work and should be the textbook for aspiring novelists' Storytelling 101 class.  Austin's ability to create compelling characters that leap off the page and to maneuver them through an intelligent, gripping narrative is amazing.  Despite the passage of 200 years, her characters resonate with their timeless flaws and virtues.  I particularly enjoyed the snippets of intelligent, wry humor from both Elizabeth Bennett and, most notably, from her father Mr. Bennett.  I finished the book on an airplane and struggled to stifle laughs.<br />As an aside, the BBC/A&amp;E 5-6 hour version of P&amp;P is the best film adaptation of a classic book that I have ever seen and is well worth the time investment.
B000005HLV|5.0|What is there to say about Mayhem that hasn't already been said? If it weren't for them black metal probably wouldn't be where it is at today. Mayhem is one of the original black metal bands, and along with Darkthrone they popularized the modern black metal movement. If it were not for them bands like Cradle of Filth, Marduk, Dimmu Borgir, and Dark Funeral might not be around. Anyways, this album is a brutal assault of black metal with classic songs like &quot;Funeral Fog&quot;, &quot;Freezing Moon&quot;, and &quot;From the Dark Past&quot;. If you call yourself a black metal fan then you need to know this. Although they aren't the best black metal band they deserve respect among any black metal fan.

Back in the 80's they were kids, full of energy and all that, doin that thrash metal that really caught on.  Now, they come out with Load, and they're grown a$$ men, just listen to the cd.  It sounds like something a grown man would listen to, this cd reminds me of cigars, beer, bbq, stuff that real men such as myself enjoy. You kids can stay back in the 80s with your big blonde hair and tight leather suits, while us real men can smoke cigars, drink beer, watch football, bbq, and listen to Load.  hahahahahahaha
0553208845|4.0|This is one of my favorite reads. It is a simply perplexing tale of a boy turned man physically and spiritually. As a reference point from a Roman Catholic it serves as an incredibly educational and engaging book. Because I am not a dogmatically practicing Catholic I am intrigued by different beliefs and try to integrate them with my own. With my limited knowledge of Buddhism I know that Theravada Buddhists do not think of the \\"Buddha\\" as a god, but its major counterpart Mahayana (excluding the minor sect Zen Buddhist teachings of harmony) do warship the Buddha as a god. For me the most valuable of the two would be the former, because it does not conflict with the beliefs I am comfortable with while showing me a vastly different view of life. I believe that Siddhartha is from the perspective of a Theravada Buddhist-or at least that's what I believe when I am reading the book-and exhibits an aura of a different way of thinking. It is definitely worth the money and the time. This book is a good start for continued research into different religions, but it doesn't offer a full view of Buddhism.  If, by reading Siddhartha, one feels his journey into the depths of Buddhism is sufficient the reader is wrong.<br />PS In order to get five stars from me the book would have to be a little more comprehensive.
0679882820|5.0|My son loves books with rhymes which is why he enjoys this book so much. At 11 months old, he gets distracted quite easily with books that tell a story. They just don't seem to grab his attention. This book is short, but sweet. He grins from ear to ear when I ask \\"Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You?\\".
B00009M6VJ|5.0|When I saw this movie, I wanted to see it again and again, it was so good. This movie made me cry, and frecked me out a bit. Some parts were funny others were intese. For those people out there who always read the critics reveiws first before going to the movies, and don't see what they intened on seeing, don't always take someones word for it that what you always read isn't true. Because this movie did not desverive two stars it desverived more than that, like five or more. Kevin Spacey, I thought desvrivered an oscar for his performace I thought this movie was that great. Kate Winslet was great too, she did a really fantastic job. It's hard trying to make the audience really believe the actors that they are really this people in the movie, and in this movie I really thought that I was with these people on a mission to find the truth, seeing thier lives. Great acting should take you away completely from reality, this movie did. I highly highly recomend this film to anyone who is a fan of the actors, director, the story. You'll love it, but be carefull don't watch this film to many times because it's a tear-jerker deffenatlly.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes' \\"Elephant\\" is an awesome album,and so far, the best album released this year. This was only recorded on an 8 track by Jack and Meg White, but it sounds more like 4 or 5. The guitars are blaring, the vocals very unique and appealing, and the drums are very heavy. Jack White's songwriting is amazing, and his cover of a Burt Bacharach song ('I Just Don't Know...') sounds like he wrote the song himself, adding his own original style to it. The blues influence on this record is very evident, especially on the 7-minute ode to sexual innuendos \\"Ball and Biscuit,\\" and the simple \\"In the Cold, Cold Night,\\" which features Meg on lead vocals. Her voice is different than Jack's, adding a very sweet essence to the song. It's refreshing to hear Meg's voice on this album, especially now with the Britneys of the world, because Meg actually has a good voice. It's not too sophisticated, but it's a lot more organic than most female vocalists out there. <BR>There's also a raw rock sound to many of the songs, a la Stooges, or the early Kinks, like on \\"Black Math,\\" and \\"Hypnotize.\\" For only 2 people in the band, it sounds very powerful and energetic. The catchy first single \\"Seven Nation Army,\\" the Queen-influenced \\"There's No Home For You Here,\\" and the heartwarming \\"I Want to be the Boy to Warm Your Mother's Heart,\\" represent the many styles the White Stripes are capable of doing, and proves that you can be eclectic and amazing with only 2 people in your band.
0156027321|4.0|The book's premise is unique.  I must admit, however, I was skeptical at first.  A boy and a tiger on a lifeboat adrift at sea - the concept seems somewhat far fetched.  Nevertheless, Martel writes very convincingly and goes to great lengths to make the reader a believer.<br />It starts off slow.  At 354 pages it is a relatively short read and Pi (Martel's protagonist) doesn't find himself on the lifeboat until a third of the way through the book.  That being said, the wait is well worth it.  The ending is particularly good, especially if you enjoy twists.
0671015206|3.0|This novel helped me realize that i dont want to live my life with so much regard towards money nor do i want to focus on material gain in such high esteem. i am not naive to the idea that you need it to survive, but i dont want it to be the force that drives me to succeed. It is interesting to see how the true millionaires live and it proved my perception of the wealthy to be false. It taught me that not all is as it seems.
B00005JKED|4.0|It's what you can prove.  My favorite motto from Denzel.  In this movie, a curropted cop gets a rookie, and tries to get him mixed in with his problems.  These are the main characters.<br />Alanzo Harris:Denzel won his first best actor's award ever(He won best supporting actor in Glory), and I see why, good acting, with using a lot of good metaphors and stuff.  He may seem like a good narcotics officer, but his actions will get him killed, unless he can pay off his debts.  But before he does that, he needs a pawn in his game.<br />Jake:Ethan Hawke played good in this movie too as a rookie cop.  He gets his chance at being a narcotics officer, thanks to Alanzo.  He has to show what he can prove in 24 hours, but a lot of bumps are up the road, and it prooves he's scared to find out the shocking truth.<br />The movie got off to a great start, and had very good twists, but when it rolled towards the end, it started to fall apart, and I was a pretty dissapointed how the movie ended, but Denzel stayed true to his acting roots all throughout the movie.  If you like to see Denzel at one of his finest, go pick this up, if you like a good ol' cop movie, then this will be interesting.  And remember, It's not what you know, it's what you can prove.
B00008QSA5|4.0|This CD shows two things, one the brilliance of Bloomfield's playing and two, just how far he had fallen as a result of his Heroin addiction.  After nine hours of recording, Bloomfield and Kooper completed Bloomfield's &quot;Albert's Shuffle&quot;, &quot;His Holy Modal Majesty&quot; and &quot;Really&quot;, Howard Tate's &quot;Stop&quot;, and Curtis Mayfield's &quot;Man's Temptation&quot;. At the completion of these first five tunes, Bloomfield packed up his things and abruptly left the studio. Kooper wanted to complete the recording so he picked up the phone and called Stephen Stills.  Still's agreed to finish the sessions.  As such you get two very different sounding recordings here.  The first half--Kooper and Bloomfield which contains some very nice blues and classic Bloomfield guitar. The last half features Kooper and Stills complete with jangly guitar and Buffalo Springfield like vocals.   The disc is rounded out with some added bonus material featuring remix versions of &quot;Albert's Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; without the horns and two others. An added bonus is &quot;Fat Grey Clound&quot; which is a masterpiece in itself. On the other hand, while this disc has some good tunes on it the addition of Stills and absence of Bloomfield leaves the recording with a hodgepodge quality.  As an alternative or in addition to this disc, check out the &quot;Lost Concert Tapes&quot;.
B00005JLH3|5.0|At first, I hated Nick Cannon, because he can't rap at all, but, this movie definitly made me appreciate his acting.<br />Devon Miles:The main man of the movie.  He cam out of NYC, and made it to a university on Atlanta.  There he pushes his skills to the limit, and learns a lot on the way.  But yet, when he showboats, and tries to act fresh.... oh man it cost him bigtime.<br />Dr. Lee:The condicter of the band.  He's more of a traditional guy, so don't expect him to really like hip-hop or anything else new age.  But when one performance messes up bigtime, he tries to mix up old school and New School, but Devon made a mistake when he took a solo.<br />This movie is a real good movie.  I mean, it's definitly a positive movie, which are some of my favoirte movies.  If you like bands, or something like that, this one's sure to catch you eye.
B00006G8O1|5.0|Donnie Darko is a rare mixture of suspense, comedy, horror, European cinema with a twist, and then some. Donnie (played by Jake Gyllenhaal from Bubble Boy) is a bright student who's on therapy and visits his doctor who discovers Doonie's sleepwalking activities during a hypnosis session. He has a happy life and is not bitter about anything. One night hears the call of a 6-foot rabbit and goes on a sleepwalking stroll, while a jet engine falls through his room. The event changes his life, as the encounters with the strange rabbit are more frequent. The FAA doesn't know where the engine came from as no airline has reported one missing from their planes, and everything is a bit confusing for everyone. The movie has some interesting scenes like one where Patrick Swayze plays a local author and inspirational speaker who goes to Donnie's school to speak to the students, and Donnie asks him \\"how much did they pay you to be here?\\" followed by an awkward silence. <br />There are a few scenes where style takes over substance, one with what looks like a slow-mo steadycam continuous shot through halls and then out to the yard of the school to sound of Tears for Fears. Some say that mentally ill people tell it like it is because of their condition, but here we have a bright student-Donnie- who is a little, or a lot-depends how you see it- Schizophrenic and takes every chance to just blurt out his personal opinion-and one with which many of us agree- about the system. <br />Like the scene where his gym teacher asks him to read from a card with some sample life experience and draw an x between \\"fear\\" and \\"love\\" on the board to illustrate where his life's experiences fall with in the two. He tells the teacher \\"it's not that simple...life's more complicated than that...one can't just categorize everything into two extremes...\\" I won't tell you what Donnie told the teacher to do with her little cards but he ends up in the principal's office. Donnie sees some gel like extensions coming from their families bodies as if arrows that point towards the future, so he starts discussing time travel and wormholes with his science teacher, who stops taking about it when the \\"G\\" word enters their discussion: God. The teacher replies \\"I can lose my job\\". The movie is filled with these social observations. In school you can talk about the universe at length, but not about religion. The local celebrity (Sawyze), whom the gym teacher respects, is caught running a pornography ring from his basement. Drew Barry, the English teacher is let go because she doesn't fit in with the school's conservative values.           <br />The movie keeps us interested, because there's a smooth flow of scenes, and it has scary moments, not based on violence and blood, but on suspense, mood, and wonder. Where did the rabbit come from, what's the meaning of the strange messages it tells Donnie?<BR>Is it just an illusion? Then why did it save his life? Is Donnie a psychic? All these questions are answered but not like you'd expect. There are twists and turns like in any drunken pretzel. This is not your typical formula, and at the end we feel the movie works not because of it's ending, but because of the trip there.
B00005Y228|5.0|I was not a fan of Kylie before i picked up this album on an impulse but now i am definitely a huge fan of hers. Absolutely FANTASTIC! Enough said.
B000089RVX|5.0|I heard Evanescence first in the Daredevil trailer. My sister heard it and wanted to download Bring Me To Life. Of course, I had alrady downloaded it, and listened to it 50 million times. It was Amy Lee's haunting vocals amongst the rock that got me hooked. It was exactly as the press said: Sarah McLauchlan singing to Nine Inch Nails. I then made it my mission to get all their songs to see if I wanted to buy their album.<BR>One listen to Hello, and I bought it in a flash. Her absolutely beautiful voice still sings in my head everywhere I go.<BR>Going Under was the first song apart from Bring Me To Life that I abolutely loved when I got it. Listen to it, especially the parts where she sings \\"I'm dying again\\" - you will fall in love with her, especially if you're a guy.<BR>All the other songs are worthy of our ears, but writing praise for the simply wouldn't do them justice. In other words, just buy this album. You need it.
0140177396|5.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is the tale of two traveling laborers in California named George, who is small, quick and intelligent, and Lennie, who is enormous and incredibly strong but posseses the mind of a child.  The story follows George and Lennie as they work on a small ranch in California's Salinas Valley trying to achieve their dream of owning their own little patch of land.  George tries to protect Lennie from getting into trouble with the boss' pugnacious son, Curley, and his overly &quot;friendly&quot; wife.  However, just when it seemed that their dream was in reach, Lennie's unwavering devotion to George and his determination not to disappoint him bring the story to a tragic end that could bring a tear to even the most stoic of eyes.
0790737345|2.0|\\"City of Angels\\" has a lot of cool ideas. It has a great style of direction about it. It's biggest problem is that it falls under the standard movie cliches for love stories. A shame, because the first two acts are very good. Nicolas Cage is an angel. He walks the Earth unnoticed and unseen by humans. It is suggested that in death, one can see or feel the angels, which is an interesting concept indeed. Meg Ryan is a doctor who is a little lovesick. Cage follows her around one day and becomes increasingly interested in her. Finally, she sees him and the two begin to fall in love. So far, the movie is interesting, original, and very well-acted. Then it comes to a point where Cage must make a choice. He must either stay an angel or become human and live with Meg. It doesn't take a genius to predict what happens. The movie loses itself in utter predictability and uses recycled story elements from so many other romance movies. I realize I'm a guy and that I probably shouldn't like this movie anyway, but I believe in giving movies a fair chance. I like the first two acts of this movie a lot. I like the concept, I like the characters, and I like the acting. The third act is just so contrived and desparate I wanted to shout in anger at the screen during its climax. I didn't hate this film. I just hated the outcome. Would I recommend it? No. But I don't doubt that there are people that liked it.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Nobody does mellow better than Jack Johnson.  I'm not sure what it is - maybe Jack's sweetly mellow voice, Adam's conga drumming, or Merlo's incomparable bass grooves - but this band is seriously addictive! The lyrics are simple, but not too simplistic and the tunes are alternately soulful and funky.  Jack has said in interviews that Adam (I believe) is into Latin percussion; that influence is definitely felt in their amazing version of \\"Rodeo Clowns.\\"  \\"Mediocre Bad Guys\\" is a another great song reminiscent of Neil Young, \\"Taylor\\" is a fun track that Jack usually sings at concerts, and \\"Cookie Jar\\" is a simmering missive about societal responsibility.  \\"Tomorrow Morning\\" (presumably written for Jack's wife) is an apology to a loved one for being away so often.  JJ's music is great as it can be appreciated on so many levels, depending on one's mood or intellectual inclinations.  Thanks to Jack, Merlo, Adam and the Moonshine Conspiracy for another fantastic album!
0345404475|4.0|As of now, I have completed three Philip Dick novel; A Scanner Darkly, The Game Players of Titan and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.  While all were thoroughly engrossing, particularly A Scanner Darkly, this story rings most accessible.  Rather than deal with elements such as psychic and telekenetic powers, or the consequences of drug abuse, Dick lays out a story universal in both symbolism and characterization.  While the movie exploits the idea of Rick Deckard being an adroid through a contrived and unsatisfying climax, the book requests we view Deckard as a human facing mental anguish, which borders on a stale mechanical existence.  Dick's use of machine life questions our beliefs on human's motivation on topics ranging from friendship to religion.  In addition, the ease by which one can understand the story is simple compared to his other novels.  The ending, while glum, is satisfying because Deckard's journey to the truth allows him to surmise the phoniness that has spread among the humans he lives with.
0380820846|5.0|I have to admit I was slow in getting this book and this is the first Bridgerton book I have read. (Go on, avid Quinn readers, laugh at me,)The prologue of the book already got me hooked as it was just so hilarious.<br />Penelope is a character I'm sure a lot of plain women will identify with; she's not your typical 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'exquisite beauty'. Bottomline: She's normal. She's average, and that is one of the reasons I really liked this book.<br />Besides the excellent chemistry between the Bridgertons, Lady Whistledown is also a very refreshing character. Her 'Society Papers' at the beginning of each chapter made me so tempted to read on, and on, and on...just to find out what other gossip she has about the ton. In this book, readers will also (finally!) get to find out the identity of Lady Whistledown (gasp!) and the answer will definitely shock you!<br />Okay, I don't want to give too much of the story away, (even though I'm VERY tempted,) just go and get the book!<br />Aaah! I can't wait for Eloise's story in the next instalment of the Bridgerton series 'To Sir Philip, With Love'! Is anyone as excited as me?
0345448898|4.0|Complex ideas; strong, credible, multidimensional (in every sense) characters - this knocks Harry Potter into a cocked hat.<BR>The first book (Northern Lights here in Britain, The Golden Compass in the US) is the most perfectly realised. Lyra's world is a place of wonder & grandeur & the balance of plot, action & character had me racing to the end.<BR>Book two, The Subtle Knife, suffers slightly from being largely set in our own mundane world, and the writing is comparatively flat & plot-driven. But there's much to treasure & the third book would be incomprehensible without reading this first.<BR>The Amber Spyglass, last & longest, introduces great new characters, places & concepts, exceeds the ambition & in places the execution of Northern Lights and if it's flabby here & there, it more often achieves the epic richness the story deserves.<BR>Pullman's creations will live in children's & adults' imaginations for a long time: apart from the 12-year-old main protagonists, wily Lyra & fearless Will, there's the exquisitely villainous Marisa Coulter & her malevolent golden monkey, the ambiguous antihero Lord Asriel (think Magneto in the X-Men), the noble bear Iorek Byrnison, gyptian king John Faa, the gay angels Baruch & Balthamos & numerous others.<BR>These are supremely moral books; Pullman doesn't flinch from confronting his heroes' failings (as well as society's) but they usually do the right thing. He's unsentimental, yet Iorek's farewell to Lyra had me blubbing. The chapter in The Amber Spyglass where Mary befriends the alien mulefa is beautiful & haunting.<BR>Pullman has said that separating his child-heroes from their parents is chiefly a storytelling device to allow them to operate independently, but here the parentage of both Lyra & Will is central to the story. And he effortlessly absolves himself from accusations of \\"too many coincidences\\" by establishing early on a sense that everything is happening because it is ordained to happen.<BR>As a sidenote, Pullman is a patron of the National Secular Society in Britain & it's clear he doesn't think much of organised religion. As I said, a sound moral influence for our kids. ;-)
B00005JKPF|5.0|X2 is probably the best sequel to a superhero film since Superman II.  Yes, it's that good and easily surpasses the first film in every way.  The first film was perhaps necessary as an introduction to the many people who hadn't heard of the X-Men.  With this film, the X-Men are back and more of the traditional old school \\"new\\" X-Men are introduced.  The film is loosely based upon an X-Men graphic novel called \\"God Loves, Man Kills\\" as well as borrowed snippets from other X-Men stories (including the beginning of the Phoenix saga) that have been fused together for the screenplay that brings in a few original elements as well.  The theme of man's intolerance towards his fellow man continues as the forces of hate attempt to destroy the mutants.  X2 promotes this theme quite effectively as it also tackles real issues, sometimes in allegorical form, such as terrorism and what constitutes a freedom fighter.  The opening sequence with Nightcrawler (a new X-Man not seen in the first film) makes his appearance in a big way in the compelling opening segment.  The action is non-stop and the characters are all so interesting that many of them could indeed have films of their own.  This comes with the decades of comicbook material that has been written for them of course.  Thus, Wolverine's rapid falling in love scenario reflects the attraction between Logan and Jean Grey in the comics that has taken years to develop, whereas in the film it's more of a love at first sight compression due to time constraints.  This is fine as the movie attempts to cover a lot of ground and manages to do so by sacrificing natural character development for a very big cast of characters.<br />Singer deserves a lot of credit for making a film that is literally teeming with interesting characters though.  In such films, it can be reduced to a convoluted mess.  Not so with Singer's able direction.  The characters mostly get their limelight moments (some more than others), but it is the sum of the partsthat make the movie fun to watch.  For those uninitiated with comicbooks, the story might be difficult to follow, but if you pay attention it can be accessible to anyone.  If you know the background of the characters, you'll understand everything without too much effort.  For laypersons, the special effects and action alone are worth the price of admission.  <br />I recommend this film to the many readers of the X-Men who grew up reading about their world where issues regarding diversity and tolerance were explored with an increasingly adult slant.  This film brought back some great memories of my childhood and teenhood and for that alone I was very entertained.  The acting by the principal actors is top-notch with Sir Ian McKellan having the presence with the most gravitas, while Brian Cox again delivers a great job as the villain of the piece.  Hugh Jackman is a great Wolverine and inbues his character with the right balance of style and emotion.  Alan Cumming deserves some mention for his German accented Nightcrawler rendition, as he acts convincingly through the tons of makeup.  The rest of the cast all play their parts quite effectively as well.  It's rumored that Halle Berry was not pleased with her shortened screen-time and perhaps the next film will give her Storm character more of a pivotal role.  The star of the X-Men is Wolverine though.  He is the most popular in the comics because he combines a sense of danger and mystery that interests people.  Thus, for this reason, the events in the X-Men emanate from Wolverine, sometimes to the detriment of the other characters.  So although this is an ensemble piece, it's a Wolverine-centered film and I, for one, have no problem with that.  And I can't wait for X-Men 3, which will, no doubt, feature the Dark Phoenix (another revered storyline from the comics) saga that is probably the most definitive X-Men story written.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Here's a review of every track:<BR>1. Foreword - Not really a song but I love how it mixes into the next track. 9/10<BR>2. Don't Stay - A song for the fans who prefer Chester.  It's amazing how he goes from these soft tones to these crazy yells.  Brad also happens to tear up the guitar.  Great songto open up the album. 9/10<BR>3. Somewhere I Belong - More on the softer side but still a good track.  I really like how the intro was put together.  Mike sounds pretty cool on the lyrical side of this, but Chester just doesn't pull through for me here. 8/10<BR>4. Lying From You - Chester sounds much better here and Mike begins his lyrical tear up that will conquer most of the rest of the album.  Liked it. 8.5/10<BR>5. Hit The Floor - Awesome song.  Chester and Mike are so [good] in the chorus and Mike's verses destroy.  Brad's guitar sounds so cool here as well. 9.5/10<BR>6. Easier To Run - I like to call this \\"Crawling: The Sequel\\".  It's got that heavy sounding chorus with the light verses that defined Crawling.  This is actually my least favorite because it seems very old and formulaic (if that's even a word). 6/10<BR>7. Faint - One of my favorites on the album.  Starts off with one of Rob's killer drum beats and leads to some very cool Mike-flows.  Chester rules the chorus but it's nothing compared to how cool he is in the bridge which is enhanced by Brad's awesome guitar work.  Everything just seems to fit. 10/10<BR>8. Figure.09 - Another killer song.  Sounds a lot like a faster and harder upgrade of By Myself.  Once again, Brad's guitaring rules especially in conjunction with Mike and Chester during the bridge. 9.5/10<BR>9. Breaking the Habit - My favorite song on the album and the most different song on the album.  The song is more of a techno-acoustic song with light Chester vocals.  Despite how boring that may sound it is actually a very killer journey through how high a song could bewhile being so low (if you even follow me there).  Spectacular.  10/10<BR>10. From The Inside - The verse is very reminiscent of Crawling except Mike's part is much cooler.  The bridge is another example of how well Brad's guitar can work so well with Chester's yelling.  9/10<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - Think Linkin Parkish Wu-Tang.  The Japanese flute that plays throughout the song is the perfect sound for the song wich pretty much belong to Mike busting out some pretty phat rhymes.  9.5/10<BR>12. Session - Ahhh...the time comes for Mr. Joe Hahn to see what he can do. It's the CD's Cure For The Itch and trust me, it rules.  More of an asian feel if you ask me and the software he uses really enhance how cool this instrumental sounds. 9/10<BR>13. Numb - Great way to end the album.  Chester's light vocals leave you in a kind of dream state.  This is genuinely a good song because of how good Chester can hold it. 9/10<br />There it is.  Go get it.  I'll live up to your standards.  An evolution in an already great band.
B00004WF68|5.0|This album was one of a few records that opened my mind up to what a record album could do to take you beyond the dingy little place you happened to be in, in my case, Cedar Rapids, IA. Along with &quot;Sgt. Pepper, Blonde on Blonde and Cricklewood Green&quot; it transported me to the really cool places you would like to be but would never get to. What ties all these together, besides the genius of the artists, the quality of the production. &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; was recorded at Olympic Studios and was produced by Jimmy Miller. I think you can safely assume that any recording with either of these on the credits are memorable. The time period this record sprang from marked a revolution in record production. So while you may or may not like every song on the disc, please listen to and appreciate the craft displayed within. They don't make them like this anymore.
B00008BXJF|5.0|When I discovered just a few days ago that there was a new studio King Crimson CD, I didn't hesitate to get it. I love The ConstruKction of Light, but this is in many ways better. The most significant improvement is regarding the ProjeKct X-like spacey interludes. On ConstruKction, the ProjeKct X material at the end of the album served as a rather unrelated, albeit enjoyable and interesting Coda. Here, the ProjeKct X sound is integrated with the rest of the CD by distributing \\"The Power to Believe\\" throughout the disk. Fripp first used this kind of musical form in \\"In the Wake of Poseidon,\\" lending overall structure to the album, elevating a collection of songs to a cohesive work considerably more complex, and ultimately, more deeply affecting.<br />\\"The Power to Believe\\" opens with a simple version of the title piece, labeled a cappella is a bit misleadingly, since Belew's voice is so intensely filtered and processed electronically. \\"She carries me through days of apathy, she washes over me. She saved my life, in a manner of speaking, when she gave me back the power to believe.\\" This is followed by a monstrous (i.e., rocking, great!) piece, \\"Level Five,\\" reminiscent of \\"Discipline.\\"<br />King Crimson always includes lovely, acoustic tunes to soften the blows, and \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" represents yet another shimmering entry, just as attractive as the best of \\"Beat.\\" \\"Elektrik,\\" begins with woodwinds and smashes into a piece that recalls \\"Red\\" and the \\"Larks's Tongues\\" series. \\"Facts of Life\\" is expansive and mysterious in its opening, and we again are banged up against the side of head with a rocker that harkens back to \\"Indiscipline.\\" Belew is in his element, singing soulfully over the cacophony, tongue-in-cheek.<br />After the wickedness of \\"Facts,\\" a return to the calm and introspection of \\"Power\\" is in order. This is an extended exploration of the musical theme introduced a cappella by Belew. The atmospherics remind me of moments from \\"Larks' Tongues\\" and \\"Three of a Perfect Pair.\\" Exotic percussion builds in intensity and accompaniment by electronic glissandi in high and low registers take this soaring to the skies. Although I don't recall seeing other reviewers mentioning this, I think this is yet another reason why comparisons are being made to the masterful album \\"Discipline.\\" I haven't heard anything like this from Fripp since \\"The Sheltering Sky.\\"<br />\\"Power\\" is followed straight up with the climax of the album, the spectacular \\"Dangerous Curves.\\" Echoes of mellotrons lead into a piece that is not unlike \\"The Devil's Triangle.\\" The percussion is driving and the engineering crystal clear, which is fortunate because the piece becomes very loud and requires no more distortion than what is intended.<br />A time-warp takes us into \\"Happy with What You Have to be Happy with,\\" a humourous and rocking knod to and knock at post-metal mediocrity. The final two tracks reprise \\"Power,\\" and the sparely accompanied melody is, in the final analysis, quite moving.<br />I find this latest contribution to be instantly compelling. I listened to it immediately five times in a row, and it took about that long to figure most of it out. Incredibly, yet another masterpiece from Fripp and his team, and, I would argue, overall the best work King Crimson has ever produced. Practice makes perfect!!of a Perfect Pair.\\" Exotic percussion builds in intensity and accompaniment by electronic glissandi in high and low registers take this soaring to the skies.

The final two tracks reprise \\"Power,\\" and the sparely accompanied melody is, in the final analysis, quite moving.<br />I find this latest contribution to be instantly compelling. I listened to it immediately five times in a row, and it took about that long to figure most of it out. Incredibly, yet another masterpiece from Fripp and his team, and, I would argue, overall the best work King Crimson has ever produced. Practice makes perfect!!
B000066NW0|4.0|This is an impressive album from someone so young. It seems obvious that Avril Lavigne is meant to be a musician and is extermely talented. There is some truly great songwriting showcased here.<br />My complaint is that the album seems poorly edited. It starts out with some very strong songs and then seems to get weaker as the album progresses. I believe this album would have been a stronger album if one or two of the weaker songs were left out.<br />Also, the fidelity of the album seems slightly tinny sounding. I'm not sure if this is due to the instrumenation or to equalization in the studio.<br />I would certainly recommend this CD for the great songs like Losing Grip, I'm With You and Complicated, Mobile and others, but know that there are one or two tracks that are less than memorable.

B0000041Q3|5.0|To let the amateur critic's remarks that this Turandot is &quot;ridiculous as first choice&quot; left me sleepless for several nights. This dispute also goes for the other one who thinks Sutherland's voice is not large enough for Turandot. Here goes.<br />First, this listener must not know that Joan Sutherland in 30 years of glorious career sang the operas that contain the highest tessitura of any  written. Turandot, for a verisimo opera, DOES have a rather high tessitura for a Puccini opera, but you can't compare that sort of tessitura to La Sonnambula, Norma, Esclamonde, Puritani, Beatrice di Tenda, or even a heavily decorated Lucia di Lammermoor. My gosh, in Puritani, the first mad scene had six high C's and one high D in one phrase. In NOrma, Sutherland raised every single duet and aria one full step whenever she could find an Adagisa who could match her. She lived in the stratosphere of high tessitura. To say that she can't compete with Nilsson in the area of high tessitura prove that this listener has just not heard Joan Sutherland seriously. <br />Also it is rediculous to compare Turandot's high tessitura to the rediculously high tessitura of the bel canto operas. Especially when Sutherland embellished those bel canot opera arias with every single high note opportunity available. In fact Sutherland sang in the stratosphere of the highest tessitura so often that many listeners had critique her as having had bad diction. It's not the bad diction, it's just she's constantly singing in the highest regions of a soprano's range.<br />Really now! The tessitura in Turandot, a verismo opera does lies high for a Wagnerian dramatic soprano, but is nothing for a high coloratura soprano such as Sutherland. Sutherland can sing in the E string of a violin for probably three hours with ease. While if Nilsson or Callas did that they would be hoarse for weeks. As almost all of my opera colleagues agree, she sang not one sour note in this entire set of Turandot. And believe meNilsson and others went off tune often, and screamed their high C's. I dare say Sutherland's high C in her great aria In Questa Reggia is by far the strongest, most lovely in tone, and secure of all the famous sets of Turandot. Don't believe me, listen to it.<br />As for the other amateur listener who thinks that Sutherland's high notes are not comparable to Nilsson. He must not have heard Sutherland in the 1960's as I have. I dare say that not only was Sutherland's high notes more spectacular than Nilsson's when Sutherland was in her 1960 prime, they were without the sharp edge of Nilsson's and they(Sutherland's) were never cold and out of tune(sharp) as Nilsson's. Sutherland's high notes were among the most beautiful to ever grace a stage. They were always rock solid, never wabbly or weak. Until her later years Sutherland's high notes were one of the reasons that she was the most in demand soprano of the operatic world for well over 25 years. Sorry, I got carried away, but this is all true.<br />To put another perspective to it, however, Nilsson was the ultimate Wagnerian diva of our era. But one of the reason she could sing Wagner was her sharp edge that cut through the orchestra...not always pretty. Sutherland did that without the edge. That makes Turandot's final transition to poignant womanhood believable while Nilsson remain cold as ice! <br />For those several listeners who kept stating that Sutherland did not have a large enough voice or couldn't deal with the high tessitura, they simply hasn't heard many LIVE operas with Sutherland, Callas, and Nilsson. OR perhaps he or she only listens to LIVE recordings...or just studio recordings. Because in the realm of a real operatic stage the Sutherland sound is all emcompassing, it is strikingly powerful through most of the range to the highest stratosphere of high E(though not low), it is hauntingly beautiful, and dead on accurate. <br />IT is for the world to hear that this Turandot with Sutherland/Pavarotti is the standard. And I will say again, Sutherland is the perfect Turandot on record because of her power in the middle and high register without even a hint of a strain. All the while maintaining a warm beautiful sound that her competitors could not even begin to compete. <br />But after that remark, I have to admit that Nilsson was the greatest dramatic soprano of our era, and as a career Wagnerian dramatic soprano, she was  better suited overall for Wagner and Puccini than Sutherland on the stage. (But I still think Sutherland would have made a fine Wagnerian or Verdian soprano had she not have been convinced otherwise by her husband). <br />But for now, in this recording. True Wagnerian or not, you can say it's the microphone placement or whatever, Sutherland is by far the superior Turandot. NO if, or's, or but's. That's my opinion. And it's an opinion of an opera buff who has heard divas from Flagstad to Marton. <br />Oh, yeah, as for Caballe, she is great as Liu, edging out Scotto and Tebaldi. Pavarotti? His just about perfect as Calaf, although not as exciting as Corelli. As for the conducting, Mehta beats them all. Nough said.
B000002H33|5.0|This album came out a few years before Metallica started to slump. The songs on this album are so dedicated toward their belifes and the music reflects that. The songs are so fast and so heavy, and then you get to &quot;Welcome Home&quot; and it just slow down the pace a bit while still keeping us interested. While released 5 years before their hit, &quot;Metallica&quot;, the songs reflect the true nature and heaviness of the band while Cliff Burton still played the bass for them. One would wonder how they would pull through after  band member had died, but there were tributes done by Metallica to show that they still, and always will remember him. However, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; still is one of the most influential albums to ever grace the music world. Many artists have made claims to fame saying this album is the one that started it all. Me being a guitarist have it as one of my favourites. The music is heavy, the lyrics are powerful, and the songs are memorable. One of the best thrash-metal albums ever.
0743216458|4.0|This is a great book no doubt and it's not a boring war history type book like your thinking either. The author does a great job of showing how gruesome the training was and how horrible battle is without being too gruesome for younger readers while there are a few swear words a majority is like [stars] as a substitue. <BR>The only problem I could say is this a True Life war book. Meaning people die, and it's hard to keep track of all the new people coming in and out. You don't get much background on people because they all die so quickly, I won't say too much more as to not ruin the book. <BR>I gave it 4 out of 5. If you don't mind reading very slowly and carefully and you want a good war book that chapters the horrors of war but doesn't disgust you this is one to pick up!
B00008H2LB|3.0|I realise that most of you have a negative view on this CD but on some points you have to admit, you are over judging. The CD maybe short, but come on now, back in the fifties and sixties songs were barely over two minutes long. Leave the long songs to bands like Metalica and Ozzy, but don't criticize the ones that don't pull off that almost-but-not-quite-annoyingly-long song thing.<br />Meteora does get a little repetitive and grow old a tad too quick, but they also have their unique musical style from the first CD, Hybrid Theory. They mix rap, rock, classical, and a  little bit of pop at the times. Instead of criticising them for their originality, applaud them for there non-comformity. <br />Though not as good as Hybrid Theory, this CD is well worth a listen to.

B0000028UK|5.0|Pearl Jam is a band noted for their aggression and power. Eddie Vedder's growling yet swooning voice. The double guitar action. It's power at its finest. And this album is the most powerful of them all.<br />Go - The perfect way to start off an album. A hard-rocker with a solid chorus and a grunge guitar riff. 7/10<br />Animal - Probably the most powerful and aggressive song Pearl Jam has ever recorded. The grunge guitar riff is classic and the chorus &quot;I'd rather be with an animal&quot; sticks in your head. It is a great song to play live. 9/10<br />Daughter - The most radio-friendly song on the album. The opening acoustic guitar chords are instantly catchy and Vedder's poetic words are touching. Being a story about child abuse (I think), It makes the song that much better. The chorus is amazing and McCready's guitar solo is on fire. 9/10<br />Glorified G - This song is a very poppy song with a message. Its a scream for the banning of firearms in our country. The chorus is catchy. Vedder's voice is very powerful here in the &quot;always keep it loaded&quot; part. very impressive. 8/10<br />Dissident - Another very radio-friendly song with an amazing guitar riff. This song is where the double guitar action shines. If you were to listen to only one song on this album it should be &quot;Dissident&quot;. It's a perfect Alternative Rock song. 9/10<br />W.M.A. - Absolutely incredible. The words and the rhythem to this song are outstanding. It has a very exotic to feel to it which makes it even more interesting. Very aggressive song that will take you time to appreciate. But I promise that you will. 8/10<br />Blood - In my opinion, this is the weakest track on the album. It is very hard-rockin but just never got my full attention. The only song on the album I can skip. 6/10<br />Rearviewmirror - A great driving song and a live favorite. The words to this song are catchy and the pause inbetween is a nice addition. The ending of this song is amazing so check it out. 7.5/10<br />Rats - A little better than &quot;Blood&quot; I used to like this song a lot but I fell out of it. The words and theme are interesting but only for the real Pearl Jam fans. 7/10<br />Elderly Woman... - A nice acoustic song with predictable lyrics and a very basic song structure. Still very catchy and another good live song. 7.5/10<br />Leash - Wow! So powerful and amazing. Great lyrics and grunge feel. I love this song check it out! 8/10<br />Indifference - The best song on the album. The lyrics are probably the best lyrics I have ever heard. The music is very soothing too. I can't explain enough how much I love this song 10/10

B000002552|4.0|First, let me state, that this is the album that affected most the last two years of my life. Nothing is the same.<BR>Then, some of you may rightly ask, why have I given this album only a four-star rating? &quot;Well, just because&quot;. The problem of this album is exactly what made it so great: The value that is more that the mere sum of the parts.  <BR>The problem is, that this album is a game of hide-and-seek. It creates a feeling of.. How the Hell should I put it?<BR>SOMETHING happend. Something real bad. It's not, I'm lead to believe, just a case of &quot;re-inventing Americana&quot; (more close to the truth is that we hear Dylan re-inventing the Band), and It's not even Bob having an accident - an image which I can't shake away as I listen to most of his songs. There's more. <BR>But what? well, best summed, is &quot;Nothing was Delivered&quot;. We are left with the feeling of a drama without characters. But then you realise the &quot;Nothing&quot; IS the character. Get it? Neither do I. Only I think about it repeatedly for two years now and it's eating my brain... <BR>The problem with thuis album is not in it - but with what it does. Can you recall the first time you heard &quot;A day in a Life&quot; AFTER being told about the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; thingie? right. How many of you were able to TRULY shake any thought of that afterwards? <BR>This Album has this kind of shadow, only you are left to make up a puzzle on youre own: &quot;Million Dollar Bash&quot;, &quot;You Ain't Going Nowhere&quot;,&quot;Too much of Nothing&quot;, &quot;Nothing was delivered&quot; and, of course, &quot;This wheel's on fire&quot; are my favorite pieces.<BR> Nevertheless, on the Band's part, I thing that &quot;Bessie Smith&quot; and their version of &quot;Ain't no more Cane&quot; are maybe the most beatiful thing they recorded. could've been a wonderful single.

B000001GH9|5.0|Sometimes it takes going to a live performance of a work that is familiar to you on recording to make you revisit an old friend with renewed passion.  So it was after hearing the astonishingly fine young violinist Jennifer Frautschi collaborate with Pierre Boulez and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in the Berg Viloin Concerto that I returned to this brilliant recording of the Berg with Anne-Sophie Mutter, James Levine, and the Chicago Symphony to revive those moments.  And once again this recording seems definitive.  Berg's Requiem work is knowingly and lovingly performed with a richness of tone and technique that erases all of the seeming hurdles of atonal writing and delivers a wrenchingly passionate farewell work. The other joy of this particular recording is the coupling of Wolfgang Rihm's &quot;Time Chant&quot; which he wrote for violinist Mutter.  This lyrically transcendent piece is evocative of the best of Messian and more than any other violin work to my knowledge succeeds in creating the illusion that the violin is a human voice, singing over a murmuring, pensive orchestral obbligato.  Mutter masters this and the result is hair-raisingly beautiful.  This is a very solid and very beautiful recording - and one that even the most harsh critic of atonal and contemporary music will succomb to in time.

B0000214F0|3.0|Any book or film purporting to examine the life of the Roman Emperor Gaius (Caligula) must necessarily look deep into a tormented soul. Caligula (which means \\"Little Boots,\\" a nickname the future emperor picked up in the army camp of his famous father Germanicus) ruled for a mere four years, from 37 to 41 AD, but managed to alienate almost every member of the Roman government during that time. What we do know about Caligula, which is actually very little, comes from Suetonius, a historian in the employ of the Emperor Hadrian nearly 100 years after Caligula's reign. Suetonius paints a picture of an insane tyrant, a power mad figure that murdered, tortured, tormented, and flaunted his unlimited power over the Roman Empire until his brutal assassination. Unfortunately, the historian Tacitus's treatment of Caligula's reign was lost to the ages long ago, leaving us with little else to go on concerning this interesting man from eons ago.<br />In the 1970's, Bob Guccione, the publisher of Penthouse magazine, got together with writer Gore Vidal and film director Tinto Brass to create a film version of Caligula's life. This film was not going to be a whitewash, but an attempt to create a version of life in Rome true to the historical accounts, a movie unflinching in its portrayal of the violence and decadence of that ancient empire. There are various cuts of \\"Caligula\\" floating around in video store limbo, but the unrated version is the one you need to get in order to see all of the ubiquitous grotesqueness. An added extra on the disc, a \\"making of\\" documentary about the film, is immensely interesting to watch because it shows you the beginning of the controversy that eventually plagued the film. According to this behind the scenes footage, the original name of the film was \\"Gore Vidal's Caligula,\\" a title changed after Vidal's arguments with Brass and Guccione over some of the explicit content became irreconcilable. The interviews with the three principals reveal the beginnings of this argument. It is a nice for a film buff to see a record of this titanic clash of egos. Completely apart from the disagreements over the content of the film, this DVD extra does a great job of showing how the craftsmen made the excellent set pieces for this epic film.<br />As most people know, the film stars some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Sir John Gielgud as Nerva, Peter O'Toole as the Emperor Tiberius, Helen Mirren (kept on a strict leash, so to speak), and Malcolm McDowell as the deranged Caligula. Almost all of the stars distanced themselves from the movie after its release, probably due to Guccione and Brass's instance on inserting decidedly indecent scenes. While none of the stars appear in these explicit inserts, the repugnance of these images would send any mainstream actor shrieking for the door. In short, the film is pornographic and therefore potentially damaging to big name thespians.<br />Opinions about this movie tend to be polarized: some love the dramatic set pieces, the over the top acting by McDowell and O'Toole, and the atmosphere of a time long gone. Others see \\"Caligula\\" as total trash, full of bad acting, an overlong running time, and disgusting imagery. I think the response to this epic should lie somewhere in the middle, that McDowell does occasionally rise to grandeur in his depiction of this unsettled figure. At other times, his performance seems forced and grating. Witness his \\"crazy\\" laughter on the beach while the legions collect seashells. I laughed aloud at his pitiful attempt to portray a delusional madman in this scene. O'Toole and Gielgud do a good job with what they have to work with, and die off quickly enough to protect themselves from most of the critical backlash.<br />I enjoy films about the Roman Empire, with a few notable exceptions. The lessons learned about the dangers of unlimited power concentrated in the hands of one man should continue to serve as warnings for rulers throughout the ages. Ifthis film helps to teach that lesson, all to the better. I suspect it won't, though, because it is difficult to take \\"Caligula\\" seriously at times. I recommend reading Suetonius; his biographical sketches of emperors from Julius Caesar to Domitian provide a much more helpful account of power run amok than this film does. He also includes sordid details too outrageous for even this movie. Moreover, a reading of Suetonius's sketch on Caligula reveals some possible motives about why Caligula acted as he did, something the movie does not do as well. Give it a shot if you must, but be ready for gratuitous violence and highly charged eroticism. By the way, the picture quality leaves a lot to be desired. It is grainy at times and is not the best transfer job ever done for a film.this film helps to teach that lesson, all to the better.

0393057658|5.0|This book demonstrates that baseball is a game of strategy, off the field as well as on. It is a game where the little guy can still win out - if he has the smarts and can gain the competitive edge.  The book restores one's faith in the basic integrity of the game, and it must strike fear into the hearts of the George Steinbrenners of the world. As Michael Lewis so satisfyingly illustrates, baseball really is America's game, the game where the underdog can come out on top. This book, and Bill Lee's revisionist baseball history, The Little Red (Sox) Book have restored my faith in the sanctity of baseball.
B00004TRD8|4.0|Whem i think of sci-fi i usually think of good effects (The Fifth Element), decent actors (Kurt Russell, Stargate) and an odd story (The Fifth Element, Stargate). But T2 does the unthinkable by using all 3 of these qualities and blending them almost perfectly. And its a sequel (whats next? a good Burt Reynolds film!).<br /> Of course the effects are a littlke out of date by now and the stories been copied a thousand times (The Sherminator - Amnerican Pie for gods sake!)but the sheer class will never be redone.<br />Arnauld stays off the &quot;Sarah Conner?&quot; lines and even comes off life-like - pity hes playing a machine. Kudos to James Cameron for making this a more memorable affair than the originalk;although not as hard-hitting.<br />Any bad points? Not enough of Jason Patric's liquid metal effect and no character that measures up to Michael Biehns Kyle Reese of the original.<br />As you can see, the good points outway the bad and make this one of the best sci-fi ever.

This is early ninties cinema at its best add it to your collection yesterday, if not sooner.
B00000IMTE|5.0|The &quot;stinker&quot; is &quot;If You Don't Like Rock 'N' Roll,&quot; but the other cuts on the album make up for it... this album still deserves five stars.<br />That aside, this is a classic fantasy metal album (maybe even the first...?) that rocks me to my core. Kicking it off is &quot;Man On The Silver Mountain,&quot; which is one of the best songs on the album. It is built off of a signature Ritchie Blackmore guitar riff, and Dio's melody is awesome... it is immediately apparent that this record will be a great rock statement. Dio's melodic, but ferocious roar and dungeons-and-dragons lyrics perfectly match Blackmore's baroque musical stylings. The next song, &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; is one of my favorite Rainbow songs. It is a slow, bluesy number with an incredible, soulful guitar solo from Blackmore. &quot;Catch the Rainbow&quot; is the closest this album comes to an epic, at about six-and-a-half minutes. It has obvious influence from Pink Floyd, and this is a good thing! It is a very mellow, psychedelic song. &quot;The Temple of the King&quot; is probably the most mystical song on the album, with really weird but awesome lyrics from Ronnie James Dio.<br />My favorite song is the instrumental &quot;Still I'm Sad,&quot; which is a cover of the Yardbirds. I've never heard the Yardbirds' version, but it can't possibly come close to this, because this version blows me away. It is so dreamy and ethereal, but hard-rocking at the same time. Blackmore's soloing is incredible... maybe even his best on the album.<br />Blackmore's playing and Dio's singing are consistently awesome throughout the song, and they save songs like &quot;Snake Charmer&quot; and the Quatermass cover &quot;Black Sheep of the Family,&quot; which, based on songwriting alone, would fail in the hands of almost any other band. The other 3 musicians (bass, drums, keys) are fine, but certainly not exceptional. Blackmore and Dio are the real stars of the show.<br />People say this album has a stupid album cover... I completely disagree! I think it is one of the coolest album covers of all time! It tells you a little about what the music will be like... the castle represents the baroque, medieval themes, and the guitar shape represents the awesome hard rock that the music is based on. Rainbow's self-titled album, while not up to the standards of their next two studio efforts &quot;Rising&quot; and &quot;Long Live Rock 'N' Roll,&quot; is still one of the best metal releases of the 70's.

My kids of course loved it - but I have to admit that I truly enjoyed it too!!!  I recommend it to everyone...
B00005JKHP|2.0|This movie is too long with too many slow scenes in it. The later Star Trek movies are much better than this first one. This one nearly put me to sleep, it was so long and boring.
6300271285|4.0|This version of &quot;Little Shop of Horrors&quot; is a musical that is set in the 1950s. It stars Rick Moranis as Seymour, Steve Martin as the crazy dentist, Bill Murray as the pain-loving patient (he was hilarious in this film!), and several other stars, plus a 3 black female group who sings doo-wop songs in the background. Also stars Levi Stubbs as the voice of the talking man-eating plant in the movie.<BR>   I was surprised that Rick Moranis sang really well in this movie! Ellen Green's character, who's the love interest of Seymour and dated the crazy dentist, has a very annoying voice....almost too squeaky. I can understand why people said her voice drove them up the wall! LOL My favorite scene was with the crazy dentist named Orin (Steve Martin) and the pain-loving patient (Bill Murray)...when Bill looks like he really enjoyed the experience and his facial expressions in the dental chair made me laugh. I also like the scene where Bill was telling this young patient that just had a contraption stuck on his face around the mouth area that he is &quot;very very lucky&quot; and this poor kid's in pain.<BR>   I have a couple of favorite tunes in this movie too. It's good to watch for a rainy day, if you are really interested in musicals and humor mixed together.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of Ellen Green's character, although she did well, her voice kind of ruin the scenes because it was so squeaky.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Quite simply an amazing album, i first heard audioslave on tv showing their music video of 'Like A Stone' and i was amazed i had never heard them before so i rushed to the shopping center and bought the album and believe me i was not disapointed. Actually i was amazed at the depth that each track has, and i have to say Chris Cornell has an amazing voice and i plan 2 get the Soundgarden albums as soon as possible
B000002HMH|4.0|You know, Its absolutely mind boggling how closed minded and un-appreciative people can be. Metallica, a band where in the beginning had such a solid fan base, and come the black album a portion seemed to just turn their back and never look back. As I will say and other metallica fans have, metallica evolved and will continue to do so. One if not the main objective with any band should be to try and go onto new and different musical territories with every album that comes out. As a fairly new metallica fan, and an ever growing one I like both new and old metallica. Although I do consider the old material to have a more...well timeless value to it. <BR>After 1991's the black album metallica took a five-year hiatus from releasing any new studio material. People grew suspicious and a backlash occurred when load hit in 1996. Where the black album came into metallica's evolution, they were no longer a thrash metal band, but a very well rounded hard rock band. <br />It is my opinion and belief and contrary to a popular one that load caught metallica at their most versile musical point yet. Hetfeild had a very good vocal range, Newsted's bass was more vibrant than even and show's very interesting bass riffs in such tunes as \\"king nothing\\" and \\"until it sleeps\\", Lars's drumming has a better range and Hammet's guitar playing was and is ever evolving. The point is people, bands change, metallica changed. By when they released this album they were well into there mid 30's and it's illogical a band would not musically change in that instance. Unfortunately, metallica at the point of load's release were dammed if they did, and they were dammed if they didn't.<br />Load, in my opinion is much more diverse and show's metallica can do much more than thrash metal (and I am partial to thrash) and mix blues, hard rock, and alternative into a very solid album. The only problem is that load and re-load despite having great tunes also had their share of filler, songs like \\"cure\\" and \\"poor twisted me\\" are examples. Odd enough, re-load had twice as much filler. Songs like \\"the house that jack built\\" , \\"until it sleeps\\" , \\"Bleeding me\\" and \\"Ronnie\\" with it's led zeppelingish vibe.
B00005MAM2|2.0|Akira. The title that has introduced oh so many Americans to the world of anime. One of the single most popular anime movies ever, and is renowned to being one of \\"the best\\". The only thing I have to say is \\"WHY?\\" <BR>Akira is the perfect example of something that should not be an anime movie. Katsushiro Otomo's 2000 page epic of a manga title is supposed to be rich with character development, story, and filled with taut, gripping emotion. This film is not, and while I have never read the Akira manga myself, I can almost guarentee that this film does not do the manga justice. <br />Akira takes place about 30 years after World War III, where the world is desolate wasteland. Gangs rule the streets, and one of them contains two childhood friends, Kaneda and Tetsuo. Tetsuo is a very typical character, one who is a little wimpier than the rest of the gang. However, Tetsuo also has telepathic powers, and the government seeks them. Tetsuo could be the key to the end of the world, and he doesn't even know it. <br />Later in the film, Tetsuo's power grows to dangerous levels, and he loses control of them.This is when it would benefit to read the manga in my opinion. The plot gets extremely abstract, and makes little to no sense. <br />All in all, Akira is a decent film. I would have to rate it about a 5 out of a possible ten. While it has potential as a film, I would have loved it to be a TV series or OVA. While it may be a great manga with a great, profound story, the movie is an unexcusable trainwreck of a story, especially toward the end. Many more films have tried to take the same story as Akira, such as Ghost in the Shell, and succeed, at least to me.
0671027344|5.0|I should probably dock this book some points for being a ripoff of Catcher In The Rye, but I really can't. Chbosky is so aware of the parallels in the books that it's more like a modernization than anything. I've read this book about 14 times. The first time I read this book was right before freshman year, and the last time I read it was right before graduation. Charlie and friends are painted so tangibly that you can almost picture yourself showing up at the Big Boy after a showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and hanging out with them. I think that if you like the musical RENT, you'll really enjoy this book. It's very similar in that it is a detailed account describing scattered parts of a year in the life of an interesting group of friends. Buy/read this immediately.
B000069CWE|1.0|In between touring and another studio album, Linkin Park decided to go for something different with this album.  Reanimation is basically remixes of all the songs on their multi-platinum debut album, Hybrid Theory, albeit with unusual names like ENTH E ND, with a few remixed unreleased and transition tracks thrown in.<BR>However, the rap/rockers make a huge mistake in handing over their songs to DJs besides their own Mike Shinoda and Joseph Hahn.  The songs on their debut album sounded cool because of the artificial beat behind all the metal-ish rock, but on Reanimation the new DJs have added so many beats and other odd stuff that it ends up muddying up the soaring raw guitar choruses and primal screaming vocals that the band has come to be known for.  In effect, Reanimation kills the songs.  <BR>The few tracks where Shinoda and Hahn remain the DJs are the few spots where this album is actually worth listening to.  There are a few added lyrics in some of the songs, like P5HING ME A*WY, the remix of Hybrid Theory's Pushing Me Away, that are pretty cool.  I gave this album 1 star because it is one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made.  If you have Hybrid Theory, be content with that album.  Those songs are very much alive.

B000089RVX|1.0|How is it that people can compare Evanescence to Linkin Park? Linkin Park has WAY more talent than these posers would ever have. Hell, this isn't even 'goth'! It's completely POP. THe singer's voice is horrible; it's whiny and annoying.
B000089RVX|4.0|As a classically trained musician, I was intrigued by the opening sections of &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; on my local rock station.  After hearing &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; numerous times, I decided to purchase the album - it is indeed an album worthy of purchase.  I enjoyed the fusion of driving rhythms, distorted guitar and soaring vocals.  Amy Lee has a sound that belies her age.  Unlike most albums, most of the tracks have an appeal all their own - whether you like pensive or in-your-face.  I also enjoyed the harmonic changes as well as the orchestration of the disc.  I hope to hear more from this quartet.
1587990717|2.0|I initially enjoyed reading the book although I was irritated by Taleb`s persistent egoistic writing style (without a track record to back it up),and disagreed with some of his core views that showed a lack of understanding of probabilities.In fact,I was more disappointed after watching his interview describing rare events,the man behind the curtain and for criticizing &quot;triumph of the optimists&quot; for not taking into account survivorship bias.His comments gave away his superficial understanding of statistics,probabilities and his inability of deep critical thinking since &quot;triumph of the optimists&quot;is the only book I know that took into account that specific phenomenon.Mr.Taleb,if you took the time to analyze further,you`d have discovered that the authors used historical newspapers for the data used in their<BR>research,so no survivorship bias of any kind was involved.<BR>After watching the interview,I reread the book and was able to point to more flaws than I did the first time.<BR>For instance,his implications that Niederhoffer is one of the lucky fools or that Jim Rogers doesn`t understand the role of chance since he never buys options were not well researched and explained.In fact,I have both of these fellows` books.The former is one of the top books I read,well researched with enough data to back every assertion.While,like fooled by randomness, the book criticizes all the popular methods of trading,unlike fooled by randomness,it has data to back up the criticism; and unlike fooled by randomness gives the alternative in the second part.<BR>The other book while not as deep as Niederhoffer`s,is definitely more entertaining than Mr.Taleb`s open ended randomness theory.<BR>Which brings me to the second part of the criticism of fooled by randomness...&quot;the I don`t know part&quot;.<BR>While Mr.Taleb qualitatively described randomness, admittedly in an entertaining way,that even I was initially fooled by the amount of non founded, random,qualitativeobservations in the book,he still didn`t give an answer as to how you can account for its existence in your life.His answer came on a later chapter &quot;I DON`T KNOW&quot;.<BR>I am wondering if Mr.Taleb used the same &quot;I DON`T KNOW&quot; logic for his PHD thesis on randomness.<BR>Overall there are better books on the phenomenon of randomness and statistics out there.<BR>The book is definitely more entretaining than most books on technical and fundamental analysis,however it lacks the deep understanding of the very phenomenon it tries to treat.

0151008116|5.0|\\"This novel was born as I was hungry,\\" says the opening line of Yann Martel's the Life of Pi. And, indeed, this is a novel about hunger. Hunger found in the stomach of its main character, Pi Patel who is stranded in a life boat after the ship he was travelling upon sinks into the Pacific; and hunger in the form of the Bengal Tiger that is trapped with him. It is about spiritual hunger as Pi's zest for life and religion leads him to become a practicing Muslim, Hindu, and Christian. And it is about the hunger for stories.<br />Like the fictional author of the book, the adult Pi, too, hungers for stories. The house in Canada from where he relates the details of his boyhood adventure is filled with religious symbols and trinkets so that one gets the sense that it is a home brimming with tales ready to be told. But to paraphrase what Pi says of the Christian religion, this novel has but one story. All the stories coming before it are merely a prologue. And this one story only takes on its complete horrifying, yet life-affirming and spiritual eloquence in the final few pages, long after the reader feels the tale has reached its conclusion.<br />Perhaps the most refreshing thing about Life of Piis its readability, its capacity to capture the reader from the outset and hold on page after page until the end. It is so rare that novels that have garnered the critical praise that the Life of Pi has received are as easy to read as a Stephen King yarn. But Martel has accomplished just that. His prose lures the reader into Pi's story with the ease of a skilled fisherman, and tightens the line at just the right time so that it is impossible to let go. The reader has no choice but to give in to the struggle and be led through the exquisite pain of Pi's ordeal willingly, craving for more, but not wishing to reach the end.<br />Martel achieves this accomplishment through two very clever devices. He creates a character that is impossible not to love, and weaves the subtle details, thatmake the story believable, subtly into the context of the plot.<br />From the opening descriptions of Pi's academic studies in Religion and Zoology, and his strange attachment for Richard Parker whom he seems to miss greatly, through his adventures at his family's zoo in India, to the stark, minimal existence of his days aboard a life boat, Pi is an immeasurably loveable character. We feel for him when he breaks his vegetarian existence, and share his horror upon discovering that what appears to be his salvation is actually a danger more voracious than the perils of the sea. He is such a gentle, loving person that when we approach the end of the novel we honestly don't believe this young, pacifistic young man is capable of committing even the slightest atrocity.<br />Martel also pulls us in with the details of his characters, so finely integrated into the story that the has no hesitation to believe it is possible for young Pi to survive aboard the lifeboat with Richard Parker, the Bengal Tiger. Even the name Richard Parker conjures up familiar images of Poe's character and the alleged real life cabin boy who was devoured by his crew mates. Pi's understanding of and compassion for animals stems from his upbringing. His knowledge of the details of lion training, their habits in the wild, and their biology come to him so naturally that we accept them at face value.<br />Martel knows that stories of man against the sea have existed since the dawn of civilisation, from ancient myth down through the years until the such products as the hit Tom Hanks film a few years back. We have a strange Oedipus complex with the ocean. It gave us birth and we are attached to it, yet we are continually aware of its temper and ability to deliver harsh punishments upon us. It is the ultimate metaphor for nearly anything an author wishes, forever constant and immortal, yet in a perpetual state of change. And Martel uses this natural metaphor to its full effect.<br />But despite Life of Pi's façade as a novel of high adventure at sea, it is ultimately a profoundly psychological novel. It is at once a modern Robinson Crusoe and a contemporary Heart of Darkness. Through Pi's story we are brought into the belly of the whale with the depths of its darkness, and back out again into the light. This is a novel that makes us profoundly aware of the beast that lives within us all.
B00006AW2M|5.0|Okay, so &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot; isn't among the greatest Rolling Stones albums ever, but that doesn't mean it's not a great album. Every song has something going for it, and it's the only one in which the band really succeeded in being innovative.<br />The album, originally titled &quot;Cosmic Christmas&quot;, features ten excellent tracks that need some respect. &quot;In Another Land&quot; is Bill Wyman's song, sung in his nasal drone augmented by Mick and Faces singer Steve Marriott on the chorus. &quot;Sing This All Together&quot; kicks the album off smoothly, but it's the reprisal of the song (subtitled &quot;See What Happens&quot;) that is really great. It kicks off with pot party noises (finishing with Mick's classic &quot;Where's That Joint&quot; line), than goes off into a long, terrifying jam of loud guitars, fast drumming, tortured moaning, and screaming. About 7 minutes and 20-something seconds into the song, Mick goes off into that scary tone of voice that he uses, singing the chorus of &quot;Sing This All Together&quot;. The album finishes with with a mellotron playing an eerie version of &quot;We Wish You A Merry Christmas&quot; over static and ends with the Stones muttering something. At first you may not understand it, but if you listen to it on headphones, they are chanting &quot;we hate you, we hate you&quot;. &quot;She's A Rainbow&quot; changes the mood greatly, a bright and colorful love song of a girl who comes in colors. &quot;The Lantern&quot; kicks off with the tolling bells of Leicester Square and goes through a bonechilling, Satanic style order of love.&quot;2000 Man&quot; alternates between a midtempo acoustic folk jam and a Beatles-style rocker. &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; is the best song on the album, an innovative rocker with frantic drumming, spine-cracking piano, and Brian Jones' expertly played mellotron. Closing the album is &quot;On With The Show&quot;, a giddy number abou a club show. &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Requests&quot; ends with a frantic piano solo played expertly by Nicky Hopkins. All in all a great album.atanic Majesties Requests&quot; ends with a frantic piano solo played expertly by Nicky Hopkins. All in all a great album.
B000089RVX|2.0|Described at truly original and refreshing by some, I found myself somewhat disappointed.  Lead singer Amy Lee has been compared to Tori Amos, Sarah McLachlan, Shirley Manson and the Cranberries.  It sounded like a little bit stolen from each.  While some tracks are impressive and others catchy, the whole package does not fit together. It jumps from pop-punk to wispy ballads, while losing its overall meaning in the attempt to cross into too many genres.  The obvious influences from the likes of Tori Amos to Type O Negative are very apparent, but this PG rated nu-metal fails to make its mark with fans of either audience.  It is more suitably targeted to Linkin Park loving 16 year-olds that rage against the injustice of curfews, cliques and the overall angst in being a teenager. <br />While described as gothic, the only thing that is &quot;Gothic&quot; about it is the over abundance of eyeliner and black hair dye.  The point is, its been done before, and the whole Sarah Mclachlan meets Linkin Park makes this the most twisted and annoying nu-metal that I have heard to date.  Its very brazen in its approach, but in the long run, it ended up grating on my nerves because Amy Lee's vocals are beautiful but the lyrics made me alternate between bouts of laughter and nausea.  This is very hard to take with a straight face. The songs are campy, and the under lying them of Christianity is enough to make me want to throw the CD out my car window and run over it repeatedly.  The fact that this band will be around long enough to see its album go plantinum and then fall of the face of the earth is the only satisfying thought you can be left with.  The idea that the music industry again shows us that it feels the consumers are opinion-less scabs that need to be spoon-fed recycled concepts just adds insult to injury.  <BR> <BR> Overall, I like the influences more that the outcome that they have produced.  If you want the whispy ballad haunt factor, go pick up Garland by the Cocteau Twins, or for some real, sink your teeth into Goth Metal, try any album by Type O Negative, a band that is truly amazing, original and definately underappreciated.
0688163173|5.0|I honesty thought that I would never again read a book as breathtakingly good as Mystic River. Now I have. &quot;Shutter Island is simply brilliant. All I can say is Wow! I can't wait to see the movie.
B00005JLWN|3.0|EQUILIBRIUM is a difficult movie to review.  Although this film is a really good b-movie, with some nifty (if not borderline silly) action sequences and great concepts, there are plot holes-a-rama.  I can't help but like CHRISTIAN BALE whose movie status is becoming that of zen guru of the smaller sci-fi/horror genre of well made b-flicks, and here he shines as usual.  The entire idea of the Gramaton Cleric is pretty cool, and is executed in some inventive set peices that are remiders of THE MATRIX as much as they are not.  I think this film stands on its own being just different enough to be original.  The production design was good as well, usually movies with a smaller budget and advertising campaign end up looking like they were filmed on a soap set.  The director helps us view an antiseptic world as void of emotions as the characters within.  Enjoyable at face value; don't even try to bring up realistic implications about the storyline because there are so many lapses in logic.  TAYE DIGGS' character displays a wide range of emotions throughout the picture and he's suppose to be emotionless.  From minute one he wants BALE's job, is not that jealousy?  Well he does lose some face eventually.  This is one movie where style totally reigns over substance but somehow both intertwine to create a pretty decent film with cool gunplay and something to think about a least a few hours after the credits roll.
B000056K04|3.0|dave matthews band has always displayed sheer beauty and talent throughout their long lived carrer, but this CD is not up to their usual.  i would recommend 'under the table and dreaming' crash or another of the older cds, or if youre looking for some recent dave, then go with 'busted stuff'.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is about as exisential as Bladerunner & A.I. and has all the mindscrew of Minority Report.        Fantastic displays of hyper-kinetic gun-kata and the uber-cool visual combos of Bladerunner, The Fifth Element, & Metropolis aside, this movies delves into an area sci-fi doesn't go that much into anymore...psychology. Can we find the line of behavior to save ourselves from our most basic emotions without giving up what makes us human? And what are the prices of the extremes on either end of the spectrum? It shows how cold, lonely, bleak, & empty absoute emotional isolation & control can be, and how the world looks & feels as you experience it without inhibitors for the first time. This film in some cases does exceed the first Matrix movie, but keep in mind these are two TOTALLY different animals.            My only complaints are (1) I never saw this on the big screen. (2) There's no trailer, or DTS format on the DVD. Aside from that, Equilibium is an absolute, thought provoking gem of a  keeper.  ...and considering that all the major retail outlets in my area can't keep the dvd on the shelves for more than two days, says it all.

B00003CXE6|4.0|This story is set in ancient Rome around 180 A.D. Marcus Aurelius is the aging emperor and Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a great general who has won many battles. Marcus (Richard Harris) loves him like a son and more than his own son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Marcus intends to make Maximus emperor to be but Commodus kills Marcus before this be known. He works to destroy Maximus, but Maximus escapes and rides swiftly to his home where he finds his wife and son murdered. Overcome with grief and exhaustion, he lies unconcious on the ground and is later taken by slave traders and sold to a former gladiator (Oliver Reed)  and must fight in the arena as a gladiator if he wants to live. He lives only for revenge, to one day kill Commodus. Maximus and his pack of gladiators become well known and come to Rome to fight in the Coliseum. They defy incredible odds and utterly destroy a horde of gladiators in chariots. Maximus becomes the crowd's favorite. They chant his name in the arena. The scenes in the arena with the gladiators are quite grisly but are some of the best scenes in the movie.  Marcus's daughter loves Maximus and plots to destroy Commodus. Commodus is an evil man with evil deeds to his credit. He lusts after his sister and has spies to keep him well informed. Maximus gets his chance at revenge, Commodus doesn't want to make him a martyr.
0385504209|4.0|I found this book to be a quick and compelling read.  It is a murder mystery that links events in the novel back to early Christian church events in an unusual way.  If you are overly-senstive to controversial issues around Christianity this book may not be for you.  If you like to explore ideas surrounding the historical context of religion and art you may enjoy it as I did.  My only regret was that I was reading this on a plane, and I would have prefered to have internet access to examine some of the works of art that were being discussed as I was reading!
B000069HK2|4.0|To start out, I like this album.  What it lacks in complexity is made up by interesting song structure (which is complexity in itself, I suppose).  Anyway, this band clearly knows when and where to place things in song.  Take for example, &quot;On My Own&quot;, the vocalist's screams/growls over the string arrangement make for an incredible emotional experience.  Personally, this is true talent in music (placement) rather than complex solos and such..Anyway, this is an extremely fun album, that rocks hard...My only gripe..at times the vocalists screams/growls seem slightly weak,a minor gripe, but on certain tunes it takes away from the overall quality of the song...but, give it a try
B00000K19E|5.0|The Wachowski brothers have delivered an exciting movie, though not completely new - but knowntheless, good plot and \\"what is the real?\\" - and \\"Good vs Evil\\" theme.  It is amazing, with so much going on, that they are able to deliver, partly because of innovative filming, a concise and interesting movie.<br />Though some reviewers have critically \\"slamed\\" Keanu Reeves' acting ability, he is no doubt a perfect fit as he brillintly pulls off a confused, searching young man, trying to find his destiny.  His calling, like many people in real life, is mulled and contemplated.  In one instance, he is a messaih figure, more like \\"King David\\" than Christ, and in other instances, he is a superhero with extreme power.<br />Fishburne is perfect as Morpheous, the mentor and \\"minor prophet.\\"  Carrie Ann Moss, is compelling as Trinity, a high-flying...kickn' women who falls in love with Neo (Reeves).<br />I am not normally a \\"special effects\\" person, but I must admit, I found effects in this movie to be pure genius.  There was enough to WOW one, yet, not too much to take away from the movie.  One Amazon reviewer didn't like the martial arts scenes, but these mostly Kung Fu scenes are a perfect fit for this type of film.  Sure it isn't Bruce Lee, but for a bunch of actors, it is very well done.  Stunt doubles for fight sequences are kept to a minmium so the contnuity in the characters shows - a major plus.<br />The villians, Hugo Weaving and Joe Pantoliano are extremely good in their respective parts.  All in all, a masterful film from two young filmakers.

THERE IS NOT A LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN MINA HARKER AND COUNT DRACULA!<BR>Dracula is a vampire, a monster and Jonathan Harker is his ticket to ENGLAND. After the deed to his new estate is signed, Harker is a dead man left to Dracula's three vampire wives.<BR>In England Dracula gets Lucy and then Mina and Mina is the only link to Dracula because she is under his power and it is through her that Van Helsing and the other men can chase Dracula back to his Castle and destroy him. Forget the romance,Dracula is a horror story and perhaps one day will be done the way it was meant to be. As for now the closest thing to Stoker's novel is El Conde Dracula (Count Dracula) with Christopher Lee.

B00008VGL6|4.0|I love Depeche Mode. They are one of my favorite synth-pop bands. I will admit that I wasn't really planning on buying Martin Gore's solo album &quot;Counterfeit2&quot; but plans changed and I bought it. The first time I listened to the album I wasn't too sure what to make of it. The music is still dark and foreboding as Depeche Mode's music but maybe more mellow. I also didn't realize that the entire cd is cover songs. Although I would have appreciated original material from Martin, I had never heard the original versions of the songs Martin chose. So in essence, the cover songs could be considered 'new Martin Gore song' to me at elast. On &quot;Counterfeit2&quot;, Martin's vocals isn't overwhelmed by the synthesizers and other instruments like it would on a Depeche Mode. I could hear that the focus on the album is his vocals, not the synthesizers. I thought that &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; had a very gothic feel to the song, very dark and mellow. I love &quot;Stardust&quot;. It is definitely one of my favorite tracks on the cd. &quot;I Cast a Lonesome Shadow&quot; definitely shows the Depeche Mode influence. Through out the cd, I thought the music had a very jazzy feel to the music. It was as if Martin was singing torch songs. Very compelling album. I thought his choices in cover songs (as unknown to me as they were) were excellent. I guess the only flaw with this album is that it would have been nice that Martin did an album of original material. Otherwise I enjoyed this cd immensely.

B00002Z88D|5.0|The far majority of Metallica CD's are hit-or-miss songwise. Usually, there's a few songs that completely ROCK surrounded by clunkers that are pretty much a waste of time to listen to. This CD is different. Not only are the songs pretty much the best ever recorded by this band (the only true masterpieces that are missing are \\"Fade to Black,\\" \\"Creeping Death,\\" and \\"The Unforgiven,\\" and out of the three, \\"Fade to Black\\" is the only one that would really fit this sort of project), but they are backed up with an incredible orchestral arrangement. This adds greatly to the sense of power that the songs already try to convey... some of them even feel like a Wagner opera in their tone and intensity (\\"Call of Kthulu,\\" \\"One,\\" \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\"  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"). Overall, the music is incredible.<br />If you are new to Metallica, then I'd reccomend just getting this album and Ride the Lightning. While this album offers more of a broad look at Metallica's career and focuses heavily on harmony, it does NOT provide the pure emotional rush that Ride the Lightning does. Whatever the case, do not delay in somehow getting your hands on this.
B00004Y6NX|4.0|I would be one of the last to endorse throwback music based on pure nostalgia, but I find myself reaching for this CD when I least expect to and find I am unexpectedly surprised.<br />The strength of this work is really based on two songs...&quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and &quot;Skateaway.&quot;  Neither of which were bonafide top 40 hits to my knowledge.  I have listened to &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; for my fourth time tonight and it is a song that is not to be tired of.  &quot;and all I do is miss your and the way we used to be / all I do is keep the beat and bad company / all I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme / Julie I'd do the stars with you any time.&quot;  The song strikes the right balance of mood...blues, country, jazz, and poetry.  It's an all-time wonderful tune, to be sure.<br />And then there is the fun of &quot;Skateaway.&quot;  Skateaway was the closest to a hit catching MTV early day play time.  The song is less mood-inducing than &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; and more poppy, but not in a bad way.  It rolls along with the fun lyrics, &quot;she tortures taxi drivers just for fun / she like to read their lips / says toro toro taxi see ya tomorrow my son / I swear she let a big truck grease her hips.&quot;<br />This was before the overplayed Dire Straits days of &quot;Money for Nothing,&quot; and the only Dire Straits CD that holds my interest.  Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is impressive and catchy and holds a candle up to its influence...Nashville Blues.  He has played with the likes of Chet Atkins.  Not bad for a Brit when Brits usually pay homage to blues and not Nashville.  The rest of the album is pretty solid with &quot;Expresso Love,&quot; and &quot;Hand in Hand,&quot; being standouts on their own rights.  I disagree with other reviewers that the last song &quot;Les Boys,&quot; doesn't belong or is offensive.  To me, it gives some added interest, a little color, and lightness, played in vaudeville style.  A fun balance to the soul roller coaster of &quot;Making Movies.&quot;l roller coaster of &quot;Making Movies.&quot;

B000000643|5.0|For a folk band, this album displays a remarkable variety of interesting styles, from the catchy folk of Si Tu Dois Partir with its delightful fiddle, through the amazing guitar work that characterizes A Sailor's Life, through the energetic playing on Cajun Woman to the exquisite balladry of Sandy Denny on her moving and poetic song Who Knows Where The Time Goes. This must be the definite song on the themes of change and aging from a personal perspective, and a graceful, mature love song too. I also love Percy's Song, a fairly standard folk interpretation and the raucous singalong Million Dollar Bash. This music is at all times emotionally touching and truly timeless, lifted into greatness by Denny' voice and Richard Thompson's guitar playing.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Not being a big fan of low-fi garage rock, or Jack White's singing voice, I thought The White Stripes' last album was overrated.  I bought Elephant with reservations and was delighted to find a much stronger, groovier, and more musical album that retains the punk attitude of White Blood Cells but ups the songwriting, production and performance ante.<br />Jack White's frequently offkey, whiny singing sounds more polished on this record, doing much more singing than shouting, and it's a welcome change.  His voice is still more about attitude and urgency than body or finesse, but it just sounds so much better on Elephant.  But it's the songwriting and arrangement that really make this record shine:  The positively primordial riff to &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; stuck to my head for days, the 'Black Sabbath Vol. 4' guitar sludge of &quot;Black Math&quot; is aggressive and rocks out like a maniac, the cover of &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself&quot; outdoes Elvis Costello's version thanks to an unusually sensitive and soulful Jack White lead vocal, and &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; taps into the deep grooves of the best classic-rock bands.  There's a heavy Stones/Zeppelin vibe to this record that's highly suitable to the ragged soul of The White Stripes, hitting that groove which only blues and blues-based rock can muster.<br />A great record for the year, showing major progression for this band.
B0000584V3|5.0|While Opeth's \\"Blackwater Park\\" isn't the best cd i've<BR>ever heard, it certainly ranks among the top ten cd's of<BR>all time on my list.

B000059Z8J|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time a few days before Christmas in 1978, I was hooked. I was 14 years old. Now in 2003, this movie is even better on DVD. Although, I would prefer the director's cut I'm very happy with this edition.<br />We all know the story-I don't think it's neccescary going into details of the film. The added scenes are a plus. I think the little girl on the train(who turns out to be little Lois Lane)is a very significant scene. She sees superman run home from school and tries to tell her parents what she saw. A short but important scene-because it adds more drama to the romance later in the film.<br />I have a message for Warner Brothers: Put out the director's cut. I don't care how long the film is. I think that you should take full advantage of the capablties of the DVD format.<br />The 3 documentries provide a lot of insights on how the film was made.

He is telling people guns and violence is <BR>the answer. Hott beats might be what is getting u to buy this but temptation comes in many forms.  He cusses too much and<BR>is teaching violence like i said. If ur like me i dont wanna<BR>hear junk in songs.  Then at the end of his album, he has a song<BR>called \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven.\\" How is he gonna make it to heaven if he cusses and says guns and violence is the answer?  You cant make it to heaven like that, and dont know what christianity is.  If u want the same good sound and better lyrics I reccomend to these artist:<br />1.Krs-one<BR>2.Nuwine  ***Nuwine sounds like 2Pac***<BR>3.FTF ***Sound like Hot Boyz/Juvenille/Big Tymers<BR>4.LL Cool J (\\"10\\" is a great album.)<BR>5.Wyclef Jean
B0000025KI|5.0|These songs are no less than majestic, lyrically and melodically. The singing and playing are equally impressive and convey the various moods of the album so well. The ecstasy, the joy and the sadness of life are captured here with an honesty very rarely matched in the annals of rock. The Ties That Bind, Sherry Darling and Hungry Heart are passionate rockers, while Independence Day is a mournful ballad full of reminiscences and regret. Point Black is a slow ballad, whilst Cadillac Ranch and I'm A Rocker are blistering slabs of energetic rock. Fade Away is a slow and anguished rock ballad with beautiful piano work and a stirring arrangement, while the sad and fragile Stolen Car almost sounds like something from Nebraska. Traditional rock `n roll rears its pulsating head on Ramrod, while the next three songs all have cars and driving as their theme: The Price You Pay is sombre and melancholic, Drive All Night is sad and soulful, and this masterpiece of an album concludes with the sorrowful Wreck On The Highway, one of Springsteen's most moving songs. In its dignified resignation, acceptance and the renewed appreciation for loved ones that it inspires, it reminds me of Lou Reed's The Bed on [[ASIN:B00000637V Berlin]] or Song For My Father by [[ASIN:B00000I8MI Angels of Light]]. This album is so great, it's almost too much to digest in one uninterrupted session.
0451207521|4.0|It seems like Jackdaws is the first book I've read by Follett where the center of the story is WWII. Although I have not read many novels regarding this subject matter I will say that I was very impressed at the objective viewpoint the author had on the war. His characters are not merely good and evil; they are human beings in a war fighting for their lives. The people are doing what they think is necessary to win the war and thus end the war. Each character displays the true human quality that we all have about the natural hate for war.<br />The story is about a Female British Spy named Flick, whose job it is to cripple the communications link between Germany's Rommel and the German forces in occupied France. Without this communications link the occupation would need to route messages by courier thus making it impossible to properly communicate orders, as they need to be given. Flick and her British Superiors have come up with a plan to infiltrate the central communication link in France. The only thing stopping her from severing this link is a determined German operative named Dieter Franck.<br />The beginning grips you with an intense situation in which the British spy is on a clandestine team of spies carrying out a special operation against the Germans communication facility. Present is the handsome Franck who happens to be in the area checking up on German security. From that moment on the two are mingled in a cat and mouse game not so typical of the WWII spy-thriller genre. <br />I recommend reading this book if you are interested in the events leading up to D-day. And have enjoyed Follett's work in the past.<br />Although the reviews make it seem like a book about a bunch of British Female Spies, I tend to disagree. In my opinion the book was mostly focused on the aforementioned characters. Although 5 women accompany Flick, it's evident that she is the story's Protagonist and Franck the Antagonist.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Do you believe in love?  Fate?  That everything happens for a reason?  Astrology?  Premonitions?  Near misses of should-of-beens?  Well, neither do I.  However, this film is full of ALL of these things and come to find out the story is delightful!<br />John Cusack is a way-cool actor.  He always plays the type of guy you want to root for to prevail in some off-the-wall struggle.  Kate Beckinsale is nothing short of gorgeous and her British accent is a charming ingredient of this comical look at a love-story-gone-awry.<br />Cuscack &amp; Beckinsale play a couple of New Yorkers who &quot;accidently&quot; meet up one night.  Turns out, they REALLY hit it off.  Due to a sequence of unlikely events, they are separated and go their separate ways.<br />A few years later both are supposed to be married - almost on the same day.  Only problem is (you guessed it) by now they're supposed to marry different people.  At the eleventh hour both start having second thoughts and begin having reveries about their one enchanting evening together.<br />The balance of the story traces their attempts to get back in touch with each other while their friends believe they've gone looney.  The result is what is quite possibly the funnest &amp; sweetest Romantic Comedy since WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING.<br />If you have a date tonight, I would SERIOUSLY recommend this film.  If you don't have a date tonight, find one &amp; then watch it together.  As a last resort, watch it by yourself.  Remember:  everything happens for a reason!  OK, OK, maybe it doesn't - but that doesn't mean you shouldn't buy this DVD!
6305342768|3.0|Trying to duplicate the success of the studio's landmark &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot;, Disney embarked on a journey to the stars in search of an enigmatic black hole.  Great state-of-the-art special effects are the main attraction while good actors are burdened with some rather stilted dialogue and a, forgive the pun, &quot;hole-ridden&quot; plot.  It's a shame that Schell, Borgnine, and Perkins have to suffer through such jargon, but they, along with the other cast members, manage to survive. And Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens provide voices to what may be two of the worst excuses for robots ever put to film.<br />John Barry's score has its moments of granduer, especially the opening theme, but the battle scenes music is almost laughable as a try at the John Williams's &quot;Star Wars&quot; arena.  Barry has done much better.<br />The ending is highly unsatisfactory, confusingly blending the scientific and the religious.  Like others have said, this strange attempt at trekking into &quot;2001&quot; territory fails.<br />Still, the film is for fans of the genre, of which I AM one, and I can recommend it solely on that note.
B000002NBY|5.0|This seamless blend of African pop and American folk styles is one of the most exquisite musical achievements of the 20th century. The melodies are exquisite and each and every one of the tracks is a classic. The best loved songs include The Boy In The Bubble, Graceland, Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes and Under African Skies, but the rest hold great charm too. The most rootsy African sounds surface on I Know What I Know with the soulful vocal infusions of The Gaza Sisters. Paul Simon has always successfully integrated exotic sounds in his music to create great beauty: Andean flutes in El Condor Pasa, reggae in Me And Julio Down By The School Yard and in Mother &amp; Child Reunion, and Latin/South American sounds in Rhythm Of The Saints, but Graceland is his towering achievement as a solo artist, a truly exceptional album with a power and beauty that transcends all musical boundaries.

0517548232|4.0|This is an excellent book that is easy to follow and understand. The one lesson is very simple: explore all the consequences of policies and actions, including not only short-term and long-term consequences, but also what actions cannot be done as a consequence of a initial policy or action (e.g. If you spend money on A, you cannot spend the same money on B -- or another way of saying you cannot eat your cake and have it too). Basically, the lesson is to be thorough in analysis of actions and policies. Mr. Hazlitt applies this lesson to a series of economic issues.<br />It should be noted that many of the ideas in the book come from an 1850 essay by Frederick Bastiat, \\"What is Seen and What is Unseen\\".<br />Using his lesson of thorough analysis, Mr. Hazlitt illustrates of how rent-control can lead to housing shortages, minimum-wage laws can lead to fewer jobs, and tariffs can lead to higher consumer prices. What is SEEN is the benefit to a special group (those in rent-controlled apartments, those with the jobs, or those receiving the protection of the tariff), but what is UNSEEN is the harm done to other groups (those that don't get the benefit of new housing, those who don't get jobs, and those who have to pay higher prices).<br />My criticism of the book is that there is an ENORMOUS OMISSION. After examining so many topics, Mr. Hazlitt fails to even bring up the government intervention that has had the greatest impact on our economic and political lives (for good and evil), the CORPORATION. Corporations are the biggest influences in our political campaigns, the recipients of the many of the benefits of tariffs and subsidies, and are the focus of many of the regulations of our government.<br />Mr. Hazlitt's book at least gives us the tools to look at the issue of the corporation. <br />Corporations have three qualities that are different from other business types: limited liability, personhood, and the perpetual life. I will get you started with the analysis of limited liability.<br />Limited liability means that an owner or stockholder cannot lose than he or she has paid for the shares of ownership regardless of the firm's debts.<br />Limited liability cannot be created by a free-market. What is SEEN is that limited liability shields investors from risk, but what is UNSEEN is that the risk is transferred to the other parties, or stakeholders. To some of the stakeholders the acceptance of the risk is an implied contract; employees, creditors, suppliers and customers should aware that by doing business with a corporation they are taking on the risk of the results of actions done in the names of the owners (most corporation special-interest advocates label this government intervention as \\"efficiency\\"). However, there is no implied contract with third parties (tort victims). If a corporation goes out of business owing money to third parties no one is held responsible, not owners, not managers. Limited Liability is government granted limited responsibility, or legalized irresponsibility. Government has transferred risks, and the associated costs without the associated benefits, to third parties.<br />I urge all readers to use Mr. Hazlitt's method to answer, at least, the questions below.<BR>What are the short-term and long-term impacts of Limited Liability on each stakeholder -- investors, managers, employees, suppliers, creditors, and THIRD PARTIES (tort victims), competitors, citizens etc...? What is the impact on competition? How does limited liability change financial markets? How does limited liability relate to the size of organizations? What are the implications of limited liability to the different types of market failures such as Moral Hazard, Rent Seeking, and Market Control? What are the implications for the Principle-Agent problem? What do the large resources gained by means of limited liability mean in a court case where a corporation in matched against a tort victim or any individual? How does all this relate to problems like Superfund sites and asbestos claims? In general, who are the special interest groups that benefit and how do they emphasize the benefits of limited liability without mentioning the costs? In general, who are the groups that are hurt?<br />Now, what are the implications of corporate personhood?<br />There are a few other shortcomings in the book, but still it is a great exercise in thinking through ideas.<br />Cheers.

B000002AT6|5.0|As a devoted collector of film scores, I am confident in saying that if you purchase one dramatic symphonic motion picture score, it ought rightly to be Horner's Legends of the Fall.  Despite the musings of some jaded critics who seem determined to reduce this work through systematic over-analyzation and comparison, the score is itself nothing short of breathtaking.  With a richness of sound and a purity of passion, Horner's score will fill your mind and your heart with a wondrous sense of human emotion and a reflection of nature's grandeur.  From the mysterious, earthly sounds of the opening track through the full emotional explosion of the main theme, Legends never disappoints.  The score reaches a highpoint in the track \\"Off to War\\" in which the main theme bursts forth with such graceful magnificence and with such soul-stirring breadth that even the most casual listener could be reduced to tears.  Legends of the Fall will capture your heart and fill your soul with a deep sense of tragedy, compassion, magnificence and frailty.  There simply is not a more stirring film score in existence.
B000002UAO|5.0|When you think of classic Beatles albums, you often think Abbey Road, Sgt Pepper, Revolver or The White Album. But Rubber Soul deserves it's place right up there with those albums. It is often overlooked or forgotten, but is a necessary step between early Beatles recordings (\\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\") and the later-day masterpieces (\\"Getting Better\\",\\"Revolution\\", \\"Come Together\\", \\"Let It Be\\").<BR>Rubber Soul opens with the peppy \\"Drive My Car\\", a John & Paul harmony that is often forgotten among the great Beatles tunes. This one blends their voices so perfectly, it's easy to see why these two worked so well together. John's \\"Norwegian Wood\\" is next, a Dylan-esque folk tune about a whimsical one-night stand (Original lyrics were \\"Knowing she would\\", but were changed to the less offending \\"Nowegian Wood\\"). George plays an absolutely gorgeous sitar on this song- definitely overlooked. Paul's \\"You Won't See Me\\" is next, occasional 3-part harmony (with John & George), but admittedly one of their lighter works. John's \\"Nowhere Man\\" was written about his father, a forebearing to some of his most introspective and revealing songs that he'd write for his 1st solo album in 1970. One of the Beatles all-time greats and again, great 3-part harmony. How could you NOT love this song?<BR>\\"Think For Yourself\\" may be George Harrison's greatest song next to \\"Something\\". The guitar work is 1st rate of course, but the singing and lyrics are also top-notch. Giving John & Paul a run for their songwriting money!!! \\"The Word\\" is one of those '60's era songs that must have seemed like a good idea at the time but hasn't really stood the test of time. Still, a lesser Beatles song is still miles ahead of most other songs. \\"Michelle\\" is a Paul McCartney masterpiece that everybody knows, even if you're not a fan. \\"What Goes On\\" gives Ringo Starr a chance in front of the microphone and he does well in this country-western style song, with backup from John & Paul. \\"I'm Looking Through You\\" is one of thosesongs that catches your attention the very first time you hear it and you love it forever. It's Paul's song, with John singing backup and Ringo playing the organ! <BR>\\"Girl\\" & \\"In My Life\\" are absolutely beautiful John Lennon masterpieces that make your heart ache in light of what ultimately happened to John. Especially \\"In My Life\\", which finds John in a retrospective mood and singing about all the things he'll remember all his life. Absolutely wonderful song and worth the price of this CD alone! \\"If I Needed Someone\\" is another top-notch George Harrison composition and probably ranks third of all his songs, behind the aforementioned \\"Something\\" (from the album Revolver) and \\"Think For Yourself\\".<BR>The closing song \\"Run For Your Life\\" is a throw-away tune that John wrote in about 5 minutes, one that he admitted that he never really liked, but the 3-part harmony is wonderful and the song structure is first class. The lyrics may be a tad below the Lennon-McCartney standard that we're used to, but still a fine tune nonetheless. The one song that I'd say doesn't belong, and in fact was actually written in the summer of '65 for the \\"Help\\" film, is \\"Wait\\", a sophmoric effort that probably was better left on the cutting room floor. Still, only one song that is somewhat poor out of an album of 14 songs is incredible!<BR>I'd highly recommend this disc, especially if you're only familiar with the Beatles \\"hits\\" and are looking for something a little different. The craftmanship of these songs has stood up over 38 years and remains as remarkable today as ever. From 2 and 3 part harmony to excellent guitar work and songwriting, this is a forgotten classic that you will be delighted to discover (or re-discover!!!). Buy this CD, you'll love it!!!

B00007L4MJ|5.0|I have seen many of the versions of this movie. This current restoration work is by far the best. Included are scenes that I have never seen before, as well as the insertion of story lines of parts of the movie were irretrievably lost. This aided in making the storyline more complete. I especially enjoyed the commentary version included on the disc. The description of how the fastastic special effects used in turning the robot into Maria were phenominal for its day. The quality of film restoration for this movie is superlative. This DVD version is the best out so far. I cannot imagine anyone surpassing this edition.

B00000K19E|5.0|This movie caught my eye after its theatrical release.  As a sci-fi/action film goes...this one is evertyhing you could want.  Action, cool clothes, over-the-top good guys and villians and a great sountrack. If there was a slow part, I guess the first 15-20 minutes, which is the character establishment phase which is a necessity on a film like this.  One after you know what this &quot;Matrix&quot; is does it really kicks into high gear.  This is a film that I enjoy watching over and over.  My only regret is that I didn't see this on the big screen.  Maybe someday.  I hope to see Reloaded on an IMAX screen since it is being converted to that and being release around the end of May or so.  Matrix is a strong buy!

I just love Becky  Bloomwood, she made me laugh with all the things she was getting herself into, Even though I am not a Shopaholic Becky makes you feel what she is feeling about maxing her criedt cards and how crazy she felt with hoping to win the lottery and thinking her numbers would come up how many times have we said we are going to win the lottery our numbers are going to come up and when they don't we think something is wrong with the lotto machine and then we try to find some other way to make money. I am telling you I could not stop laughing if you want a good laugh I highly recommend this book or you want to read a really good book, you won't be disppointed, now I can't wait to Shopaholic Takes Manhattan so that I can continue reading about Becky and Luke.<br />Happy Reading Lisa
B0000019PA|5.0|aeroplane over the sea is smeared with perfection. it takes through nursery school, playgrounds, bottlerockets, distant parents, death, bedrooms, spinal chords. musically it is nothing close to simple with layer upon layer of energetic and home-feeling sounds. however, guitar is definately dominant along with vocals that are so earnestly delivered it is hard to not want to call Jeff up and give him a hug over the phone. please just listen to this cd. two headed boy might be the most amazing song i have ever heard. this ranks up there with the smiths - queen is dead, beach boys - pet sounds, and joni mitchell - blue.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Would have give 2 1/2 stars if offered.  The story started off with a coup from the Remans, the race that has only been ever so briefly mentioned of in the Star Trek universe.  I found it a very unlikley plot to have a human of any type...even Picards clone to take over the Romulan Empire. The Romulan Star Empire was never written in Star Trek to be this weak.  They had a wonderful underground story established in the TNG series with Spock helping out that a civil war would have made more sense. Spock woulldn't had to even be in this series. Perhaps just some references of his work.<br />I was also very dissapointed at how little a on screen time that Beverly Crusher, Riker, and Worf and Troi had.  First Contact clearly proved that quality time could be allocated if a good <BR>producer/director were running thinngs.<br />The film was riddled with inconsistencies.  How B4 come about is weak at very best.  Wesley's appearance in a Starfleet unform is ridiculous if you knew under the terms he left (he nearly started a war with the cardassians and left with the traveler and basically told Picard to stuff it). Picard did have hair in his youth. There are several more but I have said enough.  Add it to your collection to complete your set, but a good rental will cover it.
0738206679|5.0|For casual readers, this book is a wonderful book to spawn new ideas of networks and networking.  Although the latter half is weaker in my perspective, I think this is a great book and has contributed greatly to my understanding of how certain things can be linked together and how certain connections can make the passage of information or the ability to do something more effective.  A great book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|A few months before Norah Jones wining Grammy Awards, her CD was recommended by a music stall on our campus bazaar and I enjoyed it very much.  She certainly deserves the awards given to her as she sings so skillfully and uniquely, essentially making the CD a captivating one for many music listeners, of jazz, pop songs, or any kind of other categories.<br />Among the 14 tracks inside the CD, Dont Know Why and Come Away with Me are definitely excellent ones.  However, I receive satisfaction of no less degree from Cold Cold Heart, Feelin the Same Way, and Turn Me On.<br />There is no doubt about her voice that is sweet and smoky.  There is no doubt about her talent and skill that can bring fresh life to all songs.  The combination of her voice and skills is what makes us willing to go and stay together her in her music world.  If we could wish more, we wish that the passage of time will further enrich the depth of her voice and that she will have more albums to come.
0226264017|5.0|I found this book to be excellent.  The strongest part of this book is the connection between the liberty to choose what one wants to purchase and the consequent political freedom that entails.  I also enjoyed the concept that economic power spread throughout all classes (ie, wealth) is a form of political power and therefore a protection against the power and tyranny of government.  There are some areas I did not quite understand (eg, the sections on banking), but I did largely agree with the arguments of all sections I did understand.  (I'm not an economist.) An excellent read for understanding America and any other capitalist country and the interplay between liberties and capitalism.

1577311523|5.0|This book is a fun, philosophical, and eclectic blend of religions and philosophies on the good life.  If you are torn apart emotionally, need something refreshing to awaken your senses to what life really offers, and/or have been unsatisfied with the effects of counseling, church, and all other conventional ways of seeking satisfaction or consistent acceptance of yourself--then I would recommend this book. (Although I have never had counseling and went into reading this book perfectly satisfied with myslef, but wanted to see if the book offered any new vision--which it does.)  I would have to say the author seems to me a bit of an eccentric/visionary (in the sense I cannot imagine him making much of a living in any other historical era because he would have probably been burned at the stake, hanged for blasphemy, if he hadn't already committed suicide).  In the sense of his struggles and sense of enlightened vision and then promotion of this enlightened self, the author, Eckhart Tolle, could be likened to a modern day Muhammad, Jesus, or Bhudda (I hope no one is offended).  The message is clear and draws from the author's believed similarities of all major religions and world philosophies.  This book would not be suitable for any unable to let go of religious biases, though; it is perfect for those objective and accepting enough to give new ideas a chance.  As the title eludes to, this book focuses on what we can do as individuals to see our true, inner-self so as to first understand what and who we are as individual spirits/people and to then arrive at spiritual oneness with ourselves.  The object is to follow the logic of the book, step by step, to ultimately arrive at spiritual enlightenment, which is the point where one will be content with their abilities and inabilities, learn to appreciate and take advantage of every moment (ideally, of course), and learn to behave as you only once wished you were capable of behaving towards others.  Like any religious belief, the ideal can never be obtained, but this book is a healthy start.  I have much respect for the author's views, and think this book should be widely read so as to open more minds to a more refreshing and non-violent spiritual paradigm.

0684800713|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I love the simple imagery of Hemingway and the experiences he writes about: bullfighting, fishing, drinking, dancing, fighting, drinking, going to local taverns to eat and drink, romance, travel, and drinking.  I have never studied Hemingway and know not why he is a part of a generation lost, but I am 21 and love to read his short stories (which I highly recommend all to buy the complete one book version of) and found this book to be a great read.
B00004Z400|5.0|Deftones are not the easiest band to like, I say this beacause every Deftones album I've ever picked up, I never really liked at first listen, especially this album. I was so used to their older sound so I was really confused when I listened to the whole album, but the more and more I listened to it, the more I liked it. They are pioneers to this genre of music as wu-tang clan was to rap. I wouldn't say everbody was trying to copy them (in earlier years) but most nu-metal bands were definetly influenced. Now with the WHITE PONY release they stand alone with their own unique sound. I'm not saying they aren't influenced because you can hear a weezer/tool/depeche mode slash this and that influence, but thats what makes this band so great. With songs like passenger,(which should've gotten some radio air play) pink maggit, change, rx queen, well pretty much whole album is good, one thing I was really dissapointed with is that should've kept \\"the boys republic\\" on this album and shyed away from \\"mini maggit\\" other than that this is one of the best albums that came out in 2000. It's definetly worth buying.
0316548189|5.0|This is the type of book I could not put down.  I knew only of Mandela's name and elementary accomplishments going into reading the book.  I found his telling of his life to be exciting, for good and ill.  Although I may be somewhat biased in my praise of this book, due to my lack of knowledge of any other view other than Mandela's about Mandela, it is probably safe to day this is a book well worth reading.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Why? I mean come on! Plot holes? Watch ressurection if you want plot holes!! But really, i think this movie is preatty good and it has my favorite &quot;style&quot; of all of them, but why do people hate it so much? It is a litlle disappointing for a sequal after &quot;Aliens&quot; (THe best in the series) but no sequal can top aliens! It also does get unique, with the alien being a runner (the facehugger facehugs a dog, in turn the alien is more orange-ish and uses all fours more) AND most of the inmates suffering from XYY chromosomes (most males have XY ONLY chromosomes) making them more brutal, stronger, and increased horemones and such. You know, people say it has no character development and such, but david finchers ORIGINAL VERSION was 2hrs and 50 minutes! MAybe more character developments in there! <br />Also the part of the &quot;plot hole&quot; of the beginning with how the facehugger gets on board, i know the REAL explanation (They actually filmed it!) It NOT two eggs or two facehuggers like they say, it's actually a &quot;super facehugger&quot; which the queen carries (probably)onto the sulaco on ALiens. It lays a queen egg and then a &quot;protecter&quot; (wich has direct telepathic link to the unborn queen). THe super facehugger facehugs riply and the dog. Now they didn't film the explenation (i don't think) but they milmed a seen where on of the prisoners finds the superfacehugger and thinks it's a jellyfish (I've seen it!. It's a little bigger than a normal facehugger and has webbing between the ?fingers?&quot; SO there<br />just wanted to explain that once and for all.
B00005JM1F|2.0|Old School is one of the worst movies I have ever seen!  Will Ferrel is one of the greatest American comedy actors ever.  But if I was basing his career on this movie.  I'd say he's one of the worst.  This movie was a bland, boring movie with a predictable ending.  I won't spoil it, but I'm sure you've seen this kind of ending numerous times.  This comedy had some funny parts, but that's the only reson it gets 2 stars.  The story line was terrible.  DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!

0385504209|1.0|You can't put it down, but you hate to see it end.  At least, that's how it was for me.  My first exposure to Dan Brown...I loved this book.  It taught me things as it entertained me...  yes, the ending came on a bit quick, but it still &quot;got me&quot;...<br />I have since purchased a couple of his other books and can't wait to jump back into this gentleman's mindset.<br />Entertains &amp; makes ya think.  My kinda book!
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a book with a type of humor not found in many other books and it will make you laugh unlike any other type of humor. The book is about the fashionably plump, main character Ignatius who creates problems for others because of his unusual view of the world and his dedication to change it to fit his views. Ignatius still lives with his mother even though he has graduated from college with a master's degree. His mother, Mrs. Reilly, forces him to get a job after an accident involving a building and her car, which both need to be repaired.  Given they are a poor family with no father, the mother tells Ignatius to get a job.   Ignatius first gets a job filing at a pant manufacturing company called Levy pants.  Mr. Levy decides it is not a good idea to hire Ignatius after he forges a letter and sends it to a client of Levy pants who responds with a $500 thousand lawsuit. Once Ignatius is fired, he gets a second job as a hot dog street vendor in New Orleans where the book takes place. He eats most of his merchandise and becomes even heavier. Ignatius is fired from this job when he appears in the newspaper passed out from shock in front of The Night of Joy on Bourbon Street. This is a book that will keep you laughing given the dark humor with which it is written.  Additionally, it will make you thankful that you are not as lazy as Ignatius Reilly.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This Cd is one of the best i have heard in a long time. I compare it to coldplay's &quot;Parachutes,&quot; Train's self titled album, and Travis' &quot;The Man who&quot;. An excellent mix of alternative rock with very mild country and beutiful acoustic guitar rifts and melodies. It has a sort of Neil Young ring to it, but it also captures the concepts and feelings of our youth's time. I give it an all out must have, It is one of the best Cd's i can suggest to any kind of rock music fan.
B000068PQ0|4.0|At the photo-finish, the LIPS pull ahead and...the underground comparison between this band and Mercury Rev is shattered and the Rev's fade to the rear. Why do I say this?.. not just because both trio's record in the Woodstock region of NY- with all its karma underpinnings- and Master Dave- is engineer / recordist and some time muse/collaborator for both- heck, some folks (including moi years ago) thought the singers were the same person- BUT the nascent conceptual competition has become a mute point. <BR>This is a lush album, and a good [I'm sure Warner Bros. think so!] answer to the Soft Bulletin- but it lacks the drop-dead sheer brilliance of that opus. ALL WE HAVE IS NOW is my fave side- a beautiful, almost \\"perfect\\" pop song. The hello-kitty Japan nod [with Japanese text on the cover] has become a bit trite in hipster circles, and I think these song(s) are the weakest- even though it is the obvious hanger for the product. All in all a fine effort by Wayne C. and Co.- BUT- check out Zaireeka on this site, and the very insightful review by -jason- \\"...you know it's the mystery\\".
0688163173|5.0|I'll add to the lavish praise because... well, Lehane more than deserves it.<br />I thought Lehane would disappoint me after leaving his Patrick/Angie stories. Man alive, was I wrong. This novel was spellbinding, to say the absolute least. I stayed up well into the night to keep from missing out on what happened next. When this book ends, you almost have to physically stop yourself from flipping back and starting it all over again.<br />Buy this book. For [the price] here, it's a steal.
B00001OH7P|4.0|Well, I'm a huge Bowie fan, and I really like this CD. But I think that those who tell it's the best Bowie has ever done are wrong. To my mind &quot;Hunky Dory&quot; (THIS is Bowie's best) or even &quot;Aladdin Sane&quot; are better. Indeed, &quot;Soul love&quot; and &quot;It ain't easy&quot; are quite annoying and the whole disc is a little repetitive. But don't forget this is the one with &quot;Starman&quot;,&quot;Lady Stardust&quot;,&quot;Rock'n roll suicide&quot;. So, one day, you will have to buy it...
B000002C1V|3.0|Let me start with this. I am a huge PF fan, but I wouldn't say this is an PF album. This is mostly Roger Waters out of control work. I Like Roger a lot, when though he is under the control of the rest of PF. He is a very good song writer and you can see this in all of the PF albums. The real problem with The Final Cut is that those songs are simply left over from The Wall. So, the question is HOW MUCH DO YOU LIKE TO EAT THE LEFT OVERS FROM A VERY FINE MEAL ON THE NEXT DAY???. Here is the same - The Wall is one of the finest, greatest and the most perfectly done albums in the rock music ever and you can hear the input from all of the members of PF (How about David Gilmour's input?) In the Final Cut David and Nick are there, but just to play not to correct. So, I gave it 3 stars, but I really was thinking about 1. If you want to hear the real PF or you are new to PF pick some other album like DSOTM, Wish you were here, The Wall, Animals, or even Division Bell.
6304806426|4.0|&quot;The English Patient&quot; is a great film but the DVD edition sorely lacks any features.  This is somewhat of a mystery to me since one of Anthony Minghella's later films &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; has the full DVD treatment with commentary and I consider &quot;Patient&quot; to be a better film.<br />Nevertheless, The English Patient is film-making at its best and worth seeing.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is delightfull,I too had only heard a few soft songs that werent really to my liking,but then a good friend showed me the harder side of them and I found that there softer songs were better than the harder ones,it is one of my favorite albums i own.
0156027321|5.0|I had heard about this book for a while, I had read some brief descriptions, was mildly intrigued, but did not consider it seriously.  Once I finally cracked it open and began to read, I was so intrigued, I finished it within the week. <br />Why should you read this book?<br />1. It's genuinely funny.<br />2. It deals with religion in a quite unique way.  It puts particular importance on a personal relationship with god within the religion(s).  (The main character is a fervent believer in three different ones)<br />3. The book is supposedly based on a true story.  How much is real?  How much a fantasy of the author?  It feels real as it describes reality in all it's wonder and brutality.  It makes you think what would happen to you if you were stuck on a lifeboat alone in the Pacific ... with or without a Bengal Tiger.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Released in 1972, \\"Fragile\\" is a progressive rock masterpiece that should be in all rock lovers cd collection. As excellent an album as it was, it produced just one major hit in \\"Roundabout\\". I remember hearing the song played repeatedly on radio back then and never got sick of it. The entire album is full of excellent, well crafted songs such as \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\", \\"Long Distance Runaround\\", \\"South Side Of The Sky\\" and the above mentioned \\"Roundabout\\". Of note, this album was also keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman's debut with the band and there's a definate classical influence in the songs with the addition of Wakeman (listen to \\"Cans And Brahms\\"). This special edition of \\"Fragile\\" contains two bonus tracks in \\"America\\" (the full 10 min. version) and an extra version of \\"Roundabout\\" (Early Rough Mix) which is similar to the original version except that the vocals and harmonizing are more pronounced and the arrangement is different in certain parts. There's also a thirteen page booklet included which tells about the songs on the album as well as some nice color photos of the members of the band. The digipack that holds the disc is also very attractive. Soundwise this new remastered version is far superior to the early 90's remaster in that the sound is cleaner, more mid-range, bottom end and punch has been added. If you enjoy seventy's classic rock such as Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Genesis, King Crimson, etc. \\"Fragile\\" is a must have. Highly Recommended.
0312263120|5.0|I have read many of the greatest epics ever written --The Illiad and The Odyssey by Homer (more than 5 times each), The Aeneid by Virgil twice, The Divine Comedy by Dante, Beowulf, Gilgamesh, Candide, The Republic by Plato, most of Euripedes, most of Sophocles, most of Aeschylus, Stasinus, Arctinus, Lesches, Agais, Sappho, The Histories by Herodotus, Bulfinch's Mythology, The Fall of Troy by Quintus Smyrnaeus, The Best of The Achaens-Pindar's Homer and others by Nagy, Greek Heroine Cults by Larson, Homeric Variations On A Lament By Briseis by Casey Due Hackney, Imagining Illegitimacy In Classical Greek Literature by Mary Ebbott, most of Shakespeare, Machiavelli, Marco Polo, Melville, all of Robert Ludlum, all of Clavell, some of Clancy, most of James Patterson, most of Trevanian, some of Follett, Some of Van Lustbader, most of Robin Cook, most of Crichton, most of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, most of Thomas Harris, most of Grisham, some of Hesiod and Pindar, all of Robert Ludlum, all of J.K. Rowling, some of Buck, most of J.R.R. Tolkien, and my all time favorite, till now, Shibumi by Trevanian.<BR>Once I started reading \\"Digital Fortress,\\" I couldn't put it down until I finished it the same day. That has never happened for me. \\"Who will guard the guards?\\" Nothing could be so true. Dan Brown has created in Digital Fortress the unbreakable code that has been encrypted using itself. (Kind of like building a safe and putting the blue-prints inside.) Digital Fortress would make the NSA obsolete and there would be no more big brother. If you are into computers, like I am, this is a definite 10+++++++, must read, thriller. Some of the words are boggling: Andalusian Sun, Eidetic Memory, Ciphertext and Cleartext, Pedagogue, Julius Caesar's Perfect Square, Cupola, Brute Force Attack, Rotating Clear Text Algorithm and the best one - Rhyolite Satellites in Geosynchronous Orbit. And after all this, there is still more. He gives you a code to break and a free gift if you break the code. If you don't break the code, in my opinion, you didn't really finish the book. 128-10-93-85-10-128-98-112-6-6-25-126-39-1-68-78. I solved it. (Did you?) What a great ending. Oh yeah, don't forget about the Book Jacket on the Hardbound cover. Nice touch. (I'll bet most people didn't even catch that.) Can't wait to read it again. I think I will right now. Thanks Dan Brown -- Tom Leonard...
0385504209|3.0|As a published author myself ([...] I must be careful when reviewing the work of other authors.  From that context, I was blown away at the depth of treatment Dan Brown gave to this wild premise, which is nothing if not compelling.  It showcases the power of fiction, in that this story might actually sway the religous beliefs of some readers (it shouldn't, by the way), in that it reflects doubts and questions many harbor, which is a credit to the author.  While impressed (indeed, intimidated) by the conceptual execution, I found the writing somewhat less than intimidating, at times eloquent, at other times pedestrian, though never as bad as some other reviewers have said.  This is yet another example (along with \\"Derailed\\" by James Seigel) of what happens when a publisher decides to push a book onto the lists (as opposed to \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" which was \\"pulled\\" onto the lists by its readers).  I hope for such a push myself, someday. I'm glad my [purchase price]is tax deductible, as I found myself reading it for research as much as pleasure.  This is a #1 bestseller... and in that, I find great hope.
B00004Z459|3.0|This cd got me into harder mainstream music. I owe it my life for that. But otherwise, this cd is just average. I don't know why everyone raves about it. It is good. I like it alot, but i used to like it more. Wears thin quickly and has little replayability. Definetely worth owning for any fan of rock. Despite not being the first raprockers, they made it commercially acceptable to create rapcore music and opened up a lot of doors for crossover bands such as hed p.e. mushroomhead crazy town and the like. Pioneers!
0380977788|4.0|If you're a comic book fan, you are probably familiar with how wonderful things can be when you combine Gaiman with McKean.  Coraline is another great example of that.  McKean's illustrations fit the mood of Coraline perfectly, leaving haunting images in the mind.<br />Coraline, while aimed at younger readers, made me a bit nervous in the dark, though I am 17.  If I were younger, I imagine I'd be frightened to the point of nightmares.<br />Like The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis (one of Gaiman's favorites), Coraline tells the story of a young person who opens a door which isn't supposed to lead anywhere, and finds herself in a strange, interesting, new world.  Coraline is surrounded by semi-familiar, creepy, Other people with big black buttons for eyes.  She must save herself, her parents, a cat, and three other children's souls.<br />The other mother is particularly creepy.  A control-freak who has created, or claimed, her own world and uses people to try to trap Coraline.  She wants a child to love, but to a frightful extent.  Imagine a sweet scent, but imagine it so strong and sweet that you are choking under it.  That is the Other Mother's love.  When she doesn't get what she wants, she can be nasty.  And that's the scary part.
B00005JLR2|4.0|Well, from the look of the trailers I have to say this film looked like it would really stink.  Then I decided to rent it and I must say, it's among Disney's best films.  From the people who brought you ALADDIN, TREASURE PLANET (fairly well adapted from Robert Louis Stevenson's classic &quot;Treasure Island&quot;) is an immensely entertaining film set in a futuristic space-based world, where Jim Hawkins teams up with a group of the oddest creatures ever - including cyborg Long John Silver - to find a lost treasure hidden somewhere on an undiscovered planet.  Good voice acting, a very nice soundtrack and some extremely cool animation add to the fun; I must say it's very, very good, surprisingly good compared to the bad trailers.  Overall, I highly recommend that you take a journey to the TREASURE PLANET as quick as you can!
630027179X|5.0|Well, it looks like Johnny really did \\"gain on it\\", as Henry put it in \\"The Lion In Winter\\". The very same actor that portrayed the gimpy Prince John, supposedly Henry's favorite, in that film, portrays King Arthur here, and he does a damned good job! John Castle and Anthony Hopkins, (whose career had not taken off yet,) must have been fuming when they saw this film!<br />\\"Excalibur\\" is one of those films that stays with you forever. Little of it is flawed. The acting is incredible, considering that the story is set 1300 years in the past and the production has just the right \\"dirt under the fingernails\\" look to it that an early medieval setting SHOULD have. (This has been a great hallmark of just about EVERY pre-19th century period film since \\"Taras Bulba\\"!) However, what sets the look of \\"Excalibur\\" apart is the artful look of late seventies disco glitz applied here that somehow doesn't look out of place in this movie!<br />The acting of the people playing the main characters AND the supporting players is excellent, as if they truly FEEL the surge of excitement of their roles right down to their toes. Nigel Terry, Helen Mirren, Cherie Lunghi, Robert Addie and Paul Geoffrey do an excellent job of giving the characters of \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" substance. Lunghi looks positively saintly as Guinevere; Nicholas Clay, as Lancelot, balances the hubris and humility of the character well....but Helen Mirren, as the supremely wronged and offended Morgana, is something to watch. You truly begin to realize just how wronged she WAS, having the bastard son of a deception perpetrated by Merlin become King of Camelot. Arthur's father, Uther Pendragon, KILLED Morgana's father and RAPED her mother, with the help of Merlin, simply because he coveted her...Morgana has had to watch Arthur's fortunes rise knowing just who he is and how he came to be! Mirren plays this aspect of her role to the hilt, and it works.<br />Rospo Pallenberg wrote the book and the screenplay that the movie is based on, taken from Sir Thomas Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" written so long ago. John Boorman directs all of the above and more, including his own son, Charlie, as the younger Mordred, someone always portrayed as a viper, and daughter, Katrine, as Ygwaine, Arthur and Morgana's mother.<br />Keep your eye pealed for one of the first movie roles of Patrick Stewart as Count Leandegrance, Guinevere's father. You won't even recognize Gabriel Byrne in one of HIS first roles as Uther.<br />A near perfect film. I'm sure Castle and Hopkins probably WERE fuming when they first saw this!based on, taken from Sir Thomas Mallory's \\"Le Morte D'Arthur\\" written so long ago.

B00005JLD4|5.0|Phillip Noyce's \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" is based on the true story of Daisy, Molly and Gracie, three half-caste children in Western Australia in 1931. The Australian government continued enforcing until 1970 a law that allowed mixed race children to be removed forcibly from their parents and sent to boarding schools to \\"educate\\" them for a white world. The girls were trained to be servants and domestics. The whole system was similar to the Indian schools in the United States, where First Nations children were sent to be raised as pious, productive, educated young adults, but the system there too frequently failed. The plan was that the half-caste girls would marry whites or other half-castes and have the Aboriginal \\"bred out of them,\\" as policy director A.O. Neville (Kenneth Branagh) explains to a local ladies' society.<br />Daisy, Molly and Gracie are sent to the Moore River Native Settlement in Perth, over 2000 kilometres from their home in Jigalong Station. They do not last more than a few days before Molly, the ringleader, plans their escape through brush and desert, finding her way home by following the rabbit-proof fence, the longest in the world, that divides pasture from rabbit-infested bush. Neville and his men, including a skilled Aboriginal tracker, Moodoo (film veteran David Gulpilil) search for weeks in pursuit of the girls, and one is eventually recaptured in a harrowing scene, only steps from safety with the other girls.<br />There is very little in the way of dialogue, and although Noyce's child actors are all unskilled, there are remarkable performances and true moments of fear, desperation, and grief shine through. The girls' mother and grandmother are particularly effective at conveying the mind-shattering grief they must live with knowing that they may never see their girls again. In one touching scene, at separate points on the fence, thousands of kilometres apart, both the mother and the girls tightly grip the fence, lightly shaking it, as if they could feel the resulting vibrations and sense the others' presence there.<br />The cinematography shows off the dry palette of the desert, the spectacular desert sunsets, the shimmering wave of heat that covers the landscape. This film reminded me in some ways of the 1971 Australian film \\"Walkabout,\\" which starred Gulpilil as an Aboriginal teenager, and follows two white children that are stranded in the outback with only Gulpilil as a guide. The \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" score by Peter Gabriel is low-key and appropriately tension-filled, meditative and mysterious at key moments, with wisps of Aboriginal chant and song woven into a lush synth background, and reminded me of the excellent soundtrack to Australian sci-fi series \\"Ocean Girl\\" by Garry McDonald and Laurie Stone. The narration at the beginning and end of the movie was the most powerful for me: the real-life Molly and Daisy, now old women in bright clothes that are startlingly out of place against the backdrop of the outback they slowly walk through, tell how the story ended. And that was the saddest truth of all.<br />The included documentary \\"Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" shows Noyce flying to remote outback communities looking for Aboriginal child actors, auditioning thousands of hopefuls before settling on the final three, Everlyn Sampi, Tianna Sansbury, and Laura Monaghan, as well as the emotional journey for the temperamental star and the harrowing experience of filming the girls' abduction at the hands of a white officer. Pretty much the whole cast and crew was in tears and shaken afterwards, forced to relive the crucial moment that defined the \\"Stolen Generations:\\" the theft from their mothers' arms, some never to be seen or heard from again.<br />An excellent film that treats a little-known subject outside of Australia (and fairly unspoken within), with the fresh-faced innocence of children who beat the odds and found their way home across 2000 km of largely uninhabited, hostile terrain to the waiting arms of their family.aiting arms of their family.
0688163173|2.0|I had high hopes but I found this book contrived and it fell flat as a pancake at the end. I could feel the author trying to complcate the story at the expense of the flow. Sorry. Maybe it's just me. just me.
B000060P79|1.0|&quot;ok, i saw simple plan at the warped tour l;ast year and thought they put on a good show, so i bought they're cd. Ill admit i liked some songs at first, after about a few weeks i was so annoyed with songs like &quot;Id do anything&quot; and &quot;addicted&quot; that i would just turn the RADIO off when they came on.  One thing that annoys me is the song structure of all they're songs. Intro then verse then intro then chorus then cheesy drum roll then chorus then back to intro, repeat this 12 times and u got all the songs on this cd.  Another thing is the whining, Pierre sounds like hes a little girl. I did meet them, yea they arer nice guys, but wayyyyy to many middle school girls at the shows. Heres what they need to have on their next cd in order to get my respect.  1)Faster beats 2)A little anger 3) Less predictable songs<BR>one more thing before i go...playing along with O-town and Celine deion at KISS concert isnt a good thing to do if SP is gonna call themselves punk, dont waste ur money, get the new Ataris cd instead.
0064407667|5.0|Being only 13, it is very difficult to find a book for my age nowadays that I can learn from or that is entertaining in the slightest. With A Series of Unfortunate Events, though, I found myself turning each page with wonderful anticipation each and every time. I honestly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Harry Potter series. Before reading this book, I feared that it would be a disgraceful copy of the Harry Potter series but to my surprise, it was actually a very diverse and eye-catching book that turned out to be one of my favorites. I have now read every single book in the Series of Unfortunate Events excepting book #9, The Carnivorous Carnival, and I do not regret any of the time spent reading them at all. I had a fantastic adventure diving into each and every story and spending the day with Violet, Klaus, Sunny, Count Olaf, and all of the other hilarious as well as fascinating and interesting characters that add so much to the humor as well as to the beautiful plot that keeps us all going. Lemony Snicket has such a way with words that can keep any child's eyes glued to the pages. Snicket's writings add to any reader's vocabulary in a whole new motivating and efficient way while at the same time keeping a smile on their faces. The way that he digresses into his own adventurous and rebellious life keeps us tantalized to his amazing stories. Although I am only one person, I can speak for many other readers of The Bad Beginning and the other stories in the Series of Unfortunate Events by saying that I am caught between the stories of the Baudelaires and of Lemony Snicket. There are times when Snicket starts to digress into his own life when I think, \\"Stop talking about yourself; get back to the mysterious and tempting plot of the Baudelaire children!\\" but then I find myself tied up in the middle of Snicket's life instead! There are so many examples of this in action that anyone can find just by reading these books and these examplesare those that make the stories so wonderful and attractive. I recommend these books to anyone and I hope that if this review helps you and you decide to read The Bad Beginning or any of the other Series of Unfortunate Events books that you enjoy them as much as I did. Happy reading!
6303471714|5.0|Regardless of the Amazon reviewer's warnings, this is the best video on the market.  The exercises keep my heart rate up and tone muscles extremely effectively.  Plus the music is great!  The reviewer cites back injuries, etc., but IF you know how to exercise correctly, you can avoid arching your back, keep your knee aligned with you foot when lunging, etc.  The exercises are too fast for beginners, but go at a reasonable pace to start and work your way up.  Try it AND STAY WITH IT ... it is difficult, but the results are worth it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I loved this album at first listen. Ever since I first listened to \\"Around the World,\\" I was hooked. The standouts I enjoy are \\"Around the World,\\" (lots of energy here, will definatly get you pumped)  \\"Get on Top,\\" (Love the funk and the rap) \\"Easily,\\" (Isn't it about War and the Draft?) \\"Porcelain,\\" (beautiful lullaby) \\"This Velvet Glove,\\" (a heartfelt and soulful song) \\"Purple Stain,\\"(really freaky sounding yet way cool in the chorus' with the reverb) and \\"Road Trippin'.\\" (a beautiful sad masterpiece; absolutly gorgerous song)<br />But the more I listen to it the more I feel like it's actually just two short albums on one CD. \\"Around the World\\" to \\"Porcelain\\" is the first album and \\"Emit Remmus\\" to \\"Road Trippin'\\" is the second. The first record leans more to the rock/alternative side while the second record emphasizes more of the funk/psychedelic side. <br />Although both aren't exclusive to certain sounds they both have their own particular vibe. I believe both albums are perfectly lagit standing by themselves and both embrace the Chili Peppers goals.
0385474547|5.0|I chose to read this book for a report in my High School World History class.  From some of the reviews I read, they made it seem like the book was going to be a boring waste of my time, but it wasn't.  It is an easy book to read, not long at all, and it helps you learn a lot about the Nigerian culture.  The book is about a man named Okonkwo who is afraid to share his feelings for fear of being thought as weak and he had to protect his reputation.  He is brave, but stands alone a lot with his decision to fight.  He believes everyone in the tribe has turned into women when they do not want to fight, but deep down he is just like them, but afraid of how people will now view him.  When he starts to become violent he accidentally kills a man and is forced to leave his tribe.  When he is allowed to return his society has changed dramatically.  Missionaries have come to teach the different African countries of the right ways, but the people of Okonkwo's tribe have different views on how to live their life.  The missionaries do not understand their way of life and so this book show how communication can be a problem that can lead to the downfall of a once powerful society.  I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about previous African culture in a well written, interesting, book.
6305878323|5.0|i saw this film when i was a kid now i have gotten the dvd version for my kids
0688163173|5.0|If one day I was driving to work and author Dennis Lehane plowed into me-wrecking my car, then got out laughing, telling me I had on an ill-fitting suit and an ugly tie and that he'd been by my house earlier in the week and my wife, kids and dog weren't too much to brag about either...I still think the only thing I could say back to him is-thank you for writing this book. It's that damn good. What an amazing novel.
0312305060|3.0|The Hours is another example of artistes taking subjects of great gravity (depression, memory,life, lost love) and then falling short of expectations when it comes to delivering on these themes with truth. Sure, The Hours is a beautifully &quot;written&quot; book. Cunningham's language is flawless though it does get a little too ornate and poetic at times. I love lyrical prose and dense, vivid images but the quality of the same in The Hours suffered from what i can call vacant, heartless gossamer syndrome. The entire book with its themes and its supposedly deft execution is cleverly calculated to &quot;win&quot; over critics. One can easily get deluded into believing that the book's premise ( cutting across time and space to reveal the bare bones of womanhood and its attendant suffering and small joys)guarantees a read that will be richly illuminating. In your first read you will come away from this book feeling a little uncertain of its &quot;charms&quot;. I was not sure how to react. It seemed &quot;great&quot; and for a while, i bought into all the hype and literally convinced myself that this indeed was a contemporary classic. But the doubts that lingered in the back of my head crystallised as soon as i started the second read. <BR>This is a very pretentious book. It is heavily contrived and crafted with the kind of magnificence and precision that is, to put it mildly, subtly ostentatious. You wont really know that you are being clevery and very grandly, being fooled. Its basically like the teenager's archetypal story of depression that is smartly veiled with ambiguous remarks, obscure imagery and some intelligent italicised passages. <BR>I dont know how the rest of you feel but there is something intrinsically &quot;not ok&quot; with this work. it just does not ring true and i think thats simply because it is too forced. I feel bad writing this bcos i had high expectations from this book and was waiting to lap it up with eagerness and delight. But i cant possible endorse something like this, its not what it seems. <br />Like i said, a subtle but unmistakable air of literary contrivance hangs densely in every page. Dont get fooled by this. If you want depth, beauty and intelligence tempered with grace and shimmering prose, read Michael Ondaatje or Milan Kundera. Now thats the real thing. The Hours is a hyena masquerading in the skin of a lion.
B00008H2LB|4.0|It took them 2 years to put out another 14 track CD that lasts 35 minutes, but it's an awesome 35 minutes.  It's a little bit harder than Hybrid Theory, but it does have a soft and slower song.  Over all, good CD!
B00008J2DQ|3.0|&quot;Awake&quot; and their first release are by far MUCH better.  The tracks on this CD sound identical, mix and guitar riff wise, as their other songs.  Plus, we've all heard &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; a million times now.  So that's one less 'new' track on this CD.  If you're a Godsmack fan, buy it, but if you just want to listen to new music, I'd recommend &quot;Meteora&quot; by Linkin Park, or wait for the new Staind CD due out 5/20/2003, &quot;14 Shades of Gray&quot;.
B00008WG3U|3.0|Its not their best album, but it has some good songs on it like &quot;the seperation of church and skate&quot;. I dont like the ska songs, and if they werent on there, the cd would be alot better.
B000001Y42|5.0|They simply just rule.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>1)Intro - Just an intro, not rated.<br />2)Pollution - This song is pretty good, but you'll get bored very quick with Fred yelling \\"back\\" the entire end of the song, good thing the others told him to shut up. Other than that stuff at the end, all-out cool. 10/10<br />3)Counterfeit - This one's the first hit Limp ever recorded. It's heavy and cool, but still isn't as good a hit as Faith is. 8/10<br />4)Stuck - Much like Counterfeit, only it's more agressive and has more importance for DJ Lethal. Lethal has to be the best turntable worker in the world. 9/10<br />5)Nobody Loves Me - More aggressive than Stuck, this is one of the heaviest songs recorded by Limp. Only problem is that it's too aggressive. But still my favourite song. 10/10+<br />6)Sour - Here's where Wes Borland struts his stuff with the guitar, and DJ Lethal once again makes a stunning show with the turntables. Fred, was your ex-gf really like that? Well, you did good Fred. 9/10<br />7)Stalemate - Although I've listened to Stalemate before, I've only listened to it once, so I can't remember if it was cool or not. ?/10<br />8)Clunk - This song is pretty sweet, especially the chorus with the special vocal effect. 7/10<br />9)Faith - As far as Faith goes, like I said earlier, this song is certainly better than Counterfeit. That hidden track at the end was a waste of time I think, cool song. 9/10<br />10)Stink Finger - Another song revolving around anger. Quick and cool. 10/10<br />11)Indigo Flow - I thought this was good until I heard Significant Other's Show Me What You Got. So this song isn't very good, but still better than that Intro. 8/10<br />12)Leech(Demo Version) - Even though it's a demo version, I think this should be the real version. The Heaviest song and my 2nd favourite song. 10/10<br />13)Everything - Cool, effect at the beginning, but the rest of the song, you cannot understand. However, you can recognize the stiff at the end. 4.5/10 for the length.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>Great debut album, although I recommend Significant Other or Chocolate Starfish And The Hot Dog Flavored Water.
0385504209|1.0|I feel cheated,any amount paid for this is robbery!!!This is the worst book and storyline I've ever read.I tried to finish it but with little or no value in his story I couldn't stomach any more!Some of his ideas border on the insane,others demand you park your brain outside the door.<br />Save your money don't buy this book.I wish I hadn't.
B00005JLK1|2.0|Imagine this: you're a member of an elite salvage crew that works in the Bering Strait between Alaska and Russia. One evening you and your crewmates are celebrating your most recent successful salvage operation in a bar in Alaska. Suddenly, you're interrupted by a \\"mysterious stranger\\" who claims he's a pilot who's found a huge, derelict ocean liner in the Strait. He says that the US Navy and Coast Guard isn't interested in the ship because it's in international waters, which means it's open for someone to claim salvage rights. So, without asking any questions (such as: what is a huge abandoned ocean liner doing in the Bering Strait, why wouldn't the Coast Guard be interested in such a ship, the credentials of the mysterious stranger, etc.) you'd agree to immediately sail out to the ship, right? If you said \\"yes\\", then you'll probably love this film. If, however, you enjoy classic horror films such as \\"Halloween\\", \\"The Others\\", or even the original \\"Dracula\\", or \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\", then you should avoid taking a ride on the \\"Ghost Ship\\". This film lacks all of the elements of a good horror movie: plot, suspense, chills, a creepy atmosphere, and logic; and it has all the elements of most modern horror films: lots of special effects, blood and gore, and MTV-style music and filming techniques. The plot (such as it is) goes like this: in 1962 a luxurious Italian passenger ship, the \\"Antonia Graza\\" is serenely sailing the Atlantic. In a single night, however, everyone on board, save one, is killed (usually in the most painful, gruesome, and bloody way possible). Of course, the ship then vanishes without a trace. Forty years later the ship suddenly reappears over 5,000 miles away in the Bering Strait. The salvage team literally collides with the ship on a stereotypical \\"dark and stormy night\\" (and there's loads of stereotypes and cliches in this film). The salvage team boards the ship, and naturally things soon go terribly wrong: they begin to see the ghostsof the dead crew and passengers; their salvage tug explodes, trapping them on the ship; and then the salvage team begins to die horrible deaths, just as happened in 1962. Eventually only one member (Julianna Marguiles, as the team's tender-but-tough \\"mother hen\\"), is left to confront the villain who started the killing back in 1962. The paint-by-numbers plot allows you to figure out what's going to happen long before the hapless salvagers do, and the ending is so convoluted that it resembles \\"Titanic\\" meets \\"Ghost\\" meets \\"The Exorcist\\". Particularly absurd is the five-minute \\"flashback\\" scene near the end in which we see what happened to the \\"Antonia Graza\\" on that fateful night in 1962. The scene is shot to resemble a MTV music video, complete with the soundtrack. I almost expected to see the \\"Smashing Pumpkins\\" or \\"Dave Matthews Band\\" in a cameo, singing away while everyone is being slaughtered. The only scary thing about this movie is that some top-notch actors (such as Marguiles and Gabriel Byrne) agreed to appear in this mess. Bottom line: if you like lots o' blood and gore, special effects, cardboard characters, and no plot, then you'll like this movie. But if you like classic horror films, then don't get aboard the \\"Ghost Ship\\".
B00006G8G1|5.0|Very good sound,very good DVD!<BR>There's nothing more to add...
B00005JLRT|4.0|At this point it is well known that the Star Trek series is directed at fans only.  Just as Enterprise is slowly going down the tubes along with every other Sci-Fi TV show out there this film was not well recieved.  However despite that problem the movie is actually pretty good and is a good way to end the NExt Generation Saga.<br />The story here is that Riker and Troy have finally gotten married.  Before they leave on their honeymoon (and Riker to his new Ship) the Enterprise makes a detuer to a planet with a strange anomally.  After a brief exploration (in a Jeep like vehicle) they discover another Android similar to Data.  They take it aboard and it ends up being a Proto-type.  Meanwhile a group of rebeliouse ROmulans are planning an attack on Earth lead by a clone of Picard.  What then ensues is that they battle to the death with a sacrafice that not even I saw coming.<br />Overall this movie is for fans of the NExt Generation who have stuck with it through all these years.  This is the final film and it did end with some style.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Absolutely one of the 10 best rock albums of the 1970s, and one largely unknown to today's audiences.  Trower and his band recorded many LPs, and rarely did they come close to achieving the kind of get-you-moving-and-move-you groove as heard on &quot;Bridge of Sighs.&quot;  Several years later &quot;Victims of the Fury&quot; ran a solid #2 on the Trower-o-meter, but &quot;BoS&quot; has longer tunes with no filler.  Solid beef rockburger, baby.<br />If you aren't familiar with BoS, I implore you to click on the samples on this page.  As a teen in the mid 1970s I was fortunate enough to listen to a radio station that carried &quot;Day of the Eagle&quot; and &quot;Too Rolling Stoned&quot; as heavy playlist items.  Start with those.  DotE has complex rhythms and scissor-sharp riffs that would make Rush pant to keep up.  TRS is more straightforward, with a long bluesy playout that dares you to not stomp your feet.  The title track and &quot;In This Place&quot; are not as hard, but equally intense, soulful, sad, beautiful, mournful, soaring experiences.<br />Hey.  You like rock music?  You like guitar?  You like Trower.  Cross this bridge right now.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Theres only one word that could describe Norah Jones on this CD...<br />BORING!<br />The music makes you fall asleep.  DOn't buy it.  She didn't deserve all of those awards that she won.
B000002HK4|4.0|I suppose I'm a \\"casual\\" DT fan.  I have most of their albums, but am not rabid about the band, mostly because I have to be in a certain mood to really get into their music.  I find some of their releases make poor casual listening simply because the length of songs and technicality require full attention.<br />That said, I found Change of Seasons to be a lot of fun.  The title song is one of their better long-form songs, IMHO, and the following track is good too.  Then we have three really cool covers, the last two being complex medolies of Led Zeppelin and a variety of bands, respectively.<br />It's not DT's most serious release or their biggest accomplishment musically.  But it's a really fun listen.  I find I go back to this CD more than their other releases for that very reason.
B000069AUI|2.0|This is not what I expected for Coldplay. I heard about the band from some friends who thought they were the greatest band ever, so I went and bought the CD. Turns out that their songs are very boring and all sound the same. I wouldn't reccomend listening to them while lieing down or you may fall asleep...<br />And that's what I wrote the first time.  Now I'm kind of changing my review of the cd because the more you listen to it, the more the songs get stuck in your head.  THey are slow songs, but they are still good.  The best song is the Scientest.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is not one of those movies you simply watch and quickly forget, and it's awfully hard to review.  Only once have I walked away in mid-review, feeling quite unable to do a subject justice, but I am ready now to start again and offer my own thoughts on this extraordinary film.  You know a film is something special when you wonder so many people could possibly like it.  I think American Beauty can justifiably be called quite weird, and the treatment of subjects such as a relationship between a forty-two-year-old man and a seventeen-year-old girl, complete family dysfunctionality, and murder most foul doesn't normally result in critical as well as box office success, not to mention such honors as Best Picture awards.  One thing this movie certainly has going for it is its shockingly original nature; no one had made a movie quite like this before.  What strikes me as really quite amazing is the fact that, despite all the buzz about this movie, I still had little idea of what to expect once I finally watched it for myself.  Then there is the talented cast; I can take or leave Kevin Spacey, and I do not like Annette Bening, but I can't deny their talents; I will admit that Mena Suvari was a prime motivator in my own initial attraction to this movie, though.  All told, each member of the cast gave a brilliant performance.  Then there is the incredible musical score, as well as the mesmerizing cinematography.  Of course, the heart of American Beauty is its story.<br /><br />The characters in this film are all living lives of quiet (sometimes not so quiet) desperation, and that is the source of the appeal to so many people.  Today's reality is unreality.  Some individuals might think they want nothing more than a normal life, but I believe that, deep down, no one wants to be ordinary.  Everyone wants to find a meaning for his/her life, even those who convince themselves otherwise.  Who of us is really happy?  American Beauty helps us acknowledge our own dreams of meaning and understanding, while at the same time it offers a level of comfort to those of us conscious of our unfulfilling lives.  The characters in this film come off as quite real, albeit a surreal form of real, and they are screwed up more than we are.  Lester Burnham even succeeds in finding a part of what he has been missing all his life, although that incredibly victorious moment is cut short at the end.  No one is whom they claim to be here, each character hiding secrets that are ultimately brought to light in the hypnotizing final moments; there are some significant revelations that many viewers may not anticipate.  These characters aren't truly fake, however; they are just unhappy.  While all of this intense emotional drama could well afflict the viewer with something akin to depression, American Beauty somehow manages to deliver a message of, if not hope then at least understanding and mutual sympathy, supporting us with many moments of dark comedy along the way, holding our hands down the long passage to the ultimate door of revelation.  And it is the most troubled individual of all who shows us that there is beauty in even the ugliest of circumstances, if we will just stop and look for it.ing and understanding, while at the same time it offers a level of comfort to those of us conscious of our unfulfilling lives.

B000089RVX|5.0|Wow. Ok I have to admit I was surprised by this cd. &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was overplayed. And i wasn't going to even consider this cd until I saw their music video on tv. Then I started thinking about getting it. Then after that I started seeing more and more awsome reviews online, but they were mixed with those &quot;rebels&quot; who loved to just bash the cd.. like they bash everything. <br />Anyway, I finally bought the cd. Feeling guilty the ride home, thinking &quot; Well, what will they be without Paul McCoy (who collaborated on &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;)? &quot; <br />I got home, popped the cd into my cd player and was astonished. I hadn't expected this cd to be good. It really is. I mean, the first time i heard it, i was like &quot;it's good..&quot; but every time i listen to it.. I like it even more. I can only imagine how good they are live. Amy Lee's voice is haunting, accompanied by equally powerful lyrics and music. The lyrics are really what make each song seperately stand out.<br />So, as a new listener, I have to say. Ignore the hype and just go by the fact that this cd IS something to be listened to with no previous expectations. I mean, when I heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; I thought it sounded like Linkin Park, with an added chick. But no, it isn't like that. It stands out.
B000066NW0|5.0|In my opinion, Avril Lavigne's Let Go is the most impressive debut album since Tori Amos' Little Earthquakes. I love everything about Avril: her sound, her song-writing prowess, her guitar-playing talent, her voice, her commitment, her honesty and realism, her attitude, her confidence, her individualism, etc. It's interesting to go back now and look at some of the critical reviews that came out when this album was released, seeing how even as beautiful and powerful a song as I'm With You was sometimes dismissed for its supposedly amateurish lyrics. Those who put down Avril's lyrics on this album don't really understand Avril Lavigne; this album is the product of a sixteen-year-old female trying to discover herself, deal with relationships, and generally figure out just what kind of world she is suddenly becoming an adult in. I'm no longer a teenager, but I like to pretend that I am, and these lyrics spoke volumes to me. The range of emotions Avril touches upon in her music run the gamut of normal teenager issues, finding extra fuel in a self-confidence and feeling of purpose that most young people (as well as most adults) will never know. I also hear a lot of critics say Avril sounds like Pink here, Alanis Morrissette there, someone else over here, etc. There's no reason why she wouldn't be influenced by other artists; even the most accomplished people get where they are by standing on the shoulders of those who have come before them. For my part, I find Avril absolutely original; while she may incorporate styles or sounds from elsewhere, she melds them all together into a sound and style all her own. Further proof that this is Avril's music can be found in the fact that she backed away from the talented professionals she was matched with when she first came to New York, then fortunately found in LA Reid a producer who allowed her to truly be herself.<br />I am continually amazed at the tracks on this album. Any one of these 13 tracks could be a hit single; that's how good this album is from start to finish. Of course, Complicated is the song that sent Avril into superstar orbit, Sk8er Boi gave us ample evidence of Avril's skateboard punk rock foundation, and then I'm With You and Losing Grip gave us glimpses of the vulnerable side lying not far below the brash and confident surface of this energetic new artist. Normally, you would expect some loss of intensity in the remaining songs, but not here. Avril really seems to have her finger on the pulse of a most vibrant life, reflecting her wonder and fascination with the world she is embracing for the first time in songs such as Mobile and Tomorrow. Things I'll Never Say is an exploration of private thoughts everyone she be able to relate to, Unwanted and Too Much to Ask reflect the confusion and vulnerability of the human soul, but Avril boldly declares that she is Nobody's Fool. Avril's sense of empowerment and confidence are two of the strongest, most appealing aspects of her music. My favorite song on the album, and perhaps the one that best represents Lavigne herself, is Anything But Ordinary. Too many of us die inside at an early age, and Avril seems to be determined not to let that happen.<br />The extras included on this enhanced CD are well worth noting. You get a short biography, a look at a day in the life of Avril Lavigne featuring impromptu performances on the sidewalks and subways of New York City, interview footage, the Complicated video, as well as - and this is certainly something not to be missed - an extra song track. Obviously, I'm a huge fan of Avril Lavigne, and I could not have asked for more from any veteran performer than I got from this newcomer on this extraordinary debut album.how good this album is from start to finish. Of course, Complicated is the song that sent Avril into superstar orbit, Sk8er Boi gave us ample evidence of Avril's skateboard punk rock foundation, and then I'm With You and Losing Grip gave us glimpses of the vulnerable side lying not far below the brash and confident surface of this energetic new artist. Normally, you would expect some loss of intensity in the remaining songs, but not here. Avril really seems to have her finger on the pulse of a most vibrant life, reflecting her wonder and fascination with the world she is embracing for the first time in songs such as Mobile and Tomorrow.

B00005JLWN|5.0|First off, the movie's plot is not new; more of a version of Bradbury's &quot;Farenhieght 451&quot; but I loved it. Christian Bale does a good job portraying a &quot;Cleric&quot;, an enforcer charged with rooting out people who still have outlawed emotions or materials deemed offensive (hmm, kind of like John Ashcroft, but Clerics blow up statues instead of cover their boobies). But the real attraction are the action scenes...WOW!! They are really good, real &quot;Matrix&quot; quality. The fight scene at the end blew me away, incredible!<br />Buy this film, an action film for the thinking man.

B00008S2VG|4.0|This album is different than Madonna's past albums in that it doens't have the immediate urgency and appeal as her past work. It doesn't have an 'Impressive Instant' or 'Ray of Light' that makes it immediately likable and danceable. On first listen, people who are used to Madonna's past efforts may think this is boring, but upon further listen, most will discover that this is only a natural progression for an artist who is basically a living legend.<br />Sonically, this is a continuation of  'Music'. With the help of Mirwais, most of the tracks are guiter strings mixed with electronic loops and breaks. This has become Madonna's signature style in the past few years and it's not hard to see why Madonna chose to stick to it on 'American Life'. The folksy guitar sound gives the songs a certain earthiness, soulfulness and realness, while the electronic beats reminds us of the true stylistic root of Madonna's music. <br />Lyrically, this album is interesting in that even though most people will agree that some of the lyrics are self-indulging and has nothing to do with the rest of the world, they are deeply personal. They encompass who Madonna is as a human being. She is obsessed with herself at times, sometimes confused, and constantly contradicting herself. These qualities are what the listeners can relate to, not so much the specifics of 'having 5 nannies and a jet'. Her lyrics are not the most poetically written lyrics ever but people have to give her credit for some of the greatest pop songs in the last 2 decades. And when you listen to songs like 'Love Profusion' and 'Nothing Fails', you realize that she really has matured and has became more inteeligent in her writing. <br />In summary, I'd say Madonna has 'done it again' with 'American Life'. It may not have people dancing on their feet on every track, but as part of a 20 year career, it is a landmark Madonna album in its honesty and venerability.

B00008J4P5|5.0|I have neen a fan of the White Stripes for a while now and i must say that Elephant is their greatest album to date.  They have really come into their own and have proved themselves a fully-fledged band.  The expansive guitar solos by Jack White and the vocals by Meg on &quot;in the cold, cold, night&quot; add interest to the White Stripes' music.  Elephant is definately the best rock cd to come along in a while and a must have for fans of the genre.

B00008PW3Q|1.0|On 1997's &quot;The Dance&quot; Lindsey prefaces Track 7, &quot; Bleed to Love Her&quot;  with:  &quot;this whole reconvening was an organic thing... I asked Mick to play drums on a solo album I was working on &amp; I'm still working on ... and ... here we are ... isn't that weird &quot;....  Christine responds &quot;that's pretty weird&quot;.  Well it's now six years later in 2003 and &quot;Bleed to Love Her&quot; shows up as Track 14 on &quot;Say You Will&quot; that's not weird, that's WEAK.  Chistine you have my respect for passing on this one. This CD is past tense, it's the Lindsey &amp; Stevie archives they've been individually working on for the last ten years and  threw  together under the Fleetwood Mac label. I've been a fan since 1973, I even purchased &quot;Buckingham Nicks&quot; which is a really nice album.  The bottom line is - every album/ CD released prior to this one is better, this effort just makes me feel like I was had.  We had Christine's &quot; Say You Love Me &quot; in '75 in '03 we get Stevie's &quot; Say You Will&quot; .... Say you will be snuckered would have been better.  Fleetwood Mac was a mix of Christine, Lindsey &amp; Stevie along with the muscianship of Mick &amp; John.  This effort shows how significant Christine was to the mix &amp; how much she is missed.

0060392886|5.0|I am not only a huge fan of all genres of literature.  I am not only a published novelist/writer.  But I am one of the biggest Motley Crue fans to ever walk the planet.  This book tells the story of four idols.  The REAL story and not some hollywood/MTV fake story for 13 year olds.  Nikki Sixx, Vince Neil, Tommy Lee and Mick Mars all tell the past twenty years (and their own very different childhoods) from their own point of view without holding back anything.  I can tell you now that not only is the Dirt the best source of info about the great band Motley Crue for fans, but will be a great book for ANYONE who is open minded.  The book is raw and exciting.  There is only one dull moment that I can remember, but then again there are people that I know that say that it is their favorite part of the book so I will not say which part it is.<br />All in all, the only thing I can say is this... \\"Wow!\\"  If you hate reading, if you hate or love rock'n roll, if you are a man or woman, if you are a monkey you will love this book and it is more than worth it to buy.  Trust me on this, okay?

Blade, assisted by a Nurse, His buddy Skipper(Or whatever) and his awesome arsenal of weapons must stop the vampires before it's to late. Great acting and storyline. Some of the best special effects I've ever seen. Unlike some geeky comic book movies, this movie isn't afraid to be gorey and scary. Also, great costumes and fighting scenes. U wouldn't wanna miss this.
B000000H4V|5.0|A monumental 90s metal album with the attitude of punk rock. Not as thrash as previous Sepultura albums but who cares, Max is as aggressive and angry as ever. Igor Cavalera's incredible tribal drumming style is the driving force behind Chaos Ad. It gives it another dimension that many other Death and Thrash metal bands lacked at the time. Yeah they've slowed the tempo down a bit but the rhythms are so powerful and complex, making every song on Chaos ad into a pummeling anthem. This album should only be played at full volume.
0671784560|4.0|I thought this novel was a wonderful introduction to the mindset of the Chinese people, both those living in China, and those living in America, towards the new government. It was an enlightening story because as an American, we view it simply as a government as one that took away everyone's freedoms, which it did. Yet, of course, it's not that simple. The story is about that deeply-rooted devotion to one's mother country, no matter what changes it goes through. It also reveals what led to the change of government, and what problems arised and what new changes occurred afterward. Through Madame Liang, representing the older revolutionary generation, the story showed how the revolution failed, and she saw how certain mistakes in history were made. Through her daughters, it showed the hope in which the younger generation had for the new China, and their attempts to restore a strong nation within the new framework. Also revealed was the the repression of emotions, through Grace, the eldest daughter, her hopeless lusting after Liu Peng, yet knowing that his mind was narrow and brainwashed in the Communist school of thought. Of course, the repression of individual thought was evident with John Sung, the scientist who refused to create weapons to be used against Americans. The stories surrounding Mercy and Joy, Madame Liang's two other daughters, was interesting in that they both struggled with their loyalties to China, but love, in Joy's case, kept her in America, while experience in the new China, forced Mercy to escape. There were a lot of interesting themes throughout the story, the theme of love in light of this new way of life, the theme of pride in one's own race and country. The style in which the story was told was very different from that of \\"The Good Earth.\\" Here it was a much more fast-moving narrative, and a great modern story.<br />I couldn't put this book down, but there's just one thing that bothered me, and that was the ending, which seemed so abrupt. All of a sudden certain events happened which bluntly put the entire story to an end. Certainly these events were convincing, yet it still left me completely shocked and almost disappointed once the novel was finished. That's the only reason why I gave it four stars.of a sudden certain events happened which bluntly put the entire story to an end.

B000005RFQ|4.0|My girlfriend hates heavy metal, but loves this album.  This tells me something.<br />This album is not for everyone, especially die-hard Black Sabbath fans who want the band's sound and image to be set in stone and unchangeable.  The Ozzy era was classic, the Dio period distinct for diferent reasons... and then Born Again comes along.<br />Ian Gillan himself admits \\"I was the worst singer Black Sabbath ever had.\\"  I whole-heartedly disagree.  In terms of raw talent he's the top of the bunch, though his vocal style is admittedly more suited to Deep Purple or Jesus Christ Superstar than Black Sabbath.  Too much screaming, which while impressive, does nothing for the over-all effect.  He also wrote the lyrics for this album, and they are deceidedly \\"un-Sabbath.\\"  No doom and gloom nuclear devistation/drug abuse/dark occultism here; half of the songs are about women.  The production is still muddy (the \\"Remastering\\" is unnoticeable; I suspect there's a lot of subtlety lurking in the original mix, but it's hard to pick it out.)  Plus the cover looks like a Terry Gilliam cartoon from Monty Python's Flying Circus.<br />That said, I *LOVE* this album.  The band is tight, Iommi has a guitar tone I'd give my incisors for, and Ian Gillan is, well, Ian Gillan.<br />It's a good, solid album, but not for everyone.  This is an album you either love or hate. You should probably preview the tracks a few times before getting it.  I think \\"Trashed\\" alone makes it worth buying, but \\"Disturbing the Priest\\" is downright creepy and \\"Zero the Hero\\" is a monster track (I am endlessly amused that Danzig and Guns & Roses \\"borrowed\\" the main lick for \\"Her Black Wings\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" respectively.)<br />Like my review title says: this is not a good \\"Black Sabbath\\" album, but it's a great \\"rock\\" album.

B000067DNC|5.0|I saw Stargate the movie and wasn't very impressed, but from the first time I saw an episode of SG-1, I was hooked. Stargate SG-1 is one of the greatest Sci-Fi TV series of all time. In my book the only thing that could beat it is Star Trek TNG. And this DVD series is much more affordable than it's Star Trek counterpart. <BR>I was so excited when I found out they had the first two seasons of this on DVD. I went out and bought them immediately. All the tiny little nitpicks I had about the Season 1 set were solved in this one. Season 2 is a great season and the DVD set reflects that. I love the extras. The featurettes are all really interesting, although a couple more wouldn't have hurt, and we're still waiting for a Jack O'Neil one. I also think an audio commentary track on these episodes would be really great, but I can understand that that would be a huge undertaking. These DVDs are terrific and I'm counting the days till Season 3.
0380789035|5.0|Reading other people's reviews, this seems to be a love it or hate it book.  I can see how, for those who don't find the many supernatural characters interesting, American Gods could seem long and boring.  For myself, I thought it was the best book I had read all year.<br />Shadow, the protagonist, is a man who although physically imposing, has the most low key character imaginable.  This puts him in a unique position to relay to the reader, through his own experiences, the events in this story, from the wildly supernatural to the incredibly mundane.  And both of these extremes exist in American Gods, for sure.  But Gaiman's writing is so real that even the mundane, such as a quaint little Wisconsin town in winter, comes vividly to life in a way that makes it interesting.  His characters are real, even the gods, who seem far more human than superhuman - which is apropos for the tale the author tells.<br />Although 600 pages in length, this book felt shorter than many 250-pagers I've read recently.  The momentum is nearly constant from beginning to end, and the settings and characters unforgettable.  I would recommend this to almost anyone.  You'll never believe that the out-of-the-way corners of America could be so interesting!
B000083E79|5.0|This is the 1st US Very Best of Cher, including her most recent hits. <BR>In fact, theres a previous Australian CD, also released in Argentina, chart topper outside the US, with nearly the same <BR>collection of tracks, except for &quot;Song for the lonely&quot; &amp; &quot;Different kind of love song&quot; as it was released just before<BR>&quot;Living proof&quot;. <BR>I celebrate that Americans are now enjoying this wonderful CD, as I usually have the impression  that Cher is always much better admired/appreciated abroad than in her own country; just as an  example: &quot;Believe&quot; topped the charts of nearly 12 countries before topping the US chart.
B000083E79|5.0|Youll enjoy this CD completely, youll feel the energy of her uptempo techno-pop tracks or her heavier songs, the songs telling stories, her ballads, and there is a lot more of the gretest todays singer impossible to include it all in just one CD. Highly recommended!!!!!
B000083E79|5.0|It would be necessary a 3 or 4 CD Box to contain all of the very best of Cher, not only her greatest-greatest hits, and so we would be able to listen wonderful songs in each and every pop &amp; rock music style by the most interesting, gifted and versatile of today´s female singers. <br />I´ve seen that this CD is number 4 on its 5th week on Billboard hot 100 albums chart, by the same time I read, and I cannot believe this, that Cher´s label has dropped her. It simply makes no sense. <BR>But it´s not a matter to worry about, because sure new recordings will soon appear on another label, and the eclectic world wide mega-star will surprise all of us once again with a different kind of sound; personally I´d like to listen to her again on ballads, either high energy power ballads (as those from her Geffen years) or soft ballads (as &quot;Piú Che Puoi&quot; the one she recorded duetting with Eros Ramazzotti -great hit in Italy and some other countries- in between her &quot;Believe&quot; &amp; &quot;Living Proof&quot; techno/dance albums. Waiting for more from  the best.
1573228737|5.0|AFFINITY by Sarah Waters<br />After reading Sarah Waters' wonderfully written book FINGERSMITH, I had to get a hold of her other two novels TIPPING THE VELVET and AFFINITY.  As with FINGERSMITH, I came away from AFFINITY with a very satisfied feeling of having read yet another great book.  AFFINITY is a complex story set in Victorian England about a young woman, Margaret Prior, who has been suffering from bouts of depression and loneliness. She has just suffered from a breakdown shortly after her father's death, and because of a suicide attempt, her mother, with the hopes of making a full recovery keeps her secluded in the house and administered with medications.<BR> <BR>When it is suggested that Margaret visit the local woman's gaol (prison) as a form of therapy, she agrees and begins her frequent visits.  She is known as a \\"lady visitor\\", one of many that come to the prisons to read and talk to the prisoners as a form of goodwill and charity.  Soon she finds herself meeting and conversing with the various women that are being held in this gaol.  She meets women from all walks of life and sees the horrible conditions in which they now live.  And then she meets Selina Dawes. Margaret takes extra notice of this quiet sad woman. The reader immediately knows that she finds Selina special, and soon she becomes obsessed with the prisoner, and her story.  It is all she can think of day and night. It becomes her life.<br />Selina Dawes is a medium, who is able to talk to the dead and perform acts of the paranormal.  She is in prison due to the death of a friend of hers, Mrs. Brink, who allowed Selina to live with her as she helped Mrs. Brink contact the netherworld.  Mrs. Brink died during one of Selina's paranormal sessions, and is being charged for assault and fraud.  Learning about Selina's \\"crime\\", Margaret is in total sympathy with Selina and knows that Selina is in prison for a crime she did not commit, and soon the two become close.<br />The viewpoints of both womenare seen through the journals of each of them respectively.  Selina's journal-entries lead to the day of the supposed crime, while Margaret's journal takes us through the present story.  And, as the book becomes more and more complicated, the journals begin to reveal more and more secret thoughts of these two women. The ending, as with FINGERSMITH, will totally shock the reader.  Sarah Waters is the master of the double-twisted plot device, and although the story started on a slow note, the pace of the book picked up and did not let up until the very last page.  Beautifully written with subtle undertones of lesbianism, this reviewer highly recommends AFFINITY.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I have fond memories of seeing \\"Logan's Run\\" in the theaters many years ago, and am delighted to see this film getting a fine presentation on DVD.  Directed by Michael Anderson, the film takes place in a post-apocalyptic future where humans live a hedonistic life in the shelter of a domed city.  There's just one catch to this pleasure-oriented utopia: nobody is permitted to live past the age of 30.  The title character, played by Michael York, is a Sandman: an elite policeman assigned to kill those who flee the birthday death sentence.  But a surprising assignment takes Logan on a voyage that will change him profoundly.<br />\\"Logan's Run\\" is an adventure tale, a love story, a crime drama, a social satire, and a sumptuous visual spectacle all in one.  The whole package is superbly enhanced by Jerry Goldsmith's inventive and varied score.  This is one of the most visually stylish science fiction films ever made; it's full of scenes that are truly unforgettable.<br />The film is really grounded by the performances by the superb cast.  Michael York and Jenny Agutter make an absolutely enchanting screen couple; the evolution of their characters' relationship is one of the key pleasures of the film.  Richard Jordan brings complexity and intensity to his role as a fellow Sandman.  And Peter Ustinov is delightfully warm, funny, and loveable in a critical supporting role.<br />The DVD includes a vintage \\"making of\\" featurette, as well as a full-length audio commentary by actor York, director Anderson, and costume designer Bill Thomas.  The three discuss casting, stunts, special effects, Peter Ustinov's ad-libbing, and other aspects of making the film.  They reveal some fascinating and delightful bits of trivia along the way.  This is one of those great commentary tracks that makes you appreciate the film even more.

The group plays through an eclectic selection of material including all of their hits charted up until that point.  Highlights include solid versions of &quot;Beginnings&quot; and &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot;, the latter preceded by an inspired avante-garde piano solo section featuring Bobby Lamm.  <BR>There is a lot of jamming on this CD, with guitarist Terry Kath given lots of room to stretch out and show his chops.  Great extended versions of &quot;South California Purples&quot;, &quot;Sing a Mean Tune Kid&quot; and &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; are true documents of Kath's unique guitar prowess that seemed to get lost in Chicago's later recording efforts.<BR>Superb drummer Danny Seraphine and Peter Cetera on bass really cook on most of the tracks, walking a nice line between rock and jazz in their approach to laying down a rhythmic foundation for the band. Danny has always had a reputation in the music industry as a cutting edge musician on his instrument, but Peter, best known for his polished tenor as an 80's balladeer, is often forgotten as a bassist.  He truly shines on this live outing, and this disc is worth a listen just as a reminder of Peter Cetera's first-rate musicianship.<BR>The disc does suffer from a few flaws, however.  First, and foremost, is the recorded mix of the band.  True, this album  was recorded live in 1971, but it seems whoever was involved in the engineering  of the recording had a lot to learn.  The mix is very dry and the separation of the instruments and vocals in the stereo mix is weak.  The horns are separated so much that they have no blend, with Jimmy Pankow's trombone sounding like a kazoo isolated on the left side of the mix.<BR>The other problem is that, despite some terrific renditions of most of the tunes, a few of the performances are less than stellar.  &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; sounds tired and  lumbering, only saved by a cool Terry Kath guitar solo.<BR>&quot;Make Me Smile&quot;, another of Chicago's Top Ten hits, finds Terry Kath practically screaming the lead vocal, shunning any attempt to blend with the background vocal arrangements.<BR>These are minor criticisms, as &quot;Chicago At Carnegie Hall&quot; is an essential CD for anyone interested in this great band and how they were breaking musical ground in the early'70's while maintaining an enormous level of popularity that was to continue for years to come.<BR>Essential Chicago.
B00008LDPU|5.0|the importance of good story lines.<br />The CG animation, with diverse style, is excellent. However, if you are not one of those true matrix or sci fi fans, you may not be able to appreciate the whole DVD in 100%. My wife kept on asking me why this why that and I could not satisfy her in her understandable language, though she likes the movie still (even without Keanu). The stories, which distinguished this DVD from tons of other CG OVA in rental shops, are short but great. It should be viewed as a supplement to the Matrix trilogy, I believe, though I dont know what Reloaded and Revolution are all about yet.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|With the release of their seventh record, Chicago quashed the opinions of their critics who, after the release of \\"VI\\" snubbed the band for going \\"pop\\". Along with \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" and \\"Chicago II\\", \\"Chicago VII\\" is considerd by many (and this reviewer especially) to be a document of the legendary group at their finest. <BR>This disc originally produced three hit singles while finding the band playing, for the first time, through some true jazz compositions. Chicago had been known for infusing some jazz style into their rock/pop sound in the past, but this was really their first stab at tackling real jazz instrumentals. <BR>\\"Chicago VII\\" opens with \\"Prelude to Aire\\" and \\"Aire\\" with interesting rhythmic percussion creating a backdrop for Walt Parazaider's flute and the horn section to blow loose and free.  Terry Kath shows off a new side of his style with more of a warmer tone during an extended solo section.  As an ensemble Chicago has never displayed more musical skill than on \\"Devil's Sweet\\".  Written by drummer Danny Seraphine, the horns play lightly over some intriguing brushwork technique Danny apparently wanted to show off.  He then propels the band into a double time section and every individual musician just cooks. Peter Cetera's basswork  and Terry Kath's rhythm guitar parts are just electrifying and Danny Seraphine is simply outrageous. <BR>These compositions alone make \\"Chicago VII\\" a MUST for anyone interested in this great band.<BR>The rest of the songs on the disc are all strong and display a true diversity of styles.  From the funky \\"Woman Don't Want To Love Me\\" and \\"Skinny Boy\\" to the warm ballad textures of the classic \\"Happy Man\\", there is no low point on this disc.  <BR>Then there are the singles, which stand out as some of Chicago's finest work: the crisp and energetic \\"Call On Me\\" (terrific horn chart by trumpeter Lee Loughnane who wrote the tune); the moody and lush \\"Searchin' So Long\\"; and \\"Wishing You Were Here\\", arguably Peter Cetera's finest song he ever wrote with or without Chicago, with the Beach Boys brought in to create some wonderful vocal textures. Just terrific.<BR>Overall, \\"Chicago VII\\" is just that: terrific.<BR>Essential Chicago, not to be overlooked.
0393317552|3.0|Despite the fact that Jared Diamond won the Pulitzer Prize for this book, I would beg to differ that this books is all that it is worked up to be.  At points, it is down right confusing; at other points, it is so full of elucidation that you tend to get bored.<br />One thing that irked me about this book, is that in the preface, Diamond refutes the fact that his books is rooted in environmental determinism (the belief that all human actions/history are directly dictated by the physical environment) yet a majority of the book is about how the environment shaped which societies created \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel.\\"  I am not saying that his view is wrong (his ideas about why the Fertile Crescent were nothing short of great) but I am saying that, despite his belief that this books is not, this book is highly influenced by the E.D. beliefs.<br />I also took note that a few times in the book, Diamond made some conjectures that were totally off base.  For example, he brings up the patriotic hymn for America the Beautiful where he paraphrased it by saying \\"'American the Beautiful' invokes our spacious skies, our amber waves of grain, from sea to shining sea.\\"  He uses this shortened version to say that American never had amber waves of grain from sea to shining sea, thus, proving that American grain was founded elsewhere. Not only does the song NOT say that America had grain from the Pacific to the Atlantic, but who would have ever thought such a thing?<br />I will not deny that this book was extremely well thought through, and that it had some important things to point out when it comes to the history of the world, but to me it was nothing special.  It was more advanced than a textbook, and written in a coherent manner for the most part.  I enjoyed some parts, but really, it was a struggle to get through.<br />I give it three stars for 1) pointing out that Zebras are moody and cannot be domesticated, 2) covering 13,000 years in under 500 pages, and 3) for winning the Pulitzer.
B000002MTR|3.0|This CD has its up's and down's, I'll admit it.  Dave Nevarro's guitar playing never really ties in, as he's from the similar-sounding (but not enough so to fit in with RHCP) alt-metal band Jane's Addiction.  &quot;Warped&quot; has a good intro, but gets tired quickly.  &quot;Aeroplane,&quot; &quot;My Friends&quot;, and &quot;Shallow Be Thy Game&quot; are all decent songs, but nothing here is fresh or ingenuitive enough to spark a purchase from anyone but hardcore fans.  Oh, and &quot;Coffee Shop&quot; just blows completely;  Flea's bass solo is the only thing that keeps it from destroying your ears.
B000089RVX|5.0|everytime i put this cd in a play it, it amazes me each time. i listen to every song twice amy's voice is amazing its haunting, dark, beautiful. its about time a band came out with a cd that has an effect on people. my fav tracks r Going under, Tourniquet, of course bring me to live, haunted, taking over me, hello, and The beatiful, my immortal
B000067CPX|4.0|This is great music, with beautiful vocals, excellent guitar playing, etc.  It never goes for the loud, distorted feel; always the breathtakingly well-complimenting harmony.  It's kind of odd to think that this is the same band that released the loud, dirty, and forgettable &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; just seven years before.  The music and vocals all seem so sophisticated.  This is truly a great piece of music.  However, you may be somewhat turned off if you (like me) enjoyed the older music, with Flea's awesome slap bass or Keidis's (occassionally uninterpritable as they were) naughty rhymes.  I still enjoy and appreciate this album, but it just doesn't reach me like the old stuff.  Honestly, though, there isn't a poorly-done song on here, even though I really can't stand &quot;On Mercury.&quot;  Enjoy!
6304595247|3.0|This is the second time I've seen a screen adaptation of Emily Bronte's WUTHERING HEIGHTS in the past month. It's not that I'm a Bronte fan. Decidedly not. But I wanted to compare this 1992 version starring Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes with the 1970 production starring Anna Calder-Marshall and Timothy Dalton. An intellectual exercise, if you will.<br />OK, ok. I just wanted to ogle Juliette Binoche.<br />I've never actually read WUTHERING HEIGHTS, and never will. So, my understanding of this 19th century soap comes entirely from the two films. A landed Yorkshire gentleman, Mr. Earnshaw, brings home a young orphan boy, whom he names Heathcliff, to live at WUTHERING HEIGHTS with his family, which includes daughter Cathy and son Hindley. Heathcliff and Cathy spend their formative years roaming the wild moors, and become devoted to each other. When the elder Earnshaw dies, Hindley, who hates Heathcliff, demotes him to servant status. In the meantime, Cathy picks up the ways of a lady during a lengthy stay in the manor house of the local magistrate, Mr. Linton, where she first meets his son, Edgar. Returning to WH, Cathy is put off by Heathcliff's roughness and poor hygiene. Now, in short order, Hindley's wife dies giving birth to son Hareton; Edgar proposes to Cathy; Heathcliff disappears; Cathy marries Edgar; Heathcliff returns after years \\"on the road\\", now cleaned up and moneyed; Heathcliff exacts vengeance on the Earnshaws and the Lintons.<br />The most obvious difference between the '70 and '92 versions is that the former considerably foreshortens the original Bronte plot, and ends with the death of Cathy shortly after she gives birth to her daughter, Catherine Linton. In that interpretation, Heathcliff (Dalton) pines away from loss and soon joins her. In the more recent version, Heathcliff (Fiennes) lives on many years to make life miserable for the second generation, i.e. Catherine, Hareton, and his own son, Linton, by Edgar's sister, Isabella. (Why couldn't Heathcliff have named his son \\"Bob\\", just to keep the numerous Lintons straight in my mind?)<br />The '92 WH suffers considerably from only superficially touching on the early years of Heathcliff and Cathy when they came to love each other while running wild over the Dales. It's that bond, broken by Cathy's marriage to Edgar, that causes Heathcliff to snap. Because the '70 version dwells more extensively on these \\"missing\\" years, this viewer felt a modicum of sympathy for Dalton's Heathcliff when he gets ugly. The Fiennes Heathcliff simply comes across as a psycho, though the intensity of the actor's portrayal makes his Heathcliff truly scary.<br />I can't get enough of Juliette Binoche, so her dual roles as both Cathy and her daughter Catherine gave her enough screen time to satisfy even me. Well, perhaps casting her first as a brunette and then a blonde was a bit contrived. But Lady Clairol manages that thousands of times every day, so who am I to quibble?<br />I'm giving this version of WUTHERING HEIGHTS three stars not because it's lacking in itself, but in relation to the '70 version, which gets the plot's message across in a simpler manner, and to which I gave four stars. Emily Bronte's storyline is just so depressing as it is. If I'm going to watch a chick flick, give me an amusing piece based on a frivolous Jane Austen book. At least it's sunnier in the south of England.<br />And by the way. What did they farm at WUTHERING HEIGHTS, anyway? Sheep, I suppose. But it may as well have been rocks since we see more of those than wool-on-the-hoof.t Heathcliff have named his son \\"Bob\\", just to keep the numerous Lintons straight in my mind?)<br />The '92 WH suffers considerably from only superficially touching on the early years of Heathcliff and Cathy when they came to love each other while running wild over the Dales.

B00008PX8P|3.0|Since everyone else is rating this DVD sight unseen, guess I might as well jump in, too.<br />I'll give it three stars 'cause it contains some of their great pre-1973 material.<br />Gotta deduct two stars for including anything from the Song Remains the Same tour. I saw one of the shows on that tour, and later saw the movie culled from the Madison Square Garden show of that tour, and both were terrible. Zep by that time was resting on their laurels, and/or too stoned to care.<br />I also saw them perform on their first US tour in 1970, at a little community center in Falls Church, Virginia. They were unbelievably good. For Jimmy Page to say they were always underground simply isn't true. Througout the release of that first album, yes. About halfway through the year LZ II was released they became rock and roll stars and started acting like them, too. Not that they didn't continue to record some great material but - and here again I have to disagree with Mr Page - they were no longer all that great a live band, much better in the studio. Just the opinion of a devoted Zep fan ...
630336568X|5.0|A former green beret (Stallone) journeys into the northwest on foot to find an old army buddy who he finds has passed away. He walks into the nearest town to get a bite to eat but the sheriff (Brian Dennehy) doesn't want his kind around. He gives Rambo a ride out of town and informs him the next town is only 30 miles away. Rambo doesn't have to take this. He turns around and heads back but Dennehy sees him doubling back, arrests him and takes him to the police station. He gets fingerprinted, then they decide he needs a shave and this is where all the trouble starts. He has flashbacks from Vietnam and sees the Vietcong holding a razor to his face and goes berserk. He gets away, steals a motorcycle and heads for the mountains. Dennehy goes after him but ends up crawling out of his vehicle while it sits perched upside down. Now the manhunt begins, only the odds are in Rambo's favor (\\"those green berets, they're real badasses\\"). Rambo is skilled in every facet of guerilla warfare. Six cops with rifles and three dogs just aren't enough. Before it's all over Rambo has caused enough destruction to declare the place a disaster area. And it all started because some cop (Dennehy)wouldn't let him stop in town and get something to eat (\\"Why you pushin' me\\"?). Plenty of action. Dennehy plays his usual part; hard nosed and stubborn. It's his way or no way, regardless of the consequences. David Caruso is a deputy in this movie and Richard Crenna is Rambo's former Colonel. Acted well by all.
B000021YQV|4.0|First off, I recommend this cd to anyone who likes modern rock. All the tracks are listenable, and I usually go through the cd nonstop. The only problem is that System of a Down isn't all that musical. They tune down their instruments down one step, then just hammer away with no effort. While I do appreciate this album, it doesn't offer that much musical talent.
B000060MMI|5.0|My boyfriend sent me this last year during finals week.  Damn him (just kidding).  Within the first day of getting it I burned out the batteries on my discman from listening to it continuously over and over.  It's a harder-edged and angrier sound than Swagger, but just as good, and just like Swagger it's impossible to sit still while listening to it.  Great!
B00005B36H|5.0|I'm still debating which album is better, Aenema or Lateralus. This album possesses some of the most original songs, and helps to establish the great musical talent of this band. Maynard's voice is great, as always. Danney Carey's drumming is some of the best I've ever heard, especially on Ticks &amp; Leeches.
B00006F83Y|3.0|this cd was catchy, i loved the metal influenced tracks.  No One Knows and the Sky Is Falling are my personal favorites.  but it didn't manage to stay in my cd player for very long.
B00006690G|1.0|Why do people such as Eminem become famous? Is it that today's music audience will buy anything with shock value? So what if Eminem can offend just about anybody? So what if he can put words together so that they sound somewhat melodic? People, this is not music, because music requires talent. Talking fast is not talent. Does Eminem actually play an instrument that could create some form of music?? NO. <BR>I am especially disgusted with \\"Sing for the Moment\\" which completely rips off Aerosmith's \\"Dream On.\\" Most of the people I know listen to this self-congladulatory, unoriginal music and say that this version is better than Aerosmith's. Come on. I guess this is where music is going: down a sad state where people will listen to anything that they can bob their heads to, dance to, and pretend to look cool listening to.
B00005QG9J|3.0|well at the risk of sounding juvenile, i'm going to quote an inside joke between me and my best friend, \\"they must have been on the munchies!\\"... and indeed they must have been.  I loved Incubus back on S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself, but now they seem slow, melodic and shall i say it, boring? their catchy hook that enables them to be driven and heavy without being nu-metalish is gone, and unfortunately, that's what drew me into Incubus.  i call this their experimentation album...after all, every band has one sooner or later, and it's usually right before they release their heaviest, crunchiest and most bad...album.
6300183211|5.0|Brillant film, I was hooked from the start of this film. It follows the premise of a Cuban exile named Tony Montana (amazing performance by Al Pacino) who builds his status as a drug dealer. I admit, some scenes in this film were hard to watch, especially the chainsaw scene and the hanging from a helicopter part, but they just add to the darkness of this film. Michelle Pheiffer puts in a great performance as Tony's coke-snorting wife, someone who offers nothing to the world (sort of like my sister, who sits around all day and watches trading spaces!) How does anyone snort so much coke??? How many f-bombs are blurted in this movie? Who cares! It all adds to the rebel image of Tony Montana, someone that we'd all like to mimick. I wish I could stand up to that much pressure, and still have attitude. And yes, \\"Say hello to my little friend\\" is the greatest movie quote of all time.
1565847032|5.0|This is a great introduction to the thinking of a great man.  It is fun, easy to read, and totally eye-opening.  The format is revolutionary (i.e., putting the footnotes online and letting them exceed the length of the text to give overwhelming proof to every controversial statement).  The style of the book is great, because it mixes humor with utterly serious political analysis.<br />The importance of the ideas cannot be overstated, particularly during these times of &quot;Bush-hero&quot; and &quot;top gun&quot;.  Anyone who cares about the world and is tired of the cheerleader media should do themselves a favor and read this book.
B000002H33|5.0|People often underestimate Metallica...Another thing I don't get is the unintelligent image that people often associate with Metallica, a bunch of mindless heagbangers with tedious lyrics and no music ability.<BR>This critics obviously have never listened to Master of Puppets, the greatest piece of rock ever established. Every one of these songs is a masterpiece, crafted brillantly with the talented bunch of musicians that form Metallica, James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and the late Cliff Burton.<BR>What I love is how the music in this album flows so well. Solos are all orchestrated to fit the mood of each song, especially in songs such as Master of Puppets and Disposable Heroes. <BR>Battery: Great speed metal song that opens with spanish guitars, I actually prefer the S&M version. 10/10.<br />Master of Puppets: One of the most brillant Metallica songs, metaphorically referring to the evils of drug addiction. Really showcases Metallica's musical ability.     10/10<br />The thing that should not be: Great song that sounds like it came from a horror movie. Once again, I prefer the S&M version.<BR>     10/10<BR>Sanitarium (welcome home): A lot lighter than the other songs on this cd, but still brings us to a great conclusion, making this song complete.   10/10<br />Disposable Heroes: Along with Leper Messiah, my favorite song on this cd. Very anti-war, suggests that war destroys a person's life. Speed metal never sounded so good.   10/10<br />Leper Messiah: Refers to corrupted people in religion (such as the 700 club) who use religion just to get people's money. I think they got this idea from the indulgences that were sold in the ancient church. Still, angst filled, brillant emotional lyrics, great musicmanship.     10/10<br />Orion: Instrumental, highlights the abilities of Cliff Burton, who we will all miss.       10/10<br />Damage Inc.: Why not a little speed metal to end this masterpiece? Refers to senseless violence, another track that hooks you.10/10
B00006GO9Q|5.0|This album would have to rank as the perfect album to a perfect summer's day. It is hypnotically beautiful and takes you to places you've never been before. Tony Williams' hi-hats in the title track provides the mood for the album and all the musicians make an incredible contribution. Oh, and Miles is on fire.
6300147630|3.0|I saw the cover for this movie and said to myself, &quot;Hey, this looks kinda cool.&quot; So I rented it. Aside from the one guy's head exploding (one of my favorite scenes of all time) and the mind battle at the end, this movie didn't offer a whole lot. There was probably something wrong with the tape I rented, because it looked like the voices were dubbed, which also hurt this movie-watching experience. Still, the head exploding scene is great....
B000069AUI|2.0|I think coldplay have succeded in writing some of the most boring, generic, and above all meaningless lyrics yet seen in rock. But I usually don't mind, as they've also written some rather good melodies. On this particular album however the music seems to have followed suit and is, with the exeption of Clocks, also rather boring. Then again, if you liked the singles, i'd suggest you buy it, as 'In My Place' shows them at about their worst.
6304509154|3.0|I've seen this movie a couple of times on various television stations, and it just isn't that scary. Maybe the premise of a girl getting sucked into a t.v. is scary to some, but not me. The reason I give this 3 stars is the scene where the guy is ripping his face off. I still get chills from that scene, and after watching it, I have a hard time sleeping
0385504209|4.0|I won't hesitate to say I loved this book. It has a good plot and it's almost impossible to put down. I enjoyed the anti-Christian theme. I also went and looked at the fresco of the Last Supper and everything Brown talks about in the book is in that painting. It was a well put-together novel. If I had to say anything bad about it, it would be that the ending needed work. It let me down. If the characters had found the Grail, it would have fit in with the mostly unbelieveable plot. All in all, a great read and probably one of the best books I've ever read.
B00008H2LE|1.0|i dont understand why people listen to this. Its so plain.  All of their songs really do sound the same.  Linkin park is the biggest formula band ive ever heard.  They found what works to sell records for them and re did it for every song with a slightly different tune.  sorry but i just dont get why you would think this is good at all.
B000066NW0|4.0|Okay...first let me say that i cant stand Avril. I think her attitude is obnoxious and annoying. She said she was punk, and then after the backlash, said she never said she was. She claims she writes her songs, when she actually wirtes with a producing team consisting of THREE people. Thats more people than the songs Britney writes, and people think she is so untalented. But, I haev to say that I think Avril's songs are really good. So heres what I think of each cong:<br />1. Losing Grip: 4/5. Tries to hard sound rock, but pretty good.<br />2. Complicated: 4/5. i know we heard this song so many times on every single readio station, but I think its cute and catchy. and its what made her famous right?<br />3. Sk8er Boi: 5/5. I love this song. It's the only song by Avril that actually sounds punk-rock.<br />4. I'm With You: 5/5. I think this song is beautfil. The lyrics are great, though i doubt Avril wrote any if it, but its a really great song.<br />5. Mobile: 3/5. Boring...thats all I have to say...<br />6. Unwanted: 4/5. I didnt like it at first, but now I do. It actually sounds rock.<br />7. Tomorrow: 3/5. Kinds boring, but acoutic sounding, which I love.<br />8. Anything But Ordinary: 1/5. The WORST song on the album. The lyrics are stupid, the music is dull, and the song is plain horrible!<br />9. Thing's I'll Never Say. 3/5. This is one of the songs that show how un-rock Avril is. This song is more pop than the latest music form Britney and Mandy. (Which isn't bad, but just contridicts what Avril says about herself.)<br />10. My World: 5/5. I love this song! It's really cute and catchy.<br />11. Nobody's Fool: 4/5. She's basicaly tlaking on this track, but I think it's a really cool song. I like it alot.<br />12. Too Much too Ask: 4/5. I like this song alot. A little more rock than Thing's I'll Never Say.<br />13. Naked: 3/5. Kinda dark, but it's a good song. <br />Well, thats what I think of 'Let Go.' I think it's worth the money even though Avril is so annoying! haha.
B000089CJI|5.0|And I say that because the Postal Service, in spite of its obscure/boring-sounding name is an excellent collaboration between these two guys from seperate bands (don't ask me to get into specifics, I just picked up the CD without any prior listening experience of these bands). If you like synthesizer noises and eighties/early 90's music like ... the Lightning Seeds, Modern English, Psychedelic Furs even When in Rome, then take a listen to these guys. They kind of put the old in with the new and make it sound, well, cool. The vocalist reminds me of Ben Folds from the Ben Folds Five in the way that he sings. I also found the lyrics well-written, much like poetry and witty musings: &quot;I have to speculate that God did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces ...&quot; (from &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;) Anyway, just give it a listen-to. I was very happy for buying it and didn't feel like I had wasted my money AT ALL.
B00003CXCK|5.0|A true masterpiece and of such nature that one must own it and show it to anyone who will watch...
B00008PW3Q|5.0|From time to time we all wish something new from bands considered to be long in the tooth, such as Fleetwood Mac. Christine McVie and her dark alto is missing from this collection, but this album is still an excellent entry into the vast Fleetwood Mac catalog. Excellent material all around giving this album a gloss Buckingham/Nicks tried but never achieved. I am a big fan of Stevie's and a casual fan of Lindsay's, but we all know they work much better as a group than solo, keeping each other's turn to musical eclectisicm in check.  Stevie as always, sounds wonderful and Lindsay offers his tender harmonies on their duets. &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; is the breakaway hit, &quot;Say You Will&quot; might find it's way to radio, but most of these tracks are not meant for radio consumption and that's the beauty of this album. Non commercial and art in it's truest form. May you never break the chain..........
B0000931QR|5.0|&quot;Dile al Sol&quot; su primer album es bueno, &quot;El viaje de Copperport&quot; es buenisimo pero este nuevo album es excelente! Todas y cada una de las canciones de este cd son magnificas. Es un CD el cual cada vez que lo escuchas mas te va gustando. Si te gustaron sus trabajos anteriores les garantizo no se van a arrepentir de este nuevo cd &quot;Las cosas que te conte mientras te hacias la dormida&quot;. Una joya del pop-rock en espanol.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Sure, this is a good movie, and the DVD doesn't dissapoint.  Great addition to a movie collection.
B000062YAZ|5.0|This is the first Slayer cd i got, and it took me a while to get into it. But after i did get into it, i couldnt stop listning to it. Angel Of Death is the only song I really liked my first listen, but after i got used to it liked all of the other songs. Now I have all of the Slayer cds. Slayer is definetly one of my favorite bands. I have to say that i like Diabolus and God Hates Us All better, but the older thrash stuff is impossible to get tired of, so even if they did change, you wont get tired of this or South Of Heaven!   So stop [complaining] of the new way Tom sings!
B000003TAL|5.0|Let's face it people, Sonic Youth is simply one of the best bands of all time. Although they haven't always been consistent throughout their career, when they are good their music can hold up against anyone of their genre.  Daydream Nation was just the second pinnacle of their work.  Sister is also a classic, but for someone wanting to get introduced to a band in a whole other musical galaxy then listen to this record.  Sonic Youth simply never reached the heights of this record again and it seems almost impossible to.  Each song is of an extremely high quality.  To tell you the truth I stopped listening to this record awhile ago thinking it was great but over-rated.  I was very wrong.  Each song is intricate to the whole album's build up and each song is truly essential Sonic Youth listening.  If you don't get this album or think the effect of it has worn off of you as the years have passed, then that is fine.  Do yourself a favor though and put the album away for awhile and come back to it later like I did.  I tell you the album should seem just as magical as it did the day you first listened to it.
B000062YB1|5.0|Let me start of by saying that Skeletons Of Society is one of the best and most catchy songs by Slayer when they were thrash! But all of the songs on here rule!  I usally dont do this, but I am going to rate these songs on a scale of 1 to 10.<br />War Ensemble 10/10, one of my favorits on the album, great guitar work!<BR>Blood Red 5/10, awesome for abot the first 5 listens but after that it gets boring, great lyrics though.<BR>Spirit In Black 9/10, realy good, very catchy<BR>Expandable Youth 6/10, good, not a Standout though<BR>Dead Skin Mask 10/10, awesome guitars, awesome lyrics about Ed Gein<BR>Hallowed Point 3/10, i dont listen to this one too much<BR>Skeletons Of Society 10/10, best track on the cd<BR>Temptation 9/10, great lyrics<BR>Born Of Fire9/10, great rythym<BR>Seasons In The Abyss 5/10, i dont listento this one much<br />This is one of the best slayer cds, if you love Slayer you should already own this one though.
B00005B36H|2.0|I was a massive Tool fan in my early stages of music.  I really thought that they were the best band on the planet and I may have had some good reason.  Aenima was definitely a modern day classic and was worth my time, but everything else before really wasn't.  As the past couple years have gone by and my tastes have grown by leaps and bounds I am starting to realize that Lateralus simply isn't very good.  The songs just aren't as strong as they are on Aenima and the whole way their music sounds has taken a turn for the worse.  Tool is a band that really does end up relying on their guitar sound and everything else to get out their full musical message and I simply wasn't digging the extra &quot;crunchy&quot; guitar and everything else that was going on in the background.  Don't get me wrong, they are very talented musicians, but the production was weak this time around, I almost wonder if Botrill had turned sour after producing so many nu-metal albums.  Better production could have saved this record but it almost appears that they only wanted to please their fans this time around.  The metal heads will love this record, but a person who actually appreciates music of all kinds ranging from jazz to indie to rap to whatever should realize that the whole sound of this record just didn't work out.  The bright side to this record is that they are still far superior to most other &quot;metal&quot; that is out there nowadays.  Still, this record is very weak and we can only hope that one day this band will regain it's form and make at least one more great record.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Well, I love Christina's voice since she came out with \\"Genie In A Bottle\\". That CD was like heaven to me. But \\"Stripped\\" is even better because her vocals are like never before and the lyrics are sooo powerful. Review of every song below:<BR>1.Stripped(Intro)- Bunch of bits and pieces of interviews and thing's she's said.<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down - Great song for independent women. Features Lil' Kim. Nice beat for dancing.<BR>3. Walk Away - My favorite song in the whole CD. Strong and powerful vocals and lyrics. Gives me goosebumps. I love this song. Very slow and seirous<BR>4. Fighter - It's out now as her 3rd single. I also love this song. Shivering vocals and also strong, and honest lyrics.<BR>5. Infatuation(Intro)- Spoken intro to Infatuation. Spoken in Spanish with some latin music in the background.<BR>6. Infatuation - Really cool song about latin lovers. Dedicated to her ex Puerto Rican boyfriend.<BR>7. Loving Me For Me(Intro)- Really high pitched intro, makes me thing of a waterfall.<BR>8. Loving Me For Me - Really sweet song about loving people for who they are and not for what they have or what they do.<BR>9. Impossible - Awesome song featuring Alicia Keys, a great artists herself. Nice rythym and cool lyrics. Lyrics are about it being impossible to get \\"his\\" attention.<BR>10. Underappreciated - Really strong vocals. Meaning of the song is giving so much and not getting anything in return. One of my favorites.<BR>11. Beautiful - Her second single. Song is really played out on the radio but I love it. Really inspiring for when you're down.<BR>12. Make Over - Not like the regular Christina. It has some rockish and grunge to it. The song is about people trying to change her but she just wants to be herself.<BR>13. Cruz - I love this song, really nice vocals also. Slow song. This song is about leaving her normal life to live her dream.<BR>14. Soar - Inspiring song also, not slow but not crazy and danceable.<BR>15. Get Mine Get Yours - Cool melody. Also one ofmy favorites. Song is about getting some but not falling in love.<BR>16. Dirrty - I'm sure all of you have heard this song. Cool rythym, I like it.<BR>17. Stripped(Part 2)- Kind of like the first intro but this time she says sorry for everything she is and isn't. <BR>18. A Voice Within - Inspiring song telling you to listen to the voice that you have within. Slow song with strong singing.<BR>19. I'm OK - Very sad slow song. The song is about how her dad used to beat her and her mom.<BR>20. Singing My Song - OK song, not too wild about it.
0441003257|5.0|What a team!  This book is so terrific it amazes me that Pratchett & Gaiman haven't done another, but I guess they're too busy on their own projects.  I can't say anything that earlier reviewers haven't already said in praise of this hilarious and philosophically pointed novel--except to mention the wacky wordplay, very likely Terry Pratchett's.  As it happened, the first time I read the book I was studying the Welsh language and when I came across the quite authentic-sounding name of a Welsh town, Pant-y-Gyrdl, I nearly drowned in tears brought on by excessive laughter.  I suppose in our advanced era of Pant-y-Hos, that particular pun might go by without notice.  Too bad, but it's far from the only bit of wordplay that will make you giggle.   And sometimes stop and think, which is even nicer.
B00005B4GU|5.0|radiohead's album, Amnesiac, is a modern day masterpiece.  the band continually one-up themselves with every record.  most of the fodder that is released today has nothing to it.  the music is just meaningless sounds used to fill airwaves.  radiohead has something to say, and they find the most interesting methods of getting their messages across.

My husband knows this is my favorite movie, so he tried to surprise me with Annie for Valentine's Day last year. Unfortunately he bought the &quot;new&quot; Annie.

B00005YW4H|5.0|What a talented young woman!  I was surprised by two negative reviews (both from CA), but then that's the nature of opinions.  Norah's album &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; will grow on you.  You won't waste your money.  She deserves the Grammys!
0060278250|5.0|This wonderfully written book continues story so uniquely started in Sabriel and Lirael. <BR> Lirael(the mew Abhorsen-in-Waining) and Sameth (the Wallmaker) set out on the quest to save Nick (Sam's friend) and stop the digging that Nick and a necromancer Hedge start. Something evil is buried deep within the earth, something that should never see the light of day. <BR>Lirael and Sam are accompanied by mysterious Dog and sarcastic Mogget- Abhorsen's cat-shaped servant. As they approach the Red Lake where the digging is going they meet even more Dead Hands, Gore Crows and other dangers. Even to leave the Abhorsen's house they have to use the most dangerous way imaginable- through the  caves of the Sorrowful.<BR> One terrible mistake and the almost won battle is lost. The ancient force Orannis, the Ninth Bright Shiner, is dug up and shipped to Anselstiere. As Lirael and Sam try to catch up with Hedge, terrible news arrive- Sabriel (the Abhorsen) is dead. <BR> Now both Lirael and Sam must face their greatest fears to win this impossible battle.<BR> To defeat the terrible power even the Seven Bright Shiners could hardly imprison, the forces of Charter must ban together.

B0000931OG|5.0|As a fan of Blur's going back to the release of &quot;Leisure&quot;, I'd have to say that they've never made a better album than &quot;Think Tank&quot;.  This album is full of subtle beauty and has great mileage i.e. it's definitely not a buy it and put it on the shelf type album ala their eponymous mainstream smash.  This album is subtle and soulful but it's also extremely fun and great to listen to. An excellent album to listen to while tying one on with friends.  I hope that Blur continue on this path and I'd say that Coxon's departure is a blessing as his faux-American Indie guise was always off putting and slightly insulting to someone who is familiar with American Indie rock.  Just because your song is recorded poorly in a million dollar studio doesn't make it Lo-Fi.  This album is incredible.
B0000009SF|4.0|I get the feeling that while Frank was very good at writing for small ensembles of woodwinds, witness the quite incredible writing skills evident in Uncle Meat and Burnt Weeny Sandwich, he may have found the pieces here just a little harder. I guess we'll never really know, but on the whole, very few of these pieces (3, really) actualy use the manifold resources of the musicians mentioned in the flyleaf.<br />I have no idea, as a matter of fact, where the big band writing skills ever come from, since to get the sounds as you want, you have to have a very capable audition and there's only so many who can do that reasonably well. Take this with the possibility that Frank was indeed recovering from a quite bad accident and was a bit upset, and you can imagine that somewhere in the vaults there must surely be a lot of material that was recorded, or scripted, but didn't quite make his very high standards.<br />This collection is very nice, cheerful, and undoubtedly listenable. I could only really wish that there was more.<br />It doesn't seem to reveal much of the man who wrote the strange things earlier, but actually, it does after a few listenings, reveal some rather unorthodox ideas, but presented in quite a different way to anything else, even from the Hot Rats/Waka Jawaka set.<br />I wonder where this might all have headed if there had been the time.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna's growing interest in electronica over the past five years has resulted in some of the most interesting and creative work of her career. 1998's \\"Ray Of Light\\" saw the master of reinvention return to her throne as record sales soared, and with hits such as \\"Frozen\\" and \\"The Power Of Goodbye,\\" it's not in the least surprising. Riding high on her reclaimed success, the icon released \\"Music\\" in 2000, an album that topped the charts in 26 countries and sold 14 million copies with smash hits such as the title track and \\"Don't Tell Me.\\" All this creative excellence and bold decision making has now resulted in her most daring and maybe most controversial record to date, American Life.<br /><br />Teaming up once again with techno whizz Mirwaiz Ahmadzai, Madonna has produced a colourful and rich album that still manages to be incredibly accessible and simple. Where \\"Music\\" was an album that aimed to be easy on the brain and heavy on the hips, \\"American Life\\" opens with the thought-provoking and politically correct title track. From the opening lines, it's clear that we've caught the one-time Material Girl in a reflective state of mind. The song co-ordinates from harsh techno beats to an acoustic chorus that sounds almost lullaby, in which we realise Madonna is not surveying american life on the whole, but just her own experiences of it. And then, taking any casual listener by surprise, Madonna begins to rap! \\"I got a lawyer and a manager, an agent and a chef. Three nannies, an assistant and a driver and a jet. A trainer and a butler and a bodyguard or five, a gardener and a stylist. Do you think I'm satisfied?\\" she wails. And we now know that it's not always been an easy ride for Madonna, and that while she may have everything she thought she wanted, she may not have everything she has needed.<br /><br />\\"Hollywood\\" is a brilliant slice of pop/dance perfection that sparkles with shiny synths, and a sure-fire radio hit in the coming months, while \\"Love Profusion\\" has a killer beat with some very touching and emotional lyrics that seem to fit the form of a love letter to a certain Mr Ritchie. These songs both prove that no matter how much experimentation or indeed, reinvention Madonna tries her hand at, nothing gets in her way of creating flawless pop songs. From here on, Madonna meditates on religion, (the stunning \\"Nothing Fails,\\" a classic in its own right and her most personal song for more than a decade) the world on the whole and the way people behave in it with their selfish needs, (\\"I'm So Stupid,\\" a full-out rock charged angry anthem) family issues, (the beautiful \\"Intervention,\\" in which the 44-year-old mother of two sings of her enduring love for her 2 year old son) and the ability to love another with nothing but honesty and truth (\\"X-Static Process,\\" a simple, folk-inspired acoustic ballad).<br /><br />American Life on the whole is an album very much before its time, with doses of techno, dance, pop, rock, folk, and even country. Despite this excellent new blend of music, Madonna still remembers the all out dancefloor fillers. \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" is perhaps her most hardcore trance/techno song of her career, or at least since Ray Of Light's \\"Skin.\\" The highly weird and unique \\"Mother And Father\\" offers yet more insight into the feelings and troubles behind the death of Madonna's mother when the superstar was just five years old. She sings in a child-like nursery vocal tone that makes it seem as if she's singing the song but a few months after the incident, but we are then brought back to the present with another excellent rap. The addition of the James Bond movie theme \\"Die Another Day\\" also works a treat, and doesn't sound out of place on this album considering its theme. This all leads to an amazing finale to the album, the stunning \\"Easy Ride,\\" in which Madonna sums up life on the whole, wailing, \\"I go round and round just like a circle, I can see a clearer picture. When I touch the ground I come full circle, and I am home.\\" The string arrangement is fantastic and the futuristic techno beats enhance further more the reputation Madonna has at mastering brilliant dance hits.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Madonna has produced an amazing record here that ranks amongst the best she has ever produced. The people who have criticised this album have to open their eyes and take in what Madonna is saying, and not just dismiss it as an excuse for Madonna to play the sympathy vote. With American Life, Madonna has yet again left us intrigued and anticipating her next release. Wherever she takes it, we'll be there with her - proving that the music does indeed make the people come together...yeah.ngement is fantastic and the futuristic techno beats enhance further more the reputation Madonna has at mastering brilliant dance hits.

B000089RV6|5.0|At this point, I really don't need to tell you the story behind \\"Back in Black.\\"  You already know that it's the first AC/DC album since founding member Bon Scott's death and the first featuring replacing singer Brian Johnson.  You already know that it's one of the biggest-selling albums around the world.  And you already know that it's the Aussie-based group's best album to date. What you may NOT know is that the repackaged and remastered edition is a must-have, even if you already own prior versions on LP, cassette, or CD.  Re-released around the time the band received Rock and Roll Hall of Fame status, \\"Back in Black\\" appears in a Digipak cover with cool photos of the band, as well as a nice booklet with more pictures and a well written commentary by Rolling Stone veteran editor David Fricke.  And the sound quality?  I personally listened to the previous CD edition and this version back to back, and not only can you hear the difference but also FEEL the difference.  The new version projects with more force and clarity.  The previous CD was okay as it was, but Sony really took it to a whole new level.  You'll get to hear tracks like \\"Hells Bells,\\" \\"Back in Back\\" and \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" like you never heard them before.  So this review should end any speculation as to whether you should buy \\"Back in Black\\" again.  You can never own too many copies of an album like this, and Sony gave it the upgrade it richly deserves.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This was a fantastic movie and has held a place as my favorite vampire movie since it came out in 1994.  The casting is excellent and the atmosphere set by the lighting and sets make this a truly chilling story.  Fans of Anne Rice will note differances from the novel (eg. the return of Lestat) however these differances are shaddowed by the fact that most of the movie is a very accurate portrail of the novel.  If you are looking for a movie that will capture your interest from the very begining and keep it right to the end, I highly recomend this one.

0962477060|5.0|I am writing this because the reviews listed for the book are the reason I decided to buy it, and I feel obligated to help other guitarists.  The reviews about this book are correct--this is a great instructional text.  This book will change the way you look at the guitar and the way you play it.  I have been playing for 10 years and was fortunate enough to have a few great teachers in the past that all hinted on what this book explains in plain text.  The ONLY weakness of the this book, and only a serious guitarist would call this a weakness, is the fact that there is little discussion about learning the notes on the entire fretboard--which I think is very important in order to completely know and understand the fretboard.  If you used this book as a learning tool and worked through it completely, then learned all the notes on the fretboard and how they related to keys, scales, modes, etc. you would be a great guitarist and understand why this book is so good.  If you are a beginner, work through this book with an teacher, and if your teacher doesn't think it is a great book, find another one (teacher, that is).  If an you are an intermediate player, you can probably work through it by yourself.  If you are an advanced player, you will easily be able to work through it on your own.  Great book and I feel fortunate that Mr. Edwards took the time to write it.

B00005JLRT|4.0|I'm not really a fan of Star Trek TNG but I have some episodes that are very good and TNG movies are very good too since I'm mostly a fan of Star Trek's original series and first 6 movies but Star Trek Nemesis was pretty good despite a few disapointments which were no explanation how the Romulan's got Picard's DNA to clone him, Shinzon's purpose to destroy humanity, no Ambassador Spock in a few scenes since he is on Romulas trying to reunite the Vulcans and Romulans, where Sela is or what happened to her after Data Vulcan neck pinched her into unconciousness 12 years ago, and lastly Shinzon is in no way like Khan he was more like General Chang. Tom Hardy was good as Shinzon though and the space battle was done very well as well B-4 Data's retarded brother played so well by Brent Spiner. If you have seen Black Hawk Down Tom Hardy played Specialist Lance Twombly the soldier who got caught mocking the commanding officer. Data's sacrifice was nearly as good as Spock's was in Star Trek 2 and he was alot like Spock. Will I buy this movie? Yes I will so I can add it to the rest of my Star Trek videos and DVD movies. Star Trek quotes for the day regarding Data's death \\"Of my friend I can say this. Of all the souls I have encountered in my travels his was the most human.\\" and \\"The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one.\\"
0385504209|5.0|While I agree with some of the other reviews of this book in that the romantic story and forced suspense are mediocre at best, the resonnating fascination for me is the factual undercurrent that binds it all together.  This book speaks volumes to anyone who has ever questioned organized religion, and does more justice for DaVinci's genius than most art books I've read.  The truths Dan Brown shares in this book will leave you astonished, and good story or not, the possibilities he offers up about the Holy Grail are not soon to leave your conscious!

B000002UC5|5.0|This album is utterly mysterious, and must have seemed even more so when Paul put it out on the heels of &quot;Let it Be&quot; and the Beatles' breakup.  &quot;He left the Beatles to do THIS?? To make this slapdash little homebaked recording of love songs to his wife??&quot;<br />But with time, the value and importance of Paul's first solo effort has grown.  Domestic life, love of spouse and family turned out, indeed, to be Paul' great theme of the 1970s and early 80s. He showed no particular interest in this theme in the 60s, but then, his life had changed with his marriage, and just as John wrote about his new life with Yoko, his political engagement and his psychological therapy, and just as George explored his relationship to God and his disdain for the material world, Paul did this.  Who's to say that such a theme is any less worthy? As a path to personal fulfillment, Paul's idea is certainly one that has withstood the test of time.<br />With the passing of Paul's PR problems in the early 70s, it is easier to see the musical value of his solo work.  This album is actually really good.  It is musically of a piece with his work on Abbey Road and part of the White Album--irresistable melodies, somewhat fragmented construction, intriguingly off-kilter arrangements with a characteristicly solid bottom produced by his brilliant bass playing.  &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; was seen as a classic even back then, and holds up as a very fresh song now.  &quot;Every Night,&quot; &quot;Man We Was Lonely,&quot; &quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;That Would be Something&quot; are all fine songs, if perhaps a little unfinished.  Some of the instrumentals, especially &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; are quite enjoyable too.<br />This is a very &quot;sticky&quot; album, meaning the tunes stay in your head, and repeated listenings remain fresh. Slapdash it may be, or seem to be anyway, but Paul during this period was working with a kind of effortless genius, and the genius is most evident on this.  I think in many ways I prefer the offhand feeling of &quot;McCartney&quot; and its equally strange followup, &quot;Ram&quot; to the more professionally produced albums he did subsequently.nt on this.

B00005NTNU|4.0|I would buy the DVD set if it wasn't widescreen. I for one don't like widescreen because of the black spaces at the bottom & top. If the disk has standard on one side & widescreen on the other I would buy it.

B000083E79|5.0|It's rare to find a compilation album that includes all your favorite hits by an artist as accomplished as Cher.  For five decades, Cher has risen and fallen and risen again, hitting the music charts and grabbing our attention with her interesting roller coaster career.  Now, with the release of &quot;The Very Best of Cher&quot;, we, the fans, are rewarded with a great cd that gives us the perfect taste of her spell binding career.  From her early hits with Sonny Bono (&quot;I Got You Babe&quot; and &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot;) to the beginning of her solo career (&quot;Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves&quot; and &quot;Half-Breed&quot;) to disco (&quot;Take Me Home&quot;) to the 80s hits (&quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;) to the biggest hit of her career, &quot;Believe&quot;, this collection of best singles hits the mark.  This is one cd you can pop in the player and sit back and enjoy, without hitting the skip button.  I doubt this will be the definitive Cher collection because, as we all know, Cher is full of surprises.  I'm sure there are lots of hit singles to come.  But until she decides to retire from the spot light, we have this 21 track gem to enjoy.  The beat,really does, go on!
B000002L68|5.0|I'm not going to say much.  Everbody knows that Purple Rain is one of Prince's best all-time albums along with 1999, Sign'O'the Times.  To my opinion, there are no filler tracks.  I can jam to the whole album from Let's Go Crazy to Purple Rain.  I recommended classic
B000001EGA|5.0|Two words can sum up the quality of this album- PURE POETRY. <br />This mid-70's effort shows how phenomenal a songwriting team Elton John and Bernie Taupin really are (makes you wonder why Elton got it  into his head to put the partnership on hold during the late 70's and early 80's). Whenever I listen to this album, I always find myself amazed at the poetry Bernie came up with when he and Elton were working on this. I can't think of one track on the album when some aspect of the lyrics wasn't poetic. Elton also does a great job of interpreting Bernie's lyrics. <br />The title track could easily be the beginning of a story. When Elton sings it, he sounds as if he's reading from the first few pages of a book. The imagery is great too ('For there's weak-winged young sparrows that starve in the winter, broken young children on the wheels of the winners...').  &quot;Tower Of Babel&quot; could  be part of a collection of written poetry. It would be great even if it weren't set to music. I still haven't figured out what it's about, but I love it! The only way to describe &quot;We All Fall In Love Sometimes&quot; is gorgeous. This song is superb, poetically, musically, and vocally.  &quot;Curtains&quot;, the last track, is, in my opinion, the must poetic song on here. The imagery is fantastic. Elton's vocals and the instrumentation add a very mystical, almost psychedelic quality to it. It's definitely an excellent way to close an album. <br />The tracks that make up the middle of the album (&quot;Bitter Fingers&quot;, &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot;, &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot;), like the title track, are songs in which Bernie's lyrics and Elton's ability to interpret them really come together well. In &quot;Bitter Fingers,&quot; Elton's vocals really convey the frustration that I  imagine all musicians (and artists in general) feel during the early years of their careers. The feeling Elton puts into singing &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight&quot; is marvelous. You really get a feeling of desperation from him (much of which, I think, was because this song hit very close to home, being that he did actually try to commit suicide once). Elton's interpretations of &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot; and &quot;Gotta Get a Meal Ticket&quot; are also great .These also  happen to be two of my favorite tracks on the album. I really like  the bluesy, jazzy feeling of &quot;Tell Me When The Whistle Blows&quot;, and &quot;Gotta Get A Meal Ticket&quot; is a great rocker. &quot;Writing&quot; is the other track on this album that I absolutely love. You get the impression that both Bernie (in his lyrics) and Elton (in his interpretation) really enjoy working together.<br />I would definitely call this one of Elton's best albums . It would certainly go high up on my top 10 list (possibly even above Rock of The Westies, even though I love that album, too). If you haven't heard it yet, I seriously recommend it!
B000002N1E|5.0|I don't understand some people's expectations.  I think this album didn't get the credit it deserved.  I know anti-Prince people, who sing P. Control.  That was a hit in the clubs.  Then who could forget Shhh, The Most Beautiful Girl in the World, Shy, I Hate U, Billy Jack B, Gold.  This CD is awesome.  I would recommend it to anybody.
B00007E8V4|1.0|Please do not buy this, thanks.
B00005JLRT|4.0|The epic tale of the Enterprise is shown just like a piece of the great jigzaw who really is.<BR>            Something was missed in this movie, it have not the poetry of insurrection and the symbolic story of generations and maybe the best of all remains in the deleted scenes.               <BR>          Maybe is cos Jonathan Frakes and David Carson did a great work with the other movies, everyone have a natural talent to show the deep side of every character in a few scenes, but Stuart Baird seems not know well the Star trek universe losing the chance to do better scenes specially the end of the movie(the story was good but has not the emotion of every star trek movie, seems something mechanical and predictable for other type of movie)<BR>          Jerry Goldsmith make a fine work but very very under his quality level, specially after reinvent his own theme more than two times making in every film something far better from its predecessor.
079284131X|5.0|In the south side of Chicago, a detective, Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon),  chases a serial killer, Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif), dubbed \\"The Lakeshore Strangler\\". Ray's accomplice, Eddie Caputo, ditches him to save his own hide. Ray and Norris shoot it out in a toy store. Ray is injuried and threatends to get revenge. He then transfers his soul into a popular toy, A Good Guy.<BR>  Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent)is celebrating his sixth birthday and his widowed mother, Karen (Catherine Hicks), is saddend at the fact she couldn't get him a Good Guy for his birthday. <BR>  Karen and her best friend, Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff)find a Good Guy doll in the alley in the back of the depatment store. <BR>  Karen brings the doll back home to her son. Maggie has to baby-sit Andy that night and immeadiatley, strange things begin to happen. Television sets turn on, strange noises, etc. Maggie is then struck with a Good Guy hammer in the eye and is forced out of the window. <BR> Director Tom Holland (Fright Night) made a masterpiece of a film with this. It looks so real for it's time without all that corny clay-mation stuff of the 80's. Y'all know what I'm talking about. This is a truely compelling and scurry movie. I saw this movie when I was nine and it scurred me. The acting is terrific and well done. The movie becomes even more terrifying when Chucky wants to transfer his soul into young Andy's body. Holland did a very well job with a thriller about an innocent looking doll harboring the soul of a killer who wasn't ready to die.<BR>  The music is also great. The ending credits score was the best and mesmirizing music of the 'Child's Play' series.<BR>  The ending was great, too. With the door closing on the broken, burned remninents of Chucky.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Since the movie Deep Rising I have not seen a movie with not only the opening scene but also the intensity of the<BR>Alfred Hitchkock genere of twists. this movie is pure adrenaline edge on your seat  fear. Just when you think you have figured it out, it comes back again and again to put a end to that, it's not until the last when all hope is lost that you get to smile amongs't your feel good about the movie and still try to calm yourself down afterwards and say but it's only a movie. It is a movie that stay's with you.  A surprising movie of the year.
0156027321|5.0|Martel brings Pi to life in an imaginative and intimate way.  He writes about contemporary issues in an organic and fascinating style.   His insights into our sharing the world with other creatures, and the universal core concepts of world religions are presented intellectually and then demonstrated through storytelling.  I am a teacher who has relied on the tradition of Jesus teaching through parables to create interest in my best students--telling in a way that they draw their own conclusions.  The lack of closure keeps this story in the foreground of the mind long after the last page is read.  Martel links Parts 1 and 2 together in Chapter 74.  When he acknowledges that all his religious rituals have given him comfort, and yet it is so hard to stay open, to let go, to trust deeply, and to freely love, I felt he was speaking to the reader about what was required to &quot;get&quot; this novel. <br />His sense of humor saves the book from being tedious and self-righteous.  It's a gem!
B00005YW4H|5.0|What a pleasure to hear a performer who does not have to rely on in your face over-produced engineered sound quality, sub woofed to death, reverbed, digitaly delayed, and every other audio effect to make someone sound good. This may not be everyones cup of tea, but what it is, is great.  Talented musicians fronting a soulful singer. You may not like Billy Holiday, but that doesn't mean that Billy Holiday wasn't the best at what she did. There is a time and a place for this music and I can't think of anyone who does it better then Nora Jones.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Since I am a God-fearing, God-loving Christian,I had my reservations about watching the Harry Potter movies.I heard they were dark and evil.I found them to be entertaining and the biggest fact that I came out with is that the movie is more about love and loyalty to friends that wickedness.There are dark sides to everything but this I feel teaches what is good in people. Thank you. Teri
B00000IMTG|5.0|This is a GREAT live album. The sound quality is excellent, Martin Birch is a producing genius. The playing is equally brilliant, and Blackmore tears it to pieces on the guitar. Dio's voice is powerful as usual, and blows me away.<br />This album came out after the self-titled \\"Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow\\" and \\"Rising,\\" and before \\"Long Live Rock 'N' Roll.\\" That being said, it is quite strange that there is only one song from the very album they were touring for! It is \\"Starstruck\\" from the Rising album, and they don't even play the whole song: they do a little bit of it in the middle of \\"Man on the Silver Mountain.\\" Instead of promoting their newest release, they included 4 songs from their debut, a cover of Deep Purple's \\"Mistreated,\\" and a song that would later appear on the Long Live Rock 'N' Roll album (\\"Kill the King\\").<br />Basically, for all the songs except for \\"Kill the King,\\" they jam on the songs for like 10+ minutes each. Need I say that this is awesome? I love listening to Blackmore play the guitar.<br />However, the best part of the album is at the end of \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" when Dio goes \\"You're all the maaan!!!\\" It's cool. If you are a fan of Rainbow, Dio or Ritchie Blackmore, you will not be disappointed. If you are not, then start with something else (Rainbow Rising, Black Sabbath's Heaven and Hell, and Deep Purple's Machine Head, respectively).
B00006L9ZT|4.0|The praise and criticism of the two DVD Ring cycles make for interesting reading, but I would recommend the Met recording for the majority of mainstream opera listeners, particularly those who have not previously seen a live production. The staging and set design conform reasonably to Wagner's original descriptions (and he was quite explicit about these details), and the vocal and acting performances are satisfactory. Matti Salminen's Hagen was a singular performance highlight for me. The Met orchestra plays splendidly throughout with tighter miking which allows details of quieter passages to be heard more easily. I found myself frequently adjusting the volume of the Bayreuth set as the dynamics varied; but that orchestra performs brilliantly as well, and Boulez does generally move things along more briskly than Levine. I honestly think that both readings are acceptable interpretations of the score's dynamics. Those who have seen \\"traditional\\" Rings may prefer the novelty of Chereau's Bayreuth sets; but for me, the industrial settings drain the mythological feel of the work in an annoyingly distracting way. The Bayreuth vocal and acting performances are superb, so I did come to tolerate it; but seeing Hagen and the vassals carrying spears while wearing coats and ties ultimately seems rather silly. One can hope that the best features of both sets will be combined for an \\"ultimate\\" 5-star DVD Ring in the future. For now, I think that most users will be quite satisfied owning the Met Ring.
B00000IMTH|5.0|6 of the songs on this album are brilliant. The other 2 are excellent as well, but not on the same level of brilliance as the others; these are \\"The Shed (Subtle)\\" and \\"Sensitive to Light.\\"<br />With that out of the way, this is an awesomely rockin' record. The title track, \\"Long Live Rock 'N' Roll,\\" is one of the best Rainbow songs ever, it is such an anthem. \\"Lady of the Lake\\" and \\"L.A. Connection\\" are slower rockers that are equally great. \\"The Gates of Babylon\\" is an Eastern-sounding epic song, kind of in the vein of \\"Stargazer\\" (from the Rainbow Rising album). \\"Rainbow Eyes\\" is much different from anything they have ever done; it is a slow ballad with baroque-type instrumentation and arrangement. It is over 7 minutes long, as well! But, of this album, the best song by far is \\"Kill the King.\\" I love this song with all of my heart. The main riff is probably Blackmore's best riff ever (it's up there with \\"Smoke on the Water\\" and \\"Stargazer\\"). Just listen to it and feel the power!! The live version on the On Stage album is good, too. This song has a lot of energy, it's hard not to like it.<br />For this album, Rainbow has a different bassist from the last one, but he's good too. Cozy Powell rocks just as hard as he did on Rising, and of course Blackmore and Dio are incredible, need I describe it? The production is great too, the sound is in your face. Play it loud!
B00008WG3U|5.0|NOFX manages to put out another amazing album, it still amazes me how about thats been around for as long as they have can still put out fresh sounding albums with amazing songs, war on errorism is definately up there with some of their best work, overall the album sounds more in the vein of pump up the valuum than something like punk in drublic or white trash, but personally i like it better than pump up...the album opens with one of the strongest nofx songs ever, the separation of church and skate, amazing background vocals from eric melvin...\\"the mell yell\\". next song is the irrationality of rationality, another amazing song, one of the biggest differences with this album and the other ones, is that there is a lot more serious songs on it, not just a bunch of joke songs, even though there are a few...she's nubs is one of my favorite nofx joke songs ever, think about the title, i dont think i need to say much more..they also started playing ska again on this album, with songs like anarchy camp and mattersville which was on the last fat wreck chords comp...the lyrics to mattersville are amazing, its a place where old punks go to spend their golden years...there is also a lot of name dropping on this album, everyone from fletcher of pennywise to davey havok of a.f.i., some other highlights of the album include, the idiots are taking over, american errorist, and 13 stitches, which in my opinion is one of the coolest songs they've ever done, fat mike just keeps becoming a better song writer with every album and a better musician, one song i can't overlook is franco un-american, i think this is one of their best songs ever, its not even a \\"punk\\" song, its more of a straightforward rock song, but the lyrics are so amazingly sarcastic and political its awesome, and the music is great...the album closes with one of the most serious songs they've ever recorded, whoops, i od'd...at first i thought it was going to be a joke song or have some element of humor to it, but it actually doesnt its a serious song, amazing but it is kind of depressing at times, but its a good way to end an amazing album...another bonus about the album is the enhanced portion of the cd, it contains the live video for the song Idiot Son of an A***ole from warped tour as well as the music video for Franco Un-American...all in all its a great package, definately worth the money, fat mike, eric melvin, el hefe, and eric ghint definately get a round of applause for this masterpiece.....
B00005JKPF|5.0|I wasn't the biggest fan of the first Xmen, and went to view the sequel under duress.  By the conclusion of the movie I was pleased I had been dragged to see it.<br />Xmen 2 is certainly better than its predecessor, in fact I would go as far as to say it is one of the best movies currently screening. (I'm unsure whether the difference in film budget between to two movies has anything to do with this?) <br />Xmen2 has an amazing start with a breathtaking Nightcrawler sequence. From here it jumps straight into a serious multi-plot, grip the seat, drama.<br />Throughout the movie many of the comic book characters emerge such as Artie, Siryn, Colossus (the Russian teenager who can turn into steel), Pyro, Iceman, Cyclops, Rogue, STorm, Nightcrawler (who stars in the best action sequence of the movie), Mystique, Dr Jean Grey, Prof Xavier, Magneto and Australia's own Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.<br />The story line revolves around Prof Xavier's School for the Gifted being invaded by \\"Stryker\\" and anti mutant radical who blames the professor for his own sons condition. Many of the students are taken prisoner, and others become fugitives (surprise! these include the Xmen). SO becomes the quest to free Prof Xavier and save the mutants from a human uprising.  This involves, not only the release of Magneto but also other interesting storylines. <br />Throughout the movie I was hooked.  There is not one moment where you can pull your eyes away from the screen, and no time for a toilet break, which you can often take in other \\"slower\\" action movies. The ending paves the way for a third instalment of the series, which I would definitely pay to see. GO SEE IT!
B00005JKN9|5.0|This was hands down the best picture of 2002, and so far 2003. Chicago was okay, but compared to this masterpiece in cinema it doesn't even come close. I happen to think Martin Scorcese released this movie at the wrong time. If he had waited,perhaps people would have been a little more accepting of what he was trying to explain, and not just think of it as a blood and guts movie. Though it had a lot of violence I believe it was his way of convincing you that this was a terrible time in American history, the time they don't teach you about in High School history classes. Scorcese completely got robbed by all of the members of the academy, simply because they are obviously shallow minded and not willing to realize that these things actually did happen and we should never forget them. Instead of chosing an actual best picture worthy movie they must have gotten blinded by the bright lights of Chicago. All of the actors that participated in this wonderful movie were incredible, especially Daniel Day-Lewis. How amazing was he? Though Adrian Brody did do a really good job, Daniel just blew me away. Hopefully someday people will understand what Scorsece was trying to tell use, unfortunately by that time, it might be to late.
B000084T18|4.0|but the underground stuff is better! Try 'Guess Who's Back'.
B00007E8O5|5.0|jerry does awsome work in any of his cd's past and present and with or without the aic guys. but in this cd he's done a great job and has shown great improvement and growth as an artist. and he rocks
B00005MAM2|5.0|The best anime i've seen so far. This movie was one of the first anime that i saw with subs, i was used to see anime that was dub and thought i try this film a shot with subs. I'll never regret it, as soon as i saw this movie i always woder what the original to other anime was. Great for a first Anime file or just a collector.
B00008S2VG|4.0|A much more mature Madonna emerges in her lastest CD: American Life. It is probably her most personal and non-comercial CD to date. It gets much better after a few listens but you do wish sometimes Madge would lighten up.<BR>      As much as I have enjoyed the first two singles(American Life and Hollywood), I also feel that Nothing Fails, Mother And Father,Intervention, and Love Profusion are the best tracks and are also single worthy. The only songs that are simply OK and that I usually skip are I'm So Stupid and Nobody Knows Me. <BR>      I would most definetly recommend this CD but I wish there were a few more lighter tracks in the vein of Don't tell me, Beautiful Stranger, etc.
B000002OMN|5.0|I'm 15 now, and when i was about 6 my dad used to play this album on tape in the car a lot. Although i couldn't really grasp what any of it was about (not that it's especially complex), I've always loved it. Sure, it's pretty corny and ok, it's sung by an ex-fat guy, but every song on this album is fantastic. Years later, after my dad passed away and you and now download music via the internet, this album is still as significant to me as it was nearly 10 years ago.
6304711905|5.0|I've read the other glowing reviews for this film and I have to agree. This is one DVD I watch over and over again. There were so many great actors in this one, and not just the A-listed ones. Everytime I watch this film I wonder how come Val Kilmer never won an award or was even nominated for his portrayal of Doc Holiday in this film. I truly enjoy a good western and I put this one right up there with &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; and &quot;High Plains Drifter&quot;.
B00007ELF2|5.0|Wow. I wasn't expecting much going in...and to say that I was shocked by how good, gritty and altogether REAL this movie was is an understatement. I was absoulutely FLOORED by this film. There is not one bad performance in the entire movie. Not one. Everything in this movie, every word, every action, every shot makes sense. And while there are three stories (one of which is told from two perspectives) in this film, all three flow together masterfully to make for one large, honest, gritty, and sometimes disturbing film. This is probably the most honest movie about the drug problem in america that I have ever seen, and having family and friends that have had to deal with these exact demons, I appreciated this movie's honesty all the more. What really hammers the movie home however, is the resoulution of the plot and the ending (and final scene in the film to be exact). Simply one of the most powerful films I have seen in forever.<br />Don't watch this movie if you're expecting a simply entertaining film. This is a movie that will make you think, that will question your sense of right and wrong. But if you love movies that are thought provoking, well acted, and don't insult your intelligence and actually leave an impression upon you when the credits roll, you must see this movie.<br />My absoulutely highest recommendation.
B00005JKYI|1.0|Does anybody notice that this movie is about a town that outlaws dancing? I mean Christ on a Cracker, this script actually went through executives that said, &quot;Yeah, this movie is great, lets do this thing.&quot;  And how does a town that hasn't been able to dance for 6 years so good at dancing.  Go figure.  Also the song footloose is the 2nd gayest song in the world (The First is Jitterbug by WHAM&quot;).  If I could give no stars I would, but unfortunately I cannot.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Peppers is not the best Beatles album but it's close.  The first song you here is the title track which attempts to create the idea that what your listening to is a concept album and later reprise's itself to justify it.  <BR>The second song on the album is sung quite wonderfully by one of the most under-rated drummers of all time Ringo &quot;Billy Shears&quot; Star.  I had always heard this song on the opening of the Wonder Years and never had a clue that it was a Beatles Song.  I am a bass player and this song proved to me that Paul was eiter a God or God himself.<BR>Lucy in the Sky with diamonds is exactly what is... a stoned out trip of a song.  I mean just picture yourself on a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skys.<BR>Damn that Phillips commercial.  I had no idea that &quot;Getting Better&quot; was a Beatles song.  This song is possibly one of the catchiest songs on the album and one of my all-time personal favorite Beatles songs.<BR>Fixing a hole is a great song surrounded by even greater songs.  That's all I have to say.<BR>&quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; has some of the best harmonies I have ever heard.  <BR>For the benifit of Mr. Kite will there be a show tonight?  I don't really know.<BR>The first time I ever heard this song, I thought to myself, &quot;Hey, the bonus track on Tool's Opiate sounds a bit similiar to this.&quot;  The song being of course &quot;Within you, Without you&quot;  This song is amazing but for me it always throws off the album.<BR>When I'm sixty four is obviously all Paul, and that's why I like it so much.<BR>Lovely Rita is Okay.<BR>Good Morning is a little sloppy but it's still the Beatles so I'll forgive 'em.<BR>Sgt. Peppers reprise sounds like a modern remix with the hip-hop style drum sounds.  This song must have been the originator of all Hip Hop remixes and drumming because that's what it sounds like.<BR>There's only one word to describe &quot;A day in the life&quot; and that word is brilliant.  No othersong in the Beatles Catalog shows off John and Pauls writing style as indivuals as well as this song.  It's just brilliant.<BR>That thing at the end is supposed continue playing over and over again on the vinyl version.  So if you were all stoned listening to this on a record player that little bit of noise would play forever and drive you nuts.  That's just what I heard.
B000002UAI|4.0|Although the Beatles were obviously tired from touring and this album was made in a rush with many flaws and minor mistakes in both performance and production, it still contains some of their finest music from the time period.  Lennon's &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; is a classic example, which shows the Beatles love for American music.  The CD version is the Mono mix which helps hide some of the flaws more noticeable on the stereo mix.  It's quite possible that George Martin and his engineer were trying to &quot;fix it in the mix&quot;.  The Mono version is vastly superior to the stereo mix in that it has better balance of vocals and instruments.  I recommend this CD to anyone interested in the Beatles.
B00008S2VG|4.0|The \\"Material Girl\\" has grown up.  This is so different from all her other albums, though you can tell by her albums as she got older the music & style did change to reflect her maturity.  If you are a die hard Madonna fan you will probably enjoy this album.  If you just like her music every once in a while you could go either way (like it or hate it).  I am not a die hard fan though I have like her music over the years since she first bursted onto the music scene and I have to say that the music is awesome!  If you're a little liary then listen to a few of the sample tracks from Amazon and you can judge for yourself.  Some of the lyrics are rather bold and some are haunting but this is Madonna and she's always done her own thing which is why so many people like and enjoy her music.
B0000683DH|4.0|'Star Trek' is a cult phenomenon.  That statement alone would often drive away serious film buffs, but 'Star Trek II' transcends the archtype 'Saturday Matinee' film cliche.  The first 'Trek' movie was super-ambitious, and was on a studio release time table that caused some very important elements of the original release to be left on the cutting room floor.  Montalban is brilliant.  Nimoy is brilliant.  Shatner is (unusually for him) on-the-mark.  I cried the first two times I saw this movie.  The new edit restores some emotional relevance to the film as a whole.  Rent it.  Buy it.  Unless your heart is made of stone, you won't be disappointed.
B000067JD3|5.0|A highly melodramatic and involved story, coupled with flawless performances, makes \\"Traffic\\" one of the best films ever!  Benicio Del Toro may have won the Oscar but Catherine Zeta-Jones is memorable as the housewife forced to take over her drug lord husband's (Steven Bauer) empire.  Her transformation from the innocent and most pregnant spouse to \\"godmother\\" is stunning.  She may have won this year for \\"Chicago\\" but she deserved one for Soderberg's triumph.<br />The film's \\"look\\" is also one of its drawing cards.  Filmed in documentary-style, it makes the viewer feel as if he/she is watching an episode of a reality series, as well as a motion picture.
B00005JL78|2.0|This was a highly anticipated movie for me turned out to be very very dull and very very predictable. Very much along a typical Spielberg's recipy: great idea converted to be available for any type of customers, a perfect mediocricity. Nothing exciting. Not to mention this very grainy filming techique which makes it unpleasant to watch.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After hearing that Christine McVie opted out of this record, I had my reservations.  Her gorgeous voice, elegant piano playing, and memorable melodies have always been crucial elements to the band's sound.  If nothing else, her contributions provided respite from Lindsey Buckingham's more outlandish experiments and Stevie Nicks' occasional flightiness.  Luckily, though she is much missed, her absence is largely compensated here by the many superb songs and vocals.  <br />Make no mistake about it, this is not merely \\"Buckingham Nicks: Part Two.\\"  Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are the core of this band and they come through brilliantly with masterful playing.  Even when their two lead singers go off the rails, as they sometimes do, these veterans keep the material grounded and listenable.  For instance, Fleetwood's outstanding work on the otherwise overwrought \\"Come\\" is rewarding in and of itself.  Likewise, McVie's bass line on \\"Smile at You\\" saves the song from its pretentious and overbearing arrangement.<br />That said, Nicks and Buckingham deserve many accolades.  Coming off the success of her \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" CD, Stevie contributes some priceless material.  The title song is one of her most melodic songs since \\"Stand Back.\\"  Even if it is, ultimately, marred by the children's chorus at the end, the song offers one hook after another.  Even better is \\"Thrown Down,\\" a haunting and catchy tune that sticks with the listener long after the album has been put back on the shelf.  The lovely and sad \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is the perfect closer to the album and offers Nicks the ideal showcase for her uniquely world-weary voice.<br />Lindsey, too, comes through with some top-notch material.  \\"What's the World Coming To\\" is vintage Mac, bright and thrilling.  \\"Peacekeeper\\" is haunting and topical.  The already classic \\"Bleed to Lover Her,\\" while no match for its live version on \\"The Dance,\\" offers a splendid vocal line and ravishing chorus.<br />Of course, not all of the songs are perfect.  Though Nicks salvages both \\"Running Through the Garden\\" and \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" with awe-inspiring vocals, they are less-than-stellar cuts.  Too bad, too, that \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Destiny Rules,\\" while pleasant enough, sound like re-treads of previous songs.  When Stevie's on, she can't be beat.  When she's treading water, she's boring and bland.  (And what's up with the repetative lyrics on \\"Illume\\" and \\"Destiny Rules\\"?)<br />Unfortunately (and surprisingly,) Buckingham makes the biggest errors here.  \\"Murrow Turning Over in His Grave\\" is unlistenable, a squalling mess that makes the worst excesses of \\"Tusk\\" sound like classics.  \\"Miranda,\\" evidently about a porn star, suffers miserably from too-busy production.  Ditto the potentially wonderful \\"Say Goodbye,\\" a song in search of a solo acoustic version.<br />Indeed, \\"Say You Will's\\" greatest problem is Buckingham's production.  Sorry to say, but he hasn't had a new idea since his \\"Out of the Cradle\\" album.  If you've heard \\"Big Love,\\" you've pretty much heard \\"Everybody Finds Out.\\"  If \\"I'm So Afraid\\" grated on your nerves (as it did mine,) \\"Come\\" will drive you to absolute distraction.  Even when he's being \\"original,\\" he tends to be heavy-handed.  How much better would \\"Steal Your Heart Away,\\" a potential classic, be without the hyper-glossed sheen?<br />Whatever its faults, and they are significant, \\"Say You Will\\" stands as a welcome and rewarding CD from one of the greatest rock bands on the planet.  For all her spaciness and self-indulgence, Nicks is a riveting performer, one of rock's most vital singer-songwriters.  And whatever his flaws as a producer, Buckingham is ever-capable as a tunesmith and guitarist.  Even without the cherishable Christine McVie, the four members of this band make interesting and worthy music together.  Though they are not at their very best on \\"Say You Will,\\" they merit our attention and admiration.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I caught a snippet of Seven Nation Army while flipping throw radio stations while out of town and I had to have this. I love this band and I love this cd! If the bubble gummy junk and whitewashed rock of the video channels and radio has you ready to poke out your eardrums with q-tips then definately buy this ablum. The sound is a little punk, a little blues, with some folk and a lot of rhythm thrown in for good measure. It's fun to sing along to or just lean back in your seat and let the White Stripes take over.
B00008K7AM|5.0|I think this movie was the best ever. I will admit that it had a few gross gags but they were still hillarious.It really shows how hard it would be to switch lives with the opposite sex.I hope this was helpful because if you see it, I hope you like it as much as I did!  A+
B00005B4GU|3.0|It may seem odd that AMNESIAC was released only about half a year after KID A; I know it did to me. After listening to the album, it becomes apparent why this is: the band simply threw 11 more tracks from the KID A sessions (er, 10 more tracks and one \\"remix\\") onto a new record. The result is somewhat disappointing, especially coming from a band many claim to be the best in decades.<br />Let's start with the good points of the album. First and foremost, the singles \\"I Might Be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out\\" are both very good musically, and highlight of the album, \\"Pyramid Song,\\" is one of the band's best songs ever. The opener \\"Packt Like Sardines...\\" is an interesting electronic tune of about the same quality as \\"Everything in its Right Place.\\" Finally, \\"Dollars and Cents\\" is downright creepy at times, and is quite effective in continuing the general atmosphere of the record.<br />The negative aspects, however, are numerous. The big difference between KID A and AMNESIAC is that the band failed to arrange the latter well enough to make the record greater than the sum of its parts. On KID A, many of the tracks seemed too muted or abstract to enjoy on first listen, but somehow listening to the album all the way through took you on a mental journey, and everything flowed nicely. In other words, it bordered on being a freakish collection of electronic beats and mumbles, but somehow pulled itself together in the end. This is clearly not the case on AMNESIAC.<br />Another major problem is simply a lack of very good tracks other than the aforementioned singles. \\"Hunting Bears\\" is the definition of 'filler,' even moreso than anything Tool has ever put out. \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is an interesting but unnecessary remix of the KID A track, and I prefer the original any day. \\"Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors\\" resembles the song \\"Kid A\\" in some ways, and yet again, the latter was better executed and more listenable. The remaining tracks are, for the most part, uninteresting and forgettable.<br />Bottom line: unless you're a big Radiohead fan/collector, it is probably best that you spend your cash on HAIL TO THE THIEF (released June 10, 2003), which is a major improvement upon this album. AMNESIAC still doesn't dip into 1 or 2 star category; after all, it's still Radiohead, and there are at least four or five tracks here that outshine practically everything on rock radio nowadays. On the other hand, I have no reservations in saying this is my least favorite Radiohead record (not counting Pablo Honey, which I don't own). One thing is for sure: if you are new to Radiohead, this is absolutely NOT the place to start. If you enjoyed KID A and are starving for more, you very well may fall in love with AMNESIAC, but for a far superior blend of Radiohead's various talents and styles, I recommend that everyone pick up HAIL TO THE THIEF.<br />3.2 stars

0064430227|5.0|This is a story that my mother remembers reading when she was a child and I have read as a child and now my brother reads to his 7 month old son. So, for three generations, this book has made this family smile. This book is delightful and whimsical and the illustrations are so cute. This is a classic younger childrens book that I think will be read well into the next decade and beyond by millions of readers to their children because they remember reading it as a child themselves.
0812550706|4.0|I usually have trouble finding a good book to read, but as I read the first page of Ender's Game, I was already hooked. I think the author has a way of writing that you just want to hear more about the story. I like the futuristic plot because It's cool to learn the author's ideas about what life would be like in the future. One example I like is that your only allowed to have two children and the government chooses if you have a third. I give the book four stars because It's so easy to read and the plot about buggers (aliens) attacking the planet is just fasinating to read about. But it does go further, Ender's life at home and he being a third (third child of the family) is really emotional. The only reason I don't give the book five stars is because I thought it was a drag when we had to go back to earth and learn about Peter and Valentine (Ender's siblings) and what their up to. I wanted to keep learning about Ender and his journey at battle school, the earth life for Peter and Valentine was pretty boring, especially the fact of dedicating a whole chapter to them. But overall I loved the book and it's great for people who have book selection problems. I can say I'm really exited to read the next book of the series (Ender's Shadow) because Orson Scott Card is such a brilliant author.
B000089CKH|5.0|'Let Go' sheds Nada Surf's nerd-rock image and transforms them into truly talented songwriters. The album isn't without some flaws, Happy Kid, Blizzard of '77, and Fruit Fly all harken back to their 'Popular' days. Truly great ballads are intermixed with some great up-tempo songs. Also lost was a lot of their tongue-in-cheek humor that is great the first time but makes for a short shelf-life. It's been replaced by truly vulnerable lyrics about love, relationships, and life. Standout tracks include Blonde on Blonde, Inside of Love, Paper Boats, Neither Heaven nor Space, and my favorite: Killians Red. Buy this album now, it will not disappoint.
0316666343|4.0|Susie Salmon is your average beautiful 14-year-old girl.  In the beginning, we first find Susie in heaven, gazing down on earth after having been murdered. She is full of anxiety when she watches her distressed family go through the pain of not knowing where Susies body is or the killer.  After many months following Susies death, the world begins to go back to its regular conventional custom.  Soon Susie realizes heaven isnt all that it is said to have been and her time just consists of watching the living and roaming around her own made-up world.  I really liked this book, although the resolution took a while to come to being.  Alice Sebold uses absolute description on every scene and emotion you encounter.  You will really enjoy reading this book and the authors view on the nirvana that was given to Susie.
B00005JLF5|5.0|The one thing that is really remarkable about DS9, is that it gets better and better with each season. That's not to say that the earlier seasons aren't important or worth getting, in fact, just the opposite. To understand the complexity of the story that develops in the later seasons, one must know the story and motivations for the characters early on. I love this season, and think it is worth every cent. I think you will too. DS9 is not only the best Trek, but one of the best shows ever on television. :)

B000066NW0|4.0|Avril has several good songs, along with a great voice. Although, I think she has some identity issues... This isn't punk. It's more along the lines of pop-rock. Still, it's a great CD, and probably would appeal to teens, etc. Some of my favorites are \\"Losing Grip\\", \\"I'm With You\\", and \\"Unwanted\\".
0790731479|5.0|Ah, Tim Burton before he started taking himself too seriously. You have Michael Keaton unleashed, an unusally restrained Alec Baldwin and a supporting cast of known loonies all dancing to the puppetmaster Burton's tune.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I heard one of Norah Jones songs on the radio and HAD to know who's voice it was.  I was captivated, mesmerized and had to buy the CD.  I've played it numerous times and enjoy it even more with each time I hear it.  Slow, simple, yet provocative music.  It's very relaxing and puts a smile on my face.  It's amazing she's only 22 years old.  I'm very impressed.  I highly recommend this CD!  You'll love it!  Absolutely intoxicating!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This CD was worth all 7 grammys.  The words are poetic and sensual.  Her smokey voice soothes the soul after a stressful day.  This is the must have for those that love silky, smooth melodies with a lean towards a bluesy, Pasty Cline.
B000083E79|4.0|I enjoyed this cd a lot - I've loved Cher forever!! I wish she would do a duet with the sexy Michael Bubl -- I think they would look and sound fabulous together. Please Cher??
B000003S5H|4.0|This CD is a crafty mix of retro electronica treats. There is a LOT of mini-moog on here that gives it the throwback feel and it verges into some pretty serious French-ness at times but that doesn't take away from the overall effect. Clever, carefully produced music.
0385504209|5.0|I enjoyed this Book, immensly. I believed it to be well written, and fast pace. It is a notch above regulat fiction because it has a point. The book was well researched. The plot involves and ancient old secret society: the priory of sion, the conservatice catholic opus dei, fighting over the greatest cover-up in the history of the world. The Holy Grail, is not as believed jesus cup. The author is a christian, and at Dan Brown's website a bibliography is included. As to wether or not the disciple at the left hand of Jesus, in the painting of the last supper, is clearly a woman. Anyone who claims other ways really should take a look at it. Please do not dismiss this as Anti-Christian, but accept it as enlightnening and if true, an intriguing theory.
B00000DQSZ|5.0|Trans Europe Express may perhaps be considered a further exploration of the travel theme that Kraftwerk captured so brilliantly on their 1975 hit Autobahn. This album is more accessible than Radio Activity as it does not rely so much on atmospheric bleeps and crackles and the song structures are simpler. So you have the sweeping synth melodies, the forlorn vocals and the hypnotic rhythms taking the listener on a stunning musical journey through time and space. Europe Endless sets the rhythm of the trip with its trancey pace while The Hall Of Mirrors has a slower beat and vivid imagery while the title track picks up the movement of the journey again. Endless is a type of dub reprise of the opening track and concludes the album with a sense of hypnotic repetition. In my opinion Radio Activity is their crowning achievement, but Europe Endless deserves its five stars too.
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes is a wonderful book.   It will make you laugh, cry and want to give all of your money away to poor children all at the same time.   The book follows Frankie McCourt, a young Irish boy, through his many houses all of which are barely standing, through his many adventures through the streets of Limerick, through the deaths of his brothers and sisters, and through all the times waiting late at night for his father to come home drunk with no money from work and making the boys stand up and promise to die for Ireland.  Frankie is so poor that he has no shoes he's had the same clothes since he was about three years old.   Frankie struggles to survive in the tough streets of Limerick and earn money for his family.   He finally sails to America with hopes of a new life and prosperity.  This book is a masterpiece that will forever be an emotion-provoking novel.
0452282152|3.0|I found this book to be hard to get into at first, I'm not sure why. However, after, I felt the author really took us into the life of Griet, who goes to be a maid in the artist Vermeer's household, and what life was like in 1660s Holland. We see Griet grow from a wide-eyed innocent into a woman who learns who handle Vermeer's wife, his children (including one who is always out to get her), his mother-in-law, and the other maid in the house, along with attention from men! I found the descriptions of the paintings by Griet, someone who was not supposed to be used to viewing such fine pieces of art, to be extremely pleasing.
0688163173|1.0|This is easily Lehanes' weakest novel, and I've read them all. I'm not one who needs Angie and Patrick to return, so that's not my beef. I missed the maturity, character development, humor, hard hitting, well developed issues, plotting and incredible dialogue of Mystic River.<br />This book develops Teddy's character thoroughly, but no one else. The rest of the cast is cardboard.<br />The plot is implausible time and time again, the writing mundane and too concise. Particularly in the first half.<br />The social or interpersonal issues raised are not of the scope of Mystic or covered with any degree of similar depth.<br />I saw Lehane speak at a bookstore in California, and he was attentive, articulate, funny and very impressive. I hope the money hasn't affected his writing motivation, because it appears he churned this one out without much thought or depth.<br />Bring back the best mystery writer of this century, Dennis. Take your time and do it right, as you can.
B000024ASD|5.0|This is a synth fest set to driving and bubbling beats celebrating technology, computer games and power politics, executed with plenty of gusto and energy. Love Missile is thunderous and energetic with lots of echo, unexpected samples and galloping synths, while Atari Baby is slower and atmospheric, reminding me of Alan Vega's psychobilly excursions. Rockit Miss USA is catchy power pop, Massive Retaliation is a charming mix of beats and samples and Teenage Thunder sounds like Suicide at its most hypnotic and is full of quotes like \\"money makes the world go round.\\" She's My Man starts with a cheeky quote from the advertising copy for a certain hair gel. In its innovative use of synthesizer Flaunt It is on a par with Sparks' great masterpiece No. 1 In Heaven or Alan Vega's Collision Drive. Giorgo Moroder's talent was here applied to create a stirring, over-the-top post-modern rock statement. I still love it after all these years.

B00005QFE5|5.0|I saw this movie under the translated name of &quot;My father and mother&quot;, as the original Mandarin name &quot;Wo de fu qin mu qin&quot; would suggest. Which is an apt title, because theme wise, it veers around a young man harking back to the romance between a simple village girl (his mother) and the school teacher (his father). Lots of reminiscing, nostalgia, love, sacrifice. The End.<br />But it is this very simplicity that is stirring. Cinematographically on par with almost anything from Kurosawa, even &quot;Yume&quot;, this is an unembellished but heart-warming story of remembering a timeless love. No quixotic melodrama of Hollywood (a la Titanic) here, no elaborate somatic expressions of hugging/kissing/and all else. Indeed, Zhang Ziyi only needs a twitch of an eye or a shy gesture of the hands to convey an entire page of the script.<br />Doesn't matter whether the story is simple or complex, beautiful or ordinary, Chinese or otherwise -- I'd wager you will definitely come away feeling that you saw a charming, moving vignette of human essence. Fabulous!
B00008NG5V|4.0|I am a huge fan of Brushfire Fairytales, which I would catogorize as a must own, so I had high expectations.  Although I recommend On and On as well, it is not nearly as good as Jack Johnson's first album. It lacks the catchiness that immediately draws you into Brushfire, and instead requires numerous listenings before becoming memorable.  Taylor and Wasting Time are among my favorites.

B00005JLWN|5.0|I think Miramax Films really blew it when they did not market or promote this film as it diserved to be. Christian Bale does not outperform his role in American Psycho (like he ever will) but does carry the film well along with the rest of the casts performances. Kurt Wimmer's script is well written, directed and executed. I especially enjoyed watching it a third time with the Directors Commentary option. It provided me with an in depth look into Kurt Wimmer's thought process and passion while filming. I also enjoyed the fact that he doesn't take him self too seriously while he elaborates on his technical mistakes and &quot;how he would had filmed it if he had a larger budget and more time&quot;. A true &quot;lowbrow&quot; director. It is a MUST USED option for all film auteurs and wanna be film directors. I learned a lot from his input. He also inspired me to take up Japanese Sword Fighting. I was very impressed by the technical and historical accuracy that was put into the sword play. A MUST SEE.
0375414053|3.0|Having read the critical reviews which raved about this book, I must say I alternated between being amused by the witty style and good dialogue to thinking, \\"And how exactly is this supposed to be about an average working mom?\\"<br />Kate Reddy is a London-based hedge fund manager, married, two kids aged 6 & 1, with a nanny and an incompetent cleaning lady.  Her job requires her to jet all over the Western world at the drop of a hat, work late hours, miss all those important \\"mom times\\".  She spends most of the book whining about how she wants to spend more time with her husband and kids, meanwhile she is enjoying the power and status her job gives her.  Where I had a problem is feeling like she was a sympathetic character.  I, too, am a working mom.  I also work in a very male dominated field, where taking time for your kids if you are a woman means you are weak.  I have three kids to her two, one with special needs.  My husband is like most modern men, far less incompetent than those we see in sitcoms or read about in books like this one.  He can actually hold down the fort for weeks at a time if need be and does all sorts of things around the house, all the time, without being asked, and does them well(!).  No, he is not a saint.  He's just a partner, not an idiot.<br />I kept wanting to give Kate a swift kick in the [rear] and say, \\"Quit whining, you have NOTHING to feel sorry about!  What about the millions of us who cannot afford a nanny, have to drop the kids at school and day care, do the shopping, clean the house, cook, pick up after pets, take care of the garden, and somehow still find time to be a wife, and not just a working mom!\\"<br />If she's such a hot shot in the City, surely Kate could find something else to do that would allow her to put her kids to bed at night.  Get off the fast track if your kids mean so much to you.<br />And of course that's exactly what she does in the end.  She quits work.  Couldn't find a happy medium there, could you, Ms. Pearson?  Ah, but then in the end Kate is contemplating buying a company and  . . .<br />I am certain millions of us who work not just to afford the finer things in life but to be able to have a house in a decent school system, a car that is reliable, and be able to pay for the music lessons, ballet, martial arts, etc., kids want to do, would LOVE to be able to step off the treadmill and be there for the kids more than we're able.  Then there are those of us who enjoy what we do, want to do it, but are able to not be so obsessed with our work that we actually have time for our kids.  This book was hailed to be a must-read for every working mom.  Personally, it made me realize what a great job I have done of making sure the first things come first--and they aren't things found at my office.<br />If you're looking for a book that makes you want to slap the heroine, this is a great one.  If you want to read some amusing dialogue and good writing, this works for that, too (that's why I gave it three stars).  But if your working mom life is based in reality and you've already figured out that some things are more important than Success, you'll probably feel the same way I do right now--[cheated.]  I was told Kate was the heroine for working mothers.

B000060P79|5.0|This CD is probably the best CD you could ever spend your money on. Simple Plan is the best band ever and i cant wait for them to come out with a new cd. im gonna rate (1-10) every song for you so you can get an idea of the good and the bad songs.<BR>I'd Do Anything: 10! A very good and fast song with good pop/punk beats to it. <BR>The Worst Day Ever: definatly not my favorite but its still Ok id give it probably a 7.<BR>You Dont Mean Anything: This is a GREAT song. Joel Madden of GC sings in this song but you cannot really tell. still an awesome song i give it a 10.<BR>Im Just A Kid: I absolutly love this song its so awesome... definatly a 10.<BR>When Im With You: this one is hard. Its a pretty good song. i would probably give it an 8.<BR>Meet You There: Its A great slower song but I dont listen to it often. i would give it a 6.<BR>Addicted: This definatly is their best song. I love it! it definatly gets a 10!<BR>My Alien: This song is such a joke and i dont know why they put it on the cd. I cannot stand it. It does have a good beat and all but Pierre's voice sounds funny and the lyrics are stupid. 2.<BR>God Must Hate Me: this song is pretty funny and kinda weird but i like it. i would give it an 8.<BR>I Wont Be There: i like this song but it can get sorta annoying. i would give it a 7.<BR>One Day: this song is pretty cool and i like it so i give it a 7<BR>Perfect: this is a great, cute slow song and pierre's voice is amazing.

B00005JLKN|4.0|In the opinion of this reviewer, public fascination with the flesh eating psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter, should cease after \\"Red Dragon\\".  After the truly gross-out brain scene in \\"Hannibal\\", we get a more subdued interpretation of both the man, played by Anthony Hopkins, and the subject matter.  But the lack of gore isn't replaced by the hyper-paranoid sense of tension in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\".  PLOT WISE: An ultra bland government agent (portrayed by the ultra-bland Edward Norton) is called back into service after a series of slice and dice family homicides leave the FBI baffled - as if!  There is a sense, even from Hopkins, that he's played this role one too many times.  <BR>The transfer is pretty much first rate.  Colors are rich, warm and well balanced.  Flesh tones infrequently adopt an orange hue but nothing that is extremely out of character.  Contrast and black levels are accurate.  Fine detail occasionally gets lost in the darkest scenes.  Film and digital grain are both present but not at levels that would distract.  Edge enhancement crops up now and then.  Shimmering of fine details and pixelization are present but at a minimum.  The 5.1 audio is nicely balanced with deep bass and natural sounding dialogue.<BR>Extras: A documentary that is pretty much average, some outtakes, audio commentaries and behind the scenes junkets that don't enhance or detract from the over all presentation.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: The movie is nothing to write home about.  The transfer is considerably better.  But don't you wish, just once, that a truly worthy movie, like say \\"Gone With The Wind\\" would get an ultra amazing digital treatment on DVD.  Ah, now that would be real coup!
B000001FCB|5.0|There are 3 master albums of Bossa Nova vocals: the Sinatra/Jobim album on Warner sung in English, this Elis Regina/Tom Jobim album sung in Portuguese and &quot;Amoroso&quot;, the Joao Gilberto/Claus Ogerman collaboration, sung in Portuguese, English, Italian, Spanish! Don't miss the chance to have all three. Elis Regina is here in a 1974 album she had the opportunity to record as a celebration of her 10-year career at Polygram Records/Brazil. The gift was a collaboration with Antonio Carlos Jobim, composer of all repertoire. The album consists of 2 different ensembles: one set by Jobim's traditional environment with strings and another set with her then-current quartet, having her then-husband as a leader, Mr. Cesar Camargo Mariano. All stars! Important Note: Bossa Nova is not necessarily Jazz. Bossa Nova is not even Latin music. Bossa Nova is ... Bossa Nova. Listen to it!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown explains how the Catholic church sent women to their death during the middle ages, calling them witches.  For too long the Catholic church has hidden its past amid claims of saving souls from some hateful god who would burn them in hell if they don't do as this church says. Hopefully this well written best seller will expose readers to the past and present sins of this massive cult. Brown's work makes fascinating reading in the context of this cults attempt to cover up the very real sins of its leaders against thousands of children.<br />According to Brown Catholics, for centuries, have attempted to cover up many original unpleasant truth's about the founding of this religion. That the cover ups never stop should give anyone pause.<br />Brown's book is not all that great as a thriller - but the subject matter is fun and fascinating and perhaps will hasten the demise of an ancient anachronism.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I don't know what to say about this album that hasn't already been said... but I'll just go on and say that if you find yourself not 'getting' the album after a listen or two, you really have to sit down and give it time and it just gets so much better as time goes on.  It's been almost 6 years since its release and I still find it very exciting and enjoyable listening to this album today, and I've listened to it ALOT! Every little sound and note made on this 53 minute masterpiece is just beautiful.  The whole thing (including Fitter Happier) flows together like a beautiful story, it achieves what very few albums in history have ever achieved.  Best album of the 90's, IMHO, probably best album ever.
B00008MNYS|5.0|Hey Kevin Gatley and all those in the US who didn't get it - Geoff Hurst (now Sir Geoff Hirst) did indeed score. Three times in fact in the 1966 World Cup Final, English football's finest hour and a half.
B00005B4GU|2.0|Let me start off by saying that I love Radiohead.  The Bends, OK Computer and Kid A are three of my favourite albums of all time.  I don't know what they were thinking when they released this album.  Their three previous albums were all FLAWLESS in my opinion, but more than half of the songs on this album could of easily been left off.  It starts off with \\"Packt Sardines...\\" what a boring and half-assed song... Radiohead usually start their albums off with a BANG, but not this time.  The highlights of the album are: \\"Pyramid Song\\", \\"I Might Be Wrong\\", \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"You And Whose Army\\".  I have no idea why they included weak version of \\"Morning Bell\\" on here, nor do I see why \\"Hunting Bears\\" probably the worst of all Radiohead 'songs' ever is on here.  If this was a 5 or 6 song EP rather than a full album it would made a lot more sense.  Especially since they included all these filler tracks, yet they have great unreleased songs which for whatever reason they decided not to include on this, of course I'm talking about studio versions of \\"Nude\\", \\"True Love Waits\\", \\"Lift\\" etc. which are terrific songs.
B00005JLF5|3.0|This is a fairly good series but the Bonus disk COMPLETELY RUINS any hope of watching the series and enjoying the plot twists and what there is of a story arc.  <br />Back in 1997 I had to stop watching the original airings, and I had hoped to be able to pick it up now and enjoy it as a new experience.  Unfortunately, I loaded the Season 1 Bonus Disk after watching the Season 1 episodes, and I must have seen 10 spoilers in the space of three minutes, thanks to a rapid-fire series of one-second shots that very efficiently showed all the major developments of each season. ON THE SEASON 1 BONUS DISK. These were major, major spoilers -- everything you are probably thinking about right now if you know the series. Very frustrating for me, and quite the shocker for my wife who had not seen the series before.<br />Not only frustrating and shocking, the experience was rather irritating because it suggests an attitude on the part of the producers of \\"Well of course everybody has seen our series.  Everybody watches Star Trek, right?\\"  No, not necessarily.  Frankly speaking, I was watching Babylon 5 at the time and I decided that trying to watch DS9 at the same time was like trying to drink a synth-ale after downing a couple of Guinesses.  So now we find the question \\"Why should we buy the rest of it if there will be no surprises\\" creeping into our minds.<br />My advice if you are watching for the first time: Enjoy the episodes, leave the \\"Bonus Disk\\" resting peacefully in the box.  After they release the entire series, you can decide whether or not you want to go back and watch seven Bonus Disks back-to-back.  It was a brain-dead and avoidable mistake to spoil the viewing experience in this way.  My rating:  This might have received 4 or 5 stars based on the quality of the episodes, but the spoilers ruin all that and make this a 3.
0385504209|5.0|This is an excellent book to bring awareness to the secrets discovered in the late XIX century, about the lineage of Jesus in Europe, by a priest in the small French village, Rennes le Chateaux. This small town is located in the heart of the Cathar region.<br />For those who have read the &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot;, the interesting fact is that the priest's name was ...... Sauniere !!<br />For those who know about Rennes le Chateaux, Sauniere happens to be a key person in the Da Vinci Code novel.<br />The &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; has many more codes. Enjoy the reading and the discovery of the secrects.
0375703764|5.0|Simply put, House of Leaves is a teriffic book.  However, it is not for everyone.  The book is extremly long, and at some points it does seem to drag on without a point.  But, that is exactly the point.  THERE IS NO POINT.  It is up to the reader to figure out and decide what really happened.  (If anyone has ever played the Silent Hill games, you could easilly compare the strange, bizarre-ness of this book to them.)  <BR>Danielewski has created a completly crazy and unbelievable world, where nothing is as it seems...when you can make sense of it's insanity.  When and if you read this book, you must keep in mind that it doesn't make sense and it will either make you go crazy, or you will just fall in love with it.  The book is as twisted as the labyrinth inside Will Navidson's house.<BR>The book consumed a good 2 days of my life, and then many more afterwards as I tried to uncover just what it was all about.  Keep an open mind.
B0000931QA|5.0|It's funny to think that circa early 1989 at age 14 I stood in a department store with just enough money to buy one cassette.  I often bought cassettes without ever having heard any of the music on them...I'd just buy something whose cover caught my eye.  I had a surprisingly good success rate this way, but I digress.  On that particular day I had my choices narrowed down to either this one or Milli Vanilli's &quot;Girl You Know It's True&quot;.  <BR>I ended up getting this one and the rest (and MV) is history.  Weaned on the likes of Def Leppard's &quot;Hysteria&quot; the previous year this was hardly the bubble gum that I was expecting and I was put off by it, but still intrigued by its ambition.  I may have sold off the cassette before this album really grabbed me, but now with an adult understanding of the lyrics I like it more than ever.  The remastered version further deepens my appreciation of it by including a stellar 16-page booklet explaining Geoff Tate's original inspiration for the album's storyline.  The plot is gripping, and neither the storyline nor the songs come off the least bit contrived.  As one reviewer said, turn off the lights and it's like it's all real.  The album recently ranked #2 in Classic Rock magazine's top 30 concept albums of all time.  It's nice to see it get the accolades it deserves.  &quot;Operation: Mindcrime&quot; rewards repeated listening for years and deserves a space in your collection.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I'm 48, I bought this vinle album in 76 (I think) It seems to me that it came out the same time as Abba's lst album. Which I also bought.   I've always bought a WIDE range of music from Barbara Striasend (sp) Elton John, Ten Ernie Ford, Gary Wright,<BR>Three Dog Night, Steppin Wolf (sp) and many more.  Today's teens<BR>in general it seems to me, as I drive on the street, do not know<BR>the meening of music.  I've tried to listen to rap. I couldn't understand the words--I read them--VULGAR--FILTHY.  Same 3to6 notes over and over again.  Who ever thinks this is music is fooling their selves and needs to broaden their horizions.  You can express you extream pain and torment in such a mannor and with more than 3-6 notes that makes a better understanding of where your soul came from and where you'd like it to go--unless<BR>you only like--VULGAR &amp; FILTTH.   After l wk of being forced to listen to EWF or some other happy artist certainly they wouldn't<BR>be any worse off than those who are locked up in jail or listening to the present torrment that they've been listening to.  It pains me to see one of my sons so ensnared in this so called (music???).
0920668372|5.0|This book has become one of my favorite books to read to all ages and gender since 1986. This story of a mother's love for her son through his growth process is delightful. It starts with a new mother rocking her new baby and singing him an enchanting song that will last in his mind forever. As he grows he seems to drive his mother crazy as he reaches each developmental stage. But when night falls and he is asleep she shares a loving moment with him by rocking and singing to him. I can never get to the end of the story without a crystal tear drop. This book is a great gift for mothers, fathers, daughters, and children. This is the number one book I give on birthdays and Mothers Day.
B000005H3M|5.0|I remember this album fondly.  My father bought the album for me in  the early 70's, and I recorded it on tape so I could listen (and appreciate it) more when driving.  <BR>Those familiar with &quot;commuter Jazz&quot; or the 60's sound, fast and driving will understand this.<BR>Listen to this in comparison with Harry Connick, Jr.'s sound, and you'll feel and hear the difference.  It is from a classic big bander changing with the times, like Miles Davis.  I enjoy this collection, and for drummers, you'll be impressed, and what stamina the man had!
B000001Y2U|3.0|Marilyn Manson second official relase was Antichrist Superstar their  most talked about, controversial and biggest selling LP to date. But is it really shocking. In my huble opinion it is not. The fact is that this could hardly be a metal album but it should fall into the genre of goth music. Manson worked with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails on this album and I am sorry to say he had to hire someone else to produce this material. The fact is that this album relies so much on sound effects and weirdness that it overlooks the music which is so little part of this album. Also the fact is that you can barely hear what MM is singing about and like other reviewer said that his voice sounds like a machine. <br />Also note that this album has 99 tracks on it 16 of those are actual songs and only handful of those tracks are worth listening to. The fact it is over 75 minutes long does not help either. <br />I give the album however credit to be orginial,strange,provocative and something different then other acts who fit into his genre are doing. The blocket is nice and the cover art is fabolous. The videos for this album were amizingly done and everything with it. However I feel that Album making is not Marilyn Manson strongest point and I feel that he should express himself in some other way because  80% people who buy his music either buy it because they think he is cool and his music rocks and those who don´t buy it sometimes think he´s disgusting and other think he is like a clown.I am sorry to say but I think Marilyn Manson should change his image to something esle because he is indeed becoming a clown and I feel a bit sorry for him.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers was one of the most moving films ever made.  The actors in the film truly make you believe that they were apart of the 506th Airborne Division Easy Company.  I also found that having actual survivors from Easy Company at the beginning of each segment made the film even more real.  I am a young man, but the respect that I have for the men that fought in WWII knows no bounds.  It is an amazing piece of history.

B00000BIBQ|5.0|S.F. SORROW seems to elicit extreme responses--many either love it or love to bash it.  I'm in the former category; in fact, I think it's the group's masterpiece and one of the many masterpieces from the psychedelic era.  After the two 1965 albums (albums that were a bit ahead of their time, I might add), Pretty Things released EMOTIONS (1967) in the UK and started working on S.F. SORROW the same year.  It's an enthralling work--yes, brilliant...there isn't a weak song to be found.  The whole is cohesive, and it's filled with bracing variety.<br />Pretty Things keep the chord progressions fairly simple and straightforward, which works well with the group's hard-edged sound.  The thoughtful and infectious melodies and harmonies, the highly tasteful and original rhythms, the band's mix of drive and finesse...all this works together most convincingly to thoroughly knock me out.  Even the endings are imaginative!  Horns and strings are used to give a classy psychedelic disposition to \\"S.F. Sorrow Is Born.\\"  An interesting, even bizarre mix of instruments embellishes \\"Bracelets Of Fingers.\\"  The middle instrumental breaks of that tune and \\"She Says Good Morning\\" pour on the cosmic splendor.  \\"Private Sorrow\\" is a favorite of mine, with its quirky little breaks and hypnotic march rhythms.  Each song is individualistic and has its own uniquely special qualities.<br />The Beatles and Pink Floyd influences are present, but are assimilated into the group's own sound and style.  Nothing here sounds pilfered, not even the very Beatles-like \\"Baron Saturday.\\"  (The bending strings on the chorus are just an ecstatic gas, and that fake-out ending gets me grinning from ear to ear every time!)<br />I see no need at all to compare this album with anything done by The Who.  I love The Who, and I love Pretty Things.  They are two different bands with two different sounds.<br />As far as this being the first rock opera goes, I'm still not convinced that a true rock opera exists.  (Grab a copy of Willi Apel's HARVARD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC, read the seven and a half pages for opera, then read the two pages on oratorio and make up your own mind.)  I think it's really stretching it to call this and TOMMY opera--too much is simply narration, for one thing.<br />The first rock concept album?  I think the first rock concept album was by Elvis.  In general, both Christmas and Gospel easily qualify as concepts, and the Elvis albums predate S.F. SORROW by several years.<br />Because of various circumstances, this product of 1967 was not released until late in 1968 (when psychedelia was very much on the decline).  That's no matter; anyone who loves the psychedelic 60s should thrill to this.  My advice is to forget all the hype on what this album was supposed to be, and just enjoy it for what it still is--a great album.<br />Cheers,<br />Murraycopy of Willi Apel's HARVARD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC, read the seven and a half pages for opera, then read the two pages on oratorio and make up your own mind.)

6305657947|5.0|Brilliant schemes, mind-boggling crimes, and outwitting thieves -- these all describe the latest craze in movies classified as \\"smart criminal\\" movies. The Thomas Crown Affair is by far one of the best emerging in the past decade.<BR> Based in Chicago, the movie focuses around Thomas Crown (Pierce Brossnan), a rich and well respected businessman, who in his free time, is seen around a popular art museum. When a hundred million dollar painting is stolen from the museum, nobody suspects it is Crown except for insurance agent Catherine Banning (Rene Russo). After Banning flatly tells Crown that he is a suspect, the viewer goes for a wild ride as Crown tries to persuade Banning that he didn't take it. Banning and a team of undercover officers storm Crown's house in an attempt to find the painting but come up empty. <BR>What happened to the painting? Did Crown take it after all? Sparks fly between the Banning and Crown and viewers see just how romantic and wealthy Crown is. The ending of the movie is a scene to be remembered. The Thomas Crown Affair is a must see if the viewer enjoys the \\"smart criminal\\" genre of movies. Its excellent plot and filmography makes it enjoyable for all PG-13 viewers.

Together, the book and the movie are the greatest source of legal entertainment around.

B00005JLWN|5.0|I was one of the lucky few who saw this in the theater and enjoyed every minute. One thing that becomes quite obvious early in the film, except to maybe the most dull of movie watchers, is that this film is not to be taken literally. The story unfolds as a parable where a fascist society controls the masses under the guise of society's best interest.<br />All of the performances carry the futuristic fairy tale through its motions in a fresh if not original narrative down to the final battle.<br />My only problems with this film are the people who are marketing it and the people who are watching it. The creators of the Matrix wisely recruited the veteran talent of Yuen Woo Ping for fights and stunts. I love his work in the dozen and a half movies I've seen that showcase his it. But NOTHING done in the Matrix with respect to fight choreography is new and has been done better by Jet Li and Donnie Yen. Equilibrium offers not only an original looking choreography but there is a reason to it aside from looking cool because you can. Neat fight scenes and a dark future are the only things this movie and The Matrix have in common so to all those professional and amateur movie reviewers alike, please stop illustrating your narrow knowledge of film by continuing to compare every dark future film to The Matrix, you might as well be comparing all these films to Johnny Pneumonic.<br />See this film, expect a fun parable and enjoy yourself. If you still don't get it, then give it another chance with the commentary on.
0380973650|4.0|Book Review<br /> Imagine yourself caught in a battle between the old gods of America and the new gods. See yourself being lectured by the god of the media in the form of Lucy Ball or the All-Father god in the form of a misleading friend. Which side would you rather be on. Which side is the right side, the benevolent side, and the side of the good? Shadow is in this situation in American Gods: A Novel after being released from prison and finding out that his wife is dead and that he has no job waiting for him his life is ruined and he feels that now it does not matter what he does with his life. So he goes to work for the first person to offer him a job, who called himself Mr. Wednesday. He was a god.<br /> In this story created by the brilliant mind of Neil Gaiman there is Wednesday and there is Shadow and there are many other people and gods heard of as the books progresses. Each of them are out for their own survival. In this new age world of the internet and television the old gods are weakening because less and less people are worshipping them. The gods thrive on being prayed to, on being sacrificed to, or on deeds done in their names. All the gods wanted to be believed in. And that is how the war started. Each god was up against others because there was not enough people in America for all of them to be remembered. Wednesday and Shadow were on a quest to get rid of the new gods so there was room enough for the old, or at least that is what Shadow, a human, thought they were doing.<br />Neil Gaiman created interesting characters with great personalities that gave the word god a new meaning. Take Media, the god of media, for instance. She made the story more interesting with the methods she used to talk to Shadow. She talked him twice on television as show characters. Once she was Lucy Ricardo from the show, I Love Lucy and another time she took on Carla and Dian from the show, Cheers. Each time I could not help laughing after visualizing these characters from TV shows that I have seen before saying the things she said. Another character named Laura also made the novel more pleasurable. Laura was Shadows deceased wife who had come back from the dead as something not far from being a zombie. She helped Shadow get out of trouble numerous times because it was pretty easy for her, being dead, to hurt or kill people that were in her way. With characters as cool as these it is there is no wonder why this book was so fun to read.<br /> This story is filled to the brim with exciting scenes and incidents. One incident occurred when Shadow died and went to the hall where they sorted out the dead. After being tested he was told he got to choose his fate. He could have gone to heaven or hell but he chose to be left alone in nothingness. This scene was a very good one because it left the reader thinking of what nothing is. This is a question that is very hard to answer. Another exciting incident occurs when Cernezobog plays Shadow in a game of checkers. Now for any reader who is interested in board games, checkers is not a very hard game to play. In the story Neil Gaiman made a checkers game into a battle that was much more challenging than chess, it was also made more intense when Shadow and Cernezobog made a bet. If Cernezobog won he would get one swing at Shadow's head with a sledge hammer and if Shadow won Cernezobog would have to come with Wednesday and Shadow to help them on their quest.<br /> I suggested that persons who enjoy books that make you think about the world around you, and individuals who question the after life, and folks who are just looking for a good book that they can sit down and enjoy reading, give American Gods: A Novel by Neil Gaiman a try. Enter Shadows world where gods are all around you and they are real. Read about American Gods.shows that I have seen before saying the things she said.

0385493622|5.0|Singh does a tremendous job of, in a very short book, describing what Fermat's last theorem was and how people went about proving it.  It is an outstanding story of suicides and lives saved, brilliance and persistence.  This is also good history, as in only a few pages one becomes literate in the evolution of mathematics from Greece to Alexandria to renaissance.<br />For the wannabe mathematician, this is an exciting book.  Though the actula mathematics involved in solving the problem are clearly beyond reach for almost everyone, it does not hamper a reader from understanding the basics, as the author offers many examples of how a proof is done and has appendix on a couple of relatively easy examples (such as the proof for Pithagoras' formula).  I highly recommend it as a quick read.  Personally, I am definitely going to read more about mathematics, a topic that previously seemed too dry.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Great continuation from the first movie! Lots of action and drama, the movie sucks you in! Can't wait for #3!
B00005QZWI|5.0|The music very accurately portrays the feel of what is going on at that time during the movie, but even better--it plays absolutely perfectly as a stand-alone, too.<br />When I heard that Howard Shore was to put music to my long awaited movie I was disturbed, being unfamiliar with his work.  But the director, Peter Jackson, chose well.  The &quot;Farewell to Lorien&quot; music, written by Mr. Shore, is among the most beautiful music I've ever heard in my life.<br />  I would definitely recommend this album, and its &quot;sequel&quot; music soundtrack for &quot;The Two Towers&quot; to any lover of beautiful, powerful, and evocative music.
0930289234|5.0|Watchmen is a stunning work of fiction which demonstrates what can be done in a graphic novel format.  The unity of writing and art is unmatched--everything from the recurring images of the clock face throughout the book to the unique chapter (in the center of the book) in which Rorschach, the character whose face is a symmetrical ink-blot, is (briefly) captured by the police--in that chapter, the first and last pages of the chapter are mirror images of each other in terms of layout, as are the second page and the next-to-last, and so on, until we reach the symmetrical double-page-spread in the center.  What's even more amazing is that Moore (if I understand the behind-the-scenes story correctly) originally intended to use pre-existing characters, including the Blue Beetle and others from the sixties, but was forced to create a new cast from scratch when licensing didn't work out.  As a student and teacher of literature, I can say that only a few comic books deserve the title NOVEL, but this one definitely does.  The plot winds a bit, but never unbearably so.  And like a great work of fiction, readers become attached to the characters by the end of the piece.  Anyone who likes writing that stimulates thinking would like Watchmen.
B000035Z3K|1.0|This is quite possibly the most overated film of all time.  It is not a good movie.  Keeping in mind the time in which it was made, it is still bad compared to other movies of the time.  The acting is bad, it doesn't even come close to following the book (but then again, what Dracula movie does?), and the camera work is extremely shoddy.  The only plus of this movie is that there is a pretty gloom and creepy atmosphere to it.  But the fact that this version is so highly touted and the Coppola's version, although far from perfect, is so bashed is a testament to how bad film critics are at thier job.  Very dissapointing movie.
0393057658|2.0|Having read all of the Bill James Baseball Abstracts since they were first widely published, as well as articles and books from others in the field of sabermatics; and having been a Met fan since their beginning in 1962 and remembering the playing career of Billy Beane, I looked forward to reading this book. What a disappointment.<br />After the first third of the book, which laid out the foundation of the Oakland A's methods of evaluating players, referencing the seminal works of Bill James and others regarding on-base perentages, pitches seen per plate appearance, et al, the remaining two-thirds turned into what I consider a PR puff piece on the greatness of Billy Beane, the man who saved or at least reinvented baseball. <br />Not only did I find the book rather ponderous from the midpoint on, but I also thought the descriptions of Beane's habits to be depressing and very sad. Without a doubt he has retooled scouting and player development using the methods of sabermatics, yet he doesn't want to watch, actually almost cannot watch, the games themselves. When he does watch, he cannot enjoy what he is watching. Somehow, author Lewis does not see it this way, or chooses to make light of it as simply a quirk.<br />With too little discussion of the technical nuances of his methods for my taste, the book is really a character study of a very complex and flawed individual, a man whose whole life revolves around baseball, but not the game as it unfolds on the field but instead the game of buying and selling commodities. It is almost as if he is only in the game to prove to others how smart he is, to gain revenge for the injustice of his playing career, and to do this by controlling and in some cases demeaning others (scouts, Art Howe, et al.) His front office staff come off far better, as men who love the analytical techniques they are bringing to the game, but also as men who love to watch the game unfold. In the long haul, it is they who seem to have the brightest and happiest futures, not Beane. <br />In summary, I was very disappointed in the book -- the exerpt in Sports Illustrated and an earlier article in the New York Times Magazine told me as much as I believe was necesary to understand the methods, and the study of the man was too much a glorification of Bily Beane and too little an objective look at  a very complicated man.
B000002UJQ|5.0|By the time this review is written, this CD has been around the block. Following it's release, OK Computer recieved every kind of award imaginable, Thom Yorke became an international figure, and Radiohead was immediatly launched as one of the greatest bands of all time.<br />And it's rare that the album that's receiving so much praise is, upon inspection, so difficult to decipher.<br />Prior to the release of OK Computer, the music industry, particularly pop music, had not seen or been overtaken by anything remotely similar to Radiohead's style before. The era of Pink Floyd and REM had been reduced to, for the former, stoners and classic rock stations, and for the latter, inner circles and disjointed releases. U2 was getting slammed finacially for POP, thier least true-to-form album ever, and Pearl Jam had completly slipped into artistic obscurity. The stage was being set for a band that could combine and bridge the worlds of artisan complexity, smart lyrics, expirmental soundscapes and driven, nailbiting music. Radiohead awnsered this call.<br />Radiohead is made up of five members and an alarming amount of guitars. Thom Yorke sings a nasaly, unrivaled british falsetto and a jagged guitar, Johnny Greenwood slaps a guitar (and, really, anything else he can find) and Ed O'Brian does the same, Colin Greenwood plays a thick, uniquely minimal-yet-complicated bass, and Selway's drumming is jazzy and upbeat. Before OK's release, Radiohead had only two more or less commerically unsucessful rock albums under thier belts, the former boasting a single whose immense popularity threatened to ruin thier career (\\"Creep\\") and the later, despite it's obvious power, simply never caught on. The most remarkable change between OK Computer and the release before it, The Bends, is that we see Radiohead completly transform from entertainers to artists.<br />OK Computer is a weird little album. It's subtle with it's theme, which ultimatly is the dehumanization of the modern world, and drenched thick with paranoia and ambition. OK Computer sounds like the voice of someone whom is about to loose his humanity, and stands as a stark, frightening message to all that care to listen to never stop fighting the machine in our lives. Perhaps the concept had been done before- The Wall, anyone?- but never before had it been done so sincerely, so fragile, and so, dare I say, confidently? At times Yorke sounds on the verge of breaking down, such as the soulful ballad of \\"Exit Music (For a Film)\\" that takes the concept of a Romeo-and-Juilet love story and turns it into a haunting call for escapism. At others, he sounds like a man possesed, afraid of nothing or anything that his actions may create, such as on \\"Electionering\\" and \\"Paranoid Android\\", where in the former he rants on the dark underbelly of politics and on the later he weaves the story of a obsessive compulsive indiviual consumed by paranoia.<br />Themes and motifs aside, OK Computer still sounds beautiful. Remove Thom Yorke's beautiful shine and you still have a collection of swirling, reverbing music that both hyponitizes and stimulates. It motivates, it explores, it challenges, and ultimatly, it brought back to life a reinasannce of creativty and artistry in pop music.ched thick with paranoia and ambition.

B00005JLWN|3.0|The distributor for Equilibrium, a modestly budgeted sci-fi thriller, had so little faith in it that it placed the film in just a few theaters in December, then let it die. One reason may be the title itself. In restaurants, some people are afraid to order a dish they cant pronounce. These same people tend to avoid movies whose titles they cant spell, pronounce and/or understand. Beyond that, Equilibrium was at the wrong place at the wrong time. Two other recent thrillers  AI: Artificial Intelligence and Minority Report  had already painted much richer and more elaborate portraits of life in the future. Finally, unlike other small sci-fi flicks like Gattaca, Equilibrium unwisely uses too much energy on special effects and not enough on the story, which might have been interesting if it hadnt been overwhelmed. <br />In this vision of the future, a third world war has resulted in a totalitarian society where all material things which cause people to feel emotion have been banned. People are also medicated daily to prevent them from feeling the anger and frustration which the government claims leads to war. Anyone who resists is dealt with immediately and harshly. Large SWAT teams swoop down on groups of resistors every day. In other words, this is a society that is continuously at war with war. <br />This plot concept, which isnt wholly original, could have proved fascinating, but it is clumsily handled and full of holes. The highlight is  Christian Bales carefully orchestrated performance as Cleric John Preston, a high ranking member of the group responsible for enforcing the regimes draconian measures. Preston, at first a totally unemotional man, ultimately sees the absurdity of his job and becomes a member of the resistance. <br />While not a noteworthy film, Equilibrium should provide many sci-fi fans with an enjoyable evening. It certainly isnt the worst movie of it type, but it could have beenso much more.
B0000027RM|5.0|I think, if anything, it's a testament to a band's merit that anyone would consider writing a serious review of their debut CD more then ten years after it first slided into mainstream America.<br />The 90s, and the early grunge era in general, were an intresting time. With it's profound, if not somewhat unwelcomed impact on mainstream music that will probably continue to saturate the airwaves for years to come, the three grunge bands that snaked from Seattle and into the hearts of misguided youth everywhere (Nirvana, Peral Jam, and Soundgarden) have created a legend and persona that, sometimes, almost seems to be bigger then itself. It's a shame that these three are forecfully combined into a Seattle tri-force, however, as they are three completly different entities, three different egos, and ultimatly, three completly different sounds and ideals, and nothing more can prove that then a collision course through the CDs.<br />This is a review of a particular entity in general, however, NOT a revolution and it's repercussions. Despite this, when reviewing something as influental and profound as Ten, it's hard to sepearte the two.<br />Ten is a rock album. It makes no bones about it, and even on softer tracks like \\"Black\\" and \\"Release\\", there is an edge, a power, an energy that spirals out of control, penetrating each and every note and vocal. Eddie Vedder, no matter how intellctual or level headed he may apper in interviews, just can't help himself when a guitar is being played. He growls, he yelps, he moans, he whails, he screams, he sings. There probably isn't much doubt that, if he were having an orgasm during any one of these songs, that the sounds couldn't be distingushed from the times he was merely singing. And in a subtle sort of way, there's something very sexy about a baritone monster that you can't tell if it's screaming or climaxing.<br />In addition to Eddie Vedder's unrelenting vocals, his lyrics follow the same ideal: there is an energy, and an anger hidden within his sometimes very abstract, disjointed thoughts. Often, it seems like a story is there, has been written and was, at one time, clearly legible, but when Eddie tries to tell it, he only gives the details of what's happening- broken thoughts here and there, a few punchlines, and perhaps a hint at things to come. He never, however, let's you leave with a sense of completion- the story is never over, and the writing never stops. A powerful statement, highlighted and hinted at with the CD beginning and ending with the same mellow, untamed melody.<br />There is much more here to find then the radio rocker \\"Jeremy\\", a song based on a adolescent shooting. Throughout the wave of oblique statements and hacked up dialouge, there are moments of unrequited love (\\"Black\\"), betrayal and abandonedment (\\"Why Go\\"), as well as a hope of rising up from the ashes of a painful moment. (\\"Alive\\") Poltical activism (\\"Porch\\") and pleas for help and/or mercy (\\"Release\\") are spread throughout the CD, as well.<br />This is not an album to end all albums anymore then, well, any other album you'll ever hear. Grunge soundscapes, no matter how beautiful or creative, are not everyone's cup of tea. But with an open mind and a strong sense of curoisty, and you'll discover a unique work of art, in the form of a very subtly titled CD by a bunch of dreamers from Seattle.dden within his sometimes very abstract, disjointed thoughts.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|\\"Say You Will\\" Resurrects Buckingham, Exhumes Nicks<br />By Dan Lambert<br />It was in the year 1973 that a pair of struggling singer-songwriters, having met and fallen very much in love as teenagers, released their first album.  \\"Buckingham Nicks\\" is now a coveted artifact to fans of Fleetwood Mac, the British blues band that ex-lovers Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks helped to steer toward pop stardom.<br />Thirty years later, Fleetwood Mac's new CD, \\"Say You Will,\\" represents a kind of Buckingham Nicks reunion.  Newly-absent is Christine McVie, but drummer Mick Fleetwood and bassist John McVie are still present and accounted for, making \\"Say You Will\\" sound like \\"Buckingham Nicks\\" with an improved rhythm section.<br />Advanced press has compared this latest offering from the warhorse of 1970's supergroups to their 1979 critical failure (but creative high-water mark) \\"Tusk,\\" but, sadly, the comparison is superficial:  \\"Say You Will\\" is not quite as innovative or cohesive as the Mac's earlier effort.<br />Like \\"Tusk,\\" \\"Say You Will\\" gives the lyrically- and musically hard-hitting Buckingham more room to flex his creative muscles than the Big Mac's more pedestrian efforts (such as 1977's overrated \\"Rumours.\\")  Weighing in only two shy of \\"Tusk's\\" generous twenty tracks, \\"Say You Will\\" provides plenty of bang for the buck.  Half of these tracks showcase Buckingham's gifts as a guitarist, producer, and writer.  \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" evoke Buckingham's sonic celebrations from the eighties:  \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Holiday Road.\\"  \\"Red Rover,\\" Peacekeeper,\\" and \\"Say Goodbye\\" are brilliantly-conceived, endlessly-listenable odes to hope and forgiveness.<br />Unfortunately, \\"Say You Will\\" plays it safer than the artistically-superior \\"Tusk.\\"  Christine McVie's overly-sunny, Clinton-campaign jingles are happily absent, but Nicks' lyrical treacle drips from this disc like a musical Ebola virus.  Even in \\"Illume,\\" her tribute to the victims of 9-11, Nicks masks her meaning in metaphor.  If the violent deaths of 3,000 of her countrymen can't spur Nicks to get to the point, what can?<br /> At its worst, \\"Say You Will\\" is like a collision between a solo Buckingham album and a solo Nicks album,  Lindsey's brilliant but commercially-inaccessible water trying unsuccessfully to mix with Stevie's musically-tuneless, lyrically-gaudy oil.  Many of Buckingham's songs were originally planned for a now-defunct solo project.  The marked contrast between these tracks and Nicks' efforts made me feel like I was listening to two albums simultaneously.<br /> At its best, \\"Say You Will\\" represents the welcome reunion of two gifted musicians.  The title track is proof that Buckingham excels at giving Nicks' songs a much-needed sonic polish.  The track joins \\"Angel\\" and \\"Gypsy\\" as one of Nicks' most listenable songs, making you want to get up and join her dance of whirling chiffon.  Be sure to listen to the song's closing few seconds:  Either Nicks is joined by a chorus of children at the end, or Buckingham is performing another delightful feat of sonic sleight-of-hand.<br /> This album won't help us find Saddam's weapons of mass destruction or oust the Bush administration, but it may motivate you to call Bill Clinton and thank him for bringing the Mac back together.r meaning in metaphor.

B00008S2VH|4.0|To compare this album to her vast body of work is pointless.  She has never made the same record twice in her stellar career.  She has always been about pushing the lyrical and musical envelopes while awakening the masses from their complacency.  <br />And Madonna has succeeded on both fronts.  Granted the music on American Life is not easily digestable, it does take several listens for it to sink in.  The lyrics are a bit...well she has never been a poet laureatte; however they are better than your Britney's and Christina's out there and they do manage to get the point across. <br />All in all this is an enjoyable album.  If you are looking for a musical quick fix, look elsewhere.
0066214122|3.0|There IS an important message to the reader in PREY - to be aware, and BEware, of boundless technological progress.  The enemy in PREY is not the nanotechnology that has gotten out of hand and started killing humans in the Nevada desert, but the humans who created it.  Sound familar?  Right - we already read JURASSIC PARK, and of course it's easier to fear dinosaurs than particles.  Crichton has always given readers plenty of pure fact and science in his fiction novels, but in PREY, at times, Crichton blinds the reader at time with scientific information more appropriate in a PhD dissertation than an action/sci-fi novel.  Usually when you finish a Crichton novel, you have learned a lot (and been entertained) without realizing how much you had learned.  CONGO and RISING SUN are good examples - total page turners with plenty of suspense, but a lot of underlying FACT.  When PREY gets rolling in the main story - panicked scientists trying to control swarms of nanoparticles that are evolving and becoming more intelligent with each passing hour - Crichton bombs the reader with pages of hardcore scientific fact and theory that, for many, may defy comprehension.  So it is difficult to feel the urgency and suspense over the plot line when you can't quite interpret the underlying point.  My favorite part of the book was the first half - before there was much science to it - when Crichton sets the table with the unemployed house-husband narrator observing his wife's strange behavior (suggestive of an affair) and his children's mysterious illnesses and broken appliances - all to be explained later.  Crichton writes so well about relationships and misery in them (as featured in DISCLOSURE as a couple deals with infidelity) to the point that the reader really sympathizes with the narrator well BEFORE he gets caught up in the scientific hysteria.  As for the action sequences, we follow the narrator and a team of scientists as they chase after, and are then chased by, these nanoswarms.  Some of the confrontations seems almost like schlock-sci-fi (with one mechanism stolen right from THE GREEN MILE) and I cannot see this book becoming a movie.  I enjoyed TIMELINE and AIRFRAME much more than this book, yet I know Crichton feels the message in PREY is much more important for all of us to grasp.  If only he had packaged it in his usual manner, maybe more readers would be able to grasp it.  Despite my mostly negative review, this IS a Crichton book, which, at its worst, is still heads above most fiction.  Enjoy!
B00005JLWN|5.0|I can't understand the critics lambasting this movie - the whole vision of it totally blew me away. It reminded me of the first time I went to see \\"Blade Runner\\" and the critics, at the time, mocked that picture too. Well, phooey to them and rent the thing. I mean it!!!<br />The cinematography is outstanding. I found the story pretty original and the action scenes kick .... Wimmer stresses and stresses and stresses ;o) how much he couldn't accomplish on a tight budget and timeframe - well, that's a bunch of c.... The whole feel of this thing is superb and outstanding. Geezus, he did a fantastic job. Kudos to Christian Bale and Emily Watson and the rest of the cast. Yes - the subject matter has been done before but Wimmer had the sense to add his own style to the whole piece.  I loved this movie!!!<br />It moved me not only as a dog lover ;o) but as a human being. Geezus. It is not \\"Minority Report\\" which I did not enjoy at all. <br />See this movie! Please?! <br />CMS
B00006M183|3.0|I know I am violating the code of PJ fans by saying anything remotely negative about the band - but RIOT ACT is average at best, and a far cry from where the band was even two albums ago with YIELD.  On the other hand, it is nice that they continue to put out albums every two years, and there are several standout tracks here - YOU ARE being the tops, with its unique synthesized arrangements (reminds me of the intro EMINENCE FRONT).  The fist single, I AM MINE, stays with you, and features an excellent guitar solo at the end wish you which would last longer.  Also enjoyable THUMBING MY WAY, a stripped down, acoustic reflective number (think of OFF HE GOES) and the driving SAVE YOU.  But there are more than a few tracks that either defy inclusion at all (HELP HELP) or just leave your memory once the song ends.  BUSHLEAGUER - which, musically, is mediocre, and lyrically is at best an indirect or occasional criticsm of George W. Bush - has garnered a bunch of attention (\\"born on third, thinks he hit a triple\\") - with singer Eddie Vedder wearing a Bush mask at European concerts before abandoning the mask (and then the song altogether) for the US leg of the tour after getting a lot of boos from fans AT the concerts.  Like BINAURAL before it, RIOT ACT only stays with me to the extent individual songs stand out - and fewer do here than on any of the other 6 PJ studio albums.  And whereas the first three albums, and the excellent YIELD, had so many amazing tracks that the whole ALBUM shined through, RIOT ACT is hardly a masterful \\"album\\" - just another decent album from a masterful band.  Despite my lukewarm feel for the album, the band is a STRONG AS EVER in concert and does not overwhlem its set list with songs from RIOT ACT.
B00008DDXC|5.0|While it still retains many of the elements that continue to make of the series a children's classic, I liked the second installment more than the \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" movie. The beginning was a little repetitive in some ways (Harry's family, the train departure, etc.) but past that, the movie took on a life of its own and became very enjoyable, with a whole plot woven around the existence of a terrible hidden Chamber of Secrets in Hogwarts. Some elements I found to be rather interesting were the uninvited house-elf (Dobby) and Dumbledore's beautiful Phoenix bird. Obviously deserved praise for the ingenious characters and their surroundings belongs to J.K. Rawling, the author of the books, but the movie in itself is capable to deliver a whole world of effects that blend very well into the brilliant story. With Mexican-born Alfonso Cuaron directing the next installment, the Potter movies promise to only get better with time, quite an accomplishment for sequels.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I am fed-up by 2 things here, the ravers and the ranters. <br />Given yes, this IS a gd debut for a newcomer, and there ARE really very few new artists out there who does this kinda music, but surely this does not warrant for people to go round yellin &quot;THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST!&quot;, cause it's JUST NOT, it's gd, but not ravingly fantastically fantabulous, please people.<br />And for those who put her down like there's no tomorrow, this CD DOES have its redeeming value, let's face it, she has an excellent voice, there are really very few newcomers who has voice of that gd a quality, so don't diss her like that just because you don't like her, cause it's grossly insulting.<br />Overall, I'd recommend this to 2 types of people, the diehard fans and the insomniacs. Honestly, while the music was relatively good, I found myself bored out and reaching out for the skip button many a time, so yeah, just my 2 cents' worth.
B000089RVX|1.0|Can you say over powering? Lay off on the 'urgency' as another reviewer mentioned. Too earnest and power chord-y. Vocals I guess are ok, unique but sort of wants to make you claw your ears out after just one song...too much! This is not really innovative as everyone raves about, it's just nu-metal with estrogen.
B000066NW0|4.0|As far as debut goes, this one rocks big time. Sure, it's the same pop-rock formula throughout, but Avril really shines in several moments in this album. Let's not talk about lyrics and go into the music, shall we, cause I believe that words shouldn't have to interfere with the music.<br />We have the powerful rockers (Losing Grip, Unwanted), we have the catchy pop-rockers/winning singles (Complicated, Sk8ter Boi), and we have the cool ballad-ish rockers (I'm With You, Naked), and we have country-ish stuff (Tomorrow). Really, this album covers quite abit, and they turn out to be very melodic, even if they ARE based on only a couple of pop hooks.<br />I have this to say to those who think she's just a punk wannabe, put away your prejudices and give this album a try, cause SERIOUSLY, you'll find yourself swaying to the beat, that's how cool it is.
0316666343|5.0|Can anyone truly imagine what life would be like without them in it?  What goes on when we are gone, both on earth or in Heaven (or in the realm of death in general)?  I found this book truly extraordinary in that it takes a tragic situation and builds a dramatic and sometimes light- hearted story of one girl's experience in answering these questions.  It is a must read!  I could hardly put it down, and it also left me with some things to ponder. This book stays with you because it focuses on issues that we all will have to eventually face. Beautifully written, too!
B00008LOS1|5.0|This Deluxe Version is newly remastered again and it sounds great. The live songs from the Vic are finally legally available for the first time.  Leslie West, formerly with Mountain, cooks on several songs recorded in New York.  Although Pete Townshend is a decent guitarist, it is nice to hear the Who with a great lead guitarist.
B000069HZP|5.0|This movie is incredible. It is the best movie I have ever seen!!! It definetly keeps you on the edge of your seat. In the beginning when the pranks begin to be played on him (Michael Douglas) it gets a little confusing because you have no clue what is going on. But as the movie unwinds and everything starts coming together. It's incredible how it all fits together like a perfect puzzle. I was surprised this movie came out in 1997. The ending or endings I should say are fantastic, even the endings are a twist!! I stayed up until 3:30 am watching this movie!!!
B00005YW4H|1.0|I was lured into downloading this album by hearing the song Don't Know Why on the radio.  Honestly, after track two, I couldn't find any more songs that even compare to Don't Know Why!  And yes, I listened to the whole album!  Now, why did this win so many grammys?!  Was it the pretty face on the cover?  Was it the fact that she plays piano?  This album reminds me of music played in the ocean liner ballroom during the opening scene of &quot;Ghostship&quot;!  Just watch that movie and you'll know what I'm talking about!  I definitely agree with the reviews that say this is great for insomniacs!
B00005JLRT|4.0|After the abysmal Star Trek film \\"Insurrection\\", the producers of Star Trek decided to take several years off from making Trek films until they could put together one that would trully shine.  After seeing \\"Nemesis\\", I would say they used the time wisely.  Star Trek Nemesis has an action packed, fast paced plot, that has everything that a good Trek film needs.  <br />Many of the elements of this film are clearly inspired by aspects of past Trek films.  For example, having a single lead foe, a heavy, for Captain Picard to square off against, is very reminiscent of Kirk's face off with Kahn in Star Trek 2, and is plotted almost as well.  This face off between foes also has a unique twist involving Picard's unusual connection with his enemy.  The fact that one of the Trek crewmembers sacrifices himself in the film obviously also reminds one of Star Trek 2 and Spock's death in that film.  Bringing in the Romulans into the picture was an excellent move, as they are a major villain of Trek who has been around even longer than the Klingons (first appearing in the early Season One episode of the original Trek, entitled \\"Balance of Terror\\").  There are also parallels to Star Trek 6 in this decision, having the Enterprise sent to open a new diplomatic dialogue with an old enemy, only to be sucked into a crisis that threatens galactic peace.  <br />The actors turn in excellent performances for the most part, and the main characters are plotted very well in this adventure.  I liked the fact that we had the customary Data quest for humanity stuff put in the film, but you don't get hit over the head with it as much in this picture.  Riker gets to play both romantic lead with Troi, and action hero when he takes on Remans who have boarded the Enterprise.  Picard is also given much more of an action role in this film, very reminiscent of how he was written in Star Trek First Contact.  <br />The action sequences in this film are some of the best of any of the Trek films.  Nemesis hasperhaps the longest ship on ship battle every put into a Trek film, and its one that will keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense.  The special effects are superb, and the visual imagery of the battle is spectacular.<br />Star Trek Nemesis definitely shows that there is still life in the Trek film franchise, while at the same time providing an excellent last hurrah for the Next Generation cast.  Plotting the next Trek film may be difficult (mainly because they have to decide which Trek crew they will have in the film), but this film shows that they can do it effectively given the correct mixture of story elements and proper planning.  With Nemesis on the big screen, and the continued excellence shown by Enterprise on the TV screen, Star Trek continues to provide excellent science fiction entertainment.
B000066NW0|3.0|The tracks Losing Grip, Complicated, and Unwanted are the best songs on this album.  The rest aren't necessarily unbearable...just average pop/rock songs I can hear from a local garage act.  Nothing special here, folks!  Just another overrated pretty face sitting or standing behind an instrument!  It's great background music for doing homework or some other important task, because there's not too much difference between the songs.  And by difference, I mean the tempo and sound is pretty much the same!  Actually, let me take back the unbearable part..because I just remembered one song I absolutely can't stand.  And that is Sk8er Boi!  Not only is the spelling of the title silly, so is the song itself!  Avril even attempts to rap in Nobody's Fool, but even that fails to capture my attention.  If you're still dying to get this, just buy or download the singles!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Of all of Manson's works, this one still stands out to me as the best. Because of the lyrics, the surprise of where he was coming from, and the sheer audacity of the cd. GOOD FOR EVERYONE!!!
B000069CWE|2.0|This was as big of a dissapointment as Evanescence's \\"Fallen\\" was to me. I REALLY REALLY REALLY liked Linkin Park's debut, Hybrid Theory. But this CD was pretty bad. I like the first track (Opening), track # 5 (Forgotten), and I kind of liked \\"My December\\" for a while. But the rest of the CD is pretty skip-able. I mean, the songs get kind of annoying after a while. The original HYBRID THEORY was 100x better than this. I see this CD as a ploy to get more money out of us. And boy, did they sure fool me! I recommend HYBRID THEORY over this. So, I'm pretty much saying to not buy this album. It's not worth the money. My favorite parts of the CD are they way they mixed up the words and formed weird words (ex. Forgotten to Frgt/10) and the CD cover art and stuff. But the CD itself wasn't that great. So, get Hybrid Theory before you get this!!! Enjoy! (um, kind of, hehe)
B000065V1V|5.0|I am a true Lover of David Bowie's for about 2 years now, becuase i am so young. I saw him on VH1 story Tellers, and Fell in LOve!! I have 8 of his cd's and Heathen is one of them. Heathen I believe is a wonderful album that shows how much David Bowie has grown has a Artist. He has sooo many wonderful albums out there and Heathen is one that should be added to any david Bowie Cd collection. It has a sound like Scary Monsters, and is very origianl in feel. Don't Listien to anyone who says it isn't Great becuase it is. This album shows he still has it, after... well i don't know i can't say after all these years becuase he has been around,lol. I don't think he will ever Loose it. Songs like \\"Catus\\" give it a edgy feel, and songs like \\"Everybody says Hi\\" gives it a slower tone. It is just a great mix for anytime and any place. 5 STARS to the good old Legendary ROCKER!
B00004Z459|5.0|OK, this really isn't my type of music. I usually listen to Alanis Morissette, Mariah Carey, and Sheryl Crow. But this CD is just awesome! I got it after hearing the songs \\"Crawling\\" and  \\"One Step Closer To You.\\" I like every single song on this CD. They are all really great. My favorites are: \\"Crawling,\\" \\"A Place For My Head,\\" \\"In The End,\\" \\"One Step Closer To You,\\" and \\"Cure For The Itch.\\" This is about 100x better than \\"Reanimation\\". That CD wasn't that good. But this CD, this is a masterpiece! I really recommend this CD to anyone, you'll love it. It has great guitar and lyrics. I love it. I used to listen to it at least 3 times every week. It's great!!!!!!! I can't say it enough times. I don't have \\"Reanimation\\" because I don't really like \\"Somewhere I Belong\\", so I can't compare the two. But get this CD! It's great! ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!
B00008H2LE|5.0|I think this is going to be Linkin Park's big album.  Yes, I know Hybrid Theory was big, but this'll be bigger.  The reason it hasn't gotten HUGE yet is because &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;  is really just a warmup.  It's not the best song on the album.  It's hard to place exactly what is, though.  It might be one their more experimental songs, like &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; which features live strings, a first for linkin park.  Or it might be one of the heavy, all out ravers like &quot;Faint&quot;.  but one song that i can't believe everyone is talking about is &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;.  the flute is a little weird, but my advice is to wait for chester's part in the chorus.  however, it is most likely that the masses will choose &quot;Numb&quot; as the HUGE hit.  this may seem strange to LP fans.  but remember, when you bought Hybrid Theory, did you think that &quot;In The End&quot; was the best song on the album?  most likely not.  it took the visual imagery and special effects of the video to drive it  home as that song they played on the radio every few minutes.  I won't even tell you to buy this album.  when it gets huge, you're going to buy it anyway.
B000089RVX|2.0|I decided to buy this CD after I really really liked the song \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and hearing them being compared to Linkin Park. Boy did I make a big mistake. I wasted my money on this! Sure, the lead singer's voice is angelic, and it's refreshing in a supposed male-run rock industry. But it just doesn't belong here. He voice is too pretty to be on this CD. The only songs that I liked where the first song, and \\"Bring Me To Life\\". They're both pretty good. The rest of the CD is pretty weird. It's even kind of spooky. It sounds like something that would be on a horror movie soundtrack. I am even thinking about selling this CD, something I have never done before. Nothing I have ever bought was this bad. I'm sorry, but this CD is just really bad. Linkin Park is WAY better. Get their CD's before even thinking about buying this awful thing. Music industry, oh Music industry, what is happening to you! What an awful slump the music biz is in. Well, for those of you who actually like this CD, ENJOY!!!!! (I know I sure didn't)
B00005JKPF|5.0|Having watched X-Men 2 and the Matrix: Reloaded, I must say I enjoyed the former much better. While the Matrix: Reloaded semed to have lost its storyline to EXTENDED and meaningless action sequences, X-Men 2 revels in good storytelling, superb acting and sufficient special effects.<br />Essentially a good versus evil story, this installment sees  Strykler, a military scientist, fuming over his own son's mutany condition and seeking revenge on the mutants. Vowing to eliminate all mutants, he engagaes a war with Professor Xavier and gang, who seeks help from enemy mutant, Magneto. The story may be predictable but is greatly helped by solid acting from Ian McKellan, Patrick Stewart, Jack Hughman and Halle Berry.<br />As usual, props go out to Ian McKellen for his excellent portrayal of Magneto, a great combination of evilness and contempt.<br />This is ultimately a very enjoyable movie for any moviegoer wheather you are an X-Men or not.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I heard a few John Mayer songs on the radio and thought, jeez, this guy can sing! I first just wanted his CD because of No Such Thing. I got the cd and it was JAM PACKED with awesome lyrics and a rythmical voice!<br />1) No Such Thing-I memorized this song in a matter of minutes it was so good, it has a great beat!!!<br />2)Why Georgia-Again, great beat and memorized it fast. It has a great melody and easy to listen to. <br />3) My Stupid Mouth- Hahah! This is a really funny song!!! I enjoyed it a lot! It talks about him screwing up by saying stupid stuff at a date. <br />4) Your Body Is a Wonderland-Not my favorite, has good lyrics but a little....intimate to say the least.<br />5)Neon- Very very cool. Its a slick modern song and its very catchy, im hoping they play it on the radio soon.<br />6) City Love-This is a song that is sooo radio worthy. Its so smooth and the lyrics would clean up the average love song about \\"I need you come home i dont have dignity\\" with \\"i got a city love, i found her in Lydia, and i cant remember life before her name.\\"<br />7)83- This is my absolute favorite on the cd. ITS JUST SOOO FUN! Who wouldnt want a song about being six again. Its wholesome!<br />8) 3x5-I love this song. Plain and simple, great song, and easy to get stuck in ur head. Just hearing the title got it stuck in my head!<br />9)Love song for No One-This song is rather catchy!!! I enjoy listening to it and it is one of those \\"i need you\\" songs but a very very good one and it has a fast pace stuck-in-your-head beat!<br />10) Back To You- Good song, good lyrics, but kinda average... good at first but once u get in to it......u flip to the next one.<br />11)Great Indoors- This song has awesome lyrics but its not my favorite.<br />12) Not Myself- Havent taken the time to listen to it.<br />NO NUMBER THIRTEEN<br />14)St Patricks Day-Slow but a good song for anytime of the year. Very understandable and relate-to lyrics<br />OVERALL- Buy this cd, its worth the money!!!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Yes this is a fine album indeed. But it doesn't sound like a Fleetwood Mac album. Instead it sounds like a Stevie Nicks solo album and a Lindsay solo album mixed mish mashed together through my changer's programmer under Fleetwood Mac's name. Part of it is the loss of Christine McVie, whose strong singing and melodies were able to bring the group together, and make them sound like a whole and not three parts. A large part of it though is that by the time the group all gathered together to start recording, Lindsay had finished many of the songs without the rest of the band. Even Stevie's songs sound like they were outtakes from Trouble in Shangri-La, with Lindsay overdubbed in later on. Only a handful of the songs sound as if all the band members were involved at one time (Peacekeeper, title track, Miranda, etc.)<br />Nevertheless, it is a fine collection of catchy, melodic songs, and it's great to see some of the best are still able to pull it off with style and class. Nobody combines classical, techno, Beach Boy rock like Lindsay does, and Stevie is still the world's #1 gypsy rock 'n' country witch. Patch things up with Bob Welch before the next tour, and we just might have the most perfect band in the world!
B00003CXWV|5.0|This is a great film...first of all as far as historical accuracy this film nails it where it counts.  I.e.  the names of cartels and dealers within the U.S. are totally accurate.  2nd the film is brilliant because it shows the highs and lows of making money illegally.  Whether the dude from boston who gave this one star knows it or not...if the right things had happened to him...he could be a George Jung himself.  P.S.  to the dude in boston, hope they get that whole drinking water situation fixed up there...its really affecting your mental health.
B00006GEXQ|4.0|This was one of the sweetest \\"chick flicks\\" I've seen in a while is what a boy I know said about this movie.  He couldn't have been more right.  This movie was a great coming of age story that showed the insecurites we all live through in our teenage years and how they still affect us in our adult lives.  Hugh Grant played a great carefree playboy, Will, who didn't appear to have any frustrations in life other than who his next conquest would be.  This all changes when he meets Marcus, a boy seriously in need of a stable adult presence in his life.  Marcus is a teenager who is faced with the same teenage problems we all were faced with, being the odd one at school and having a vegitarian sucidal mother who will not let him eat McDonalds. Marcus latches on to Will to learn about life, love, and what it means to be happy.
0440236738|5.0|On her deathbed, Will Klein's mother tells him that his assumed-dead brother is really alive, and from there unfolds an incredibly complex series of events, cover-ups, and moments of violence and mystery that take the reader on quite a ride.<br />Klein's brother was implicated in the death of Will's ex-girlfriend, and it becomes apparent that he may have been involved in much more than just that - or maybe not.  A string of colourful characters passes through the books pages, each one making an impression and playing a role in the complicated mystery.  Among the more memorable is Klein's devoted friend Squares who works with runaways, The Ghost who is an incredibly violent and dangerous friend of Klein's brother, and various other people, including a go-getting out of town journalist and a pathetic ex-hooker.  <br />Coban has a great ear for dialogue, and I can only imagine the time it must have taken to plan such a detailed, twisting plot.  His ability to bring to life characters that only appear for a short time is something other writers should learn.  His plotting and periodic surprises keeps the story moving and always exciting.  I don't know if Hollywood will make a movie out of this one, but it would be difficult to capture all that is happening in the story.  It's a great read.
B00007KLJJ|2.0|Summary:<BR>Harry Faversham (Heath Ledger) is the son of a famous military officer and is a star cadet in an upscale military training school in England.  He is surrounded by friends that adore him and is in love with a woman that everyone seems to think is beautiful, Ethne (Kate Hudson).  But when it comes time to go to war, Harry ops out and disgraces both himself and his family.  As a result, three of his closest friends and his now fiancée, Ethne, give him white feathers, symbolic of cowardice.  <br />The gesture gets to Harry and he ends up deciding to prove everyone wrong by going to the war zone anyway and doing his best to protect his friends.  While there he meets an African native who becomes the best example of friendship in the entire movie, Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou), and is probably the coolest character.  The movie kind of ends ambiguously and you are left wondering about a lot of things.<br />My Comments:<BR>Combining this movie with Changing Lanes for a night of entertainment, which my wife and I did, was a major mistake.  Both of the movies just drag on and on.  <br />This one actually has one major scene that is pretty exciting (when the British regiment is tricked and ambushed), but the rest of the movie is very slow - especially the beginning.  I can understand that the intent is to delve into the relationships of the characters and the mind of Harry, but there are still a lot of completely unnecessary scenes that don't advance the story at all.<br />As for the acting, it wasn't too bad.  My wife was convinced by it and I especially liked Djimon Hounsou and Wes Bentley (who played Jack Durrance).  Heath Ledger wasn't too bad, but I think he actually had a pretty bad story to work with, which isn't really his fault. <br />As for the story, it was very much piecemeal.  It jumped from here to there and, though it wasn't hard to follow, it wasn't always clear why they were leaving some things out and including some things that seemed completely irrelevant.  I think the story was just lacking a clear and linear plot, despite not having anachronistic scenes.<br />Overall, except for the ambush scene and the scenes involving Djimon Hounsou, the movie was kind of boring.  It doesn't move very fast and doesn't really suck you into the relationships and characters and get you to relate.  This is definitely one you can skip.

B00005JKPF|5.0|When I first saw X-men 3 years ago, I was a little worried about Bryan Singer's approach to making the film.  After being an advid X-men fan from childhood to present, it seemed like tampering with story lines and setting things in \\"reality\\" was not the proper way to approach an X-men movie.  I was, of course, wrong; and the movie turned out very well.<br />Coming into its sequal I had high bars I expected it to be able to clear, and it did so with no problem.  First off, Nightcrawler, aka Kurt Wagner, was amazing.  He is by far the best characterization I have seen yet in the X-men movies.  He lept from the pages of the book to the screen rich in detail, and full of the essence of what the x men stand for.  Whether it be because of 9/11, the war in the middle east, or simply by pure accident, heavy ideals were laced in the film that maybe were or were not intended.  These ideals make X2 have a very emotional core.  Its alright to have religious beliefs, its alright to look different, and its alright to be lost, as long as we work for the same goal.<br />Wolverine was stunning and finally going berserk the way he is famous for in the books.  New Mutants abound for cameos including Colossus, Siren, Kitty Pryde, and Douglas, and some familiar faces resurface for more sustained roles such as Bobby 'iceman' Drake, Pyro, and Rogue.<br />The action and special effects sequences were well done. The story was cohesive, even for people who never picked up a comic book, and the tear jerking climax set up definite potential for a third movie.  Anyone whos read the series knows roughly whats coming next, and those who don't might pick up a comic who never have before just to find out a little about what comes next.<br />I could go on all night about the movie, getting into specifics but I will let anyone who reads this see it for themselves and develop thier own feelings.  Those who didn't like it, I don't know why, but please understand what you are talking about.  I have beena fan of Bryan Singer since the Usual Suspects, and look forward to further X-scalades from him.  The DVD can not come soon enough.  Thank you Bryan.

6305781427|5.0|I'm not a fan of &quot;new age&quot; music. However, I am a fan of Yanni Live at the Acropolis. The location of this concert is under the ancient Greek parthenon. The production of the show is great, the lighting makes the ancient theatre seem like it's in the same shape as it were in its prime. I saw this on PBS a long time ago and I haven't lost interest in the music since; the DVD reaffirms to a greater extent. Something special took place at the Acropolis that night and the video recreates most of the show.<br />The DVD is in 5.1 digital audio and the sound is superb. Yanni's music is awe-inspiring moving, and emotional. The concert was Yanni's return to Greece from his long departure to America. The emotions are flowing, he dedicates a song to his mother; the band and especially the violinist in the red dress play amazingly. Finally, the concert ends with Yanni addressing &quot;a thought&quot; to the audience concerning the human condition and ends the show to a standing ovation. One can only wonder what the ancient Greeks would think of this show after viewing Yanni: Live at the Acropolis. I think that they'd like it. I recommend this to anyone.

B000002KHY|5.0|James Taylor was and is one of the greatest singers in rock. He also ranks amongst the top songwriters. Fire and Rain is considered his best but after listening to the whole album you'll find some songs better than it.<BR>Something in the Way She Moves- This is a great love song.<BR>Carolina in My Mind- A song in which JT is yearning for home a great song maybe his best.  <BR>Fire and Rain- As I said, not his best although it is a beautifully written song.   <BR>Sweet Baby James- This is very catchy and it is hard not to love.  <BR>Country Road- Probably the best on this CD.  <BR>You've Got a Friend- This is not an original. It is by Carole King, but his arrangment makes it his own.        <BR>Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight- Probably the worst on here but still great.        <BR>Walking Man- Wonderful story song        <BR>How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)- How can you resist the smooth harmony vocals.        <BR>Mexico- Pretty good.        <BR>Shower the People- 4th best        <BR>Steamroller- This live version is better than the original.<BR>Anyone who says JT's music is boring must not have ears!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Wow, Madonna really did it this time.  She's almost 50 years old and can still crank out the tunes.  Considering she writes alot of her own songs and can play a few licks on the guitar, she has really proved herself to be a fantastic artist.  She's still got plenty to say and her music is constantly evolving.  This album is so much better than \\"Music\\".  It's more consistant and has more upbeat tracks on it, which Madonna does best.  I've grown to love the title track \\"American Life\\". Any true Madonna fan can relate to the lyrics.  I love the rap at the end of the song, it sort of reminds me of the way Dee-lite used to groove, \\"cuz you know i'm satisfied\\"....... My favourite song would have to be \\"Nobody Knows Me\\".  ....  I also like \\"I'm So Stupid\\" (good lyrics), \\"Hollywood\\", and \\"Mother and Father\\".  The lyrics on this album are intense, it's nice to hear Madonna truely expressing herself.  I just heard the song \\"Holiday\\" in a club recently, and it made me realize how much Madonna has changed and grown as an artist.  You have to give her credit for staying in the game this long and still putting out great music.  You go Miss Thang!
0451169514|4.0|This book is long and some parts are boring but overall it is a good book in my opinion. I really enjoy Stephen King's work. He is one of my favorite authors. If you enjoy reading somewhat scary novels I would recommend this one.
B0000524CY|5.0|Horror is the right word to describe this classic confrontation of good and evil.  The opening frames of the film establish clearly that the devil has been and continues to be a frightening and destructive force in the world.  Father Merrin, played well by Max von Sydow, discovers a small statue of the devil at an archeological dig in Northern Iraq.  He has battled with this nemesis before and now he has come to the end of his life with the battle unresolved.  The last scene in Iraq shows Father Merrin face to face with a large statue of the devil.  The sun, heat, and dessert winds swirl around the two antagonists.  All that follows in the film is foreshadowed by this dramatic encounter.<br />The rest of the film takes place half a world away from the desert of Irag at a home near Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.  Chris McNeil, played by Ellen Burstyn, is making a film on the campus of Georgetown and we see her arguing with her director about her lines.  In the background watching the argument is Father Karras, played by Jason Miller.<br />It won't be long before Chris seeks out the help of Father Karras with a problem she is having with her 12 year old daughter Regan, played wonderfully by Linda Blair, who won a Golden Globe for her performance.  It appears as if Regan may be possessed by the devil.  Modern medicine is powerless to help Chris deal with the frightening changes and behavior of her daughter.<br />At first Father Karras, a psychiatrist, is skeptical of Chris's contention that her daughter is possessed, but after a couple of interviews with Regan he requests permission to conduct an exorcism.  Father Merrin, now located in upstate New York, is an experienced exorcist and is assigned to this case.  The two priests join forces to drive out the devil from young Regan.<br />This battle between the priests and the devil residing in Regan is filled with scene after scene of violent and explosive confrontations.  The devil exhausts the aged Father Merrin, who is capable and well intentioned, but simply not strong enough for the fight.  Father Karras does have the strength, but not the psychological or spritual maturity to contend with a truly powerful and intellectually superior antagonist.<br />Is all this Hollywood nonsense or a genuine reenactment of an age old fight to free people from demonic possession?  Each viewer will have his or her own answer to the question and the answer is likely to determine the extent of the power of the film to be frightening and disturbing.<br />Whatever the beliefs of the viewer, it is certain that the film is exceptionally well written, directed and acted.  The author of the best selling novel (which I also recommend), William Peter Blatty, was unsure that he could adapt his novel into a first-rate screen play.  An Academy Award for best screenplay in 1973 answered his question.<br />William Friedkin, the director, used all of his art to create the look, feel, and sound of the ultimate battle of good and evil played out in the bedroom of a frightened little girl.  Thirty years after this film was made it still has the power to chill us with its realistic portrayal of the ultimate horror, being possessed by the devil.<br />The DVD has the added benefit of a complete explanation by Director Friedkin of all the choices he made as he shot this film.  Additionally, some added scenes, the famous spider walk, the hosptialization of Regan as she undergoes a variety of torturous tests, and various images of the devil subliminally cued into the film, set the DVD apart from the video most people have seen and experienced.<br />Seldom has evil been filmed in so frightening a fashion.

B0000542D2|5.0|As I say in my title, this is my favorite movie of all time.  I bought this DVD with high expectations and I got them.  Sure, some of the extra features are lame- but can't we just rate this on the film itself?<BR>   I think this is one of the funniest films in the history of cinema.  It is just so WEIRD.  The dialog is fast-paced and all four Beatles shine in at least one scene (my personal favorite is George in the TV executives office).  <BR>   This is an excellent film, not only for Beatles fans but for anyone who likes a great movie.  Have fun!

B00008S2VG|5.0|I have been a long standing Madonna fan for years, and the release of a new album by her is always a big event in my life. American Life lives up to what I expected.<br />The best thing about Madonna is that she never stays still, never falls into one sound and stays with what may be commercialy viable. That key factor has been what has made her a pop icon for the last 20 years, and what still drives her today.<br />The first song on American Life, the title track, explores not only America's, but the worlds distorted view on what is percieved to be the real goals of life. <br />Fame, fortune and success. Madonna focuses her time on this track telling the listener that maybe this famous way of life isn't all its cracked up to be. Who better to say than Madonna? And what better way to do it than over thumping Mirwais techno bleeps?<br />'Hollywood' is a great song awesome lyrics and a driving beat that I think deserves some good radio time. Great production.<br />Even though I believe this album to be her third best work (Behind 'Ray Of Light' and 'Like A Prayer') I'm not going to discuss every track on this album. I will mention that 'Nothing Fails' is probably one of the best songs Madonna has ever written.<br />Buy it and discover it for yourself.<br />Five out of Five
B00008S2VG|2.0|I have looked forward to the new Madonna CD, and the first single, Amarican Life is a very good tune, but the rest is not.<BR>I prefer ray of light and Music instead of this one.
0060925000|5.0|Seth's novel has all the elements of a page-turner: love and loss, political and personal scandals, familial conflict, birth and death, and even two crucial court cases. The interwoven stories at times seem to drag on, but when they build to a climax, readers realize that the extended introductions and seemingly-insignificant details of daily life serve to make us truly care about the fortunate and shocking fates of the characters. <BR>While it has all the elements of an intriguing soap-opera, the wealth of information about Indian society and the stinging social critiques Seth offers should not be underscored. Indeed, his novel gives us at least a taste of virtually everything that is beautiful, fascinating, troubling, and disgusting about India.<BR>My only criticism of the book is that without quite a bit of prior knowledge about North and East Indian culture, the reader is bound notice several important puzzle pieces missing that would otherwise make for a more fulfilling read. I've spent several months in the country, and I was still missing bits and pieces. My suggestion would be to travel the country first- if finances don't permit, buy the reader's guide.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is absolutely perfect.  Although it is by now cliche to sing the praises of this album, it is truly a classic album that everyone should listen to.  This music is simply unbelievable -- it is moving and catchy, and deep.  Because the album stirs such deep emotions, it almost does it a disservice to reduce the experience of listening to it to words -- hence this rambling review.  You have to trust these reviews and simply get it.
0792153189|4.0|Not enough time and too many plot lines killed this movie.  <br />First we have the plot line of a High School student that discovers a comet that will kill us all  <BR>Second we have an ammeter reporter that blows the cover on the whole thing <BR>Third we have the reactions of a president and how he deals with the coming crisis safeguarding his people and suchlike <BR>Fourth we have a mission in space to go and destroy the big bad comet before it kills us all.  <br />While individually these plot lines are good and the ending is satisfying I thought that they all rushed together sometimes the action was too quick sometimes it was too slow.  <BR>This is one of those movies that could have been great if it could have known what it wanted and had an actual plan of attack.  As it is the film sort of stumbles about haphazardly with moments of real insight breaking in often.  <br />Overall-Good movie if you like drama, but don't confuse this with Armageddon it is not a comedy.

6303027016|5.0|I really like GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM. Robin Williams as Adrian Cronauer is just terrific. His performance is both extremely funny and unsettlingly moving. J.T. Walsh as Sergeant Major Dickerson is outstanding as Williams' adversary. GOOD MORNING, VIETNAM contained one of composer Alex North's last scores, which was quite effective in the film's dramatic latter segment. Williams' frenetic pace is at times non-stop. Thus film grows more interesting with each viewing catching a little piece here or there that you didn't notice the time before.
B00006RAKP|3.0|This is a nice compilation of the Radio-Friendly Era of Elton John. HOWEVER, I don't like the fact that the Tumbleweed Connection album was ignored. Not even 1 SONG? It's his best album, Hands down (in fact &quot;Tumbleweed&quot; is the only Elton album I pull off the shelf and play on a regular basis). Song's like &quot;Ballad of a well known gun&quot; and &quot;Son of your father&quot; are Elton classics, and their absences are glaring. So for that reason, I give &quot;Greatest Hits 1970-2002&quot; only 3 Stars.
6300182576|4.0|The outstanding outdoor scenery of this somewhat ordinary Western makes it noteworthy. Besides the scenery there is also a very good cast headed by Clint Eastwood that includes Robert Duvall, John Saxon, Don Stroud, and James Wainwright. This was director John Sturges' second to last Western. This was also one of the last Westerns that looked like those classic Technicolor and widescreen Westerns to come out of the 1950's. It's filled with panoramic landscapes of wide-open plains, billowing skies and majestic mountains. Lalo Schifrin's score more befitting of the 70's seemed to lethargically bring that era of filmmaking to an end with this film.
B000059XY3|2.0|Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones were the only two things that saved this movie from being a total disaster. While Val Kilmer may have looked better for the part of Wayne, that was the only good thing about him. Kilmer, O'Donnel, and even Nicole Kidman simply didn't work for this movie. there was no chemistry between any of them. Jim Carrey was the obvious choice for the Riddler, and he was histerical. And although I was a bit surprised at the casting of Tommy Lee Jones for Two-Face, he did a brilliant job. He has a real flair for playing psychotic. Those two were the only things that saved this movie from being a total disaster, and frankly, if they had cut out all other scenes and just shown the scenes with those two in them, I would have been happy.

Worlds are taken apart and put back together - both spiritualy and physically! Be prepared to use your imagination and get ready for a great story.
6303168507|5.0|Beautifully written, directed and carried out.  Very realistic.  Absolutely everyone should have to see this movie.  No one should ever be allowed to forget what took place during that time, no one should be allowed to ignore it, and whatever restitution we can manage should be done.

B0000028M7|4.0|i am a new fan to Alice In Chains and i wanted to get all their records. I bought Nothing Safe-The Best of the Box, and loved it.<BR>I was looking at reviews for Dirt and people are saying one of the bst albums ever so i was like man it sounds great! I went out,bought it, and i am dissapointed. First of all, i love evey SINGLE from dirt very much, songs like Rooster,Them Bones, and Would? are incredible. But the others are the see-saws.<BR>A Song that is good at the beginning but ends up a song that will be forgotten is Sickman.The Worst of the song is when Layne starts screaming into the slower pattern.The other song i would like to point out is Hate To Feel.How could you make a chorus like that and call it a song.The rest of the CD is well done and Junkhead is a masterpiece but,God Smack and Dirt are not the greatest songs either in my opinion.
B0000931OG|4.0|There have been plenty of horrible diatribes written about Blur's seventh studio album, \\"Think Tank.\\" It has been said that the LP is dull, disjointed, or, most hilariously, non-melodic.  \\"Think Tank\\" is, in fact, yet another excellent (though imperfect) Blur album, one that surpasses the recent \\"13\\" and falls just short of the classic \\"Parklife.\\" <br />It is bursting with ideas, soaked in an opulent creativity and freeform vision that few pop bands outside of The Beatles have been able to replicate. One gets the idea that basically anything goes here--there are no boundaries, no self-conscious limitations or overt imitations. This album boldly sits on a plane alone, equipped with a unique vibe and an infinite vision.<br />The album opens with \\"Ambulance,\\" a shapeless epic where Alex James' sonorous bassline underscores a gliterring array of soulful backing vocals, ephemeral keyboards, and rich saxophone. When Damon Albarn sings \\"I ain't got nothing to be scared of,\\" it is clear that he has never sounded so genuine and expressive, so raw and direct. And this is only the beginning. \\"Out of Time\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever committed to record, with a full Moroccan orchestra sprinkling a vague fourth dimensionality atop the song's hazy vibe. \\"Good Song\\" is just that--an excellent tune with a scratchy, primitive, and transcendent riff that is alluring in its careful subtlety. \\"We've Got A File On You\\" proves that Blur could flat-out destroy all the other punk bands in the world if they really wanted to. And the closing ballad \\"Battery In Your Leg\\" (the only song that Coxon appears on) is truly a monument to beauty--Albarn's fragile vocals and lonely piano propped up with a dramatic, mutilated rush of notes from Coxon's guitar that sounds like Kevin Shields dabbling in exotica. And don't forget the hidden track \\"Me, White Noise\\" (it can be found by holding rewind at the beginning of \\"Ambulance\\")--it is a storming, seven-minute symphony drenched in creepy rhythms, Phil Daniels' dark, cockney musings, and Albarn's psychotic chorus.<br />Coxon's departure is definitely both a blessing and a curse.  On one hand, his absence proves that James was just as important in the band's overall aesthetic.  However, the loss of such a guitar virtuoso is felt in many of the record's soft spots, where cluttered experimentation often drags down several songs--the meandering \\"Jets\\" is about 3 minutes too long, \\"Crazy Beat\\" is overtly commercial and somewhat annoying with its sampled voice, and \\"Caravan\\" is incredibly slow and even boring. <br />However, the good songs far outshine the bad ones, making \\"Think Tank\\" another glowing piece in the Blur canon.  It's no \\"Parklife,\\" but it is still far better than most other albums released this year.
B0000035E7|4.0|This CD does not get nearly the attention it should have gotten. I actually rate this as my favorite Nirvana CD, not to take anything away from the others, but this is just Nirvana being who they were, playing on raw emotion and energy. The year is 1989 and Hair metal {A.K.A. Mullit rock} is still hitting the charts hard. While this CD is virtually unnoticed the likes of Skid Row, Warrant, and other so-called hard rock bands are getting some serious play on mtv and radio. Quite amazing!!! I honestly did not buy this CD until 1994, and I can tell you it was one of the best alternative rock CDs I have ever bought. I agree with most of the reviews pertaing to quality and overall sound of the CD being somewhat poor, but that is actually the beauty of this. This CD is the birth of northwest rock, alternative, grunge, garage rock, whatever you want to call it. Of course no disrespect to the Pixies, who were trendsetters themselves. Dave Groehl does not play drums on any tracks which is a bummer. But Dave didn't join the band till later on, prior to nevermind. Just remember it is very different from any other Nirvana CD. It is not as refined as later Cds, but is worth a try.
0316666343|5.0|This extraordinary book is definitely one of my favorites. It's an inspirational and emotional book that gives you a new look on life. It's about a 14 year old girl named Susie, who got raped and killed and in this book Susie tells the story, while she's in heaven watching over her family and her love ones. Susie introduces to you the pain that her family goes through and that's what makes the book unforgettable. There were points where I mourned with her family and points where I was angry with her mom and the killer. When I read this book I felt like I was every character in the book. I understood what each character was going through and it made me cherish my life more. The Lovely Bones was a lovely story that you couldn't put down until you know that the killer had his consequences. I would recommend this book to people 13 years old and up.

I only saw Aretha Franklin and Mariah singing like &quot;Diva Live&quot; and have a lot surprises. Mariah also did a great and fun address than the other divas. She also saved a little power in &quot;Chain, Chain, Chain&quot; with Aretha Franklin. Both legend singer and writers (Aretha Franklin and Carole King) gave her the most attention. Obviously, Mariah lead the other divas. It is a pity that she seem not focus on music so much as before.

B000003S0P|5.0|My introduction to King Crimson was their debut, \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\".  I love that album.  Since then, I have been getting their albums roughly in order, and I have quite a few of them now (though not nearly all of them).  I think, so far, that \\"Red\\" stands out as my absolute favorite.  Robert Fripp is one of the best guitarists and composers out there, and his work on this album certainly shines.<br />At this time, John Wetton was singing and playing bass for Crimson.  He's a great singer and a killer bass player (check out \\"Larks' Tongues In Aspic\\" for more great stuff with him).  Bill Bruford of Yes had also become the drummer of King Crimson, and he's totally amazing.  His fills are all over the place, and he's a master of odd time signatures.  King Crimson is joined by some excellent musicians on this album.  David Cross adds his violin playing to a few tracks and Ian McDonald is a noteworthy sax player.  One thing that makes King Crimson a unique rock band to me is that they don't just play guitar solos all the time, but they use many other instruments as well.  This gives them a sound that is very much their own.<br />The title track is probably my favorite on here, with the possible exception of \\"Starless\\".  The title track takes you through metal riffs and hypnotizing time signatures.  Amazing work from Bruford on this track.  \\"Fallen Angel\\" is a sad ballad, and has beautiful chord changes and vocals.  The chorus is intense.  \\"One More Red Nightmare\\" is a metallic-hard rocker that doesn't sound very dated at all.  The guitar playing is a perfect example of how amazing Fripp is, even without playing a solo.  The sax solo rules, too.  \\"Providence\\" has a long, violin opening.  The other instruments come in slowly.  Robert Fripp lets out some feedback and John Wetton does some bass-soloing, and then Bill Bruford starts keeping a beat and Fripp starts soloing.  This is an excellent build-up, although many will probably not have the patience to listen to the whole thing.  It never really gets the drive going like a regular song, but the instruments play off each other so well.  \\"Starless\\" is possibly my favorite.  It starts off like a ballad, with beautiful chord changes and painfully sad vocals.  This part of the song is absolutely beautiful, and I often lose myself in it.  About 5 minutes in, it takes an evil turn with a bass riff in 13/8.  The build-up is perhaps one of the most intense things I've ever heard.  That's all I can say, really.  I can't exactly describe it, just that it's incredibly intense and powerful.  <br />I'd recommend this to the progressive hard rock and metal fan, but be warned of a few things.  It's not a happy album; The cover should give you a general idea of the album's mood.  Also, this is just not your average rock album.  You might need to give it time to get into it, or you might never get into it.  I hope you dig it though, because I sure do.  I haven't heard anything this good in a long time.

0802130208|1.0|A Confederacy of Dunces.  John Kennedy Toole.  New York: Grove Press, 1980. 394 pg.<br />Many high school students detest reading novels.  Students have come to hate reading because of dry, slow, or overly difficult novels chosen by their teachers.  A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole is a perfect example of this type of novel. The story is about Ignatius, an obese man in his thirties that still lives with his mother and always stumbles into unusual situations. The slow plot and the ineffectiveness of the novel to captivate the reader only further restrain the reader's ability to enjoy the novel. Because of this disability, readers will find it difficult to empathize with Ignatius.  A Confederacy of Dunces was long, drawn out, difficult to read and utterly pointless.<BR>The author's style is very unique.  John Toole uses precise words for describing not only character's emotions, but also everything else, \\"A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once,\\" (1).  In this, the very first sentence of the story, the reader understands what an fatiguing read this novel will be.  Because of the extensive descriptions the book seems ten times longer than it is.  In Ignatius' diary,  Toole uses language that is difficult to follow and focus on because of the complicated phrases and his long descriptions.    For example, \\"We must hasten back on the wings of prose to the factory and its folk, who prompted my rather lengthy digression...and subsequent pratfall the sources of a great feeling of camaraderie.\\"(123).  The slow moving plot is another reason as to why the book is laborious to read.  It is hard to concentrate and keep focus when there is so little action in the story and so much repetition.<BR>This constant repetition becomes annoying and tedious to read.  The entire story is surrounded by Ignatius' entries continuously repeating what has already been said.  For instance, the reader finds out from an eye-witness account from Mr. Levy that, \\"\\"What are you people doing down there on the floor?\\"(86). Again the reader gets another account of the situation, when just pages later Mr. Levy states, [...]  When I went there this morning everybody was on the floor.  Don't ask me what they were doing.  It could have been anything,\\" (98). Unsurprisingly, the same instance is brought up again this time in Ignatius's journal, \\" My downfall occurred literally [...]  and I plummeted to the floor [...],\\" (122). While Toole tries to allow the reader to see from the different character's point of views, he just makes it more lengthy and dull.  <BR>The author's style and the weak connection between the characters and reader made John Kennedy Toole's novel, A Confederacy of Dunces, monotonous and unexciting.  I would not recommend this book to anyone ...  but there are always exceptions to any rule.  To people who have a large vocabulary or who have trouble sleeping at night; this is the book for you.
0792157850|5.0|This, the second film of the trilogy, is an anomoly amongst the the series.  Whereas \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"The Last Crusade\\" are rather lighthearted (sometimes slapstick), jolly affairs throughout, with most of the action grounded in reality and Western civilization (Indy vs. the Nazis), \\"Temple of Doom\\" plunges you into a world that shocks and horrifies most in today's civilized societies, one that has the power to truly disturb and repulse you while at the same time gluing you to your seat.  Whereas the first and last films have heavy reliance on Indiana's witticisms, this middle piece keeps them to a minimum, heightening the tension and seriousness of the plot and action (although they are certainly not completely absent).  Whereas the bookending films' events are all grounded in reality, with scientific explanations for everything (except, of course, the opening of the Ark of the Covenent), this central feature has many instances that can be explained only by voodoo curses (it's not actually voodoo, but definately akin to it), and this too heightens the direness of the situation.  The vast majority of the film is in a seemingly endless underground chamber where unspeakable evils take place daily, and there isn't much time for the lightheartedness that marks the other two films as the good guys' lives (and souls) hang in the balance at every turn.<BR>All that said, this is a hell of a great film.  It is as different from the other two as can be, but for sheer shock and awe, for sheer suspense, it trumps them hands down.  If you want pure adventure, any of the trilogy will do, but this is the best exemplification of it.  Not much else to say, other than get this film as soon as possible and watch it, preferably in a marathon session with the other two (or wait until they come out on DVD, if that EVER happens...).

You wont find hits in this album, only honest and intimate music. I do not like all the songs of the Album, but songs like &quot;What Shall I do&quot;, &quot;testify&quot;, &quot;Saying about you&quot; and so on... make it an Over the top album.

If that list of names right there alone left you speechless wait until you actually see the movie. 'Heat' is about a hard working cop who loves his job as much as his family if not more sometimes (unfortunately) who is chasing down L.A.'s finest criminal's which are of course Kilmer, Voight, Sizemore, and most importantly De Niro who is of course the leader of the pack. In this high tension action-thriller it is different then most others because of cops sitting it vans eating donuts or etc. (as they try in the beginning) Pacino actually publically meets De Niro and sits down for dinner with him at a city restauraunt and discuss how similarly different there lives are and how one of them in the end will have to kill the other in order for two things to happen. Number one De Niro says he never is going back to prison again and Pacino would have to kill him in order to stop him. Number two De Niro would either have to \\"A\\" retire or \\"B\\" kill Pacino in order for him to stop hunting him down. TO BE CONTINUED...
B00001IVOF|5.0|I'd like to start out by saying this album is a must have to those who even heard the term hiphop. Released in 1996 when hiphop was on top. This album portrays street life to the fullest. A year prior in 1995 they released \\"The Infamous\\" which is a classic but not as good as \\"Hell on Earth.\\" \\"Hell on Earth\\" has all the ingredients of a classic album. It has some of the dopest beats ever provided by Havoc, and rugged lyrics that match perfectly. My favorite track, \\"Drop a Gem on 'Em\\" which disses 2 Pac. My favorite line on that track, Prodigy says \\"Think fast or get reminded of robberies in Manhatten, u know what happened, 60 G's worth of gun clappin.\\" That track alone make's this album a classic. There's 14 tracks of pure spitting by Havoc & Prodigy. There are also many great guest appearances. Just because of this album Mobb Deep's one of my favorite hiphop acts ever. If only they released more albums like this than the whole hiphop community would praise them as the best ever to touch a mic. You cannot have a hiphop collection and not have this album. I can easily call this my top 25 hiphop albums of all time. However, if you never heard a hiphop album before, you will be lost by the slang and street rhymes. The rhymes are complex and may be too real for your ears to hear. PEACE.

1573229725|5.0|\\"Fingersmith\\" is the first Sarah Water's book I've delved into, partly because I've been scarred by terrible Victorian fiction in the past, and partly because I was afraid how her novel's would treat their overtly lesbian material. I was overjoyed to find it subtle and touching, without any signs of being tainted by public perceptions of lesbian relationships.<br /> \\"Fingersmith\\" is a multitude of things. It is a mystery, a thriller, a horror and a love story. It is also a superbly detailed and well crafted historical novel. I'm gushing I know, but the truth is that I couldn't put it down.<br />  The story is that of Sue and Maud, the love they bear one another and the tangled web that lies, deceit and family machinations weave around them. Add some intriguing plot elements (a bibliography of indecent literature and a madhouse) and stir with a truly delicious, but layered, villain, and \\"Fingersmith\\" comes out ripe and lush. There are some ingenius twists and turns, and true gut clenching moments when disbelief mingles with pure enjoyment.<br />  I'll step back a moment to attempt an objective evaluation of the craft and style. Sarah Waters does not write in the slickest of prose, and many people may feel compelled to turn back after the first chapter. It is true that the first person narrative lends itself to a disjointed and clumsy beginning, but it won't take long for your palette to adjust. For those coming to the novel fresh from forays into other Booker material (and particularly this year's winner \\"The Life of Pi\\"), the dichotomy will seem clear and apparent.<br />Miss Waters is the author of plot driven novels, she is not a post-modern contemporary author driven by allegory and oxymoron similes. She follows hard on the footsteps of Dickens (although far more compelling) and inherits the voice of an Elizabeth Gaskell modernised for the 21st century. Don't allow this relative simplicity of style to put you off, the effect if by no means shallow or transparent.I promise you a truly gripping read if you perservere - the kind you remember from childhood when books were about turning the page and staying up all night to reach the end, not churning over the existentialist questions of existence.
B000055ZB8|5.0|I've seen this film a number of times on the big screen but not on VHS or DVD, so can't comment on the quality of any of these \\"at-home\\" releases, although I'm familiar with the very fine work done by Kino in restoring and releasing classsic films, and so will purchase theirs when I finally do buy (a class act all the way, they and Criterion are the way to go if you can spend more on your collection). This is a great film, and there's little I can add to the other reviews posted.    However, I should point out to some previous reviewers--as well as for the benefit of future viewers/purchasers--that the tinting of certain scenes is NOT a gimmick devised by contemporary video producers.  To the best of my knowledge, this film was, if not initially then very soon afterward, released with specific scenes tinted in order to lend atmosphere (I not only remember reading this, but have yet to view an untinted print). Tinting of negatives, while not the rule of thumb, was not an uncommon practice during the early days of motion pictures; Lon Chaney's Phantom of the Opera is a case in point (although some of its color segments were early Technicolor), and I believe Griffith's Broken Blossoms also has tinted scenes. As a matter of fact, Turner Classic Movies occasionally runs a lovely montage of the first 100 years of film that opens and closes with hand-tinted silent footage. So rest assured that if the Nosferatu you purchase is tinted, you're seeing what Murnau intended you to see, although I can't guarantee that the tints you'll see are the \\"correct\\" ones (depending on whose release you purchase). Regardless, I can't imagine anyone's not enjoying this film--it's a must-see!  Incidentally and for what it's worth, I also love Herzog's remake--comparing the two represents a delightful use of viewing time.

B00002E233|4.0|About a half-hour into watching \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" I gave up on asking myself what the hell the people who made this movie were thinking.  Then there is a scene where Russell Franklin (Samuel L. Jackson), who once survived an avalanche, gives an inspiration speech to everybody still alive at that point in the movie.  His words are punctuated in such a way that I knew we were not in Kansas any more and decided not to question anything that happened in the rest of the film.  This proved to be a wise decision because what director Renny Harlin has created here is not so much a movie as an amusement park ride.<br />The explanation for what Harlin was thinking is provided on the special features, where it becomes clear the director wanted to make a movie where he could use modern animatronics and computer generated effects to show graphic shark attacks.  The idea was to play with bigger and better toys than Steven Spielberg had when he made \\"Jaws.\\"  Of course, doing so sacrifices the cinematic artistry of Spielberg's film, but that is fine because Harlin is not playing in that ballpark.<br />There is a plot to the film.  Scientist Susan McAlester (Saffron Burrows) has come up with a way of using the brain tissue of sharks to concoct a way of fighting Alzheimer's disease.  The research is underwritten by Franklin's corporation at a giant deep-sea research station, where we have a shark wrangler (Thomas Jane), a cook who is a self-styled preacher (LL Cool J), and an assortment of entree items in the form of Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard, Aida Turturro, and Jacqueline McKenzie.<br />But all that matters is that McAlester is playing Dr. Frankenstein and in making the brains of these sharks bigger, she has also made them smarter.  Her motives for doing so are quickly forgotten because these super smart sharks want to kill every human being in the station and that is what this movie is about.  I bet you can guess who is actually going to survive the slaughter, but that does not detract from the enjoyment of the film either because the fun with \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is enjoying, if that would be the proper world, the way in which the sharks put the bite on the humans.<br />So, if you know going into this movie that it is about a bunch of super intelligent mako sharks eating a bunch of human beings, then you can dismiss all of the scientific explanations and exposition as just prologue.  You do not have to understand it and you can probably get away with even paying attention to it, because once the shark attacks begin that is all that is going to matter with this film.  This is not the thinking person's shark attack film.does not detract from the enjoyment of the film either because the fun with \\"Deep Blue Sea\\" is enjoying, if that would be the proper world, the way in which the sharks put the bite on the humans.  <br />So, if you know going into this movie that it is about a bunch of super intelligent mako sharks eating a bunch of human beings, then you can dismiss all of the scientific explanations and exposition as just prologue.

B00005JKPF|4.0|I must admit, upon first seeing the movie - I was as impressed as everyone seemed to be with it. I was expecting something different in terms of story and direction with this film. It fell short for my excitement.<br />Then I saw it a second time - I loved it. The second time I got passed the lack of original story and started to see the process of the characters coming through. Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects, X-Men) tried to include lots of visuals and actions. Creating villains and believable situations that move the movie along. The effects and action sequences were brilliant.<br />The standout performances included first and foremost Alan Cuming (Annie, Flintstones Viva Rock Vegas) as Night Crawler. His performance was simple and believable. He had heart and compassion and the most incredible mutant ability to date - teleportation. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Roller Ball, Fem Fatalle) as Mystique and Famke Janssen (I Spy, Don't Say A Word) as Jean Grey both had significantly larger parts in this film and were great fun to watch. Also Halle Berry (Die Another Day, Monsters Ball) had some incredible scenes of her weather abilities. Hugh Jackman (Kate and Leopold, Oklahoma) as Wolverine was astonishingly real and motivated for this movie. Sir Ian McKellon (Lord Of The Rings, David Copperfield) was extremely devious as Magneto and the best villain to watch. He seemed to be having a lot of fun with this one.<br />The parts of Patrick Stewart (Star Trek, Animal Farm, Prince Of Egypt) as Charles Xavier and James Marsden (Alley McBeal, Disturbing Behavior) as Cyclops were very small and really the only week points in the story. The president was week and the whole underling White House connection was poor.<br />The story was simple - Humans Vs. Mutants. One man, a scientist was planning on killing all Mutants....one Mutant was planning on killing all Humans. Wow! I liked the concept, but there is definitely more action then story in this one. 5-19-03

But in the end, all that matters is the story, and whether the people who are behind the movie felt so strong about the story that they'd put their heart and soul in it.<br />Watching this movie is almost like reading an ametuer's personal story. The memory and the emotion are so overwhelming that even they choose the most understated words, the feelings are still pouring out from between the lines.
0688163173|3.0|Following Mystic River is certainly a difficult task and Lehane chose to write a completetly different type of novel for his follow-up.  Shutter Island is a phsycological thriller set over four days and with a minimum amount of characters.  Where Mystic River had a ride, rambling scope, Shutter Island focuses on US Marshall Teddy Daniels and his investigation of the mental health facility at shutter island.<br />I know if I had spent more time reading each and every word Lehane wrote, I might have figured out the ending, but Shutter Island is too quick of a read to spend too much time on.  Still, looking back, I can see how well Lehane devised the story and all of the action leads to the ending we get.<br />Lehane hopefully has a long career ahead of him.  I like is mugshot in the back of the hardcover.  It looks to me like Lehane knows that he has it made writing books for a living and getting paid to do what he enjoys.<br />This is a good book and I recommend it.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album isn't just a bunch of songs slapped on a CD and packaged. This album is an autobiography. It is arranged in chronological order, from revoltingly impressionable minds to the painful, depressing realization that he is the man that everyone fears. Every song on here is important, whether or not you understand it or even like it. It illustrates the &quot;deformation&quot; from the Worm to the Antichrist Superstar to the Man That You Fear. &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; is my favorite Antichrist album. It is completely and perfectly provacative, fueled by anger, nihilism, and frustration, and, of course, his fantastically grostesque cynicism. <br />So in other words, this album is SO NEAT!
0553213105|4.0|In Jane Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet realize their own pride and prejudice through dramatic twists and turns of one of the 19th century's greatest novels.  The Bennet family women, destined for poverty, vie for the attention of men belonging to a higher social status.  Due to the mother's greedy nature, the affections of these men have been turned away.  However Jane, the oldest daughter, finds the affection of one man, Mr. Bingley, only to lose him when he is convinced by his good friend Mr. Darcy that she does not love him.  In an attempt to reclaim Mr. Bingley's affection, Jane moves to London to be nearer to him.  In the midst of this drama, Lizzie finds herself smitten by an Officer whose negative opinion of Mr. Darcy influences her greatly.  Because of this, the resentment that Elizabeth harbored towards Mr. Darcy from moment she met him is magnified.  Lydia, one of Elizabeth's younger sisters, fails to act in a socially acceptable manner involving the Officer with whom Elizabeth was smitten.  This behavior leaves the family vulnerable to public disgrace.  Through this course of events, Elizabeth discovers the Officer's malicious nature, and her opinion of Mr. Darcy begins to change.  Will the Bennett family women attain their much longed for higher social status or will they experience the repercussions of Lydia's careless decisions? Is the prideful demeanor that Mr. Darcy displays an indication of his true character?  Has Elizabeth's prejudice obstructed her chance for true romance?
0060987464|5.0|This book is fabulous. Revolting, heart-wrenching, sadistic, hilarious, and bittersweet. Even if you hate Marilyn Manson's music, you'll love this book. Unless, of course, you are a person who looks only skin deep. Or someone with a weak stomach - this man has been through a lot. But every disgusting aspect of his life has come to play a role in the person that he has become, his insight on mankind and also himself, his proof that he is, in fact, human, and an intelligent one at that. It's time we need some rockstars like Mr. Manson who will admit that they are human, admit that they screw up, and to actually admit [instead of constantly prove] that they have human factors such as being self centered, ignorant, arrogant, greedy, addicted, etc.<br />Manson is daring the reader to take chances, make mistakes, and learn from their OWN experience - not anyone else's. To question their own self, their own morality, and grow from it.
0898159156|5.0|If you've ever bought a venus fly-trap and had it die on you, but would still like to give it another try, this is the perfect book.  And not just for fly-traps, but nearly every other carnivorous plant out there!<br />This book is packed full of information on all kinds of plants that trap and eat insects.  But best of all, Peter D'Amato, who runs the largest retail store selling such plants, gives helpful advice on how to grow them.  Pretty much everything from soil mixes to light and humidity levels is detailed out here.  He even gives lists of plants that do well in different settings, such as windowsills, terrariums, and outdoor bogs.  And the writing style is such that it is easy to understand and follow, and even has a nice sense of humor.  And while the author's experience is growing them on the Pacific Coast, the advice is easily adaptable to other climates with some adjustment.<br />This is a must-have book for anyone interested in carnivorous plants - and the \\"bible\\" for anyone who hopes to grow them successfully.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|Hard to imagine that Fritz Lang's extraordinary silent epic was a box-office flop when first released - and almost bankrupted its financiers, UFA (Germany's largest film production company).<br />Set around the year 2000 (though still remaining visionary), the sci-fi film employed a staggering cast of 37,383 and used creative, cutting-edge effects to tell the story of the city of Metropolis (originally inspired by the Manhattan skyline). Here, Utopia (filled with `thinkers') is supported by the underground (filled with `workers'). All is running smoothly until the workers - spurred on by an evil robot replica of their leader Maria - decide to revolt...<br />Approximately two hours long, the film is set to its original score (composed by Gottfried Huppertz), and this DVD edition has been painstakingly restored and digitally remastered to make it the closest version yet to the director's original cut. Bonus features include a nine-minute piece The Restoration on how various copies of the original film were gathered from around the world and restored to create this edition. It also includes The Metropolis Case, a fascinating 44-minute documentary on its making, that also puts it into a historical context.<br />Included is how Lang's overtly anti-Nazi film The Testament of Dr Mabuse (1933) had been banned by Joseph Goebbels yet he was later asked to direct propaganda films for Adolf Hitler. Lang explains in an interview how, when he was approached, left Germany the same day...
0802130208|3.0|A Confederacy of Dunces, written by John Kennedy Toole is the only published work he created in his life. Unfortunately Toole did not live to see his work released or win a Pulitzer Prize.  Toole writes a story which takes place in New Orleans during the nineteen sixties; the main character is an incompetent man named Ignatius Reilly. Ignatius is an unemployed man in his thirties who has a college education and due to a severe lack of motivation and extreme laziness he still lives with his mother who collects welfare checks. Eventually Ignatius strings together some small low paying jobs, which includes a janitor at a pants factory and a hot dog vendor. Ignatius never blames himself for his problems; he always looks at other people's problems to feel better about himself. Ignatius ends up in a tailspin of misery, embarrassment, and failure while he angers his mother and worsens his mental condition. Toole's humorous novel is full of laughs and surprises; it tells the on-going story about man's struggle with life.
B00006690G|5.0|This is Eminems best yet. Yes, he does cuss but big deal, so do most people. This a a really good CD. Great beats and rhythems. Some of the lyrics are a bit \\"out there\\" but if you really listen to what he is saying, it sounds like his life was really \\"out there\\" too. Get this album, its outstanding!
0312265859|2.0|I have to say first, that I loved the first 7 books. They were hilarious and had a heroine that was gutsy and believeable which made me really look forward to Hard Eight.<BR>Boy, I was disappointed...what happened? Stephanie does get her man, but not through her own resourcefulness or guts. In One for the Money, she seemed more assured, more gutsy, more...something! In this outing, she has her mom, her sister, Ranger, Morelli (although, can't be sure, he's in the book so little) running over rabbits, and tracking her man down for her... There are some funny moments, but they seem like the same moments from before....and don't get me started on the 10 line paragraph/resolution of Steph with Ranger, the hottest flirting I've ever read anywhere, and then....what happened?<BR>Overall, I would have to say, that I would prefer not to have a little book out, like the christmas novella every six months, and have Janet work on her next book all year round, it just seems that she can turn out a better book if that's the only one that she's working on.
B00008PRR9|5.0|This album is, I would contend, much overlooked in the Who's catalogue. Yet, 37 years on, there is a freshness and energy which many of their later albums lack. Who fans will be familiar with all the tracks on the CD but the question is do the remixes work? I say the amswer is an emphatic YES. Most tracks are in crisp, clear stereo for the first time. The original mono vinyl album always sounded a bit &quot;muddy&quot; to me, though no worse than many others from the mid 60s. The title track, in particular, sounds much better in its stereo mix. It is a pity, though, that Polydor couldn't squeeze the single mix of &quot;Happy Jack&quot; onto the CD as well as the mono acoustic version which is an interesting curio rather than an essential. My favourite track is &quot;Disguises&quot;, originally from the &quot;Ready Steady Who&quot; EP...but, again, where is &quot;Circles&quot;? This is the Who striding confidently along the highway that led to international acclaim...it's a great album to have in your collection.
0452273331|5.0|It's easy to lose sight of why we read fiction. When you're young and full of hope-for whatever it is that you will want out of life-or if you're older but still hanging on to that youthful optimism some of us once had, The Fountainhead may be just the book for you. It's a little dated now; no one is that certain anymore-as was the author, and her main character, Howard Roark. But if we could, many of us would still like to be like him, or at least we would like to try.<br />This is a novel about Rand's ideal man, (and some other characters who are almost, but not quite, ideal, and some who are bad). She paints a portrait of what he must look like, and you the reader will see it very clearly. You may hate him, or love him, or simply &quot;shrug.&quot; But you will get to know him; he will live for you. What you decide, Rand says, will be a judgment of you, and to this I agree. It will tell what kind of person you are. Rand's portrait of Roark is like Michelangelo's sculptures and painting. It's that good.<br />That doesn't mean that a rational adult has to agree with every word of this novel-or with Rand's Philosophy in toto. This book, like every great work of art, has to be judged as a whole. This is Rand's best. Even if you end up coming down against her philosophy in its main points, you can still love this book.<br />In a nutshell-it's about &quot;the best within us.&quot;
B00000K413|4.0|Am I hallucinating, or are the tracks a bit sped up from the unremastered version? The production is a bit crisper, but the speed thing makes me wanna buy back my original. Anyone know where I can find out? Two listenings haven't changed my mind... Also, they need to put that picture of the boy on the inside and bring back the shot of Roland and Curt by the water, which graced the cover of the 1983 tape and vinyl, and which is now relegated to a B&W insert.

0393057658|5.0|I can't help it. This is Lewis' best since Liar's Poker, even better than The New New Thing, and only behind Liar's Poker because you've read him before. You can look a long time for another book that teaches so much and makes it so much fun.<br />I see a lot of good reviews by baseball fans, and the book deserves them. But I'm in finance. This book will teach you more useful finance than most textbooks. All you have to do is imagine a board of directors instead of the tobacco-chewing scouts; or a bunch of fund managers, traders and analysts instead of first basemen and catchers and you'll see the same basic truths about statistics and human nature apply.

B00000AF98|3.0|When I first reviewed this album in 2003, I basically tore it apart. But you know what? This album has grown on me over the years even if it isn't one of their best. Yes, the keyboards and Ron Nevison production scream 1987. However, the songs here are mostly decent and I find myself reciting most of the lyrics when I hear them now. As before, I still believe that \\"Reason To Live\\" is the best song here and should have been a huge hit. This was one of seven tracks penned by Paul Stanley and he certainly has better songs here than Gene Simmons does. \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\" is another strong track and one of many to feature a great solo from Bruce Kulick. \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\" and \\"Turn On The Night\\" would also be singles and they're decent pop songs. \\"My Way\\", despite its heavy emphasis on keyboards, is also a very good song. As for Gene's songs, none of them are great but they're not terrible either. \\"Hell or High Water\\" and \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" are good pop/rock songs even if the lyrics scream cheese. \\"No, No, No\\" starts with a killer Bruce solo and would have benefited from a less glossy production while \\"Thief In The Night\\" is okay. Still not into \\"Bang Bang You\\" and \\"When Your Walls Come Down\\" but oh well. All told, this isn't classic Kiss but the songs aren't bad and I'd put it over Unmasked and Asylum and put it alongside Hot In The Shade in the 3 star category.
B0000636UN|4.0|This cd is not my all time favorite, but it's very good. Sheryl Crow, changed her look for this album, and it was a smart move. It allowed her to gain new fans, and to keep her music fresh. Although, I don't listen to every track, everytime I listen to this cd, there are some really good ones.<BR>My favorites -<br />&quot;Steven McQueen&quot; - The lryics are not the best for this song, but it's got a good beat, that makes it very catchy.<br />&quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; - A great tune for the upcoming summer. It will be playing all over the place, like last year. This too, is catchy.<br />&quot;You're an Original&quot; Another favorite. The chorus is great.<br />&quot;Safe and sound&quot; I love the chorus, it's my favorite part of the song.<br />&quot;It's so Easy&quot; It's so easy to like this song.<br />Those are some of my favorites. Although some of the tracks, are fillers. It's still a great buy. And even the filler tracks are pretty good. I don't know if this is Sheryl's best, but it's definitly close.
B000002H97|5.0|OK, although I personally think that 'The Black Album' is NOT the best work Metallica has released, I must say that no matter what anyone says, this is the album that Metallica will be remembered for. Why? It was a GIGANTIC hit. EVERYONE has heard 'Enter Sandman' and 'Nothing Else Matters'. This is the one that made Metallica the biggest rock band in the world. And here's what I think of the tracks, one by one:<BR>(rated from * to *****)<br />Enter Sandman: A classic. Creeping intro builds into a hammering song, with one of the best riffs in rock EVER. Lars' drumming is great, James and Kirk do their finest on the axes, and Jason does what he does best: kicks the s**t out of the listener! A perfect live track, too. *****<br />Sad But True: Mega-heavy. Shows that to be heavy you don't need to be fast. Lars pounds his drums like a ten ton hammer. Lyrics are awesome, guitars rock, and, once again, Jason's bassing is phenomenal. *****<br />Holier Than Thou: Fast, heavy, but not as good as the first ones. This one has good-enough lyrics, the riffs are OK, bass lines float nicely, but Lars' drumming is somewhat repetitive and dull. Still, a good ***½ rating.<br />The Unforgiven: The first time you hear the beginning of this song, you might think: \\"F**k, Metallica's gone mellow.\\" But as soon as the intro ends and the song REALLY starts, you realize that Metallica really knows how to make a heavy ballad. Here it is. Drums are heavy as anything, guitars sound fantastic, especially Kirk's solo... Good gawd. Jason's bass is really beautiful. ****½<br />Wherever I May Roam: SWEET. JESUS. How heavy can you get? This one is... beyond words. The sitar intro is by far the greatest intro in all of rock music. The song itself... PURE PERFECTION. The verses are nice and slow, but still heavy, and the chorus is a bit faster, a true KILLER. Lyrics RULE, guitars RULE, bass RULES, drums RULE. This is the one that really stands out on this record. This song heard live: BETTER THAN SEX. *****<br />Don't Tread On Me: Another near-flawless track. Reminds me of some army-style march music. Lars rocks the drums like a maniac, guitars roar heavily, bass pounds nicely in the back. Great song, highly underrated. This should've been a single track. ****<br />Through The Never: Perhaps the fastest song on the album. Still, this one doesn't quite do the trick for me... I can't really tell what it is, but something is missing here. This sounds a bit too... happy for Metallica? Kirk's solo is great, though. Not a great song, but OK. ***<br />Nothing Else Matters: Urgh. Almost every time MTV plays a Metallica video, it's Nothing Else Matters. This is a very good song, showing Metallica's capability to extend their musical limits, but overplaying has killed my interest in this one. Still, this is one of the best songs for Metallica to play live. The best moment in my life was at Metallica's concert at the Ruisrock festival in Turku, Finland in 1999, when they played this one. It had rained all gig, and the night was starting to fall, but when the Boyz started playing this one, the rain stopped and a fully lighted passenger ferry just passed the place (the festival was held at seaside), and about 15 000 cigarette lighters went up. It was beautiful. This live experience boosts the rating to ***½.<br />Of Wolf And Man: Ooohhh baby... This is one of the best tracks ever. It must be one of the most H-E-A-V-Y songs ever. The drums... Magnificent. Guitars... Unbelieveable. Bass... Brilliant. Lyrics... Perfect. *****<br />God That Failed: Slow, heavy, kind of reminds me of The Thing That Should Not Be. Lyrics sound like they're truly from the heart, but are quite repetitive. Bass is roaring, but nothing else really shines on this one. Guitars are flavorless, drumming is dull. The \\"betrayal\\" chant at the end is great, though. ***½<br />My Friend Of Misery: Bass intro that promises more than the song itself can deliver. This is, being co-written by Jason, the most bass-ysong on the album. The guitar riffs are OK, so are the solos, but I really dislike the lyrics, especially the \\"happy\\" chorus, which is completely different from the rest of the song. Lars' drumming sounds like the work of a machine, not nice at all. Jason's bass saves this one from being a DUD. ***<br />Struggle Within: Drumroll at the beginning is fantastic! Intro shoots into the fast 1st verse, which KICKS A**! Chorus parts are not-so-good. Otherwise this is a great ending for the album. And what kind of ending: roaring guitars and raging drums rock, and the just... STOP. ****
B00004Z459|5.0|Let's face it: The bigger a band gets, the bigger the backlash gets. We've seen it happen to Creed, Limp Bizkit, and Matchbox 20, to name just a few. Metalheads and die-hard rock fans shun Linkin Park, and pretty much anything \\"nu-metal\\" for that matter.<br />But forget that it's \\"cool\\" to hate Linkin Park. Let's listen to the music.<br />01. Papercut - Strong opener, but gets old fast. One of the more rap-savvy tracks. 8/10<BR>02. One Step Closer - Who doesn't feel like screaming \\"shut up!\\" at the top of their lungs once in awhile? Unfortunate for those of us living in suburbia, we can't do that. So just turn this up loudddd....8/10<BR>03. With You - Emotional track. Chester Bennington pushes the vocals to the limit. Awesome lyrics. 8/10<BR>04. Points of Authority - One of my favorites, punk attitude (forfeit the game/before someone else takes you outta the frame) and bitter hurt (you love the things/I say I'll do/the way I'll hurt myself again just to get back at you). Good workout song. 9/10<BR>05. Crawling - This song jumps back and fourth between slow verses and a fast, aggressive chorus. Very dark. 10/10<BR>06. Runaway - My least favorite song on the album. The verses are great, but it falls apart at the chorus (which happened to be an inspiration for OSC). 5/10<BR>07. By Myself - One of the best. Amazing vocals. Verses plagued with questions everyone asks. The best part is the bridge. 10/10<BR>08. In The End - Who HASN'T heard this song? LP's mainstream success. The classic bad relationship song. 9/10<BR>09. A Place For My Head - Creative verses with great rapping, but the chorus is a bit disorganized. 7/10<BR>10. Forgotten - Fast and aggressive Paints a clear picture in your head. Beautiful lyrics. 9/10<BR>11. Cure For The Itch - When you have an itch, you scratch. And that's what this track is about: DJ Joe Hahn has fun with scratching and samples. Fun, but doesn't fit the rest too well. 7/10<BR>12. Pushing Me Away - An epic song, with killer vocals. 9/10<br />Overall: Even the haters can't deny Chester Bennington's talent. If you like darker rap-rock, give it a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed. I don't hand out five start ratings to CDs often, but this one deserves it.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I am a recent convert.  For years, I'll admit, I thought Fleetwood Mac were dirty words.  Recently I've have warmed up to the fact that they made some of the best tunes in rock history and that Stevie Nicks is the queen and Buckingham is a genius songwriter.  I bought 'Say You Will' reluctantly--being a college student, i found it apalling that i couldn't see them in concert for under 50 dollars(most tickets 100 dollars or more).  When rock becomes income specific, it loses some of it's appeal for me but the record is truly fantastic.  Like many records with 19 songs, a few could stand to go.  But for the most part, this is just fantastic stuff.  The political overtones are well spoken, especially on Buckingham's ode to the anti-McCarthyist journalist, Ed Murrow.  Such sentiments lead me to believe that 'Peacekeeper' is fairly sarcastic which gives a dark edge to it's smooth exterior.  But lyrics aside, the songs are extremely strong.  The performances are outstanding--especially the vocal arrangements.  Each song has a character and a dimension that makes it memorable.  Cheers to the new Mac.  Maybe not the same as the old Mac, but this is no 'Hell Freezes Over'.  No, this is proof that years after a classic bands' supposed prime, they can get back together and make viable, great music that stands up to the best of their former glory days.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Heavy guitars, white-boy rapping and lots of melodies and screaming: Yep, Linkin Park is back. The mainstream rap-rock band everyone loves to hate. Go to a rock message board and mention Linkin Park, and there will be a chorus of \\"They're pathetic.\\" Okay, that all sounded negative. And this isn't a negative review. Really.<br />Overall, Meteora is a solid sophomore album. It certainly isn't as good as Hybrid Theory, but few albums are.<BR>I'm not usually too nit-picky, but Linkin Park could have done better. Being a devoted LP fan, I've heard B-sides and EP songs. I know what they can do.<BR>For one thing, the song layout needs to vary a bit. And the band definitely should have taken more risks. A couple of songs should be longer....Bringing us onto another topic: The length. People moan and complain that this album is only 37 minutes long. I would rather have just 37 enjoyable minutes then 20 extra minutes of junk.<br />I'll break it down...<BR>01. Intro - 13 second intro, should have been part of the first song. (no rating)<BR>02. Don't Stay - Nice aggressive break up song. I love the verses, the chorus sounds too much like Hybrid Theory's \\"One Step Closer.\\" 7/10<BR>03. Somewhere I Belong - Horrible, horrible choice for the first single. This song is way to simple and soft to represent the rest of the album--but putting all that aside, it really isn't a bad track. Just too generic. 6/10<BR>04. Lying From You - Killer vocals on the chorus. Gets old fast though. Lyrics are a bit boring as well. 7/10<BR>05. Hit The Floor - One of my favorites--catchy rhymes and a killer screaming chorus (One minute your on top/the next your not/missed your shot). Signature LP sound with extra flavor. 9/10<BR>06. Easier To Run - People bash this song because the layout is similar to HT's \\"Crawling\\"....But that's where the similarities end. The verses are a little cliche,' but the chorus is beautiful. I love how Chester does back up vocals for Mike's rapping. 8/10<BR>07. Faint - Catchyrapping, but I don't like the chorus. 6/10<BR>08. Figure.09 - Anyone remember the old EP song \\"Part of Me?\\" Well this track is like \\"Part Of Me pt. 2.\\" Not so much in song layout, but the lyrics are quite similar. The bridge is also like the \\"By Myself\\" bridge. Not a bad song, but very unoriginal. \\"Part Of Me\\" and \\"By Myself\\" both outdo it. 6/10<BR>09. Breaking The Habit - The only song without a trace of the \\"signature LP sound.\\" But that's not a bad thing--BTH breaks walls and boundaries. Lyrics are meaningful, with little bits that any teen can relate too. The vocals are amazing. BTH is one of the best songs I've ever heard. Should have been longer. 10/10<BR>10. From The Inside - Cool chorus, but the verses could do for some improvement. \\"I don't know who to trust/no surprise\\" is kind of cliche. I like how they mix up the rapping and singing though. And the screaming rocks. 8/10<BR>11. Nobody's Listening - A hip-hop driven track. Despite a few slightly cliche' lyrics (I got a heart full of pain/head full of stress), this song is awesome--the flute gives it a great flavor, and Chester sounds taunting in the chorus (tried to give you warning/but everyone ignores me/told you everything loud and clear/but nobody's listening). 9/10<BR>12. Session - Doesn't have Joe's humor of \\"Cure For The Itch\\" but still a cool instrumental. 7/10<BR>13. Numb - Similar to \\"Pushing Me Away\\" but in no way a copycat of any kind. A very epic song. One of the best LP songs. Should have been longer. 10/10<br />Overall: Definitely worth your [money], but I hope for a better third album. If you liked Hybrid Theory, there's a good chance you'll like this as well.
0385504209|5.0|I dont like thrillers. I avoid them on the bookshelves. However, I bought this because of the subject matter. Da Vinci intrigues me and this book tied together all the loose theories about his sexuality, the Mona Lisas' smile and the hidden meaning in his Last Supper. This would have been enough, and all that I expected from this book but Brown doesn't stop there. Not only are Da Vincis' secrets  revealed but material that heretofore has only been available in obscure out-of-print books.<br />I loved the lecture-like documentary sections on symbolism and the distortion of history. This is the stuff I wish I had been taught in history class. The truth! The only thing that would have made this book better(for me) would have been the omission of the thriller genre and had it been written as non-fiction. As it is, I still recommend it highly!<br />Its interesting that the protagonists' dilemna is whether or not the world should be privy to these earth shattering secrets while Brown gives it to the reader and thus the world in a form that makes it dismissive. Yet,on the other hand,it probably sells better as a novel,(thus disseminating the info to a wider audience) and also, cushioning the secrets in this genre may ease the pain for those offended at the thought of the existence of pre-christian spirituality and its distressful demise and cover up.It does turn everything upside down doesnt it?
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a very good CD! Evanescence's style is very good in my opinion. Some of the songs are a bit repetitve, though.  Personally, I like Bring me to life, but all the others are very good. If you have ever seen the anime cartoon Inuyasha, this music can relate to Inuyasha, Kagome, and Kikyo. Enjoy!
0802130208|4.0|Bombarded with the cretins and sheer foolishness, Ignatius J. Reilly stumbles through life leaving an unrecognizable trail of folly.  A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy Toole, is the story of Ignatius J. Reilly.  His trials and tribulations, as well as comical interactions with individuals provide for an amusing story line.  His escapades lead him to obtain different jobs throughout the story, which is the basis for the majority of his predicaments.  Despite not being the most favorable employee, he is able to find work at a number of different locations.  One job, at a trousers factory, ends up being a monumental mistake in his career.<BR> The author's use of language adds immensely to the wittiness of the story.  Toole injects an immaculate vocabulary into Ignatius, which can be seen in his ability to make fun of situations that occur in his presence.  One experience Ignatius has rather periodically is conversations with a fellow friend, Myrna Minkoff.  They confer through a series of letters, debating on opinions about differing social and political beliefs; \\"Do you seriously think that I am interested in your tawdry encounters with such sub-humans as folksingers?  In every letter of yours I seem to find some references to the sleaziness of your personal life.\\"<BR> Toole adds many characters that add to the effects of Ignatius's absurdity.  From his disbelieving mother to an honest hot dog vendor, Ignatius seems to blight everyone's lives he comes in contact with.  He habitually relates the capricious wavering of events in his life to Fortuna, a sort of good or bad luck decision maker.  This provides many comical encounters within his mind.  Whether it be relating this downward spin of Fortuna to getting fired from one of his jobs, or his constantly deteriorating health, Ignatius transmits these episodes to the world around him, and this is usually rather negative; \\"A firm rule must be imposed upon our nation before it destroys itself.  The United States needs some theology and geometry, some taste and decency.  I suspect that we arte teetering on the edge of abyss.\\"  Upon finishing this book, I have a greater appreciation of the simp0le story.  Toole uses a mastery of language, comic relief, and interesting philosophies in his characters, and they fuse together to make an entertaining narrative.
B00005Q66T|3.0|In the music industry, there are so many artists that have set the boundaries for what music should be like, sound like, and most importantly feel like. In the music industry, there is one a few artists that continue to showcase that feel. Madonna is actually one of them. Since she said that she always wanted to rule the world, she has been able to accomplish that feat. Then again, the music isn't what it was suppose to feel like now, but it sure felt like that back in the 1980's.<br />Madonna's 2001 Greatest Hits GHV2, consists of a lot of Madonna's biggest songs from her career from records like Erotica, the Multi-Grammy winning album Ray Of Light, and Bedtime Stories. The music is still as fresh and as unbelieveable as it was released back then. Though Madonna's music is still innovative, when it comes to Greatest Hits records, they always seem to fall flat on their faces. There are so many dynamic songs like Take A Bow, Ray Of Light, and Music. It is just a shame that there were so many good songs that really were overlooked on this collection, including Bedtime Story, This Used To Be My Playground, I'll Remember, and her cover of Don McLean's American Pie.<br />Although it is a fair Greatest Hits collection, Madonna could've done a little better with her music anthology. I just hope that when she makes another Greatest Hits collection, she'll be able to put all of her smash songs on there, and not just the overlooked compromises.
B000003S2K|5.0|i first was turned on to eno's music via his &quot;apollo&quot; CD which to date is my favorite.  i recently picked up &quot;bang on a can's&quot; version of the ambient 1 CD and was very impressed.<BR>so, when i found myself staring at the orginal i wasn't quite sure how it would measure up.  all i can say is that eno's minimalist approach is genius.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Like another reviewer said, upon first listen, I thought this album was pretty good.  Upon second listen: okay.  Third: poor.<BR>Let's face it, the songs on this album sound very amateur.  Especially the folk songs.  'Ball and a Biscuit' gets much praise but I question how many times does the standard for blues songs have to be done, and redone.  Meg's drumming is horrid.  I will not even mention her singing.  Its as bad as Eddie Van Halen's attempt at singing on VHIII.  They should be ashamed for trying to sell a song with lyrics such as the one on &quot;In the Cold Cold Night&quot;.  Little Acorn is, perhaps, the worst Black Sabbath song ever.  Its as if they said let's spend no time trying to actually write songs - all we need to do is &quot;sound&quot; good (and derivative).  I don't mind derivative if the songs are good (ie Interpol) but this is just ridiculous.  Come on people, you've got to want more from music than this!<br />In other words, this album is tailor made for the MTV crowd.

Ending up in Hawaii, he befriends a little girl named Lilo, who thinks he is a harmless dog. Lilo's sister Nani, who is her guardian since her parents died, is terrified and trying to find a job. Aliens from his home planet are looking for Stitch and he hides as best as he can. Along the way, Stitch, Lilo, and Nani learn the importance of Ohana. Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind...or forgotten. Lilo and Stitch will capture your heart, make you cry and make you laugh.<BR>If you haven't seen it--go buy it and watch it NOW!!!
B00005UWCV|3.0|I have to admit that I have mixed feelings about this film. On one hand, the story line was terrific, even though Rasputin was a bit scary at times. The songs were wonderful, and I especially liked &quot;At the Beginning&quot; (if that's the right name for the title.) The animation was superb, especially in the &quot;Once upon a December&quot; sequence. The characters were believeable and enjoyable, and I liked watching Anya's relationship with Dmitri go from constant bickering to genuine affection. The reunion with her grandmother was touching as well.<BR>However, the historical inaccuracies in this film bothered me, especially since I've read a lot about the real Romanov family and know that their situation was nothing like what's portrayed in the film. I realize that this is a kid's movie, but I think the directors rearranged the facts a bit too much. To begin with, Anastasia was not a child when her family was murdered -- she was 17. The family's massacre took place in Siberia in 1918, not in St. Petersburg in 1916, as the film depicts. And Ansastasia's grandmother lived in Denmark, not Paris. Apparently the prouducers just thought Denmark wasn't impressive enough for a background setting.<BR>Other than the distortion of historical facts, I enjoyed this film. I give it three stars.
B00000IN5G|4.0|Pretty good, some really awesome songs on it but i dont like some of the songs because some of the riffs are the same or very similar. The best songs on the cd are Warheart, Silent Night, Bodom Night, Hatebreeder, Bed Of Razors, and Wrath Within. The other songs are alright just not as good as i thought they would be after listening to Follow The Reaper. Some people like this one better but im just telling it like it is!

0316666343|5.0|I read this book in just a few days.  I couldn't put it down.  I really liked that the book was narrated by the main character who is telling her story from heaven.  Her candor, wit, and sadness come across very well to the reader.  This book should come with a box of kleenex because it is a tear-jerker!  Schmaltzy-ness aside, the story is original and there are passages that really are beautifully written.  The author does wrap things up nicely at the end of this novel, but why not--the story begins tragically and there are a ton of emotions that run through this story.  By the end of the novel, you NEED a happy ending.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I rented this movie with little hope. Although I've enjoyed James Spader in the past (Sex, Lies And Videotape, for instance), this move looked like a crappy erotic N'Synch daydream about \\"Ooh, sexretaries!\\" Ick!<br />However, I was utterly entranced and delighted by this movie. I was so entranced, that I watched it once, and then promptly watched it a second time. James Spader was utterly captivating. He was unbelievably sexy, dark, and oddly sweet. I didn't love Crash but this movie has restored my faith in someone that I have considered to be an excellent actor for many years.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal (who is the main character as Lee) was adorable from the start and watching her growth through the movie is amazing. She starts as a lonely, odd, sweet girl who clearly doesn't have any idea where she fits in the world. As the relationship between Mr. Gray (James) and Lee grows into an incredibly intimate blend of needs (hers and his), Lee begins to become simply and completely self-aware. Although she is the submissive half of the SD couple, you see that she is also, in many ways, the stronger half. She wields an enormous amount of control in her submissive form.<br />I found this move to be oh so sexy, joyous, sweet, and completely bewitching.
0767842693|5.0|I first saw The Last Picture Show in the early 1970's - I was still in high school at the time.  It was the kind of movie that left me a bit unsettled and a little confused, but kept me wondering and thinking about it.  I recently decided to get the movie and watch it for a second time, some thirty-one years later.<br />There were some scenes and dialog that I remembered quite well, and some of the same feelings that I experienced during my first viewing reemerged as I watched once again.  I was, however, able to capture some fresh insights and perspectives on the movie during my second viewing - perhaps because there were scenes that I had forgotten about, or maybe because I have thirty additional years of life experience with which to make sense out of it this time.<br />Although the movie appears to primarily focus on what it was like to \\"come of age\\" or transition to adulthood in the early 1950's in a small Texas town, I think that it actually uses this backdrop to explore some of life's lessons: making choices about what people think they want or need, experiencing the consequences that ensue from these choices, and how people cope with these consequences.  <br />The story places at its hub three high school students finishing their senior year and then going forward into young adulthood.  It is essentially composed of vignettes with interactions that they have amongst themselves, their parents and adult acquaintances, and their peers, while the setting of the small town and life in the early 50's serves as the underlying connectedness to each of them.<br />As the young adults explore the dilemmas and emotional ups and downs of making their first \\"grown-up\\" decisions, an interesting contrast becomes apparent with the older adults of the town, many of whom are still coming to grips with the decisions and experiences that they had when they were young adults.<br />It seems to me that the story shows, first hand, in brutally honest and graphic ways, how learning to make your way in life and get along with others is truly a life-long process, and how trust and friendship can provide a much-needed safety net as part of this process.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I get tired of hearing about so called soulful rock singers.  The ones with voices that are supposed to move you like B Holiday, N Simone, etc. or so the critics say.  Well I often end up with sugar pop girl albums I return or just never play.  When I buy a grown woman's CD I want to her a real woman's voice, OK?  Not some little whiney chick.  <br />SO if you like that sugary pop stuff. Don't buy this CD.  Cause Ms Harvey can SS-sing.  Capital S ok? With Soul capital S again.  Take it from a true soul sista who when she is not listening to Ms Harvey is listening to Sarah V., Billie, Nina et al.  Enjoy.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This 1988 remake is far better than 1958's THE BLOB it features rebel Brian and cheerleader Meg fighting the acid like ooze wiping teens mostly into sex and dirty vagrants.this one has nice sense of comedy,outstanding special effects featuring a man getting plunged down a drain,the sewer part and theater.the gore is plentiful and this one features no nudity or drug use.Rated R for violence and gore and profanity.
B000069AUI|5.0|listening to this album reminded me of the feeling I had as a child when I first heard some of the seminal rock albums of all time(beatles. led zep, etc.) Prior to hearing coldplay I had become so pesimistic about the state of rock.In fact, I have only been listening to old r&amp;b and soul as everything else seemed vapid or dishonest. That is until I heard coldplay. I can't wait for their next album. I am an abashed fan of a rock and roll band again and it feels great. Thanks coldplay!
B00008RH3L|5.0|If I had to make a list of the top 5 movies of all time, &quot;Miller's Crossing&quot; would make the cut. Breathtaking photography, razor-sharp acting ... and, unquestionably, the piercingly brilliant Coen dialogue. Many fine films fade the more times you see them, but MC only gets more dense and heartbreaking. I'm a harsh critic, I don't say this lightly, but ... I love this film.<br />And it's FINALLY arriving on DVD!
B00005JLK1|1.0|Despite a gruesome and creative opening, Ghost Ship fails after the first 10 or 15 minutes. Why? Because it's amazingly predictable and by the numbers horror. All the usual suspects are gathered and dispatched with an alarming paucity of imagination.<br />The plot is pretty simple: In 1963 a luxury ship disappears at sea without a trace. Nearly 40 years later, a salvage crew discovers the boat still on the ocean being carried by the currents. Although there's no one alive on board, there's every sign that someone has been there recently. That's when the scary stuff starts to happen.<br />There's a stellar acting crew aboard the ship. Everyone from Gabriel Bryne to Julianna Margulies gives routine performances. Despite the pedigree of the cast, they are clearly uninspired by the weak material.<br />It's amazing and rather sad that this type of material is produced today. Sadly, the horror films that have come out over the last couple of years (with a few exceptions)demonstrate a real lack of understanding about what makes films both effective and scary. Creating a shock a minute and gruesome make up and visual effects doesn't make a compelling horror film by themselves. It takes a literate, intelligent script with engaging characters. Ghost Ship has neither.<br />Director Steve Beck has demonstrated that he has the skills to do by the numbers films. He's a talented director rudderless in a sea of mediocre material. Without any inspired material, Beck's films just don't work. This is the type of Z movie material that might have made for a good laugh on a Creature Features television series but today it's pretty inexcusible. A pity as there was an interesting idea at the center of Ghost Ship. Unfortunately, like a lot of materail that gets churned out from Hollywood today, this seed never took root.
0743201140|2.0|This is my first time to write a review after buying dozens of books through Amazon. But a contrary opinion is needed here.    The premise was great: working on our strengths is more important than focusing on our weaknesses. The first 2/3 of the book repeated this idea in various ways. That is great, but I already believed that or I would not have purchased the book.     Almost 1/3 was spent explaining how to manage people by understanding the strengths of your employees. A few pages in between explained the profiles that are derived from the online test. These pages are descriptive, but quite general. They sound like horoscopes from the newspaper. But no space was spent on how to apply the descriptions of the strength profiles. And that is what I came expecting to learn.
B000000OA6|5.0|By 1991, Freddie Mercury was close to death. The AIDS related virus that would eventually kill him had well and truly settled in to his body, and he would die in November of that year.<br />It is therefore fitting that the album that closed out his time with Queen - `Innuendo' - was the very best album they'd done since `A Day At The Races'.<br />From the moment you hit play, it is clear that you are in for one hell of a musical ride. The opening track, `Innuendo' itself, is the very best on the album. As Roger thunders out a drum roll, the song begins, and you are immediately somewhere else. `Innuendo' is a six and a half minute long opus that carries you away from whatever it is you are concentrating on. I first heard it on the compilation `Greatest Hits II' and I was so caught up in it that I completely missed the fact that the phone rang out three times. It more than deserved to go into the charts in January '91 at no.1.<br />As the album continues on to track two, you can't help but smile at `I'm Going Slightly Mad', Freddie's last ever single. It's something only he could write, with silly lyrics put to surprisingly serious music. As with `Innuendo' before it, it just carries you away, and when you come back in time for track three, you'll be laughing.<br />Track three is `Headlong', a hard and heavy Brian May inspired rock track. In contrast to the synthesizer filled track that precedes it, `Headlong' is all electric guitars and drums, and it's video clip was Queen's last performance clip. (Excluding `No-one But You', which came out six years later)<br />Finally, we get away from the singles with `I Can't Live With You', a typically classic Queen song, sounding like something out of the `News Of The World/Jazz'<BR>era, and the beautiful `Don't Try So Hard', which is one of Innuendo's finest songs.<br />`Ride The Wild Wind' is vaguely reminiscent of songs like `Hammer To Fall' and `Tie Your Mother Down', with loud guitars and a great drum line - not surprisingas the main writer was drummer Roger Taylor.<br />`All Gods People', a Freddie Mercury/Mike Moran (not a member of Queen) collaboration, is a great track which sees Freddie appeal to humanity in the only way he knew how - through his music.<br />Famous as the last video clip in which Freddie appeared is `These Are The Days Of Our Lives', a beautiful song about reflecting on the past. Truly a peak of the album, it was on top of the charts for longer than all but one other single in 1992 (the other being Bryan Adams `Everything I Do'), which is quite an effort.<br />The album closes with `The Show Must Go On', famous for it's retrospective video clip and eulogy-like quality - the video showed the best of Queen on film through the `80s. From the haunting violin opening through to the continuos echoes of the quartet's vocals, `The Show Must Go On' is one of the greatest songs of the nineties, and was the last single to be released before Freddie's death.<br />Other tracks include `Delilah', `The Hitman' and `Bijou'.<br />All up, `Innuendo' is the very best album by Queen through the `80s and `90s, and should always be remembered as the great, final curtain from Freddie, Brian, Roger and John. Even though `Made In Heaven' came some years later, `Innuendo' was the last album.
B000001EGE|4.0|This is probably one of my favorite Elton John albums. It's fun to listen to, and has a pretty good array of music styles and moods. The country-tinged quality of \\"Honky Cat\\" reminds me of Tumbleweed Connection, and the gospel-like style of \\"Salvation\\" and \\"Slave\\" is enjoyable. I also love the rock 'n roll quality of \\"Susie\\" and \\"Amy\\".<br />When Elton sings \\"Mellow\\", \\"Rocket Man\\", and \\"Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters\\", you can really hear what he's feeling, especially in \\"Mellow\\" and \\"Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters\\". <br />\\"I Think I'm Gonna Kill Myself\\" and \\"Hercules\\" aren't the most poetic songs on here, but they're great fun to listen to.<br />My only complaint about this is the bonus track, a demo version of  \\"Slave\\". It's interesting to hear what the song started out like, but after hearing the finished product, it doesn't measure up particularly well. Aside from that, though, this is a great album, and one I would definitely recommend getting.
B000000OAN|5.0|Any vaguely serious Queen fan will already own this CD, so it's not really for them. This is more for those of you who are yet to discover the magic that is Queen - for Queen are the very best rock band that ever existed.<br />Okay, so that's definitely a matter of opinion. But, this is still a must have CD.<br />The opening song, Death On Two Legs, holds great hints as to what's to come, though I personally wasn't so keen on it. It is followed by great tracks like Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon and I'm In Love With My Car, though, which makes up for it's poor opening.<br />Great tracks on the album include You're My Best Friend and '39, but my personal favourite is Brian May's eight minute epic The Prophet's Song - it's very, very long, but it's brilliant to make up for it. It's actually a bit of a matter of taste, I'll admit, but it's incredibly well written.<br />The album closes out with the simply excellent Bohemian Rhapsody - everyone should've heard this song at least once in their lives, and, while not as good as The Prophet's Song in my opinion, it's still a classic and well deserves it's status as one of the best songs of all time.<br />The proper conclusion to the CD is Brian May's famous rendition of God Save The Queen which he performed at the Queen's Jubilee in 2002.<br />Other tracks include Sweet Lady, Seaside Rendezvous, Love Of My Life and Good Company - all very well written and great songs.<br />There's very little to criticise about this album, except that it seems as if Queen hadn't really learnt how to distinguish an album from a collection of songs. Their next album - A Day At The Races - really hit that part of being a band on the head.<br />Though a little loosely compiled, A Night At The Opera is still a must-have album, and the day I bought it still stands out in my head. Actually closer to 4 ½ stars, but you can't distinguish on Amazon[.com] rating system.
B000001DQI|5.0|Before I became a die-hard Elton John fan a few years ago, I had always heard that this was his best album ever. I didn't pay much attention then, since I wasn't listening to Elton's work much. Now that I have heard it, I agree that it's some of his best work. It's not quite THE best, Tumbleweed Connection takes that honor in my book, but it's definitely way up there, certainly a must-have for any Elton John fan (it's also one of those albums you should get if you're just slightly interested in his work). This album is nothing short of phenomenal, and not just because it's jam-packed with hits.      Bernie's lyrics and Elton's vocals & music are in perfect sync, and the sheer diversity of styles of music is amazing. This album has everything: great pop ballads (\\"Candle In The Wind\\", \\"Harmony\\"), rock (the \\"Love Lies Bleeding\\" half of the opening medley, \\"Bennie & The Jets\\", \\"Dirty Little Girl\\", \\"All the Girls Love Alice\\", \\"Your Sister Can't Twist\\", \\"Grey Seal\\", \\"Saturday Night's Alright\\"), reggae (the enjoyable, amusing \\"Jamaica Jerk-Off\\"), country (\\"Roy Rogers\\" and the very funny \\"Social Disease\\"), and old-fashioned 1930's & 1940's \\"big band\\" and jazz music (\\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" and \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\").    The poetic quality of some of Bernie's lyrics is great, as evidenced in songs like \\"Candle In The Wind\\", the title track, \\"This Song Has No Title\\" (yes, that is really the title), \\"Grey Seal\\", and \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" (the only Elton John album that has more poetic lyrics than this one is Captain Fantastic). This album also has some great \\"story songs\\", those being \\"The Ballad Of Danny Bailey\\", \\"All The Girls Love Alice\\", and to a lesser extent, \\"Candle In The Wind\\".    I could probably write page after page about how great this album is, but since space is limited, suffice it to say that it's absolutely essential for an Elton John collection.
0385504209|2.0|If you're looking for a page turning can't wait to see what happens next beach read, this may be the book for you. The story is of a Harvard symbologist who aids a French cryptologist in uncovering clues her murdered Grandfather has left behind in the works of Leonardo DaVinci.<br />Plot supersedes character development, which seems to work in the first half of the book, but as I got closer towards the end it felt like stock cardboard cut outs delivering rather stilted dialogue. Still, it's an interesting and entertaining premise even if it doesn't always succeed in execution
B000001EG6|5.0|This was the album that really got Elton noticed, and is, without question, one of his very best. It's second only to Tumbleweed Connection (the #1 in my top 10 of Elton's work). Both he and Bernie really showed their potential as artists on this release.<br />There isn't a single song on this album I don't like. All of Bernie's lyrics are excellent, and Elton's interpretations of them, the ballads in particular, are marvelous! His vocals on \\"Your Song\\", \\"I Need You To Turn To\\", \\"Sixty Years On\\", \\"First Episode At Hienton\\", and  \\"The Greatest Discovery\\" can only be described as gorgeous! I was blown away when I first heard these songs! Even though the majority of the tracks are ballads, there are plenty that show Elton can rock just as well. \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\", \\"The Cage\\", and \\"The King Must Die\\" are just a few examples.This album is another must-have for any Elton John collection, it's not one to miss!

B000002H33|5.0|Metallica junkies aleady know of what metal superstars Metallica were in the 80's, and it was \\"Master of Puppets\\" that brought them their first commercial success, their first album to go platnum.  Ant it's not hard to see why:  this album is the musical equivalent of a battering ram.  The incessant crunch of the rhythm section, coupled with the sheer animalistic force of the guitars can save construction companies millions.  Not to mention James Hetfields' threatening bark can make even the most stoic of men soil themselves.  It will also leave you begging for more.<br />It all kicks off with the pummeling \\"Battery,\\" a speedy piece of thrash that combines ultra-quick riffs and a the chorus is a headbangers' dream.  However, the albums' two standout songs are the title track and the semi-ballad \\"Sanitarium.\\"  The title track immediately kicks everything into high gear and it rarely slows down.  The lyrics cover the familiar territory of drug abuse and its power of the one addicted, but Hetfield's  powerful vocal delivery lift them up to a respectable level of allegory while the music threatens the stability of your sound system.  \\"Sanitarium\\" is a brooding, foreboding track that tells the story of an inmate held in an asylum for being mentally disturbed.  The song was a lyrical breakthrough for Hetfield, who simaltaneously paints a dark picture of the inmates inner demons while criticizing the policies and preconcieved notions of the asylum he is kept in. He gives us no relief from either of the dark concepts of the song.  Kill is such a friendly word.<br />Even though \\"Puppets\\" is universally remembered as Metallica's best studio release, it turned out to be bittersweet.  This album would turn out to be Metallica's last with legendary bassist Cliff Burton, who died not long after the release of \\"Puppets.\\"  Burton was instrumental is helping mold Metallica's early success, and to this day is still one of the best bassists to grace the metal world.  Nonetheless, \\"Master of Puppets\\" is still one of the master albums of metal, one that is still a benchmark by which all metal albums are measured by today.
B000056BOR|5.0|If only romance comedies were still this way. Cary Grant and Doris Day are great. Also Gig Young gives this comedy some of the best scenes.
B00008OLYN|5.0|As with any Opeth album it took me a few listens to get into, but once I did it really clicked.  I have to say this, though, if you are a person who liked Opeth because of their growling vocals and crunching riffs in their other albums then this is definately not for you.  This is for the listener who respects Opeth for their musicianship and lyrics and great ability to create entrancing progressive metal.  Standout tracks include: Windowpane, In My Time Of Need, and Closure, but all of the songs are really of equal greatness, they just happen to be my favorite.
B00004X01U|5.0|Though this album is far less intense than her previous award winning Ray of Light, it's new content and catchy rhythms make it just as fun and exciting.  When I first bought it, I didn't think much of it, and I thought it lacked in musical intensity and mature material.  But I've grown to love this album in all it's simple glory.  Obviously with Music, Madonna has tried to make a dance album, plain and simple.  And she has succeded in making something catchy and meaningful.  Ditching William Orbit (major Ray of Light producer) for a less electronica sound, she's come up with more syncopated rhythms and dancable music than ever before.<br />Music, the title track and the dance romp everyone knows, is the opener for this album.  Madonna pulls us in with her sexy and seductive words -- 'hey Mr. DJ, put a record on, I wanna dance with my baby'.  Getting down to the rawness of music, Madonna makes her point loud and clear with nothing more than a simple beat and only a few instruments.  A song with very high club appeal, it's strong and vibalicious.<br />Impressive Instant, the second track, features Madonna warped and morphed to the max.  Her voice is stretched high and low, dense and thin, while accompanied by digitally enhanced sounds.  What else can I say about this song?  It's strange that's for sure, but dancable and catchy.<br />Runaway Lover, one of the few tracks on the album produced by William Orbit, has some winding instruments and more syncopated rhythms.  It also features several different guitar riffs.  <br />I Deserve It, a simple ballad, is melodic and, though not as emotional as previous hits like Frozen, has a genuine honesty that I love.  The featured instrument in this song is the acoustic guitar, which is beautifully played.  <br />Amazing, the fifth song, has an obssesiveness about it that makes you want to play it over and over.  Not surprising since this song is about getting hooked on the wrong man.  It's got some piano pieces in it that make it vulnurable while the beat and bass keep the song strong.<br />Nobody's Perfect, a beautiful song with a once again warped Madonna, is nothing short of perfection, ironically enough.  It reminds me of The Power of Goodbye on her previous album.  It's the strong strings and orchaestral sections in this song that really get my thumbs up.<br />Don't Tell Me, the guitar anthem of the year, is strange but fun.  Do your own thing and have a good time and be confident.  That's this song.  You'll either love it or hate it.  It's cut guitar and tremelo strings make it just as catchy as it is annoying.  But again Madonna has succeded as successfully mixing lyrics and music to create something that sounds awesome. <br />What It Feels Like For A Girl, the eighth track, is a masterpiece.  There's a british woman (unknown if it's Madonna or not) saying some things on stereotyping of women in the beginning, which makes this song a quick hit for women all over the world.  In a way, this song reminds me of Don't Stop from Madonna's Bedtime Stories album.  It must be the beat, because the lyrics certainly don't match.  It also includes some intense strings.<br />Paradise (Not For Me) has a strange quality about it, and is mysterious.  It's syncopation makes it hard to find the beat at first, and the morphed voice of her speaking is captivating.  Also in this song is a verse where she speaks French.  It's quite a long song, but the emotional strings and her sounding like she's nearly crying throughout make it a wonderful piece.  <br />Gone, the last track, seems like an incomplete conclusion to this album, but it fits in some way.  At the very end, we hear Madonna sing one word a cappella -- of course, 'gone'.  It's kind of scary in a way, and you wonder where the rest of the song and/or album are.  But this song is honest and simple, fitting the others well.<br />I missed William Orbit a great deal on this album, though Music has a certain kind of maturity that is very different than Ray of Light.  More easily understood, it would explain it's broader appeal and more chart-topping hits.  An album is good when it gets you into a mood that stays the same from beginning to end, and Music does just that.
0321127420|4.0|This is certainly a very good reading about building enterprise applications. I like that the author gives samples for the most currently used software platforms, such as Java and .NET. Anyway, the author treats more the specifics of Java than those of .NET, and that shows the patterns he discusses don't always have such a general applicability. A certain thing not well covered is related to the table module. I have a compelling question about it and if any readers of the book are willing to help me with that, please let me know. I suppose questions aren't to be posted in a book review.<BR>To conclude, I liked reading the book and I'm sure it's worth the money.

B00005JKPF|5.0|This is most certainly one of the better adaptations of a comic book (or TV series) to the big screen I have seen on quite some time.   Although it departs from the comic series in some very apparent ways, it has been said that that was part of their intent.  The shadows of the impending Pheonix Saga are well placed and thought out.  Although there are only a couple of scenes with them together, Xaiver (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) make you really believe that they were at one time (and perhaps still are) very good friends.  Mystique (Stamos), instead of just being some eye-candy, takes a dominant roll on the movie.  Aside from that, the story was engaging, and the actors well met with their rolls.  <BR>I very much look forward to the next installment.  Fans of the comic series will appreciate the cameos and refernces to other characters as well.  Only one little nit-pick:  I thought Colosus was Russian.
B00003CY6M|4.0|As soon as I heard the strains from \\"Black Eyed Dog\\", one of my least favorite Nick Drake songs, I knew I was onto something.  The director's commentary track mentions that this is not a snip from Nick's original, but a rerecorded snippet (the rights cost too much).<br /><br />Here's a fine little \\"chick flick\\" that I drank with my eyes after borrowing the DVD from my niece.  Of course, I'm an emotionally hungry lifelong bachelor (so far, I figure I'll meet someone at some department store).<br /><br />This movie is easy to watch time after time, and for the most part gets better with every viewing.  I could have done without that kid in the devil suit.<br /><br />This one blows away Nora Ephron's \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" and \\"You've Got Mail\\", and even her best, \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  Okay, so that's not much of a claim.  It's even set (for the most part) in Ephron's beloved New York City.  The plot lulls the viewer into a false sense of security, misleads, evades, and in a way quite appropriate to the mysterious force that seems to toy with the lead characters.  The movie manages to remain fresh and entertaining and is romantic without being cloying or annoying.<br /><br />... along with this movie, it'll be good for your heart.

0345404475|5.0|<BR>This nice new edition of Dick's novel (it's insufficient to call it a masterpiece, because that's a tendency which runs through much of his output) will make an appropriate introduction to his body of work, particularly for the young aspiring writers in your family and circle of friends.  Like much of his work, it's deeply paranoid and warped, which is one of the attractive characteristics of it.<BR><BR>Yeah, that's right, it was the basis for the movie \\"Blade Runner\\", which sucks by comparison.  The movie \\"Total Recall\\" was based on Dick's super, tiny short story, \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\".  \\"Minority Report\\" was based on still another P.K. Dick story.  \\"Blade Runner\\" can be enjoyed for itself, as long as the viewer isn't expecting great cinema, or even a great sci-fi flick.  But it ain't this novel.<BR><BR>This one is an out of the park home run that smashes through the sun roof of a Lexus parked outside the ballfield, sets off the car alarm, and spills the cold coffee all over the leather upholstery.<BR><BR>
B000067CPX|3.0|First I'd like to say the Chili Peppers are a really, really good group of very good and experienced musicians. Their writing and performing chops are as good as anybody I've ever heard. They are my 25 year old daughters favorite band.The thing I can't get passed is trying to listen to a sound that is dry and unnatural sounding. In the recording process there is many effects available to help make a natural sound to the human ear. And I don't mean using effects just for the sake of changing the way something sounds. Anytime a sound enters our ears there are also reflections of that sound entering from all the reflective surfaces around the place where the sound was produced. I could go into this much deeper, but the only folks who might care are the ones that produced this dry unnatural recording. This type of recording started sometime back in the 90's. Why, I'm not quite sure, but guess it has to do with being cheaper and less time consuming or just another way to put something in your face. It's too bad. It just puts kind of an edge on it. But that's the way our society seems to be moving anyway. Some might think I'm just another old man spouting off. But I do have 40 years experience in the music business for whatever that's worth. I say to the Chili Peppers and their producers, at least consider what I've said. Of course you'd have to read this first. Fat chance of that happening. And now I'm going to take this CD and re-record it through my system adding just a touch of delay and some slight room ambience. And I already know I'll like it much better.
0064471837|5.0|We bought the audio book version of Sabriel on a whim for an all-day drive with our 11-year old daughter. True luck!  The trip was a pleasure as we journeyed into a wonderful world of heroes, magic, and fertile imagination.  This is not just another tired fantasy re-telling of dragons and trolls.  Indeed, Garth Nix has built a world that resonates with meaning and relevance.  All this in a book written for young adults.  Immediately upon returning home we purchased the next two books in the trilogy (Lirael and Abhorsen), also on tape.  Tim Curry did such a great job with the narration that we sat around the tape player as a family and listened before bedtime.  I'm sorry we're now finished.<br />This is a particularly good series for girls aged 10-14.  The most important figures are young women of strength and character.
0802130208|2.0|Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole is by far the most bizarre book I have ever read. John Kennedy Toole is a unique author to say the least. He displayed this ability to write a unique book when he when he wrote Confederacy of Dunces.  <BR> This 400page book takes place in New Orleans, which is a port city with many immigrants who come to America. All the different cultures that the immigrants come from represent uniqueness  which is a big part of Ignatius's personality. It is very fitting that Toole chose New Orleans as the setting for the book. The diversity of the city can be related to the diversity or uniqueness of Ignatius. <BR> Confederacy's main theme is how Ignatius is different from the rest of society but that he does not realize this. He does not realize in the book that if he lived anywhere else in the world he would not be able to complain or critique anything about the government like he does in the United States. Not only is Ignatius a little different than most people in society but all the characters who surround Ignatius day to day are also a bit \\"different\\". <BR>The book shows how Ignatius \\"who is not all their\\" functions in day to day society. I should say tries to function in day to day society. The book also reveals as time passes<BR>how Ignatius and his mother do not get along.  Once his mother meets the cop who almost arrested her son Ignatius because he looked suspicious, she slowly becomes friends with him. Before Ignatius realizes, Mancuso, who is the cop ,is at his house quite a bit and Ignatius is completely against him hanging out with his mom and being in his house. Ignatius slowly develops grudges against people and it is not just Mancuso.<BR> Ignatius begins to become enemy's with other characters such as Lana Lee who is the owner of the Night of Joy bar which is not a place where Ignatius is necessarily liked.   He is not liked by Lana because of the behavior he displayed when he went in her establishment after healmost got arrested by Mancuso. He told his mother on their walk back to the house from the store where he almost got arrested that he was very hungry and he could not wait till they got home to eat. So Irene took him to eat at Night of Joy but after they ate because of the hard day they had they both decided to get very drunk. Once they were drunk Ignatius started fights with the other customers and that is why Lana has been upset with him ever since. It is events like these that become a trend in the way Ignatius behaves as the book goes on. <BR> One of the reasons I disliked the book was because their was no moral to the story. The character never showed maturity as the book progressed. I think that if someone is going to write a book they need to have a reason or a plot to base it on. I feel as if Toole just wrote this book for the hell of it instead of writing to prove a theory or a point or to teach a lesson. Why would anyone want to read a book that has no point? To me this question is still unanswered and this is why I did not like Confederacy of Dunces.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|More of the same raw offerings from the timeless wayfarer and producer Rick Rubin. Though hampered in parts by poor song selection, namely wayward renditions of the overcooked \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" and the Eagles mawkish &quot;Desperado&quot;, \\"The man comes around\\" still manages to shake the soul to its core. Undoubtedly Cash is the only artist who can consistently perform songs in a manner equal or superior to the original. His rendition of Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; is one of the more affecting musical moments in recent memory whilst Sting's &quot;I hung my head&quot; and Depeche Modes &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, seem as natural to the Man in Black as \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" or \\"Hey Porter\\". Yet perhaps more remarkable is the continued quality of Cash's own songs, particularly the apocalyptic title track which stands alongside any of his best work. Another must have from the coolest man in music.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Tom Cruise is EXCELLENT, this movie tops out at number one for the best performance of Tom Cruise's career.  He plays the Vampire Lestat, a vain and ruthless immortal who longs to fill the loneliness of immortality.  Lestat comes across Louis de Pointe du lac (preformance by Brad Pitt )in 1791 who is suffering from the death of his wife and child.  Louis longing to be released from the pain of living is offered the choice by Lestat to \\"live forever\\".  This film is the best performance that Brad Pitt has ever given, he plays a convincing Louis de Pointe Du Lac who cannot accept what has became of him and refuses to take human life.  Kristen Dunst a marvelous new comer gives an outstanding performance of the Vampire Child \\"Claudia\\" who is forever sealed in the body of a 6 year old.  Antonio Banderas gives an equally outstanding performance as \\"Armand\\" the oldest vampire that Louis comes across during his search for answers to the meaning of his vampire life.  This movie is one of the best films since Gone with the Wind or Casablanca, Anne Rice the author of the book Interview with the Vampire is outstanding.  Her novels are a breathe of fresh air to the literary community, this is not your everyday vampire novel.  Her Vampire Chronicles give depth and meaning to life's age old questions.  She makes you think, while taking you into the beautiful centuries of the past. You are sure to come away from this film wanting more.

In heaven is where Susie now resides and she now watches over her family and her murderer.<BR> Alice Sebold creates a compelling story of a 14 year-old's desperation to hold on to her family in The Lovely Bones. She takes you on a lonesome road with Susie Salmon on her search for justice. Alice Sebold makes you feel all of the emotions Susie is having in heaven when rumors go around about her death, as her parent's marriage fall apart, and as she watches Mr. Harvey live without guilt.<BR> I enjoyed The Lovely Bones very much. Alice Sebold created amazing world of characters that almost anyone could relate to. Her writing style was unique and the fact that it was written in first-person made it easy to just get into the mind of Susie. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who really enjoys reading a truly movie story.
0345404475|5.0|Other SF writers have ideas; Philip K. Dick had visions.  In fact, all of his visions may be said to be part of a single Uber-vision, a life-long attempt to construct a picture of the world and to ask meaningful questions about it.  Most of his SF novels were different \\"takes\\" on this vision and explorations of those questions.  To say, as so many people have done (including Dick himself), that his themes are \\"what is reality\\" and \\"what is human\\", is to touch only on the surface of the problems he was grappling with.  It is necessary to understand how thoroughly Dick lived with his vision of life to know what his explorations meant, especially if one wishes to grasp their emotional center.<br /><br />Take this novel for instance (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?).  One could read it as if it were an ordinary SF novel and be fascinated by its \\"ideas\\", such as androids with false memories or the economy of real-animal trade in a post-apocalyptic setting -- in the same way that some fans of the \\"Star Trek\\" shows are interested in the structure of the Federation, the nature of the Borg, etc.  But Dick's ideas are nothing more than access points to his larger vision, and the novel has some interesting little conduits that can take you there.<br /><br />One thing of note (that few notice) is the idea of the \\"Penfield mood organ\\" which triggers an argument between Deckard and his wife in the opening chapter.  Apparently one selects a desired emotional state and \\"dials in\\" settings to send one's brain the electrical signals that create that emotion, such as \\"pleased acknowledgment of husband's superior wisdom in all matters\\".  The gadget is obviously named after Wilder Penfield, 20th century pioneer in brain mapping research.  (A variant of this idea was used later in another of Dick's robot-or-man novels, the neglected We Can Build You.)  Significantly, the device \\"frames\\" the novel, referenced again during the last scene.  Such a device is the least outlandish piece of \\"science fiction\\" that the novel contains, since it is based on real science.  And that fact roots the other speculations of the novel, however wild, in a very real and pressing contemporary question: if our moods and attitudes can be manipulated via electrical currents, then... what are we?<br /><br />Another fascinating aspect of the story is the quasi-religious figure named Mercer.  Mercer speaks at times with words like those of Christ, at other times with Zen riddles and self-contradiction.  He offers empathy without salvation, salvation without truth, a truth through lies.  When he is exposed as a fraud (when the set for the Mercer films is \\"subjected to rigorous laboratory scrutiny\\"), he admits it but insists that it does not detract from his validity.  Mercerism is the only hint of transcendence offered by the novel, which raises the question: if such transcendence is exposed as fraudulent, then... what can be our transcendence?<br /><br />The devastation that Deckard experiences in the end is a reflection of Dick's own emotional response to the conundrums of life as he saw it.  That's because his vision was never an abstract or academic construct, an intellectual game without consequences -- it was always a life-or-death matter for him.  And so it is for us, because Dick's true theme is neither ontology nor human identity, but the value of our existence, our origin and our fate, our relationships to one another and to God.on\\" that the novel contains, since it is based on real science.

The first CD in this collection is songs of a different version than the movie, but better versions I think.  The second CD has all the original movie versions and instrumentals.  Oh my gosh, the instrumentals on &quot;Your Song&quot; are beautiful.  There just isn't anything I can say bad about this CD collection.  I think it is just a perfect pick of songs to be on there.

Look up &quot;GoF&quot; on Google and see how many hits are retuned!<br />This book deserves its reputation. It has a prominent place on my shelf, where I can reach it easily. That's because I use it a lot.<br />A note of caution: This book is definitely not a tutorial! I first tried using the book to learn patterns, and got nowhere. If you want to learn design patterns, I'd suggest Martin, &quot;Agile Software Development&quot;. It covers several key patterns and the principles that govern their use. Another great book on the subject is Fowler, &quot;Refactoring&quot;. This book shows how to first write code that works, then massage the working code into design patterns to increase its flexibility.
0060930187|5.0|Well i must admit i am not quite done the book...I am more then halfway though. It was good when i started it and has only gotten better. I am suprised at how much i like this classic novel. I was afraid at first thinking i would not be able to undertand her ideas, but inturn i found i liked the way she looked at life. I liked the comparisons she made and how she described things. Partially through you would think she had a split personallity. I am reading this book for a class but i did it very early because the plot seemed interesting. I had no idea i would like the book this much..i can hardly put it down.
0385504209|2.0|Dan Brown got me hooked during the first 100 pages of the book, but brother (no pun intended) were the last few hundred pages a chore to finish reading. I have no Catholic axe to grind either, although the book was highly insulting to the Vatican-based organization. The reason I disliked the biggest portion of the book was that is was B-O-R-I-N-G. What a major disappointment after all the great reviews I'd read about it. Brown didn't deliver after a very good opening. It read like a bad movie script. Very shallow characters. No action. Predictable plot points. I would encourage you to go elsewhere for a great summer read!

0316666343|1.0|I read this book after many recommendations (from friends who have the same taste in books that I do.) and found it almost unreadable.  None of the characters held my interest at all.  I kept waiting for the book to get better, but sadly it did not.  I am still wondering what so many people see in it.  I had to skim to end it was so boring.
0385504209|5.0|Brown crafts a fascinating story by combining things that are true and things that could be true. It's the only mystery I've read where I wish there were footnotes. It's a thriller, so the fast pace and twisting plot carry more weight than the characters.<br />If you like a great story with some interesting historical nuggets, read this. If you like a mystery based on religious themes but with intricate, nuanced characters, read Name of the Rose.<br />One more note: Some of the reviewers here have &quot;spoilers&quot; in their reviews. I wish they would add the note &quot;Spoiler&quot; to their headlines so folks who haven't read the book could skip them if they wish.

Maybe you are venturing into Japanese animation on your own.<br />This is an excellent movie, and an exemplary display of the \\"Anime\\" genre. Truely, this is a classic movie.<br />If you saw this once in a theater you'd probably be confused. But you've purchased (or are about to purchase) a masterpiece DVD. Repeated viewings are a given and will be rewarded.<br />What does it mean to be human? _The Matrix_, _Blade Runner_, and the like have all asked this question. When does a computing machine stop being a pile of plastic and metal and start becoming life-like?<br />_Ghost in the Shell_ addresses this question and answers it.<br />If you like watching movies, if you like answering life's puzzles, if you like genre busting and paradigm shifting films, you'll really like _Ghost in the Shell_.
B000002J1B|4.0|This CD is quite out of the ordinary, even for YES.  With Gates Of Delirium clocking in at around 30 minutes, it is one hell of a song, prog rock or not.  It is a very meaty listen.  Not recommended for children or republicans, grin.  Very time changy, very complicated, and if you like this sorta stuff, this is a CD that will set you on fire.  I like it, but it is not my favorite YES CD.  Close to the Edge or Fragile even The Ladder or Magnification are the CD's I like better than this, but that does not mean it is a bad choice.
055357342X|5.0|I'm sorry for the title of my review, but it just seems after reading the negative reviews for this book and series, I've come to the conclusion that this book is not for everyone, especially the stupid.  Look, do I think these books are better than Tolkien's grand epic, absolutely, but that's the point, it's my opinion.  If you asked George, he would say \\"no way.\\"  So, instead of comparing it to the one sided characters of Lord of the Rings, you need to look at the characters of this book for what they really are, arguably the most human characters ever written in the Genre.  The depth of Jaime Lannister and the other not so likeable characters is true compassion to the story. I am tired of reading crap where the good guy always wins or a farm boy from the small province is really the long lost relative of the king...you know what I'm talking about.  I can sit here for hours describing the precision and care that he puts into all his characters, the way he treats them equally and realistically, but there is no point doing that.  I'm going to leave it at this. If you truly understand who we are as human beings, you will love these books, however if you are an ignorant zealot, you of course will not.  So go read the Terry Goodkind or Robert Jordan or the bible if that's your kind of fiction.
B00008DDXB|5.0|I am a huge fan of the &quot;Harry Potter Series&quot; by J.K. Rowling, and was thoroughly delighted when Warner Brothers began making films based on the books. &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; was verry enjoyable, but I particularly enjoyed &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot; because it is my fivorite book in the series, and because the actors/actresses portraying the characters seem more well-rounded. I was spellbound (pardon the pun!) from the verry beginning of the film, and I especially liked the sceens at the Weasley household. Despite some minor changes and omissions, which, in my opinion, are regrettably  missed, but  which do not take away from the plot, the story unfolds, and though the second book in the series is a bit more sinister, as Harry's struggles against his ultimate enemy, Lord Voldemort, are more sinister and suspenseful, director Chris Columbus does well at adding light touches which actually made me laugh out loud, (that's pretty rare) during a movie. Richard Harris is absolutely outstanding as Dumbledore, and of course the kids' are terrific. I must give a quick compliment to actor Christian Coulsen, who portrayed Tom Riddle. I'm sure that it took an awfully lot of work to portray that particular character, because I know from personal experionce that playing a villain/villainess takes a lot of work. Good job! Everyone should take the time to see this movie in order to appreciate the wonderful acting skills, and the deep lessons of self-sacrifice, loyalty, and the point of being careful and not being deceived. Take care, and happy watching to you all!
B00007AJGH|4.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit? is a wonderful movie that has delighted movie-goers of all ages.<br />It is a gem.<br />Before buying this DVD, note that it is not a completely faithful reproduction of the original theatrical release.  It has been censored (by Disney).  The censorship involves animation in two separate scenes.  Two scenes, both involving Jessica Rabbit.<br />If you are a movie purist, or simply object to censorship of material that was widely available on the big screen more than a decade ago, then this disc might not be right for you.<br />However, the movie is a treat even without those missing frames of animation.  And you might not consider censorship a big deal.  <br />But it is nice to know what you are getting before you commit to the purchase.
B000059XUO|3.0|An ineludible reference in every Neo-Goth kid's wardrobe, \\"The Crow\\" is one of those movies that favor style over substance. Its success is, however undeniable: after all, it spwaned two sequels and a TV series. It also has to live with a very infamous reputation, since action star Brandon Lee was accidentally killed during the shoot. Now, for the movie, it's a classic tale of love and revenge beyond death. A rock-musician called Eric Draven (no pun intended, or is it?) is brutally killed, along with his girlfriend, by a pack of hooligans. One year later, whoever is in charge in the next world grants him a chance to come back as a living dead super-hero and take a not less brutal revenge on the runamuckers who had their number. All this he does with a fellow crow on his shoulders. The rest of the plot is superflous: in the midst of all this mayhem are the local cops who had little to do against the band of thugs that hold the city hostage, so, in the end, the Crow is avenging not only the death of himself and his girl, but all deaths.<br />Personally, I'm not a huge fan, but if you are, then you shouldn't even blink in front of this edition. Since it takes 2 discs, the picture and sound quality is the best you're going to find, as well as tons of stuff about the making of this comic-book-like film. Of course, a lot of the material is dedicated to the unfortunate demise of Brandon Lee, who happened to die in very similar conditions to those of his father.<br />\\"The Crow\\" is probably not one of my favorite films, but it does have an undeniable cult audience. It picked up the pace set by Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\" and took it to the next level. However, even to these people I would recommend director Alex Proya's much superior \\"Dark City\\", though it's not one of my favorite films either, it does raises more questions than this super-hero flick.

068484267X|4.0|Most people would agree that life is frequently difficult.  Life may seem easy after reading Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt.  Angela's Ashes is a true classic.  It is timeless, addresses the history of Ireland, and evokes emotion.  Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt is a memoir of the hard times he and his family experienced during his life in Ireland during the 1930s and 1940s.<BR>Angela's Ashes is a timeless memoir that will last through the ages.  Twenty to thirty years from now people will still read and enjoy this book.  People are easily taken into the well-written memoir about families that are poor, living under inhuman conditions.  There was little heat, food, or clean water.  Christianity was and is the main religious belief in Ireland.  Today people continue to attend church each Sunday and Limerick is still the holiest place in Ireland.  The description of the life of the McCourts, sixty to seventy years ago, is so vivid and tragic, many readers were waiting for a sequel, hoping that some good could come to the lives of these children who lived with abuse and hunger.    <BR>Readers may not easily relate to McCourt's stories of Ireland, the church, and the suffering experienced by the poor Irish, but they can feel the pain and suffering through McCourt's descriptions.  Angela's Ashes actively involves the reader with the hardships the McCourts experienced.  Frank McCourt addresses the history of his place of birth, Limerick, Ireland.  Malachy, Frank McCourt's father, often made the children promise to die for Ireland. Frank McCourt's father demanded, \\"I want you to jump out of that bed and line up here like two soldiers and promise to die for Ireland and I'll give the two of you the Friday penny.\\"  (111)  England was Ireland's enemy for many years.  The times were hard and men were asked to die for Ireland, if needed.  Frank McCourt was a part of the history and suffering of the poor Irish.  The reader will feel the pain his father puts upon his family, dueto his beliefs, his anger, his drinking habits, and his lack of good work ethics.    <BR>The well-written memoir of Frank McCourt's life evokes emotions. Three of the children die depressing deaths.  Margaret, McCourt's only sister, died at a young age. Oliver, one of the twins, then died and soon after Eugene appeared to have died of a broken heart.  The family fell apart after the death of each child.  The story is written with an emotional impact for the reader.<BR>Angela's Ashes is a classic of the highest quality.  Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, is a memoir that is visually stimulating.  It evokes emotion and should be read and enjoyed by all.  The memoir is so moving that McCourt stated, \\"I could never have written this book while my mother was alive, she would not have liked it.  We were always ashamed to have grown up in the slums.... She suffered a lot.... She was a depressed and angry woman.\\"  All readers will definitely feel compassion for Mrs. McCourt and her family.
038572179X|5.0|I cannot believe the number of negative reviews I see on this site for this book!  Yes, it's a little slow to start, but I persisted and it quickly drew me in.  McEwan's writing is effortlessly exquisite.  One of the reviews inside the first few pages of the book says &quot;it will break your heart&quot;.  I think that sums up my feelings more than anything else I've read about it.  Definitely a must read if you appreciate beautifully detailed storytelling.  <br />If you liked 'Corelli's Mandolin', you may like this as well.
B000007MVM|4.0|After hearing all of Syd's material from his halcyon days with Pink Floyd this album hit me from a different angle. The Madcap Laughs is the sound of Syd Barrett stripped down and bare, the supersonic sounds of Interstellar Overdrive, See Emily Play and Astronomy Domine seem very distant.  However, Octopus can bring back memories of his Floyd days since it wouldn't have been out of place on Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.  While most songs are great like Octopus, Terrapin, Lone Gone, Here I Go, Late Night and Golder Hair, there are some songs (She Took A Long Cold Look, Feel and If It's In You) that almost make you cry because you realize that his creative muse has left him. \\"Feel\\" is an intensely personal song where Syd almost bares his soul to you with lyrics like \\" I feel so alone, I want to go home\\".  \\"Dark Globe\\" is a disturbing song where he sings absolutely off key and the lyrics tell alot of how he knows about his mental state.  This is an amazingly personal album that is toned down to being an acoustic album.  I suppose his swansong on \\"A Saucerful Of Secrets\\" (Jugband Blues) may have hinted towards the direction he chose during his solo years.  Either way, it's an intriguing album to listen to especially if you know about Syd's story.

B00005RYLE|5.0|This will sound weird, but I first saw this film on Christmas Eve, 1994.  I had seen Army of Darkness, and thought myself well acquainted with Ash and the Deadites...how stupid could I get?<br />I was alone, so I rented all three films and sat down with a bottle of Jameson's to watch what I assumed would be back-to-back-toback horror comedies...nothing I couldn't handle, and perfect for a Christmas Eve, no?<br />What I saw in this film cut my life by at least a few years. From the creepy approach to the cabin, to the first appearance of a deadite (the now-classic \\"jack-of spades\\" psychic bit), to Ash's ultimate descent into the madness of the moment, I was not only riveted, but horrified constantly.<br />ED2 and AOD are wonderful, fun, creative movies, to be sure, with lots of suspense amidst the laughs, but this is pure, unadulterated soul-disturbing stuff.  Argento with no budget.  Romero without morality.  In-effing-credible.  Possibly the best horror flick ever.<br />PS>  After watching, if you're a first timer, go read Bruce's book.  Hearing his humorous account of the trials of filming this is almost as good as watching, and a great adjunct to the film.
B00000JNJ1|5.0|This album is excelent as it contains some of the best faces music! Take a great drummer like Kenny Jones, a greart Key boardist like Ian McLagan, two great guitarists like Ronnie Wood and Ronnie land and what do you get? Fantistic music! What happens when you mesh that all wogether with Rod's voice? You struggle to get enough of this!  As a big Rod Stewart fan at 19 years old I find his faces stuff throloughy enjoyable! My favourite song happens to be 'Three Botton hand me down'. it's one that I find myself singing on the way home from College. Love lives here Nearly reduced me to tears as Rod's voice is just perfecvt for this and Ohh La La is a perfect description of women. Lane was very smart back then! Then theres other titles that are cool- Flying, Wicked Messenger (originally by Bob Dylan!) Sweet Lady mary,Pool hall Richard, You can make me dance singor anything and Stay with me! I'd recomend this C.D to everyone!
B00006RIO7|3.0|I really, really. really want to give this five stars, and I would if this didn't have the last two tracks by Macy Gray, Lil Kim, Anastacia, etc.  They were completely out of place and didn't belong here (they're just annoying). The only reason I can think of for them is some kind of contract obligation on the part of the record company.  Anyway, that is the only problem with this album.  If you enjoy the movie, then go get the soundtrack.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I just turned 15 and I've loved Madonna since I was around six years old. I had my first Madonna CD in 1995 (Bedtime stories)when I was only about 7 and a half. I then got Ray of Light in 1999 when I was eleven and that was great. The next year, Music came out and I loved the title track and 'Don't tell me' as well as 'What it feels like...' and 'JUST ABOUT ALL THE 10 SONGS ON THE cd BUT it got played out by KISS FM, but her new album is her best yet. I love AMERICAN LIFE, HOLLYWOOD, I'M SO STUPID, LOVE PERFUSION, DIE ANOTHER DAY, MOTHER AND FATHER and NOTHING FAILS the most. There is 11 tracks. I think too many tracks are too slow for teen audiences, but there is like 4 or 5 really good beat pounders too. Alot of techno, bitchin' guitar and vocal, Madonna's most mature album since Erotica and Bedtime stories. I recommend new fans AMERICAN LIFE as well as IMMACULATE COLLECTION & GHV2. mADonna is known for changing her styles and boyfriends faster then light can flash, but that's what makes me like her, she's not allways the same story. Get THIS if you are thinking about it.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is one of the best books I've read.  The plot, themes, and characters are all very deep.  It's good from beginning to end.  I highly recommend this book.
B000050FEN|4.0|&quot;Seven&quot; is a movie that really gets under your skin, and it's not easily forgotten. David Fincher's dark and violent thriller about a serial killer who kills by the 7 deadly sins is a rewarding experience, provided you can stomach it. The acting from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman as police partners carries the movie, while the suspense keeps you on edge from start to finish.<br />The New Line DVD is loaded with (mostly) quality extras. You can expect to see the movie four times just for the commentary, the best of which are from Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman. David Fincher is a bore, on the other hand, speaking mostly in monotone and rambling on for too long. The suppliments on disc 2 cover almost every aspect of the movie, from a featurette on the opening title sequence (which is very good by the way), to deleted scenes and alternate endings in storyboard format. I found the alternate endings the most interesting since I absolutely hated the one that made it into the movie.<br />Perhaps the most interesting suppliment is the photo galleries. The production team went all out the make the photographs as unpleasant as possible. There is a collection of gruesome crime scene photos with commentary from director of photography, you may want to take a shower after viewing these-they're nasty. Also included are John Doe's notebooks and &quot;Sloth&quot; victim decomposition photos for good measure. The galleries alone make this worth checking out, as it's hard not to appreciate the work that went into them. Rounding out the extras are the usual promotional fodder that is good for a one-time glance, but is otherwise nothing special.<br />&quot;Seven&quot; is a great movie that gets the DVD release it deserves. Though it is not for every taste, it is a fun and rewarding experience. Fans will undoubtedly love the extras.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I absolutely live by this disc. There style is so creative and inspiring and as a musician, I strive to be half as cool as wilco.
0440539811|5.0|Is this trilogy a fantasy, a treatise, a cosmic romp, or the stream of consciousness meanderings of two madmen? I think yes.<br />Wilson and Shea, in their only collaboration, have a great time weaving conspiracies, numerology, science, pseudoscience, practically everything else they can get their minds around.<br />The writing is lively, outrageous, and funny, but the details and cross references of ideas means that one should take the time to read these books when there are few distractions.<br />Do not, however, use these books as a basis for Sunday school lessons or self-improvement exercises.<br />The 23 enigma is given full play here, so be on guard. Once let loose, it will overwrite your neurolinguistic programming and established paradigms.<br />(I loaned a friend my first set of these books for him to read while he was traveling in Europe. As he was reading in the books a scene where the characters visit the statue of the Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, he decided to do the same. When he returned to his room, the second and third books were missing. Nothing else was taken including the first volume.)
0385504209|3.0|This book is by no means a classic but it will keep you entertained while you're reading it.  There are some interesting ideas and surprising moments in the text but nothing extraordinary.  This book will remind you of the new Star Wars series where the action and on-screen visuals are spectacular but the overall product is a little hollow.
B000002IJL|4.0|This cd is a great collection of what I think a kid in the 50's grew up listening to. They are all staples that you've always heard, and perhaps taken for granted. They are all classics. This is a wonderful collection. I'd give it five stars but it clocks in at 30 minutes.
B0000028SR|4.0|The Springsteen CD Human Touch is the first one he did without the E Street Band. At times he suceeds, other times he fails. The title song is very enjoyable and has  ice beats in it, but it has some lyrics that weren't really needed 8/10<BR>Soul Driver, the second track is probably ne of the worst things he's ever recorded. The opening music feels weird and unenjoyable. Worst of all, he puts in words such as &quot;Then here's to our destruction.&quot; He should burn the lyrics. 1/10<BR>57 Channels(and Nothin' On&quot; is decent enough. Here he mocks the real world and its way for television. In the final verse he is sent to court for shooting his television set, simply because he wanted to honor Elvis. 8/10<BR>Cross My Heart lacks interestng lyrics but in return we receive a slow and smooth bluesy guitar beat. 7/10<BR>Gloria's Eyes Just like Soul Driver, only worse 0/10<BR>With Every Wish is one of the album's best songs because it feels relaxed and it wants to tell you part of a man's journey in life. 9/10<BR>Roll of the Dice tells about how a man can lose money AND lose love while gambling. He wants to make a song that can make you perk up, but I usually skip it 6/10<BR>Real World is the albums best song.I feels good, rocks out but stays calm, and tells how lovers who lose their luck should just head out,a true masterpiece. 10/10<BR>All or Nothin' at All is a song that usually I enjoy that beat and lyrics, but I can't help thinking what this was made for. 7/10<BR>Man's Job is another winner that tells in a slow manner how love betrays a man, and how he plans to have it returned. I stays smooth and it doesn't fail. 9/10<BR>I Wish I Were Blind is a clone of Man's Job except a little slower, but not as good. 7/10<BR>The Long Goodbye is a very enjoyable track were the man echos out how hard losing love is. I found this to be a big pleasure. 8/10<BR>Real Man is the track were the man tells the women he doesn't need to be tough in order to be loved. I found this to begripping at times, dull at others. 7/10 Pony Boy is the final track and it ends the album in a very disarming way. The song is another rewrite of the folk song,and feels like like a very comforting experience. 8/10<br />Final Say: 8/10 Needed many improvements but is an enjoyable experience.
B000006U44|4.0|The Kick Inside was Kate Bush debut album and became a huge hit in the UK and around the world except in the US. It may not be perhaps her most mature or best album but it is indeed very good album. All the tracks are well composed and produced and Kates vocal style and range is spetacular. Lyrically this album is merely about love and relationships and she does not explore as much on this one like the next releases. Some of the songs are simple but manage to bring something fresh. The Kick Inside is however a bit dated and many songs may not be as accesable as others. However this is a impressive debut my a huge talent that is one of the greatest artist of all time.
0385504209|4.0|If you are the mood for a fast-paced, highly entertaining mystery, this is your next read.  The extent of the author's research into the worlds of western religion and art history become evident immediately.  In fact, the breadth of need-to-know-tidbits are about the only parts of the book that will slow you down.  Brown's descriptions of Paris and the Louvre visually launched me into the world of the main characters Robert Langdon and Sophie Nuevue.  If you are looking for depth and character development, look elsewhere.  Remember, this is a mystery, not historical fiction.
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces. John Kennedy Toole. New York: Grove Press, 1980. 394 pages.<br />           It's unfortunate that John Kennedy Toole took his life before this Pulitzer Prized book was published. His unique perspectives could have been useful to better the mentality of contemporary culture. This fictional novel, valuable to any reader, focuses on the ridiculous tragedies of a hedonist society. Taking place in New Orleans, the focal point of the story is Ignatius J. Reilly, an absurdly irrational man. Throughout the whole book, Toole emphasizes the ironic connection between Ignatius' rash disgruntlement and his lack of productivity. Even though it's arduous to read at times, John Kennedy Toole's book, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, is of immense value.<BR>             Ignatius Reilly is a 33 year-old porcine slob who still lives with his mother. He is educated and has potential, but does little to better his withering life. When forced, Ignatius holds menial jobs, but ruins the continuance of the companies and coworkers. Mrs. Reilly, his mother, explains her son's damaging assessment as, \\"It's a good thing his poor poppas dead. He'd be breaking his poor father's heart with that weenie wagon.\\"(p 202) Throughout the book, Ignatius' legendary presence is even enough to perturb the paltry existence of all the supporting characters: his mother, his employers, and several other random acquaintances. Virtually all of Ignatius' mishaps stem from his dissatisfaction with a society that won't tend to his every desire.<BR>             A parallel can be drawn with Toole's ultimate frustration with society and Ignatius' actions. The novel encompasses a vast irony that displays a pleasure seeking society that blames everything else, but neglects to mend internally. Ignatius, who is only one example of the bigger whole, lashes out and dissects every imperfection of others but refuses to work on his own varied faults. Ignatius and America are seemingly comparable: massive, manipulative, parochial, and reluctant to take negative responsibility.  Toole illustrates this metaphor possibly to provoke some sort of realization, but ultimately it overwhelms him. He was a genius and Jonathan Swift in `Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting' describes that burden best, \\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.\\"<BR>           John Kennedy Toole's fictional novel, A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES, is one of merit. The 394 pages seem to drag on at times, but only to completely portray a valuable lesson; the need to focus inwardly, personally and entirely, is urgent. I recommend this book to anyone, for this kind of enlightenment must be spread in order for a revitalization of American way. I'm only sorry that Toole's perspective now only carries on through Ignatius, because it is vivid, original, and practical. A friend of Toole's, David Kubach, describes Toole's noble trouble in an autobiography, \\"He did not suffer fools gladly, and I think he was afraid of becoming one. He couldn't live with that.\\"

0802130208|1.0|Many people have experiences in life where they find themselves in a situation where their opinion does not follow what a larger group may think. In the book A Confederacy of Dunces, by John Kennedy O'Toole, the main character Ignatius finds himself in this situation through out the whole story. The book does a great job displaying a situation where the reader can relate to certain sitations that the main character is in. At the same time, the author does a great job creating a character that evokes powerful emotions from the reader.<br />The book is about a man, Ignatius, who finds himself to be living in a world where he is surrounded by people who are ignorant about what really matters in the world. His subliminal goal is to help people realize this and set them in a direction where they can continue living their life in a way that is more real and fulfilling. Ignatius seems also to be caught between his mother and her dimentia of thinking that the world, including her son, are against her. Ignatius ends up being forced through different jobs and he burns a scandalous past through every place that he becomes apart of. In the end, Ignatius loses his last job as hot dog vendor, sparks a 500 thousand dollar law suit, retires a woman who has wanted to have been retired for years, but someone was convinced that she wanted to work where she was, is sent to a mental hospital by his confused and mentally blocked mother, and elopes with his ex girlfriend who he keeps in touch with through mail through out the story.<br />The book does a great job displaying the theme of ignorance through a variety of characters who the reader can watch lie and cheat their way into the hopeful dream of achieving the American Dream of being happy and making money easily. Although the book is written in a way that can be tiring and sluggish at times, once the reader completes the book, looking back on it leaves one with a feeling of accomplishment and a new knowledge and view on life and thepeople in it.
B0000024UX|5.0|More than three decades later this album still reveals its treasures with every listen. It's the absolute highlight of the folk-influenced or singer/songwriter genre that emerged in the 1960s. The greatness of the songs are proved by the many cover versions that they inspired: Bridge much be one of the most covered songs on earth - the versions by Aretha Franklik and Linda Clifford immediately come to mind. El Condor Pasa has exotic Andean flute and Cecilia is a naughty, uptempo song that became a dance hit again in the 1980s by some obscure disco singer. Songs like The Boxer and Bye Bye Love are sheer poetry, I mean lyrically and in their flowing melodies and the beautiful blend of the voices. This album remained in the album charts for many years after its original release and one listen will show you the reason why. Poetic, intelligent lyrics set to heavenly melodies characterise these outstanding songs to make the album a timeless classic.
0786867973|4.0|I love Nigella Lawson's writing, and her cookbooks are beautiful, but beware the amounts of ingredients, especially of butter and oils.  Maybe the translations of ingredients for the American edition are at fault, but in most of the recipes I've tried so far, there was entirely too much butter -- so much that I found that the taste and scent of other ingredients such as almonds and lemons were almost totally drowned out.  I have gone back and halved the amount of butter called for in many recipes, and the cakes, etc., have come out much better.  I have also halved the number of eggs and experienced better results.  I am not into low-fat baking recipes, but the fat content in many of these is so high it is almost ridiculous, and, without question, unnecessary.  Definitely buy the book because it really is wonderful reading, but be careful and trust your instincts when it comes to amounts of ingredients.  This is not a good book for beginner cooks: you really need to know your way around baking in order to fix up the recipes for good results.  If you do have experience, however, it is a delight for good baking and cooking ideas. I have all of Nigella Lawson's books and do love them.
B00000ILBK|3.0|Jonathan Frakes returned to the director's chair to helm this ninth installment in the Star Trem motion picture series and third with the Next Generation crew.  Captain Picard and crew travel to a shangri-la like planet whose inhabitants haven't aged in over 300 years and uncover a conspiracy lying within the Federation to take over the planet and re-locate it's inhabitants.  The lighthearted plot is pretty routine and basic for a Trek film, although Insurrection tries to retain some of the original Trek's merits, and the film has a few comedic moments (such as Picard and Worf dueting a rendition of the HMS Pinafore to distract a seemingly malfunctioning Data) and is pretty amusing all in all.  F.Murray Abraham hams it up under some great makeup as the villianous Ru'afo, and although Insurrection isn't the worst film in the series, it feels like a two part big budget episode of The Next Generation.  Since it's release Insurrection has gotten a lot of bashing from Trekkies, and while I can see some of their points, Insurrection is still worth watching.
0375414053|4.0|This book was a wonderful read while on a business trip, I loved the witty humor and could really relate to the juggling act of the protagonists, Kate Reddy's life.  The mixed opinions of co-workers and family members that working mother's face as well as the conflicted emotions we ourselves have, are all represented but with a tongue in cheek representation that make them entertaining to read no matter what your stance.
B00008RH1H|4.0|If there was ever a storyline that revolved around naked ambition, this is it. THRONE OF BLOOD is commonly referred to as Akira Kurosawa's masterful adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. It is much more than that.  And less.  Although the heart of the plot remains, Shakespeare's words are gone.  In their place are extraordinary images that are the visual equivalent to Shakespeare's expressions. And the setting has been transposed to 16th century feudal Japan.  Toshiro Mifune is unforgettable as Washizu, the samurai who betrays his friend and in exchange for nobility. Thousands of pages have been written about Throne of Blood and no condensed review can do justice to this majestic and intense film.  It simply must be experienced.  Highest recommendation.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|This movie is a load of crap, but it's an entertaining and endearing load of crap - until the directors veer into the real story, of which we care not one whit about. The more I watch movies, the more I find that directors thinking that the story should lead when it shouldn't (and vice-versa), is a common fundamental fault. <br />It stars, obviously, Donnie Darko, a strange and smart disturbed young man who forgets to take his medication, with alarming results - an apparition makes him sleepwalk out of the house. That is fortunate, because an unexplained plane jet falls on the house, but being outside he is undamaged. Oh yeah, and the end of the world is near. <br />Donnie Darko is an interesting movie, in that it refuses obstinately to fit into the mold of \\"disturbed teenager\\" movies - it is almost cheerful and enthusiastic about finding comedy in the unlikeliest of places. Unfortunately, this energy is eventually set aside for plot and symbolism, which in the context does not make much sense, and we don't care. <br />At the end of his review, Roger Ebert comments : <br />\\"(...) somehow the control fades in the closing scenes, and our hands, which have been so full, close on emptiness. ''Donnie Darko'' is the one that got away. But it was fun trying to land it.\\"
6305524866|4.0|OK so this film may have been on TV quite a few times now, but you need to own a copy too. It's one of those films you can watch time and time again without getting tired of it. Every time I have seen this I have picked up something new.<br />The film centres around the character of Charles, played by Hugh Grant, who sees his friends getting married (and in one case dying) which causes him to think about his own relationships and what the future has in store for him, while all the time making witty (and sometimes silly) comments on his friends' actions.<br />While Grant is undoubtedly the star, this is to some extent an ensemble piece and there are delightful performances from John Hannah and Simon Callow in particular. Watch out for the late Charlotte Coleman as well. Andie MacDowell is the American here, yet does not seem at all out of place in the curious world of eccentricity, class, and tomfoolery into which she is thrown (I can say this, I am English!).<br />The script is just brilliant, by Blackadder/Vicar Of Dibley  writer Richard Curtis, and is another element that makes you want to watch the film again and again.<br />Finally, the film has one great thing to recommend it, and that is a sympathetic deaf character who does not appear to have been put in the film solely because of his disability, and who is served well by a script that neither patronises nor ignores his deafness.
1401200613|5.0|This is the hardcover edition of the first five parts of a 12 part story, and it is an amazing one! I used to collect anything Jim Lee illustrated and thats how i found this title, so it goes without saying that his art in this book (and on the regular monthly issues) is amazing.  Jeph Loeb's storyline is also top notch.  In just the first 4 parts we've already got Killer Croc, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Superman and the next few issues (not included in this volume) turn out more suprise guests and villains.  This one is an instant classic.  That other review from the 14 year old kid....he knows what hes talking about.  I'm a 22 year old (kid) and i dig this stuff.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|The print quality of this DVD truly is astonishing for a film made in 1927. However, I still prefer the Giorgio Moroder version which I saw for the first time in a NY movie theater in the 1980's. The soundtrack touched me on a emotional level, and since it was the first time I'd seen the film in any form, I'll never be able to shake that first-time feeling I got from that version. To this day, I can't see another version of this film without remembering the &quot;here's my heart&quot; song played during that first touching scene with Maria and Freder. Also, the Moroder version used still photos AND sub-titles to fill in for missing scenes, which is preferable to just using title cards. Why does the KINO version not integrate the still photos into the movie?? I also prefer the tinting in the Moroder version. It helped define the &quot;feel&quot; for each of the different envirionments/scenes in the film. Also, this version didn't seem to contain any scenes that weren't in the Moroder version (which contains many scenes not found in other releases), if it did, they were very brief. However, this is still an excellent version of the film to own.
B0000931OG|5.0|this is one of blurs finest albums. far gone are the days of britpop country house into a much more mature sound, from the opening soulful mood of ambulance to the closing (in my opinion overrated) battery in your leg. highlights are the rockier 'Crazy Beat' and the more dance infused 'Brothers and Sisters'. This album is much more melodical that the previous &quot;13&quot;, thanks to the departure of the random lo-fi influences of Graham Coxon. This is a release that that will find a nice home in your permanent CD collection. However, if you preferred the poppier sound of 'parklife' and 'country house' I suggest you purchase the 'busted' album. Not quite worth 5 stars but considering everyone else has given this album such a dismal score I felt I needed to raise the average. Just a final note... providing the US and UK release of this album are the same, and considering there is not one offensive word on the album I'm somewhat confused why this has obtained an 'explicit lyrics' sticker. Don't let this put you off if it had done previouly.

That girl can rock it out and sing and wow......it rocks. This cd is sooooooo sweet and it deserves the 5 stars i gave it. ROCK ON!
0451191153|3.0|Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is verbose and preachy.   It is obvious that this novel is her attempt to convert people to her philosophy.   Essentially what you have are long speeches by main characters, which is merely her vehicle to push her systematic view of the world.  I've never heard of her philosophy before but after 700+ pages of her beating me over my head with it I don't think I'll forget about objectivism.<br />I doubt that would I ever read another book by her, even though it was a relatively fast read.
0689859368|5.0|Mr. DiTerlizzi is an outstanding illustrator and writer of childrens' books that recapture the wonder of childhood. From begining to end the book blended the real human feelings and trials of childhood with the fantastical denizens of childhood dreamscapes.

7119005901|5.0|Three Kingdoms is undoubtedly the most popular novel ever written in the Chinese language. For centuries since it's publication, it has enjoyed unparalled success and been the source of inspirations to many. The 17th century nomadic tribal chief and founder of the Qing Dynasty is said to have derived many of the strategies of his compaign conquering China from Three Kingdoms. This alone tells the immense impact of the novel on Chinese civilization. : ) The book has also immortalized many of its characters. For instance, Guan Yu has become a Daoist deity and symbol of courage and loyalty (and so has his sidekick, Chou Cang, who in fact never appeared in true historical records). Altough in pure literary sense, Three Kingdoms probably may not be as connotative as Outlaws of the Marsh and not as beautifully written as Dream of the Red Chamber, it has proven to be the most enduring and universally popular.

B00008RH3L|5.0|The best Coen Film yet made, which puts it among the best ever made.  <br />There are more moments of genius in Miller's Crossing than one can count.  The &quot;Danny Boy&quot; scene wherein Albert Finney establishes that he is still &quot; . . . an artist with the Thompson&quot; is so effortlessly grand and brutal that it rivals any scene in any film from any era. The Coens have the best collective ear for dialogue and the most economical  sense of visual story telling of any filmmakers who ever lived.  Simply the best.

B000002WPI|5.0|The Wu-Tang Clan took the Lost boro of Staten Island and transformed it into the lyrical poetic super-power of Shaolin.  Using clips from Martial Arts films, and incorporating The Shaolin fighting style into their already deep rooted lyrics, Wu-Tang has brought something eye-popping, thought provoking and smart to the rap/Hip-Hop game.  The RZA, a beat genius, takes unorthodox piano keys and eccentric loops to create the theme and setting for this dark walk through Staten Island and Brooklyn's Hip-Hop scene.  RZA, ODB, GZA, Masta Killa, Raekwon, Ghostface Killah, U-God, Inspektah Deck, and Method Man are the clansman.  They all have they own fighting style and all deadly with their Liquid Swords. Complex metaphors and strange punchlines incorporated with deep words of poetry make this cd an incredible edition to a real Hip-Hop head's collection.  In my opinion, The GZA(the head of Voltron) who is the oldest member of the Clan is the best lyricist and MC(mic constructer).  He is a walking metaphor.  He tries to make everything as metaphorical as possible, and you can see a little bit of how dope he is on CLan in Da Front.  But every Wu member is ill in their own way.  SHaolin is on the Hip-Hop map forever.  And with this revolutionary debut, Wu has given birth to Killarmy, Wu Syndicates, Sunz Of Man, and Gravediggaz.  All and All, The RZA's beats and the madd nasty lyricism of all the CLan's liquid swords make this a Hip-Hop classic and one of the greatest cds of all time. ...
0802130208|2.0|A Confederacy of Dunces, written by John Kennedy Toole, is a novel that sheds light on those normally unseen in a novel. In other words, the main characters in this novel would normally take a backseat to personalities that are easier to relate to, in other books. Ignatius Reilly, the main focus of the novel, is an overweight, middle-aged, lethargic man, whose experiences land him in many different and absurd situations.<BR> Other characters, such as Ignatius' mother, are also, if not more, eccentric than Ignatius. Irene Reilly has been living with her son his whole life and cannot seem to get him to shape up to be an upstanding citizen that makes contributions to society instead of lying in bed writing absolute nonsense on tablets of paper. She seldom leaves the house, due to Iganatius' constant need for care, and therefore has no social life until she meets detective Mancuso. Having recently run into Mancuso, due to a scene made by her son, he eventually befriends her and Mrs. Reilly slowly gains the courage to leave Ignatius at home at night and on weekends. Their friendship introduces Mancuso's Aunt who tries to get Mrs. Reilly to commit Ignatius to an asylum. This to Mrs. Reilly is a horrible thought.<BR> This novel has an interesting idea behind it, that the main characters are the most unlikely personalities in a novel to be the main focus. However the book's chapters seem to drag on and, at times, ramble without any significance without relating to anything in the chapter. The main character is the most annoying personality someone can read about, and the book had no real plot and jump from one subject to another. If you enjoy reading senseless plots and irritating characters this book is for you; if not than this book is not recommended to you.
B00008S2VG|3.0|First of all, I must say that I got suckered into purchasing the stupid limited ed. box pakaging of this effort. It is clumsy & overdone. I suggest getting  the crystal case version.<br />Now the music. Although she continues to produce decent work, I don't feel this one has enough of the fire and presence of any of her previous efforts.  Madonna is evolving, but she is treading difficult waters.  First of all, she seems to be trying to cover Bjork territory as she has on her last two efforts (Ray of Light & Music).  However, as much as I love her, she was never THAT deep.  Also, very few artists have been successful at creating music steeped in the electronica world without becoming cold sounding or dull.  Bjork, Massive Attack, Everything But The Girl, Echo - these are masters at combining electronica & pure energy well.  American Life is in a word lifeless in general. The lyrics are sometimes elementary and overly repetative.  Vocally, Madonna doesn't take risks like she did in Music & Ray which dissapoints. However, there are some cool moments:  The title tune is worth the purchase & the rap isn't bad at all.  It actually is reminiscent of Blondie's \\"Rature\\".  Hollywood haunts you long after it is over.  I'm So Stupid has to be the most fun dance song created since Ru Paul's \\"Supermodel\\". Love Profusion & Nothing Fails both need less repetition & more feeling.  Nobody Knows Me should be a hit single.  Such a funky jam - I almost expect to hear a Prince cameo (Keep that in mind for a re-mix, Madonna!!)  Intervention didn't interest me at all. X-static Process is probably the best songwriting on the project.  Really good song & singing.  Mother & Father works musically, but lyrically need re-working - the words remind me of Madonna of the 80's (which was great then, not if is was written at this point of her career).  Regardless of the status quo, I love  Die Another Day!!  Sorry!  Great song. Easy Ride - Again, musically is fine, but the lyrics aren't up to snuff - derivitive(sic). If you don't own a Madonna CD (difficult to believe!!), then AMERICAN LIFE won't sell you.  Start with either MUSIC, RAY OF LIGHT, MADONNA (the debut release), BEDTIME STORIES or TRUE BLUE.  If you want to hear a masterpiece (much underrated), pick up EROTICA.  Many still don't get how great that release was. That one still sounds fresh everytime I give it a spin!! I do hope Madonna will be more interesting (lyrically & vocally) next time.derivitive(sic). If you don't own a Madonna CD (difficult to believe!!), then AMERICAN LIFE won't sell you.

B00008DDSC|3.0|\\"Secretary\\" is an odd little sadomasochistic fantasy in which a lawyer and his secretary establish a kind of master/slave relationship in the office.<br />Lee Halloway is a deeply disturbed young woman who has just been released from a mental institution where she has been recuperating from a nervous breakdown.  Lee copes with her severely dysfunctional family - her father is an alcoholic who beats his wife, while her mother is a passive victim of abuse who overprotects her daughter - by cutting, gashing and burning herself regularly.  Now, back on the outside, Lee finds employment as secretary to a paralegal, E. Edward Grey, an equally neurotic man who turns out to be a full-blown \\"dominator\\" behind closed doors.  Together the two forge a bizarre sexual alliance so all-consuming in its nature that one wonders how this small office ever gets any work done at all.<br />Writer Erin Cressida Wilson and director Steven Shainberg have fun with the many ironies and paradoxes inherent in the offbeat world they are exploring.  For instance, Grey, by restricting Lee's freedom of choice, is actually liberating her by getting her to channel her self-abusive tendencies and desire for pain into a \\"healthier,\\" more \\"productive\\" direction.  Lee also discovers that men with unconventional sexual tastes may be no more willing to \\"settle down\\" and \\"commit\\" with a likeminded partner than many a man with more traditional sexual proclivities.<br />In many ways, \\"Secretary\\" turns out to be almost a recruiting poster for the sadomasochistic lifestyle.  The S&M scenes are kept relatively tame in tone and the film displays a wickedly funny sense of humor for most of its duration.  Moreover, the decidedly upbeat ending of the film could easily have garnished any Doris Day-Rock Hudson romantic comedy - had standards 40 years ago allowed them to explore this type of topic, that is.<br />As Lee and Grey, Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader turn in terrific performances.  They manage to capture the quirky nature of their respective characters without ever making them appear off-putting or grotesque.  Their performances go a long way towards purging the material of the kind of sleaziness and smarminess one might expect to find here.<br />The early scenes in the film may be a bit disturbing for some in the audience, mainly because we feel a bit like voyeurs ourselves peering in on the couple, almost as if they were zoo animals or subjects in some sort of psycho-sexual experiment.  But then, as we get to know the characters and come to like them, we become absorbed in their story and find ourselves actually cheering them on and wanting them to find some measure of meaning and happiness in their relationship and lives.<br />The makers of \\"Secretary\\" have taken a potentially \\"touchy\\" subject and injected it with warmth, humanity and insight.

B000069AUI|5.0|Like many people, I was too quick to write Coldplay off as Radiohead soundalikes when they first came into the music scene 2 years ago. \\"Yellow\\" seemed like mindless fluff, and I wasn't convinced -- that is, until I heard both this album and their previous 'Parachutes.' Coldplay are one of the hottest bands out there for a reason: They are amazing. And 'A Rush of Blood To The Head' justifies that. The singles ('In My Place,' 'Clocks' & 'The Scientist') alone are amazing enough to convince anyone to buy this CD, but the rest of the album is equally stellar. There is no filler on here. Just 54 minutes of beatiful, poetic and heartfelt music. Chris Martin writes the best lyrics, he's subtle, but easily relateable. I myself am very glad that I gave Coldplay a chance, and anyone who has their doubts should check into them. They truly are worthy of all the praise critics and music fans give them (unlike most of those worthless \\"The\\" bands). Definitely one of those cases where you should believe the hype. All music fans can appreciate this.
1558908420|4.0|I thought it would take years for Stallone to gain back my respect after making such ... as \\"Eye See You,\\" \\"Get Carter,\\" \\"Driven,\\" and \\"Avenging Angela,\\" but I've realized that popping my copy of \\"Cop Land\\" into my DVD player can stave off the disappointment for at least two hours. Stallone isn't impressive in the role, but he does it well, and that's a satisfying return to dramatic acting. Also present in the film are some of my favorite actors, including Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Harvey Keitel. Ray Liotta is perfect for the role, and the seemingly ever-present Michael Rappaport, who has a knack for popping up in movies with unexpectedly important roles, is enjoyable as usual. The story is easily followed from beginning to end with little interruption in thought process, which be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the viewer. Janeane Garafalo and Noah Emmerich (\\"Truman Show\\") play Stallone's deputies, both of whom don't have much play in the final third of the film. Action and drama blend well in this one, the story of a small town made up of mostly corrupt New York cops, with Stallone as the town's chief determined to prove he's a true policeman. This one is a definite recommendation.

So definitely I give 5 stars to this album.
0446310786|5.0|A small family consisting of a father, Atticus, and 2 children.  Scout and Jem Finch.  The family lives in Alabama during the depression, though Atticus is a rather well to-do lawyer while others are not so well off.  A new boy joins them, \\"Dill\\" Harris, and the kids enjoy their summer, playing games and whatnot.  They make up stories about Scout's neighbor, \\"Boo\\" Radley, a young shut-in who supposedly never ventured out of the house.  They find presents in a tree, which they are conviced that \\"Boo\\" has left for them. Scout and Jem attend a one room school in the fall, and Scout dislikes it immensely.  The next summer, the group of kids continue to play their games, and act out stories they've made up, especially about \\"Boo\\" Radley.  Meanwhile, Atticus has agreed to defend a poor, innocent black man who is accused of raping a white farmer's daughter.  Tom Robinson, the black man, represents the mockingbird in this book, a symbol of innocence destroyed by evil.<br /><BR><BR>\\"Remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. \\"Your father's right,\\" she said. \\"Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy ... but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.\\"<BR><BR><BR>Atticus provides powerful evidence that Tom Robinson was infact innocent, and that it was the girl's father who had injured her, not Tom Robinson.  Though the evidence against the white father was extensive, they all-white jury convicts Tom Robinson.  He later tries to escape from the prison, and is shot to death.  The children then must deal with their feelings of doubt in justice.<BR>Now, I won't give away too much more.  You'll have to read it, and find out what happens to Jem, Scout, Dill, \\"Boo\\" Radley, Atticus, and all the other amazing characters.  The book takes such a strong, and moving, stance against racial prejudice and an amazing depicition ofchildhood innocence.  It is an EXCELLENT read, and continues to be wonderful each and every time I read it.
0385504209|5.0|Just an overall amazing experience. I started and finished this book in a day. The book itself is exceptionally written. Even if it were a story with ideas and theories that are completely made up, it would still be great. However the fact that all the information in it is TRUE, makes it all that much better. Alot of hardcore Christians are screaming for this book's demise, but that would be beneficial to no one. I'll say it right now, that I would probably classify myself as one of those &quot;Hardcore Chrisitians,&quot; and yet I found this book just amazing. If anything, one of the messages of the book is the reinforcement of there being a God. It simply states that the Bible we read and the things we are taught represent those thoughts and ideas CHOSEN FOR US TO THINK, by people in power thousands of years ago. Example. Did you know there were originally some 80 gospels? Not just the four from Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John that we have been told? Before reading this book I was not aware of that at all. The question then is raised, what was in these other 70+ gospels, and why were they not chosen? As someone simply looking to find a good book, then this is an A+ all the way. More interesting codes and plot twists than i've ever seen before. For someone not sure if they wish to dive into this because of the author's questioning of certain aspects of one's faith, then all I can say is invest the time and judge for yourself. Coming from a strong believer of God, you owe it to yourself and to your creator one important thing.<br />To follow what you believe, not follow what you have been told.

Although significantly better on vinyl, this cannot get any better. my personal favorites are<BR> <BR>&quot;and your bird can sing&quot; -which makes me smile very time I hear it and shows the maturity and complexity the beatles have achieved since their early pop. these pure emotions makes revolver a true rock record, and the most influential.<br />&quot;I'm only sleeping&quot; swirling psychadelic song that everyone can relate to in the morning or at school on a bad day.<br />&quot;she said she said&quot; if you are good at analyzing the meanings of songs, this will certainly turn you on. <br />i hope this helps you, and I hope you enjoy it as much as i do!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Ya know, I've heard all sorts of different comments from all sorts of people and frankly I have to tell you that no matter waht the NY Times says about the album or how it may be her biggest flop in 20 years, this album is all good! Don't bother to read the critics analytical and self-conceived notions. This is an album you have to listen to yourself to really know wether or not you like it. I didn't like &quot;Music&quot;, but I think American Life is fantastic and each song is so good, especailly &quot;Love Profusion.&quot; It appears to be a rather personal effort on Madonna's part, especially if you listen to the lyrics enough. It's a very enjoyable album and by no means a flop in any sense of the word. And by the way, the only reason I can see there is an explicit version and a regualr version is that the &quot;f&quot; word appears in American life a few times, and that's it. Don't be fooled and think that the &quot;explicit&quot; label means something drastic. It's only for one song as far as I can tell.
0802130208|4.0|A Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole won the Pulitzer Prize and sold more than 1.5 million copies through more than 20 languages (Dunce). This book was published eleven years after the author's death by his mother and was the author's first book (Dunce). There is more than a humor in A Confederacy of Dunces. This book is typical American modern literature and contains many elements to be a good literature. Ignatius J. Reilly, a hero of this book, is a fool, but he thinks that other peoples except him are fools. As the title infers, it is the confederacy of dunces. Who's right? There is no answer. It is the way it is; an answer follows the numbers in modern society. <BR>Ignatius J. Reilly lives with his mamma even though he's already in his age of thirty. He spends most of the day writing a book locked in his room. Ignatius is a fool in this book. Even though he has doctor's degree and graduated from college, he is a fool. What is the standard of stupid and genius?  If one is not fit in the society, he can be regarded as a fool like Ignatius. The people who is unique or fools as people say, are the brave people who start something different before the ordinary men. The man who first asserted that the earth was spinning was called a fool. The man who first walked by two legs was considered to a fool. One who quitted one's business, who left school, who started a new business were all called fools and pointed with scorn. The author titled his book A Confederacy of Dunces not A Dunce of Confederacy. Who are the dunces? What if this book is read few decades later? Is Ignatius going to be still regarded as a fool? The author approaches to the readers with a very deep subject. A Confederacy of Dunces is a great novel. Even though there is not much happenings and exciting in it, it has humor and makes readers keep think.Ignatius is a unique character. He is a hero of this book, but he has too many handicaps to be a hero. He doesn't have any good side in a word. This book is a satire of this world. According to the introduction of this book in the backside, Ignatius is a later-day Don Quixote. My uncle has invited to read the Don Quixote to me, saying whenever he spent hard times and when he failed something, he read the Don Quixote and was encouraged by reading it. That is now understandable.
6304007523|5.0|In many ways ROCKY reminds me very much of MARTY. Both movies are about bachelors of Italian descent who are perceived as underdogs. Both men are stuck in a rut leading aimless lives mostly confined to their own ethnic neighborhoods. Marty lives in the Bronx and Rocky in Philadelphia. Both are saved by luck and above all by love which suddenly gives them new hope and purpose.<br />ROCKY received Oscars for Best Picture, Director (John G. Avildsen) and Editing. It also was nominated for Best Actor (Sylvestor Stallone), Best Actress (Talia Shire), Best Supporting Actor (Burgess Meredith and Burt Young), Story, Screenplay, Song and Sound.<br />The big competition for awards in 1976 came from NETWORK with Peter Finch, Faye Dunaway, William Holden and Ned Beatty. It was ROCKY, however, which stood the test of time and became permanently fixed in the public consciousness.
0385504209|1.0|Whatever you do, don't think!<br />Dan Brown writes a speedy thriller that could keep you up all night turning pages.  This is the best thing that can be said about this book.  It's best to read it when your mind isn't sharp.<br />In the beginning you may overlook the fact that the author has placed a flamboyant homosexual in the Grand Mastery of a goddess worshipping group that supposedly finds completion and enlightenment in heterosexual union.<br />You may also overlook the fact that the only character described in any detail at all is the huge albino assassin following a plethora of other albino assassin stories from Foul Play to Pluto Nash (any more albino assassin stories and albinos will start an anti-defamation league).  The rest are faceless cutouts.  Even the main character gets a one line description.<br />The book is full of puzzles, but the best of these are the anagrams.  The rest are often totally fabricated or contradictory (such as the one where we first note that hebrew has no vowels, and then get the puzzle to work out by adding vowels).<br />Try not to notice that until the last few pages, there is only a single female character with more than half a dozen lines.  She seems to exist for the sake of the mentally superior male characters who spend most of the book lecturing her.  As a cryptographer, her only other contribution is the ability to recognize a Fibonacci series.<br />The biggest thing to overlook is the portrayals of any faith/religion at all.  The author shows a lack of any depth in understanding either goddess worship (in which he simultaneously asserts that male and female are equal complements, and asserts that the female is greater) or Christianity (in which he seems to assume that Christianity has some concern with the gender of God except in metaphors).  Try not to think about what Christian sect the author may have had contact with that bases its beliefs or it's efforts on finding the Holy Grail.  Try to overlook the fact that if Jesus wasn't who the Bible claims him to be, any of his brothers would have the same claims of inheritance.<br />What begins as a mystery soon becomes alternate-universe science-fiction as Mr. Brown rewrites history, religion, linguistics and logic.<br />What could have been a thriller worthy of Alfred Hitchcock ends as a conspiracy sermon worthy of Richard Hoagland and Art Bell and a puzzle of whether this is in actuality a defense of the author's sexuality.'t who the Bible claims him to be, any of his brothers would have the same claims of inheritance.<BR>What begins as a mystery soon becomes alternate-universe science-fiction as Mr. Brown rewrites history, religion, linguistics and logic.<BR>What could have been a thriller worthy of Alfred Hitchcock ends as a conspiracy sermon worthy of Richard Hoagland and Art Bell and a puzzle of whether this is in actuality a defense of the author's sexuality.
0385504209|5.0|This was my first time to read a work of Dan Brown's and I have to admit that I am impressed.<br />I picked up The DaVinci Code on the premise that it was a sort of historical mystery novel in the vein of Wilbur Smith's \\"The Seventh Scroll\\" which I thoroughly enjoyed.<br />While a good number of people would question the accuracy of Brown's information with regard to the Grail, Opus Dei, the Priory of Sion, Mary Magdalene and other religious content, I merely took this as a work of fiction loosely grounded on some facts.<br />Doing that, I have to say that Dan Brown makes the book almost impossible to put down. The character of Robert Langdon is compelling and has a lot of potential to carry off a series of books with him in the lead.<br />The way Brown dangles clues and mysteries without giving them away immediately contributes to the building of a suspenseful atmosphere. It makes one anxious to flip pages to get to the answers. In my opinion, that makes a great book.<br />I heartily recommend this book for those interested in historical fiction. But devout Catholics (like me) beware, one really has to approach this book with a lot of open-mindedness and understanding.
B000000W6R|4.0|While Pisces Iscariot doesn't manage to create the same incredible atmosphere of scale and theatre as did Siamese Dream or Mellen Collie and the Infinite Sadness, it is worth owning, if only to only to own two tracks:<br />1. A cover of Fleetwood Mac's Landslide, which (unlike the recent Dixie Chicks' cover) actually eclipses the original in terms of both emotion and simplicity (Billie Corgan's protean voice is able to assume the role much more effectively than was Stevie Nicks'), and<br />2. Obscured, a sleeper of a track, but a beautiful one at that, and one of the Pumpkins' most haunting (and most peaceful and zen-like) tracks ever.<br />Of course, the rest of the disc is good, if not quite as great, and as you might expect, the whole streaks ahead of the current crop of &quot;pop&quot; artists without having to break so much as a tiny sweat.<br />If you're a Pumpkins fan and don't already own it, shame on you!<br />If you're not an obsessive Pumpkins fan, buy it anyway, even though you may not have heard much about it. You'll likely be pleasantly surprised!
B000002UAU|5.0|An undeniable masterpiece, The Beatles eighth proper album (in five short years) is an artistic landmark and something that every person should experience at least once. It's the grand extension of their previous album, Revolver; and it owes much of its inspiration to the brilliant Pet Sounds (by the Beach Boys.)  Among critics these three albums are most often considered the &quot;best of all time.\\"  Which is truly the best is one of the most contested debates in rock music.  There is room for all three, but I feel this is the best.  <br />The concept of Sgt. Peppers is famous; The Beatles, tired of the weight that came with their reputation, decided that in this album they would pretend to be another band.  The album was supposed to be a concert set that the &quot;Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; might play.  Actually the concept is only followed loosely (though it did inspire the most fascinating album cover ever.)  Still, this supposed concept underlies one of the main themes of Sgt. Peppers, which is that the songs are concerned with day-to-day observations on life rather than introspection.  Sometimes, the lyrics tell a great story, or produce terrific images.  But often the music evokes feelings that the lyrics don't match, as sometimes they are complete nonsense.  As other critics have noted, this is sometimes a drawback; but the music more than makes up for this...<br />The title track is one of the greatest openings ever, complete with the backing symphony warming up and an anticipatory audience.  McCartney's searing vocals provide the perfect edge to this killer rock tune, and the backing symphony fuses with the sound seamlessly.  This fusion of different musical styles permeates the record, and is part of what makes it so ground breaking and timeless.  She's Leaving Home, a thoughtful song about a runaway girl, is completely done with a chamber music strings section like Eleanor Rigby, only more beautiful.  Fixing a Hole is another great McCartney song, this time with a harpsichord.  Almost every song on the album was conceived with instruments never before used in rock before.  But the real genius of The Beatles is that these additions never feel forced; when you listen to the album you can't imagine a better way to do any of the songs.<br />The music is truly timeless.  Even after all these years, the intricate melodies and progression of these songs sounds refreshing and inventive.  This was the first album to ever have one track flow straight into the next.   It gives the feel that this is more than just a collection of singles; it is an artistic statement that belongs together.  No other band could have so effortlessly placed McCartney's 30's tribute (with a great bass and clarinet line, and some delightfully whimsical if silly lyrics) after the sitar-laced, trance-like Within You Without You (which is a very minor Harrison contribution, seeing as his similar &quot;Love You To&quot; on Revolver is a better song.)  This cohesion is much more noticeable if you listen to the first half in the order described in the liner notes; the Beatles had intended a different song progression than what resulted (only because the album format couldn't support a \\"Side A\\" that ran the first seven songs.)  <br />The classic With a Little Help From My Friends is the only song on the album that John and Paul actually worked out lyrically together.  Altogether, Paul deserves most of the credit for Sgt. Pepper's execution, as he came up with the concept, was most interested in the final result and wrote 8.5 out of 13 of the songs (the half coming from his part of A Day in the Life.)  Lennon's contributions were integral, but he was somewhat removed from his peak songwriting.  At the time, he had been somewhat depressed, and his lyrics suggest a lack of effort: Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, one of the best psychedelic songs both sonically and lyrically was inspired by his kids' (Sean) drawing; Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite, a verypeculiar carnival-sounding song had it's lyrics copied verbatim from an old poster; A Day in the Life's nonsense lyrics were based on newspaper clippings (even though I think they're some of the most evocative Lennon's ever penned.)  The irresistible, ragged Good Morning, Good Morning was written about a day's errands, but does comment on the monotony of living day to day.  <br />This isn't to say that Lennon was in a slump; songs this good couldn't ever be considered a slump, even by his lofty standards.  But Sgt. Peppers was the first Beatles album that McCartney clearly directed, and he would continue to do so from this point on.  In the earlier records John was generally more of a leader but by this point he had already detached himself from the group to some extent.<br />The coupe de grace of the album belongs to Lennon, however.  A Day in the Life is might just be the greatest song ever written.  It's a bewildering musical achievement, and officially heralded the arrival of studio songcraft.  It begins with a simple, haunting four-piece melody and some piano chords, and builds to a glorious full-stringed climax- which releases with a most transcendent, sustained chord.  Lennon delivers his lyrics about the human tragedies we all read about everyday with an aching and stunned voice, as if numbed by the sadness of modern life.  This is accentuated, in typical Beatles fashion, by McCartney's mid-song bit about going through the motions of another day as normal, completely unaffected by the injustice that surrounds him.  It's a simply mind-blowing song.<br />Revolver may have had better lyrics than Sgt. Peppers, but Sgt. Pepper sonic assault is both more varied and more assured.  This album changed all the rules about what rock music was, what it could mean to people and where music was going.  There may be albums that are its equal, but no one has ever done music better than The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I just watched The Bourne Identity last night.  I did like the movie.  However, even though it has been a long while since I read the book (and the two Bourne books following the first), I do suggest to anybody who liked the movie, please read the book.  While I like Matt Damon a lot, he is just a little young to have played Jason Bourne.  Richard Chamberlain in the original movie fit the part a bit better.  Don't get me wrong--this movie is pretty good.  It's just that the book is much better.  Try it!

Well he succeeded!!
B000001EPB|5.0|Being an Irish dancer, I have a deeper appreciation of Irish music than most other people in the United States and the world. A lot of people I know cannot stand to hear even one minute of Irish music. All of my friends and myself find this CD the best compilation of Irish music I have ever heard, even my sister who despises Irish dance. There are deep, beautiful songs, uplifting songs and even rock songs with a bit of Irish music. The CD was cleverly put together, even with the special feature of dancers dancing in the shows on the last two songs.<BR>This CD is great because it is not just Irish music, but a little bit of everything, appealing to everyone. It was worth every penny; I love Lord of the Dance!!!!
B00008WG3U|2.0|OK kids, this album is nice, but nothing more, the lyrics, like everybody has just said are great but the music....   This is medio-core, the only stand-outs  are We got two jealous and Reagaining Unconsciousness. Oh, once a guy called Fat Mike told and sung &quot;we don't play ska anymore&quot;, well what's about anarchy camp???? That trumpet seems a sample of Sapore di mare, an italian song from the 60's. Embarassing. But in the end, what can I say, also the boring music is done with style, and nofx does it, probably because their music is in my heart..so....LET's HOPE FOR A BETTER FUTURE or just look to a great PAST.
0804106304|5.0|The Joy Luck   Club is about four women who started a club. They named it the Joy Luck Club to celebrate their good fortune. They tell stories that happened to them when they were young and about their daughters and their lives. It also has a lot to do with the Chinese customs and beliefs. The main characters were Jing-Mei Woo and Waverly Jong. When Jing-Mei Woo was young she played the piano, as she grew older her mother passed away and she took her spot in the Joy Luck Club. After her mother passed away she travels to China with her father to meet her sisters. In her own way she makes her mothers wish come true by going to China to see her sisters. When Waverly was young she played chess and competed in championships to become the champion of little China. As she grew older her mother wasn't satisfied with any of the men she was with unless they were Chinese. She was trying to get her mother to accept Rich, the man she was going to marry. For their honeymoon, they are going to China, but she is scared that if she goes they won't let her return to America. Her mother tells her they will know she is American by the way she carries herself and that they can see it in her face that she is Americanized.<BR> My favorite character was Waverly Jong because she was smart, funny, hard working, strong, and she knows what she wants in life. I enjoyed reading this book and learned a lot about the Chinese customs and cultures. My favorite part of this book is when Rose tells her husband that she is divorcing him, and that she will be keeping the house. My least favorite part of this book was the part when the nurses asked Ying-Ying St. Clair \\"What should we do with this lifeless baby?\\" Ying-Ying hurled a newspaper at them and told them \\"Wrap it up like a fish and throw it in the lake.\\" If I could change one thing about this story it would be my least favorite part of this book, I would have her keep her baby and not treat it like a fish.<BR>I would highly recommend this book toanother person. It didn't get boring and it has a good plot. It mixes tenderness and bitter irony, sorrow and slicing wit. Anyone who wants to learn a little bit more about the Chinese culture should definitely read this book.

0689859368|5.0|The Spiderwick Chronicles Book 1, written by Holly Black and illustrated by Tony DiTerlizzi, should do nicely for fans of  Lemony Snicket who are looking for something new to read. The story concerns three children who go to live in a house inhabited by faeries after the children's parents have divorced. However these faeries are the real kind; mischievous, troublesome and sometimes violent. Not to worry though, everything works out fine once the children learn to understand the ways of the faeries. This first book entitled \\"The Field Guide\\"  is about how the children discover the faeries and a book called \\"Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You.\\" This book is just what it implies, a guide to the faeries. The writing is wonderful but the real reason to buy The Spiderwick Chronicles is for the illustrations by Tony DiTerlizzi. If you aren't already familiar with his work in books ...then you are in for a real treat. Mr. DiTerlizzi's work  is jaw droppingly brilliant. I highly recommend The Spiderwick Chronicles.<br />...
0316666343|1.0|This is a classic illustration of a failed work. The book should be mandatory reading at writer's wrokshops, for it teaches that a facility for writing pretty sentences does not imply an equal facility in creating a readable (never mind great) novel; just as a superb skill in laying bricks does not endow the bricklayer with the capacity to design and build a house.<br />The first couple of chapters of THE LOVELY BONES are not only readable, but exciting and fine; but soon the reader is dragged through a shapeless, pretentious, and silly meandering that leads to a bland and pointless finale; all along, however, encountering gracious and often gorgeous sentences. Central to the book is the image of a large sinkhole that swallows cars and refrigerators and a safe that contains the bones of the title. Well, not all the bones of the title but most of them. In a way the book itself becomes a sinkhole into which hours of our time and attention are sucked up in a muck of decaying cliches, simplemindedness, and pretentiousness.<br />Perhaps a strong editor (was any kind of an editor involved in this production?) could have cut through the self-indulgence and imposed on the writer the discipline needed to produce a fine novel. As it stands, THE LOVELY BONES is a most unsatisfactory reading experience.

He takes you into the story right out of the gate.  And the story gets better with each turn of the page, at each turn of event.

0385504209|4.0|Mrs. White did it with the candlestick in the dining room. Or did Professor Plum do it with the knife in the observatory? Sorry to start out with a &quot;Clue&quot; analogy but if you aren't prepared for a serious brain twister, you had better choose another book to read.<br />This was my first Dan Brown book.  On one hand, I can tell you that it will not be the last time I read one of his books.  On the other hand, I can also tell you that, while I hung onto every page, the book left me a little empty.<br />The Good:  Dan Brown had me captivated from the very first few pages and the book turned out to be a real page turner.  Brown's story challenges the very foundation of Christianity in a very unabashed fashion, spinning a complex yarn that, to me, seemed plausible.  Brown bravely stays true to his storyline knowing that many Christians and certainly most Catholics will throw the book down in disgust less than a third of the way through on general principle.<br />The book really, really makes you think.  Several times, I paused long enough to access the internet and look up a print of a Da Vinci painting to see exactly what Brown refered to.  The storyline was incredibly interesting and stimulating.<br />The bad:  I would have liked to have seen Brown turn more of a critical eye to the Priory, using his characters to communicate a Christian position to many of the assertions concerning the role of Mary Magdelene in biblical history. Instead, Brown's storyline simply portrays the Catholic Church as a narrow-minded, book-burning political machine that shaped Christianity for their own personal reasons.<br />The Ugly: While the book was riveting throughout, the climax (no pun intended) was very underwhelming - not at all the enlightening ending I was expecting.  The ending sort of reminded me of the song, &quot;One Tin Soldier&quot;, where wars are waged over the discovery of a message, which turned out to be relatively simple instead of profound.<br />All in all, I really enjoyed the book. CAUTION: if you are a devout Christian who believes that the New Testament as we know it today was divinely inspired and 100% literal, don't waste your time. It will only make you angry.really enjoyed the book.

B00008S2VG|4.0|I really really liked this album. Maybe not as soulfull as &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; but still a very catchy album. I feel that, as with every other album, Madonna really put a lot of emotion in this album. Madonna is all about change and not every album from here on out is going to be another &quot;ray of light&quot; . Every album has it's own unique sound. I think this album is really good despite negative reviews. I highly recommend &quot;American Life&quot;.
B00008S2VG|5.0|So far all I have heard is negative feedback re American Life.  However, I think it is great.  Madonna is obviously trying to grow with the times and her age.  Clearly, she would look foolish if she were still recording corny songs like her long ago hit &quot;Like a Virgin.&quot;  My favorite recording remains Bedtime Stories, however I think Ray of Light is superb.  Music is not my favorite CD, I'm not sure why, just doesn't thrill me and rarely listen to it.  That being said there are a few songs that I do like.  American Life is different somehow and I recommend it.  If you don't like it trade it in.  Anyway, if you don't like Madonna then don't buy what she records.  It really is that simple.    <br />Oddly enough, I spent years thinking of as nothing but a shallow individual with nothing better to do than exploit herself and record fluff although sometimes the fluff wasn't too bad and some of her songs will and are classics of pop culture.  Now, however I realize there is so much more to her.  Go Madonna, and keep on changing.  American Life is good and worth buying particularly if you want to experience another level to Madonna's ever evolving style.
B00008WG3U|1.0|I'm not sure what the other reviewers on this page are hearing, but this is by far the worst NOFX release in the El Hefe era. NOFX's political consciousness is nothing new. Every album they've ever released has had a balance of political and social commentary with a healthy mix of humor and sarcasm. These elements were mixed beautifully from \\"The Longest Line\\" EP all the way through \\"The Decline\\" with four superb albums in between. And then the downward spiral began wih the forgettable \\"Pump Up the Valuum\\" and hit rock bottom with this lastest flop. Fat Mike has made an obvious effort to not obscure any of his political views on this album. The problem he runs into is that without using his normal meathod of suggesting his views through creative metaphors, we discover that he really has nothing that profound to say. Simply claiming \\"The idiots are taking over\\" does not make you a great political thinker, and citing people like Michael Moore (who's been exposed for more than fabricating most of his \\"documentaries\\") does not help his cause. However, none of this points out the real flaws in this album. The songs are simply bad. The lyrics and vocal melodies sound akward and forced during most of the album, and the song structures are among the least creative this band has put to tape. In \\"The Separation of Church and Skate,\\" Mike attacks modern punk bands for being too \\"safe\\" yet he takes no real risks on this album himself. \\"Medio-core\\" is another song critical of modern music that really just has him eating his words yet again. \\"Regaining Unconsciousness\\", \\"The Idiots are Taking Over\\" and \\"Franco Un-American\\" are supposedly what make up the central theme of this album, but offer no new ideas or solutions to any of the problems they attempt to address. In the end they come off sounding as profound as Sum 41 claiming how they don't \\"want to be another casualty of society\\".  Sadly, Fat Mike has also seemed to lose his once sharp wit. \\"She's Nubs\\" doesn't raise a chuckle and \\"Anarchy Camp\\" is painful to listen to. \\"13 Stiches\\" and \\"We've Got Two Jealous Agains\\" are simply Mike boasting his punk rock cred and by the time you get to the somber closer \\"Oops I O.D.'d\\" you simply don't care anymore. <br />Its incredibly sad that a band who as recently as two years ago wrote a masterpiece like \\"The Decline\\" have written such an uninspired album. I saw them last week in L.A. and Fat Mike admitted that the album had \\"only one decent song\\". You would think that if he were serious about getting his political message to be taken seriously, he would have made more of an effort to put out the kind of brilliant music we all know he and his mates are capable of. There is no excuse for this other than laziness.
0393316041|5.0|I just pulled Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman off my bookshelf for the first time in more than a year, and was immediately reminded of what an unusual, hilarious, compelling and intelligent book it is. I took it down for a friend to borrow, but before I would let it out of the house, I found time to re-re-read odd pages and passages, followed, of course, by a fair share of laughing out loud and shaking my head in wonder.<br />The book isn't a biography as much as it is a simple collection of anecdotes. But when the anecdotes come from somebody with the story telling ability, the smarts and the optimism of Mr. Feynman, then that is plenty.<br />To be fair, each time I re-read the book, it seems a little more dated -- not in the charming sense of old-fashioned values like wearing your best suit for a Sunday afternoon stroll and saving love letters in a box tied together by twine, but in the sense of context. We have to remember, for example, that the price Mr. Feynman paid for a bottle of champagne at one point would be a small fortune if it were stated in today's dollars, and that traveling from New York to Los Angeles was not something one could do on a moment's notice, as it is today. More seriously, Mr. Feynman's treatment of women -- as objects to be conquered and as the gender that \\"owes\\" men something in return for a couple of drinks or a dinner -- will today seem politically incorrect to people who dwell on those things.<br />But there is too much great stuff between the book's covers to let those kinds of minor problems stand in the way.<br />Of all the qualities Mr. Feynman shares about himself on the book's pages, the one that I like the most is his child-like curiosity: he seems to want to know everything how every thing works. Friends tell me I'm a bit like that myself and when I first made that connection I wondered if it was one of the reasons I was so enthralled by Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman -- and its follow-up, What Do You Care What Other People Think? -- starting from the moment I first picked it up and clear through many re-readings and many more years.

B000060K4O|5.0|You know a comedy film like this  is a classic when you can walk up to people and essentially quote it's most esoteric errata, such as:<br />\\"Would you like some coffee?\\"<BR>\\"Would I\\"<BR>\\"Yes, have some.\\"<BR>\\"Yes, have some!!\\"<br />Without even knowing which characters are speaking which line, it's still silly and funny as hell...  and the lines from \\"Ghostbusters\\" (an especially well written script) create many bonding moments between those in the know...  much like \\"Stripes\\" and \\"Caddyshack\\" this one's a comedy classic that remains as funny as the day it was released.<br />Oh, and the special effects still work... before cgi jaded our senses, it took good ol' foam latex to make many of these creatures come alive (with a dose of good ol' rotoscoping).  The entire tech team for this film were masters of their craft.<br />Highly recommended.
B00005JLRT|5.0|There has been a feeling among fans of Star Trek movies that the even-numbered movies have been much better than the odd-numbered ones.  While all of them have been fun to watch, this theory had been more or less true until the 9th movie, \\"Star Trek: Insurrection\\", which broke the theory with a great movie.  \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" makes it 2 in a row.  <br />\\"Nemesis\\" comes after a 4 year drought in movies, but the wait was certainly worth it after watching it.  The movie gives Star Trek fans something they've wanted to see for a long time in Will Riker finally marrying Deanna Troi - a relationship that was re-kindled in \\"Insurrection\\".  The movie also gives fans a glimpse into the Romulan Empire, (especially the planet Remus, first mentioned in the original series) something that has not been explored as deeply as the Borg or Klingons.  The DVD version will be a bigger treat for the fans, as it includes many scenes (including all of actor's Steven Culp) that ended up on the cutting room floor prior to release.  These scenes add to the overall dimension of the story, which may have blunted some criticism of the movie, had they been left in.<br />That is where the movie for fans ends & the movie for the rest of the public begins.  You don't have to be a fan of Star Trek to enjoy the action scenes as the Enterprise fights for survival.  But the real heart of this movie boils down to a simple question that any of us can ask ourselves:  What kind of person would we be today, if we lived & grew up under completely different circumstances?  Would we act the same, think the same? Is each person born with a pre-determined destiny, that no matter what, they will turn out a certain way?   Or is it simply that each of us starts out like a lump of clay and is molded by the environment in which we are raised in??<br />The original Star Trek was popular because of its ability to be very thought-provoking, yet entertaining us at the same time.  \\"Star Trek: Nemesis\\" follows that sametradition, beautifully!!
0156027321|5.0|This book was such a pleasure to read; every metaphor was so spot on, that the ideas rolled around in my brain, lighting up the neurons until the next metaphor came and, like a new wave falling on a crowded beach, overtook the previous.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I believe there may be some sort of law against not having seen this movie.  For your own sake, I would suggest watching it immediately, just in case.<br />Aliens is a rare breed of movie -- lots of action, great characters, a menacing enemy, all pulled off extremely well.  While Starship Troopers watered itself down with some obviously irrelevant romance scenes, We Were Soldiers goes through pains to show you the effect of a war at home and so many other action movies focus on just one cheesy lead character, Aliens is like a good old fashioned war movie.  There's marines with machine guns (and plenty of personality), there's lots of vicious, nasty aliens, there's award winning special effects, what more could you want?<br />Aliens is the perfect example of action sci-fi done right.  It pains me that there are really no other movies up to spec in this catagory.
B00005JLRT|5.0|As for NEMESIS, I am going out on a limb here and going to state that even though the film is highly derivative from previous Trek films, it is by far the most rousing, kinetic and engrossing of all the TNG movies to date (hand to hand combat, phaser firing in corridors, space battles). It is miles ahead of FIRST CONTACT.<br />From the opening of film, with the reversed \\"Star Trek\\" title on the screen to the climactic 4 ship battle, this film delivered the goods. It is the most action-packed of all the Trek films, including the TOS films and the special effects, mostly, are quite impressive. For once, the film LOOKS like it was made for the big screen, although more use of exterior, non-ship locales would have added another dimension.<br />The film listed at 116 minutes, the film moved quite briskly, and I had a great time watching it, relishing every minute, every snippet of dialogue, every bit of throwaway humor (which thankfully this time, is not forced). I was sorry to see it end. <br />All the regulars especially Patrick Stewart, this time giving a more emotional, more layered performance, is wonderful. The chemistry between Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis is great, and, contrary to what you may have heard, Worf is not reduced to a \\"drunken reservation Indian\\" (as referred to by prominent an online reviewer). He has a brief drunk, but quiet scene at the wedding, and his bad lines in the original script (\\"Well Romulan ale should be more illegal\\") are nowhere to be seen in the film.<br />I am not going to focus on the smashing biological-like attack on the Senate, the THREE KINGS-like desert chase, Data's rescue of Picard from \\"The Scorpion,\\" Troi's 'remember me' scene and the final, beautifully shot, edited and scored battle involving four ships. I love those scenes but there are other very enjoyable albeit more subtle ones in NEMESIS. <br />There are some gems prevalent in NEMESIS, including an introductory sequence with Shinzon and his henchman the Viceroy coming down those steps, in the dimly lit room, was very atmospheric. Shinzon walks down quietly, like a hungry predator, examining the crew, notably especially Troi and Picard, while a stern Ryker looks on uncomfortably. I loved the darkness of that scene, both in image and in subtext.<br />Another effective scenes features Picard's dinner with Shinzon, in a room off the Senate (a room which looks suspiciously medieval somehow) the sequences with the child are introduced but they are shot in hazy, blue monochrome (aided by a nice f/x shot of a pan into the mines). It is an effective scene but Stuart Baird does not wallow in it, so as not to give too unnecessary sympathy to Shinzon. <br />For fans, like myself in the past, who always complained about the Picard-Data focus in the movies, Data has quite a lesser role in this film, as opposed to the previous ones. A memorable sequence features Data attempting to explain to B-4 (an android) why he has to turn him off (after the former downloads the ship's classified data banks). Brent Spiner - in ineffective yellow pancake makeup amplified by the large-screen - is annoyed at B-4 but not angry; he takes on the role of the older sibling who disapproves of the actions of the younger one, but just when you think you see an element of anger in Data, he calls B-4 \\"brother.\\" The term \\"brother\\" coming from Data means he has come full circle. In a way he is looking at himself from \\"Encounter at Farpoint\\" and is now acting like the human he is not. I am not a fan of Data in general but loved the endearing, warm quality to that scene. <br />For the first time in a TNG movie we also get an effective, ready room sequence where the Captain and his crew discuss Shinzon, and reunite again in it for a farewell toast to dead colleague.<br />I loved the dark orange look of the interior of the space ship (the dark red doors, the panels etc) as well as the background graphics on the monitors and various screens across the ship. Indeed. Mathew Leonetti's (MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, TOP GUN) cinematography is excellent, especially considering the confines of the ship. <br />The Jerry Goldsmith score, somehow was much more effective onscreen with the action, than I remember it being when I heard it on the CD. Ultimately, it is one of his better TNG scores, and his ST: TMP fanfare at space dock, in the end, almost brought tears to my eyes - it's like all the ST movies had come full circle, beginning and ending in space dock. <br />I love this film.
0802130208|1.0|Book Review: A Confederacy of Dunces<br /> John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces is a story about a thirty year old guy (Ignatius Reilly) who lives with his mother in New Orleans. Ignatius is an over weight, unsanitary, selfish, couch potato, who increasingly clash's with his mother throughout the book. <BR>Ignatius went to college and he also has a master's degree. But for some reason he is thirty and still lives with his mother. He either sits at home watching and criticizing the T. V., goes to the movies and criticizes the film out loud, eats, or locks himself in his room writing on scattered pieces of paper. He had been pampered by his mother which contributed to the way he is, but then their financial situation goes south and Ignatius has to get a job. He tries to weasel his way out of it but he ends up at a job at Levy Pant Company as a filer, but he just throws the files away because he is to lazy to actually file. He gets fired when he tries to get the factory workers to have an uprising, and then ends up as a hot dog vendor. As a vendor he just eats hot dogs al day and doesn't really try to sell the hot dogs. As the book caries on more tension grows between Ignatius and his mother because she can't bare how selfish and lazy he is, and she starts to think about having him committed. Ignatius then try's to start a gay political party and it just completely fails. Then his mother finally commits him but he escapes and the book comes to an abrupt ends. Ignatius finally ends leaving his mother but it is do to his lethargy.
B000002JSV|5.0|I'm not sure why people often claim that this record is inferior to others. AC/DC has always tried to do different things on different records. After the super hard-driving rock of 1977's Let There Be Rock, the band decided to make a record that showcased their roots in the blues - and they succeeded wonderfully!  More than any other &quot;hard-rock&quot; or &quot;metal&quot; band, AC/DC has always been about the blues roots of Rock &amp; Roll. Powerage represents AC/DC at its purest. It is a fantastic record that is right up there alongside Back in Black, Highway to Hell, and Let There Be Rock.
B000088E6D|5.0|Perhaps &quot;delicious&quot; is an odd adjective to describe a CD but it just seems to fit perfectly for this fabulous debut by Michael Buble. His voice is honey smooth and his enthusiasm is infectious. His singing just makes me want to dance and snap my fingers. Buble has proven here that he is the newest member of an exclusive group of singers that includes such legends as Sinatra and Martin. I honestly don't think anyone could ever be disappointed after listening to this - highly recommended!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, here, so you should expect as much on his sophomore release.  <br />Jack doesn't deviate too much from 'Brushfire Fairytales' and uses pretty much the same formula although 'On and On' seems to have a bit more 'funk' influence.<br />While many will try and chastise JJ for re-hashing much of the same stuff which we found on 'Fairytales, I say, &quot;HURRAH!&quot;  Dude, BF rocked, and this does too!<br />Indeed, if it ain't broke don't try and fix it!!
B000002KCC|5.0|Most people will have heard of Neil Young in some context. Cliched terms like \\"godfather of grunge\\" are thrown around often. A brief history lesson will tell you how Neil Young shot to moderate fame a s a member of Buffalo Springfield in the 60's. His solo career didn't gain commercial success until he was recruited to join Crosby, Stills and Nash on the album Deja Vu. His commercial zenith was then reached with the album Harvest. However, it was only after a series of personal upheavals that he released three uncharacteristic albums (On the Beach, Time Fades Away and Tonights The Night) that divided fans and critics that he created his most grounbreaking and appealing works. Tonight's the Night is the embodiment of a wake in an album. His enigmatic Crazy Horse collaborator Danny Whitten died from a heroin overdose, as did roadie Bruce Berry. I won't give analsyes of every song - but i'll merely say that the songs are tequila-fueled, beautiful and honest. Many will identify it as Neil's best (although I beleive that honour belongs to On the Beach). If you have any interst in Neil Young and have not heard this album - I strongly suggest you make every effort to get a copy.
B00004Z459|4.0|First things first - this is not a nu-metal album. Rather, it's a collection of fine rock songs, refracted through classic pop, hip-hop, alt-metal, emocore and almost any other genre of popular music that you could think of.<br />Linkin Park are clearly better than most of the other bands they get compared to. Unlike too many of the current US bands, they operate using both melody and emotion. That's REAL emotion, by the way, not the synthetic anger manufactured by cynical record companies wanting to sell records to alienated teenagers. You see, while Fred Durst likes singing about rolling and trying to cram 46 f-words into one song, Linkin Park are interested in your fears and insecurities, your broken relationships, your darkness, the things that keep you awake at night. And, for the most part, they deal with these things in a mature, genuinely emotive way.<br />The storming opener Papercut starts with a syncopated drumbeat and breaks into a swirl of guitars, with Mike Shinoda rapping about paranoia over the top. There's no denying the power of the bridge section when Chester Bennington sings, \\"The sun goes down/I feel the light betray me.\\"<br />First single One Step Closer highlights LP's best weapon - the way in which the double-barrelled vocal assault of Shinoda and Bennington makes a song scream with tension and passion; they complement each other perfectly.<br />With You contains the album's first real melody of note, as well as the first example of the band's ability to create a genuinely atmospheric soundscape over which Shinoda raps in a more chilled-out way than in other songs. The chorus soars beautifully, and Bennington injects the line \\"I'm with you\\" with much more conviction than Avril Lavigne could possibly manage.<br />Crawling was the single that made me buy the album two years ago. The way Chester Bennington sang about his insecurity had a monumental impact on me, almost as if it was about my own insecurities. It still sounds fantastic, with its stark, haunting verse breaking into a chorus so blistering yet melodic that it could rip paint off walls. Turn it up very, very loud and scream/cry along.<br />Runaway is really atmospheric, with one of the best lyrics on the album, \\"Paper bags and angry voices/Under a sky of dust\\". Bennington is, however, prone to some awful metal-screaming moments, where he actually sounds like he could be in one of those horrific bands like Disturbed or Murderdolls that you see on Kerrang TV. He has one on Runaway and one on By Myself (and in fact he has one on new single Faint from Meteora). Someone ought to tell him how damn off-putting it is.<br />Even the massive radio/TV overplaying of UK top ten hit In The End can't hide its sheer gorgeousness. Shinoda's rapping sounds more fluent than anywhere else, the piano line is simply beautiful, the lyrics are as good as any on the album (\\"Watch it count down to the end of the day/The clock ticks life away/It's so unreal\\"), and the guitar harmonies are brilliant.<br />A small handful of tracks (Points of Authority, the slightly Eastern-sounding A Place For My Head and the slightly lame hip-hop of Cure For The Itch) fail to engage in the same way that the others do, but that may be more a reflection on the quality of the other songs.<br />On the whole, LP do a really good job of conveying the turmoil of adolescence, and even if they do get a bit angsty at times (By Myself) and the lyrics are incessantly dark and gloomy, at least it feels real.<br />And, to finish on a positive, there couldn't be a better last track than Pushing Me Away. It's a pure rock anthem (with hardly any rapping), and if it is radio rock, then radio rock has never sounded so fresh and exciting.<br />I haven't heard Meteora yet, but I think LP are so much more than just another alternative boyband. They WILL last the course, of that you can be certain.
0380973464|4.0|This is a great book and was very enjoyable to read, a real page-turner like a good Clancy or King book that you can't put down. However, at around page 500, I just wanted this book to be over. I really wanted to find out how the story ends and find out what happened to the characters, otherwise I probably would have stopped reading the book (which I'm glad I did), but in the middle of the book it seemed more like the quest for the Holy Grail than a book.<br />The details in the book are amazing, Stephenson's sure done his research. Most sci-fi books are lite on true facts, just throwing in mumbo-jumbo to make it sound techie, but this book has the technical details right!
B0000019PA|5.0|why is it that people who do not like this record assume people who do are either following public opinion or trying to be clever?  why do they doubt the sincerity of the person who wrote it?  i had never heard of this album when i brought home a found copy. i will happily explain as best i can the appeal / meaning of any of the so-called non-sensical b.s. put forth on this record (albeit a subjective task). it is tremendously meaningful to me. polyester_halo at yahoo.com.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is an unqualified masterpiece.  Dazzling!  A rare combination of stylish animation and engaging, brilliant, truly original storytelling that will delight young and old for many repeated viewings.<br />The description above (the www.amazon.com one) is very good so I won't repeat it here.<br />Left out of the description, is that the japanese and the english dialogue are somewhat different.  I first saw the film in the theatres in the original Japanese (subtitled), and was delighted to find on the DVD subtle differences in the english dialogue that I imagine were changed to appeal more to english ears.  Not all the differences are language based.  (For instance: in the japenese version No-face doesn't really speak, he just urges people to take his gold with grunts and body language.  In the english version, he has dialogue.  Fascinating!)<br />Pixar shows great respect in their wonderful job of translation and addition of the english voices.  John Lassiter, of Pixar, is interviewed, and he discusses how impressive he feels this film is.  (There's a stamp of approval.)<br />Thank goodness both versions are included.  Watch them both!  The subtleties are worthwhile and interesting.<br />What I liked most about this movie is how immersed we become in the unusual world Chihiro finds herself in, and how absorbed we, as viewers, become in Chihiro's point of view and her plight.  I, quite often, felt just as she did - ignorant, scared, alienated, desparate, and overwhelmed.  My heart was racing.  Where was this place?  What was going on?  How was she going to get out of this?  What to do next?  I have not found these feelings to abate during further viewings.<br />While there are a few scary moments, I don't find them nearly as scary as the ... queen in Sleeping Beauty or the the forest scene in Snow White.  I think kids of all ages would really enjoy it.  (You might want to watch it first anyway and judge whether it might be too advanced or too scary for the little ones.)<br />The biggest mistake would be to think this is just for kids.  It's amazing.  Highly recommended!!  I would gladly give it more stars if I could.

B00008J2DQ|5.0|This album harkens back to the days of great 80's metal.  It's what Metallica would be if &quot;Load&quot; never happened.  Unfortunately the first release from the album, &quot;Straight Out of Line&quot;, was slightly less than expected quality, but if you skip past it on the first listen you'll discover that Godsmack continue to travel back in time, searching for heavy metal that was actually good, with a touch of Godsmack flair.  Granted, it follows the path of &quot;Awake&quot; and starts to dull near the end, but overall it triumphs over the last two albums.  (Track seven: best song ever!)
0671027573|1.0|I must say this book is not what other reviewers made it out to be. I cannot believe that a list would become a nationwide sensation. Add to that Jaine's juvenile ways('sticky out parts'? Please), and you have an unrealistic, juvenile read.
B000083E79|5.0|We believe in Cher-ing the wealth. So does Warner Strategic Marketing, who had quite the hand in this rehash and recycle of Cher's \\"very best.\\" There's nothing new here, and that doesn't matter. Cher fans will love the purple glittery slipcase packaging (wasn't her hair once this color?) Unwrap and find hit after hit, from \\"Believe\\" to \\"After All\\" to \\"If I<br />Could Turn Back Time\\" to \\"Heart of Stone\\" to a slew of vintage Cher solos, such as \\"Half-Breed,\\" \\"Dark Lady\\" and \\"Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves.\\" (Left out: \\"Carousel Man,\\" \\"The Way of Love\\" and \\"Train of Thought.\\" Our train of thought: Why?) There<br />are two Sonny and Cher golden oldies thrown in as well.

The beat goes on.<br />And yes, she's got us babe. So take me home. And we're taking \\"The Very Best of Cher\\"<br />with us.
B000000OQG|5.0|What can I say ? I was 15 when I first heard this, the second metal album I've ever owned. The first one was Iron Maiden's Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, and that was brilliant, but it wasn't the perfect introduction to metal, lacking the all-out fury that is, to me, the defining element of early '90s heavy metal. This album, however, definitely bristles with aggression and rebellion, blending it perfectly with gentler (but never mushy) moments, and I loved it on first listen. The opening riff of Welcome to the Jungle is impossible to forget, and it only gets better from there. Sweet child o' mine is one of my all time fav metal ballads (the others being Stairway to Heaven and Since I've been Loving you by Led Zep, Still loving you by the Scorpions and Fade to Black by Metallica).<br />This was the album that bridged the gulf between Metal and \\"ordinary\\" pop fans, who welcomed a metal album they could actually groove to. Pop/hair metal fans swooned over it and even hardheaded speed/thrash fans expressed their grudging admiration for its sheer genius.<br />Even though I later got into much heavier stuff like Sepultura, Kreator, Slayer and Deicide, this album has always held a very special place in my heart ... and my CD rack. ***Highly recommended***
0385335482|5.0|lOVED IT! I am addicted to Becky Bloomwood! The book is funny with just the right amount of (okay, so it's a tiny amount) suspense. I have her, and every other character, pictured in my head and can't want to see what she can screw up next! Keep 'em coming, Ms. Kinsella!
0780020901|2.0|Mahler is one of my favourite composers, to the extent that I am familiar with the scores of many of his symphonies. So it was with great anticipation that I went to see this film. What better raw material for a movie than the obviously troubled soul of this great man?<BR>What we get is a movie with highly varying quality and style, whose bits do not marry into an harmonious unison. Most of the time the film is realistic, and here Russell manages some real triumphs without plunging to vulgarity: all the train scenes are meticulously worked out, the relationship between Gustav and Alma at their lake-shore house (inc. the Kindertottenlieder music accompanying Alma looking for one of her daughters). Or the moving scene when Mahler visits Hugo Wolf in the asylum.<br />But then you get these forays into slapstick: The Chaplinesque scene sepicting Mahler's conversion to Christianity (Russell couldn't even resist putting on Woddy Allen style glasses on Mahler's nose) with Cosima Wagner as a vulgar Nazi Goddess.<br />Or the family scenes from Mahler's childhood, done with such exaggeration and vulgarity that you can be sure the Elders of Zion will have a hard time surpassing.<br />Or the swimming scene from Mahler's childhood, suffering from excess naivette.<br />Ken Russell looks as if he had a real hard time deciding what he wants to be: A serious movie director, or a really funny (??) guy. He seems to have overlooked the possibility of inserting humour, darkness and symbolism with nuances - he has to spit it in our face.<br />Many compliments go to Bernard Haitink who conducts the Royal Concertgebouw in a marvelous performance of the pieces.
B000089RVX|2.0|Yes, I know they're a religious group.  However, that doesn't mean electric guitars and a choir singing in the background belong together.  She has an awesome voice...but if you're going to be in the rock category, please think of something other than this.  It's a waste of time.
B00005YXZH|5.0|i have been reading some of the reviews here, and i just totally don't understand the people who gave this album less than 4 stars.  maybe they need to listen to YHF more or have a cigarette.  this album, to me, is one of the most beautiful, catchy, sorrowful, and political album i have ever heard.  (and do believe the fact, i have heard a lot of stuff)<br />i have to give this album no one less star, cause it deserve every single one of them.  if you can't agree, then don't.  YHF is not for everyone, but definately a great great musical accomplishment by Wilco, for the world of music.
B000002GVO|5.0|My title saying this is essential is no joke. If your favorite artist is Frank Sinatra this is essential. If your favorite is Lynyrd Skynyrd this is essential. If your favorite is Johnny Cash this is essential. If your favorite is the Village People this is essential.If your favorite is J.S. Bach this is essential.<BR>Hotel California- A great song. I believe it is about a bunch of psychos run a beautiful hotel and trap people inside it. The visitors can stab them with their steely knives but cannot kill the beast. Of course, that is my opinion but you have to admit this is a wonderful guitar solo. Henley's drumming helps an already perfect piece of music. <BR>New Kid In Town- I feel this is about music. Frey takes the mic for this. This is about music because at the time (1976) disco was the big thing. A few years earlier country rock was big. Disco was replaced by new age/techno. He is referring to disco as just another New Kid in Town.<BR>Life In The Fast Lane- This song is awesome. It is about drugs and it is a great hard-rocker.  <BR>Wasted Time- a jazzy ballad<BR>Wasted Time (Reprise)- The only song on the album I do not like. It is just an orchestra paying a verse of Wasted Time.<BR>Victim Of Love- Best on the album.        <BR>Pretty Maids All In A Row- Considering Joe Walsh's hard rocking past it is hard to believe his first song with the band would be a ballad. Awesome ballad though!!        <BR>Try And Love Again- Randy Meisner makes a great country-ish up-beat song.        <BR>The Last Resort- A story song about settlers headng West to look for paradise.  <BR>This is definetley one of the best albums ever. I cannot decide which is better, this or Fleetwood Mac's Rumours. The Eagles are planning an album to be released later this year, it will be their first album of all new mateial since 1979. I will do my part in trying to make their new album a #1 hit.
B000002MG1|5.0|I was in sixth grade when this album was released, which solidified my attraction to alternative music. Because I lived in rural New Jersey, the only radio stations we picked up were from Philadelphia's Temple University, and it was on those late-afternoon and evening broadcasts that I was introduced to the sounds of &quot;college rock&quot;. One night, the late night DJ played the not-yet released album. It was breathtaking. A chill still goes up my spine when I recall the first time I heard &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Nightswimming&quot;. But the all around gem is the haunting &quot;Find The River&quot;. Overall, Automatic is the peak REM would never reach again (although New Adventures in Hi-Fi ccomes damn close)but after a statement this strong, who could?
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is a part of \\"The Matrix\\" trilogy, no matter how you look at it. True Matrix fans will have to have this one-of-a-kind DVD featuring 9 short animated stories revolving around The Matrix world.

B000002L9J|5.0|This is the dream record for moody intellectuals with a sense of humor. Even through the bleak moments, Morrissey's vocals never lose that trademark bone-dry wit. An outstanding record from an extraordinary rock band.
B000002B7M|5.0|Blizzard of Ozz is simply one of the best hard rock albums ever. If you are a metal fan, this is as good as it gets. Every song is a beautiful entity within itself, yet all of them flow together seamlessly. My favorite songs are &quot;I Don't Know,&quot; &quot;Suicide Solution,&quot; &quot;Mr. Crowley,&quot; and &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth),&quot; although all 8 songs are amazing (one of the tracks isn't really a song; &quot;Dee&quot; is kind of an acoustic intro to the next track). And of course, this record houses the timeless classic &quot;Crazy Train,&quot; which is still incredible, despite its ubiquity.<br />It certainly was for the better when Ozzy Osbourne left (or was kicked out of?) Black Sabbath in 1979. The last few years of the band had been shaky, and they put out a couple of mediocre albums. After the departure, Ozzy made this magnificent album, and Black Sabbath made the mind-blowing &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot; with ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. So instead of one old, tired band making shabby material, we had two seperate artists making some of the best metal ever created. Ozzy collaborates wonderfully with guitarist Randy Rhodes, who is hands-down one of the best guitar players ever. His playing was as revolutionary as Van Halen was 2 years before him. He took Van Halen's speed and combined it with amazing neo-classical techniques. The instrumental sections of the songs carry you away into another universe, and the vocal parts are deliciously catchy and hummable. Despite Ozzy's extreme selling-out in recent years, Blizzard of Ozz is one of the things that reminds us of the terrific musician he once was.
B00005ASHM|5.0|If there was a way to give this record any more than 5 stars, I'd be all for it. It is a bona-fide masterpiece, created in an era where nobody seemed to get it.Pet Sounds is all at once beautiful, resounding, aching, passionate, bold, breathtaking, and especially, heartbreaking. Brian Wilson's opus is full of amazing songs, but &quot;God Only Knows&quot; and &quot;Caroline No&quot; are his best.
B00000IB4D|5.0|Though this Cd might be harder to get now that it is unavailable in the US, go to outside sources and buy it. A very strong Spiritual Latin Jazz fusion packed with numerous artist of the highest caliber. I could not find anything wrong with any of the tracks here on this Cd, Carlos again proves why he has taken so many by the heart and given so much back to his fans through his music. in taking to his brother Jorge Santana I had asked him what his all time favorite song of his brother was, he stated to me that it has to be (Yours Is The Light). Now on that alone I would recomend this Cd to anyone and everyone but when you here this Cd in its entirerty you will agree and be glad that you did not miss out on another beautiful creation by this legend artist. Peace in Music..
0451169514|5.0|This is my favourite book from my childhood as I could relate to all the main 7 characters, being that they were very similar to people I knew or had in the past. Not many people read It, and do not feel the same way.  This book is set in Derry, Maine.  Now grown up, moved away and having gotten on with their lives the main characters are drawn back to Derry.  This book is basically two stories, what happened in Derry when they grew up as kids and in the present with them confronting It and trying to kill It before It kills them. What is It?  Well that's the brilliance of this novel, It is an entity that can become anything.  It, is your worst imaginable thing you fear and it prey's upon those fears which it knows all too well.<br /><br />This is a sensational must read even if you don't like Stephen King novels. Do not be put off by the extremely bad TV miniseries of this book or by people who have seen it.  The book is nothing like the TV show.  Some reviews on this site are clearly referring to the TV show, you can tell by they say It is a clown so don't be put off by them.  Buy this brilliant masterpiece horror thriller.  You'll immensely enjoy it.<br /><br />Update June 2017 - I decided to re-read It, sometimes book, movies or whatever from your childhood that you loved, turn out to not be that great when you revisit them after a few decade.  Not so with It, it's still brilliant!  If you haven't tried It, check it out today!
0316921173|5.0|I think people are getting all riled up about the cohesiveness of the story because the book is 1000 pages long.  You guys are taking it too seriously.  The thing no one seems to have mentioned (like, at ALL) is that this book is a hell of a lot of FUN to read!  It may take a little while for the Fun to get rolling, but if  you have patience does it ever (get rolling (the fun)).  Jeez man.  Besides which it has a great story and yes Wallace gets very carried away but this can be FUN.  Seriously.  Wallace has restored my faith in books.  There's something to think about.
B000002JNN|5.0|This album was an excellent comeback for Australia's biggest rock band.  Not many songs can claim a better guitar intro than Thunderstruck.  The other huge hit from this album was of course Moneytalks which is almost as good.<br />There are no fillers amongst the other ten songs either.  They are all classic AC DC brilliance.<br />Are You Ready to Rock Your Heart Out?  If You Dare let your Money Talk, Fire Your Guns and buy this great album.  You'll be Thunderstruck by it's brilliance.
0805062971|5.0|I was already a major addict to the movie, but I finally got to read the book. It had many similarities to the movie, though the movie added some parts which were absent in the book, and the book had a few parts that were absent in the movie. <br />The book, Fight Club, was a very easy read for me (I read it in one night), and it actually made the movie make some more sense, though I quote it like one quotes the Bible, and the descriptions of many of the evnts were explained a lot more graphically than they were portrayed in the movie, and of course, the ending to the book was a surprise, to say the least, and I recommend this book just as much as I do the movie. Chuck Palahniuk is a great author, and Fight Club is one of the most important books to be released in the last decade. Its views of corporate society, and individualism are absolutely amazing and philosophical, almost the way Nietzsche's philosophy is.
0743244249|5.0|A fellow reviewer said Cosmopolis is short enough to read in a day. But this book is asking for more time. Eric Packer buffers himself from the present in order to stay ahead of the future--but his gadgets in home and car only give him a false sense of futuristic living. Antiquities like telephones and ATMs are still in operation, much to his chagrin. <br />What good is Packer's headlong rush into the future, if the sole purpose of this pursuit is to get the money that puts him out of touch?
B000089RVX|5.0|First of all. The comparison to Denali in my humble opinion is way off! Denali sounds more like Radiohead than evanescence, which is going for a completely different sound reminiscent of the haunting melodies/dark riffs of black sabbath/ozzy/dio with the fusion of new age hardrock. The end result is a modern sounding almost-metal band with amazing vocals that are pleasant to the ear. People who liked later sabbath(vol.4 and on) and ozzy/dio should like this band, as well as people who arent necesarilly into metal. There are a couple of extraordinary ballads, especially &quot;My Immortal&quot; which is my favorite song on the album despite being a metal buff myself.
0375701427|3.0|American Pastoral is written in quite eloquent prose and tells a rather harrowing story of how a father and mother deal with a horrendous act committed by their daughter.  Roth goes into great detail about several different topics from glove-making to the Newark riots.  At times, I felt like throwing the book across the room.  During one section of the book, when Swede is about to meet his daughter, whom he hadn't heard from in five years, Roth goes off on several tangents.  I wanted to read about where Merry had been, what Swede's reaction to her would be, what Merry's reaction would be.  Instead, I sludged through page after page about the Newark riots or what happened when Merry was younger, etc. while Swede was left standing there looking at the dog and cat hospital where he'd been told that Merry worked.  ...  But then, the bulk of the book was told as backstory.  I also don't know why Zuckerman was a character in the book, much less the narrarator (although I was glad that he was pretty much forgotten after the first 100 pages).<br />This was the first of Philip Roth's books that I had ever read. I came to Roth because of his literary reputation, and I chose American Pastoral because it had won the Pulitzer Prize.  It will be some time before I pick up another Roth book.  I think I'll read something by Larry McMurtry now....
B00005JKZV|5.0|Here a wizard is reborn, a king is reawakened, a war is joined, and the dawn finally breaks.<br />I was fortunate enough to see a pre-release version of this DVD in widescreen. Based on this I am quite willing to call this one of the finest films that I have ever seen. This applies to the quality of the acting, the dramatic power of the script, and the believability of the special effects. Personally, I didn't see a single flaw. And I understand that the commercial version will be even better with added scenes and features.<br />As for those purists who find fault with this film, well, I've read the trilogy through at least three times over the last quarter century and I saw nothing that was significantly unfaithful to the original story. If anything, this version reminded me of many details that I had forgotten. Believe me, if there would have been anything that rang false to the spirit of the original I would have spotted it.<br />Now all our hopes lie with two small hobbits in the wilderness- I can't wait for the release of the third part to the saga.
B000089CJI|3.0|I purchased this cd because I heard that Ben Gibbard, singer of the beloved Death Cab For Cutie, was the leadman of this band as well.  From listening to this, I learned that DCFC is more than just Ben Gibbard.  Not being a fan of techno or any electronica music, this cd helped expand my music tastes.  However, I liked (not loved) about half of these songs.  If you are a fan of DCFC, listen to samples from this album and then decide if you want it.  In my opinion, it doesn't approach anything that DCFC has done, mainly because it's a different genre of music.  The duets with the Jens are very melodic and nice though.
0875428940|4.0|Robin Wood's tarot deck was one of my first decks. I still use and enjoy the deck, however after a few years I suddenly started having a problem with her over use of yellow. Some of the cards, could really use some variation in their color. The only deck I like better is Universal Waite. As another reviewer mentioned, I also like \\"Tarot, Plain and Simple\\" as a companion book to this deck. Everything else about the deck is great. A wonderful first deck for a beginner, the images are clear and easy to interpret.

B00005MJ06|4.0|If you're looking for a good single-disc collection of Franki Valli &amp; the Four Seasons, this is one to consider.  It has more tracks then the latest &quot;Very Best Of&quot; CD and has slightly improved sound quality over the single-disc version of &quot;Anthology&quot;.  The Four Seasons had 29 Top-40 hits and a bevy of other popular favorites, so any single-disc collection is  bound to be missing a few.  &quot;Definitive&quot; contains all the really big hits including a few from Franki Valli's solo years.  Some missing hits include:  Ronnie, Alone, Save It For Me, Big Man In Town, Opus 17, Beggin', C'mon Marianne, and Watch the Flowers Grow.  And missing from Franki's solo years are:  You're Gonna Hurt Yourself, I Make A Fool Of Myself, To Give The Reason I Live, The Girl I'll Never Know (Angels Never Fly This Low), Swearin' To God, Our Day Will Come, and Fallen Angel.  If any of these exclusions bother you greatly, then you may wish to consider either of the Anthology sets (the single-disc or the double-disc version) as an alternative.  If you're more of a casual fan and are looking for the cream of the Four Seasons along with Franki Valli's biggest solo hits, then this is a fine choice.  The sound quality is excellent throughout and most of the tracks are presented in true stereo.  The mono tracks are:  New Mexican Rose, Dawn (Go Away), Rag Doll, Girl Come Running, and Let's Hang On.
B00005JL78|5.0|A wonderfully made storyline and plot, with unexpected parts. Very cool movie.
B00005JLKN|5.0|\\"ed norton miscast\\"? no way! his weasle-ness set the perfect mood for me... i kept expecting him to succumb to lechter's mindgames - i thought ed's character would eventually give in and do something sinister/crossing over to the dark side... i think that was a major key in why i loved this movie. and to my surprise, i even like this one better than 'silence of the lambs'!!!<BR>(cant believe i said that!)<BR>and even the tattooed sub-villain's presence is priceless (even if it is a direct copy of norman bates from 'psycho'!).<BR>i love this movie... well directed, well acted... well done.<br />sum.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Unlike most reviewers, I did not hear of this artist through the Grammy awards.  I can also safely say that I could not name a \\"jazz\\" artist if my life depended on it.  I first heard \\"Don't know why\\" while watching the movie \\"Maid in Manhattan\\" (coincidently, I don't think the movie will win big at the academy awards but the story, while predictable, was cute.  Besides, my wife loves romatic comedies no matter how bad they are and Jennifer Lopez is Hot!) <br />This CD is really fantastic.  Its nice not to have to compare her to \\"greats\\" in the jazz hall of fame since I don't know any.  This album is smooth and while I don't like every song, I figure more than fifty percent is a keeper.  Nightingale is a fantastic song.  Very mellow.<br />If you tend to lean towards Matchbox 20, Nickelback, John Mayer etc.  or pop stuff with lots of synthesized instruments, fast tempos, and highly sexed lyrics, this is probably not the album for you.  But if your willing to slow down, mellow out, and aren't too caught up in this cage we call genre, this CD might just be a keeper in your collection.
B00005JKZT|5.0|The special effects are wonderful. They did the book some justice. Well done.
B00004BZ16|5.0|this is possibly the greatest c.d. of all time. The reggae/funk/disco sound is unbelievable. Sandinista features my all time favorite clash songs ever, washington bullets and hitsville UK. I gaurantee this c.d. will amze anyone, and if you say different your a liar.
B00005NB8K|5.0|This movie was amazing. I watched an interview dvd with the doors prior to it, and this was taken exactly from what they said. Every inch of this movie was from the mouths of the real people, so accurate and he really looks like jim alot in this.
B00005JLXC|2.0|DAREDEVIL is a film that needed a lot of fixing up. One of the main and most interesting characters gets the kicked out the picture half way through. Conceptually it kept close to the original comic but it lacked the story. The film's visual style was also a little confusing in parts. It is one of those films that tells the origins by starting with an event at the beginning that isn't explained until the end. Very disappointing when you realize it was nothing special.<br />Directed by Mark Stephen Johnson (Jack Frost, Ghostrider) the film is a little slow and dark in the beginning. The story doesn't start to get interesting until the main temptress played by Jennifer Garner (Pearl Harbor, Catch Me If You Can) shows up and has some great fighting sequences.<br />The most interesting character is Collin Farrell (S.W.A.T., Phone Booth) interpretation as Bullseye. He is exciting and evil and really seems to be the only one who is having fun in the film. He is energetic and exciting.<br />The story is that of the making of the Vigilante known as Daredevil. The beginnings are shallow and short and the accident not really explained much and the father is played by David Keith (Office And A Gentlemen, Firestarter) who gives a short but meaningful performance.<br />Now as for Ben Afflect (Sum of All Fears, Pearl harbor, Armageddon) as Daredevil, he was week. He was more interesting as the alter-ego Matt Murdock. Even that was a a little shallow.<br />Overall it is an okay rental movie and certainly watchable on cable - but nothing to write home about. I think they rushed the script to ride the tales of the Brilliant production of Spider-Man. That was good writing and production. 5-20-03
B000002UD0|4.0|&quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; is the album John Lennon recorded when he was holed up in California during a separation from Yoko Ono.  That fact along allows anyone with a passing knowledge of Freudian psychology to find insights into pretty much every song on the album, which is a pretty schizophrenic collection of songs.  On the one hand we have the ethereal &quot;#9 Dream&quot; and the raw emotion of &quot;Going Down on Love&quot; and &quot;Steel and Glass.&quot;  You even have Lennon's first #1 hit as a solo artist, &quot;Whatever Gets You Thru the Night,&quot; a frenetic duet with Elton John.  There is also &quot;Old Dirt Road,&quot; co-written with Harry Nilsson, which as a song is almost as memorable as when Lennon and Nilsson went down to the Troubadour and heckled the Smothers Brothers and ended up in a fight.  But then there are songs that were just not worth the vinyl, namely &quot;Beef Jerky&quot; and &quot;Ya Ya&quot;; I mean, the titles give it away on that pair.  This 1974 effort was the last album of original songs Lennon would record before his &quot;retirement&quot; (the 1975 album &quot;Rock 'n' Roll&quot; was a collection of cover songs).  But in 1980 there was going to be &quot;Double Fantasy&quot; and Mark David Chapman, which makes listening to &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; a mixed blessing.
B00000K0E5|4.0|GOLDENEYE was the first film to introduce Pierce Brosnan (Quest For Camelot, Thomas Crown Affair, Die Another Day) as the new 007 - Bond, James Bond. Directed by action director Michael Campbell (Vertical Limit, The Mask Of Zorro) the movie introduces a diabolical plan to destroy all electrical systems of the planet.<br />The evil mastermind of this plot is Alec Travelyan played by Sean Bean (Lord Of The Rings, Black Beauty) with his henchmen Boris played incredibly well by Alan Coming (X-Men 2, Annie).<br />The movie is filled with action, gadgets and excitement including a chase sequence through the Russian Square with a real tank.  He also has his beautiful women that he must - must - must - interact with -like Izabella Scorupco (Vertical Limit, Reign Of Fire).<br />Joe Don Baker (Tomorrow Never Dies, Mars Attacks) plays an incredibly funny US Military agent who ads a little spark to Bonds Adventures. He caries this character into the next two Bond Films as well. They are fun to watch together.<br />This also marks the debut of the new M and Miss Moneypenny. The fantastic Dame Judith Dench (Shakespeare In Love, Chocolat, The Shipping News) takes on the role of the British Secret Service Commander \\"M\\". She plays the role in the next 4 Bond films with flair, energy and smarts. Samantha Bond (Breakout, Emma) takes on the teasing Miss Moneypenny that ends up having a great chemistry with Pierce.<br />The movie is exciting and filled with action and special effects. Pierce's performance as the new Bond make it believable and as if he had been doing this all his life. The extra features include a great commentary track, a behind the scenes special and a Bon retrospective! Very entertaining and informative.  Incredible acting and sincerity he has on screen.  This is a MUST for every Bond fan. 5-20-03
630518299X|5.0|With the explosion of reality T.V., no film could be more relevant than this masterpiece.  An allegorical film about exploitation and how far it can actually go, &quot;The Truman Show&quot; is a perfect answer to what dominates the airwaves nowadays.  Plus, the acting is splendid, the script is beyond great, and the ending is a real tearjerker.  One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and I've seen way too many movies for my own good. (jk)
B00006F83Y|4.0|Queens of the Stone Age have become poster boys of sorts for bands bringing back traditional rock and roll ethics to major label, readily available, radio-rotated music (though I'm sure the payola money the label had to shell out for this radio play isn't a traditional part of &quot;real rock&quot;, but that's beside the point), so of course we have an album that's hyped as a little more than it eventually ends up being.  For the most part, the Queens deliver--&quot;No One Knows&quot;, &quot;...Millionare&quot;, &quot;Go With the Flow&quot;, &quot;Song for the Deaf&quot;, &quot;Song for the Dead&quot;, these are all punishing, gritty rock songs that incite feelings of excessive masculinity.  Unfortunately, the album as a whole is more than a bit redundant, as you'd probably guess with there being 14 songs on here.  Great musicianship abounds, but some of the choruses wear thin too quickly, and the guitar grit keeps accumlating until you're forced to save the last few songs for another listen.  Still great, but best taken in small doses.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I must admit, I was alittle nervous about buying this CD.  After seeing her evolving image and shedding more clothing at each appearence.  The video was well, Dirrrrrrty.  I was watching it thinking is this the same Christina that did that cute little Genie song?  What happened??  And the Cd title: Stripped.  I thought that was bull how she was saying it wasnt it meant to be sexual just very personal and true to herself.  She tried to clarify that in every TV interview and then ends up on the cover half naked.  Crazy, but I bought the CD (gotta support my home girl...go pittsburgh!).  I also think she has one of the best voices in the businesses.  The songs are very original and catchy and really enhance her singing ability.  I really loved most of the songs on here with the exception of the numerous interludes that I don't think add much but serve as fillers.  Here's the rundown:<BR>1. Stripped Part 1: Numerous cameo's...Fred Durst to name a few.  Intro to CD <BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down: Nice beat, catchy rap tune. Lil kim enters to fill some vocals.  Very nice upbeat song.  7/10<BR>3. Walking Away: Decent song, it's kinda slow and redundant in the beginning but it picks up, really creative lyrics, but the tune gets annoying after awhile.  6/10<BR>4. Fighter: Great song, I really enjoyed the rock feel to it.  It also has a great message.  9/10<BR>5. Interlude....shes playing guitar and talking in espagnol.  <BR>6. Infatuation: An ode to her ex Puerto Rican lover, good song, i like the guitar in the background, nice and upbeat, good grooving tune  8/10<BR>7. And yet another interlude....notice how i don't rate these<BR>8. Loving Me For Me: Slow ballad, i didn't like it at first but it grows on you...pretty song but slow and it dragges 6/10<BR>9. Impossible: If your an Alicia Keys fan you'll love it, Im not really but its a decent song, its very repetitous though 5/10<BR>10. Underappreciated: Infatuation Part 2...the break up.  Fairly upbeat tune, it doesn't stand outmuch though like some of the others, its decent though  6/10<BR>11. Beautiful: Great song....its well beautiful.  She sounds amazing hitting those high notes, good self-esteem booster, beautiful piano background 10/10<BR>12. Make Over: Very almost heavy metalish sounding, but fairly catchy, she doesn't \\"sing\\" much tho, alot of more yelling but its decent enough 7/10<BR>13.Cruise: Very slow in the beginning, it gradually gets better, its very repetitous tho, not my favorite.  But its a nice ballad 6/10<BR>14.Soar: One of my faves, nice and upbeat, great message. Its one of those songs that really contrasts those half naked outfits and dirrty videos.  I wish she would do more of these amazing songs with great messages 10/10<BR>15. Get Mine, Get Yours: I love the tune, the lyrics are well...risque.  It would be a perfect upbeat tune if it wasn't such a raunchy topic.  I cant believe its right after such an empowering song like soar. 9.5/10<BR>16. Dirrty: This wasn't my fave, hated the video, not digging the message...but fairly catchy tune 5/10<BR>17. Stripped Part 2: One phrase sums this interlude up \\"sorry im not a virgin\\"<BR>18. The Voice Within: Another fantastic tune...I love it, it starts as a ballad and she really hits those high notes.  Another empowering message.  I really love this song 10/10<BR>19. I'm Okay: Pretty good song, very emotional but it drags at the end.  7/10<BR>20. Keep Singin My song: Another good message, nice way to end CD but alittle repetitive.  8/10<BR>So really a good CD, none of the songs r bad, some stand out more than others.  Christina has talent, its sad that she thinks she needs to dress like a tramp to get noticed.  Maybe she'll realize that her image is not reflective of her talent and is not sending a good message out to young girls.  But buy it...its very good. Just clean up the act Christina, then you'd be perfect!

0385504209|5.0|I do not read a book to critique an authors writing style.  I read a book for entertainment, and to have thoughts provoked.  This book does both.  It is a very interesting mystery suspense book, that kept me up reading late at night.  It also peaked my interest in the Grail legends and Leonardo Da Vinci.  I did not know anything about the Grail legends, Da Vinci, or any of things the book discussed.  I know the book is a work of fiction, so I would not even begin to assume that all that is presented is true.  However, it made me so interested in the subjects, that I have started reading non-fiction about the grail legends, Mary Magdalene etc. At an exhibit of religious art I was interested in looking at the symbology and things that were discussed in the book.  For me, that is what makes this a great read.  The book is very entertaining, and it makes you think.  I will say that those people who are Catholic, may not like the book, becuse it is not completely flattering in the way it portrays the church, but I do not think it is a vendetta, and remember it is a work of fiction.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I would see it over and over again if I could. It's a great movie with action, suspence,fantisy, and it keeps you wondering, \\"Are they gonna make it?\\" For a second there, I thought that Gandolf was dead. He's pretty brave to fight that Shadow monster while they're falling over 50 feet. Aragon and Legolas are my FAVORITE. I like Legolas's bow and arrow skill. I like how the beginning starts with the three people are running and that dwarf is trying to keep up. Newayz, it's a great movie which I recommend everyone see, even if you're not into non-reality type movies.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I thought I would like this CD based on the songs that get radio play, but I was sorely disappointed!  On the more melodic songs, Chris Cornell's voice just ruins the entire thing, plus he can't carry a melody unless he's yelling.  Nasty, this Cd is just gross.  It's Rage with a new singer - wow, that's really original.  I suggest writing some more original lyrics and creating a new sound, not just cashing in on the old sounds of rage and soundgarden.  That shows originality alright.
0805017305|1.0|This book lacked any kind of compelling literature required to spark the interest of any person who reads from the \\"young adult\\" catagory. It is boring. It tries to spark deep emotion with short descriptions that seem brutal and horrific. And yes they are if you are searching for facts, but if you wish to read a book that keeps you interested WHILE at the same time states facts, I suggest you look somewhere else.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Saw the band live in Philly last night and they rocked the house.  Just them for about 2 1/2 hours.  Besides their classics, they did a lot from Say You Will - and did it with passion and skill.  This studio album takes some new risks and at the same time finds some comfortable places to go.  The creativity is back without sacrificing the music's driving rythms and melodic accessability - presented in some of Fleetwood Mac's best music in years.  The projected \\"single\\" - Peacekeeper - is really good and it's not even the best track on the CD - isn't that usually the way.  \\"Everybody Finds Out\\", \\"What's the World Coming To?\\", \\"Miranda\\", \\"Say Goodbye\\", and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" are my favorites.  The latter evokes a sort of Stones-like Country-tinged ballad - Buckingham's vocals a little Jaggerlike.  \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Come\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" are right up there, too.  The album grows on you - fast.  Between the second and third listen I was hooked.  Sure, I miss Christine, but this is a great rock album nonetheless.  If it doesn't get a lot of radio play and win some Grammys, something's not right.
B00008G9JO|5.0|This album was the one that made me realize, when I was twelve, that I would be spending a lot of money completing my Jethro Tull collection. After War Child got my attention and Benefit bewitched me, Heavy Horses drove home the undeniable fact that this band was a force to be reckoned with.<BR>I have been looking forward to the remaster, for the drum mix and the warmth and presence of the acoustic guitars made this one of the most well-recorded and realized albums of the Seventies. Tull hit upon an exact sound for this album that perfectly suits Ian's earthy songwriting here. And the songs are fantastic.<BR>To those reviewers who think they know a little about music because they learned the word &quot;diatonic,&quot; and the term &quot;key changes&quot; - remember that a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. A good understanding of harmonic vocabulary and, above all, an appreciation of form, reveal the hidden power of every song on this masterful work. <br />The lyrics are among the best Ian has had to offer - like good poetry, the songs are full of concrete images, and not just visual imagery, but snapshots that can convincingly put you in the moment. Mind you, the experiences conveyed in this album are from real life, not the kind of overblown fantasy world pretention that some may expect from &quot;progressive rock,&quot; but they certainly are not &quot;banal,&quot; just non-pretentious.<BR>If you &quot;avoid this recording,&quot; the loss is entirely yours. You and this album deserve a fresh opinion, so don't miss out because you read someone's unfortunately off-base review. Listen to it yourself - and remember that, as with all great songwriting, its strengths reveal themselves gradually, with repetition. This is no instant-gratification album, but those who give it the depth of listenings that it deserves will reap very satisfying results.<BR>Great stuff!
B00006FDCD|4.0|Often Stephen King's books have trouble making the transition to movie format, but I thought this one was very well done.  Tim Curry (Pennywise the Dancing Clown) and the many young actors really made this movie great, particularly Jonathan Brandis (young Bill.) I'm sorry I can't say the same for the supposedly more professional and experienced older actors who played the tortured and recently returned to Dairy adults, I just thought they stunk with a capital S.
B00005Y228|5.0|Great CD for dance music fans! Buy this and be satisfied;)
020530902X|3.0|Strunk and White's book on style  is small and to the point.  The elements of style discussed are not necessarily applicable to modern creative writing.  This book, no doubt, is helpful for writing formally-- such as formal essays, articals, and such.  I didn't give it a full 5 stars because writing can be an art form as well as a tool, and for the most part this book treats it as a tool.
B000005RTG|1.0|I've been a deep Purple nut for a long time. Saw them on The House of Blue Light Tour, and watched with my jaw hanging open as Ritchie Blackmore stood at the front of the stage with lazers shooting all around him, blazing out the most insane guitar solo I've ever heard to this day. On the previous Purple release, Stormbringer, you could tell there was tension within the band and let's face it: Ritchie's playing on that was no In Rock or Burn ... BUT IT ROCKED! I think when you have a guitar wizard like Blackmore at the strings, even when he's bored he sounds amazing. I never thought I'd give a Deep Purple CD a one star rating, and I'm not Bolin bashing either, I know the dude isn't with us anymore and that's the last thing I'd ever do. I'm lending some critique on his playing here; and it's very boring. I think Ritchie Blackmore tuning his guitar up would have rocked out more. There's no guitar wizardry here that you heard with Blackmore at the front, no solos that make you say, \\"How did he get that sound out of a guitar?\\" or just anything technical in a guitar playing sense. I don't know what the other band members were thinking of when this all went down? Could Zeppelin ever have replaced Jimmy Page? NO. Deep Purple should have come to the fact that although they are all superb musicians, you just can't replace a guitar player like Ritchie Blackmore. They all would have been better off doing solo projects or something until he came back. Bolin was a great guitar player; but there's great and then there's INSANE great: Blackmore is INSANE great. I have this only to be able to say I have every Purple release. It doesn't get much air time on my stereo. If you like the Coverdale days, go directly to Burn and then Stormbringer. 1 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF POWER METAL, USA.
B00008H2LB|4.0|People who enjoyed &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; will not be disappointed by this album.  LP also experiments a little more with the electronics in this one, and the provided booklet does explain the direction they wanted to go in well.  For those who didn't like the album for various reasons perhaps were expecting too much -- after all, &quot;HT&quot; was an album strewn with anthems and such, and yes LP is a bit commercial, but expecting them to turn around and do a 180 after &quot;HT&quot;'s success is a little naive.  All in all, great music to speed to.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Why amazon.com don't have 5 stars for Ironman I got this joint this one of the best albums I every heard the best tracks on here is ''Daytona 500'' and ''All that I got is you'' Wu is the greatest group of all time they make a lot of classics if you don't got it get it.
6302859204|3.0|This movie deals with a man form the country being abducted. The aliens through him on a table, strip him down to his briefs, and perform medicla experiments on him. It is a very creepy movie, but the effects are a little cheap. Try it.
B00001IVOF|5.0|This a classic I like this album after they made Infamous they new they were going to have a great career and put out more classics this a classic album i love this you buy this album.
B0000931OG|4.0|I'll admit, my favorite Blur period to date consists of the mid-90's powerpop troika of \\"Modern Life\\", \\"Parklife\\" and \\"Great Escape\\".  I love the catchy melodies and lush instrumentation of that period.  \\"Think Tank\\" continues Blur's graduation from that period, with the influx of Radiohead and Pavement toolbox sounds as the core instrumentation.  Don't listen for mid-90's irony in these lyrics; this is good \\"low\\" music with the occasional punkpop cherry bomb (\\"Crazy Beat\\", \\"We've Got a File ...\\") thrown in.  Some of the songs are melodically quite good, and evoke a quiet mood.  I'm reminded in some instances of Beck's great \\"Mutations\\" when I listen to this disc.  I've listened to \\"Think Tank\\" several times over the past ten days because I want to, not because I'm trying to like it.  Albarn hasn't yet run out of brilliant musical ideas.
B00005JKPF|4.0|The movie was very good, i saw it 12 times but it's still exciting now.It is way better than the first one, way more action!!! and the new characters r alsome so buy the DVD and enjoy the action
B0000024IE|5.0|I listened to this for the first time in several years and it took me back to when &quot;Do The Right Thing&quot; was out in theatres.  I forgot how good this album was!  Every track and I mean EVERY track moves you.  It makes me nostalgic for a time when rap meant something other than money, women, and bling bling.  A must have for every music collection.
B00008J4P5|4.0|Well, at first I thought that The White Stripes were talentless and not worthy to deem the title of musician.  Well, all changed with this latest release.  I'll admit, it IS VERY simplistic, but that simplistic theme gives it its edge.  I mean, c'mon, would you rather listen to someone TRY to do something they cannot?  NOT ME!  I rather listen to MUSIC that the performers feel they're capable of playing.  Some other reviewer posted something about &quot;You can't get very complicated with a guitar and simple four piece drum set.&quot;  I beg to differ, look at rage against the machine.  On their self-titled CD, the drummer uses NO toms on his kit, instead he uses cow-bells...AND IT IS MAGNIFICENTLY DONE!  So to all the people who say that this band is boring....well you have a problem if all you can do in life is over-analyze music...what a shame!  In this album I hear mixes of punk, (without the GOD AWFUL vocals and monotonous &quot;fast&quot; rythyms)I hear vocals pretty similar to Mick Jagger and I hear an innovative NEW approach to music...I've been playing drums for 9 years now and I can tell you...Yes, Meg isn't the BEST drummer, but she does the job to the best of her capability, and I applaud that...in all, if you liked that late 60-ish, early 70-ish raspy rock guitar TONE, and you like to hear a new approach to music, get it, the worst that can happen is you'll fall in love...I seriously hear 70s influences in this album...maybe this is what the 70s would of been like if there was NO Hendrix, The Who, Joplin, etc...interesting!
B00007KWHN|3.0|Progressive rock was the stuff that mystified me in my youth. The amazing talent and the guts required to try and make rock more majestic and symphonic, while showcasing the bands individual abilities and prowess. In time all things must pass (and they should) and the passing of art rock helped preserve it safely in a very specific time capsule, easily viewable from the future present. As I look back at so many progressive art rock type bands and albums few stand the test of time. In a nut shell regarding this album (the Yes Album) the vocals are almost unbearable both the annoying high pitch and some of the silly lyrics are just a bit too ridiculous. The playing can be criticized as well (but I won't because I can't play it) but I will say Steve Howe is a smidge over rated... If you really find this CD awesome then you really need to get Emerson Lake and Palmer's \\"Tarkus\\" CD or King Crimson's \\"21st Century Schizoid man\\" or Eno's \\"Here come the warm jets\\" all of these CD's (simply put) hold up better in the light of the modern day and are very enjoyable considering any musical format.<br />Brian Eno = Here come the warm jets<BR>King Crimson = 21st Century <BR>ELP = Tarkus<br />Just a thought, if you are searching for progressive rock classics
0066214122|3.0|Add one or more of the following into a word processor:<br />1. A wonderful new world-changing discovery, of which some element usually runs amok and kills people before being destroyed or contained. (For examples, see \\"The Andromeda Strain,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"The Lost World,\\" \\"The Terminal Man,\\" \\"Sphere,\\" \\"Congo\\" and \\"Timeline.\\")<br />2. Backstabbing corporate intrigue, putting getting ahead over everything else, including ethical/moral scruples and other people's lives. (See \\"Rising Sun,\\" \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Disclosure,\\" \\"Airframe,\\" \\"Congo\\" and \\"Timeline.\\")<br />3. Family problems, ranging from squabbling siblings to broken marriages. (See \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"Disclosure\\" and \\"Airframe.\\")<br />4. Sexual tension or the outright dirty deed. (See \\"Sphere,\\" \\"Disclosure,\\" \\"Airframe\\" and \\"Rising Sun.\\")<br />5. Plenty of danger to protagonists, with lots of gory descriptions if applicable. (See all of the above.)<br />Mix well. Label with \\"Michael Crichton\\" in large letters. Serve half-baked and see who comes in for dinner.<br />That's really the best way to describe \\"Prey,\\" Michael Crichton's latest techno-thriller bestseller. As in many of his earlier novels, a new technology goes haywire -- in this case, nanotechnology at an isolated production facility in the Nevada desert. The narrator, a former Silicon Valley hotshot who is now a househusband thanks to being the victim of a corporate frame-up (an element which feels like it never quite fits into the rest of the story), is asked by his former company to go to the Nevada facility (which is conveniently run by his partially estranged wife) and do some consulting. Of course, once he arrives he finds that the nanotechnology has spiraled out of control, creating a horrible threat to humanity that has been covered up by the company.<br />\\"Prey\\" is definitely an exciting read, with lots of people in distress from the rogue technology, but with its nests and blood and gore and sex, I had the distinct feeling I'd seen it all before. I felt like I could actually name which of Crichton's previous novels on which particular elements were based. (Or someone else's novels -- one specific bit sounded like it was lifted right out of Stephen King's \\"The Green Mile.\\")<br />None of the characters have any real depth, apparently having been turned out by the hundreds at some bizarre Character Factory somewhere. You have your social-misfit scientists, super-driven 28-hour-a-day corporate fanatics, angst-ridden teenagers, and others, none of them any more than cookie-cutter products. (Most of Crichton's novels are like that nowadays. Only his earlier books feature characters with any real depth or personality.)<br />But perhaps I'm being too harsh. After all, if you pick up a book for summer reading (which, let's face it, \\"Prey\\" is), you don't expect Shakespeare. And this is what people have come to expect from Crichton's novels. So after considerable thought, I give it three stars -- kinda good on its own, but when you compare it to his other work, we've been on this monster ride before.
B000007T1M|5.0|Wonder where they got their names? Well how about this they are not even American so they have the point of view from outsiders. Their name is System of A Down and anyone who knows anything about anarchy would know what the System is. This cd has great tracks called Sugar, Spiders, and Ddevil. They are very Charismatic and a rush of hard hitting anti government music.
B00005JLEU|3.0|One of the most original and beautiful films to come out of Japan, Spirited Away suffers in English-speaking countries from the poor dubbing forced upon it by the Disney distributors. I could say so much about this film, but the other reviewers have said it all, apart from the fact that this film (like all films) is diminished in quality once an overdub track has been laid over the original language. The three stars is for the English over-dubbed version. I saw this film in the original Japanese and couldn't watch more than five minutes of the English dubbing without wanting to switch it off. (Obvious) American over-dubbing (which not only translates the language, but changes the content of what is spoken)is the reason so many foreign films fare poorly when released outside of their native lands. Ban all over-dubbing! [I remember somebody telling me that even the Australian Mad Max (released as The Road Warrior) was over-dubbed! What a joke]
B00005A46T|5.0|This alubm has tracks on it that will make you think \\"Hey these guys are really angry at society\\" or something along those lines. With their song The heretic Anthem will make you think that they are satanic but in fact a heretic is a non believer or an Atheist. The Song People= S... is a song that will build up your adrenaline and won't let you go until you are filled with so much you want to start moshing your bedroom walls. Disaster pieces which talks about slitting throats shows their anger once again. With songs like these you should listen to this cd when angry at someone they will help you cope and make you feel that you can relate. Though the music is not has good as the first cd.
B00005M91K|5.0|Baraka is the arabic word for blessing. I've got this from a friend as a gift, and i should thank her alot. it is a free sprirt traveling far and wide, just to see how different we are, and how we must appreciate these differences. <BR>but the 'Chicken' chapter was incredible. forget about chicken meals from now on...
B00005JLK1|2.0|The beginning was good, I agree, nice way to get rid of lot's of people. The cast was good as well, but the movie was not scary!... I mean come on, I was expecting a horror, and i got to see like what, 3 ghosts that looked like normal people?<BR>Oh yea and the twist in the end wasn't that shocking. Not a horrible waste of time and money, but still, I was expecting to see a horror, and what i ended up feeling was sea-sick.
B00001U0DP|5.0|this is a big must-have for movie fans, and a perfect gift in any occasion. a Jew, blessed with an enormous talent, in words or actions, he turns things from worse to good, from good to better, for his love, later to be his wife, and his dearest Kid.
B00005JLRT|4.0|Ok here we go.  I just finished watching the film for the first time, and I can honestly say my draw jopped numerous times during my viewing.  I'll start with the special effects.  Great.  Next on the action, SUPERB!  The space battle at the end was absolutely breathtaking, and the characters seemed more \\"human\\" than your typical \\"everything is dandy in the Trek universe\\" that has been an element in TNG since the beginning.  The story, although sort of a [copy] of Star Trek II, is very well told with a menacing villain, tense situations, and some pretty wild action scenes (did I mention that already?).<br />This is a VERY different Trek than fans would expect.  But I knew it would be for two reasons.<br />1) The trailer - dark, mysterious, brooding...it hinted at something that had never been done before in Trek films.<br />2) The director, Stuart Baird.  If you are at all familiar with his work, you'll know his films are hardly light, and to be honest, if I were looking for a Trek director to continue the series, Baird would be low on my list.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, as a revision was, in my opinion after seeing the film, what the franchise needed (box office take suggested otherwise, however).<br />The thing about this movie that really caught my attention was Picard's character seemed much different at the beginning.  Most Trek fans would label this as an atrocity, but I find it an interesting \\"addition\\" to Picard's personality not told in the series and films.  It makes him so less hardcore and we see the kid in him (interesting since this film is about his younger clone).<br />With that said, don't expect anything.  Go rent the movie and see for yourself.  But see it with an open mind, and no preconceptions.  Love the characters, but don't insist you know everything about them and are an expert in what they would or should do.  I, more than once, cheered out loud...that doesn't happen very often.
0060977493|5.0|i read the book three years ago. in the newspaper review, it was written: this book is not for any reader, only for the best of readers. and i wanted to think of myself as one of the best of readers. <BR>fortunately, it was excellent, great, beautiful, and the twist and turns is what you would expect from Roy. i later found out she is a great political writer, very strong, and she seems to be a never ending fountain of information. She uses the English language even better than mother-tonge speakers do.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This movie is by far one of the most enjoyable films ever made. You are just thrown into the plot head-on and then given little chance to breathe as Bryan Singer takes you deep into a story so rich with characters(the best part of the movie) and the acting genius that is Kevin Spacey. No matter what anyone says this movie is awesome. It's full of twists and turns that take the viewer on an amazing ride. If you have never seen it then give it a chance and I'm sure you will enjoy it.
B00001QEE6|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is a story about the adventures of Lady, a sweet and pampered Cocker Spaniel; and tramp, a footloose and collar-free mutt.<br />I will give this movie more stars if I could! Adults will love the beautiful story filled with romance, and the movie has a very good soundtrack. The songs are enjoyable, especially 'Bella Notte' and 'He's A Tramp'. <br />Kids will love the cute-looking dogs and will enjoy going along with the dogs' adventures.<br />AND ALL AGES WILL ENJOY THE SPAGHETTI SCENE!
B00006RU5B|3.0|If someone would have told me that Chris Cornell would do something musically vital after his...'Beatles-wannabe' solo album, I would have claimed them insane.  This album nearly defies my thinking...nearly.  At it's high points, it delivers neanderthal riffs in true solid mid-tempo guitar rock fashion.  At it's weak points, it has many loose ends which are result of laissez faire style Rick Rubin production.  You can hear it all over this disc.  Soundgarden complained that Michael Beinhorn was too tough on them in the studio, but the strength of 'Superunknown' is in the music and performances.  A producer with vision assembles band member performances to deliver a complete, intricately painted canvas.  Chris' vocals were bar none the best the 90's had to offer in the rock domain.  Was it Rick who made the decision to have Chris Cornell mimic Brian Johnson of AC/DC on at least two of these Audioslave tracks?  Bad production decision.  Who let the riffs of Tom Morello linger in one simple blues/box phrase for many, many, many bars too long with no invention or change?  Bad production decision.  It leaves Chris with little room to move in the verses on the bulk of these songs and at times, the material gets bogged down and tedious.  The songs at times are repetitious and lethargic.  The guitar work comes alive when solos appear and the sonic elements are a robust joy to behold.  High engineering marks for those.  The vocal composites that ended up as the 'master vocal takes' on these songs though are the real sore spot and are well short of the mark for what Chris can deliver and should deliver.  I wonder if Rick Rubin was even in the studio when the vocals were assembled.  We know the potential here, and the obvious feedback in the studio should have been \\"these tunes need to be developed\\".  If the staid riffs don't entice the vocal and don't give the singer (the best in rock music today) something better to sing over, then you are destined to make a record such as this.  This could be a great band, let's hope they get the proper feedback next time in the studio....
B00005YXZH|1.0|This record is a totally unlistenable--and unimaginable, blend of Tangerine Dream and the Flying Burrito Bros. There's a good reason why Wilco's orginal label refused to release this record: the band took simple, catchy country rock melodies and mixed synthesizers and sound effects, for no particular reason and to no good purpose. Run away, run far away!
B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones, the daughter of sitarist Ravi Shankar.  Certainly no newcomer to music, she's a promising new vocal talent in music.  Interesting to find this released by Blue Note.  She is sure to have a long career delivering original music.  One can speculate whether Blue Note's missing the boat on the music of the now deceased Eva Cassidy weighed in their decision to sign the lovely Ms. Jones.  To a fault, most of the standard material  on this disc is delivered with near identical verse vocal phrasing and at times one feels as if they are listening to the same song over and over.  The producer surely must have made comment on that fact.  It leaves one wondering about the range of Norah's 'vocal invention' or her raw abilities as a JAZZ singer.  The stunning elements are to be found in the self-composed titles.  Earthy, organic and sincere, 'Nightingale' is outstanding.  'Come away with me' is unearthly in vision.  In an interview producer Arif Mardin said they had many, many songs to choose from.  It makes one wonder if Norah couldn't have released an even stronger album showcasing her talents as a composer through choosing more original material.  That said, Blue Note is not a pop label and has an obligation to release jazz product.  In that, Norah Jones may be an odd fit.  Did she deserve 5 Grammy's for this?  No, but taking into account the NEW music industry, the sales spike from such an appearance on the Grammy's makes it insanely beneficial.
0767020308|5.0|this is a better adaptation of emma than the gp hollywood film. the characters are better cast, incl emma herself, and the love story between emma and mr knightly is more in evidence. here, it's clear from the get-go that knightly admires emma. in the gp version, jeremy northam's knightly is more of a good friend than a secret admirer. the contrasts between characters also stand out more. mr knightly vs frank churchill, emma vs jane fairfax, emma vs mrs elton, mr knightly vs mr elton, and so on. a good film, even if you're not a big jane austen fan.
0802130208|4.0|The novel A Confederacy of Dunces written by John Kennedy Toole is very unique. This particular novel takes place in New Orleans, one of the most infamous cities in America. New Orleans is generally known for its \\"upbeat\\" life style, which mainly consists of diverse people and parties. This setting alone would cause for a very interesting and original novel, filled with the many adventures...<BR>        The novel starts off with a physical description of the main character, Ignatius J. Reilly, which allows the reader to use their imagination and become interested in the character/surroundings. He is a 34-year-old man that lives at home with his mother, in which he is totally dependant on. Ignatius has a good college education and is smart, however, he has never been able to obtain a long-term job. He has many hopes and dreams of being a writer someday and he often writes, and/or expresses himself in his \\"Big Chiesf Tablets\\". (personal journal) His mother, Irene, is a very nice woman. She takes care of Ignatius and meets his every need. Throughout the novel, one may often find themselves feeling bad for Irene because she spends most of her time waiting on Ignatius \\"hand-and-foot\\" and does not seem to have much of a social life that she can call her own.<BR>        Ignatius is a very unique and unpredictable man. He does not give into the confinements of society, which makes him standout in public. Society often judges Ignatius by his appearance. The reader is able to see this instantaneously in the first chapter when Ignatius is outside on Canal Street, waiting for his mother to return from a doctor appointment for her arthritis. He is just standing there, not doing anything wrong when all of a sudden; a police officer arrests him because he thought that Ignatius looked \\"suspicious\\". This is just one of the circumstances in the novel in which Ignatius is judged.<BR>        Ignatius and his mother, Irene, were very upset with the situation and decided to go and have adrink at a local bar called The Night of Joy. The two of them each consume a few drinks and then they jump in the car where Irene tries to drive while being under the influence of alcohol. She ends up running into a town building and causes a damage of $1, 020. Ignatius is then forced to put aside his hopes and dreams and face reality; he was going to have to find a job to support his mother. After numerous unsuccessful job interviews, Ignatius finally gets a job at a factory called Levy Pants. However, this job did not last for long because Ignatius swas fired after he attempted to assemble and lead the employees of Levy Pants in a demonstration to \\"get rid of\\" Mr. Gonzala. He convinced all of the workers to rebel against Mr. Gonzala due to the low wages, poor working conditions, and long hours at the factory. This demonstration failed. Ignatius then got himself a job with \\"Paradise Hot Dogs\\", being a vendor, where he encountered many new and interesting people. <BR>        Over the course of the novel A Confederacy of Dunces, John Kennedy Toole takes the reader on a unique adventure through the life of Ignatius J. Reilly. Ignatius meets many new people and throughout the novel the reader is able to see the changes in Ignatius's life and the lives of the people that he comes in contact with. This style of writing is very effective in indulging the reader. This novel gets the reader curious as to what comes next in the story, which makes one want to continue reading until the last page of the novel...
0345413377|5.0|I wasn't going to write a review about this book until I read some negative reviews that sadly misrepresent the book, and well, I just want to get the record straight.<br />Just to get it out of the way now, I know it's shocking that he in the second books our protaginist are on a mission against an evil God. I was surprised just as much as anyone else. I remember when I read the passage where Lord Asriel's servant tells how Asriel wants to kill God, and thinking: \\"this guy is totally evil\\", and was surprised to see how we are supposed to support him. Like many of the people who were so insulted by the book I've been raised christian, and my view of God has always been as a loving creator, not some power-hungry evil angel who wants to keep us from enlightenment. After reading this book I still feel the same way. A fantasy novel isn't going to get me to change this opinion. After all, this is a work of fiction people. <br />I seriously doubt that Pullman really sees the world in this way (and even if he does so what), he is just writing a fantasy novel, it's not the real world.<br />Which leads me to the reason why I loved this book. Pullman does more than give us a traditional Good vs. Evil story. By shaking up our views of religion, death, god, angels, and heaven, he leads us to the final message of the story. Just as the true nature of Dust, and the description of the church are gradually infused into the two last books, so is Pullman's call to his reader to enjoy every moment of his life, to cherish the time we have with our loved ones, and endulge in the sensations of this world.<br />And, just for the record I thought the ending was brilliant, the whole time I was waiting for Lyra, and Will to get together, but in the back of my mind I knew, they could never realize their love. Anyways the story can't have a completely happy ending, and like Eve, Lyra can't stay in Paradise with Will: she's eaten the apple from the tree of knowlege, and so has to be thrust intothe real world, Right? And also I just loved the characters, actually there is just too much good stuff, I really can't talk about it all.<br />I know the religious views are harsh, and I do hesitate when reccomending this book to my friends because I don't know how they will feel about the religious content, but if you can manage to get past that and accept that it is only fiction (I mean you were okay with flying witches, talking armored bears, and shape-changing daemons), and follow his ultimate message, you can't really disagree with that, can you? <br />Overall make a choice for yourself, read the book because it is really good, and decide for yourself if the picture of God as an aging angel that never really created man, and the church as a evil angency trying to surpress the people is too much for you, but don't let the people who couldn't get past that aspect of the book scare you off, because like I said before, It is a really good book, I just can't say it enough.
B0000931OG|3.0|As an avid listener to Brit rock, I received the opinion for me to look over this album so I decided to see if it fit the typical Brit punk category or melodic Brit rock (aka Coldplay like).  I find this album while having some great songs mixes way too many elements of rock and other genres in such a small space but also disjointedly spread all over the album.  \\"Ambulance\\" opens the album with a nice beat but seems like a cross between the older stuff of Blur and [the melodic Brit rock]...I'm absolutely annoyed by the kazoo sound too in the center since it totally detracts from the semi-somber sound of the song and the extension of making the song longer is annoying too. \\"Out of Time\\" follows in the similar thread of the quasi-sound of Coldplay and it just seems a cross with a 60's lounge type of vocal arrangement...decent lyrics but totally detracted from by the lounge style.  \\"Crazy Beat\\"...okay, may I'm just a nut but I love that little mechanical sounding thing saying \\"crazy beat\\" and the nice rock of it all reminds me a little bit of much of Blur's first album and I really like this song for some odd reason.  \\"Good Song\\" seems a little reminscient rhythmically of \\"Coffee and TV\\" and I like the swattering sound of this song but it does seem out of place too.  \\"On the Way to the Club\\"...why is it that EVERY band now has this obsession with singing about a club in someone form or fashion...I skip this track first because the beat is just annoying, the lyrics stink, and I'm sick of this topic for a song.  \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" has a 70s feel to it and it even sounds like those drug-induced songs from them (no offense to the band) but that's the feel I get from this song..and the deeper sexy vocals just complicate the song, not enhance it.  \\"Caravan\\" has a nice techno bass beginning to it but it seems poorly recorded with the sound of the song..maybe I'm just too sensitive but this song gets me bored in like 30 seconds.  \\"We've Got a File On You\\"...hmmm, this songis interesting with the Middle Eastern tones in the background and then off course the overlay of classic Blur rock over the lyrics...I like this one too, very innovative and catchy...seems like a \\"taunt\\" too to people and I love that aspect of it too.  \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club\\"...okay that title is too long for a song first of all but the bass and synthetic sounds at the beginning are interesting and I like the progress of the song..top song on the album.  \\"Sweet Song\\" begins with a piano intro (sort of contrasting with the previous song but whatever) and seems like a lullaby..maybe more appropriate to ending the album rather than seeming placed in the middle and following what it does.  \\"Jets\\" has a  twang of the old country Southern charm to it and is instrumental throughout though it does get repetitious as if they are trying to be like Moby but fail miserably at it...keep to the rock boys!  \\"Gene by Gene\\"is an okay song but not stand out either even though the chorus lyrics are nice.  \\"Battery in Your Leg\\" leads off from the previous song too strangely and it sort of bites the big one...blah song and could have been omitted.  \\"My White Noise\\", a hidden bonus track, begins with ephiremal vocals and also violins..reminds me a lot of Coldplay but also incorporates more elements of goth too and it is actually better than the original cut of \\"Battery in Your Leg\\" and the vocals are more passionate it seems..not a bad way to end the album at all.  Overall, there are some gems on this album but it seems very mismatched in placement of the songs first and foremost...secondly, the good songs on this album are the only thing that warrants it three stars because of their innovative nature and also catchy beats too.  However, I would like Blur to keep to their original roots of keeping an original sound rather than trying to sound like supersonic hitters Coldplay as they do attempt on the album.

0380789035|4.0|While American Gods was a very interesting book to read, a number of the references may have escaped some readers. Although most people were taught something about Greek gods in school, this book goes into many different cultures. Since not everyone is familiar with the research Mr. Gaiman did or just hasn't read about that many types of mythology- some people may not appreciate the intricacies. Other than that, the pace dragged some times but it was a good book and very fun to read.

0441009425|5.0|Revelation Space is one of the best SF novels recently written. A archeological dig on an extinct planet reveals pieces of a puzzle suggesting that humankind could be in danger of extermination by forces eons old. The driven, megalomanical leader of the expedition, Dan Sylvestre, is the fulcrum of novel. Reynolds includes two other parallel story lines which initially are a puzzle as they are out of time sequence with Sylvestre. However, he skillfully weaves these strands together into a coherent whole.<br />Some readers may be troubled by the initial shifts in story line. The first 60 pages or so can be confusing, but the author pulls the events and characters together like asteroids dropping into a gravity well. The pieces come together breathlessly and seamlessly. Each layer removed from the plot reveals another even greater mystery, like a Russia Easter egg. Trained in astrophysics, Reynolds has a superb command of the science as well as an outstanding command of the English language. If you liked  books such as Jack McDevitt's &quot;The Engines of God&quot; or Greg Bear's &quot;Eon&quot;, you will love &quot;Revelation Space&quot;.
B00000IQW0|4.0|This movie is classic camp sci-fi given legitimacy by the Star Wars movies.  As melodramatic as it is, it is still a great science fiction adventure that has the emphasis on people.  For the time period and the fact that it was on TV, the effects were quite good.<br />One of the best parts is seeing a lot of famous actors playing roles in the infancy of their careers.
6301404440|5.0|I would guess everyone in the world has seen this film at least once, but if YOU haven't, DO IT NOW!!!  (in a perfect world those words would pulse out at you and turn several color shades-maybe a rubber mallet would jump from the screen and pop you on the forehead for emphasis).  Only a couple of the reviews I've read allude to the influence of Bob Evans' (and Roman Polanski's) Chinatown on Who Framed Roger. . .   If you haven't seen Chinatown, do, then watch Roger again-it's even more hilarious.

0671015206|3.0|I've heard about this book for years but finally got down to reading it this past weekend.  There is some good info in the book (Never have a mortgage that is more than 2X your annual household income, thoughts on intergenerational wealth transfer) but overall I found the book tedious and very repetitive.  The authors conducted a survey of high net worth individuals throughout the country and the book is an endless string of statistical data points described multiple ways.  In my opinion the study they conducted leads them to some inappropriate conclusions that are way too generalized.  For example the book states an equation to determine whether you are a prodigious accumulator of wealth (PAW) or an under accumulator of wealth (UAW).  The formula is this: 1/10*your age*your current salary.  If your current net worth is greater than the result you are a PAW, if not you are a loser, I mean, UAW.  The equation would seem to be reasonably accurate for those nearing retirement, but it is utterly useless for those just starting out in life (A 21 year old fresh out of college with a $30,000 job doesn't have $63,000 in net worth without some intergenerational wealth transfer from the parents/grandparents).<br />In my view the surprising secrets disclosed in this book can be summed up as, \\"If you want to be wealthy make a lot of money and don't spend any of it.\\" There is a certain degree of wisdom in this, but its similar in my mind to the statement, \\"If you want to be safe build yourself a nuclear bomb shelter and never leave it.\\"  Neither statement is too close to the realities most of us deal with.<br />My advice to help you on your path to millions is pick up the few insights that are available from this book at the library.
0156027321|5.0|This book worked on two levels for me. One, the basic narrative drive of the story pulled me ferociously to turn each page as if I needed to read the next one. Like a drug. The story was so compelling I couldn't put it down. You have to be a very good writer to sustain any reader's attention over what is essentially little narrative elements. The charm of the novel is that it manages to be both epic and intimate at the same time.<br />But to go back to my initial point, the second level was a metaphorical one. I found myself strangely responding to the novel's more parable-like qualities. In the best sense, the novel creates its own distinct world and makes you question the choices the characters make at every turn. I apologize for the big questions: Isn't life a big ocean of uncertainty? Aren't we, spiritually, alone in an indifferent universe? Aren't we presented with the choice to believe, survive or lose hope?  <br />And what I found interesting from the author's introduction was that, like Cervantes did DON QUIXOTE, the author sets up a sense of disbelief, which he pays off at the end in the last part of the book (where Pi is interviewed by the two Japanese employees). Are we to believe Pi's story at face value? Or perhaps is his own retelling of his story in \\"dry facts\\" closer to the truth? Each reader must make a choice or chose not to make one. In either case,  the novel invites another reading. And when you finish your second reading, you're invited for yet another one and so on, infinately.  It gives you a sense of continuity, of kinship. It's not a dull continium, but rather a very pleasant view of life. Experience this novel. You won't regret it.
0064407667|4.0|When I first heard about the Unfortunate Events books, my first reaction was negative.  I assumed the books were depressing, painful tales that would likely give kids nightmares and send them screaming to therapists.  So I read one...and I was wrong.<br />`The Bad Beginning' chronicles the misadventures of three very...well, unfortunate...orphans: fourteen year old Violet (who longs to invent things), twelve year old Klaus (who longs to read books), and the infant girl Sunny (who longs to bite things...and people).  As author Lemony Snicket warns on the book's back cover, this is \\"an unhappy tale about three very unlucky children.\\"  That it certainly is, but it is also much more. <br />The book can be viewed as a dark comedy for children, a fairy tale gone wrong, or Charles Dickens meets Harry Potter.  Snicket moves the story forward with a fast-paced plot and many vocabulary lessons inserted throughout the story in very clever ways.  <br />Many people may be critical of the Unfortunate Events books, citing that there are no happy endings.  But life doesn't always turn out nice and neat like it did in the Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and Little House on the Prairie books.  There's nothing wrong with those books, but maybe they're not your thing.  If that's the case, maybe the Unfortunate Events books will be more to your liking.
0060920084|2.0|I understand that Bill wrote this book from an English point of view, even though he was born in Iowa. And although I have to agree that we have a country full of fat people, strip malls, bad food, sleazy advertisements and in-your-face cheap touristy places, there are some beautiful regions in this country that Bill completely overlooked.<br />He not once talked personally to a bartender, waitress, other tourist about why they were where they were.  (What brought someone to live in Why Not, Mississsippi, for instance).  He never spoke to a native American, to a Black Southerner, etc.  He never gave a reason for any place to exist.<br />This book may have some funny moments, but it lacks an intimate, personal aspect.  Everything Bill writes about is fat, boring, cheap or tasteless.  Maybe all the cheap beer he drank every night ended up influencing his attitude?  I have travelled to many of the same places he has seen and loved them all for the diversity.  How can South Carolina be boring?  Or even New Hampshire?<br />Surely this book is a hit in Europe right now, though, but here in the US this book ranks the worst of Bill's writings.  I am glad I borrowed this book from the county library; it's a waste of money.
0790734850|5.0|What do you get when Hollywood heavyweights like Kevin Spacey, Russel Crowe, Dani DeVito, James Cromwell and Guy Pearce combine forces and get involved in a movie with an excellent script? An instant hit movie, that's what.<br />Set in a 1950's surrounding, the movie shows LA's finest, the LAPD, as it once was. Corrupt, and struggling to make it's city a safer place of residence for it's citizens. <br />After a shootout at a restaurant in which Bud White's (Crowe) ex-partner is killed, the LAPD quickly busts a couple of black kids for it, who manage to escape, and in turn get shot by Edmund Exley (Pearce) who becomes the city's hero.<br />Gradually, though, they find out that the three kids were in fact not related to the shooting, and they become entangled in a web of intrigue involving a rich millionaire running an escort service with girls who resemble moviestars. <br />White ends up with one of those, Lyn Bracken (Played by Kim Basinger, who got an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the part), while Exley sides with Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Spacey), an officer who is mostly interested in getting some fame on a TV-show, and who is 'fed' stories by a sleazy reporter (DeVito).<br />Though friction exists between all of them, they somehow are dealing with cases that are connected to one another, and they soon find out that in order to unravel the big picture, they will have no choice but to cooperate.<br />The many plot-twists will make sure that for a long time the viewer will be kept guessing as to who-dunnit, and the characters were wonderfully cast. It's the classic story of bad-cop turns good-cop and vice versa, but with an unpredictable end. The actors all show amazing performances, and you cannot help but feel sympathetic for some, and loathsome towards others.<br />All in all, it's well worth the view!
0553296981|5.0|Anne Frank's diary has moved millions around the world, past and present, with it's honesty, depth, and poignancy. (Personally, it was Anne's diary that motivated me to write my own journal as a young girl and I continue to write faithfully, ever since. It is one of the few books that I've read which has had the greatest influence on my life.) Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl living in Amsterdam, along with her family, went into hiding along with her family during WWII, when Holland was annexed by the Nazis Regime. During the long years of secret captivity in the building's attic, Anne captured her hopes, loves, fears and thoughts on life in her diary, where she affectionately addressed her entries to an imaginary friend she named \\"Kitty\\".<br />Despite the horrible reality of war just outside her window, Anne was a person who could see beyond man's inhumanity to man, and perceive true beauty and the gift of life. Tragically, nearing the war's conclusion, the family's hiding place is mercilessly betrayed to the Nazis...which ultimately culminates in the final chapter of this lovely young girl's life, just prior to liberation. This is a true story...a diary of a young girl....and her voice from the past. It's a memoir of a brilliant and deep being who wasn't afraid to hope for something better, beyond the misery surrounding her. In my opinion, it is a book that every person should read.<br />It was an overcast day on Saturday, March 9, 2002. I stood just outside of Anne Frank's final dwelling place, the \\"Secret Annex,\\" at Prinsengracht 263, Amsterdam. I was overcome with great sadness as I gazed up at the small attic window where she must have looked out...a tree-lined canal just across the way. Perhaps she watched the ducks in the water, swallows overhead, the steady sloping of the rain, or the cloud formations....day in and day out. I imagined what it would be like to be a young girl in confinement, yearning to enjoy life amidst the free, only to be shut up, and kept quiet for fear that an audible breath would betray my family's whereabouts and terminate our lives. I wept at the great waste of life, the cruelty, the plundering of innocent lives, and how this amazing young woman maintained the inner strength to endure those years...and had the courage to capture it all with such delicacy, calm candor and beauty.quiet for fear that an audible breath would betray my family's whereabouts and terminate our lives.

B00005QDW5|4.0|I don't want to be disrespectful to the current line-up because however I feel about their post Waters work these guys were involved in the making of some of my favorite music of all time. That having been said I have to ask how can they seriously justify putting five post Waters tracks on this compilation. Other reviewers have questioned the lack of 'Welcome to the Machine' and 'Have a Cigar'. That's a valid point but the inclusion of these two would mean that the entire 'Wish You Were Here' lp would be represented. I can't imagine that any real Floyd fan would question the decision to put parts one through seven of 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' on here and the title track really can't be denied so what can they do? This isn't a box set. I can understand that bands want their best of compilations to span their entire careers and I don't think it's a coincidnce that there are five Barrett songs represented here as well. The difference is that the Barrett stuff is brilliant but the post Waters just doesn't hold up. Waters' solo stuff is much better (even 'Radio Kaos'). 'High Hopes' is especially painful listening. Its inferiority only highlighted by its sandwiching between two stellar Barrett tracks. I think it's reasonable of them to include only one post Waters tune and in exchange for that they should have included a Waters' solo tune. Whether or not it contains the name Pink Floyd it IS the real Pink Floyd that has been etched into my brain. 'Pros and Cons' is in the same league as 'The Wall'. I would have included 'Waiting for the Worms', 'Not Now John', 'Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict' (from Ummagumma) and 'If' (from Atom Heart Mother). Including, 'When the Tigers Broke Free' previously only in the movie version of 'The Wall' is a good choice and not just an attempt to get die hard fans to buy the whole set for one track. In truth, this track really gets into the heart of late Waters' era Floyd. If you know anything about their music and listen to the lyrics and to the sound you'll realize that this is truely a great Pink Floyd song that belongs on a best of compilation. The blending of the songs together works well and makes the album more interesting and more coherent. Some fans point out that Floyd records should be listened to in their entirety and I agree that it's important to listen to their music that way if you really want to understand it. However, that doesn't mean that their individual tracks can't hold up alone. It's also cool to just take the songs one at a time. By the way, Pink Floyd's best record is 'Animals'.
B00008PW2D|2.0|I absolutely love Sex and the City. I have been a fan from the very beginning and was really shocked and disappointed by the fifth season. We are talking about 8 episodes, all of which seem to be grasping at straws. An example? In one episode, Miranda has become so self conscitious about her baby weight that she joins weight watchers. While there she meets a man who himself is fighting the battle of the bulge. The do become romantically involved. During a particularly randy romp Miranda notices that the guy has gotten \\"love juice\\" all over his face. Miranda knew the guy was a sloppy eater but this was ridiculous. She basically found him repulsive. From my point of view, that whole episode was tasteless and crude. Im sorry Darren Starr hasnt been able to get the girls in better situations. I am looking forward to the show's end, its basically time for it. Nobody can live as wide open as these girls forever. I just hope they bring back Chris Noth. <BR>Season 4 was by far the best of all 5 seasons.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I am amazed at the reviews here citing Norah Jones as \\"marginally talented\\", \\"boring\\", or (gasp!) \\"dreadful\\".  I couldn't disagree more!  I first heard this album in a friend's car, and immediately fell in love with it. I was instantly enthralled by the simplicity and beauty of the music, the ethereal quality of her voice, and the understated power of the lyrics.  I not only bought a copy for myself, but also for my three closest friends and my mom. It's one of the best albums I've listened to in YEARS and I highly recommend it. I'm not a Hank Williams fan, and was pleasantly surprised that Norah did such a wonderful, and in my opinion BETTER, rendition of his song \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\".  I've never heard a song more beautiful and mesmerizing than \\"Come Away With Me\\".  \\"Turn Me On\\" is incredibly sexy.  There is not one performance on this album that I don't truly enjoy every single time I hear it.  I'm never tempted to fast forward to the next track, because every song is terrific. It's near impossible to pick a favorite, but \\"Shoot the Moon\\" does slightly edge out the others.  This is my CD of choice when I want to relax and unwind.  Well done, Norah.
B000000OAN|5.0|This album hurts it's so good! It's considered Queen's masterpiece and it's easy to see why. Although Queen II is my favorite, this is one fine piece of work. Yeah, everyone knows Bohemian Rhapsody(unless you lived in a cave throughout the resurrection of the song in 92, or when it first came out), and it is a great song, but there is so much more to Queen than just that song. In fact, I usually skip that track-not that it's bad by any means, but because I'm still played out on it!!  Even with that said, this is one of those albums with not one skippable track. The whole thing is fantastic. Queen are so good at touching down on different styles and sounds, but keeping their signature sound the whole time. The title is quite accurate, coz this album sounds like a hard rock opera/ballet/broadway musical. It's easy to see why power metal kings Blind Guardian(who also have an album titled \\"Night At The Opera\\") regard Queen as their favorite band and number one influence. If you happen to listen to Blind Guardian, you must check out Queen. There is ALOT of Queen's sound in them. If you know what's good for ya, you'd better finish your cappucino, then run out and get \\"A Night At The Opera.\\"
0192833588|3.0|The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty. Nevertheless, even though it is not Austen's best written work, it is still a very amiable novel and a nice light read for any classics buff.
0792844939|1.0|Robert DeNiro's character of Jimmy Doyle is, without a doubt, the most unlikeable and downright despicable character in film history.  <br />He (DeNiro's character) does absolutely nothing in the film's nearly three hour running time to in ANY way ingratiate the audience to himself. He's an absolutely horrendous human being in every single scene. (Honestly, Hannibal Lechter is more likeable than this guy...at least Hannibal had some charm and an occasional sense of humor.:)<br />Liza Minnelli is wonderful, however, as is the set design,  cinematography and music.  But you can't have a successful film when the audience despises one of the two main characters.

0553213105|5.0|A novel I have read and re-read, and will continue to do so with great gusto - every time, falling hopefulessly in love with the characters all over again. It is by far, my favorite.<br />Published in 1813 and premiered under the title First Impressions, Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" stands as one of the most universally loved and admired novels of English literature. Not only is it a tale of rural romance, but also a witty and shrewdly observed satire of English country life.<br />The story takes place in a remote Hertfordshire village, in George III's England. Mr. Bennett, a country squire of no great means, endeavors to marry off his five vivacious daughters. At the heart of all this all-consuming enterprise are his headstrong second daughter, Elizabeth Bennett and her aristocratic suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy - two lovers whose pride must be humbled and prejudices dissolved before the novel can come to it's splendid conclusion.
B000089RVX|4.0|So, I looked at the CD cover. Slightly egotistical front cover with a woman's face looking just a bit distorted. Blue tinted, looks like she had dreads, a few piercings. Okay, so we're going to hear a lot of this women telling us stuff, probably stuff about how much love stinks.<br />Look at the back of the CD cover. Grainy, out of focus images of guys posturing. So, they'll be providing the noise, and probably quite a bit of it.<br />Look at the little blurb provided by my friendly retail chain. Two songs are on a soundtrack to a movie I haven't watched. I listen to one of them, &quot;Bring Me To Life.&quot; Cool stuff. Not overworked, though the lyrics are a little dramatic for my taste. Then, on to track 7, which always seems to be the producer's least favourite track. In this case, &quot;Imaginary,&quot; not a half bad track at all. If that's as bad as it gets, this ought to be good.<br />So, I buy it. Surprise, surprise, hardly a song on here I'm going to sick of in a hurry. Not a perfect CD, but if you ignore the hype and just listen to the music, it's a good CD.<br />I give it four stars for two outstanding tracks: &quot;Bring Me Back to Life&quot; and &quot;Tourniquet.&quot; The former is the most studio-produced, and sounds suitably lush and stringy. The latter is quite a bit more raw and emotional.
B00005JMFR|5.0|This was the greatest movie ever.  Even better than the Matrix Reloaded.  The special effects were out of this world.  A must see.  You have to see the previous two to even come close to understanding this one though.  Neo being a computer programmer was a flip for me, but the idea of them being in a Matrix within in a Matrix was pretty cool though.  Trinity was even hotter in this seen especially with the love seen at the end when Neo was leaving.
6305907145|1.0|If you love Jane Austen stories, as the British say, \\"Give this one a miss!\\"  Our heroine, Fanny, is terribly mis-characterized (as compared with the book, and after all, what else is one to compare it with?); so too, her benefactor, Sir Thomas.  Fanny is made out to be somewhat bold-instead of timid- and the Bertram scion is portrayed as positively mean.  If these changes to Austen's brilliant story aren't travesty enough, this screenwriter chose to make the story into a campaign against Slavery--a theme never touched upon by Austen-on the flimsy excuse that the Bertrams have financial interests in Antigua.  To give you an idea of just how far-fetched and far-afield this is, try to picture the lovely movie, Emma Thompson's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as being turned into a rant about the Abuses and Excesses of The Church of England, merely because one of the central characters wants to be a vicar!  It's a clear case of taking too much 21st century liberty with a 200 year-old story.
0452282152|4.0|It is not a coincidence that I read this touching novel while abroad in Holland. I felt it would've added much to the story, being in the country of it's setting. And so it did! I couldn't put the book down as much I tried. (So much for sleep!) The story revolves around 14-year-old Griet, the daughter of a tile maker in 17th century Holland. When her father is blinded and no longer able to care for his family's needs, Griet must find work to support the family. She obtains employment as a servant in the Vermeer household, with the famous Dutch artist Johanne Vermeer as her employer. The story is beautifully written, as seen through Griet's eyes - the complex family she is thrust into the midst of, the society of the small town of Delft, and life with an obsessive artistic genius. Griet loves being drawn into Vermeer's abstract life and ultimately becomes one of his models - as the &quot;girl with a pearl earring.&quot; A fascinating novel that I would highly recommend to history-related fiction buffs, or anyone who is just plain interested in a personal and touching tale.
0316666343|4.0|This book grabs you from the first paragraph. I don't want to ruin any of the story line, so I won't go in to what the book is about. I will just say that Sebold approaches death in a different way than any other author I have read. Good character development, too.  I really enjoyed this book. A good summer read, and I would recommend it.
B00008VGK0|1.0|The title of this should be &quot;Anti-American Life&quot;, because Madonna is about as American as crumpets and scones and Earl Grey tea! This is her most unimpressive CD of all time... it seems that Madonna herself is bored half out of her mind singing the cloying tunes she penned! The whole mess has absolutely no direction and if she scores a Top 10 hit in the US from this, I'd be very surprised! I have not heard the title track played one time on any radio station! The title &quot;American Life&quot; is a trick, to lure Americans to buy her CD and help support her lavish lifestyle! Don't be fooled by her trickery this time! Just remember how Madonna used to be, circa 1986!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie is an excellent film.  Keep in mind, this movie is the anime style. If you prefer traditional, &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot;, easy to follow animated films, this movie probably isn't for you. I found that I could watch this movie more than once and get something different out of it each time.  I really appreciate that in a film.  However, it does have the ever so common flaw, which happens in a lot of anime productions, of being rushed plot-wise in some places [the ending, namely]. They probably ran out of time and/or budget. The english dubbing isn't bad...I've heard worse.  However, if you have a chance, do watch it in Japanese. All in all this movie is a wonderful, beautiful movie that is well worth adding to your collection.
0060194995|5.0|Like most young ones my age, I read and studied \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" in junior high school. But this story has stuck with me through the years, and every time I flip through it's pages, I look back on it with affection. This classic tale of courage and altruism is timeless.<br />It is the early 1950's in the southern states. A highly respected small-town lawyer decides to take on a case defending a framed African American man, although he knows he will not win the trial. The lawyer must face the ridicule of the town's folk, and racists in his community who seek to have the framed man killed.<br />In the meantime, the lawyer's two children (Scout and Jem) get entangled in the age-long mystery of Boo Radley, their mysterious next door neighbor who no one has seen for years...and who no one seems to understand.<br />\\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" is a touching story full of life-lessons, one of which proves that fighting a losing battle may be difficult, but \\"good\\" will ultimately triumph if you stand up for what you know to be right and true.
0618260293|5.0|I love these books. I love these books. I love these books.<br />I am not a fan of science fiction or fantasy as one would typically classify a Tolkien fan.  But these stories are classic because the themes are classic--good vs. evil, loyalty, family, love, duty. Only Tolkien can make the reader truly love and identify with such mythical characters such as dwarfs, elves, and hobbits. Within these odd beings, the strengths and weaknesses of humans are characterized.<br />Above all, these stories are epic. No other books make my heart race and my palms sweat like Lord of the Rings. There are moments that I have to close the book just to take it all in. <br />For background, read The Hobbit, another amazing Tolkien classic that is pretty much a prequel to LOTR.
B000002WPI|5.0|yo check this right here man basically this cd is the best hip hop album i have ever heard, I listen to this cd almost every day i just can't get enough of it.  The beats are great, the lyrics are untouchable and the styles are the most unique ever.  If you are a big rap fan and you do not own this piece then you need to do something and quick otherwise you got some problems. I am probably wu-tang's biggest fan right now, they inspire me so much i just cannot see how anybody can dislike them. The best songs on this cd i would have to say are: 7th chamber, clan in da front, shame on a n***a, aint nothin to f*** wit, and M-E-T-H-O-D Man!              Peace
B00005B36H|4.0|There are better albums by tool than this like undertow or aenima. This cd isn't bad at all, it just isn't really the tool I know and love. &quot;The grudge&quot; is my favorite song on here. The cd is still good but don't get it unless your a realy hardcore tool fan.
B0000029GA|3.0|ok ok I know most people think this album is a classic but I gotta disagree....Nas has never put out a classic and never will.  &quot;God's Son&quot; is clearly his best album but cannot be considered on the same level as &quot;Chronic 2001&quot;, &quot;Eminem Show&quot;, &quot;Reasonable Doubt&quot;, &quot;The Blueprint&quot; or the best album of all time &quot;All Eyez On Me&quot;  Nas has ordinary beats with decent lyrics but is totally overrated as an artist....don't get me wrong I like his style on certain tracks but he is not capable of putting a completely solid disc together the whole way through.
B00006690G|4.0|I have a love/hate relationship with Eminem. Let me explain:<br />The love:<BR>I have a lot of repsect for Eminem as a rapper. I would even go on to say that he's one of the top 10 MC's of all time. He<BR> has learned well from the rappers that inspired him, with his use of wordplay reminiscent of Big Daddy Kane, 2Pac, Kool G. Rap, Rakim and The Notorious B.I.G. Though this is a good album ,it's not his best; that honor still goes to the Marshall Mathers LP. His best work is still yet to come.<br />The hate:<BR>With that all being said, I still have a problem with Eminem. I know this has been brought up many times, but I will do it again. Despite all his remarkable lyrical ability, the only reason he is near or at the top of the rap game is because he is a white person<BR>diong black music; it's that simple. He even refrences it on \\"Without Me\\" by saying he's \\"the worst thing since Elvis Presley to do black music so selfishly and use it to make myself wealthy\\". I couldn't have said it better myself, Slim. I don't dislike him; like I said before, I respect him as a rapper, but there are black rappers who are equally as talented if not more<BR> talented as he is who wouldn't get his props(Mos Def, talib Kweli, Black Thought, Method Man, Redman, Jay-Z and Nas when they're motivated, etc.)His sucess is a product of hype and marketing, which explains<BR>his predominately white fan base, half of which are of the Brtney Spears/NSYNC variety(white females) and rock fans who may not listen or know a lot about hip hop, but they like him because he's not one of \\"those\\" (code word) rappers(white males). I wish it wasn't all bout color, but that day, sadly, hasn't come yet.

0684833395|2.0|Catch -22 seemed like it would be interesting and different.  From reading the book jacket this looked like an interesting book and I looked forward to reading it.  As I was reading it, I changed my mind; I thought that this was a terrible book.<br /> The book took place during WWII.  The main character was Yossarian, who tried to run away from anything that he thought would turn into a problem.  He never faced his fears or responsibilities.  Whenever he did something that he thought was good something else happened and wound up causing something bad to happen. Damned if you do damned if you don't either way you don't win. So much so that the term \\"being in a Catch-22 situation\\" has become a part of everyday language.<br /> Snowden was a friend and inspiration for Yossarian.  By the end of the book Yossarian had to choose between himself and others.  Yossarian cared about this boy very much.  Snowden's wartime death shocked him.  He had always run away from the missions, he never dropped bombs, he just got the air hours on his record.  He hated being in the army and wanted to leave, he did not want to die.  Yet after his friend died he decided to help hid friends and run away.  <BR> <BR> For most of the book Yossarian is a patient in a military hospital.  All he does when he is there is pick on the staff and other patients.  But when his friend Orr picks on Yossarian he gets mad, but never defends himself.   He is afraid to die.  When he is in the hospital he acts like everyone is out to kill him and thinks that all the people in the hospital are crazy.<br /> I think Yossarian was a capable person who got in his own way when he tried to do anything.   He would run from his responsibilities instead of facing them.  At the end of the book he proved to himself that he was running from his responsibilities and finally ran toward them.  He faced his responsibilities by going to help his friends when he rejected an offer that he had been asking for because he didn't wantto lie.  Until then he had been a very selfish man and only wanted to save himself and his close friends in the process.<br /> I think that this book was too long and that it could have been better in less words.  This book did not hit home with me as I thought it would.
B000089A07|5.0|To be honest, this movie only interested me because Edward Norton was in it.  Silence of the Lambs was disgusting, and Hannibal was a waste of 2 hours of my life, and I was a fan of neither one.  I didn't expect Red Dragon to stray far from the gore, and other disgusting elements as seen in the first 2.  I just wanted to see Edward.<br />Well, I'm glad I did.  This movie is excellent.  A great prequel.  You find out why Hannibal is imprisoned (like you didn't know...but still).  <br />Too many people complain that it's not close enough to the book.  Well, the writers have to interpret it, and when writing the script, they may interpret it differently from you.  How many movies have you seen that were exactly like the book?  <br />Ok, so in the book, and in Manhunter, Will Graham is the main character.  Yes, that may be true, but how much success did Manhunter attain?  What's a movie in the Lecter series without Lecter?  Lecter has a creepiness about him essential to the movies.  <br />Everyone did a great acting job in this movie.  This movie was well written, and entertaining, and, as a prequel should do, stands on it's own as a movie.<br />Everyone tends to enjoy the original more.  Remember, this IS the original.<br />Great movie, 5 stars.  Good job.
B00005A46T|4.0|This cd isn't as good as the first but still great. It is kind of the same thing as the last album: screaming, loudness, and etc. The cd still rocks though. The vocals seem to have matured a bit and gotten a bit deeper. Buy this cd!!!!!!!!!
B00008H2LB|2.0|The first time i listend to 'Meteora' it was the typical 'ooh, ahh, wow, this is great'. But then after listened to it for a while it started to grow really old, really fast. Linkin Park's first Release 'Hybrid Theory' was too good and was pretty much one of the best CD's i have heard. Meteora on the other hand, drags on way to much. The repetition of annyoing, high-pitched, not close to metal or hard rock, samples brought it down a lot. In songs like, &quot;Lying from you&quot;, &quot;Feint&quot;, and &quot;Session&quot;, the samples literaly are the worst sounds i have ever heard. The Lyrics are often bland and un-interesting, as if they were put together without thought and egotisticly. In 'Hybrid Theory', there were many lyrical masterpeices such as &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;Crawling&quot;, &quot;Run Away&quot;, &quot;A Place for my Head&quot;, &quot;Pushing me Away&quot;, and others. The only lyrics in this CD i found interesting were &quot;From the Inside&quot;, and &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot;. Meteora isn't the same Hardcore, Screaming, Rapping, Metal, band I heard on Hybrid Theory. My Reccomendation: Linkin Park are turning into Sell-Outs right before our eyes, dont waste your money.

B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is a weird, yet brilliant, combination of a child's fairy tale and early films by Jean-Luc Godard.  Maybe the plot isn't something Godard would approve of, or at least make (it's sappy and deals a lot with fantastic notions of fate).  But the playful nature in which Amelie deconstructs the components of cinema, is pure Godard.  The editing, use of sound, screen composition, all very playful, very critical, very calculated and perfect.<br />And for someone that cringes at the thought of a sappy love story (Godard's Breathless is more to my liking as a love story), Amelie left me with a ear to ear grimace for hours after leaving the theater (each of the FOUR times I saw this).  In an age that movies don't seem to touch new ground, everything seems so bland, nothing has been as fresh as the early French New Wave, until Amelie...
B00005B4GU|4.0|Did you listen to OK Computer (for perhaps the hundredth time) and think, &quot;where will these guys go next?&quot;? Did you wait for the answer secretly hoping that it would alienate many of their fans, expose them as fickle populists? Do you like moody electronica? If yes to at least 2 of these questions, buy this album. Simple as that.
B00005JLD4|3.0|Who would have guessed that Australia, of all places, would have such race purifying regulations in place until as recently as 1970?  These regulations allowed the Australian government to abduct any half-castes (mix-breed, Aboriginal/Caucasion) and relocate them into camps, not only to force western culture, religion and language upon them, but also to prevent them from mating with full-blood aboriginals in order to cleanse the aboriginal culture into non-existence.  Trust me, you won't believe it, even after you see it.<br />Technically, Rabbit-Proof Fence is a chase movie, utilizing many of the Hollywood conventions of close-calls, miscues, and a soundscape that adds to the tensions tenfold.  The film is also so much more, especially emotionally, with wonderfully developed characters (this is often over-looked in Hollywood chase movies).<br />The three half-caste girls (Sampi, Sansbury and Monaghan) give some of the most natural child performances in cinema, especially considering that during a majority of the film they only have each other to play off of.  They truly give the film a natural, honest, documentary feel which adds so much to the emotional impact.  Branagh, though not very \\"natural\\", brilliantly portrays the man behind the cleansing scheme, a man that could quite easily hang with Hitler and hold his own in conversations about the ways and means to white supremecy.<br />Its so nice to see something this fresh and touching, a film that doesn't come up roses in the end, but still leaves with much hope and heart.  Sure Rabbit-Proof Fence is saturated with political and social issues, but in the end it really is a story of over-coming the odds and surviving in such an ugly, angry world.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Now I have been a Ben Harper fan fairly recently but yet have been able to purchase all of his LP's.  FOrtunately for me just as I started getting into Harper he puts out a record three or four months later.  <br />Now having heard all of ben's material, I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible for any sane person to pick a favourite album of Ben's, for each album offers something different and expands on his ever growing arsenal of muscianship tricks.<br />For all these so called Ben purists it's like you never want to see a muscian evolve.  Yes the wiesenborn of Ben's is quiet soemthing, the acoustics with his sweet melodies were soemthing of devine proportions.  But the fact is, that well Ben has more then just folk influences and he likes to express himself in various ways.  Really, a man not affraid to step out of the box and risk his cult fan base for simply wanting to expand muscially, well he should be commended.<br />Every song on here works.  From With my own, to When it's good, touch of you lust amazing song, and well everything works.  The song everything which people seem to think is horrible because of it's lyrics have to really look at the true beauty amonst the simplicity he uses in that song.  For the first time ben hits the markls with all his rockers, and one the only trip up on this album is Bring the funk.  I love brown eyed, so don't say I hate funk, or don;'t udnerstand it.<br />But man, Ben is a master.  This man can do it all.  Yes to some degree this may be his most commercial effort, but in that same token it's his most adventurous effort.  In a time when tturly inspired uplifting poetic music is needed ben delievers, without a shadow of a doubt.
1573225517|4.0|This book was hilarious, with tight, sharp dialogue between characters that everyone has met (unless you live under a rock and have never ventured into a quirky record (or comics, videos, cards, hobby, etc.) store).  The interplay between Barry (the jaded know-it-all), Dick (the caring introvert) and painfully over-analytical Rob, is priceless.  Hi Fidelity reads like an afternoon spent hanging out in a record store, shooting the breeze and ragging on one another, all to a cool soundtrack.<br />Everything important to Rob gets reduced to a spot on a series of ever-changing lists, many of which appear in the book (and even dictate its flow in parts).  He waxes nerdily philosophical about his love life, just as the rest of us do, except he does it according to a priority list he keeps close to his heart.  The story in part is about his efforts to revisit women on his list of girlfriends, to see what insight he gleans about himself in the process of recalling what they found attractive about him back in the day.  Interesting plot, great execution.<br />The music in Hi Fidelity is spot-on, and it's clear that Hornby knows what he is talking about.  Who among us doesn't know a guy or two that is a little too much into music, to the point where he can't stop talking about it, and chooses his friends and love interests more or less according to the films and albums they are interested in?  Hi Fidelity- joyfully, hysterically- is a story about one of those guys.<br />If you saw this movie first, as I did, you will not be able to read the dialogue without visualizing John Cusack and Jack Black- the film was so great and so true to the book, and the actors so-well cast.  Whether that's a good thing or bad, you be the judge; if you liked one, you'll love the other.

0805062971|4.0|This is the only book I've read that moved faster, and that left more to the imagination, than its movie.  The two were extremely alike, but the movie used its special effects and cool visuals to flesh out the streamlined storyline of the print version.  Also, the movie was much more violent, since the story never goes into too much detail about anything, leaving the gory minutiae for the wide screen.  Fight Club's (the book) dialog was quick-moving, the scenes were tightly described and without extraneous detail, and rarely was there inner-dialog that lasted longer than a few paragraphs.  The whole experience was an adrenaline rush akin to the by-now familiar basement brawls that made Fight Club more of a phenomenon than a book and a movie.  This is an excellent joyride of a read for the beach or a bus trip: an action-packed adventure that has a big payoff without requiring any cerebral cortex of the reader.<br />What a great story line, too.  A covert fight club, created by yuppies disenchanted with their sterilized existence and in need of testosterone, catches steam and spirals into madness, threatening world domination before it is through.  Fight Club has enough cool and subversive elements to read like an primer in underground education, without the didacticism.  Very cool is the story of multiple personalities told in the first person.  My only criticism about the book (and the movie) is that the plot was so big and brazen that it could have fueled two stories in this age of sparse ideas: one about the fight club itself, and another about the multiple-personalities of the narrator-slash-Tyler Durden.  Better to have two excellent stories to tell than none, I suppose.
B000083C49|4.0|I think by now, most people have a pretty good idea what The Voyage Home is about. (Kirk and Crew travel back in time to find some Whales to save the future.)<br />So lets get down to the details. This is a great movie. It's one of Star Trek's finest outings on the big screen. It's considered by many to be one of the best Trek movies. I'd give the movie itself 5 stars, but the transfer isn't all it's cracked up to be. The transfer of STIII:TSFS seems, to me, to be far greater than this one. If you view it on a small set, you might not notice it, but pop this baby in a state of the art 52\\" HDTV plasma screen, and you start to notice tons of annoying little [things] that could have easily been taken care of if they had paid a bit more attention, money, and detail to restoring this great movie by giving it the treatment it deserves. Paramount obviously feels they can just cut corners though, and the target audience will eat it up anyway. (Which, I guess, was likely spot on...) But it's a shame that they didn't. The Voyage Home deserved better. The Commentary by Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner is a great addition however, and does give you a nice reason to view it a second time, and the other extras on the second disc are all pretty decent and standard stuff for the Special Edition ST DVD's.
B00003CXDV|5.0|My friends and I couldn't believe how funny this movie was when we saw it recently for the first time, and we all agreed that it was horribly marketed at the time of its initial release.  This is not a cutsie kids' flic like the usual Tim Allen fare (The Santa Clause, etc.)- this is a sophisticated comedy with excellent performances from a talented cast.  Tony Shaloub is excellent; Sam Rockwell is excellent; Allan Rickman steps outside the box in which he's usually cast and gives a hilariously dry, stuffy performance; Tim Allen captures both the hubris and the genuine love of craft that a young William Shatner embodied, before he become a mere satire; all of the aliens (the Thermians) are a riot.  And who knew Sigourney Weaver was hot?  There is as much subtle performance as there is over-the-top slapstick material; basically, GQ offers something for every fan of good comedy.<br />If you are a science fiction fan or can identify with that culture, the movie is an even bigger score.  It perfectly captures the dorkiness of science fiction conventions, and does an excellent job of parodying obsessed fans, without ever making them the object of ridicule.  The special effects rock, too, providing confirmation that the excellent script and story line weren't compromised by slapdash production.<br />I have watched  Galaxy Quest several times by now, and show it any time I have friends over who haven't seen it or even heard of it.  It pleases each and every time.  A totally underrated classic.
B00004T6V4|5.0|\\"The Flame Still Burns,\\" for anyone who's ever been a performer of any kind, this film makes you feel young again.  \\"Still Crazy\\" touches all of those of us who thought they left it all behind, but find it's still there.  The film is about a 70's rock band, Strange Fruit, which packs it in amidst the death of its singer, drug abuse and general acrimony.  But Stephen Rea (fabulous performance) digs the remnants of the band out of retirement for a reunion show.  The old tensions return, but the music propels the gang past all that in the end.  In addition, the mystery of the band's missing guitarist Brian (Bruce Robinson) is solved, and his reunion with his old girlfriend will make the hardest hearts cry.  Excellent performances as well by Jimmy Nail (Lez), Juliet Aubrey (Karen), Billy Connally (Hughie) and Bill Nighy (hilarious as the pretentious burnout singer, Ray).  Killer soundtrack with original tunes that are true to the 70's, but are timely today.  The likes of Mick Jones and Russ Ballard wrote for it, and Nighy and Nail bring their own talents to the fore.  It's one of the few movies that I own and will never tire of watching.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|A tremendous achievement, largely due to the performance of George C. Scott. Considering when this film was made (1970), it could have easily been a heavy handed indictment of things that harmed flowers and other living things. Instead we get a brilliant and innovative character study of a complicated warrior who believed in re-incarnation and the ultimate power of war and violence. Patton was a man who read his bible religiously (no pun intended) yet gloried in using the enemy's living guts to grease the wheels of his tanks. This is definitely a 'warts and all\\" bio-pic. The Director, Franklin Schaffner, had a knack for making serious, no-frills movies (Pappillon, Boys from Brazil) with no superfluous romance or comic relief, and he was well chosen to take on this subject. This is a lean, mean film with no filler. Take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the opening scene. Make sure your standing at attention.

068981528X|5.0|When my daughter first brought this book home from kindergarten I tried to read it to her.  I couldn't!  I was laughing so hard that I couldn't make it through.  I evently did, and my daughter loved it.  She then took it to have her grandmother read it to her, the same thing happened.  <br />Even today, as an 11 year old, my daughter loves this book.  It is one of the few \\"children's\\" books that still remain on her bookshelf.  <br />Is there a moral?  Does there have to be?  It is a funny, lighthearted story, that gives kids the opportunity to explore creativity by changing things as they know it.  <br />I have shared this book with several of my daughter's classes, and each time I have, I have been told that there have been several more orders for this book.<br />Is it a classic?  Probably not.  It is entertaining?  Most definately.
0345410025|5.0|This is my story! I was pretty much a failure in school. i was a D student and only got the D's because the teachers felt pity on me. I'm in my third year of college and college has pretty much been a failure. So my plan was if I don't do good, i will join the military. Luckily, I was just surfing and found this book. I bought it and after skimming through the book to get a feel of what it's about, I've started to realize that this is probably going to be the best book I'd ever read and it was! <br />I couldn't believe that nobody in my family had discovered this! This book changed my whole study habit and my life. It changed the way I think. Sadly, just as it stated in the book, people are just not interested in the idea of memeory improvement. I don't blame them because I was the same. People tend to believe that a good memory is inborn. I'd refer this book to 2 of my good friends, but they were uninterested. SAD!<br />Anyways, I waited a whole semester before writing a review and now i am writing it. I got all B's in my classes and one A. I've never gotten such good grades and let me tell you, most people would tell you that i'm lazy, but at the same time, ask me how I did so well. I couldn't believe that I was doing better than the kids who I thought were so smart. I'd put less effort than them, but achieved better results. <br />I have not use the full potential of this book and i'm doing very well. Though this is a great book, I wouldn't suggest it be the only book you read. Read as many books as you can and put all the useful information together. <br />If only somebody had taught me these techniques when I was younger, but i'm not going to dwell on the past. I'm grateful to find such a wonderful book while i'm young. Some people will never learn about this and that's going to affect their next generations. One thought that came to my mind is that we humans been around for thousands of years, yet probably many people don't even know what the word &quot;mnemonic&quot; means. Many people never learn these techniques. Anybody who learn it is very fortunate! Very!<br />Buy the book! It's only about 10 bucks or so but the benefits are pricelss.
0684833395|4.0|The Book Catch 22 by Joseph Heller is novel about a young man named Yossarian who is a bomber in the war. He is a scared, weak drunk who hates being a bomber in the war. He is afraid of dying and does anything in his power to not have fly missions. He faked a liver problem and went to the hospital for a few weeks to just relax, hit on the nurses and talk to other patients. One time he even faked being someone else dying and talked to the guys family just so the doctor wouldnt tell that Yossarian wasnt actually sick. Heller portrays the whole unit Yossarian is in and everyone he meets to be sort of odd and a little crazy. Most the captains and people of rank are alcoholics and do something to take advantage of their positions in the military. For example Major de Coverly kidnaps Italian laborers and goes to cities to get apartments for officers and enlisted men to go on leaves. The main purpose of these leaves is to visit prostitutes and get drunk. I feel that Heller portrays everyone in the book to be a joke, and I think he shows his feelings about war through these characters.<BR> Catch 22 is a good book but a confusing one you need to pay attention to all the characters because they all seem to have a story to go along with them and in some way they connect to Yossarian. Heller furthers the complexity by jumping from character to character and from scene to scene. Catch 22 is a funny novel with a lot of good humor about life and the war.
0802130208|4.0|The Confederacy of the Dunces<BR>By Drew Young<br />The Confederacy of the Dunces is a book written by John Kennedy Toole.  This book is an enjoyable read, and it always keeps you on your toes.  The main character, Ignatius J. Reilly is a thirty-year-old man who lives with his mother in New Orleans.  He is well educated, but he just sits at home writing on big peaces of paper on what he thinks the world should look like.  He goes through a hard time when his mother forces him to get a job to pay off debt.  The events that follow are humorous and entertaining to any reader.<BR> The things that made this book interesting and good were, the unique characters, the characters personality, and the way the two plots were brought together in the end.  The main character Ignatius comes across as a person who thinks he is the smartest person in the world.  He is a large person with a unique personality and is often described as a whale with a mustache.  He has a green hunting cap with flaps and he puts the flaps up when he listens and puts them down when he talks.  His mother, who takes care of Ignatius, is a nice lady who has no friends.  As the book progress she finds love, and becomes more social.  Dealing with Ignatius's problems drove her to drink.  At a point she gets frustrated with her son, and asks him to get a job.  No job could fit Ignatius unique personality.  The other thing that makes the book interesting is the way they have two plots run at the same time and they make no sense until almost two thirds of the way through the book.  The author did a good job of making lose ends come together nicely at the end of the book.<BR> The thing I enjoyed most about is book is the way the author incorporated humor into the novel.  This is probably the first novel I have ever read where I have laughed out loud while reading.  However, Toole jumped into a plot with out warning.  In the first chapter the author introduced the characters and the plot, but he did it in a way that I hadn't expected.  This book was an enjoyable read, and the author's sense of humor was enjoyable.  I suggest you read this book.
B00005JLET|5.0|I'm not a &quot;ANIME&quot; person, and I thought all those animated movies were only for kids even when my best friend kept telling me how great Miyazaki's films are.  However, after watching this movie, I had to admit that this movie isn't just a cartoon movie for kids but this movie is a piece of art work.  It is a real masterpiece!!  I was totally amazed by the colors they used and it is such a great and beautiful world of imagination!! <BR>I bought all of his collection after watching this movie, and I'm 100% satisfied!!  If you love art, this movie is highly recommended.

B00005QFHG|5.0|I love chocolate.  It's sweet and sensual.  The movie details the effects of chocolate and what it does to the townspeople.  Vianne, part Latino and part French, moves northward to a village and opens a chocolate shop.  She welcomes the battered wife of a local, a elderly diabetic woman who's not afraid to exhibit herself, and a man who tries her chocolate and gets kinky with his wife.  She arouses people's suspicions and inhibitions with her creations but she also runs from one place to another not letting go of her mother's ashes.  Vianne falls in love with river rat Roux.  <BR>I loved this movie.  It was easy to indulge and relax in as themes of chocolate and passion echo into my mind.  Johnny Depp still looks good after &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;.
B00003OSTQ|5.0|Being born the year this movie was released, 1976, I had only recently heard about it and am sorry I didn't watch it sooner.<br /><br />Growing up in the 80s, my first introduction to television was what Paddy Chayefsky came up with as far-fetched in the mid-70's.  The current \\"reality TV\\" boom in recent years is on a par with the radicals that Faye Dunaway's character wanted to showcase to the country.<br /><br />And the way the network searches for something more outlandish than Howard Beal when his ratings begin to slide was prophetic: Today, the networks compete with each other on a daily basis to outdo the other in outlandishness and who can go completely over the top.<br /><br />A must have for your collection.
B000005RFJ|5.0|The dynamics, variation, musicianship, and continuity of this album are far above the curve.  Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) said this is his favorite album.  There's nothing by any other heavy band that can compete with this album.  The song &quot;Solitude&quot; is a slow sorrowful bluesy chant, &quot;Orchid&quot; is a beautiful instrumental with cellos, &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; is a head-banging metal masterpiece, &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; is a powerful jubilation-alleluiah chorus to our favorite green sweet leaf, and there's so much more on this album. My personal favorite is &quot;Into The Void&quot;.  A heavy, doomy piece in an odd-time signature that tells a story of mankind's exodus from a polluted earth, Soundgarden &quot;attempted&quot; to cover the song, but gave up!<BR> The arrangement and sequence of songs on the album is perfect!  Forget Tool, forget Limp Biskit, forget Stone Temple Pilots, forget Soundgarden, and forget Alice In Chains, Sabbath were truly the Original Masters of heavy rock-n-roll.  Cranium-expanding production for 1972!
6301967992|5.0|Jack Mac Gowran (Prof. Abronsius) and Polanski (Alfred) made a great team as a vampire hunting professor and his bumbling assistant, respectively.  Nothing they do makes sense, screwing everything up, and that's what makes the movie so great.<br /><br />There are unconventional aspects of this spoof, like the vampire's gay son that hits on Alfred, that makes the movie stand out from all the others.<br /><br />One of the greatest vampire movies of all time, spoof or not.
006092988X|5.0|I read this book when I had just turned 14.  Before that time, I was not an overly emotional person - didn't cry at movies, etc.  Let me tell you, if you wish to be involved in the characters you are reading about, to have a touching story stick with you through life or to just have a classic read that is very enjoyable, read this book.  Since I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I have better learned to stay in touch with my compassionate, nurturing and sensitive side.  I am 24 now and have been known to cry on subway rides because I am so involved in the novels I am reading.  This book will surely do that to you.
0375414932|5.0|This was the first book by William Boyd I read. Now I know what &quot;compulsive reading&quot; is. If you like travelling, meeting people, history or/and secretly want to be a writer yourself, read this book. I checked several footnotes appearing on nearly every page of the book and nearly all the given information was true. No wonder it took Mr Boyd 30 months to prepare for writing this book. I found this book very satisfying.
B000002UR7|5.0|A decade ago, the most ethereal, empyrean band burst onto the scene with a flourishing rock record via Pablo Honey. Most average music fans probably own The Bends and O.K. Computer, leaving this seminal debut buried in the dust. This record should be exhumed from the bottom of every cd bin, record collection, and store shelf, and placed on the top. Nary a record in the 90s comes close to this one except for other Radiohead efforts. Thom Yorke penned down some stunning lyrics and the whole band fused those words into swirling rock and roll symphonies, bewitching all audiances. From the opening words of You to the closing crunches of the clean version of Creep, the listener of this brilliant work can do nothing but turn the volume up. I'm not going to claim that this cd needs to be in your cd collection, or that you're any less of a person if you don't own this, but I exhort anyone who never listened to this recording to give it a try. It may prove to be as captivating and revolutionary for you as it was for me.
B0000039PW|5.0|I was never a die-hard Biggie fan.  I liked his material for the most part, but there were holes in his career through and through. <br />However, I can't exactly say that about the Ready To Die LP.  Every track is flawless, minus Friend of Mine.  Other than that, you couldn't tell me this album is anything less than classic of classics.  A true hip-hop wonder.  Lyrically, very few can match the poet Biggie was here.  Some of the darkest beats can be found here also.  One of hip-hop's best combinations of beats and rhymes together.  You look at an album like Delton 3030, and you have a perfect instrumental album, but mediocre lyrics.  You look at Chino XL's Here to Save You All, and you have the opposite.  With Biggie's Ready To Die, you get BOTH.  Very few albums can claim that level of greatness.<br />This album is what gave Biggie street credibility, and it really didn't seem how \\"commercial\\" he became, true hip-hop masses still gave this guy major respect and praise, and Biggie could have given all the credit to this album, not Life After Death, which is sub par at best in comparison.
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22 is a book about a great American bomb squadron during World War II.  The book is about what it is like to be an American pilot in another country during the war.  Yossarian, who is the main character of the book, is basically a very crazy person just because of all the experiences he has had with war.  He has seen so many of his friend die that he does not want to fly on any other missions because he thinks that he will die.  He is very nervous as to what will happen in the future, so he basically goes into the hospital so he does not have to go on any other missions.  One of the main problems is that the number of required missions keeps getting raised, which means for him that he will be stuck there until he gets them done, but he does not want to go on another mission and refuses.  <BR> During the book, Yossarian comes up with many plans to help him get out of the war and to get back home.  All of the plans that he makes up, always get destroyed because of catch 22.  Catch 22 is a kind of statement or rule that the men in the war have come up with for certain circumstances they are put under.  Every time he tries to get out of the war, there is always someone or something that is stopping him, and that is the catch.  Eventually toward the end of the book, some of the higher ranked men ask him to fly the less dangerous missions, and they will have other men fly the dangerous ones in his place.  He still disagrees with this because he does not want the men to be put in a spot where they see the same that he has seen.  This is Yossarians main problem in the book.  He wants to save all of the men in the war from dying or from seeing the horrible sights of the war that he has seen.  This would mean that in order for Yossarian to save the men is for him to fly the dangerous missions.  Every time he flies the missions, he is getting more insane because he is putting himself in the places that the other men would die in.  This for him is self sacrifice, and thatis what is making him so insane throughout the book.<BR> During the book, Joseph Heller, the author, does a great job in explaining the circumstances and events that happen in war.  He does a very great job in describing all of the characters and how they all feel.  He also relates all of the feelings of the characters, to the real life feelings that people would have while in war.  The main theme of the story is that Yossarian has to sacrifice himself in order to save the other men in the war.  This is the problem, because it makes him more insane throughout the book, but in order for him to save the men, he is forced to choose one of the two things that are put in front of him, and that is the catch.  Throughout the book overall, Yossarian has himself caught between two things that are both bad for him.  So overall, the theme of this book gives a good idea as to what can happen to a man that is put in the horrible consequences of war.  I think that the overall book is very well written, because the author can make the reader feel sad about the war one minute, and happy about it the next, and that is what is so great about the book.
B000084T18|3.0|Not Going Anywhere.<br />I was a die-hard 50 Cent fan wayyy before this guy even scratched the surface of the hip-hop music industry, and I have to say, this album wasn't as great as I expected.  Don't get me wrong, a gem here and there can be found on Get Rich Or Die Tryin', but this isn't classic by any means.<br />The way I see it, half the album is hot, half filler material, but even on the filler material, 50 presents one of the hottest flows this industry has experienced in years it seems.  That's what makes this guy so special when he's on the mic.  Sure this guy isn't a Canibus, or Chino XL, but who in today's game has a higher level of mic presence?  <br />All in all, 50 Cent could have pushed out a better album, and I doubt his next album will be any better, but this album is worth the money you pay for it.
B0000035E7|4.0|This is Nirvana at their 1st phase in their career. This album wreaks of Sex Pistols mixed with Pixies and even some Beatles. This album came out under the indie label sub-pop records and to this day is a testament of the undeniable genius that Nirvana was. Their isnt any flashy, show-offy guitar solo stuff in here. Just a bunch of guys who are extremely passionate about music and are sick and tired of what music has become. This album came out in 89, a time when mainstream music was just spinning lovey-dovey tripe from bands who dressed up as women. Sadly the masses ate it up. Nirvana was the complete antithesis of that scene. They were a punk band who played genuine music, they were raw, loud, and angst filled. Kurt Cobain idolized Jimi Hendrix and it's evident because he used alot of feedback and distortion in his playing. All in all this is a great debut from a band that was going to change music because it just had to be changed, end of story.
B000002KBU|5.0|First time I heard the album I hated it. I liked her lyrics but her voice was terrible. I gave it few listens and then I stopped listening and put the cd on the shelf. Few months later I decided to give this album another chance. And guess what I really liked it. Her voice my be sometimes irritating to those who are buying perhaps a Joni Mitchell album for the first time just like I did with this one but then I got used to it and although her voice is not amazing it certainly works. Jonis voice has never been talked about or hailed for that matter it is that her words are so honest and beautiful. She is very vulnerable and perhaps sometimes corny but no to corny or not to vulnerable. Blue is mostly about love or somethings that have happened in her life and she does it perfectly. Musically the instruments are mostly just guitars and pianos. It does not have any grand arrangements or anything and is in a way very simple but it has beautiful melodies and brilliant hooks to the entire album. Overall Joni has created a masterpiece with this album that certainly deserves it praise it has gotten.
B000002P5W|5.0|It has the song &quot;Little Wing&quot;, nothing else needs to be said.
6305603847|4.0|This movie has stunning images and a dark interior and i'm sorry, but i'm actually not much of a Pink Floyd fan. Although i have noticed that if you watch this movie on mute with Marilyn Manson's epic &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot; it goes along perfect with the plot of the movie! It's so awesome, especially if your more of a Manson fan than a Floyd fan. : )
B00005JLSE|5.0|.... This movie not only takes me back to the great musicals (Brigadoon, Singing in the Rain, The King and I, South Pacific) but does something I never would have expected. Instead of the movie featuring talking first with music to back it up, it's the MUSIC FIRST, with talking to back it up. The story is told through the music. This movie was bigger then life, glitzy, creative and everything a truly good musical should be. As far as I'm concerned, it's the best movie/musical to come out in a long, long time.
0684800713|4.0|This is the first time that I read this book, and I really enjoyed it (though I think that A FAREWELL TO ARMS is my favorite of the two). I loved reading it aloud for the humor in the dialog that becomes apparent more when spoken, and I've known people who were so inspired by this novel that they've gone all the way to Pamplona to see the Running of the Bulls for themselves.<br />There are some themes that emerged throughout and became part of the hum of the book, loneliness of the lifestyle, even though it sounds quite nice at first blush -- living without obligations turns to living aimlessly; stopping into a pub for a drink all the time, turns to a soggy, fogged existence affected by too much alcohol and drunkeness; traveling as you please turns to physical aimlessness and a desire to have someone to go to; and being so free turns to being lonely (even the traveler that Jake and Bill meet in the fishing town in Spain seems almost unbearably lonely).<br />Hemingway's prose is engrossing and seems to kind of motor you forward, forward, forward. Again, as I was with FAREWELL, I was blown away by the contradiction of the kind of journalistic, unemotional writing and the high level of emotions reading Hemingway produces due to the intimacy that the style makes one feel with the protagonist. I really enjoyed it again here.<br />However, I wonder if there isn't something about this novel that appeals more to men, generally speaking. I liked it, but I wasn't as moved by it as the other novel of his that I've read. I don't know that I'd go all the way to Spain based on this work alone. Perhaps its the theme of the insecurity of the men, their vulnerability to Brett that resonates with men. I just didn't like Brett too much (and thought Hemingway didn't either).
B000088E6D|5.0|Surprising debut. So clean, crisp and smooth. I loved 'For once in my Life' and Come fly with me. Moondance will always remind me of Van, but Buble' has convinced me that he is what great artists are all about - they rise to the challenge. <BR>Brilliant debut.
0345347951|5.0|Some critisize Childhoods End because it is merely a Sci Fi story, a book of ideas.  Despite what others say, I believe Childhoods End deserves the title of a classic.  It contains some of the most intriguing and mind bending ideas I have ever experienced.  These ideas are not only explained, but they are delivered in a fashion that forces the reader to examine them.  An excellent work in my mind, give it a try.
B0000025D0|5.0|This album contains my favorite Springsteen songs, yet it's not my favorite of his albums.  \\"Badlands\\", \\"Racing in the Street\\", \\"Promised Land\\", the title song, \\"Prove It All Night\\", \\"Factory\\"- absolutely the the best songwriting Springsteen has ever done, yet all of these songs receive their best performances in concert.  Unfortunately, I don't care for the production or the performances on this album.  Bruce sounds like he's singing from the back of his throat to deepen his voice- \\"Born To Run\\" suffered from that a bit too, bit not as bad as on this one.  Even the E Street Band sounds a bit sluggish- the tempo on most of these songs is just a bit too slow.  And Bruce badly needs to remaster his entire CD catalog- the sound on this album is partciularly lackluster.<br />That being said, this is essential Springsteen and belongs in any collection.  Bruce is angry, heartbroken, frightened and above all, optimistic.  Everything that he represents is on this album- celebration of the common person, acknowledgment of how modern society wears us down, the ambiguity that thwarts us when trying to make choices, the value of work and labor and how we define ourselves with such things, the compromises we make in our dreams and ideals in order to survive, the complexity and frequent disappointment of relationships, the never-obtainable romanticized ideal of love, and of course, the idea that at the end of every hard earned day \\"it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive\\".  This album isn't depressing.  What it is is life affirming- we all experience the hardships and disappointments of life, but in the end we go on because what life offers far outweighs the daily grind that threatens to drag us down.  It does wonders for the soul to hear someone put these thigns into words.  Bruce understands and captures in his lyrics all aspects of the human condition.  You won't find a better example of that than in the songs on this album.<br />As I said, this is essential Springsteen, despite my complaints about the production values.  Still, better examples of most of these songs are found on his two live albums with the E Street Band.  Listen to \\"Racing in the Street\\" on Live 75-85 and prepare to be heartbroken by the absolute pain and beauty in Bruce's signing and in the mournful piano that opens and closes it.  To me, there is no finer musical moment than that rendition of this haunting song.
B00000JCOV|1.0|Good if you are morose and wish to commit suicide sometime soon...
0140288503|4.0|This book came out well before the movie version did, and it is a lot less antiseptic in its reporting as well.  For example, when a 5 year old kid is shot by an American soldier that thought he was the enemy.  This was nowhere in the movie.  A lot more graphic detail about this sad situation is included, where a well-meaning mission went awry and fatally wrong.  It is sad those American soldiers lost their lives as well as the many innocent civilians caught in the crossfire.  Great for understanding the problem with peacekeeping and missions in such poor countries.  Sadly, George W. Bush found out about Clinton not allowing the use of C130 planes instead of just Black Hawks from the movie version, and not an adviser or better yet the book.  Good pace in the book, great writing and lots of information as well.
0517122707|3.0|The book, A Confederacy of Dunces, which was written by John Kennedy Toole, was far from intriguing.  From the first sentence you could tell that it was not going to be an entertaining book.  The lack of interest of the book came from the lack of personality of his characters.  Toole's writing is descriptive but not enjoyable to the reader.  He does not keep the reader wanting to come back to the book each night.<BR> Ignatius, who was the main character, was a 30 year old man who still lives with his widowed mother.  He is a very lazy nonsocial man who thinks that the world is out to get him.  He hardly ever has a job, and when he does it is either as a hot dog vender or at a pant maker, which neither of them pay much money.  Since he graduated from college and he received his Masters degree, you would think that he would have done something with his life.  Ignatius' mother, Mrs. Reilly, who is an out of work widow, spoils her son to no end.  Deep down she hates how her son is so lazy and thinks that he is very annoying.  She worries that he will never find anyone to marry.  Ignatius hardly ever comes out of his room and when he does it is to go some where with his mother and that is finally starting to bug Mrs. Reilly.  She never gets any time alone to hang out with friends until she meets Santa, officer Mancuso's aunt. <BR> Even though Toole puts every aspect of an American society in his book, he still is missing something to grab the attention of the reader.  I would not recommend reading this book.  I think this is just a waste of time and you don't get anything out of the book.  There is no enjoyment.
B000006YO2|5.0|Roxy Music was very innovative for their time and their sound progressed with every album. In particular, they used the synthesizer in a new way to create compelling textures in their fresh take on art rock. Much variety is displayed here in great rockers like Street Life and the frenzied pop of their first major hit Virginia Plain. There is also the majestic buzz of Love Is The Drug and the slick croon of Dance Away and More Than This, another take on plastic soul? Avalon impresses with its mature lyricism while their interpretation of the classic Smoke Gets In Your Eyes has stood the test of time very well. But my favourite is Ferry's bizarre version of Bob Dylan's A Hard Rain's Gonna Fall, a truly amazing tour de force of hypnotic beats and weird vocals giving the song a complete make-over. This is a truly outstanding collection of songs and though it may not please all the hardcore fans, it provides the cream of Roxy and Ferry's hit singles, making it the perfect anthology for exploring the man and the band.
B000069HKH|2.0|Like all Springsteen fans I was so excited that he was releasing a new album I pre-ordered the cd so I could have it as soon as it came out. Leading to my anticipation was his excellent tour he did with the reunited E Street band and some of the new material he did for those show. After having listend to this cd for over a year and catching him on tour last year I have to say<br />it's not that good. the stand out song is your missing, The rising, and into the fire. The rest ahhh. This record makes me think of Human touch. It sounds good the first couple of times you play it but you get bored with it quickly. The writing is just not that good. He continualy uses the same metaphors.<br />And some of the songs (worlds apart are darn right embarrising).<br />I know he can do much better then this.
B00008D1NF|5.0|As an American living in Sao Paulo, Brazil for the past 6 years, I have had a bit of experience finding the select grains of wheat among the vast chaff of current Brazilian music.  Capital Inicials Accoustic Set, Titas accoustic, some Rappa, Gabriel O Pensador etc.  This Tribablistas CD is an interesting CD, in that it combines a Paulista (Antunes) with a Carioca (Monte) with a Baiano (Brown) to come up with a really special thirteen tracks.  My favorites are \\"Carnavalia\\", \\"Vehla Infancia\\", \\"Passe em Casa\\" and even the slightly poppy \\"Ja Sei Namorar\\".  Antunes voice will take a bit of getting used to for most, and it's a pity a lot of provincial Americans miss out on a lot of good Brazilian music cause they \\"can't understand the lyrics\\".  Don't worry about it! Slip it in the player and relax to the gentle beat of this CD, you won't be upset.  Too bad CD's are so expensive in the States, I paid the equivalent of US$6.00 here in Brazil....
B00008NG5V|5.0|JJ's new cd On and On has a lot of good songs. But his other songs such as &quot;Posters&quot; and &quot;Flake&quot; are also good but they dont compare to these songs. JJ doesnt have the mellow type like most singers like him. Ben Harper and JJ have opened up the music industry for their type of genre. JJ really hit the spot with this cd.
B0000507QH|4.0|A middle-aged philosophy teacher is having sex with a horde(whom later also have 'relationship' with another two men) where he could get give up the woman as he is too obsessed by her. This movie will be recommened to those whom like multiple sex scene and the rating I give to the scene are 4 star. The story of this movie is only a three star rating. The story end up with an accident where the philosophy teacher almost had himself killed.
0393057658|5.0|Michael Lewis has done us a great service: he has unleashed upon an unsuspecting public the story of Billy Beane and the Oakland A's. It's a story that legitimizes performance analysis, debunks the myth that baseball is to be seen but not studied, and of course, entertains, by way of some rather unlikely characters (Scott Hatteberg, Chad Bradford). For those of us that have been waiting for the Oakland-led assault on baseball tradition to become a full-fledged revolution, this book is an important step: every baseball fan who reads it and comes away discouraged by their own team's relative lack of sophistication, and we're another small step closer to that revolution.
0920668372|2.0|This book wasn't for me. . .depressed me actually.  At the start of my child's life, I couldn't deal with a book that was about me growing old and leaving him behind.  I know that not the book's point and perhaps I'll wake up in a another year and love it but for now I've put it away and don't plan to pick it up again anytime soon.
0375414053|1.0|I'm a lawyer and a mom, and while I sometimes related to Kate's frustration with time and with her kids, I found the book incredibily depressing.  I was literally SAD much of the time I spent reading this supposedly \\"hysterical\\" book - and angered by the fact that the reviewers were calling it the \\"most honest book about modern motherhood\\" - this is not a true book about modern motherhood - if it were we would all slit our own wrists.  I agree with the reviewer that called this a backlash against working mothers - it really seems to imply that a working mom cannot possibly be happy.  Don't waste your precious time or money on this one.
B000000W3G|5.0|this is definitely only worth the money if you LOOOVE the pumpkins, however, it is the best box set i could have ever asked for.  as well as containing the only pumpkins single ever to be discontinued, it has tons of awesome b-sides and jams that are unbeatable in quality.  i love the one on the zero single especially.  my favorite disc from this box set has got to be bullet with butterfly wings.  the seven track version is hard to come by these days because it was discontinued, but it is so good.  it has a lot of covers on it, from the cars to alice cooper to blondie.  overall, this box set is a must for any avid pumpkins fan because it is absolutely AWESOME.  however, if you're just getting into the pumpkins, go buy mellon collie.  all the singles are off that album.
B000002UAX|5.0|When everybody says that this is just a rough album of all the Beatles dodgy works; like a pile of mess they've just created then thrown into the corner and then made it into an album, they're completely right... I haven't seen such a messy album in all my life.     But although it's messy as hell, it's genius lies in it's amazing diversity.  There's country music, rock, heavy metal, folk music from the 40s, ballads, lullabies, etc. When someone say's some songs are below average, that has no meaning within the context of the White Album. Needless to say, my opinions on what songs are better than others is worthless, because when you have such a diverse collection of songs, inevitably, the twelve songs you like the most are going to be completely different from the 12 songs your brother/sister/friend/parent likes the most. When people say the White Album is full of filler, they don't take into account the amazing diversity of the album.  All the songs here are solid and have meaning, but it all depends on what particular song gerne carters to your preferences whether you like it or not.
031286504X|2.0|I'm not kidding, I truly think these people are crazy.  I've just seen review after review describing how scary and suspenseful this book is.  What a joke!  It reads like a documentary that doesn't really go anywhere.  I thought the book was very interesting.  And if you want to someday write a horror book, maybe this book can give you some ideas.  But it's not suspenseful and, now don't all start screaming at once, it's kinda boring.  Sorry.  But you start it, you read it, and it's over.  No real ups or downs.  And the ending:  I guess it was supposed to be a big deal, but all I could think was, &quot;Who cares?&quot;
B0000029DD|5.0|Grace is a seriously beautiful album. From the opening Mojo Pin, a mystical, flowing song, into the jamming Grace, from the gorgeous Last Goodbye into the sultry Lilac Wine.. from the classic-rockin' So Real into the sensual and heady Hallelujah, from the what if posing of Lover You Should've Come Over into the choirboy Corpus Christi Carol, from the edgy and posturing Eternal Life into the haunting Dream Brother, this album is a fabulous railroad trip straight into a beautiful state of grace, of music, that enchants, provokes and inspires.. one to get & hang onto, through the sun & rain.. though i must say it does seem to be a 'listen at night' selection.. very intriguing.. get it & never look back...
B00005JLWN|5.0|I think most everyone who saw Equilibrium would agree it was the most pleasant surprise of 2002.  It's first-rate entertainment that pretty much had it all: a solid story, a stellar cast, visually appealing sets, and the most wildly thrilling action sequences of its kind since The Matrix.  <br />Thus, it is inevitable, especially considering the movie was financed by Dimension Films, the purveyor of realising schlock straight-to-video releases, that a direct-to-video sequel will be proposed to cash in on this movie's burgeoning fan base.  As a huge fan of Equilibrium, I cannot emphasize what a terrible idea that would be.  This is a movie that clearly concluded its story and left just enough for viewers to chew on their own time.  Don't disgrace this film with unnecessary sequels.
B000002UAO|5.0|The review already categorizes this CD as one of the initial attempts by the Beatles as they began to acquire fans for their soulful sounds, and thoughtful lyrics. This is one of the best in that it reflects upon the too often reality that far too many a person has a \\"rubber soul,\\" which I interpret as wavering beliefs, usually followed by wavering loyalties. The shallow comforts of the trivial pursuits that work mostly to magnify themselves among the masses in the spirit of self adulation. Until the Beatles arrived in America, their best work was always in introspection and expanding the nexus between the human heart and brain, that awakened two nations to the need for spiritual and practical connection. On this CD are a number of songs that gently reveal the gaps that most young people sense as they transition to being adults, and realize that what they'd been taught is not necessarily what they see, the emergence of noticing the hypocrisy among us. Classics that evoke the sorrow of reaching a state where the fork proves to be significant as well as challenging. Never out of style, and mostly distorted even by some of their greatest hits which may have contributed to their dissension among the group in being unable to maintain a style that had far more depth and meaning than many more recent songs. The delicacy of Norwegian Wood, the far reaching impressionism in Nowhere Man spoke of men mired in a world of demands they were helpless to conquer without resorting to becoming the faceless, convictionless clones of others seen - suits in motion - without the freedom to express their hearts and souls, comfortable only through the lyrics of diffusion in a world that wanted no more than the slow spin of misery to keep it moving. These are the sounds upon which their foundation was built and which they continued to adhere, when they could, when we would let them. When they couldn't, John moved on....and the rest is history. While change may be good, soul altering changemay not be depending upon the direction.
B00008QSA5|5.0|the openning of &quot;Albert's Shuffle&quot; is one of the best intro or might be the best intro of a blues song by an amplified guitar i've ever heard then when i was still a kid; and it still is after all these years. that song alone epitomizes the so called Bloomfield way of playing the blues.<BR> a great big thanks to all that worked hard to re-release this great must-have album
B000059PPX|1.0|This has got to be the worst movie of it's type (big budget, big stars) I have ever seen.  A complete [distruction] of Terry Southern's hilarious 60's novel, it captures not one of the laughs, not one of his comical characters and none of his satirical wit. The movie was deservedly savaged by critics and avoided by moviegoers.  The best excuse I can find for it is that it was made during a time of many studio restrictions. and could be a truly funny independent film today.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Quite possibly the best footage created of WWII re-enactments.  The documentary style openings lend a feeling of connection to the characters that you will find in no other movie, including \\"Saving Private Ryan\\".  Also the extra material that comes with the DVD's is extremely informative in a simple intuitive timeline menu.  Highly recommended for anyone interested in WWII history.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I live in Guatemala, Central America and yesterday I found out that the Latin American version of this Special Edition of Sleeping Beauty was already for sale.  I bought mine and let me tell you that the movie never looked better, brilliant colors, wonderful Dolby Digital 5.1 sound and it has a lot of really cool features.  Based on what I've seen in my copy of this classic, I recommend that you buy the American edition, you won't be disappointed.  The Latin American has only one diference with the one for sale in the U.S.  It doesn't have the Full Screen version of the movie (I won't miss that). Reserve your copy of this wonderful movie today!
B00005R2M3|3.0|The first Shakira I heard was &quot;Donde est&aacute;n los ladrones?&quot; (&quot;Where are the Thieves?&quot;).  And after that incredible, moving album, the only thing I can really say about this album is that the cover says it all: Shakira bleached her music along with her hair, removing the telltale stains of her originality.  The Spanish/Turkish(?) version of &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; (&quot;Ojos as&iacute;&quot;) is hands down much better than the weak English lyrics.  And only one of the songs (&quot;Que Me Quedes Tu&quot;, I believe) comes anything close to the emotional power of nearly every single track on &quot;Donde est&aacute;n los ladrones?&quot;<br />It's not a bad CD, and for someone with little or no exposure to latin pop, or if you need no-brainer music (I know I do, sometimes), I might recommend it, but if you're after music that moves you, and music that is a little thicker with humanity and emotion, then I'd have to tell you to look for the thieves, instead.
B000089CJI|3.0|<br />Dntel's Jimmy Tamborello and Death Cab For Cutie's Ben Gibbard knew they were on to something good as soon as they finished collaborating on the track \\"(This is) the Dream of Evan and Chan.\\" That compelling combination of Tamborello's melodic knob-twiddling and Gibbard's literate vocals and forlorn delivery was the triumph of Dntel's acclaimed 2001 release Life Is Full of Possibilities. Not long after that first collaboration, The Postal Service was born. The relative strangers began recording in December 2001, swapping tracks on CD-Rs through the mail. <br />Listening to the act's debut brings back the same sort of giddiness inspired in me by New Order's Low Life when I first picked it up a decade-and-a-half ago. The Postal Service expertly channels that adolescent spirit with an awkward blend of dance beats and melodic songwriting. However, the duo has updated the sound for the millennial set, pleasantly mixing Depeche Mode beats and bass lines, Pet Shop Boys melodies and Warp Records-styled twinkling tones and clicks. Orchestral samples and pseudo horns add an unusual flavor to \\"Clark Gable.\\" Chunky, monophonic Casio-sounding keys tie the vocals to the beat in \\"Nothing Better.\\" <br />Two of the album's highlights appear right at the front end of the record. The first song, \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight,\\" leads with brooding organ, before beats saunter in and steadily cruise through the first verse and chorus to a clean, ringing guitar riff. A second chorus pumps even harder and defies you to not sing along. This despite a characteristically bumming realization repeated by Gibbard: \\"I am finally seeing why I was the one worth leaving\\" (Christ, Benny, just stick a fork through my heart, why don't you?). Track two, \\"Such Great Heights,\\" has already been released as a single. The catchy number apes Rod Stewart's \\"Young Turks,\\" especially the beat and understated arrangement, albeit in an electro fashion. <br />The remainder of Give Up is solid, though Gibbard's lyrics are less potent by the middle of the record, and Tamborello burrows perhaps a little too deeply into some of the thinner sounds of the cold '80s era that inspires him. \\"Sleeping In\\" stumbles a bit with Gibbard's trite invocation of the JFK assassination, but the murmured chorus, \\"Don't wake me, I plan on sleeping in,\\" that drapes over a quiet acoustic guitar phrase is strong enough to carry the entire song. <br /> Perhaps the only shortcoming of Give Up is that the adherence to pop shuts out some of the more interesting electronic elements explored on Life Is Full of Possibilities. \\"Natural Anthem\\" is probably the most adventurous Postal Service tune, utilizing a relatively heavy break-beat, a looping string sample and more aggressive production, but clearly the duo's strengths are geared more toward hit-making than trailblazing. So, while the record isn't necessarily an instant classic, the unabashed embrace of simple pop sensibilities, both old and new, make it a record that is hard to stop listening to.
B00005JLSC|3.0|Its just a musical folks. I personally liked \\"Moulin Rouge\\" much better. There's just too much hype going on this movie, but I will admit that it was fun seeing Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renne Zellweger and Richard Gere in a musical. Is it the greatest movie ever made? No. <br />There's just too much hype on this movie, and its not the greatest movie that I've ever seen. Oh well, to each his or her own.

0140177396|4.0|John Steinbeck delivers a powerful and gripping story in his book, Of Mice and Men.  <br />It tells a tale of two friends on a journey to find joy in the California horizon.  George and Lennie are the pair that departs together to find work that would bring them closer to the dream of owning a farm.  The dream becomes harder for George because of the continuous hassle from Lennie, a mentally disabled man.  Yet the two travel together because of the loneliness of being alone and the company they bring each other.  Together they find work in Salinas Valley.  The dream of owning a farm comes closer until Lennie causes more conflict at their work.  But this time George puts the decision in his own hands.<BR>Steinbeck explores the nature of man and friendship in his book.  George's decision to end the cycle at the end of the book shows his character of understanding the situation that he was in.  George understood that together their dream was unachievable.  The constant struggle between George and Lennie did not help achieve their dream and put it into reality.  Many times before, George put up with this conflict because of their bond and friendship together.  Steinbeck shows that where there is a conflict the knowledgeable one should solve it.  In of Mice and Men, George realizes Lennie probably could never truly be happy.  So as a friend George tries to make Lennie's last memory of getting, \\"to tend the rabbits,\\"(105\\") in a farm with him.  Steinbeck provides some insight to what a good friend is and what man needs to do for survival.<BR>Steinbeck provides superb storytelling.  From beginning to end the novel makes you stick with their journey though their happiness and hardships.  He shows the connection of a powerful friendship and the limits they take to make each other happy.  Recommend this book to anyone looking to travel on a journey that will not let you go until the end. John Steinbeck delivers the goods with this one.

0380820846|4.0|Can you imagine secretively being able to give an account of some of the ridiculous happenings at socials to be published without others knowing you wrote them? It could be fun unless you are at the other end of the receiving line. This is a sweet romance about Peneloupe Featherington, the \\"wallflower\\" of the ton, who has had feelings for Collin Bridgerton since she was young. But she has gone unnoticed and accepts the fact of spinsterhood. Colin Bridgerton, member of the well-liked and wealthy Bridgerton family, started traveling when his mother put the squeeze on him to marry. Now after 10 years being abroad, he returns home for a visit only to discover that things have changed and that what he has been searching for was at home all along. LOVE! And all along \\"Lady Whistledown\\" is writing/publishing accounts of the Ton Events that are not always favorable. But just who is the mysterious Lady W? I also enjoyed Peneloupe and Eloise's friendship. This is a sweet romance, full of humor and lots of dialog that gets monotonous at times. Things seem to drag and don't really get going until half-way through the book.
B00005JLRT|1.0|Once again this film (as does the DVD itself) has to be all about Brent Spiner.<br />Oh how I loathe his hammy acting and he just ruins this film. He co-wrote the script which pretty much gave him free reign to shut out other characters (Crusher, Riker, Geordi, even Worf!) while he, himself, got to play 2 roles! Data and B4! UNBELIEVABLE!<br />I purchased the DVD earlier today and was shocked to find that the entire packaging is centered around...you guessed it, Brent!<br />He appears on the front, the back, the side sleeve, the paper insert and even the disc! It would have been nice to have seen Picard alone, bit no..every picture of him either has Brent beside him or looking over his shoulder.<br />This last film by the TNG cast tanked at the box office. Maybe most fans, like myself, just got sick of the filsm always being about Data. Nothing kills a fun time better than an ego.<br />To save this film from a completly abysmal rating, I do give a major plus to Tom Hardy as Shinzon. That boy is talented &amp; I would much rather have preferred screen time going to his character development rather than watching the horribly untalented Brent Spiner sing at Troi's wedding.
B00005YW4H|4.0|The first time I heard her voice, I could not believe she was so young - so many influences, so much confidence.  I can't fault her on singing the way SHE wants to.  However, after a few songs, I want to hear something bigger - it can get a little boring, but still this gal is quite special and sultry.  For those of you who need more &quot;umph&quot;, try MARY FAHL's new release, The Other Side of Time.  Fahl has tremendous pipes, interesting songs and lots of soul.  Very dramatic tunes for sophisticated musical ears.  Fahl could easily be the next big thing.
B000002B7W|5.0|First off this is a great CD.  Anybody who loves great guitar playing, especially great LIVE guitar playing, will love this album.  Randy Rhoads was a really great guitar player that had a big impact on 80's guitar playing and that whole shredder attitude.  The soloing on all the songs are exceptional, highlights including:Crazy Train, Mr.Crowley, and Suicide Solution with one of the most memorable unaccompanied guitar solos ever.  But after scanning the other reviews, I saw very little comments about Revelation Mother Earth.  This is one of the best songs on the album and the solo is damn great!  The only downer is the Dee outtakes which are just boring until he really gets to some playing.  But this is a great CD for some great Randy Rhoads, some great Ozzy vocals, and early 80's hard rock at its best.

Then I started to get the song stuck in my head so I looked up the rest of the album. It took me almost a year before I got it and I love love love it. A lot of people think that it's not that good and that they've gone off and will criticize people who don't own any of their other albums (me) but I think its awesome. And I'm gonna get the other albums ASAP.

B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie had been so hyped up on message boards that I was looking for the ultimate hidden gem with this movie.  While I'm not sure it quite stands up the brilliance that is has been described as being, this is a very fine movie.  The setting for Equilibrium is after World War III.  Having survived three world wars, humanity might not be able to survive a fourth.  It was decided that the greatest danger to humanity was humanity itself.  More specifically, it was human emotion that drove men to war.  To ensure that no war or murder would ever happen again, emotion was suppressed.  Every man, woman, and child had to daily take medication to suppress emotion.  There was no more murder (excepting the state sponsored kind), and feeling was a crime...called a sense crime.  A new agency was put into place to enforce the sense laws.  These men were known as clerics.<br />Christian Bale plays John Preston, the highest ranking cleric in the city/state.  It is his job to hunt down the sense offenders in the city.  We see Preston going about his job (violently at times) until he captures a sense offender named Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson).  Mary seems to remind Preston of his own wife (a sense offender, herself) and it is at this point when we see John Preston take an interest in feeling, and in the forbidden objects (music, most vestiges of the past).  You can guess where the movie goes from there.  This could be an excellent novel is the story was fleshed out a little bit.<br />The main aspect of this film that will draw in viewers is the action.  It is intense and at times unbelievable.  But, during the course of the story, we are told how such a thing is possible...and this helps more than one might think.  Not only do we believe that John Preston can pull off this action, we believe that with the proper training we also are capable of the same.  The gun battles are almost a dance, they are that well done, and I don't know how to describe some of the fight sequences.  In particular, there is a gun battle where the guns are almost used as swords where one mistake can end the battle....simply beautiful.<br />It seems that every science fiction movie will bear comparisons to The Matrix.  This is entirely unfair and absurd.  This movie is different than the Matrix, not necessarily better or worse.  It has its own style and is an excellent movie in its own right.articular, there is a gun battle where the guns are almost used as swords where one mistake can end the battle....simply beautiful.  <br />It seems that every science fiction movie will bear comparisons to The Matrix.

Some people might not like it, but afterwards I garauntee that the genious brittish mind will have effected them They will be haunted by the beauty that they have heard, and will want to here it again even if they don't admit it. <br />I haven't even got to the rest of the cd because every night I just crave to here the first few tracks as they are diferent, and completely mind boggling. When I first put it on, I thought: \\"Man, what kind of people did I listen to []?...To buy this!?\\"  Then, my thoughts quickly shut up, as this mesmorizing sound iluminated from my car stereo...My girlfriend stopped making fun of it as well....You must here this. If you buy anything Aphex Twin, I've heard you should start with this album, and I would not argue.<BR> .....Peace.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|Persuasion is by no means Jane Austen's most interesting book, but does it have to be so deadly dull?  Amanda Root does her best with what she's given to work with, but she generally comes across as a &quot;poor little match girl&quot; type with an annoying hang-dog expression.  We never get a glimpse of what could provoke Capt. Wentworth's passion.  Her sister Elizabeth is nothing more than a charicature, though the potrayal of her sister Mary is quite good.  The movie is too short to develop any of the secondary stories, so that certain plot lines and characters are just stuck into the main story and go nowhere.

Not liking this album is like saying you don't like cake/pie, or you didn't enjoy E.T. by Spielberg, alright? People that have put this album down have bad taste in my opinion.<br />Music is the one thing that brings us together, the one thing that makes everything O.K. in this life (besides family).

B000002UAF|4.0|Although firmly rooted in the time when rock music was never more complicated than teenage romance and a good twist-and-shout number, A Hard Day's Night is still a landmark for the Beatles and a great album after all this time.  That fact is even more impressive given that at the time the album format usually contained filler, because the best material ended up on singles.  Not the case for the Beatles, who had in just over a year's time released an album's worth of quality singles and two other decent LP's (although A Hard Day's Night is clearly the best.)<br />The songs were released to support the movie, and the first side of the album has all the cuts from the movie.  However this material was written before the movie, and is completely unrelated.  This was the first album the Beatles released that was full of only originals, and it reflects an early streak of peak creativity, particularly by Lennon- who wrote 10 of the 13 songs (Although McCartney's And I Love Her is a beautiful melody, and-in addition to being one of the high points on the album- demonstrated a considerable leap forward in his songwriting abilities.)  The Beatles were still firmly John's group at this point, and for the first time in their career there isn't any filler even if the songs are firmly separated into rock and ballad clichés.  A Hard Day's Night, If I Fell, You Can't Do That, and I'll Cry Instead measure up to anything he had written by this point, and the band as a whole had clearly grown more confident in their harmonizing and their instruments.  <br />In fact, the best word to describe this album is effortless.  It is tight, breezy, and best of all: it's really a lot of fun.  If you get the chance, it's definitely the best candidate of the early Beatles catalogue to revisit.
B00005JKHP|3.0|Because I became a Star Trek fan only gradually after the release of this movie, I have always had mixed feelings about Star Trek: The Motion Picture.<br />On the one hand, the return of Star Trek to any screen was indeed a big accomplishment, considering the genesis of this picture.  Indeed, the first hour of this movie is the strongest.  Kirk, who -- in the Star Trek timeline -- has spent the last 2 or so years as Chief of Starfleet Operations -- returns to command a refitted USS Enterprise to confront an unknown alien entitity which has already destroyed three Klingon cruisers.  The return of Kirk to the starship and the reunion of the Enterprise crew are the main draw to ST:TMP.<br />The second half of the movie is somewhat problematic.  While laudably wanting to avoid making Star Trek into a galactic shoot 'em up, the whole V'Ger (sometimes written as Vejur) plot line was essentially a combination of various Star Trek episodes (The Changeling, The Doomsday Machine, and others)) rolled up into one big, ponderous movie.  Not that the intentions were bad...they clearly were not, in fact. But the first Star Trek movie depended way too much on visuals at the expense of characterization.<br />Even so, the 2001 Director's Edition DVD is worth getting. The transfer from film to digital is clean and crisp, the sound is excellent, and some of the redone effects are simply amazing! Also helpful are the audio and text commentaries (which Lucasfilm would be advised to include in future Star Wars DVDs); they alone make this DVD worth buying.<br />All in all, not a bad first try for Star Trek feature films...although the next one, The Wrath of Khan, was far better.
B00003CXE7|5.0|How do people diss this movie? honestly, this is the best movie of all time for me. russel crowe is simply outstanding in this. The plot is clever, and Ridley Scott pulled it of astoundingly. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat almost the entire film. Please, buy this.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Red Hot Chilli Peppers are one of my favorite bands.  Actually, tonight at 7, I'm seeing them perform at Madison Square Garden, I can't wait.  Every song on this cd is really good.  If your a Chilli Peppers fanm you should buy it.
B000000OAH|4.0|In the 1970's, Queen were very diverse musically and they refused to be labelled. Despite the title \\"Jazz\\", this album from 1978 sure doesn't hold any jazz song, but there's plenty of different approaches. The opening and very odd \\"Mustapha\\" have the ability to shook the listener who might as well shout out: \\"What the hell is this?\\" On \\"Jazz\\" there's a couple of Queen's hardest rocking songs - \\"Let me entertain you\\" and \\"Dead on time\\", both rather close to heavy metal. There's also piano driven melodic rock in the shape of \\"Don't stop me now\\" - a very catchy tune. \\"Fat bottomed girls\\" and \\"Bicycle race\\" are both classic Queen numbers. But even if Queen usually obtain a very high standard regarding the material, a song like \\"Fun it\\" certainly sounds like a filler to me. \\"Jazz\\" might not be Queen's finest album but it's still a very solid rock effort from a time long gone by.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Ok, here's the deal. Opeth is by far the best band to come out for years and years. I absolutely love their music. The acoustic passages, drumming, heavy guitars and orchestration are breathtaking and beautiful. My only complaint is the death vocals. I know the whole \\"heavy vs. light concept\\". But this will still work without the grunts. I find it hard to believe they can write some of the most mature and diverse music and put the immature cookie monster vocals over it. I think Opeth will eventually lose the death vocals as they get older. I can't wait to hear them about ten years from now.
B000000OE7|2.0|When Queen recorded \\"Made in heaven\\", Freddie Mercury was literally dying, and he wanted to record as many songs as possible before he died. I believe sadness and nostalgic might blur the judgement regarding the value of this album, because it is not worth an average rating of 4.5 stars. That would be obvious when you compare \\"Made in heaven\\" with \\"Sheer heart attack\\" or \\"News of the world\\" just to name a few. Among the finer moments are the very good and emotional \\"Mother love\\" together with \\"Too much love will kill you\\" (originally a Brian May solo effort) but the overall impression is that time was running out and the band could not come up with enough good material so therefore, \\"Made in heaven\\" is an album of too many fillers or mediocre songs. Too bad, but that's the truth according to me!
B000060MY6|3.0|Ok, I have to admit that I did like the atmosphere of this movie and excitement I got from the first half of the movie, which made me want to figure out what is actually going on or has gone on. However, the movie failed to satisfy me after it started showing what actually happened (or did it?). But I was still not sure what actually happened. Even though I would think the director did not mean to show that to ME, I could not stop feeling left out by the director in the end.
B000002LEM|2.0|On a T-shirt I read \\"Give me Van Halen or give me head\\". If you give me \\"Van Halen I\\" and \\"Van Halen II\\", I might consider the options, but if it's about this album, I sure wouldn't hesitate going for the head thing. What happened? Van Halen started out as a great band but have gradually lost it. And bringing on Sammy Hagar sure didn't make things better. \\"OU812\\" is just mediocre at best. The opening track, \\"Mine all mine\\" is the albums' highlight.
B00003CXXM|2.0|Hum... I did not like the movie much. It was too all over the places (in other words, a little disturbing) and it was with too many unsatisfying changes of scenes for me. I felt like I was watching the sequence of bunch of action scenes. It is too bad since I like Matt Damon and Franka Potente and they are fine in the movie.
B000002GVO|2.0|5 stars? Get real. The debut from Eagles is worth highest rating but this album is far from that standard. Yes, there's the song \\"Hotel California\\" and I agree that it's one of Eagles' best ever, and probably one of the greatest songs regardless of artists/bands. Apart from \\"Victim of love\\" and \\"Hotel California\\", the material is quite weak and very uninteresting. \\"New kid in town\\" and \\"Life in the fast lane\\" are usually considered great among Eagles fans, but I believe they're both pretty [bad]. I suggest you get the three first albums because they display Eagles in their prime. I would give this album only 1 star if it wasn't for the song \\"Hotel California\\" (which is indeed a 5 star song).
B00005JLWN|5.0|As stated over and over this movie in terms of action is in a league all it's own.  The story most closely resembles Farenheit 451, a post war time where feeling has become a crime.  Christian Bale does a terrific job and you can really see his character at war w/ himself.  Excellent movie, great action.  See this movie.
B00005J9LY|5.0|Hardly the most innovative or best example of 80's dance music, synth pop or new wave, this is still one great album that still sounds great today.  Alot of 80's dance music has aged horribly, but this album has held up quite well.<br />This double CD version in particular is a must, because unless you have all the vinyl singles, you might be missing some of these remixes.  And it includes all of the b-sides from the &quot;Please&quot; era too, including the amazing &quot;That's My Impression&quot;, &quot;A Man Could Get Arrested&quot;, and &quot;Jack The Lad&quot;.  It carries a high price tag but the extended 'disco' version of &quot;Love Comes Quickly&quot; and &quot;...Impression&quot; are worth the price alone.  Some of the remixes are opulent or useless like the dance remix of &quot;West End Girls&quot; which strips the original of some of its melody and depth.  But overall, this is the essentail version of the essential 80's dance-pop masterpiece.
0316666343|4.0|This book was a wonderful &amp; interesting story told through the eyes of a young girl who was brutally murdered.  Her &quot;heaven&quot; and her past earth life are beautiful intertwined to make this both sad and uplifing at times.  <br />My only disappointment was not the ending itself, but as the book came to an end.  In one of the last chapters, it seemed the author took a page right out of &quot;Hollywood,&quot; (since I can't divulge any of the plot in my review, I can't divulge the movie, unfortunately!).  It clearly deviated from the originality of the story &amp; gave it a &quot;schlocky&quot; feel at this point.  <br />Normally, I read the books I love over and over.  This one will be donated to the public library.
B00005221L|5.0|Ahh, Predator.  This film really has no right to exist, let alone be as excellent as it is.  The plot, where an elite commando force on a &quot;rescue&quot; mission is set upon by a light-bending alien superpredator to their immense regret, is the stuff of C+ Dolph Lundgren fare, yet somehow it all comes together perfectly.  Good acting, great action, and downright claustrophobic suspense keep the plot buzzing right along.  This movie could be 90 minutes long, it could be 160..I really don't know, it's so easy to get swept up in it.  The special effects are as great today as they were when the film first came out, and are sharp and crisp on the DVD.  Who would have thought infrared vision would allow for such a range of effects?  From the first time we see the predator's huge paw as it picks up the cooling, almost stylized form of a dead scorpion, to the blood-red haze surrounding Arnold as the beast batters him into submission, our own world becomes as alien and terrifying as the creature inhabiting it.  The film starts as a buddy flick, turns into &quot;Commando&quot; and then segues neatly into &quot;Alien&quot; without any loss of purpose or momentum.  In addition to the innumerable classic one-liners you'll be repeating for the rest of the day (&quot;I ain't got time to bleed,&quot; &quot;Here we are again, bro..same kinda moon, same kinda jungle..,&quot; &quot;Ol' Painless is waitin'&quot;) each character has their due.  Mac (played by Bill Duke) does a wonderful turn as the mournful buddy of Jesse &quot;The Governor&quot; Ventura, madly murmuring to himself as he chases the Predator into the jungle the same lyrics to the rock music that so triumphantly accompanies them into the jungle in the first place.  Carl Weathers does a good job as a CIA man of mixed loyalties, and of course Arnold is perfectly cast as Dutch, the team leader.  This is a guy flick, let's not pretend otherwise, but it is not a dumb guy flick (either the guy, or the flick).  Check it out.
B00008I8IF|5.0|That's what Amazon.com says..I would like to say 'Well Said, Partner!'- This release is as enjoyable to listen as \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" from a decade ago (I'm getting old at 35) My favorite tracks are the title track (Lots of radio airplay on Sirius) and \\"TailSpin\\" (Not to be confused with \\"TaleSpin\\" My Disney Baloo/TS site). The bonus CD contains a great live take of \\"Waiting For The Sun\\". The Jayhawks ARE BACK and I can't wait to see them here in L.A. this summer. One of the best Alt-country & Folk-rock bands today. We are very lucky to have 'em back again!! Peace - JG ...
B00004BZ16|3.0|I remember getting this as an import, taking it home and being totally flustered.  It was such a sprawling work of material and styles, that it took me weeks to even form an opinion on it.  At the time I was a hardcore Clash fan who considered LONDON CALLING to be the greatest album ever made.  I could not decide whether this was yet another masterpiece or the [worst thing] that I ever invested in.  It ends up being somewhere in between, a little closer to the masterpiece side, though with a(n) (un)healthy amount of [stuff] strewn in.<br />A couple of items I think heavily influenced this record.  First is that the Clash were unhappy with their contract with Epic Records.  They had signed to do a number of album sides, and I believe that releasing a three record set of all the items in their vault would get them closer to being free agents.  Second, the Clash always paid heavy attention to the critics.  The big movement at the time had to do with \\"rockism\\", of which the Clash of LONDON CALLING were supposed to guilty of.  Thus, rather than continue on their Roots, Rock, Reggae direction, they decided to incorporate any influence that would not be deemed rockist.  So here we get ealy rap, faux jazz, dub, calypso, and what not.  That the results are generally pretty good is a fine comment on the talent and vision of the band.<br />With the advantage of time and hearing a lot of different music, I can say that this is neither a masterpiece or a failure.  It is instead a product of the times and of ambition that fell just a bit short of it's intended goal.  Some said that there was a great single Lp in the midst of this, but I would be willing to say that there would be a fine double LP.
B00005JLWN|4.0|i must admit, i was a little aprehesive about this movie at first, cause all the first half hour was (minus one really cool action scene) was a rip off of the Matrix, Farenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New World. had i been rating the originality of this movie, it would be a one. but i'm not, i'm rating whether or not it was fun. and it was. it has some very original action sequences. to me, that was what made the movie. the story was sub-par (bordering on annoying...) but i felt the action made up for it. some people can accept this, some people can't. thats fine. you will either love this movie, or hate it. i loved it. i thought the action was on level with that of the Matrix, and each fight scene was completely different than the rest. all in all worth at least watching, but i don't guarantee you'll like it. just don't expect too much out of the story...
B00005N919|5.0|What really can I say about this movie that has not already been said before.  It is sexy, gruesome, scary and one hell of a ride.<br />Sharon Stone gives the performance of a lifetime.  In fact, it is this movie that put her on the map of stardom and fame.  Now with the release of the unrated version, you get more blood in the opening and more sex in the middle.  Who ever said more is better was right.  This proves that right.  If you were or are  fan of the original, then get this one.  If you have never seen the movie before, watch this version.
1577311523|5.0|Tolles, \\" The Power of Now\\" is not about religion or who God is. It's about who we really are. We are all very much important, no matter what outer purposes we decide on in our lives.  <br />I am happy and enlightened more often now , than I am angry or depressed. I see no need to dwell on the past or worry about the future any longer. I now better understand the situation of the human race, the wars and the fear and illusion of control that is all around us. <br />By living in the present I am able to operate from peace and love as my mode of function instead of the fear, the depression, the anxiety or the anger that are not possible in the present.<br />All I have to do is accept that there is no \\"outer power\\" for me to connect to and it is always within me. I also accept that I have been ill as the entire human race has been ill for a long time. Nevertheless, we are all as whole and heeled as we can be at any moment that we chose the absolute presence known as \\"Now\\".<br />Thank God for Eckhart Tolle, this book and you. I already knew what I needed to know, but I was lacking the messenger to bring  my mind and heart toghether. I owe that to this book. <br />Sincerely,<br />Rob
0671027344|5.0|I haven't voluntarily completed a book in a while. I got stuck on A Prayer for Owen Meaney, and this was a refreshing change. The final 200 pages took me only a day of school to finish. The sentences are simple and to the point. Like Hemmingway almost. The story itself is a great tale about a boy trying to live a normal life, despite his unique nature. His simple, naive nature allows the reader to understand him completely. Charlie might not ever be normal, but his letters prove that happiness doesn't need to follow a paved road.
0684833395|3.0|Although critically acclaimed as \\" An Apocalyptic Masterpiece\\" by the Chicago Tribune  the absence of an on going plot prevents the reader from being consistently interested. Which thus at times gets a little boring to read after a while. However it's hilarious satire and distinguished characters makes this novel a must read.
B00008JLKL|4.0|I almost made this a 3-star on my very \\"first\\" run through of the ERA, The Mass.  And I listened again, and upped it another star as my expectations were (perhaps unfairly) enormous.  If you like Enigma, you MUST collect not only this CD but also the two prior CDs by ERA known as ERA and ERA, Vol 2 ...<br />I am an avid fan of ERA and have enormous expectations of their work.  While this is SLIGHTLY disappointing to my enormous expectations, it is very well done, nonetheless.<br />The reason for my one star knock-off is that they remixed some of what was done from the previous 2 pieces and not more refreshing new pieces.  Also, I do not understand for the life of me why Track #8, Sombre Day, is on this CD.  It does not flow whatsoever as it is a TOTAL classical piece that does not fit with the rest of the album.  It should have been removed and replaced with a piece with the choir.  The most touching piece by far is Track #4, Don't You Forget.  It will definitely bring you back to your own childhood with your \\"best friend\\" at the time -- GUARANTEED!<br />My advice: Buy ERA, The Mass.  I am hopeful that ERA reads feedback from their work and they will work on a totally fresh CD next time out and less classical and remixes of the past.
B00004NRWH|5.0|This is my opinion one of the best CD's that you can own from an alternative rock band.  They do it all well, hard songs, ballads, and tempo changing songs.  What more can you ask for?  If you haven't listened, you should.  If you have, try again your time will not be wasted!
B00005YUNY|4.0|Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Jon Anderson, Alan White give you a variety of music from a time when they competed with Journey/The Who/ Genesis / etc. What can you say about Steve Howe but what a great guitarists he is and he shows it in this concert. My favs on this are &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;,&quot;Starship Trooper&quot;,&quot;And you and I&quot;, and &quot;Ritual&quot; not becuase the other hits on here arenot good ... these just stand out. Its fantastic to see them play with a full young orchestra which at the end of the concert puts down their instruments and get up and dance. Chis Squires voice hits all the notes and brings you back to the days when rock concerts where about the music and not neccessarily the show. Buy this and you will not be dissapointed
0688163173|5.0|This is my first Lehane book and I was more than pleased. A very taut, well written story, Shutter Island gets your attention from the first page and doesn't let up.  I was really surprised by the ending which was quite an unexpected turn of events. Enough said; knowing the ending will spoil this great story. I particularly like Mr. Lehane's style. It is very direct, void of superflous narrative and descriptive details. He tells just what needs to be told and no more.  Character development is excellent and the plot moves right along with no impediments.  I plan to enjoy more of this author's books.
B00008J4P5|5.0|The only thing you can truly hate about The White Stripes is their so-called pretence, but then again pretence has been the driving force of artists ever since art was invented. When it comes to loving The White Stripes though there are a lot of reasons, but keeping up with The Stripes' spirit I'll only mention the three integral ones:<br />1. The White Stripes constantly limit themselves as artists, strictly following their own set of rules: wearing only black, white & red; using only equipment that predates 1963; & not using any bass (The \\"bass\\" you can hear on this album is in fact Jack's guitar being treated with an octave pedal). In other words, siblings Jack & Meg White are making it very hard on themselves. If you think that all of these limitations are pretentious as well, may I just remind you that the very essence of music is limitation. The idea of playing on scale equals limitation. No wonder The White Stripes manage to sound so exciting within the borders they've set.<br />2. Jack & Meg never cease to constantly prove us just what truly talented musicians they really are. Jack White is a rare talent in the current music world, with his honest lyrics, impassioned vocals & perhaps most importantly the soul he exudes when he plays the guitar (especially solos) which can only make you feel excited, enthused & full of verve. The simple middle part of \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is enough to make my heart jump up & down & move in loops like a roller-coaster. The sound of his guitar playing is very distinctive & unlike anything else in contemporary music. Meg White complements her brother with her drumming which can be both precise & lively, making her one of the best drummers I've ever heard; Let alone a female drummer, yet another rarity. On Elephant we even get to hear her sweet, evocative voice on the album's most tender & romantic ballad \\"In The Cold, Cold, Night\\". Together they take tried & tested musical styles, mostly old-flavoured American blues, to create something new & exciting. It's rather phenomenal how their music makes you forget they're only two people so quickly.<br />3. Combining the previous two elements, the music The White Stripes make can only be exciting & strikingly impressive. \\"Seven Nation Army\\" is easily the best single & video of 2003. With its Spanish-tinged riff & in-your-face lyrics, this song is literally the resurrection of good music. I can go on & on about the excitement (yes, that is the key word here) this song brings me to, where it is in fact written in response to gossip, a subject which the closing song \\"Well It's True That We Love One Another\\" also plays on quite humorously. Other songs on the album will try: & eventually succeed: in becoming your favourite songs by turn. The cover of \\"I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself\\" makes you forget it's a cover, which obviously indicates that it is, indeed, a very good cover. \\"Ball And Biscuit\\" should be the next single as Jack's guitar blows this song sky high with thrilling riffs & solos, it's a shame its length (seven minutes that makes you feel sorry they had to eventually end) will prevent it from becoming a single. Perhaps \\"The Hardest Button To Button\\" could make a more fitting choice then: Along with the much-praised \\"Seven Nation Army\\" they manage to electrify without using any computers. \\"Hyptonize\\" will make you jump & dance like mad with its fast pace, exciting melody & touching lyrics about conquering a girl's heart. \\"I Want To Be The Boy To Warm Your Mother's Heart\\" is my favourite song on Elephant, lyrically speaking. The line \\"I'm inclined to go finish high school just to make her notice that I'm around\\" is so relatable to me it's just brilliant, as the rest of this song is. The song is basically about trying to win a beloved girl by using the romantic methods you've been raised upon yet losing to contenders that are anything but charming. Another great edge to The Stripes' music is the optimism it conveys, a refreshing breakfrom the \\"dark\\" & \\"brooding\\" \\"nihilism\\" of some current artists: \\"Little Acorns\\" carries a positive message about solving your problems one at a time, thus dealing with them better; Whereas \\"Girl, You Have No Faith In Medicine\\" implores people to use what they know will help them feel better on a broader sense. Jack's great theatrical voice is also moving towards a slightly different direction on this album which is always great to hear.<br />Well, I think that covers up what I have to say about The White Stripes & Elephant, at least for now. Please excuse me for playing on the word \\"exciting\\" so much in this review, but it's just that it's been quite a long while since I've been so excited about a band before. Oh, & another thing: People should really stop mentioning bands like The Strokes, The Hives or The Vines whenever they talk about The White Stripes; Those three bands have absolutely nothing on Jack & Meg.
B00000I41G|5.0|Kenny Burrell's playing combines the most creative chord voicings with rhythmic intensity while never compromising the overallmood of the piece. On Midnight Blue his choice of chords and his melodic playing are so fluid and bluesy in the best sense of the word. Stanley Turrentine's sax blends perfectly with Burrell's guitar to create an irresistible groove. The rhythm section is also outstanding with a special nod to Major Holley on Bass. This is one of my all-time favorites and I highly reccomend it.
630587493X|4.0|This film was so sad! Someone lent it to me, and told me that it made them cry ... Thankfully, it didn't make me cry! Only two films make me cry, and that's Armageddon &amp; My Girl - sad I know.<br />I've vaguely heard of this film before, but that's due to my friend mentioning it. I don't remember it being out at the cinema - but then I never remember things like that. It did drag a bit, and I could have sliced a lot out of it. But it was so funny! You need to watch this, just if you're a fan of Robin Williams! (Even if he does say the jokes too fast and you can't catch all of them)<br />The weirdest bit of this film I thought, was where Oliver (Platt?) started making Andrew (the robot's) face, it turned into Robin William's face within two minutes of &quot;moulding&quot; it. Very weird to watch!<br />I got very confused at one point, as when Andrew is playing the piano with Little Miss, and she suddenly changes! I thought she was suddenly the mother. But they'd just sped forward about 15 years, without any warning. (They did the rest of the time, unless I was too blind to notice it.) I hated the way this film kept speeding forward through time.<br />I thought this film was three films rolled into one. The Green Mile (the whole immortality bit), The Terminator (I've just recently watched that and the bit where Andrew looks at his new family), and what was the other one? Of course, Mrs Doubtfire. Mainly because it's made by the same director, and it's just similar in little ways.<br />Sack the little girls, they were such bad actresses! The only thing the oldest one was good at was making a sulky face!<br />If you watch this film ... Make sure you've got tissues beside you. I didn't need them, but that's probably I got told beforehand it was sad. And it is kinda obvious what's coming.
B000002513|5.0|This is probably the best intro you can have to Bruce Springsteen. My personal favorite and the best soundtrack to anyone's college years. Rosalita rocks! Kitty's back is underrated, and New York City Serenade is Bruce balladry at its best. Lik Rosalita, you'll jump a little higher!
B00008S2VH|5.0|I love everything Madonna does. Im a huge fan. I think as she stated on Dateline, her fans have been growing with her. And if you are an 'original' fan of Madonna, I believe she is right. We were young when she started, and as she and her music has changed, so have we all. Some of the songs are more 'folky' but definately have a 'techno' feel to some of them as well. It shows where she has come from and how she has grown in the in the lyrics. My favorite song on the album is 'Nothing Fails'.
B00005YUTD|5.0|My 4-month old loves this video.  We only have 3 Baby Einstein videos so far - Baby Bach, Baby Mozart, and Baby Neptune - and he likes Bach the best.  He likes Baby Mozart well enough, but he tends to get bored with it, and won't always sit through the whole thing.  He probably likes it the least of the three.  Baby Bach, on the other hand, just entrances him.  Maybe he's more of a Bach fan than a Mozart fan, or maybe he just likes the images more.  It's hard to tell.  He also likes Baby Neptune better than Baby Mozart.
B0000042MY|5.0|Quite simply, this is the most moving and breathtaking soundtrack I've come accross. If you enjoyed the movie, the soundtrack will evoke the same feelings you experienced during the film. As my friend and I say, the music makes you want to go out and fight a war! Buy this album, you will never get sick of it.
0688163173|5.0|Stupefaction is the best word to describe my reaction to the out of left field ending of this work of taut prose. The book is as good if not better than Lehane's others. Better, I think, because of the whiplash frenzy you'll get rereading pages for clues missed when you're done. This is the first book in a long while that you'll have to read again immediately because you can't belive you missed that nugget, the key that unlocks genius of Shutter Island.
B00005JLK1|5.0|It wasn't as scary as I'd hoped, but it was a great movie nonetheless. The acting was very good, it had a GREAT story line and the twist was fantastic. It was more of a weird movie with a few scary moments. The gore scenes are just plain disgusting! Don't get me wrong, the gore isn't overdone, it's just done very vividly!<br />I give credit where credit is due. This movie was VERY WELL DONE, from the acting to the special effects, and it deserves much better reviews than others have given it. In fact, I'd love to know what are these people looking for?<br />I do have a complaint though...there is a little too much cursing for my liking. But this complaint of mine is a complaint I have with a lot of movies(I think the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies have too much cursing in them, so take that opinion for what it's worth). I realize there probably would be a lot of people saying the Lords name in vain if they were faced with the horror these characters were faced with. However, I took off a star for that, but added it right back because of all the unreasonable poor reviews given to this movie. I say, \\"A+ FOR A MOVIE WELL DONE.\\" THIS MOVIE IS A MUST HAVE for any spook-horror fans!!!
0553275976|5.0|First: the book is brilliant. It has some echoes of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" but a much larger canvas. Though it is very long and has some overblown descriptions it is absolutely engrossing. The focus of the book is Sherman McCoy, whom I found quite fascinating. He starts off quite unlikeable due to being an amazingly smug, arrogant snob. Then slowly one starts looling beyond these points. He is human after all and not all that bad. And that is true of all the other characters too, none is wholly good or bad. <br />In a book about great moral issues, Tom Wolfe describes in great detail his characters' concern about their appearance, their social success and their finances. But for most people these superficial things ARE major concerns in life which influence their actions and destiny.<br />Some of the earlier reviews have made a very interesting point. The themes of the book will never date but the plot as written could not have been set in the year 2003. Technology and media has changed so much in the last 20 years. <br />But as an Indian who has never visited America I am not able to judge many things. Is American society as unequal and divided as portrayed here? India certainly is, and if the story was transported here it would ring true. The poverty in India is so extreme and wide-spread that the comparatively well-off are almost forced to make a habit of \\"insulation\\". <br />Also: I dont for a moment think that Tom Wolfe could be racist. But it shows what a gap there must be between the races in America in that all the characters whose minds he explores are white. Non-whites are shown from the outside only. Similarly women are shown from the outside only. I understand that a male author may feel unable to speak about a woman's feelings. But are black males and white males so different?
B00005JKPF|4.0|X-Men 2 is one of those rare movie sequels which surpasses a good original. It's an action movie where the personalities outdid the special effects, and this movie has great special effects. Storm was amazing and she simply blew me away.<br />There might be a battle for which mutants came out as the favorites for the audience but in my opinion Storm, Wolverine and Mystique easily won. Everyone has their favorite X-Men characters and neither Fire nor Ice could change their minds. <br />The latest mutant added to the movie lineup, Nightcrawler, at times added the right touch of humor but at times he was straight out of Sesame Street. He is still not a bad addition to the mutant cast. The RX7, and hopefully not a mutated version, was a great choice for the X-Men 2 car. Storm and the 7, that should have been the combination.<br />Once again another Marvel Comic Book turned Movie and a success. <br />Nuff Said!
0446677450|5.0|I'm not a CPA, don't have an MBA and am probably about as financially literate as the average person. Yet this book was simple enough for me to understand and quite worth the read. Robert Kiyosaki makes very valid points about our educational system, what it fails to teach us, and how it breeds the middle-class rat race of endless debt. The book doesn't have all the answers but I feel like I at least have a starting point for what I have to learn to become financially free. <br />One last point - I actually listened to the Audio CD version of this book and it was simple enough to keep up with while commuting to and from my &quot;rat race&quot; job. Half way through I came back and ordered four more audio books from the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; series.
B000006OS2|1.0|If you look at the fine print on this DVD, you'll see that it is not approved by the Wayne Foundation.  And boy does it show.    The image quality of this DVD has all the earmarks of being a DVD recording of a VHS copy of the movie.  They didn't even bother to use a new VHS tape-- judging by the grainy texture and the annoyingly prevalent flaws (flickers, \\"hairs\\" on the screen, etc) it was captured from an old copy of the tape.  I have a VHS tape that has a better picture than this DVD.    Everyone PLEASE write the Wayne Foundation and tell them about the shoddy release of this movie!  If we make ourselves heard, we might be able to convince them to release widescreen, Criterion quality releases of John Wayne's less famous movies.      UPDATE:  PLEASE NOTE!    This review DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO THE SPECIAL EDITION.    Amazon is mixing all the McLintock! reviews in one bag.    I don't know what the quality of the Special Edition (released in October 2005) is, but it is not necessarily the same as the previous editions.
038572179X|5.0|The first half of Ian McEwen's stately \\"Atonement\\" takes place in 1935 (it's merely entitled Part 1 and it takes up 174 of the book's 351 pages). It's a conventional English novel of manners that will lure in fans of Jane Austen, Virginia Woolf, and Henry Green. In its numbered chapters, McEwan describes, using multiple points of view, how the 13-year-old Briony, a borderline sociopath possessed of a writer's imagination, sees her older sister Cecilia (called Cee) and her friend Robbie (he's a gardener who's been to Cambridge and wants to be a doctor) in what might be considered a compromising position, misinterprets what she sees (almost certainly deliberately), and finds that her actions have consequences, her lies believed.<br />Then, just as Beethoven suddenly, daringly tosses singers into what has been up to then a conventional classical symphony, the rest of the book goes off in unexpected directions, as we learn in parts 2 and 3 (each about half as long as part 1) what happens to Cee, Briony, and Robbie in the epochal year of 1940, during the British army's evacuation of Dunkirk and the German bombing of London.<br />These sections, we learn, are written by the imaginative Briony perhaps in an attempt to atone for her misinterpretation of events, or perhaps merely to prove to herself that she's an author worthy of being published. Or perhaps both. (Briony's grande geste, giving up her own chance to go to Cambridge to work as a nurse in a hospital is perhaps an over-dramatically way to atone.) One thing is certain: after the classical nature of the first part, the events here, not divided by chapters, tumble along almost out of control as they describe the horrors of war and then the horrors of the wounded as they are taken to hospitals.<br />Finally, in an eleagic (and more than somewhat self-serving) coda, dated 1999 and told in the first person by Briony, now 77 and near the end of her life, we get still another interpretation of events.<br />The prose is elegant; the emotions are raw. And in the end you'll wonder whether there's been any atonement at all. You may even wonder if it matters.<br />The book has an ice-cold crystalline clarity that resonates. It's not to be adored; it's to be admired. If you can.elegant; the emotions are raw. And in the end you'll wonder whether there's been any atonement at all.

B00008S2VG|3.0|Though the soundscapes on this album are compelling and vibrant, and Madonna's voice has never been stronger (or lovelier), I personally found the lyrics on this album narcissistic and inane to the point of distraction. I actually quite like Madonna and think &quot;Ray of Light&quot; is one of the best albums of our time, but listening to &quot;American Life,&quot; I felt badgered by her megalomania and self-interest. &quot;I like this, I don't like this, I was so young when this and this happened to me, you don't know me, let me tell you more about why I don't care what you think of me and what do you think of that?&quot; Even the love songs are self-centered and self-serving. I really wanted to like this, but I ended up giving it away. I still think it has value musically, and I understand that she probably has to be pretty self-involved to be as successful as she is -- maybe you could even argue that she's consciously making a point about the self-referential shallowness of &quot;American Life&quot; -- but the effect is engaging music that it's strangely impossible to engage with.

0385504209|3.0|I have read many of the reviews posted here, and I don't get it!<br />Why are some of you taking this book so seriously? Folks, this is a novel, not history. Why do some of you say this is all true and some of you say it is all fiction. Years of research on the topics would be needed in order to make an intelligent commentary. I found myself going to websites and getting very basic information on Opus Dei, The Knights of Templer, The Grail and \\"The Last Supper\\" by DaVinci (the resolution on my computer is not that good and as such confirming some of the of the statements was impossiple). I found that this basic resaerch made the book more enjoyable.<br />As for the religious implications. First of all this book is not anti-Christian. The book presents alternative views to those that Christians believe in. Christians are the entire goup of people that believe that Christ was the son of God and died for the sins of all man kind. The only religous group that is ever mentioned in this book is the Catholic church. One one else. Christians are not bashed here, only some of their beliefs.So, if you say it is Catholic bashing, I respect your opinions.<br />I also can not understand that some say this is boring. Surely you jest. This is an exciting story.<br />Predictable? Yes. You will know who the master is 20 pages after he is introduced.<br />Factual? Yes and no.<br />Educational? I learned a great deal by doing research on the Web. Books should make you think.<br />Fun? No doubt about it.<br />Controversial? You bet.<br />If you like a good mystery, you should enjoy this book.<br />Oh, one other fact, this is such an improvement over \\"Deception Point\\" that I reviewed last year. Now that was truely awful.<br />Later.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Nemesis was a good movie despite what everyone says about it. It most likely is the Next Generation's Final Journey and it a fitting end to a good series. because lets face it, only die hard Trekkie's are into DS9 and Voyager. Im my opinion, Star Trek ends for a while with the end of this movie. Enterprise is another avenue, but again is not as popular as The Next Generation. It would be nice if one final Next Generation was made, but I don't think it will happen. Star Trek needs to unfortuantely disappear again into deep space for another 10 or 15 years and be remember, but not forgotten and then a new series or movie can possibly come out with a good story that will enterain viewers yet again to the Star Trek saga. I think that is the only way it will be able to live long and prosper the future. Its been overdone and needs a slight rest. To watch Nemesis is sad because I think we all know deep down, this is the last Trek we will be on for quite a while. A job well done to the performances of the Next Generation crew. They get better in every movie and I grew up with this series watching it and they have given me more than most people I've met in my life. I'll miss the Next Generation crew -Mike
B00005KHEU|5.0|i think this album is perfect for the ELO fanatics out there as well as people who just love GOOD music. All the tracks are fairly familiar ELO but i have to say,the Standout cuts to me are Midnite Blue and Last train to London. They are BOTH worthy additions to the ELO canon of GREAT songs. Although ELO'S prime was long past at that point,Discovery Proves that at this point,jeff lynne and company still had what it takes.
068484267X|5.0|In my High School Independent Literature class, I was given the assignment to read a multi-cultural book and the book I chose was Angelas Ashes, by Frank McCourt.  I had heard many great things about it and I had wanted to read it for a long time. After reading it, and reading a few of the reviews, I agreed with every word that people said about it. <BR>       Angelas Ashes is about Frank McCourts life as a young boy growing up in a run down apartment in New York and living in the poverty stricken society in Limerick, Ireland. Franks father was an extreme alcoholic and would come home almost every night wreaking of different smells from the pub and having his boys promise to die for Ireland. If that was not enough for young Frank to deal with, he also lost three of his siblings to consumption. It was while living in Ireland Frank promised himself hes move back to America to create a better life for himself and his family.<BR> The ideal audience for this book is probably around the ages of fifteen years old and up.  I feel that some of the actions taken place in Franks book should not be read by young readers. For example, Frank would describe some of the horrible things he witnessed or did himself which might influence younger children. Another reason why this book is targeted more for the young adults is because of the language used.  Even when Frank was young, he would say cuss words that most adults would use. It wasnt Franks fault he began cussing at an early age, it was all he knew. He had grown up with the drinking, smoking, and cussing all his life.<BR>       One of the most powerful literacy elements that Frank McCourt used in his book was the technique of suspense.  He continually used suspense to pull you into his life story.  Franks life was constantly filled with sorrow and pain and when his baby sister died and he used suspense as a way to tell you the story behind his mothers actions. You never knew if Franks mother wasgoing to get through the death of her daughter or not. Another literacy element Frank used was imagery.  Frank used imagery in his book to describe the lanes of Limerick. Frank lived in a run down old house and he used imagery to describe the way the house smelled, looked, and felt. <BR>       While reading this book, my emotions were going wild. I was mad and in shock of how selfish Franks father was, yet at the same time I felt sorry for him. As I mentioned before, alcoholism was a reoccurring theme in this book and from it I have learned the true horrors behind it. Alcoholism is a disease that people cannot control. It takes time and Franks father never took that time. Franks father spent his daily wages at the pub even before Frank was born and the hassles of a busy day drove him to drink. When Margaret, Franks baby sister, was born something inside of Franks father made him realize he needed to control his drinking, but when she died, his drinking only got worse!  It is because of his actions I have learned that alcohol is never the way to get rid of your problems.<BR>       Over all, I really enjoyed reading this book! If I were to give this book a rating, I would give it a five out of five.  It is hard to put excitement and tragedy all into one book, but Frank McCourt did it. I highly recommend people read this book if they enjoy suspense mixed in with a little bit of comedy.

0140390693|4.0|The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy. <BR>At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams. <BR>Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family. <BR>I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will.
0812548094|1.0|I really enjoyed the first volume in this series.  There were one or two places where I winced at the obvious &quot;borrowing&quot; of characters and concepts from other fantasy series, but there was a lot of creativity there to counterbalance those minor lapses.<br />I cannot say the same about this second volume.  I was shocked at concept after concept that appeared to have been lifted directly from Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, shifted slightly in context, then placed into Goodkind's storyline.<br />Eventually I became too distracted by the large amounts of &quot;borrowed&quot; material to be able to enjoy the creative and original aspects of the story (which were less in evidence here than in the first volume), so I am sending this one off to the used book store -- unfinished.
068484267X|4.0|Angela's Ashes appeals to people of all ages, an aspect which I think has greatly affected its popularity. When the story begins, Frankie McCourt is a young Irish-American boy traveling with his family back to Ireland from New York City.  He tells his tale of hunger in poverty stricken Limerick, Ireland where fleas are always more plentiful than food, of never having shoes or winter coats because his father would drink away any scarce money they could manage and of his pain in dealing with the constant loss of siblings.  However, though the tale is laiden with depressing events, a happy tone comes through at times and you see that no matter how poor or sick the family becomes, the family is still as strong and loving as ever.  You hear Frankie mature in his storytelling as the memories go on and as his voice is as strong and clear as any.  This is a major element to the book because it gives it a true life and character.  At the start of the story Frank is a very young child and you can tell it by how he uses language in the book.  His words are smaller and more simple and many times when talking to adults he will say that he \\"doesn't understand what they meant\\" by something or guesses at what they mean and comes off very juvenile.  For instance the way he took his father seriously when he said that there was an angel on the seventh step of their home.  As the book then progresses you see Frank's words become more complex, ideas more mature and his understanding of why things happen become more apparent.  Also he seems to understand the situation his family is in, namely their impoverishment.  This was something that early on in the book he is completely oblivious to.  <BR> I enjoyed this book and I think that everyone should at least give it a try.  It really made me realize how lucky I am to have a house with a roof, a fridge full of food and clothes that haven't been patched up with tire scraps.  I think that after reading this I have a better appreciation for all I have and the family that will always be there to support me.-NGonwa
0385720920|5.0|Palahniuk is by far one of the most disturbing authors I've read in a long time. He is a mixture of Kurt Vonnegut at his more witty and sarcastic, Don Delillo when he views society, and the carnal side of William S. Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg. Choke is basically about a con artist who deals w/ a sex addiction, a mother w/ Alzheimer's, and pretends to choke on food at restaurants to earn money. He is also a med-school dropout who works as an indentured servant at some colonial theme park. <br />The main character, Victor Mancini, is a very tragic and tortured man, like many of the characters in this book. He can't make his real self talk to his Alzheimer's stricken mother when he goes to visit her, instead putting on a bogus alias and their relationship was obviously very tortured. He also deals w/ a major sex addiction which he cannot seem to overcome no matter how hard he tries. Choke is another example of Palahniuk's grim view of society, like his novel Fight Club, and it symbolizes the death of the American dream, by revealing the ugly side to society, such as illness, corruption, addiction and war (both political and personal). Choke is not a book for everybody, obviously. For me it was too hard to put down, with suspense and curiosity literally bouncing off of every page, but it's hard to fathom what would happen next in Victor Mancini's insane life, and it was too disturbing to ignore. Perhaps this is one of the most bizarre and disturbing books I've read in my life. After I put it down I was in awe, and I didn't know what to feel. It was very powerful, but it was also very negative the way Palahniuk ignores the beauty in society and literally plunges straight into a Hedonistic and corrupted underworld.

This is a book that anyone who is ambitious and interested in success should read. I don't think that leaves many people out! Several reviewers have also mentioned Norman Thomas Remick's book, &quot;West Point: Character Leadership...&quot; as a great follow-on to &quot;Good To Great&quot;. I have now read it and can subscribe to its being an intriguing look into the more basic reasons for success. I am now recommending both books to everyone in the world who makes enquires to our consulting firm.
0375414053|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Pearson accurately captures the brutal balancing act of a high powered mother/career woman. She also moves the reader with her descriptions of the miracle of children. One line-children are the answer to the riddle-stayed with me.<br />My only reservation about the book: it is not laugh out loud funny the entire time. I realize that it is not supposed to be and I respect the author for her choices. But even some of her humorous passages could have been sharper.<br />I would recommend this book for women who enjoy the Bridget Jones, Nanny Diaries genre. Pearson captures one demographic of the contemporary woman well. I would not recommend this book for women who want either too much humor or poignancy-Pearson balances both in this book as her heroine juggles mother and career.
B000068TPN|5.0|I didn't even see this film until a Viet Nam Vet told me that it was the truest depiction of that senseless war.  I missed being drafted by just one year, but now I understand what my veteran friends have tried to describe.<br />I rarely purchase DVDs, but this is one I had to add to my library. You will laugh and you will cry. It's truly an example of excellent filmmaking and acting. But it makes me remember when a senior MP officer once told me that he investigated over 300 American soldier suicides in just one year in Viet Nam. And how he was instructed to list every suicide as &quot;killed in action.&quot;<br />This is a true story.  It should  be required viewing for high school history students.  The R-rating on this one should stand for Required.
0786867973|5.0|How many times can you say that a cookbook is thoughtful? Yet, Nigella Lawson injects so much insight and thinking into her writing about the art of baking. This book is as much a treat to read as her delicacies are to eat. <BR>Lawson's recipes are straightforward and relatively simple (she warns you when there is work). I would heed other reviewers' cautions about keeping an eye on the fats-clearly, she does not worry about cholestrol. However, all of the recipes that I have tried (about 10-15) worked beautifully both when I modified the fats and when I didn't. <BR>I would recommend this book for the beginner who wants to try baking and the more experienced cook who wants to think about it. I would not recommend this book for anyone looking for ways to cut calories out of his or her diet!
0064409422|5.0|CS Lewis is perhaps best-known for his Chronicles of Narnia series of children's books, of which this was the first written.  In fact, the book is second in chronological order, but this was the first book Lewis wrote and published, and I consider it to be the first of the series.  This is a story about four children who are staying at an enormous house in the country with an old Professor.  One day, Lucy (the youngest) finds a door (inside a wardrobe) to the magical world of Narnia.  This leads to a whole series of adventures, in which they join forces with a magical lion named Aslan to combat a wicked witch.<BR> <BR>This is a wonderful fairy-tale type story for children, but there is a lot of religious symbolism here as well.  Above all, Lewis was a master Christian apologist, and many Christian symbols and values appear in this book.  Aslan is a Christ figure, a selfless being who sacrifices himself for another, and who rises again and brings about a sort of \\"resurrection\\" of other animals when he restores to life various creatures who have been turned to stone.  Edmund, the youngest brother, is a symbol of a lost and selfish soul who goes seeking for evil, finds it, is enthralled by it, and finally redeems himself by practicing virtue.  Throughout the book there are numerous Christian references, no doubt an attempt by Lewis to make these stories teach children the right kind of values.  <BR> <BR>I am certain that one of Lewis's aims in writing this story was to inspire good moral living among children, to show what sort of behavior is acceptable, and what is not.  Note also his many jabs against the school system, especially those made by the Professor.  In fact, it is the new school Edmund attended which was the cause of his nastiness and selfish attitude.  There are many hints of Lewis's philosophy and theology here, and readers of his other works (for example, his books Miracles and the Abolition of Man) will find the values he advocates in those books put into practice here.  <br />These books serve a dual purpose.  They are very entertaining for children, and they also provide some very essential lessons.  This is what has made the Chronicles of Narnia constantly popular, both among children and among adults.
6305428425|3.0|This film milks the most out of what is a pretty [poor] plotline.  Two fun-loving but less than intellectually astute blondes (let's just say that they're not the type of people whom you engage in the Hegelian dialectic with) find out that their 10 year high school reunion is coming up.  As they both lead what they believe to be very \\"ordinary\\" lives, they have a plan to lie about their professions so as to impress their former classmates.<br />The strongest point of this DVD is its cute satire of what can & does happen at HS reunions.  So many times the people who were thought to be \\"shoe-ins\\" for success end up falling flat on their faces.  Meanwhile, the quiet people whom nobody ever paid any attention to end up becoming mega-successful.  This is a theme that is played out in a myriad of ways throughout the film.<br />It is demonstrable that Mira Sorvino is a dynamic actress who can play just about any kind of character there is.  She could easily go from playing a ditzy girl in the present film to playing college professor in her next project if she so chose.<br />It remains to be seen how far Lisa Kudrow's talents can stretch.  The clueless blonde she plays in this story is pretty much a clone of her FRIENDS persona.  I'd like to see her in a role that she's not typecast as.<br />The good news for this film is that Kudrow and Sorvino work well with each other.  They are believable as best friends who have virtually never been apart.  If nothing else, we get to view Kudrow in about a dozen different hairstyles during the movie, and she looks FABULOUS in all of them!<br />If you're looking for a cheesy flick that has some satirical moments, this movie is worth a look.  It's not hilariously funny, but there are some comical moments.  It's not a movie you will think about much after watching it, but it's just good enough to make you happy you saw it once.
B000002MH5|5.0|Most people I know (who like dinosaur jr) hate this album they say j mascis vocals are rough and annoying. But I dont think so once you get used to the vocals there quite normal. This is where dinosaur jr started to get noticed on the pop rock scene (but back in 1993 it was grunge) but they didnt get very far. J mascis is also a great guitarist and in some cases can pull of three perfect solos in one song (get me) but in others he kinda overpowers his style (I aint sayin). My fave track would be either \\"get me\\" or \\"not the same\\". Not the same has some of the most beautiful meldoies ever and get me is an underated clasasic. My least fave would be \\"I aint sayin\\" why? because \\"I aint sayin\\" is just filler... Also skip drawerings. Dont start your dinosaur jr collcetion with this one start it with green mind and get used to J's vocals there then move on to this one.
0780622642|1.0|Ack, how did this steaming pile of cinema ever get made?<BR>Matt Leblanc proved his acting talents peaked with \\"Friends\\", but then again with such a lousy script, I'm not even sure Harrison Ford could have attempted such lines and come out with his career unscathed.<BR>William Hurt is miscast here.  He just doesn't strike me as the idealistic scientist type with his low key mumbling.  The space uniforms were very wierd....watching Lacey Chabert (presumably 14 years old at the time) wearing a skintight outfit ... makes ya feel wierd, though I didn't mind it much on the older chicks.<BR>Gary Oldman plays his tired evil-guy sniveling role yet again, and while its nice to have cute kids and robots in movies, this is definitely not a kiddie film with all the violence and stuff blowing up.
B0000029GA|5.0|Man this is a classic album has some ov the best beats ov all time Nasty Nas has some one the best lyrics ever The best song ever is &quot;Halftime&quot; this a great album just pick this album up.
B00000JGEH|5.0|Its a classic.   Just watch it.<br />Simple Review: 1)  Its violent, be warned  2) Its full of obscure dark humor  3) Its well done considering the budget they had.<br />Bad stuff:  Terminator has an Austrian Accent, couldn't be helped.
B00005JLRT|5.0|This film is unfairly criticized. I think it stands alone as a wonderful movie, that leaves the viewer with much to think about. True to the Star Trek formula, this movie does a great job of showing us what it is to be human. I cried in this movie.
0375422307|5.0|Wonderful memoir of not only Marjan Satrapi but the generation who share almost all of her experience written so beautifully and so sincerely.<br />It's also a very accurate image of those years. It makes you laugh, and it brings tears to your eyes at the same time. No matter what your interests and tastes, you will enjoy if not love Persepolis.<br />Avisheh M.
0385504209|2.0|The Davinci Code unfolds as a Grail Quest, but it's really just a wild goose chase.  The book has to be one of the most sacreligious books in recent memory; doing for Christianity what Muslims felt the Satanic Versus did for Islam.
0140177396|5.0|Wonderful story of friendship, sacrifice and self-denial. Ordinary &quot;common man&quot; his trails and tribulations, his goals and dreams in an account of his daily life experiences. Excellent for classroom discussions and character study, especially for freshmen high school students. Often required reading and is a good beginning book for students learning analytical skills.<BR>Evelyn Horan - author<BR>Jeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl Books One-Three
B00005JLR1|4.0|I could probably count the number of animated films I've watched on one and a half hands; I'm just not that keen on animation, or sci-fi, for that matter. So when the kids I was baby-sitting wanted to share their new favorite movie with me I wasn't really expecting much real enjoyment. I was in for a surprise. The over-all story was good, even if I'm not so crazy about wierd space creatures or violence. But it was really rather intelligent, perhaps thanks to the influence of Stevensen. I also loved the British touch Emma Thompson brought to her character(the types of films she's in is more in my line than Disney). I was certain it was her voice, and was delighted to see my recognition was correct at the end. Anyway, I still think the things kids are watching these days are way too violent and scary, and there were scenes I would think a little too intense for young ones, but there actually is enough in the film to keep someone like me amused. The characterizations were really well done, even if some of the story-line was a little thin in places. I only give it 4 stars because it still isn't my style of film, and however good isn't going to convert me to scf-fi or animation.:-)
B00008NG5V|5.0|Personally I think this should have been an addition to the last album. The songs have that same great laid back feeling, they're smooth with lots of grooves. Sure this album is just like the last album, but that is not a bad thing. After I first heard Jack Johnson, I wanted more, and now I got it. He hasn't changed the style, the production level, or anything else that artists sometimes do to &quot;improve&quot; their sales. He's just Jack.
B0000931OG|5.0|Praise: Blur sound rejuventated on &quot;Think Tank&quot; their first cd in four years. The songs have a more apparent melody and are much shorter and concise compared to the sprawling &quot;13&quot; (1999)and the over-long &quot;Blur&quot; (1997). This could be a modern rock classic since 12 of the 13 tracks are well produced and memorable. I personally enjoyed &quot;Ambulance&quot;, &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;, &quot;Good Song&quot;, &quot;Brothers and Sisters&quot;, &quot;Jets&quot; and &quot;Gene By Gene&quot;.<br />Criticism: Not much to complain about here. The cd took me a few listens to get into and the centerpiece of album, &quot;Caravan&quot;, is a sure dud.<br />Conclusion: I'm surprised this cd entered the top 200 albums chart at something like 60. That's a shame, I thought Blur had more fanbase in America. However, this means this cd could be overlooked and found years from now on top music lists. The sound on this disc is hard to categorize but might be modern rock/blues/psychedelica a la Pink Floyd and such peers as Radiohead and Oasis. Definitely worth looking into.
B000069AUI|5.0|In tradition of U2's Joshua Tree, Radiohead's OK Computer, and anything by the Doors, Coldplay release an album that rocks in a fevered way. The guitar is unafraid to work it, the drum lines are driving, and the vocals are... are... well they are absolutly amazing. This album is for anyone who declares themselves a music fan. Great pop songs enhanced with beauty, creativity, and the best lyric to represent freedom and absolute joy, \\"I'm going to buy this place and burn it down.\\"
B00008977N|1.0|I think I have an answer to what some people are seeing. I think what happened is they over did the macrovision signal when mixing the main concert. I have an apex player. The menus and extras and preview play great. However, when I play the main concert it's a mess. Blotches and other problems come and go all through the show. Can the people that have problems try it in a different player and verify. Can the people that don't seem to have problems list the player.
