B002UNMW7O|5.0|Before I bought this movie, I was wondering why it got so many 3, 2 and 1 star reviews. I guess I see where they're coming from now. It definitely doesn't have the same feel as the first movie. It feels a little scripted, a little forced, a little cheesy, the music doesn't fit, the female FBI agent is fairly annoying... That being said, you may ask 'Why 5 stars?'. Well, I really wanted to love it but, the first third of the movie, I really wasn't feeling it. It was like a bad B-movie and not in a good, cult classic kind of way. The second third of the movie hit its stride and really got me laughing! The drinking scene with F*** A** (Can't swear in the reviews, even though it's kinda the guys name...) is hilarious! \\"Shut up! Romeo's cryin'.\\" gets me every time! And when Greenly listened to 'Sister Christian', I almost peed myself laughing! Then, the final third, a main character dies and the boys have a dream about Rocco and I cried... Hard... Then, another character dies and I cried all the way through until the end. So, yes, the movie tries a little too hard to recapture the feel of the first movie and draws painfully obvious parallels (-Yakavetta Jr. incorrectly pronouncing words like Dolly.<br />-Pretending to shoot Romeo like they did with Rocco in the Russians hotel room.<br />-Fighting in the crate like they did in the ducts.<br />-Greenly and his breath spray.<br />-Bloom's earplugs like Smecker's music.<br />-The whole rope situation...) but, if you can just let go of your expectations and watch the movie for what it is (Everyone from the first movie getting together 10 years later to reminisce, have fun and make a cheesy sequel.) you should enjoy it. It took a few minutes but, it definitely grew on me and is now one of my favorites!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|If you want all the movies and you don't care about much else, then this is perfection. No special features and no bonus material. Just the movies in all their glory. This is exactly what I wanted. All the movies come in one case and it's not a crumby cardboard one. t's a normal multi-disk plastic case. Just a great buy overall.
B004IPPINW|5.0|I found The Reluctant Fundamentalist to be extremely well written and thought provoking.  I had first seen the movie, which was a completely different story.  That was very strange and I'm not sure why it was changed so drastically.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Slow starting but the story really picks up. If I could have read it contunually it may have head my interest more.
B002SHD9E2|4.0|Different from the Broadway video, but still good.<br />If you like this Andrew Llloyd Weber music, you will like this play!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like is pretty cool love the colours too cute very addictive and fun love the new level very nice
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book is probably best read at the beach. It is pretty mindless. The characters are not very well developed and you really don't care about them even with the predicitable ending.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is far and away superior to the regular android keyboard. If you avail yourself of its learning capabilites by letting it scan your email, FB and twitter, it will look at your words choices and order it can more accurately predict not only what word you're trying to type, but also what words are likely to come next. This will allow you to be faster, and more importantly, more efficient with swype when composing texts and notes. It's great.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I can't stop watching it! One episode leads to another and you won't be able to stop. Excited about what will happen next.
0761169431|5.0|Looks like brand new. No missing pages, no marks.  Great!! My son loved his origami book and started making some of the projects.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|We need more movies as wholesome and entertaining as this one !!!<br />  It will keep you involved and enthralled the whole time.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|We don't watch regular TV and we are very selective about what we watch.  This would be appropriate.  I don't know why I waited so long to watch this.  This got the kids laughing and giggling....and singing the songs!  A bit long, but the kids won't mind.  It gets their imaginations going.<br />I guess I see Mary Poppins like an angel type of character.<br />The end is good.  Mary elevates the father's role in the children's lives as being more important than her role.  I like that!  No putting the father down.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Although I do not know anyone who has been on an orphan train, I am familiar with journeys and new beginnings and feelings.  I feel that this book helped me to relive some of my own journey and the journeys of members of my family.<br /><br />This book tells the story of two lives -- a ninety-year-old woman orphaned right before The Great Depression and a sixteen-year-old growing up with foster families.  I feel as if I know these two women.  I hear their voices in my mind.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|To me the second one is the best 'MOVIE' I've seen that stands alone whether it's a batman movie or not. it's just nice, fresh, original, dark, funny, sad, creative, and great music, good editing and great story line.  I don't care how many batman movies comes out, the second one is going to be hard to beat, especially that bat mobile in it! I'll just say one thing.. it ain't a tank! hahah anyway, so pretty good movies. :) Give em a shot.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book! It's the first by this author but not my last!  The book was somewhat predictable, but a very good read, non the less.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|After this authors first two books I was` looking forward to reading this but found it difficult read. No flow and some of the important issues seem to have been not dealt with adequately. Did this book for our book club and all of us felt the same.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is better than I expected. Great plot and timing. The imagery she used though out the whole book was amazing. Can't wait to read the final book
B00992CF6W|5.0|I say to the people who made this game possible to us all I say with the best regards THANK YOU ME my bro play each day and we love it I just can't wait for the nexted update!!!!:)
B003R50FRI|5.0|Riveting read. Loved the aurthors descriptive talent. Exciting and transports the reader.I actually could imagine people, places and events as if i was there. LOVED IT
B005K8H8W0|5.0|Billy and company have completely outdone themselves with this composition- just unbelievably good-better described as great. A lot reviewers have articulated the absolute genius found here, and I won't be as detailed, but with brevity in mind...just buy it- and really sit down and listen. You'll get it.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|The thing I love the most about Brandon Sanderson's works, is that each series is its own work. Even the writing styles are different when going from Steelheart, to Stormlight, Mistborn, or Rithmatist. Each story is written in its own style.<br /><br />Take Steelheart for example. It's written as a young adult sci-fi/adventure novel by an author that writes high end epic fantasy. While the pseudo-cursing \\"Sparks!\\" was a touch annoying, everything else about the book was just plain awesome. The characters grow and learn as the story continues, there are plot twists here and there, and the final climactic scene was (in my opinon) done perfectly. The main Character, David, as well as other characters are given unique personality quirks that are entertaining.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book like I enjoy all of Sanderson's works and I impatiently await the next book in the series next fall.<br /><br />P.S.  As for the title of my review, just think about David's quirk.  Then you should get it and hopefully laugh.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|Very good I can't take my eyes off my TV set hope to see more episodes for this series. Thanks starz
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|I have always loved Trent's ability to put new sounds and textures on his albums, and that's what I love about his music.  However, except for 'All Time Low' and 'Copy of A' which are both really really good, there are songs like 'Everything' which is over-produced pop rubbish in my headspace, and a lot of things like background singers and studio sound here.  It's like someone snuck into Trent's studio and scrubbed all the grit and grime for every available surface.  It's precisely that that makes this album not so much a NIN album but a Trent Reznor (or maybe the man who he has become) album that feels like at least 1/3 of it was faked in a studio filled with white Ikea furniture and very little else.<br />I don't dislike the album, but I don't really enjoy it as I have with all previous material except maybe for 'The Slip' which I don't care for much either. Like Slip, it has a few songs which will go in to my NIN playlist, but most of it will stay out and end up at the bottom of my recently played stack.  This album feels really rehearsed and studio produced, and while some people will like that, I don't prefer this sound. I have always loved Trent's ability to tap in to raw emotion and make it squirm through the music but there is a disturbing lack of that feeling on 'Hesitation Marks'.
0802473156|5.0|My husband & I were having some comunication trouble, so when a friend recommended this book, I ordered it.  We take about 2 chapters per week to read & discuss.  It has helped us understand each other better.
B005PK56TA|5.0|loooove american horror story(all seasons) its freaking weird but i love it! I'm sure(and hope) they can continue to come up with more twists and turns.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best TV series in years ! Amazon Instant Video is very easy to use - Can't wait for Season 4
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The reason I liked this book so much is that for me it was a page turner that I really liked the characters.  It might have not been written as cleverly or good as Gone Girl but at least I liked the characters.  I kept on wondering why I had not heard more about this book or Author.  Hope more people start reading it and I have gone out and rented her other books from the library
B006PERRMY|3.0|A different take on the poor against the 1%?  A new slant on the &#34;Patty Hearst&#34; story?  It was o.k.  Not even memorable.<br /><br />DramaNana
6304602944|4.0|Stallone and Russel are great together in this movie.  2 ace cops that are very different in every way but get the job done in their own way.  They are both set up for a crime, put in prison, then break out to catch the ruthless criminal responsible. Plenty of action, violence and humor. Recommended
1439102813|5.0|This book was recommended at a meeting when our group shared &#34;good books they have read lately.&#34;  I wanted to read it based on that recommendation, but also because my grandparents have dementia.  This book was engaging and insightful.
B00003CXB6|3.0|First off this movie cannot compare to the 1st movie.  If it were not for Jeff Goldblum as lead actor I probably wouldnt have purchased it. And where did this brat girl come from? All she did was cause truoble throughout the movie. The T-Rex sequence demolishing the trailer was the highlight for me. Buy the movie to complete the series...not the best sequel that's for sure..
B000NDI3SK|5.0|Bought it in Europe, at a discounted price. I lost it when it was made, I think they never aired it in Italy, were I lived.<br />One of the many thing we lost together with Dr WHO (only 22 instalments!) The Hitchhiker guide to the Galaxy and so on.<br />Now I see it from time to time: it has a message of hope, we need it!
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|Was given as a present and they were happy to receive it. They said that the movie played well, so there is no complaints here.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i was thinking about getting this for my 52\\" 120hz 1080p LCD but i dont need it when i already have a Windows 7 PC, Nintendo Wii-U, Cable Box, Set Top Box, standalone Blu-Ray player, and coming soon to the room will be a PS4. All connected with HDMI 1.4 cables which support 3D, ethernet and audio return, i dont even use netdix i download my hd quality tv shows and blu ray rips and music using utorrent and jdownloader why would i need to waste my last hdmi port for this device when i already have enuff of what it offers already, no thank you i dont even like google chrome its a gay browser better than internet explorer tho but will never be greater than firefox..my devices all run through the 5 GHz band on my dual band network. But I changed my mind I am going to probably by one for others to use their netflix on my tv through this and wifi which will be close to 100% since i have a 2 range extenders in this room. Also for the smart phone and tablet streaming etc.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|I totally love this movie and to find it on blu-ray cheaper the DVD is always a cool deal. It came in quickly which is good too
B0034DGPEU|5.0|At first I was a little overwhelmed with all of the characters, but the author wove them together so well.  It is a very captivating read.  I would definitely recommend this book.
B00004Y6NP|3.0|The CD itself was not damaged - but the cd jewel case it came in was damaged and would not close securely.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to play alone or with your partner. It makes you think, practice memory skills and get creative with what clues go where. Awesomeness and free! Gotta love it.
B004LQJPEG|5.0|The French Connection is an Excellent movie,  lots of action-car chase. A true story.  I had been looking for this movie for quite a few years-finally found it here at Amazon.<br /><br />I give this a 10 star rating.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Omg I love this game so much it's so  fun and I love  minions so it  perfect !!!!! :) I definitely recommend it
B0063IH60K|4.0|Like this game. Wish there were a few different versions of solitaire on one game so didn't have to download and purchase so many different games to have variety.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Mr. Sanderson has costed me innumerable hours of sleep, and I love his writing for that reason.  However, that's the not case with this book.  I constantly find myself putting the book down in favor of some other activity, or turning out the lights as opposed to reading just one more chapter 74 times.  And I think that's very telling.<br /><br />Still, it's a solid 3/3.5 star book and I don't regret the purchase.  If you like Sanderson, buy it, kill it quickly, then count the days until Words of Radiance(Way of Kings) is released.  :-)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Gripped from beginning to end...can't wait to read the rest of the series.  Such an amazing and terrifying concept of the future.
071815780X|5.0|Love this cookbook, everything is delicious and doable. I like it better than the 30 minute meal cookbook. I logged all the recipes I tried here [...]
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This novel kept me hooked from the very beginning. Told from many character perspectives, you can't help but keep reading to see how they all come together. It's a page turner!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Love this app. I use it every night to fall asleep. You can create your own mixes and then use a timer to shut off when you want it to. Also, it constantly adds new sounds that you can choose to download.
B003EY7IUY|1.0|I thought Becky became intolerable in book 4. She was funny if irresponsible in the first 3 books, but how can someone still be making the same idiotic mistakes years later? She's a mother now and still tremendously immature and still getting into situations that someone else has to get her out of. Her charm has definitely worn off.
B00ADQCBEY|1.0|Very unrealistic, ridiculous depiction of police work. Any police officers acting like this would be fired very shortly. Waste of TV space.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Oh my God, this book! Like author Adam Makos, I had never really considered the German side of the air war during WWII. I hadn't read books about their aces or wondered what the war and its aftermath were like for them. I didn't realize how few of them belonged to the Nazi party, how they continued to fly in a war they knew they would lose, or how little training they had before being launched against the stronger, better trained, better supplied Allies. I didn't think Franz's story would get to me, but it really did. What an amazing story, and after all the losses and all the fighting, his humanity was still intact. This book is gripping, page-turning, and excellent, and I thank Adam Makos for giving us this gift. Just incredible.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I would recommend this to anyone who like erotic stories. The love scenes can be very graphic and so frequent that it can distract from the wonderful story of relationships and the challenges that they face.
B003NX75B8|4.0|Another book that is so good, I don't even know what to say. It will make you laugh. It might make you cry. It should most definitely make you exam what love is whether it is straight love, gay love, or friend love. Since none of what I typed comes even close to explaining this book, I will just share my favorite lines that made me LOL (yes, Will Grayson #2, I DID actually laugh out loud) and that last one made me LOL/really think about how we define love:<br /><br />\\"and it's not like I'm really that gay. I [expletive] hate Madonna.\\"<br />Will Grayson # 2<br /><br />\\"I know she is dating Douchepants McWater Polo...\\"<br />Will Grayson #1<br /><br />\\"I can show you the trophy case on the way out so you can bask in the achievements of the alumni who are now old enough to be suffering from erectile dysfunction, memory loss, and death.\\"<br />Will Grayson # 2<br /><br />\\"When did who you want to screw become the whole game? Since when is the person you want to screw the only person you get to love? ....People act like its [sex] the most important thing humans do, but come on. How can our sentient [expletive] lives revolve around something slugs can do?\\"<br />Will Grayson #1
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have enjoyed the series so far. The charectors are intriguing and believable in a &#34;how the upper half lives&#34; sort of way. I was disappointed at the abrupt ending.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|Clavell is a little bit or miss with his novels, but this is a grand slam. It's a story of intrigue, romance, and clashing culture. If the size of this book seems a little daunting to you (about 1000 pages), read King Rat and fall in love with Clavell's masterful ability to weave plot lines and cultures together.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|This book seems to drag.  It took a very long time to pick up anything of real interest and that was even eh.
B0015DYIH2|3.0|The last and final book in the series is much better than the last one. There is danger, suspense, and mystery. Bella starts to toughen up a little and it's a pleasure to not have to go through all the crying and whining that was the norm in the past books. I understand the idea of getting across how miserable she was but Dang! it was beginning to make me ready to slice my wrist in sympathy with her. OK, enough of that.<br /><br />The final chapter is a fitting drama to top of the series and well worth the read.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|was a nice change from other end of world movies. ill sure watch it again. really five more words? i think i said enough
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|This was an okay movie to me. I love action movies of all kinds and love Bruce Willis movies too. This one just didn't do it for me but this wont deter me from watching further movies of Bruce Willis.
B008KOTNVA|3.0|....however the steel quality is quite low, the bit heads (Philips) will deform easily without much force.<br />Get WiHa if you can afford it....
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This was a nice movie. I like Tom in movies but this one just didn't do it for me. It was action packed but not enough that kept me wanting to watch it again.
B00EUS6FR0|5.0|I've listened to the album now three times.  I'm already a huge fan of Pink Martini and this new album doesn't disappoint.  Especially love Smile with Phyllis Diller singing.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This was a good movie. I like Matthew McConaughey movies anyhow. I liked it and thought it was gripping at times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Cute game good replay value<br />Probably would have paid for it<br />The minion s are cute and hold up well
B009GXHOW4|5.0|Best app ever!!!!!  I have 50 stacks of diamonds.  I highly recomend this awesome app. INSTALL NOW!!!!!!!!!!ps: get pro version to.
B006FS22Y8|4.0|Great easy listening music, it's a shame all that talent was wasted. Well worth the money & a good price.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|A fun driving game, maybe a few more control options would take it to 5 stars. Also selling your car's should be a feature, that would be nice...
B00DU77QP2|5.0|Well writen fast paced. Characters are well constructed and believable, with some great tension building as the book progresses. I would highly recommend this series
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This is exactly what i like and this is a very good product i really appreciated. thank you very much.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|This is an awesome, change of life book for the small business owner/entrepreneur.  This book. Ends the rat race.  It ends the monotony. It provided me with a path to owning the business I want, and where people want to work.
B00338QENI|5.0|I had heard about Henrietta Lacks on the news not so long ago, so I was curious to find out more.  The book really lets you see the person, the family and the turmoil.  Where you have heard of HeLa cells before, you find out HeLa stands for HErietta Lacks.<br /><br />The story begins with the discovery the young woman makes, a tumor she can feel herself.  Being a black woman in the 40's, she was treated at the hospital that would take her, and that was Johns Hopkins.  This teaching hospital both treated Henrietta and took samples of her tumor, the latter without her knowledge or consent.<br /><br />Although Henrietta dies from the cancer, her cells live on and multiply, which is something the researchers delighted in.  Science had been trying to get cells to grow, and Henrietta's multiplied so quickly, they were of great value.<br /><br />And there lies the problem:  Someone benefitted from the sale.  Of course great discoveries were made with the HELA cells, like a vaccine for Polio, which is not a small event.  But until the 70's Henrietta's family never knew about the amazing contribution of the HeLa cells, and feel victimized.<br /><br />Thought provoking and heart breaking, this book is one to read again.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was ok.  It was our book club read.  Most felt the same.  There were some twists in it but, in the end ,I didn't care enough about any of the characters to care what happend to them.
B000ICZD4I|4.0|Tawanda!!! Kathy Bates crashing the car into the snotty nosed teenage girls car,exacting revenge for every trrampled on housewife out there, STRIKES A CHORD.  Love this tale. The only draw back initially is the jumping back and forth between time periods and story lines makes it difficult to figure out who is telling the story and what's happening.  Once that is settled you are invested in sticking it out to the end and watching what the past brought to your favorite characters.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|twentyseven songs, wow! superb video.<br /><br />Mr. Stevie Morris Wonder holds a master class on how to put a concert together.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Homeland is one of the best TV series I have watched.  It very real and keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I would highly recommend this series to everyone. Excellent acting and great story.  Can't wait for Season 3 to come out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its a pretty good app, but it wont let my kindle fire exit out of the game so I am stuck In the app till I shut down my kindle, but other than that, its very fun and time consuming.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Good songs, nice production, definitely Cher. :) I listened to the entire album (regular) then I preordered the Deluxe CD and received the physical cd on Wednesday, the day after release.<br /><br />AUTORIP INFO ---<br />I thought I'd receive the MP3 versions on my cloud player as indicate by the Autorip notation on the cd the day of release but that did not work and apparently won't be happening.<br /><br />IF YOU ORDER THIS CD and AUTORIP doesn't work contact Customer service via chat or email to let them know. I did and now have the MP3 version of the Regular CD.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I think its a very good story.  My teenage daughter is also reading the books and she loves them.  City of Glass is one of my favorite books in this series.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Spoiler beneath so please don't read if you don't want that.<br /><br />I loved the book. It was written very well. The author is very descriptive and you can clearly see all of the places that they go. The characters are full of life.  I will read this book again, but I just wish someone would have told me the hero dies in the end. I would have purchased it anyway since I already got a feel for her writing during the sample. I just would have been able to prepare myself a little better.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|If I heard about a zombie war I will never buy something relatd but in this case I did it just to see the special efects and a good acting from Brad Pitt. The story is less than absurd but you can spend a very nice and terrifying momento wille you see this movie.<br />You can tell the movie is full of action and tension like a suspense film and if you see it like just a movie you can spend as I said, a great time.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Put simply, Iron Man 3 is like a roller-coaster ride - the kind that makes you vomit. Not because all the material it presents is essentially puke-worthy, but because it hurtles through all that material way, way too fast. It whooshes its audience along at breakneck speed, slowing as it climbs a hill just long enough for us to ask \\"How the heck did we get here?\\", then plummeting down the other side before we can arrive at any answer to the question.<br /><br />The Mandarin. Killian. Tony's wormhole-related PTSD. Pepper. Extremis. After spending two-plus hours watching this movie, I felt like each of those subplots had flashed across the screen for about five seconds. And, taking a breather to analyze how they were used, I found myself decidedly unimpressed. I'm not exactly an avid reader of Iron Man comics, but I can see from some simple Wikipedia research that all these concepts lost quite a bit in translation - Extremis in particular. No longer a complex and intriguing method of producing super-soldiers, it now seems to only be capable of turning people into glowing lava monsters. The brief and boring explanation of how it works is an insult to viewers' intelligence. So are a lot of other things about the film - the final resolution in particular. Deus ex machina, anyone?<br /><br />I won't spoil the major twists here, though I wouldn't be robbing you of any great dramatic highs if I did. My main advice regarding this movie is rent, don't buy. There are some character moments and blips of humor that make it watchable. You may like it better than I did, but definitely don't expect anything along the lines of the first Iron Man, or even anything much better than the second.<br /><br />(Of course, if you want the DVD for the Agent Carter one-shot, that's a different story. I've heard it's excellent, though it didn't come with my digital rental, so I haven't seen it myself yet. If and when I do, I'll update this review with info on it.)
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If yuo like action movies and know something about Star Trek, this is a movie you must see.<br />It has a lot of action, drama and adveture and must of all, excelent special efects.<br />Maybe it is not a movie for women but if you are an action guy, you must see this movie seated at your favorite chair with a good beer and nachos.
B00846F1YW|4.0|It's a fun game and I really enjoy it, but there's a lot of simple annoyances. The text tends to move to fast, there's various grammar mistakes, and almost every time I was penalized for random taps it was  to the fact that the item was so small it was hard to get an accurate click. But even so none of these were deal breakers.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Have to use the hint tab alot. But other than that the game is pretty interesting. Just started on the game so we will see how it goes.
B004AKCME8|5.0|came here today to see if there was a sequel or something - sadly no hahaha<br />to the guy that apologized to his wife hahaha  sit back and watch more of these cgi movies, they are fun, relaxing, and very enjoyable - and I,, at 68, still into the shoot'em up, seat of the chair movies !  but these are nice, try Tin Tin next hahaha or maybe Princess Bride,(not cgi)  they are fun and you dont feel like you wasted your time.. and your kids will love you :-))
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Totally an action flick.  It seems that I kept seeing the SAME ZOMBIES over and over.  Every scene with zombies seemed to have this one particular redish haired zombie that I zeroed in on and looked for, and found again, in many scenes.  I think they cloned the zombies, maybe with computer graphics, huh?<br /><br />Not as good as that Woody Harrelson zombie movie.  I think I like Woody better than Brad.<br /><br />OK OK I came back and changed from ONE star to THREE stars because Brad Pitt is in it and the acting was better than most of these kinds of movies and because 0 of 3 people liked my review.  This was a gift to me from my son and on a boring late night one weekend we weakened and watched it.<br /><br />This town (Atlanta area) is filled with zombie lovers, what with the filming of The Walking Dead just down the road.  Zombies totally escape me and I don't understand the fascination with them; at least vampires are sexual in nature.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Definitely pickimg up the books to read the whole series. I know the second onebis to come out this november I believe.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got it as the faotd long ago and have used it nightly since that time. I like that I can mix sounds and there are always new sounds. Wonderful!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so great to play when im bored<br />It's great and never takes forever to load
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|What a shame because the graphics are beautiful, story line and character interaction good; but, the game is so very slow it's painful!  Waiting for it to load for anything and everything I could actually walk away, do some small task, and it might be ready to play again.  That is if it hasn't crashed.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I was not so sure what skill level this would be after seeing the dorky characters and the dialog but boy was I surprised. It has definitely become my favorite hidden object game. This game has allowed me hours of challenging fun and the way they have moved the objects from one level to the other really keeps you looking. The graphics are amazingly clear on my Kindle which helps find the hidden items.I am saddened to be near the end of the journey but I will for sure buy another one by this company. I would suggest a buy for sure.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Works great on my kindle.<br />I hope you work on getting candy crush, pet rescue and other games that you  have.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so much fun. To try to not slice the bombs and it is so relaxing my favorite part is the arcade  I like playing the freeze bananas it's so fun I also like the Zen mode I like playing with the lighting bolt blade hope this was help full get the game please
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I was really surprised how much I liked this movie.  The realistic look of the characters was really a cool part.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It was very good game it was awesome! It had over 20 Dragons! I loved the eggs!<br />And the game is just awesome in all ways
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a most enjoyable game for all ages. It offers immediate feedback  and helpful suggestions to attain coins or gems or to get to the next higher level. I recommend My Horse without reservation.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|App is great and easy to use. I never leave home without checking the weather. Easy to use and the pictures are beautiful.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Had previously seen this movie several times and loved it each time. The messages around individualism vs team are clearly hi-lighted. The movie also points out not only the musical talent required to be in a major college band, but the discipline, training and athleticism it takes to be successful band member.<br />It's a wonderful movie for all families to sit and watch together.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|Good  pictures and not difficult to share on e-mail with others. The photo is easy to delete if it wasn't what I wanted.
B0058UXHHK|2.0|I really wanted to like Rose. I have a soft spot for sheltered naive heroines. But Rose is an idiot. She surpasses Too Stupid To Live and ends up in Too Stupid To Function.<br />I spent most of my reading experience trying to figure out if Rose was written this way purposefully, or if the author couldn't figure out a way to advance the plot without her heroine making stupid decisions.<br />I think it was on purpose. I think we are supposed to think Rose is adorably naive.  I was willing to go with that for awhile but it is grating.  This book falls into the trap of humiliating the female characters as a form of comedy.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Perfectly cast, perfectly paced!  Tennant and Colman were brilliant together and the supporting cast were all excellent. Kept you guessing til final episode
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome trilogy. Couldn't put the books down. Sad for it to end. Can't wait for the movie. It's a must read
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This is really something extraordinary. So many wonderful characters and performances. It won't take long -- just get it and see it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|For anyone who has ever been a devoted MMORPG player, this is a must read. I could identify with just about everything in this book!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|It's always a treat when they release more from the Jimi-vault.  He just reminds me every time how he took music to another level, and no one else has attained it yet.  Definitely recommend adding this one to your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so much fun to play! I love the minons! Personally i love dave, hes a cool cat. I love how the added the different layera.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Loved all actors and the different versions of the same experience:  pregnancy.  The dads (Chris Rock, &#34;Davis,&#34; etc.) were an excellent bonus.  Delightful!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is extremely entertaining and kills time when you need to. I think everyone should get this game. Even if you didn't like the movies, try it
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|They did a great job on this game. And yes I love it.It's a great deal.<br />  It's amazing.And It's cool too.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I thought this game would be fun but it won't let me sign in don't waste your time on this game
B007AL48UK|4.0|The only complaint I have about this game is that there are certain characters that don't look the same but that are allowed as a match. And there's nothing that seems to show what these pairings are. Other than that, love the game!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|AWESOME BOOK I LOVED IT SOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH ITS UNBELIEVABLE ITS A GREAT GREAT BOOK THAT I HIGHLY DO RECOMMEND TO ANYONE
B00005MKA1|5.0|There's nothing negative I could ever say about Bob Marley! The CD is great, no complaints. I would definitely recommend it.
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|This is the only movie I have ever gone to see more than once in the theater. I went four times! It is smart, funny & romantic. I continue to watch it over and over again.
1476727651|5.0|When I started this one, I was a bit nervous about reading a sequel to THE SHINING and thought it was probably a bad idea.  I'm glad I was wrong.  As I read through the first few chapters I thought I was really in trouble because I wasn't buying the whole True Knot story or characters but as the book went along it hooked me somehow and I ended up thinking it is one of SK's best books.  Some great old characters get revisited in this one and there are some impressive new villains as well.  A pretty good surprise toward the end of the book put a cool spin on things as well.  Although I almost always enjoy a Stephen King book, I was really shocked at how much I loved this one.  Great job Stephen King!
B009682EFQ|5.0|In 2007, Neurosis took the metal world by storm by blasting back onto the scene with a long-overdue (and great through and through) return to form in said year's \\"Given To The Rising.\\" Now, flash forward five almost excruciatingly long years, and fans are finally treated to another Neurosis gem. 2012's \\"Honor Found In Decay\\" boasts all of the usual attributes that make a progressive metal album great, including intricate arrangements and multi-faceted songs that are likely to get better and reveal themselves more and more with repeat listens. Some listeners might be turned off with how heavy \\"Honor...\\" is, as it is easily one of the most brutal works of this band's career. But one thing is for certain: If they were set out to make an album that both challenges themselves and the listener (and does so equally as much), then they were certainly very successful.<br /><br />\\"We All Rage In Gold\\" kicks the album off with a super-ambient string intro followed by a punishing, powerful and propulsive brick wall of heaviness. Some mammoth, crushing sludge metal riffage and jarring power chords course throughout most of the remainder of this song, and there is a noteworthy, throbbing bass line at its center, too. Next we have \\"At The Well,\\" a track that boasts such lyrics as \\"rage will blossom,\\" which are very fitting for this tune in that it develops (or, ahem, blossoms) from a quiet, minimalistic noise to heavy territory, climaxing with towering, doom-laden riffs and dramatically marching, crashing drums. Some snarly, growled vocals are included here, as well.<br /><br />\\"My Heart For Deliverance\\" is a whopper of an epic song, and one that is mostly instrumental, boasting a very lengthy instrumental mid-song section. And the riffs, here, in this nearly twelve-minute long beast are also of note, as they gradually grow bigger and heavier, until the point where they are virtually devastating. Next up is another epically epic song in \\"Bleeding The Pigs,\\" which has some tribal-flavored percussion percolating throughout, as it does a wealth of really deft, dexterous, thumping, and exceptionally technical (yet somehow simultaneously rhythmic) drum patterns. Needless to say, \\"Bleeding...\\" does also boast some memorable guitar chops, but it is, for the most part, the drummer's show, as he fills it with a bunch of really, eminently unforgettable beats.<br /><br />Then things take a turn for the more melodic and progressive side of the line, as \\"Casting Of The Ages\\" opens with a gorgeous bit of twin-guitar acoustic strumming and hushed, delicate-sounding vocal muttering. But this is before the song takes off onto a lengthy, sustained, bludgeoning, Crowbar-worthy doom metal trek. And the final two songs, \\"All Is Found...In Time\\" and the very Sunn O)))-esque \\"Raise The Dawn\\" follow similar blueprints, incorporating some vocal variation into the mix without ever coming across as diluted or overly-experimental. With that said, though, \\"All Is Found...In Time\\" is actually mostly a standout track (one of the album's biggest) on account of  it featuring some furious, pummeling drums, and for closing with a distinctly Pink Floyd-ian, futuristic-sounding (and thus very memorable) melody.<br /><br />\\"Honor Found In Decay\\" is not quite as good or powerful as that previously mentioned 2007 release, \\"Given To The Rising.\\" Furthermore, many listeners will be a bit turned off by the record's inaccessibility and unconventionality. But once you get over yourself long enough to explore new realms with an open mind, you are in for a real treat, as this is not only a standout in Neurosis' discography, it is also one of the finest progressive metal/music releases of the new millennium.

B004UC4HCG|5.0|I have two of these, one in my studio for writing and admin use and one in my university office mostly for preparing lectures and manipulating video files for use in my lectures.  With an Intel I7-2600 (there really is no advantage to a K-type processor because the Shuttle BIOS doesn't allow overclocking) with turbo mode on, the motherboard in this box runs all four cores at 3.8GHz, which for most purposes, is quite fast.  The best thing is that while it is idling it is incredibly quiet.  I have no problem keeping it on my desktop about 18&#34; from my head while I'm working in my very quiet university office.  Even when it revs up its fan during video manipulation it isn't offensively loud.  The best thing is that it has all the connectivity you might want, and it has four DRAM connectors, room for substantially sized video card and an additional PCIe 1-channel slot.  There is room for two HDDs  and the fan enclosure makes a perfect place to Velcro in an SSD.  In my office Shuttle I have 16GB (four x 4GB) of RAM, two 2TB HDDs, and a 240GB SSD (I don't need a high speed video card and I am using the Intel graphics afforded by the 2600).  It has been a real workhorse for over a year.  Almost anyone should be able to assemble a system that provides them with the functionality they want.  Using this system you could build an I3 based computer with a 1TB HDD and 8GB DRAM for less than $500.  Update Feb 6 2016:  The one in my university office suddenly died last month.  It just would not turn on when I hit the switch.  Recent Googling suggests that this problem is relatively common in systems in use for over 3 years.  I bought a &#34;re-manufactured&#34; unit from oldegg and it was DOA.  However, the new XPC that accepts a Skylake processor is an unbelievably cool box.  Using the i7-6700K processor, a Samsung 500GB M2 card and 16GB DDR-4 RAM gives a system that performs almost twice as fast as this Shuttle under review.  I generally upgrade computers after about 3 years,anyway, and while it lasted, the SH67H3 was a great little computer.  Also, the one in my home office continues to serve me well.  In fact, I'm typing this addendum on it.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Needed another survival knife, saw it had great reviews from you tube videos, comes very sharp and is extremely durable, some might think it is a bit heavy, but that's a good thing, I have cut 2-3 inch branches from hardwood trees with ease, blade remains sharp.  Knife can take abuse, which is good if you find yourself in a &#34;sticky&#34; situation.  Sheath is durable, fits well on belt and is comfortable to wear all day.  Has great price point to get one for yourself and a buddy.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|What can you say.  Nip/Tuck was one of the finest series ever presented on television.  This last season concludes an excellent run.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Lets just say it is a pretty big secret and the characters and the story line are great.  It was a definite page-Turner.  The book could be compared to a Jodi Piccoult novel.  Would love to read other books by this author.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Pinocchio is funny but presents lessons about telling the truth at all costs. If children see this funny but serious movie, then they will be apt to practice great ethical skills.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The book was very picturesque and lovely. It took me back to a time before I was born. I enjoyed reading it. It is naive, a children's book.
B0001I561E|5.0|Aladdin has always been a great movie for anyone to watch. It depicts the honor of doing the right things even when you stand alone. Princess Jasmine is the absolute best in that she appears to stand up to her overbearing father who only wants what he wants for her, and ignores his daughters' desires. A great lesson comes from this funny cartoon

Joss Whedon had got 4 great legendary heroes of Marvel, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Thor & Captain America to unite as 1 to save the world. Marvel has made a giant leap in cinematic history of all time, assembling a movie this big & diversed has never been done before. Every moment of this has made a global phenomenon but Marvel is good now But DC Comics will be greater & always has been. The Avengers is the 1st step but The Justice League will be the ultimate step of all times to come

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|After listening to this CD several times, I have heard the previous four albums of Dream Theater and after ADTOE this is by far the album that I like more. I think it's a cd very consistent. I like all the songs. I will not make a review song to song but highlight what I liked most. To start any of the songs is a ballad in the style of FAR FROM HEAVEN or BENEATH THE SURFACE. What I mean is that the more melodic songs from this album also have their moments of good hard guitars and drums. And what most impressed me is orchestral part of ILLUMINATION  THEORY. At home, my five year old son every night for a long time told me he wanted to hear the song of war.For him, the song of war is the opening theme of THE PACIFIC and I think this song is a work of art. Well, this orquetral part is very similar  and equally exciting. The whole song is wonderful.A great album, heavy and melodic at the same time. Very good
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read this book because it was the September selection for my book club.  I am not normally drawn to biographies so I don't think I would have read this book had it not been a selection for book club.  This is one of the biggest reasons I enjoy being in a book club.  I read books I might not otherwise have read.  I absolutely loved this book.  I loved the subject matter.  Steve Jobs is a modern day Da Vinci.  He may even be greater.  He changed the world.  Hundreds of years from now he will be remembered as the pathfinder and visionary he was.  I loved the way the book was written.  I will read other books by this author.  I could not put this book down.  I learned so much about computers.  I was raised a PC gal.  I gradually embraced Apple.  My first apple products were the Macbook Pros I bought for my children when they went off to college in 2007 and 2008.  Then I bought one.  I found it easy to use once I let go my fear of change.  then I bought the I Phones for the kids and then me.  Then I got a free I Pad mini when I went solar.  I am on my dream vacation/experience right now.  I am living in Paris for three months.  My laptop, i-phone and i-pad mini are with me.  Yes, I could just use one, but I am still learning and leaning on all three.  When I get back state side I will buy a Mac for my desk top!  I laugh when I hear &#34;once you go Mac, you don't go back!&#34;  This is my experience.  Reading this book confirmed my experience.  And I learned even more about operating systems and the closed vs open debate still going between Apple and Microsoft.  Sorry Bill, I am on the Apple closed approach for now.  I feel that is why I don't get viruses like I have gotten with Microsoft . But the book offered more.  I got to see a visionary at work.  I love the way Jobs created.  I know he was difficult and demanding and a wee bit eccentric.  But that was part of the whole package.  He displayed a laser like focus when he created his products.  And he kept the futureof these products in the hands of those who created them and not the &#34;salesmen.&#34;  Yes, Steve Jobs was remarkable and this book captured my interest like no other in a long while.  I saw the movie here in Paris.  I liked it.  I think Ashton Kutcher did a great job.  But Jobs was bigger than this.  The movie only covered his first apple computer and the Mac.  There was no mention of the i-Pad or the &#34;1000 songs in your pocket,&#34; the I Phone.  Any one of thee products would have guaranteed Jobs a well deserved place in history.  But all of them?  well, he is the ultimate &#34;hall of famer&#34; in the digital-communication age in my book.  I think this book should be required reading for anyone who wants to manifest his or her dreams.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I'm not going to dig into the meaning of this book or what the author tries to pass to us. What I will comment on is that about 15 years ago, I was assigned to read this book for school. It was the first book that I literally didn't get bored with in the early chapters and actually wanted to continue reading. It was the first book that I willingly finished reading on my own decision. This book engraved itself into my memories and after this many years, I decided to finally read it a second time. It read a lot easier now than back then but the impact (even the impact of the details that I remembered) was just as significant and meaningful as the first time I read it those many years ago.
B00BESM14U|5.0|Movies are rarely able to capture the actual theme of the book-- characters, yes; plot, mostly; but theme, hardly ever. This one was different. Awesome actors.<br /><br />I would never recommend this book or movie to an adolescent. I don't think we should experiment with drugs and sexuality during high school. This is an excellent story for those of us who are growed-up and have forgotten the confusion and excitement of adolescence.
1401235417|5.0|I am a person who likes to read things as they slowly develop and I like when things get into detail when it comes to emotion and character development. All these things that I mentioned are in this book, it has its moments where you really think to yourself \\"wow this is really a good story\\", but even though this is an amazing story it does have its flaws at parts where the pacing might be off in a bit but overall the whole story itself is what makes this whole comic book shine. The story for it is really fitting and the unique art  really goes well with it. You won't go wrong if you buy this comic, trust me.
B007QUUJMG|5.0|I loved this book when I came across it in a graduate school class about young adult literature. It is refreshing to hear about life from the perspective of an introvert.<br /><br />However, it is not a book that I would recommend to most young adults because experimentation with drugs and sex are treated as common place when they are really destructive and can have life long consequences.

B007REV4YI|5.0|Everything has already been said here, technical or otherwise. The movie is a bit slower than most recent Bond films, but that is because there is a deeper story to follow this time. I enjoyed this film, and was sad to see Dame Judi Dench ride off into the sunset -- one of the very few films where I actually teared up while watching - she is the true &#34;Bond Girl&#34; of this movie.<br /><br />Awesome direction, sound and cinematography. If you have enjoyed Bond in the past, get this movie. Don't even think about it - $15 nets you the Blu-ray, digital copy for your computers, and DVD for the car or secondary television. You will not find a better deal.

B00CTSDDVO|4.0|Some background: I first started watching Star Trek back when \\"The Next Generation\\" premiered - and fell for the amazing stories.  I liked the special effects, marveled at how frequently they would sneak something controversial by the censors, but most of all I loved by the IDEA of \\"Star Trek\\".  If you are a fan of the show, you know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />Since then, I have watched and enjoyed every other incarnation of Trek.  Even Voyager and Enterprise.<br /><br />So...did the JJ reboot in 2009 bother me? Not really.  I realized it for what it was - a studio trying to 'reboot' a franchise to make it appeal to a new generation of movie buffs - the ones who grew up with iPad's in their hands and televisions in every room.  The ones who openly...deride...Shatner's...signature...delivery...of his lines.<br /><br />This movie is a fun, action packed romp from beginning to end.  It takes the normally upstanding Starfleet and turns it on its head - showing it as an organization that is corrupt, decedent and prone to the human failings that are familiar to audiences in 2013.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cerebral story, go elsewhere.<br /><br />If you like beautiful women, explosions, lens flare, and action, check this out.<br /><br />My other thoughts:<br /><br />- Spock stealing the \\"KHAAAAAAN!!\\" line seemed very forced, but I cackled with glee anyway.  Admit it -- you did too.<br /><br />- Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan steals the show.<br /><br />- Alice Eve is GORGEOUS.<br /><br />- Kirk really should not be running a ship.  The Enterprise seems to almost get destroyed every 15 minutes.<br /><br />Check this out, you will not regret it...if you come into this with an open mind.
B000093FLA|5.0|The DVD arrived on time appropriately packed.<br />Snatch is one of the greatest movie's ever (ranked #110 in the top 250 on IMDB). The acting is flawless, the writing is hilarious, the story line complex but not confusing and the ending is just great.<br />If you like movies with funny accents, dodgy characters and a bunch of swear words, than this is for you.<br />If you like Pulp Fiction, you'll like Snatch.
B008CP2E7C|5.0|I ordered the Searching for Sugar-man from Amazon because I like documentaries and this one sounded good.  Not only was it good, it was oustanding!!! I watched it over and over. Then I ordered the two music CD's that Rodriquez made and I do honestly listen to them everyday.  I think his music is the best not only of our era (the '60's and '70's) but still the best today.  I would love to see him do a show here in the states and no matter where it is held, I would fly there to go see him.  I wish there was a sight where I could write to him and also to \\"Sugar\\" to let them know how much I am enjoying them.
B000093BDX|5.0|Love the Beach Boys and their music. What more can I say? This CD has a good variety of their songs and ti is a joy to listen to their music.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|I'll be the first to admit that I would like no better than Elton John to return to the days of Captain Fantastic and earlier.  But, I also realize that his voice is nowhere near what it used to be.  With that said, Elton has delivered an album here suited for his current voice.  Nope, you won't find any rockers on here although that's what I would like.  Instead you'll find a very somber album, piano, bass and drum being the emphasis.  Electric guitar, none likely.  This album for alot of fans might be a turn off, but Elton does indeed deliver a solid album here.  He's not writing for the public, he's making music for him and the chips fall where they fall on who likes it or doesn't.  At this point, I think he's gotten beyond the critics and what they like or don't like.  Good for him.  Just realize that if you purchase this album that it will be the far end of the extreme compared to 'Saturday Night's Alright for Fightin'.  But, if you want a mellow album then this is it with outstanding lyrics from Bernie Taupin.  I've listened to Elton since his first album, 'Empty Sky' and do I miss those early years?  Absolutely.  But, time marches on and it is what it is as far as Elton and the type of music that he chooses to make these days.  But I will disagree with a comment made by someone on another's review that Elton is making this somber music based on his older audience.  Well, I'm older and I still want to rock out and if that were true then the group Rush should be making old tunes also.  But, they're not.  Rush wishes to put out music of their choosing and with Elton and 'The Diving Board' he's doing the same.<br /><br />On a side note one thing I will say as much as I gave this five stars for what this album is and I think it's well done, many reviewer's are giving this one star based on the somber mood, no guitar and the vocal quality of Elton's voice these days.  In part I can agree and will say that I would have loved to see a more uplifting album which he could have easily done here.  Take for example: Julian Lennon's release from 2011 'Everything Changes'.  While this is a somber and introspective album he totally delivers throughout and something that maybe Elton John could have pursued doing with this current release.  But, I don't write the music so in the end it's always the artists decision on the direction they so choose.uld have easily done here.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I am happy to report that my grandkids love the wireless controller. I now have 4 controllers at home so they can all play and not argue about sharing. Since I don't use the PlayStation, I asked the &#34;kids&#34; why they like it and they said because it is wireless.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is about ex CIA, ex MI6, ex KGB, banned together to fight the system who is trying to kill them. Packed with all star cast, you will not be disappointed, that is I hope not. It is action packed and quite comical in some scenes. Looking to get RED 2.
B0040GSVH4|5.0|And who doesn't love Amazon Cloud Player and MP3 store...screw you iTunes. And Amazon with a Sonos system streaming music through the whole house, forget about it. Awesome!! Keep Calm and Chive On.
B005544V6A|5.0|I 100% recommend watching it.  I'm only a couple episodes in, but I am going to have to dedicated a night to watch the series in whole.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|I am a trekkie so it is really a classic that I could watch over over.  It is definitely not disappointing,
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I like/love this thing - I attached it to my bedroom TV and now I stream NetFlix when I want to stay warm in bed. This has no combersome equipment to install or use up space and it comes to my flat screen TV clear as can be...beautiful picture. I gave it a 4 star rating because I just wish this would work with my Amazon video library...that would make it even better!!!!
B00DBR8A60|1.0|I received this watch and the seller didnt offer exchange, only refund. the wrist band is for a 7 year old kid (on a watch for an older person) horrible
B00ESB6GBY|4.0|Funny, with a great cast of characters - I hope Barney starts another show! But for now I will warm up and see this last season through :(
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|buying this little baby! It is great and essentially allows you to do everything you could with a roku, but not needing to buy one.<br /><br />If you are looking to choose btw this and an apple tv/roku, just get this. price is better and functionality is awesome.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Good, old fashioned exciting movie. It starts out where everyone is oohing and awing the development of Jurassic Park with the many varieties of dinosaurs. Then the security and electrical system of the Park is tampered with and all hell breaks loose. After that happens, there's a lot of running and screaming. Good acting, beautiful scenery, and a lot of scary excitement.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I liked this game a lot when I first got it, but now there have been updates that have added ADS on this, when I change screens a commercial pops up and I do not like it at all.  Get rid of the ads, there are no need for them.  I skip it after a few seconds but do not want to have to see them at all.
B0009P42S2|5.0|This was cool anime.  It took me a while to get into it but I was patient and greatly rewarded at the end.  Well done.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I loved this story! I needed a story like this after reading The Sword of Truth Series. There are several mini stories in the book, but once you get towards the end you start to realize how it comes together. I wish it didn't end! Now I can't wait for the next one.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|You can spend more (a LOT more) and you can get better.  But I seriously doubt you can get more bag for less.  I was careful at first but now I carry my whole kit in this bag.  (Two DSLR's and up to 4 lenses) and just go with it.  It's a winner.
0060989157|5.0|I have only read a few chapters of this book  and already, I am hooked. This book is cleaver, funny, sad, intense, erotic and insane. I'm glad I was able to purchase it through amazon books because I have had problems trying to find it else where.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Yet another book that I didn't want to end. Brandon is a master at crafting stories that hook and introducing new people to like. Quirky characters that remind you of people you know or people you'd like to know. Do yourself a favor and take the literary ride that is Steelheart.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I hate to be jumping on the bandwagon that is this show, but it really is perhaps the best show that has ever been made.  There have been so many shows that have had lulls in the middle, or have created muddled story threads, and with the exception of one plot point in between Seasons three and four, this show has been the most consistent and engaging that I have ever seen.  As much as I liked the first season, this was really the one that brought me into the show.  The relationship between Jesse and Walt during this season is completely amazing, I have to say that Tuco is probably not the best foil in the world, but he still provides plenty of great moments for the show, culminating in the great hostage scene with the man with the bell.  This show really gets all the details right with a great mixture of tense suspense, and satirical humor.  The best part of this show is Jesse's new girlfriend who almost tears him away from Walt, despite the two really needing one another to get out of the mess they get themselves into.  A very tight season with very little fluff.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Watch this only if you are a big fan of Guns and explosions, as that is the only thing in this film. The plot is weak, but they seemed to have every living action hero in this movie!
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I have to say that at first listen I was a little disappointed at this album.  The one thing that I can say about A7X is that they always manage to reinvent themselves on each album for better or worse.  I personally think they peaked with City of Evil, but I know just about every album has a very loyal fanbase, but this one seems a bit stagnant of what came before.  To a lot of fans of the band, this album is mostly known as the first album that came out after the death of drummer \\"The Rev\\".  It sounds in many ways as if the band might have rushed bringing this album out as a means of grieving, and I'm not sure if it was done in the best sense of the term, as many of the arrangements don't feel finished.  The one thing that really does stand out about this album is the writing.  There are a few reviewers that have also commented about the theme of death and loss that permeates the album, despite claims from the band to the contrary.<br /><br />The singles from the album almost represent the more formulaic parts of the band.  The other real stand out is the Portnoy drum tracks, though this isn't to say that they are better than the Rev's, but merely that the rest of the band doesn't seem to have their heart into it.  He is a fantastic drummer and he does lay down some great solos, though they do seem a bit out of place for the band.  The album also includes a demo of the last song the Rev ever did, with him on vocals.  It is not polished like the rest of the album, but it is a touching tribute.  It just feels like there could have been a bit more built around it.
B001V7UXG2|3.0|when i first heard about this series on pbs, i was very excited. i was a huge hugh laurie and p.g. wodehouse fan already and he was the absolute perfect actor to play bertie wooster. maybe the most perfect actor for a role ever. stephen fry was also an excellent choice for jeeves. and the jeeves and wooster stories were wodehouse's best (along with the mr. mulliner and stanley ukridge stories). so this series was a huge disappointment. laurie and (to a lesser degree) fry were all that i expected but the screenwriting adaptions were excruciatingly abysmal....the talentless hacks who adapted the stories were matched with truly clueless, horrible direction along with terrible casting and inept, talentless supporting actors. what should have been a great series was an awful mess. unlike the excellent pbs sherlock holmes series with jeremy brett, the authors stories were ruthlessly cut, altered and merged with no respect for wodehouse's writing and with no competence whatsoever. the multi talented laurie manages to heroically make this unpalatable mess watchable just on his own merits. there is another pbs series called \\"wodehouse playhouse\\" which does an infinitely better job of adapting mainly wodehouse's mulliner and ukridge stories with just 2 lead actors. very well directed and written, it is a joy to watch and very good.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I will never forget when this album hit.  After the mid nineties, and even the great Pantera had fallen in popularity, there were a lot of pushes to get metal going again.  There was a good serge of Nu Metal, which I was never a fan of, that lead into the metalcore seen of the early 2000's.  While I do love some of those acts, most never really caught on with mainstream audiences.  A7X was one of those bands.  At that time, I hadn't really seen the genius of Waking the Fallen, and it seemed like an screamo band that was more interested in their female fans that actually making a metal album (It has taken time to appreciate the complex Maiden with punk influence structure of that album) but this one really broke open metal to the masses.  This is the best A7X album, and while they have only gotten bigger since this album's release, this is the one that they will be remembered for until and if they can top it.<br /><br />There are a lot of criticisms that this album is too much of a departure from their previous albums, which may be somewhat true, but I will say that it is for good reasons.  I have heard a lot of emo and AFI comparisons for this album and how the band isn't metal, and while I might agree with their subsequent self titled album being more rock, the guitar parts on here alone qualify this as a very technical metal album, just one that the uninitiated can listen to and appreciate.  I understand that to the purists that this almost seems like sacrament, but that type of thinking alienates the rest of society.  I know that it is a hard thing to do, to look inward at the community that we love and to realize that while integrity and all the great things that metal stands for, being completely alone isn't one of them.  There was a time when this whole country loved metal and had integrity.  Making music that only a few people understand isn't helping anyone.  Trying to say that one thing qualifies as metal because of how hard core it is reduces music to numbers and not how it makes you feel, and A7X managed to make a metal album that was fun.  This is what brought guitar parts back into metal beyond just double base drums and base guitar.  I have heard the criticism that Shadow's voice sounds a little whiney here, but not any more so than old GNR.  This is the album that most kids today see as metal, and I don't think that is a bad thing.  For an old timer that has been listening to the genre for his whole life, it is really cool to have things chaged up from time to time.ers and not how it makes you feel, and A7X managed to make a metal album that was fun.

B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|read the reviews... had to try the game... tried the game... love it... the reviews are real and great...!! worth the money!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Most of what the author tells the reader represents the consensus of historical scholarship on the historical Jesus.  It's not new.  However his reconstruction of the life of Jesus of Nazareth is more imaginative than critical.  For example compare the work of Dominic Crossan who starts with roughly the same historical facts and constructs a different version of the life of Jesus.<br /><br />My question is: Granted that Paul of Tarsus was not interested in the historical facts of Jesus' life, why is it that having become a follower of Jesus 5 years after his death, Paul seems to have no notion that Jesus was a Zealot?  Did the followers of Jesus forget who he was?  Did they fail to communicate with Paul in 37 AD that Jesus was the kind of person Mr. Aslan reconstructs in his popular readable new myth that appeals to a secular intellectual audience?
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Can't stream HBO and numerous other video platforms.  Maybe once it gets upgraded a few times I will try it again.  Until then - it will remain shoved in a drawer with other useless gadgets.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|DT continues making a unique kind of music, breaking barriers, redefining boundaries. Progressive rock fans should be very pleased with the direction the band has taken since Portnoy's departure. The music is bolder, more progressive, more experimental... yet all instruments are as tight as it gets and the sound is pretty heavy. I'm personally loving the end result. Mangini's drums are uber-impressive. JP once again proves he's one of the most proficient rock guitarists ever. All band members are in top form. Songs are fantastic. The most unusual aspect of the album is the strings section in Illumination Theory. When it starts, I don't want it to end.<br /><br />In the last 15 years, I've never waited for an upcoming album so enthusiastically. Yet Dream Theater totally delivers! Thank you for all the joy, guys!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Have never opened the game because it crashes before it opens. Probably has to do with the instant links to stuff they're selling. Too bad. Thought it might be fun.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have read all of the Skokie Stackhouse series and love it.  Gonna miss her she became a friend thru all these books.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had never read a novel by David Baldacci before, but was very impressed with this one.  The story of a US government paid assassin that is forced to solve and clean up an international mess created partially by himself, The Innocent, runs at a lightning pace from beginning to end.  With good character development, nice use of emotion, and detail that comes from great research, The Innocent is an outstanding read.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Fun, easy game, requiring no major brain power. Just what I need to help cancel out a stressful day at work.
B0020BUWX2|2.0|The reviews for this book were great, but I was very disappointed.  I kept waiting for something to happen to pull me in but it never did.  The picture perfect life painted pre-accident was not believable, the too cool parents and the ultra amazing yet deep boyfriend, the whacky little brother and grandpartents that just \\"get it\\".  The characters were dull while trying to be hip.  I found myself speed reading through it just so it would be over faster and I could move on to something else.  Some may enjoy this, but it was not for me.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I love  this app. I am able  to personalize all my picture. Im very glad i upgraded to this app.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I love ZZ Top and I really love this boxset.  Rick Rubin should have never touched the classic ZZ Top recordings with a lame digital reverb.  All is in it's right place with this Box Set.  No digital reverb and pure ZZ Top tone.  I love it!
B002ZTIIXK|5.0|K.D. Lang fans ~ get this one ! Great compilation of her best ! Enjoy her voice  very much !
B001VB8UAE|5.0|This is an all time great and I loved the dvd concert and I felt as though I am there at concert so wonderful. And the product had arrived in very good condition. Sometimes the postal service damages items whileut  in transient,nothing new,but thione made it ok.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|One of the best keyboard and Android apps I have ever used. I highly recommend anyone tired of the everyday, standard keyboard.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|best book ive read in a while<br />finished reading within a few hours because i couldnt put it down :)
B00CKR63F2|4.0|First of all, I'm giving this book 4 out of 5 stars because some of the spelling and grammar errors distracted me enough to take me out of the moment in the story.<br /><br />This book is a diamond in the rough. The research and use of real places and historical references to bring it to life are wonderful and the story itself is excellent. There are some places where it drags on a bit and overall this story is written for a younger reader (pre-teen, teen) than I, but I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />I really liked the nuggets of wisdom sprinkled throughout the book such as:<br /><br />\\"Someone you trust will test and maybe betray the new found confidences you have given them. Beware of the dark one. All is not as it seems and there will be traps that you cannot let defeat you. You may also feel alone at times. You need to know that you will never be alone. Do not fear these things; you cannot let fear choose your destiny.\\" pg. 171<br /><br />\\"My dear child you need to be strong enough to stand alone. Be smart enough to know when you need help. Be brave enough to ask for it.\\" pg. 209<br /><br />\\"There is always pain in love. Wherever you go love is like war. It is easy to begin, but hard to stop.\\" p. 197<br /><br />I love it when sentences in a book seem to jump out at me like that. This book is part of a series and I liked the ending and was left curious enough to read the next book. I think you'll enjoy it too.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I liked this book as much as \\"Gone Girl.\\" I didn't think the author could top that one. I could not wait to get back to \\"Sharp Objects\\" between breaks.Very good author. Interesting characters and intriguing plot. Both books grab you and pull you in.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I wish I had read this earlier, before uploading books. I used what it taught me in my new book, \\"What On Earth Is Going On Spiritually Speaking,\\" and found it so helpful, producing a much better product than just uploading a Word document. So, I went back and re-did my \\"The Key, Forgiveness and Beyond\\" according to the book suggestions and am going to re-do the other books I've uploaded too. I think everyone who wants to put an ebook up needs to read this.
0744014956|3.0|So the thing any reasonable non-five-star review will mention is there's practically nothing about how to make money in the game's stock market in this guide.  I'm sure it's a reason a lot of people buy this guide to begin with.  Obviously in the game, a character explicitly tells you how to manipulate the stock market before certain missions, but this requires you to take his advice in the cutscene and then cancel the mission before you can invest.  It would be convenient to have a text to refer to (like, say, a *strategy* guide) before beginning a mission in the first place.<br /><br />The vehicle guide lists the four stats for every game in the vehicle, which is awesome.  But on several pages \\"Acceleration\\" and \\"Braking\\" are reversed.  Anybody with a brain would be able to spot this and disregard it, but there are obviously people rating this who are very annoyed by it.  In previous guide books (notably the San Andreas guide for Xbox/PS2) there have been descriptions of where to find or how to ascertain certain cars.  That isn't really apparent here, aside from a mention of where certain rare cars can be purchased on the game's internet app. I'd consider this just enough to knock a star off my rating. It's kind of odd.  Not to mention there are typos and other instances where descriptions, photos, and items on a map are jumbled.  This can make finding certain things or triggering certain missions confusing.  In a game where seeking out so many items and missions is so important, an official guide should be edited and proofread a lot better.<br /><br />The actual layout of the book bothers me.  It's just not intuitive to have certain maps printed so small or lists of items arranged alphabetically.  I can't explain this efficiently enough, but a perfect example would be that the first three stunt jumps as listed in the book are on opposite sides of them map.  If you wanted to hop on a bike and go do all the stunt jumps in order, following along with this book will have you driving to opposite ends of the map as opposed to doing one, then doing the one nearby, etc etc etc until you found them all.  I don't know if this applies to letter scraps, hidden packages, or space ship parts (I haven't started those yet), but I do know this is the case for stunt jumps and random events.  Of course you can do these in any order and just cross them off as you go, but a good guide would list the most efficient ways to find these items.  Also, some items are color coded while listed and dotted on a map (armor vs weapons) but when you flip the page to detailed descriptions, they're all labeled with the same color, which I found inconsistent.<br /><br />As a few people have mentioned, the actual mission guide is not very detailed.  The book tells you little more than the general outline of things that occur in the game.  This sort of defeats the point of a 400+ page strategy guide. But people who are giving this only one star are ridiculous. It's very nice, and thorough as far as listing what the game has to offer, and obviously a lot went into organizing the information for all the games side quests and objectives.<br /><br />All I can say I got from this book was car stats at glance (which can probably be found online now), weapons/armor/hidden items maps (also probably online), and some great detail about how to the actual mathematical breakdown of how to increase stats (probably online by now, though most likely plagiarized from this very book).have you driving to opposite ends of the map as opposed to doing one, then doing the one nearby, etc etc etc until you found them all.

B00594XOZU|5.0|I have been using this app almost FOREVER but it kept bugging me about the review so here it is.....I LOVE THIS APP 2 thumbs up ^_^
B00004VXF2|5.0|I don't care if it's ironic<br />I don't care if it's noise<br />I don't care if it's old<br />if it's bad<br />if it's artistic<br />if it's a big middle finger to the music industry...<br /><br />This is a fantastic record that was 40 years ahead of its time that went on to influence generations of alternative musicians.<br /><br />Punk rock, as you know it, would not exist<br />Grunge would not exist.<br />Industrial music would be less less abrasive<br />And we'd all be a little worse off<br /><br />If you're the type of person who views music as something that needs a 4/4 beat with a verse, chorus, verse, chorus, breakdown/solo/refrain, chorus format for it to be successful, you will hate this album because it will sound like unmitigated noise to you.<br /><br />As a person who's played an instrument since he was 4, I can't escape the textures.  No matter the cacophony, no matter the discord; I cannot look away.  The only time it truly hurts for me to listen is when it finally stops.<br /><br />In 1975, this album cost a man his credibility in the record industry.  35 years later, he's toured based on it's inspiration and re-released it because there was a crowd that finally \\"got\\" it.  We just needed to live through 35 years of technology embracing and interfering with every aspect of our lives for it to finally make sense.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love sol. Played forever since I was a little girl, and would watch my mother play for hours. Great game, great childhood memories.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|So addictive, can't get through my day without it!!!!  If you want to be entertained this is definitely the game for you.
B00BX8PG4S|3.0|watch it,  pass it forward, Some big names. Would not buy one, but did not find a copy with other veterans.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Big buttons, simple interface.  Just what I was looking for in a calculator ap.  If you want a basic calculator this is it.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|It downloaded just great.<br />I entered all of the correct information 3 times but it would not let me go forward from that point to open the the program. I will try it later to see if it will allow me to do something at that point.
B00D8HNR5W|4.0|The latest from Nine Inch Nails is an interesting mix of atmospheric, nearly instrumental music similar to The Fragile and harder rocking songs similar to With Teeth. While maybe not as good as their older albums or Year Zero, this is still a solid album.  It really starts off with a bang with &#34;Copy of a&#34; and &#34;Came Back Haunted.&#34; The newest single, &#34;Everything,&#34; is also pretty good.  The rest of the album is decent - not classic NIN, but also not bad.  Most of the album will be very interesting to see performed live.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Some levels drove me crazy but I kept going back .Fun and sometimes very intense. Addicting !!!Great game of skill and precision !!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Awesome show, I can't understand how I missed out on it when it first aired.  Can't wait to watch the rest of the episodes.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It held my attention and I liked the fact that you find out the secret early on. The family dynamics and characters were interesting and well developed. The plot was well written.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|My daughter really loves to play/learn with this app. It is also helping me remember all the Spanish that I learned in high school and college. Try and you will love it!
B008EKMB82|5.0|Delightful adventure . Captivating. Engrossing. Wonderful characters. Read it! You won't regret it. Surprising and fresh. I lived this book
B00BQ4NLC8|5.0|This is a fascinating book with many stories being told at the same time and also many characters who at some point become important to link everything.  Intense, unusual and beautifully written.  I am definitely going to look for other titles from this author.
0062200399|4.0|Very well created edition. The quality of the paper is outstanding, and every part of it, form the cover to the letter type and size, it gives the impression, that this is not a standard book. Since originally this is a graphic novel, without the original full illustrations of Charles Vess, you miss a huge part of the feeling reading this story, but it is a wonderful gift to some, who has the old original edition, and loves the story and admires good quality beautiful books.<br />I hope I can see the fully illustrated version in the same quality soon.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Plenty of action! This sci-fi of the future is very graphic, and is full of detail. Well directed, and cast. There are many twists and turns to keep you captivate through out the movies.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|i absolutely loved it.  hope there are many more to come.  robert downey jr. is excellent.  i am looking forward to seeing more of these thoroughly entertaining movies.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wonderful ending, loved the whole story of Peeta and Katniss and how against all odds they ended up together, and in love.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is easy to advance and earn those special gems unlike some games out in the market.
B00594XOZU|4.0|The app is  super cool but I can't log in to my account I tried like 5 times please try to get it fixed
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love puzzles and this has some very nice ones. The thing that kept me from giving it that fifth star is the fact that sometimes it glitches and the pieces turn into white rectangles. I just close it out and restart it until the pieces are back. Sometimes it takes several tries.
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|As much as I love this movie, as have already seen it, I wanted to own it. So I came across the Blu-ray version of it, because I figured it'd be the best picture. However, when I try to play it on my laptop, or even my Blu-ray player at home, it won't register. It constantly says No-disc on my Blu-ray player. When I play it on my laptop, all I get is audio and a green screen. One star for this issue. Will update if issue gets resolved.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I love the game. It is great fun but... on numerous occasions the game has started on its own!!! I am deleating it!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Thanks. Came very quickly, exactly as ordered. Very haappy that both CDs ordered came in the same order package in great condition.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game ever! Amazing graphics! I constantly play this game! Love all the different horses and tack you can change around
B0043J08C4|5.0|Yes I would recommend this movie to friends and family to watch. The sound effects and make up work was very life like and believable to the seeing eye.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love it! Great book. The Secret in a fun applicable way. A repeat of all that is true. Quick read. Fun to do experiments. And I'm only two thirds through.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|amazingly simple and easy to use. everyone should have this app in their collection And its streamer client installed on every pc or tablet and phone they own
0893860220|5.0|Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj is love and unity and Absolute Reality.  I am grateful.  I have been initiated by several loving gurus--Maharishi and Deepak--and peace is Nisarga yoga.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great game. I enjoy playing the game for long periods of time. Have recommended to others for downloading and playing.
B00BESCJII|3.0|It's not exactly a feel good movie, so if that's what you're looking for I don't suggest watching it. If you're looking for a high school drug, alcohol, and drama fest go for it.
B005V5WBFG|5.0|This works well for my tablet . the setup is very easy. it makes me feel secure that i can subscribe to this website.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|It's the musical for today's day and age. It's pretty cheesy, and they have some gross out scenes that I think were completely unnecessary. This movie wasn't made to be taken seriously. It was made to laugh and have fun. In that respect they succeeded. If you like people breaking out into song, I say give it a go.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Gripping season.  I'm changing my mind about Thomas and Mary is on my list of favorite people.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love it! I have  no complaints. It's fast, very understandable an  almost always accurate. I have  never had a problem with this app on the kindle, ipads and the phones. I am very satisfied with this app.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|It's been pleasure to read this book. I finished with smile on my lips and melancholy in my heart. The author is naturally talking about things that others hide or talk crudely about. As always, I felt connected to the story, devouring each thought as if it was mine. I don't think you can go wrong with any of Paulos' books. This one will remind you to go free and open your heart. You won't regret reading it!
B004CLYKLI|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who is a parent.<br /><br />I can't believe all the negative reviews, how dare you people?????<br /><br />You make the author sound like she abused her kids and tortured them instead of standing over them while they practiced their musical instruments and achieved great success.  The problem with our society today is that everyone wants to be friends instead of parents.  That's a wrong approach to parenting. Yes, sometimes  kids that were raised without  discipline come out okay, but majority of the time parents that set boundaries and have rules and consequences have much better results.<br /><br />It is our job as parents to teach them to set and achieve goals, reminding them that hard work, focus and determination gets you where you want to go.<br />THIS IS HOW CONFIDENCE IS BUILT.
0763644765|5.0|My neice was just getting started with potty training.  Her grandmother (my sis) purchased a pink potty and I purchased the book.  What a great idea!  Highly successful!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game with easy to navigate screens bit tricky on 7\\" screen but very addictive<br />Wood recommend to any age above 8 give it a try
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This is a very entertaining series.  It does leave one wondering why people in or around their mid-twenties are chosen to play the roles of 16 year olds, though.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|This was a great Sci-Fi fantasy TV series.  It's a shame it didn't last longer but seeing it now shows how some of the show's cast went on to much bigger and better opportunities and some are wearing &#34;Suits&#34;!
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I thought it was good video quality and no problems streaming. I would definitely use this again in the future.
B0014KA0EG|5.0|The best band of the 90's playing their best album. Top to bottom this is easily the #1 Rock album of the decade. The vocals and guitar are the best of their generation. Don't go and buy single songs like &#34;Them Bones&#34; or &#34;Would?&#34; Listen to one of the 5 greatest Rock albums of all-time in it's entirety.
B002O2THRO|4.0|The characters and relationships are the strength of this film.  The people and their interactions are realistic and believable, but the depiction of the frenzied jazz age lacks energy.  If I could combine the qualities of this and the 2013 Gatsby, the result would be both the heart and soul of Fitzgerald's great novel.
B00138J9FU|5.0|I know &#34;Living After Midnight&#34; has been played, however this is an album you can listen to from first song to last and say every song is as good or better than &#34;Midnight&#34;. I put this album on my mp3 player and the entire song-list still holds up in 2013. If you're young and want to discover older Priest, start here then move on to Point of Entry, also a great album.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I love this movie and have since the first time I saw it.  It is placed in a time in our history when elegance was a life style.  It's so pretty.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is good for the mind, it makes you think & concentrate looking for items, I also find it good for my eyes too, it exercises them.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have always loved Stephen King's books and have read them since I was a teenager, all except for the Gunslinger series which I could not get into. I loved this book but I have one big problem:<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />He never tells whether or not the baseball boy's family was notified about where he ended up. I hate to think of those poor people never finding out what happened to their kid. I know these are fictional characters, but I am the type that really gets into what I am reading.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Great accessory for the GoPro.<br />It drains the battery a lot quicker, but I knew that before buying so it's all good.<br /><br />It really helped me stabilize the views prior to recording.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing, I've read the entire trilogy twice, and I've enjoyed it both times. Christian Grey is a highly emotional character that is as intense as the topic itself. There is so much more than meets the eye to his initial arrogant and dominating personality. I think that his growth process is phenomenal. Throughout the entire series, he shows he is capable of falling in love and fighting his demons to feel happiness. It is simply spectacular.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very well done period drama but can it ever make you cry. Just when you think there is some happiness then comes the tears.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Though I was initially a little upset with the ties that were left loose in \\"Entwined With You\\", I do not regret reading it. Sylvia Day takes you through a slow and growing romance that isn't rushed and is taken day by day. I think that the quality of \\"The Crossfire Series\\" is thorough, and so long as that is the case, I do not mind waiting for the rest of the books in the series. A Great job!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|It is a very useful and handy app. I'm very pleased !!!! Able to download songs as mp3 as welll as watch and download videos for offline enjoyment..
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This is the first novel I have read from Lee Child.  I admit I am not finished with the book but only because responsibilities keep me from finishing.  I like the characters and the suspense of the novel. On one hand I am looking forward to finishing the book, yet I don't want it to end.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|While I usually wait until my birthday to read the winter releases, just couldn't wait.  THE Best since Liseys Story!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|James Labrie just cant sing any more and it ruins most of the songs.<br /><br />False awakening is a good intro.<br />The enemy inside is great.<br />Looking glass is just OK.<br />Enigma Machine is Very good.<br />The Bigger Picture is boring. Dream theater used to write good ballads, but have not done so on the past 3 or 4 albums.<br />Behind the veil is good.<br />Surrender to reason makes me cringe when James starts singing. The rest of it is fairly boring.<br />Along for the ride... Meh...<br />Illumination Theory start out good, but all of a sudden you're listening to a movie score... WTF? and after that James shows how he can murder the art of singing again and then it gets boring again.<br /><br />After ADTOE I was really looking forward to this album, it was much better than Black clouds and systematic chaos, but this album is another step in the wrong direction. On the bright side Mangini's drums sound much better than the last one.
B003YFIUW8|3.0|As other reviews have stated, this is the story of a horrific kidnapping, imprisonment, and repeated rape of a young girl. This girl gets impregnated by her rapist and Room is told through the eyes of her young son, Jack. All Jack knows is the small Room where he and his &#34;Ma&#34; live. Overall, I thought this was a good book but not excellent. I did eventually get annoyed by Jack's &#34;writing style.&#34; I would have been just as interested in this book if it was told through the mother's eyes, maybe even more interested.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|One of the top ten westerns in the last 30 yrs.  A worthy purchase and one to put in the library.  Shame the two fellows starring don't do another.  Great story lines.  Enjoy
1476734941|3.0|Still reading, learning, look forward to getting started! I hope I'll be able to get through the Fast days, will take practice and creativity to be successful.
B00CQ8U5ZE|5.0|this movie is really very good its a true story which make,s it even more enjoyable to watch, it has a great cast and if you like first blood you are going to like this one another top c bronson outing, 10 out of 10 great.
B004EI3ON4|3.0|This is most of what you would expect from the Tron Legacy soundtrack. I enjoy it all however it is short and doesn't have every song from the movie. The price was right and nothing is bad it just doesn't rock my world the way something with amazing/stellar songs would nor does it sustain my entertainment for an entire drive home. Thus 3 stars, get it if you like sound tracks and liked the movie you won't be disappointed however don't expect it to be a life changing uplifting epic deal either. It's a little bit of good where I'd have liked a little more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic! Riveting! Loved every minute! Excellent acting! Feels like I know each character intimately. If you love period shows you will definitely love Downton Abbey. Can't wait for season 4!
B007V65R54|5.0|Heading into a stats masters myself, I was looking for a good light science reader.  Although, I would not consider this book a light read, it is not heavy in calculation.  Silver does the work for you.  I enjoyed learning of the work entailed for statisticians from many industries and fields.  I would suggest this book to those that are really into stats, though some sports fans might find some interesting chapters as Silver mentions moneyball often and is himself a sports nut.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The Outlander series tends to spoil you for reading anything else.  I re-read it every year, and always look forward to the new installment every so many years.
B0000032LS|5.0|What can I say...I bought it as a gift...It arrived on time and in good condition...my niece loved it...I'm happy.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|The game flows great - I am giving it 4 stars as I am not sure about the difficulty levels as I can beat it on level 4 and I haven't played in years!
B008602KQI|5.0|I love this movie.  Amazon prime instant video is a great service.  I like amazon way better than netflix.  No complaints from me.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|very cool and fun to play if you like minions and there adorable way of life... fun and challenging to play..
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I ordered the DVD set instead of the Blue Ray by mistake. Thinking the picture quality and format would not look good. I was presently surprised how good looked on my TV. The cover and disk are awesome, love the collection.
B001EC0OMM|5.0|I have seen this movies 100's of times and I can watch it hundreds more.....love the chemistry!!! Great movie wo watch when you're tired of watching commercials and repeats on cable! Make some popcorn, ice tea put your feet up and prepare to be truly entertained!!
0805092447|5.0|This book is a classic book for early childhood. It has repetition, rhyme, colorful pictures, just a great book to encourage young children to read!! They'll have you reading it over and over again to them!!
B000W8HC8I|4.0|long!!!! Much more adult content than I like. However...excellent story, real view of Early Wall Street, and a good reminder that the simple life is what most people strive for.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|The movie has a very weak story line, good actors and really annoying music. Cinematography is like a quick slip of the hand...shaky and lots of fast spinning around character, to the point that you may get dizzy.<br />In all a waste of time!
B00F0AAC26|5.0|This is one of the finest new music releases in a long time. It is funky, soulful, and fun to listen to. It is a great combination of conventional and electronic instrumentation with the world-renowned voice of one of the great innovators - Costello. Bravo!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a amazing game for kids and adults it's a very very fun game that people are hooked on
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephen King leaves the reader flabbergasted, disturbed and wanting more. The Shining has proved to be one of his best novels. I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love this game it is very addictive and lots of fun. Only downside is waiting for energy which stops me playing as much as I would like
B002M9WW30|5.0|It's one of the sagas in film that has caused more impact on my life. The real, authentic Rocky's fight lies, not with rivals of flesh & blood, but with life itself & destiny. He fully understood, his real victory & greatness is to beat the destination. A very well constructed story by Stallone leaving us rather than a national hero, an iconic character of all time.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|It's too easy I finished it in like an hour. There's only ten levels. The last level is hard but that's all at least it's free.
0425266060|5.0|I enjoyed this series better than the 50 Shades of Grey series.  The main female character is not so whining and annoying like in 50 Shades of Grey's.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was flat out amazing! This is by far the best hunger games book!Just  a wonder filled read. I wish the series was longer than three books though!
034580404X|4.0|Yes, there is fun toys mentioned with the typical insecure relationship. Definitely gets the mind turning with new things to try in the bedroom.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I rated the book a 4 star book because it lost my attention at some parts. Otherwise I loved<br />it! :D
0439023513|4.0|The first two books in the series were a little better. If you're expecting more of the same arena action, this isn't it. I like that it goes in a different direction, and most of it is well-paced, but the ending seems to snowball a bit too much, and after a sort of lagging middle section, the last third of it rolls far too fast and ends a little too predictably. Kat is still a terrific heroine, but this book, unlike the first two, did not leave me wanting more. Rather, I was satisfied that it was over.
1878424319|5.0|I had to purchase this book for my Interpersonal Communication class. The book store was had this book price at $15 with a no return policy. I decided that buying a used book from amazon would be a lot better. This book was not only in my budget it shipped quickly and the book is in perfect condition! You can't even tell it's used.
B00EMIE0CA|5.0|I've been a Spyro Gyra fan for decades, and love seeing them live.  But I am sometimes disappointed in their studio albums because they seem more aimed at light jazz radio than what the band delivers live.  This album captures more of the feeling of the live experience.  Strong grooves, hot solos, good energy.  One of their strongest efforts in years.  Keep it up!
B00F3YHMUE|4.0|I've got to hand it to Sting for his willingness to take on new challenges, whether it's lute music on [[ASIN:B000HXDESU Songs from the Labyrinth]], seasonal music on [[ASIN:B002H3F7F6 If On A Winter's Night...]] and symphonic versions of his songs on [[ASIN:B003LAH7MU Symphonicities]] you have to wonder what he has left to try?  And so we have Sting's stab at a Broadway show with \\"The Last Ship\\"...his first studio album of new songs in a decade and which are destined for his Broadway show to open in 2014.  Talk about your High Risk gambit here!  Rather than going through of Broadway, testing the material and tweaking it, Sting boldly plunges right into revealing the source material before even the off-Broadway run in Chicago ends.  Clearly he has faith in it and it seems like the bugs have been worked out on the show as it now moves to the Great White Way.  The reviews of the show have been generally favorable, but it's time to take a look at the source material as Sting presents it.  That often can be a daunting task as too often it can lack the vitality and energy of live theatre.<br /><br />In honesty the first few songs (\\"The Last Ship\\", \\"Dead Man's Boots\\") lack the liveliness or vitality you expect from a Broadway musical. They move along at a languid pace, imparting essential information but not exactly exciting the audience.  Some of the songs are achingly lovely like \\"August Winds\\" and  the otherwise quite beautiful \\"Language of Birds\\" but I still don't get a sense of how they connect and how they create the song structure that holds a play together.  When you get to \\"The Night The Pugilist Learned How To Dance\\", you finally get the sense of warmth and whimsy I was hoping for, and I loved the accordion in the background and Sting slipping into his Geordie accent.  You finally get the drama of it all with \\"Ballad of the Great Eastern\\"...a perfect example of storytelling, with violins, and great drumming.  The how finally hits stride with \\"What Have We Got\\" a whipped up shanty of a song with great call and response that FINALLY sounds like a Broadway musical, engaging the audience.  \\"So To Speak\\" is a great summation of what has passed in keeping with a Broadway musical.<br /><br />Listening to \\"The Last Ship\\" is tricky without the visuals and a sense of what the play is trying to convey.  As an album it's OK...not exactly a thriller, but I get a sense of what Sting is trying to create and convey here as a musical.  It's just without having seen that musical I feel left in the dark.  It certainly does make me want to see it and I'm fairly certain it will do well.  Perhaps this is whetting our whistles for what is to come!whipped up shanty of a song with great call and response that FINALLY sounds like a Broadway musical, engaging the audience.  \\"So To Speak\\" is a great summation of what has passed in keeping with a Broadway musical.<br /><br />Listening to \\"The Last Ship\\" is tricky without the visuals and a sense of what the play is trying to convey.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|So, down to earth and humorous.  Just what we new thinkers need.  It certainly echoes my thoughts and past experiences.  Super easy read and such fun to try the experiments!
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great watch. Had a Seiko from the 70's that recently broke and I replaced it with this one.<br />So far it is keeping time like it should.<br /><br /> Can't beat the price and fast shipping from Amazon!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game.  I play every day but I don't chat.  Who has time? It does freeze up sometimes and I lose credits when it does.  Oh well. That is frustrating but I still enjoy the game.  I wish there were other ways to win like inside corners or letter X just to change it up some.  If you like bingo you should get this game.  The slots are great too.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|Great book!  Kept my interest the whole time.  Going to look at reading other books by the same author.  Enjoy.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I love the descriptions of all the characters and the depth of knowledge of Barcelona.  It is a great read.

1400052181|5.0|Really loved the book.  I'm going to read it again. Most unusual information. I wasn't aware of the story behind a lot of our medical research.

0330269852|5.0|I'm a beginner at marketing, and this opened my eyes to everything I was doing wrong, which was pretty much everything I was doing.  All of the advice on print ads applied easily to website ads.  A must-read, in my opinion.

B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|It was great for about a month, then quit working.  Customer support, in very bad english email, said they couldn't find my Amazon order, and blamed software conflicts with my graphics and gaming software and maybe driver issues, which duh of course I had already upgraded.  Um, hello, the thing will barely boot up.  Anyway, it's dead in both graphics and gaming software, the only reason why I got it.<br /><br />Update:<br />Since I wrote this, Anker contacted me, found my order, and replaced the mouse, which arrived about ten days ago.  It's working very well, cross fingers it continues to.
B00DTOZD4C|2.0|The 100 Year Old Man Who Climbed out of the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson.  Allan Karlsson has led an extraordinary life. He grew up in Sweden and having left school at 10 years old, he helped his mother support the family as his father had gone off to Russia to try to depose the Tsar.  He became an errand boy for Nitroglycerine Ltd and eventually learned to make explosives.  He blew up many things over his lifetime, including his house.  His motto for life came from his mother's words when she heard of her husband's death - Things are what they are and whatever will be will be.  He certainly was one of the most chilled out individuals  I ever read about.  He cared nothing about politics and yet over his life he became involved with Franco, Truman, Stalin, Mao, Nixon and many more.  He invented the atom bomb and gave it to the west and inadvertently to the east as well.  As if all that wasn't enough, at 100 years old he stole a suitcase full of money from a gang member and killed two people while making new friends with a group chased by the police.  The book began well and was wild and wacky but just got too silly for me after a while.  Keeping up with all the shenanigans began to get tiresome after a while and when an elephant became part of the gang I just switched off.  I did get to the end eventually but it was a struggle. Rating 2.5/5
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Although the cinematic universe is different than the comic universe, I've found myself enjoying this film. There's a lot of action, everyone's favorite super heroes, a great story and some laughs along the way. It has become one of my default films whenever I need something on in the background.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This is an economical hub for 3.0 USB use.  I'm able to use it with my devices that require 2.0 connections, too.
B0048PU7TC|5.0|I am so happy I found this album here! I was looking everywhere for it with no luck. This album is wonderful-- what I've learned to love about Norah Jones shines through again. Thanks :)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|VERY suspenseful, good story and colorful characters...couldn't put it down until I discovered the ending!  I would recommend it!  Enjoyable read!
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I just got this item in the mail and even in the packaging the red dot slides and doesn't stay tightly closed.  I read that in the other reviews people said the dot slid to easily and I wish I would have listened.  I didn't even open them, after seeing that it doesn't stay closed at all I decided to send them back. I found something I like a bunch better, the OXO tot on the go wipes dispenser.  It is the same size, has the string to attach it to things and has a locking case.  Sorry Skip hop, this design isn't that great!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is a awesome game but it makes you buy more levels and avatars. But again this is an awesome game and I highly recommend it to you.
B00D6SBOWG|4.0|Great solitary golf game, shame that this is only a demo. But you'll want to buy after you play it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nemos reef is fun but a bit tedious. It goes faster if you can afford pearls. Would be good for older children
B001OMJGD0|5.0|I always liked the emotional aspect of this movie, but after watching Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, I had a much larger appreciation for this movie. This movie really paid close attention to the lore and to the relationship between Superman and his dad. Watch Superman 2 RDC then watch this, you'll enjoy it more. And don't worry that there's only a few action scenes, a movie shouldn't be judged by its number of explosions.

B000W9399S|5.0|There are other, better Discworld books but you'd better read this one first. A brilliant beginning and introduction to the wild, wacky and sometimes weird world of Sir Terry's imagination.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I rented RED  because I wanted to see Red2, but wanted to see Red first.  To my surprise RED was on one of my premium movie channels.  It did not have Bruce Willis and was about a man whose faithful dog was killed by three young men.  I am surprised that the movies were both named RED.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The title suggests something obvious but the plot is much more complex. a page turner wonderfully written. The clever style of writing keeps you riveted and soothed at the same time. loved this book and anxious to read more by this author.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I got a new kindle which meant i had to re download the game on this new device, and everything seemed to be going well except your 2nd the next from the first land expansion they wanted to charge 6 digits 850,000 gold just for the second expansion or 250 pioneer bucks just for the second expansion.  I have sent several notes to the developer to fix this but never got any response, so i deleted it.  Come on expecting you to raise that level of money from a small, small, small village that has just had its first FREE expansion is a little goofy.  So it will remain deleted until they fix this problem.  Which also means the REAL CASH that i do spend on this game occasionally will never happen again until gameloft fixes the problem.

B00DP3IESY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie the first time I watched it but got a little confused at one point so I watched it a second time.  It was even better the second time because I picked up on the point I had missed when I watched it the first time. I need to pay better attention.
B007PF7MGS|5.0|Dr. and Mary McDougall have done a wonderful job in this edition. I wish it had a different title but I understand his reasoning for the title which underlies the entire make-up of the book. Dr. McDougall debunks all the nutritional myths and bad information that is so readily espoused to the public today. He backs up his claims with peer reviewed medical research references, along with his own experience of over 30 years of practicing medicine, and not just antidotal  evidence. The information is clear and concise and easy to follow. Mary has done a fabulous job with the recipes, our favorite so far is the &#34;Thai Green Curry Rice&#34;.  If you have chronic diseases (Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, High Cholesterol, Heart Disease, some Cancers) you need to read this book and start following Dr. McDougall's recommendations to reverse your disease modalities and discuss with your physician. You won't look back and your body will thank you. 5 stars.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've been looking for an alarm that would allow for white noise, different settings for the alarm and the ability to dim the display. This seems to fill all my needs.
B0018RFLQ2|5.0|Our 7 year old recently took an interest in Chess. A great movie for him and the whole family. Many lessons to be learned. Insightful for children and adults as well.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is an awesome Bingo game. I haven't played on Facebook in a long time, but glad to see I didn't have to start all over again. All my FB items transferred to my tablet.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is going to be a classic.  Liesel Meminger is Anne Frank-through the looking glass.  Just an innocent little girl growing up in Nazi Germany.  If you don't love this book, you are already dead.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Really enjoyed the twists in this one! Looking forward to the next one in October 2013 and having it on the kindle is so convenient.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Addictive and epic story telling cast perfectly and set in beautiful locations. HBO creates the best series and employ the most creative artists
B007URVZJ6|1.0|I have taught people how to build websites and how to use MSWord, the two skills that the author relies on.  However, even I could not follow her instructions.  I wasted hours and hours trying to figure out what she was really saying.  In the end I gave up using her method entirely.  She does have some helpful suggestions on formatting the Word document IF you already know the skills required.  But her instructions when the book is transposed to an html file are incomprehensible.<br /><br />My best suggestion is to understand the limitations of Kindle formatting.  e.g., Use one column, avoid fancy indents and fonts.  Should you have a recipe book, put all the ingredients in one column, not two.  Should you have a poem with a variable line indent, change it to a left aligned format.  If you really cannot work with the standard Kindle formatting, hire a professional to re-format your document.  It will save you hours of agony.
B005COO1X6|3.0|A car that kills people. Does this plot sound familiar to anyone who reads Stephen King? I love King usually, but it seems like he's in need of some new material.
B00422LESO|5.0|Perfection. I actually felt butterflies just reading it. It gave me hope that my Mr. Nobely is out there somewhere!
B008Y71JCE|5.0|Well worth watching. One of my go to movies for whenI want to watch something, but can't seem to decide on what. I rate movies on whether or not I'll watch them again. This one is in my collection.
B00447G2MK|5.0|I'm so happy about this purchase! I've been a fan of ADTR for quite a while now and I just could never really afford to buy any of their CDs (I'm not one for illegally downloading) or I just forgot about them the few times I could afford CDs and I was just so happy when I got it. Super fast shipping! Brand new CD! Just amazing! Thank you!
B000HZHPSS|5.0|Funny, techy, and totally Star Trek. Where have all the real Star Trek Producers gone? I guess they died with Gene Roddenbury. If you want to see what Star Trek is supposed to be, watch this movie.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I've used this app for close to a year now and its only gotten better as time goes on. although not a huge fan of the new layout, the old one I was already so used ti.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Great format. Easy to use. Neat and clean. Gets to the point, just like the network. Stays away from dumb politics and just does what it should, focus' on the stock market and news, yes I said news, that is relavent to the markets. CNBC take note: this is what we want, not entertainment and opinions, Thats what FOX NEWS and the E Network is for!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Great storytelling till the very end. Read all of the books!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I've been a long time viewer of TED and I'm happy the app is as good as the website. Try it, you'll like it.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I have been wanting this game and now it is on kindle fire!! I'm so happy!! The Game is awesome because  it is! I love it!! Dumb ways die so many dumb ways to die
B00124BNF4|5.0|What can I say... they don't make rock like this anymore. But they should! Every so called musician should take notes from this album.
B007T99ENE|3.0|Set in the Cold War, this book looks at how women were used in the British Secret Service. I was intrigued at times, but mostly a bit disappointed.
B00A23MVHA|5.0|And this is one of them. Truly funny and resourceful. Elegant in it's storytelling, with all the naughtiness of an adult comedy, without the Howard Stern college fart joke excuses for humor.
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|If I told you what this book was about and the genre you would think I was out of my mind to give it 5 stars. But seriously, I couldn't put it down, it is sarcastic and funny and I think everyone should read it.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|Unfortunately, they can't seem to get the message about Batman. Quit while you're a head. There is only room for new stories in the batman saga. Remaking the same great stories every few years is not movie making, or even story telling, It's a desperate attempt to cash in. Stop with the remakes already and make good movies like this one.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|Can't believe I only read this now. It is simply a classic. I really wish I didn't have so much to read, otherwise I would just devour the second one immediately.
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|Clint Eastwood can make great movies. Whether he's in front of the camera, or behind it, he knows great story telling. One of my top ten all time picks. This movie rates with the Natural, A league of their Own and For love of the Game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The continuation of a captivating series.  A rivoting story with amazing actors,  My goodness, to have Dame Maggie Smith acting with Oscar winning actor Shirley McLain is beyond imagination. The season finale was devastating but presents the audience with a new vision of the future and reality of the ordinary person's life.  God gives and takes away in a heartbeat, no matter whether you are Upstairs or Downstairs... life's equality among the classes.  Great season, looking forward to Season 4
B00946WM6Q|3.0|It's Ok, but not really what you want. Lots of chases, car crashes, stunts and explosions, but seriously lacking in the story department. The performances are great, but even good acyors can't replace a good storyline and this one is severely lacking in that department.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I love playing this app. Big draw back though is when I got my new kindle fire HD I lost everything from previous play. I had built up my score thing to x30 all the way. Also lost all my characters I had bought or gotten with collecting the things from the prize boxes and lost all my special people and or products like the China runner and the special boards from the China run. Really thinking of removing the app from my kindle fire HD because I hate the fact I basically have forestall over losing everything including things I cannot replace!!!!!!!!!!!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Great shows are gettingnharder and harder to find, so look no further than Mad Men regardless of the season, this is areally great show!
0399165274|5.0|The price is competitive. Forsyth is my fav author. This is another masterpiece by him. Hope this book will evoke more concern about the lawlessness of Somalia and the threat posed by al-Shabaab.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|The premise is great, but the producers didn't see where to go with it. It falls a little short, but there are some fine performances that pull it through. It's worth a watch, but may not be a keeper.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app! It makes texting my friends so much faster and easier! A definite must get, I love the purple keyboards.
0783114893|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Here is one for you Rutger Hauer fans! Rutger once again playing his patented brand of cinema psycho, as he hitches a ride with a young Thomas C. Howell, & terrorizes him all over the southwest.<br /><br />Classic match up of good vs. evil. Naivety vs. experience. The weak vs. the strong, with a no prisoners attitude. \\"The Hitcher\\" is a white knuckle thrill ride you won't want to jump off of.<br /><br />Beware of fingers in french fries!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Can't wait to watch it again! This is my new favorite show. Bravo PBS! Bring on season four as quick as possible.
B003O86FMW|4.0|No matter how many times I read this book, it still keeps me on the edge of my seat; I always want more. The way that every detail is laid out for the reader to see, to touch, to hear, to smell, to savor, or to imagine is incredible and Suzanne Collins has a magnificent way of tugging at envy emotion in the readers hearts. GREAT BOOK!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I am no good at the shootemup games, but this is great fun and at least I understand what I have to do, and don't have to collect weapons and fight monsters.  I can cope with little green pigs.  Just think about all those people you really, really don't like and your aim will get better every time!
B001HBWY8M|5.0|So this movie was more of a throw back to when I was growing up. I have always been an Amanda Bynes fan and this is just another one of her great movies. Its a very touching story about the two big things a girl growing into adulthood could go through: Figuring out who she is and where she fits into the world. The story is touching, hilarious, and just makes you love the old films.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Plot is hard to believe ( not a surprise) and it doesn't look like he worked too hard on this one. Hopefully the next one is better.
B003B96AOW|4.0|So this thing looks super cool but has a few problems. The big one display wise being that it in no way stands straight up like the one they have in the picture. Its legs have joint at the knees so those want to bend and it ends up leaning against the wall. Aside from that you need to be careful with the swords that go into the harness on his back, as by simply dusting the figure the top of one of his swords just snapped off.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Dull and totally just a ripoff of Block Life nothing to even do in it....<br />Mojang should be sued for such a complete and utter rip off of block life.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|This 25th Annniversry edition is beautiful.  This &#34;Angel of Music&#34;, Sierra Boggess, outsings Sarah Brighton in in this magnificant version.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I Love This Game I Cant Wait Until We Can Use Redstone And ummm.... Speaking Of Which When Is The Next Update?
B00448VST6|5.0|Feel good nerdy movie.  Fantasy and reality mash up well.  I actually thought Knives was better looking though, but Cera had to have the 'girl from his dreams'.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great performances, stunning visuals and mind twisting plot.<br />Oblivion is a 2013 American post-apocalyptic science fiction film based on Joseph Kosinski's Radical Comics-edited unpublished graphic novel of the same name. The film was co-written, produced and directed by Kosinski.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|There's a great variety of sounds for a free version of this app however, some of the melodies are repetitive and after awhile I've found them to be rather annoying.  It would be great if the melodies were a whole song instead of the same musical phrase over and over.  That said, it is still interesting to layer sounds one on top of the other.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Suffice it to say, I am totally addicted to this series. I just finished watching all three seasons and am anxiously awaiting season 4 to start. If you love extremely well written stories with perfect casting, beautiful settings and deep characters you will love this series!  The Brits just seem to have a knack for exceptional entertainment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Weird to say.,  but this book brought the tears.  Defining moments and tenderness you don't expect. This was my favorite
B000FBFN1U|5.0|The thing I love most about George R.R. Martin's writing is that I'm always surprised.  Guaranteed before you finish one of his book you will have your mouth open with awe....or suddenly find yourself crying for a character you thought you'd see to the end of the series.  I love it!
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Great fun and, for the most part, appropriate for children under age 6.  This movie takes scary and makes it funny.  The premise is that the monsters are afraid of humans!  It makes for some good fun.  However, younger children should NOT BE left alone to watch this.  Parental guidance is necessary.  Have fun!
B00AEBEQW8|3.0|Illustrations are great but my son wasn't very interested in the story line. Not sure it's worth the current price tag.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved every minute of it! Any Marvel comic fan will love this movie! It is worth the money to rent or buy!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I am loving this book so far! It has a great storyline and characters. I recommend it. I can't put it down. =)
1594484805|5.0|I have read it twice as I am a team leader. Good book and worth reading. Info that one can put to use.
B00F8GYC1Y|2.0|I'm sorry, but this is nowhere near as good as the first one, extremely disappointing how easy it is.  I played for 20 minutes and beat 30 levels.  Aside from the glitches and frequent reboots, the characters are extremely cheesy.  The graphics are nice, though...
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|This is the best angry birds game yet. I've only been playing for a few days, but the levels are challenging, but fun, and the characters are great.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I am really enjoying The Outlander series. I am very fond of the Scottish History and since I am only on 4 I have lots left to discover.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|fun to play .  game seemed a little unresponsive.  I had to push many times to get the object to move.
B00DJZR46G|5.0|At first listen you think this album is slow...on second the beauty and diversity start to become clear. I think it's his best since Songs From The West Coast (a very underrated and overlooked album that stands up to and with any of his classic material). I think Bernie Taupin's lyrics are as strong as ever and have reached a maturity unseen before. Frankly, I can't play this album enough and that's the sign of a good album to me. The Union (his last album) I wanted to like this much and couldn't. I felt that the production was muddy, dull and the songs the same except for a few (Gone To Shiloh is a classic) exceptions. This album is strong from start to finish and I find joy in knowing Elton & Bernie can still deliver the goods. Highly Wreckamended! (we know who we are!)
B003B02PEU|4.0|Yes, he has done it again with a can't-put-down tale that purportedly exposes the seedy side to the US Justice System. He does tend to digress a bit with his character studies of the female protagonist, but this has probably been done to stuff what otherwise would have been a rather short tale.<br />The ending is entirely unexpected - all the better. Let's only hope Grisham goes on to produce more stories like this one,  as well as continue his good work in real life aimed at improving the lot of anyone entangled in the system.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I did not play this, my neice did she loved it I don't play games on my computer. So I am nutral on this.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I LOVED IT IS THE BEST BOOK EVER MORE BOOKS PEASE I LOVE THEM MORE THAN ANYTHING YEAH YEAH YEAH!!!!!
1596680296|4.0|This book was reccomended by a friend, she absolutely loves it. I have looked through it but have not really relly dug in to see just how much I like it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app works great no bugs is easy to use and helps me out when my brains feeling lazy. :)
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I downloaded it but I am still learing how to use it, so I am nutral on this. Looking forward to learning how to use this site better.
B00594XOZU|1.0|This app is always saying its taking to long try again in a bit i love this app but fix pls
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|It is a very good series and I love the actors.  I hope the series continues into several seasons.  Nice.
B001BANK32|4.0|I am a big Stephen King fan. Have read all of his books, except for a few short stories. When I realized that his next book coming out in the fall was the sequel to the Shining, I also realized I had never read it. So  I bought it. It is a scary tale. Sorry it took so long for me to get to it.<br /><br />It will keep you interested until the end, and it is set up to make you wonder what happens to the characters later.<br /><br />There is one other question it posed for me. Did Mr. King know about quantum theory when this was written? It is a good attempt to explain what is happening in our world if that theory is correct.
030789701X|5.0|This has been an absolutely fabulous guide to help get things accomplished in this huge game.  I would highly recommend getting this if you want to complete allot of things in game, trust me it's worth it.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Game of Thrones is an awesome HBO series. Having it on BluRay makes it much better watching it on our 70&#34; tv
1444737090|5.0|This is a book for anyone who has ever had a special bond with an animal ( or would like to ) . It gives new meaning to the term &#34;rescue&#34; pet. So often the pets we rescue - really rescue us, right PTaz?
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|As always any movie by JJ is going to be a well written thrill ride, and Into Darkness is no exception, he rocked the story and the screen play.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Slow to start, but an incredible climax that keeps you turning the pages.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I was blown away by the story and the depth of character back story in this one. Highly recommend to anyone.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Needs at least hulu to be useful. Good concept but no follow through. Gets stuck while playing youtube video sometimes.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Sorry action fans but this one is a dud.. Confusing in its never ending attempt to have action scenes. they were just jumbled together until they reached 90 minutes.
0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner was well put together and a solid read. The author did an excellent job on pacing, plot, and CHARACTER, in spite of what some negative reviewers stated. If you want a book with some protagonist going on and on about their past, go read a book like Divergent. If you want a fast paced read with three dimensional characters based on the way they act, this is the book to read.<br /><br />We should all look forward to the movie!
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|this is just fun fun fun. We watched it twice in one night and then again a week later. My wife loves Robert and replayed his little dance at the beginning of the story several times just to sigh.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Just what you want &amp; just as advertised.<br />No training needed.  What else do you want to know?<br />How sweet!
0307279189|5.0|A truly inspirational book, even your running philosophy isn't quite the same.  Christopher McDougall is well spoken and written.  If you like this book, or want an insight into it, look up McDougall's TED Talk.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I am a huge fan of Google and their products, but was disappointed with the performance of the Chromecast. Most of the time I would try to cast something and my computer couldn't find Chromecast, even though the TV screen said that it was ready. I think that there were probably issues with my network, and perhaps I need to upgrade my modem and/or router. Having said that, I still think that the Chromecast device had something to do with it. I'm sure I will try again once I manage to sort out my network and make sure everything is up to speed.
B008LUM1JO|5.0|Tons of twists and turns a good read. A gripping storyline and interesting characters. Overall a very exciting book to read
B00AYB0YFQ|5.0|Haven't seen this movie in years, it was almost new to me when I saw it again. Big belly laughs if you like silly movies
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It's ok. The original was better in my opinion. Visually this was very good but the original gave a better build up I Dredd himself.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Still prefer the original with Stallone as main character!! The mix futuristic and this era in time not what I expected!
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My 2 year old really enjoys this game and he plays it often. Several different types of vehicles to choose from, so endless fun.
B00DQVST76|5.0|I was lucky enough to sit front row in the Golden Triangle for this show and now getting to see it from a different perspective just adds to the whole experience. The sounds and clarity are amazing!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Too hard for my 2 year old to play.  Although he enjoys trying, he can't get very far with this game.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|I love being able to have this at my fingertips...fantastic! Getting to relive this show over and over is wonderful!
B00632HWOG|5.0|we all need email! This app makes it easy to check your Yahoo email on the go. good to have on hand
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|The movie was a little to vulgar and to violent for young children  to graphic for a family show .
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Cute game, but too hard for my 2 year old to play. Graphics were cute, so we are disappointed with it.
B00C9QQBA6|4.0|I especially enjoy reading stories that are based, even a tiny bit, on a real life event.  Although the Aurora crash was most likely a hoax to attract attention to an economically dying town, the newspaper article and description of the accident was real enough to make it an historical account.<br /><br />With \\"Crash Landing\\" the authors take us back to the accident, in 1897, that sparks the Aurora Conspiracy series, and they've done an excellent job of setting the stage.  The historical background allows for the almost immediate suspension of disbelief that is essential to enjoying a work of fiction, especially in the science fiction genre.  The writing is tight with few grammatical errors indicating that the authors take comments and reviews seriously.  I was unable to find most of the `cons' listed in previous 3 star reviews.<br /><br />Characterization, a great premise and a solid ability to \\"show\\" not \\"tell\\", make this short entree into the series entertaining and engaging.  I'm looking forward to the rest of the story.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|It looked way too violent for our purposes so we did not play it more than once. Big disappointment for us.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Having read all the books about Harry Hole, it was great to go back to his first big case. I also got a lot to learn about Austrialia.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Just like the movie. Starts out great but gets somewhat boring. We leave it for a few days and then come back. But is still a fun kids learning village.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I purchased this DVD to add to my wife's collection for her birthday. She loves it, and it arrived before the appointed date. So, it came early, very inexpensive, and my wife loves it. I will recommend this company to my family and friends.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game but it gets expensive on higher levels so can't play many games a day. Also like the fact they offer slot games as well
B000PY52EU|4.0|I purchased this DVD to add to my collection. It arrived before the appointed date, and was  very inexpensive. I will recommend this company to my family and friends.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|A simple and well structured guide to publishing on Amazon.  Very good indeed.  Even a technophobe like me could follow it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While some of the reviews of these series on Amazon are less than glowing, I feel that the Fifty Shades Trilogy delivers EXACTLY what it promises. These books are not Hemingway, so don't expect deep literary character development. But, it is pure erotica at it's best, with a good dose of romance and suspense.
B009K72RRS|5.0|Was very happy to finally catch up on this show with Instant Video. Very glad I did, it was well worth it and a great series.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I, like other people, just have to read the book before it turns into a movie, even if you have no interest what so ever. So I went ahead and read the first book, but after the first I fell in love with every single detail of the book. I would recommend this book for people have an interest in fantasy, romance, action. It delivers a lot.
0761174192|5.0|Buy every year.<br /><br />Love to have on my desk @ work.<br /><br />I take a few minutes every day to just relax and stare into their peaceful faces.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like the app because it trains people brains and it help make the time past much quicker and do something when there is nothing to do aground the house or take a break with housework to.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I wish there was multiplayer so I can play with my friends PS this game is epic<br />but multiplayer is needed
B00CM03H4C|5.0|As soon as I saw this movie, I remembered why I love Baz Luhrmann, and I knew I was going to have this soundtrack. I bought it before I've even gotten the movie. If you loved the movie and want to remember that feeling, buy this soundtrack.<br /><br />The whole album is worth it just for \\"Back to Black\\". Beyonce's voice on that track is delicious poison.
B002I9TYQM|5.0|The English/French version, is definitely the bluray to get of Dark Crystal. I have the old fashioned standard def dvd of it and where there were shadows in the movies everything would be dark and grainy. in this version of bluray, the colors are so bright and colorful it's almost blinding! I think this is what it must have looked like when the movie was in the theaters! I'm absolutely happy I bought this one, I saw all the bad reviews of the regular English only bluray not being a good transfer and am glad I got this one instead!
0345803485|5.0|Got the book in a pretty timely fashion and the book was in great shape. Have started to read it but have not read too much yrt only because I'm so tired.
B009EQG80W|5.0|Those who want to change their life definitely have to read this book. Gr8 Read. Share it. Definitely you will Enjoy
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|Good God, I love this CD .  It is story telling at its absolute best.  Each song paints a word picture that your ears will not be able to stop listening to, Ever music collection must include &#34;The Diving Board&#34;  Masterpiece -100%
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I like that I can download music to my Kindle from amazon, although I have to admit I haven't used it very much, but it works perfectly.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|This movie wasn't bad. The acting was very good, but the story line just seemed to drag on and on. I was watching it with my dad and my best friend. My dad had to leave half way through the movie, but my best friend and I quickly got bored, especially as it dragged on more. Again, wonderful acting, just too long and dragged on.
B00AEFYGJW|5.0|One of my favorite movies!! Love the action and excitement of it all and Angelina Jolie is awesome in this role!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie I actually had seen in theatres and I loved it so much I had to show it to my parents as well. It seems really weird at first, but it has a wonderful story to it how two people, even through the madness, found love. It's just an adorable way to look at life.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|This is by far the best way to purchase Star Wars. Yes, the DVD release had a lot of Edits in it, but the bonus disc has the original theatrical version on it! For true fans.
B008476HBM|5.0|My library is reading Jane Austen for the month of October.  I could read this book over and over again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Not much more to say than that. It captured me from the start and I was streaming tears at the end. Very rare and powerful story. A must read.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like this app but I cant tell if it uses more battery to measure it. its pretty cool tho.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Although it wasn't quite what I had expected (okay, it wasn't anywhere close to what I had expected), I was not disappointed. Mr. King delivered an antagonist that was both shocking and utterly horrifying in her (its?) entirety. I can't say much about this novel without maybe letting go with some spoilers. I wouldn't want to do that. If you're a fan of Stephen King, and liked The Shining, then get this book. I read it in less than two days and plan to go back and read it very slowly again soon.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|Enjoyed the game &amp; was challenging but for the price that I paid was disappointed that it didn't last longer, first time spending that much on a game &amp; will be the last time.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Absolutely mind boggling. Riveting. Not an easy book to put down once you get going. Will give you an entirely different perspective of Mother India.
B000ARFNNM|4.0|I enjoyed listening and watching - hearing the comments.  thank you for putting this as part of the Pretty Woman Special Edition.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie has the stuff.  If you like a movie with all the attributes to making a good movie, you will find it in this movie coming and going.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|game was fun and challenging. You need to make more games like it. ok thanks for reading my summary about your game .
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best it rocks the best he it is the best ow yes it is it rocks pick this for a calculated do not pick anything else
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I didn't think another zombie feature could really add anything, especially with such a notable A-list celeb, but WWZ sucked me in from beginning to end.  Intense throughout, but with a very heatfelt human element too, this movie didn't disappoint.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its amazing it will get you addicted .. i play it for hours &lt;3<br />Very recocmended for downloading.. you wont get enough
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|It was good, entertaining, decent story.  Enough twists and plot to keep it interesting and fresh.  It's a good rental.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|I'm not going to get in depth because there are plenty of reviews that do. All I'm saying is that I was a little disappointed in this movie. It still has all of the action but I think this movie was trying to humanize and humble Tony Stark/Iron Man more then make him a hero. I liked the old cocky Tony Stark. I'm not saying this was a bad movie, it just wasn't the Iron Man I loved. And I really did not care for the ending. It kind of ruined the whole experience for me. I would give it 3.5 stars.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|This is one of those shows that you can watch over and over. Whenever I have that need to watch a good chick flick, this fits the bill. Emma is pretty, and fun, and the leading man, well. I'm a big fan. I enjoyed every minute. Thinking of buying it so I can watch it on my big screen vrs my small little kindle. I liked that much.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|I was just bored. I wanted to watch something. I don't recommend it. ...a bit off and odd. Not recommended.
B001EA4M7M|3.0|It was OK. I'm glad I watched it, but I probably wont watch this version again. Maybe it would have helped if the Mr. Darcy were more handsome?
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|Bought this for my nephew and he loves it. Fun to play with and very popular with him and his friends.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This move has been part of our family Christmas tradition for years.  We watch it several times during the season.  It is just hysterical !!!  Another great quirky Christmas move is &#34;The Ref&#34; with Denis Leary...also hysterical !!<br /><br />I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants some laughs !!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Bought this Cd for the brother for his birthday.He couldn't be happier. The songs are fantastic. Rush is awesome!!! Buy this CD!!  You will not be sorry!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Boring and repeated situations. Miss Steele and Mr.Grey are unreal like to Batman and Robin. Absolutely not my cup of tea.<br />Didn't finish the first book.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A Gripping novel about the hearts of people during a time in our country that seemed so unfair.  Fast paced and intense.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Fantastic movie and super speedy delivery!  I wish it included the additional features but it does had both a 2D and 3D DVD.
0062238868|1.0|Say what you will about the content of this book or the author's character, but what I had a hard time was how poorly it was written.  The narrative feels fragmented and scattered and it doesn't read very well.  Ultimately, it reflects poorly on the author and detracts from his heroic service.  I'm not sure if he wrote the book or had a ghost writer pen the book, but it was pretty bad.  I also got annoyed with the author referring to non-Texans as \\"yankees.\\"  In fairness to Mr. Kyle, however, the book did have a clear and consistent voice (I just happen to not be terribly fond of Texas and people who think its the greatest place ever).  That said, he should be commended for his service and it is a shame that he was murdered after surviving so many dangerous battles and deployments.
B003VANOFY|1.0|They were great at first -- surround sounds with wireless, but now they cut out for 10 seconds at a time about every 5mins.  I've had the unit for about 6 months and the battery life seems to be sufficient for what I use it for (music and games) which can be several hours between a charge sometimes.  Unfortunately the cutting out for seconds at a time will become more frequent and frustrating the longer you have this unit.  Try the competitor.
B005XI91FY|5.0|Of course I love it! Who doesnt love steel panther? Yeeeha!!! This is the most entertaining band in music right now
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|From the first few minutes readings this book I was drawn into the lives of the characters.  It has been a long time since I read a book in which I could empathize with each and every one. This is the first book I have read by this author but certainly not the last.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app was the first thing I downloaded immediately. Why wait til the end of the news program when it takes a minute to get a week's forecast. Great for anybody!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|No at all cute - to me it was laugh out loud funny in the way of the old Looney Tunes. Made for adults & just likely a safe colorfully safe distraction for the little rug rats in your life. They won't get it but they'll sit there shut up & watch it while you do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great. Easy to use and very convenient. Works better and looks nicer than others I've tried. Works perfectly on the kindle fire.
B00BEIYMIS|3.0|This is one of the best movie of the year, and probably one of the best horror flick ever. So I wonder why they put this terrible cover on the blu-ray ? Don't they want to<br />sell it ? Really, this picture deserves a better treatment. I'm really mad about this awful job, the guys who made that should be put together in this house and locked in the basement for ever, and ever, and ever...
B00D6DVSAE|5.0|Those expecting a new pop album from Sting will be disappointed. The Last Ship is an epic 20-song soundtrack written for a play due on Broadway next year. As such it's incredibly successful in its breadth of storytelling, character and musical styles, and features some of Sting's best lyrics since The Soul Cages. It's a foot-stomping, heart-wrenching, depressing, uplifting, cerebral and comic voyage.<br /><br />I can't wait to see it live on stage, and like the adaptation of Once on Broadway, I'm glad I'll know most of the songs. If musical theater doesn't rock your boat though, then this one's not for you. It's just not your traditional radio-friendly pop/rock album, but it's way more approachable than the lute or winter albums.<br /><br />It's a shame that this was also released as a condensed 12-track CD (for marketing purposes I assume) because the missing 8 tracks do tell a more complete story and are each worthy of being included. Songs like Shipyard, Hadaway, Sky Hooks and Tartan Paint, and Show Some Respect will play very well on stage. And the full duet of Practical Arrangement featuring Jo Lawry adds poignancy to an already moving song.
B002UXRGM0|1.0|I work Days, like most, and find that I just don't have the time to get down to the mall and shop for the things I want. I found Amazon to be a great way to get the things I wanted, and the price wasn't too bad either..... that was, until I made this purchase. Firstly, the product came late, but more importantly, it never actually showed up at my house at all! I received a notice from the post office in the mail saying that the product was waiting for me at the local post office branch (About 25 miles from my home) and I could pick it up during regular business hours, after paying a $15.00 COD. I sent an email to customer service, and the response back was to credit my account for the $15.00, and in their minds that was all well and good! Well, it's not! I don't have the time during the day to go pick up this package, and if I did, I would have gone to the Walmart  that is much closer to my home and bought the product there. I refuse to jump through hoops to get this product anymore, and asked for my money back...... I have never received it! As far as I am concerned, Amazon has stolen from me, and I will never order another product from them again...... Thank you for making me a loyal customer of Bestbuy.com, and I will make sure to warn off everyone I know from using your services in the future
0156711427|5.0|This was such a good book.  We saw the movie, but the book was even better than the film.  Thank you for sending it early,  and in wonderful condition.  Thank you!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use it for inspiration and wish lists. Great ideas for home,  crafts,  things to do with kids; its a catalog that I get to choose the content.
0394800184|5.0|A wonderful story every child should have while learning to read.  I still have the one from my childhood and give it to every niece and nephew at their baby shower
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Excellent Show! I love the twists and turns. If you like zombies... you will love this! Leaves you wanting more!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is okay but kind of boring and too slow for anyone who likes to play fast paced games
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Reflected In You picks up right were Bared To You leaves off. Eva is still acting like and immature spoiled 'Shank' who has to have her way in everything. I was hoping to like Eva more in this 2nd book but her character constantly disappoints. What did it for me with Eva was she meets her EX at concert and kisses him in front of a huge crowd like they are still lovers. Poor Gideon beats the heck out of the guy when he should have just dumped Eva at the Curb. Her friend Cory is a real freeloader who doesn't know weather he likes women or men. A real sex addict with lots of issues. Cary is  always trying to get Eva to leave Gideon and he puts poison ideas in her head. Gideon's character is written much better than Eva. His love for her shines through and he is always their for her. I think poor Gideon is unequally yoked. Another thing that bothers me was all the nightmare dreams of their rapes and abuse.Their were to many of these detailed rape scene in the story. It was like being doused with a cold bucket of water. I don't like books about rape and abuse but I tried to put my views aside to read the series. But these rape scene were to detailed to the point I got sick to my stomach. One rape victim in a story is bad enough but both of them being brutally raped as children was to much!! I do love the way Gideon stands by Eva and loves her that is the saving grace in the story and the extent he goes through to keep her safe is mind blowing.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|Find another read; very lackluster story line. Asked myself, why did i purchase this book? Characters not developed & poorly written.
B009XEE0DW|3.0|This album is still not as good as her late 80 and early 90 albums but it's Mylene Farmer and as her fan i will always buy her records! She is even more famous for her concerts it was my dream for over 22 years to see her live, so this september of 2013 i bought tickets to Paris and her concert in Bercy and let me tell you it was absolutely worth it! The music, the lights and lasers, the dancing robot snakes it all came together! There where a lot of french celebrities at the concert the one i know was Luc Besson who did a video for her and used her voice for french version of Arthur. It's a shame USA does not accept artists that don't sing in English. Her show was better than any show I've seen in Los Angeles or Las Vegas! I truly believe that the only person that did shows like that was Michael Jackson. Madonna, Kylie Minogue even Lady Gaga should all attend and learn from Mylene Faemer! And to all her USA fans I recommend to fly and see her shows! I think she has a few in France then Belgium and Russia this year. Look it up on her fan site, you will never forget it!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This is a great movie.  The writers/actors have a great chemistry and it really seemed like they are life-long friends in real life.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Downloaded twice,  still can't get on it. Bad app. Can't rate it because I can't get in to use it. Am I doing something wrong?  If some one knows the trick to this please let me know. Thanks
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I began a book and brand at the age of 41 and this book validates every instinct I have trusted and every experience that has come with this endeavor.<br /><br />If you are an entrepreneur or trying to be one this book will tell you the absolute truth about how important it is right now in 2013 to Choose Yourself.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this read. I'm a fan of the genre, but I think this one certainly had a unique take on things. Plenty of unexpected turns to keep me engrossed up to the last page.
B00413QB5A|3.0|I love Ken Follett's book, but as he stated in the prologue, this was different from his other novels.  His characters were not as defined and the plot was not as intriguing as his other novels.
B00F5F0208|5.0|Great introspective album with a melodic design of new age hip hop. Gives off a great vibe for modern hip hop with a flare of soul.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I liked this one SO much better than Gone Girl. If you've read Gone Girl and liked it....you will LOVE Sharp Objects. I'm looking forward to reading her 3rd novel as well.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Bought this a while ago and play it again and again.  Heard one of the songs by another vocalist and it wasn't half as well done
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Dumb Ways to Die is a fast-pace, cute, funny, activity. It promotes quick thinking in a humorous way. It would have received 5 stars from me if the Kindle Fire could detect &#34;blowing&#34; so the plane wouldn't crash !
B008DKBO8G|5.0|Both my Kindle and I love this product.  It goes into my purse, pocket or gym bag.  Happy, happy, happy.
B00CTT9646|4.0|Loved J.J. Abrams on making this movie it was perfection full pack of action with great story.  From the performance by Chris Pine with Zachary Quinto was perfectly awesome and ofcourse with the other cast too.  For this product the starfleet phaser was perfectly made its not plastic or styro its a solid polystone.
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Runs like a dream, I've only played the AI on easy but I have to pay attention to beat it -- I imagine it would be a real challenge at harder difficulties. It tracks how many doubles you and the AI rolls to convince you that it's not cheating...
B009JBZH54|4.0|Three great movies for Christopher Nolan in one set already fall in love when i was his The Dark Knight with Joker it was just that perfect.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|How did they make death so adorable and hilarious? So much fun and it never gets old. It even has a lumpy space princess look alike!
B009K45Y62|4.0|The final movie for Christopher Nolan was fantastic thats what you look for a batman dark with an awesome story line.<br />As far for this product the Bat Cowl was awesome to keep since im a huge collectible fan.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This is a beautifully written show! You go through all sorts of emotions and feelings towards the main characters, and they evolve in the most surprising of ways. Plus I love the foreshadowing within the episodes, good stuff!
B00BGI08GG|4.0|When I saw this trailer I was exited to see this on tv now that the first season end and finally having it is awesome. Smallville was an awesome tv show so picking up another new hero from dc was awesome since their movies in theaters are doing bad. I think Stephen Amell as Olive was perfect but his co-cast got some lack of acting but as the show moves on with different story i think the cast are getting more experience as it goes on.
B001DHXT20|3.0|The Hulk in The Avengers was a better character portrayal.  The hulk in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen was on par with this Hulk.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Alas, I can't get Netflix nor YouTube to stream to TV. Password matched, but tried to stream from my Kindle Fire (not HD) and an old laptop. maybe HD is required.
B003TNM2K6|4.0|I love Stephen King and this movie didn't disappoint. The ending is powerful with a statement that giving up hope is never justified. It also includes some stars that are more than familiar to me now on The Walking Dead series. Have a look, suspend disbelief, and enjoy!
B0001WGDX0|5.0|I picked this up on the recommendation of the author of<br />the 'NPR Curious Listener's Guide to Classical Music'<br />Solid recommendation to be sure. Can't go wrong with<br />Leonard Bernstein either.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Just as a good a read as its predecessors. The ending was much better than expected and better than the TV Series' ending.
B00499SA78|5.0|Mad Season is a mid 90's supergroup that contained members from Alice in Chains, Screaming Trees, and Pearl Jam. With that said you are probably already clicking this great album on the way to your house and about to witness some of the best music your ears have ever heard. This record was done shortly before lead singer Layne Staley \\"Alice in Chains\\" Death and seems to be an Audio Biography of the great singers life and struggles with addiction. Anyone that may have missed this material back in the 90's can get the rereleased copy [2013] with extra tracks and even a vinyl edition, do not miss out on a great record, buy today you will love it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|All of you haters hate on us do what ever you want WEST SIDE. I don't know what happened I tried it now i got my brother on it. Listen haters out there you think you bring it ,bring it but we ain't signing we bringing drama lump you and yo mother lumping mama .<br />Raynal
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Count the Emmy's and you will know how thoroughly entertaining this series is. There are too many stars to mention just a few. And I'm a guy!
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Very intricate stories that will keep the reader entertained all throughout the book.<br />This is definitely One of my favorite books.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I got it for my 13 year old daughter and it was all she could talk about for a while.<br /><br />I read it, and it was a fantastic book.  Great for &#34;children&#34; of all ages :-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game  with great details. Fun for all ages. Frequent updates to keep players happy and keep the game interesting.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I have watched season 2 and season 1 of Suits.  it's a great series.  I like the characters and how the writers have developed them.  The storyline is exciting and keeps you wanting to see what happens next.
B00AW57L96|4.0|I liked this book while some parts are predictable there is enough surprises to keep you reading right to the end
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Love this movie it will always be one of my favorites received movie fast and I'm enjoying it.... Brings back so many childhood memories
B00EOO55GW|4.0|As a long time AX7 fan I was honestly a bit disappointed, but that is primarily because their past albums have been so outstanding, a good one like this seems like a let down.  It is still a solid listen but seems a bit more vanilla than their past efforts.  A lot of songs sound similar, with the title track probably being the most enjoyable.
B00CLZ4B4I|2.0|just ok , now film can compare with the old ones like Wizard of OZ.  the whole film was a disappointment.  Just comparing it with wizard of oz was a mistake.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Hated this book.  Did not like the characters in the book and don't know why I read it all the way to the end.  It was recommended to me by someone who really liked it, but I didn't find it either interesting or worthwhile to read.  A friend of mine was reading it at the time that I was and she hated it too and wondered why she finished the book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I choose this rating because I liked the book<br />I like it because of the dance<br />I would recommend it to my parents
1416511946|5.0|This book is great, it makes me thankful for what I have.  Even if I don't have rockstar money.<br />Be aware that it is not for the faint of heart.  Many parts made me feel sick.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I downloaded the game app for my 8 yr old Grandsons as a reward for good behavior.  They have loved and laughed when playing the game and I am especially glad that it's content is a healthier option as games go.
1419705644|5.0|This is a must have for a lover of the antics of adventure time. This book includes nearly all of the facts you know and love about the show and many more you never even wanted to know! (I know you actually wanted to know them though..) written by the ruler of the nightosphere himself you learn things from on perspective, that of an evil ruler that barely likes anyone (but you still learn things)
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I do enjoy Michael Buble & his album choices.  Could he ever sing anything bad?  I will keep supporting good music.
1400052181|5.0|This book shipped quickly and NEW condition!  This was our first book club book and created a ton of conversation and was a great read that incorporates history and science and allowed for us to talk about our personal options on the subject.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This book gives a whole new meaning to honesty. It took you on unexpected twist and turns. I loved it
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Love the show!!! Keeps me wanting to see the next season. Season 1 captivates you...watching season 2 now. Great show.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I find this alarm very easy and intuitive.  I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone and prefer its use to that of other alarm apps - which I deleted as soon as I downloaded this device.
0385743564|3.0|I'm a Sanderson fan, but I think he might have created one of the most annoying supporting characters of all time with Cody. Once Cody starts talking you can bet that the (minimum) next 3 paragraphs of text will be an insipid exchange where southerner Cody pretends to be Scottish for no reason. Unfortunately Cody chooses to talk often, and usually during some fantastic action sequences. The effect is literary whiplash, going from a very readable and interesting description of what's happening to multiple-sentences of a hayseed being obnoxious to everyone's inexplicable delight. Eventually I just started scanning ahead whenever Cody had dialogue. It's that bad.<br /><br />Even the lead character suffers from an unfortunate dialogue-contrivance: he's terrible at making metaphors. And because the novel is told from a first-person perspective, this weakness turns into a constant stumbling block for the reader within the prose.<br /><br />Sanderson is a fantastic world-builder and his stories always play out in an immensely satisfying fashion, but Steelheart is actively made worse by its incredibly weak dialogue.
1400032717|5.0|The cover design couldn't have been more appropriate: after you read this moving novel, which takes you inside the mind of the main character with Asperger Syndrome, you start seeing the world upside down. The book is incredibly poignant and the central character endearing, in spite of all his flaws. The reader wants to root for him, even though we know that he could never root for us in a reciprocal way. Congratulations to the author for a superb job.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is amazing it is so fun to breed dragons and collect money and gems and my favorite dragon is the rainbow dragon and I don't know how people don't like it its amazing
B001O54NL2|2.0|I read at least one other review indicating this CD was remastered.  How would anyone know that?  Nevertheless, I don't think this CD is remastered.  My copy came with a Rhino Flashback sticker that says \\"Original Artists, Original Recordings\\"...translate Original = AAD = \\"...originally recorded on analog equipment...compact disc can reveal limitations of source tape\\".  That being said, I wish they would actually \\"remaster\\" this album since it's one of the best recordings ever made.
0062206281|3.0|Zafon's Shadow of the Wind & The Angel's Game blew me away.<br />I was expecting a book of the same caliber.<br />But was disappointed when it arrived. Not only is it MUCH thinner than the other 2, but the font is HUGE. Seems like he took a short story & tried to make a novel out of it.<br />Either he got greedy for money & sold out or there was a deadline he was working towards for his publisher.<br />However, Zafon still retains his love for literature & writing & it translates on the pages. That Gothic Barcelona style, which we all love, is still there
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Like wine, it needs a bit more time in the cask and should breathe prior to being consumed. All of the flavors of a good read were there, but the combination didn't quite work, and, as other reviewers have commented, there were some jarring instances that knocked me out of the feel-good place I'm usually in when I read one of Sanderson's works. I have faith that things will come together in the second book in this series.<br /><br />Without beating a dead-horse, the main character's narrative voice didn't resonate well with me. However, the strength of the action, the plot twists, and a likely trajectory toward understanding the \\"secret\\" behind why these Epics are so cantankerous (yeah, horrible word, I know) generally outweighed the weaknesses, and I really did enjoy the book, maybe even lost myself in it once or twice.
0143034901|5.0|I read this book for the first time a few years ago. I have re-read it about 5 or 6 times since then. I finally decided to get my own copy for my library b/c it's that good.<br />Carlos Ruiz Zafon is an extraordinary writer with meticulous attention to detail.<br />It's a pleasure to read this book. I felt like i never wanted it to end. Amazing story.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|plague inc. is a very fun and addicting game becuase your takeing over the world basily and your trying to infect everyone on the planet!
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Have to say I really loved this book.  I enjoyed the fact that Danny is getting his life together.  He's facing his demons, found good friends and a place to belong.  But don't get me wrong, this book is still scary.  I think it's a great sequel.  It certainly helps to know The Shining but the story still stands on its own legs. (Love to know what happens to Abra - maybe a sequel? )
B0019IB0II|5.0|I saw an interview with Jill Bolte Taylor on Super Soul Sunday and was fascinated by her experience as a stroke victim which is why I purchased the book.  She is obviously an absolutely brilliant woman to have become a Neuroanotomist twice!  I highly recommend that anyone who knows anyone that has had a stroke read this.  It gives you wonderful information (in layman terms) about how the brain works and is effected by a stroke as well as how to help a stroke victim.  I would hope that should I ever suffer from a stroke that ALL of my care takers read this book prior to attempting to be involved with my rehab in anyway!<br />This book will also help you to &#34;take charge&#34; of your brain and how you think about the world.  I highly recommend!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I absolutely love the play and LOVE the fact that it's a recorded version of the stage version. Got here the day after I ordered and have been in love with it ever since! 5 out of 5 stars!
B003YCIE68|4.0|It is a movie from my childhood- what is not to like?  I am so glad it is on DVD!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved this book...the whole trilogy was so good and so well written. Like the prices that Amazon offers on their books
0689835604|2.0|Was supposed to ship 2 day with a host of other times, including two other books, for a baby shower and I wanted to send favorite book from each of my children to new mom but this one book arrives 2 days late.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Great for a quick backgammon break, useful for teaching my kid backgammon since it shows all the legal moves. Easy to use on a phone, even with fat fingers.  No unnecessary permissions required.  We need more apps like this!  Highly recommended!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|With the Oklahoma weather so unpredictable having an accurate description and forecast right in your hands is invaluable.  Since I loaded the application I have used it at least three times a day.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|The first chapter was good but it wouldn't let me open chapter two on my Kindle Fire HD. I deleted it. Was glad I bought it with coins.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|This is the most original take on super heroes I've ever read. And, in true Sanderson fashion, the ending blew me away. I always have my theories and suspicions, but he always takes it somewhere fresh.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I never could get it to work on my Kindle Fire HD so deleted it. I was glad it was free so it was only a waste of a little of my time.
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|On the positive: this game is not bloated with hidden object searches.  There were some very interesting and fun mini-games.  Now the negative: it had fewer locations than typical for these types of games, not much difficulty in figuring out what gets used where, and much shorter play time.  For about double the average price I usually see.  If it were $2.99 rather than $4.99, I'd still think it a bit short, but wouldn't complain.  $1.99 would have gotten 5 star rating.
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|I'll make this short... I'm am (was) A Sting fan, and it's sad for me that I just can't get into this CD. It's just not what Sting is known for. Like many other reviewers said, this is more of a broadway show soundtrack. Like others, I made the mistake of buying before reviewing. MY BAD!!!
1592402038|4.0|I'll be honest, I am not the type to read a grammar book, and I sincerely hope I don't make any grammatical mistakes when reviewing one. I was assigned chapter three for a college writing class but am finding myself almost wanting to read more. I retained more from 30 pages of Truss' book than I ever did from a textbook, and I didn't even realize I was reading something educational most of the time. Though sometimes slow (this is a book about punctuation...) Truss incorporates a lot of humor into her writing. I was already familiar with most of the rules stated, but the history was surprisingly fun. Instead of being long, boring and dry like many history books, quick, funny anecdotes were used which kept my mind from wandering off topic.

B00DAPOHU6|4.0|Jack has a style. Don't expect him to do an R and B album or an album of house music. Not going to happen. The music is mellow and that's why I like it. I listen to it because I'm trying to unwind or need some music that's not going to get me all wound up while I listen to it. Oh and you don't need to be a stoner to enjoy this music. I get offended when people stereo type music or listeners of certain styles.
B00E5UEA4I|3.0|I really like KT Tunstall and I do like her quieter, acoustic type songs, but this is fairly bland. Pretty songs, but nothing that makes me go Wow.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|They draw influence from a lot of different styles and bring it all together while maintaining their sound that makes them unique. They are the sum of their parts. Listen to it and you'll hear what I'm talking about. They have brought together both of their respective bands and made a new family. This is the second album by this pairing. While they found their groove last time around this is more of the same. If you have the first one you'll like this one. If this is your first exposure to them pick up both of their back catalogs.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I am third generation Irish.  My ancestors came to the U.S. (through Canada) to keep from starving.  I have read many books about the starvation in Ireland and the terrible trips across the Atlantic.  I know that many parents died in the crossing. I am sure that they went many different directions but I never knew about the orphan trains until now.<br /><br />What a womderful story told beautifully, although the horror in it, also perfectly described renched my Irish soul.  I felt that I was going through what Vivian was going through.<br /><br />An amazingly wonderful book;  I purchased it for my kindle but I will now buy the hard cover.  It will make a great addition to my library/<br /><br />Well done, Christina, very well done indeed.<br /><br />Michael Jon Daley<br />Lebanon, Pa

0525478817|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable book although that is hard to say considering the subject matter. I can honestly say I lost sleep since I had to see what was going to happen and could not put the book down unlike many books lately where I skim to finish & be done with it, I savored every word. It was funny & sad, philosophical, irreverent, but most of all interesting.Favorite quote, \\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world, old man, but you do have some say in who hurts you.\\" True, read for yourself and decide.

B00CL0J99K|4.0|While not quite up to the level of the first movie, this one was definitely better than Iron Man 2. It showed that Tony Stark is the most powerful component in the technological superhero Iron Man, not the technology.  I liked it quite a bit.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I give this a five star rating because I am enjoying reading this book very much.. Great read for the price!

B0012GTZC0|4.0|Always find Ken Follett  books to be fun reads . He has a greater way  of weaving history in to fiction
0064471837|5.0|Although I loved all 3 books, this was my favorite. Precisely because of the Sabriel character. The book also draws the reader into the Old Kingdom, the realm of death and the role of the Abhorsen. I love fantasy, but the books that I love are few. It's rare that a story draws me in as quickly as this. Sabriel shares rich character development and the antagonist character(s) are an interesting twist on zombies. A great read; I'm looking forward to more.
B00CEJ2E4A|5.0|This review is for the Metal Blade pressing from Germany, NOT the US picture disc. This is for the limited edition, 180 gram 1 LP pressing.<br /><br />I am incredibly impressed by this pressing. Firstly, it sounds amazing. If you like the album, then this is the best presentation of it that I have heard (I have the CD also). Secondly, the packing is incredible. Very heavy-duty gatefold that is extremely well-done. The poster could be on a little thicker paper, but it's still a great edition to this amazing album.<br /><br />If you're searching for the best edition of this album, look no further. Buy the 180 gram German Metal Blade pressing, either black or blue LP. I haven't heard how the picture disc sounds, but picture discs are notoriously horrid sounding and are more a collectors type of thing.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We've seen the first and second seasons and avidly waiting to see how everything pans out - is there a Season four in the Pipeline ?
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|This is a Dream Theater release so it automatically gets at least 4 stars because of the level of musicianship. I think they have become much more of a Progressive Rock band than Prog Metal.  Portnoy was always the most Metal thing about them and MM is a lot more Bill Bruford than Portnoy.<br /><br />As always this band blows me away when they go into an extended instrumental break.  Each instrumental part is played at the highest level and they always fit together.  Both Petrucci and Rudness are just amazing technically and the arrangements highlight their abilities.  Mike Mangini and John are both top tier players and their playing always both supports and adds to the tightness and power of this band.  At times in the past I think James vocals have been a little shrill and strained.  This is the best I've heard him sound in a long time.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 because there isn't much about the material that I thought deserved a five. I don't like the songwriting as much as I liked it on Six Degrees or Scenes but that's probably because this prog guy has always loved it when a band finds a theme and executes it brilliantly.<br /><br />If you are a fan you probably already own this and have your own opinion.  If you are on the fence and can't decide then go get it.  There is enough instrumental brilliance to satisfy you even if you aren't thrilled with the material.<br /><br />I looked through the already published reviews and have two conclusions.<br /><br />First - If the reviewer is a Portnoy fan or more of a metal fan than a Progressive rock fan then they are much more likely to think less of this album.<br /><br />Second - Dream Theater fans are passionate and devoted to a fault.  They also have a tendency to attack when they feel that the band has gone in a direction they don't like.  After getting a few comments about my conclusion that the complaints about recording quality were unjustified I listened to a couple of the different mix tracks and now agree the quality on the CD could be better.  However I still believe the quality of the CD is good enough to let the ability of the band come through.<br /><br />Third - \\"Along For The Ride\\" is a great track and I appreciate it more every time I listen to it.<br /><br />I wish that all the fans would allow each release to rise and fall on it's own merits.  Every band will evolve and lose some fans and if you don't like the current approach then you should listen to something else.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I am a long time Marc Anthony fan. He delivered a great albun. Of course<br />I would recomend this album
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game overall it pretty fun. The music can sometimes get a little annoying but I can fix it just by turning down the volume.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|By far one of the greatest movies that I've seen Clint Eastwood in. Definitely a movie that you can enjoy over and over and over.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I love all his books, including this one.  He gets pretty technical and there's really not a cohesive flow, but the information inside is gold
B0035HKWM6|5.0|One of my favorite Jim Carrey films. I even like Cameron Diaz  in this (when she looked like a real person and not a boney rendition of the joker).
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Interesting continuation of Scarpetta series.  Kay is older, more worried, less bold, but good at sorting out the facts from the detris.  Relationships are strained with no resolution.  Boston seems harsh in this narrative.
B0019IIPXQ|3.0|great filming location (in the Australian desert --cool!), OK acting for most actors, but a rather simplistic story line. Vin Diesel and Cole Hauser were great, though.
B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|When I went to the theater and saw this movie I was very skeptical. There have been so many movies that the funniest parts are shown in the advertisement for the movie but NOT this movie. I laughed so hard most of the way through this movie. When I got home I told my husband about it and the next week he and I and a friend went and saw it again. All three of us loved this movie. It is hilarious. I cannot wait for my copy of it so I can watch it whenever I need a good laugh!
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because: 1. I love a good gangster flick, 2. I love a good L.A. noir flick, and 3. The cast is top notch.<br /><br />However, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this film to anyone who holds filmmaking, acting, or storytelling in high regard. The movie feels like a bunch of high-caliber actors were given a really weak script, and the director, given this much talent and this flimsy of a story, really had no direction, no singular point of view. It's all very jumbled and not very compelling. The acting is bad, overacted in order to compensate for the weak material, and the dialogue is just ridiculous.<br /><br />&#34;Gangster Squad&#34; is violent, I'll give it that. I'm usually not that off-put by violence so long as it is in service to the story, see &#34;Boardwalk Empire,&#34; &#34;The Departed,&#34; etc. However, given that I couldn't care less about the story or the characters, the violence seemed gratuitous.<br /><br />My advice: skip this and watch almost any other gangster or film noir movie and definitely watch &#34;Boardwalk Empire.&#34;
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|The banter! The writers must have a great time with the banter!  If you haven't seen this series, do watch it!
B00EEDJHXA|5.0|Awesome, addicting, fun game.  Keeps my mind busy.  Makes me think ahead and plan.  Didn't think I would ever purchase a game on line.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super fun game had a great time playing it kept me busy for hours figuring out the different rooms I would recommend it to others!
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|I've seen this movie a half a dozen times and it's funny every time! It is definitely in my top 5 movies!
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I have read all of the books in this series, and most of the other Grisham books. I have seen several reviews that  said this and the others in the series were unbelievable and kids don't talk and act like the kids in this book. Let me say, from not only having kids that were this age, to having been a middle school teacher, to having been involved in Scouting for many years, to having my children come to my office at times - I can say that kids are absolutely like the kids in the book.  I will also  say that I found myself slipping back to my own years of that age... and if nothing else, that is a good reason to read the book.  All of the Grisham books don't have to be legal thrillers.  It is just another avenue, but people do the same thing in his books.... they read to escape, to get a diversion, to see someone else's problems, etc.  This book and the series will do that for you. In the end, How many can honestly say that at some point they haven't told one of those &#34;back when I was in High School stories&#34; or told their kids: &#34; You don't know what it is really like to have to....&#34; For that alone, read and enjoy and go back to your own childhood, and be reminded that it wasn't always as good as you remember now. Become a kid again for a bit, let things go and feel better.
B003VANOFY|1.0|The title pretty much sums it up - this is a very well built headset that is backed up by terrible software support and a ridicilous amount of conflicts. Before I could even use it, I had to completely remove any trace of my motherboard sound drivers. And that's just the start. I think I have over 10 different versions of logitech software on my pc right now and they all have different pros and cons. On one version the headset connects and is recognized by Windows right away, but you cannot enter the settings menu or use the voice changer tool, on another version it takes up to 15 minutes for Windows to pick up the headset and allow you to use it, but you can enter the settings etc. You get the point. The newest development, unfortunately after a quick google search I found out I'm not the only one to suffer from it, is a strong scratching sound that comes from the headset. Fortunately, for me it repaired itself on its own, but the google search showed a lot of different cases, one person actually claimed that his headset's battery got fried because he was using the headset while it was charging!?<br /><br />My only advice to you is to google this headset extensively and focus on people reporting its malfunctions.<br /><br />However, I have also encountered numerous users that claim that they have no issues at all with their headset, so it's basically pure luck whether you'll end up with a 100% working headset or an extensively flawed one.<br /><br />I for my part know that I will never buy another Logitech product again. Even 6 months after i purchased the headset, Logitech still continues to make a mess of the software support, and not only in regards to this headset, but also a G700 mouse that I also own.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I connected this device to my TV and followed the on screen instructions.<br />I connected it to my laptop fine, but with my cell phone it kept saying connection failed try to recast.<br />After several tries it still will not work properly.<br />I finally gave up with the cell phone and just used my laptop.<br />The device is so limited in what it will do that it's not even worth the $35.<br />Sent it back for a refund.<br />I'll try something else.

B00DURHYWC|5.0|\\"What'll I Do\\" was my mother and father's song - hearing China sing it is one of many highlights.  I'm a sucker for \\"Get Happy/Happy Days Are Here Again\\" - China and Rufus do a lovely job (don't waste your time comparing them with Judy & Barbra, just sit back and enjoy).  I saw a clip of Thomas with Phyllis Diller right after the legendary comic died.  This is a perfect tribute - Phyllis singing \\"Smile.\\"  From the opening number \\"Ich Dich Liebe\\" I knew this was going to be a very special CD.  I'm one of those people/listeners who likes to save the CD to my computer and then mix and match songs from all their CDs - I've got a lot to add thanks to this great new disc.
B000I186FW|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie it was a look at what could happen if people sacrifice freedom for what they perceive to be safety. But I believe that this is a far cry from what America's government is and I cant help but think that those who have reviewed this film are paranoid about big government. In the U.S government is no where near as being evil and controlling. Now a days the threat is different there are nukes and biological weapons therefore we must give up a certain amount of \\"personal freedom\\" for our safety but we do that with haste and with restraints, the way our government system works a dictatorship wouldnt be able to take place. I just wish people were able to educate themselves with out being controlled by conspiracy theories.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Subject says it all. When I see the absolute drivel that gets three stars from Amazon (who rates them?) when Rotten Tomatoes gives it 67% and the audience gives it 75% I'm left scratching my head. Any help would be appreciated.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|This book was definitely pushed to its limits and stretched too thin.  I did enjoy this \\"novel\\".  However, the character didn't grow or become anything more than what he was at the beginning.  He did make some observations that were some food for thought, but in the end he never came to a conclusion on how he was going to grow or change.<br /><br />Overall, rent from the library you might not get your monies worth.

B00DT99BX6|4.0|Pawn of Innocence is a story of discovery, love and finding your own place in the world. It centres around Camille. A young woman who has everything she could possibly ask for. The only problem is her father. Due to a tragedy that took her mother's life. Camille's father isn't taking any chances with the thing he values most. She is forever watched by bodyguards. As a way to deal with this claustrophobic surveillance, Camille escapes on breaks abroad. Challenging her father's intentions and authority. But little does she realise her father has good cause to fear for her safety. On a trip away everything changes for Camille. She not only finds herself falling in love but running from danger. Unfortunately for Camille danger and love seem to go hand in hand.<br /><br />Pawn of Innocence is a good and enjoyable read. Though the beginning was a little slow, I did not think this affected the story as I enjoyed getting to know the tenacious Camille and her family and friends. For a winter read, this is the book. Filled with wonderful locations, you can easily imagine the rich world Camille inhabits. A world which is helped along with a Sights and Sounds feature. I'd never come across this before. It was an interesting addition.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|What happened to Danny?  And now I know and I'm pleased with that knowledge. I've always really liked Stephen King and think he gets less recognition than he deserves.

B001EBWING|5.0|An exotic setting during World War II is the backdrop for a complicated love story, European politics, and a complicated character played by Bogart. The soundtrack includes &#34;As Time Goes By&#34;. I have seen it several times and will watch it again: &#34;Play it again Sam&#34;.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I am writing this review to rehash what others have said regarding the sound cutting out. This is very true and very big problem with the headset. Every few minutes or so, the power/connection will fail and you'll hear a very distinct beeping following the sound cutting out. Then after a couple seconds it will come back on, but this is extremely annoying and you are always just waiting for it to happen again! I would not recommend this headset. This problem is not fixable, despite all the effort and troubleshooting that I've put into it. Just buy yourself a pair of wired headphones and alleviate this annoyance.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my second book by this author - the first being &#34;What Alice Forgot&#34;.  It was very different from the novels I usually read - less depth and complexity - but her writing skills are commendable.  She did a wonderful job of telling the story and making each of the characters complete and believable.  It spite of its limitations, it kept me turning the page.

0345803507|2.0|11/12 - Overall this trilogy has left me feeling disturbed and weirdly guilty. The first book was definitely the worst - in some parts disgusting and others scary and rage inducing. The second was considerably improved, going from a 1 to a 3 star rating. I didn't feel the need for an urgent mind shower to wash some of the images out of my head after reading it. This one would probably get 2.5 stars if the half star was available. There were some disturbing scenes that are seared into my brain and keep popping into my mind during everyday activities; and there was some romance and a happy, if unlikely, ending. I haven't been this unnerved and distracted by a book since I read my first romance at the age of 12 (btw that was an Avon historical romance written in the 80s). Regarding the happy ending I don't see how Christian and Ana can sustain their lifestyle with multiple children getting in the way, and into rooms they're not supposed to be in. The constant repetition of phrases by both Ana and Christian got really old, really fast. How many times can she say \\"Oh, Christian.\\", how many times can he say \\"Fair point well made.\\" before the reader can be expected to get bored and give up? I'm glad that Ana finally started to stand up for herself, but at the same time I spent most of the book angry with her constant need to defy him. Does she enjoy feeling terror from the reaction of her husband to her errant ways? I was also pleased that she was able to become more accustomed to Christian's wealth. The whole way through the previous books I kept thinking 'What's wrong with this woman?' If I was her I would be eagerly accepting any insanely expensive luxury he was willing to lavish on me and asking 'Can I have some more?' As another reviewer mentioned, I was surprised that their baby wasn't born brain damaged after all the drinking she did and then practically being kicked in the head by Hyde. If James were to do a fourth book in the series I think it should be set 10 years in the future so we can see how the BDSM lifestyle fits in with curious nearly teenagers running around the house investigating everything and demanding their parents' attention at all hours.rs in the future so we can see how the BDSM lifestyle fits in with curious nearly teenagers running around the house investigating everything and demanding their parents' attention at all hours.
B00E66QPCG|5.0|I initially had some doubts about buying this book as it only had 21 pages!<br /><br />Thank goodness that I did, as every page is worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />Once again, a great book that is clear, concise and very easy to read! I hope you find it as useful and helpful as I did.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shining and I love this book.  Danny Torrence is a unique, and beloved character.  No one does is better than King!
1400069742|5.0|This is a book about the United States in the three years before World War II.  The country was split between \\"isolationists\\", who wanted to stay out of the war in Europe and \\"interventionists\\" who wanted to fight Hitler.  I started reading the book because The Economist mentioned it in an article about America's ambivalence towards punishing Syria for using poison gas.<br /><br />This was a book which I had trouble putting down.  I feared reaching the end of it, and was saddened when I did.<br /><br />Before reading it I knew the general the outlines of the story, how Roosevelt was hampered by the ambivalence of the country, how, as Great Britain was on the point of losing the war, he inched slowly towards helping her with symbolic and timid policies, how the size of America's army ranked 17th in the world, how the air force consisted of a few hundred obsolescent airplanes, how the navy was concentrated in the Pacific and unprepared to fight on two fronts, and how, as Germany had conquered most of Europe and was destroying London, an extension of the draft passed the US Senate by only one vote.  And I knew how this uncertainty ended when, as Dean Acheson put it \\"at last our enemies with unparalleled stupidity, resolved our dilemmas...\\"  by bombing of Pearl Harbor and by the German declaration of war on the United States three days later.<br /><br />While I knew the general outlines of the story, I did not know the details.  The culture wars of the per-war period, which bear some  resemblance to our current ones, stemmed from the acrimony of the Great Depression and the New Deal.  Roosevelt's uncharacteristic timidity stemmed from the defeat of his plans to pack the Supreme Court.  The general reluctance to go to war was a result of the failure of the Great War to end all wars and the subsequent conspiracy theories, false but much believed, that the British and the armament manufacturers had tricked us into going into that war.<br /><br />Another gripping thing about this book is the sympathetic biographies which interlace the main narrative, among them biographies of Wendell Willkie and Charles and Anne Lindbergh.  No one who reads this book will ever forget the portraits of Charles Lindbergh and his wife Anne.  Charles Lindbergh was alternately glorified and vilified by his countrymen, and deserved both.  His story, one of the most bizarre in American history, has an ending which, if you don't know it already, will leave you with your mouth open.  But don't go to Wikipedia and find out what it is.  Read this book and get the plot in its proper sequence.  His wife Anne and her conflicted feelings for her famous husband, and her ultimate resolution of them, is another story which you will not easily forget.  I fell in love I her.<br /><br />Like many others, I thought of Roosevelt as a supremely wise and able leader, who got us out of the worst of the depression, and would have gotten us out altogether if not constantly harassed by selfish opponents, and who galvanized us and led us to victory in World War II.  This is all true, but during the period of this book, he was indecisive and timid, unable to lead even when there was much evidence that most people would have followed.  He almost allowed Germany to defeat Britain.  This would have left an unprepared America to stand alone against a European superpower which also controlled the Middle East and whose ally, Japan, controlled Asia.<br /><br />As Acheson said, only the unparalleled stupidity of the Japanese leaders and Hitler gave the allies ultimate victory.  But the corollary of this is that these stupid and fatal decisions were made in dictatorial states, whereas in the United States the decisions, however confused and slow, were made by the entire population, in countless open debates in countless democratic ways.  The People may have vacillated, but they did not do anything as stupid and suicidal as the dictators did.ave vacillated, but they did not do anything as stupid and suicidal as the dictators did.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book.  Believe all of the reviews you've read. I hated to put it down.  This is great writing not anything like the mediocre writing you see in some of the &#34;popular&#34; books.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I typically do not read this type of genre however, after reading the reviews I chose to dwell into the realm of fiction. I purchased the Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5) (Silo Saga) [Kindle Edition]. Once I began reading I was hooked!  In less than a week I had all five read and ordered the 6th installment in the Silo Saga.  For someone who generally reads American History, World History, Military History, and Historical Fiction, the characters enthralled me and I could not wait to see what would happen to the characters within the story.  Great book! I am very glad that I found this author and looking forward to reading more of his works.  Keep it up!
B007G92QGO|4.0|Phew.  This book really tests your reaction as to whether you feel the teenage Jacob could be a killer.  It's a real \\"yes he did\\", \\"no he didn't\\" story.  I didn't feel sorry for Jacob who is not a particularly likable character (which doesn't mean he's a murderer).  But I did feel sorry for both parents and could understand the pressure they were under when their only son is accused of such a terrible and cruel murder.  The story holds your interest til the end and is worth reading.
B008I34ZFW|3.0|If you are expecting this Nazis on the Moon story to be science fiction, you will be sorely disappointed. However, if you like oddball comedy, you may be looking at the right film. There are pseudo-science-fictional elements to this over the top farce, but they are merely window dressing. Don't try to take it seriously, and you might enjoy the humor.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This zombie book had an ending, not like others.  I enjoyed house the stories were written.  I recommend this book to any zombie fanatic.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|This is one of the best movie's that Paul Newman maded and I just had to have it. I have others but I love this one the most.
B0012UNWJ8|5.0|This kid is every parents dream child. And the expressions on him are portrayed with perfection. The acting of the kid portraying Josh  is so strong that everyone else is turned into sock puppets. Ben Kingsley's acting was good also but his character's tremendous potential was not fully developed. There was a back story wanting to be told.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I love Bruse Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did a great job. I love Syfy movies and this one was a good one the ending is a big surprise. I did not see it coming out the was it did.
B00EV4EUT8|3.0|I wasn't sure what to expect and will need to see it again, but I personally had trouble forgetting I was seeing Oprah, Forest, Terrance etc.  Because of the scene jumps for the history factor I just didn't connect as a whole.  I felt something was missing but for sure the story itself over ride the presentation.  It is a story that had to be told and glad it was.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Quick read, good mix, started slow for me but kept my interest.  Surprise plots you didn't see coming, was a little disappointed with the<br />end wrap up...  still worth reading...
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It's super easy to use. It's fun and easy to learn! There are only a few languages to learn though. I would love fir it to come out  in Chinese!
B00594XOZU|2.0|When I first got it, it was great. The first time that I logged out of it, it won't let me back in.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book indeed....On to book two! I could not put it down. Very good book especially if your not a big reader!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I get to compete against other people and have fun.  I like the different levels of the games.  It can be a lot of fun using the power-ups.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I couldn't beat the price but haven't had the time to read it yet. I am looking forward to it as Stephen king does nothing partly!

B001L5YW9I|4.0|The Last of the Mohicans is a well done movie adaptation of the book of the same name.  It is an artistic telling of war.  Every scene, every camera angle, every motion is well thought-designed to be a moving portrait.  Its costumes and cast is a perfect selection.<br /><br />The movie's score is outstanding.  However, the story moves at a pace which is a bit slow.  When this classic tale is brought to the screen again it should be a bit quicker.
B000TYV3C6|2.0|Three Spider-Man films are on 4 discs in this 2007 collection. Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst star in this adaptation of the famous comic book. Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio is superb. The major problem is that Sony has dropped all supplements from Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2 (hang onto the DVDs which were loaded with bonus content). However, all the extras from Spider-Man 3 are here on the bonus disc. There is over 2 hours of total bonus content provided which is light treatment for a 3-film collection.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1<br />Audio Formats: English PCM 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-Bit/6.9mbps), English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 Surround (48kHz/24-bit), French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Portuguese Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, Thai Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, English Subtitles, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles, Portuguese Subtitles, Korean Subtitles, Thai Subtitles<br />Special Features: Audio Commentaries, Featurettes, Deleted Scenes, TV Spots<br /><br />These are 4 star films in a 2 star package. It's shocking Sony hasn't released a package with the new Amazing Spider-Man but it will likely come out soon (hopefully with deluxe bonus content for all the films). You are better off buying the stand-alone Blu-ray releases for the Spider-Man films. This release has managed to hold its value for the time being.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is DT going back to their roots , so powerfull and full of emotion ! At least we can finaly ear the great John Myung on the bass ! Yes alot of passage reminds me the music of RUSH . Everybody is shining on this one especially James Labrie on illumination theorie ... You can't go wrong with this on !!!
B0002NRQTS|5.0|There is indeed an improved sound over the original release of Presto. There is increased bass and a lowering of those screeching highs from the first time around. This is my favorite Rush album after Moving Pictures. Almost every track clicks and this disc started a movement away from the overkill of synthesizer on previous releases. Rush waved their magic wand and it shows with a killer album.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I couldn't put this story down. The characters were compelling & lovable.  The story was well written as well as difficult to comprehend at times because of the horrific abuse suffered at the hands of the clergy. I greatly admired the loving patience Jamie had in his friends.  I look forward to other works from Christina McKenna.  Stephanie
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I thought I'd like it more on someone's recommendation, didn't the first time I watched it, but watched again a few weeks later & liked it a lot more. Never had that happen before, odd...
B008P1EWIM|1.0|Same as the free version. Did not have what it said it did. tried different things to get it to work. I wish I could get my 199 amazon coins back.

B00936A2SM|3.0|Specifically Scott! I'd buy into anything that dares to reappraise the rep of the almighty Weather Report. And, as such, here we are then: Zawinul seems adequately attributed to, and understandably so, all things considered [and I absolutely love Scott Henderson's solo on \\"Two Lines\\" as so integral to - The Zawinul Syndicate live release of 2005 \\"Vienna Nights\\"; which I mention at this point just in case to-whom-it-may-concern, in-syndication-of, might mistake me for some sort of '\\"clueless\\" -fan\\"' of the current HBC-incorporate ...]. Joe Zawinul was a great MD! Scott obviously misses Zawinul's great directorship. We all do! Scott Henderson needed him .... But one thing that I specifically remember about the original recording[s] of Weather Report's \\"Two Lines\\" is the sparse, spare percussion section of the enigmatic Wayne Shorter [salsa-on-a seashell, specifically Scott], ostensibly additional, if minimal at the variously protracted intros with: LOTS-OF-SPACE - Dear Scott: digging a critical hole for oneself isn't quite the same thing as creating an audio aperture on the stand. Partly, it's the-reactive-over-the-creative way to defensively go about incorporating the overall neurosis that is FUSION! It's tough, but Weather Report were not a fusion band; there can be no progressive fusion-fashioned, tribute-bands to that end in any case. Fusion bands are by their very nature tribute bands, in stasis. And, you're standing on the shoulders of giants at this point as to try it on as a guitar [albeit well balanced] trio. There was an axis, there - HBC just glibly pissed specifically, all over it, Scott.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I did not know that you could get this free at first!  I was so happy when I fond out that it was free! I think a lot of people like this game lima.I do!!!!!!
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|Does what is should. Glad I can have an app that actually cleans my hardware of catches and crap. Couple words left glad I can hep you. 3 stars for icon. Ugly
B00D6DVSAE|2.0|Has &#34; jumped the shark.&#34; Unfortunately in every artists career there is a peak. I think Sting  reached and descended from that peak after Brand New Day.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Pros: Minion animation & sounds is really good.<br />Cons: game has no objectives, poor idea and is stupid, just timekiller.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|It's the best backgammon app out there. My favorite game. I just love it. You should definitely give it a try.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I have heard of the Orphan Trains that brought so many orphan, deserted or otherwise parentless children to the mid west for adoption.  Many stories are uplifting. Many are tragic. This well written fascinating book tells the story or an Irish 9 year old girl and some of her fellow travelers through her life story.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|Mesmerizing intertwining of various people's lives and personalities. Leaves you feeling satisfied, contemplative, and smiling. Doesn't try to polish the realities of human nature.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I've read this book twice now and found it so moving each time.  Must watch the Pacific DVDs as well to get the full experience.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I rather enjoyed this movie. However, it was hard to not compare it to the original Wrath of Khan. I know they are two separate movies, but I couldn't help but feel as though this Khan wasn't as cerebral as the original. Still an excellent movie. Would watch again, again, and again.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|This is a very bad game because, when your buying stuff on the game like with your tokens you are actually buying  it and it charges you! I had to erase the game. I loved this game but it's a rip off. !
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Maybe I didn't research well enough and/or read the description wrong but I was under the impression the chromecast will work using a cell phone's 3G/4G but it will NOT.  You need a secure WiFi connection and the WiFi at most hotels won't work either.  The appeal, for me, of the chromecast is that it is smaller than a ROKU which would make it better for traveling but since it won't work with 3G/4G or hotel WiFi the travel option is out.  It is more difficult to set up then the ROKU, offers less options, has reception issues because it plugs in behind the TV and it's only $15 less than the ROKU 2.  If, like me, you were looking for something to use while traveling do some research before purchasing because the chromecast is not the answer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love these books!!! Everyone will love them!! A must read whenever ever and whenever you want!! Can't wait for the movie
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is the app that everyone likes to go to when I let someone play on my kindle, the only problem is it won't update sooner!
B00005JKHN|5.0|I haven't watched this movie for decades and I think I enjoyed it more than my daughter.  It was like watching it for the first time for me. I have to say that the evil queen is the most villanous of all of the villanesses in the Disney movies...very scary, frightened my daughter some until she cuddled up with me.
B00F2LIV4E|4.0|A solid release but not a whole lot of kick. Seems like they are doing what Rush did and consolidating their sound.
B00APJLY0Q|2.0|I watched this movie as I'm all about Halloween year round. It is predictable as expected but good story, good characters, and was fun to watch. HOWEVER, the music at the end absolutely and completely ruined it for me. I do not believe for a second that ANY of those characters would sing that type of music with that type of voice. It saddens me that the music industry force feeds us this talentless mindless crap. There is a world of great music that is our there but unfortunately most people will never get to hear it. When this first popped out on DVD I almost bought it outright on the cover alone. Thank the gods for Red Box! I'd recommend renting it for the $1, but you'll need to hit mute near the end. You'll know the time!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My son loves horses when I saw this app I had to get it for him Awesome app me and my son are addicted :)
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this game! I can't stop playing.  Very entertaining and highly addictive.  I just wish that you could buy more costumes with bananas instead of tokens or use your bananas to purchase gru's tokens.  LOVE IT!!!<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW - DECEMBER 17, 2013<br />Okay, not loving the Christmas update!  I can't even get the game to open, it crashes every time.  They need to fix the update and soon!!!  Until the update is fixed, this is done to one star.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My sister-in-law got me started on it now I can't stop watching it. I like to see the architecture and furniture. I try to decorate my home the same way.
B00514HDNW|4.0|I Am Legend.  After reading the book, now I see why people got so annoyed at the movie.  They are COMPLETELY different.  Though, I'm not one to get too upset by such things myself,  I do get why other people might have been upset by the liberties the movie took.  Anyways, that being said, I liked this book.  I didn't think I was going to at first though.  In my opinion, this book took a very long time to get moving with any substantial plot or action.  I appreciate that they wanted to set the tone and the mood of the world for the reader, but if I remember correctly, it's like 9 chapters into the book before the word Vampire is even mentioned.  I almost gave up several times.  The only reason I stuck with it was that for years I'd heard how good the book was from various people.  Luckily, once the book gets rolling it's quite entertaining, and pretty much maintains that pace throughout.  With the exception of a few out dated (and potentially offensive, if you are sensitive)  references to African Americans, this book reads well for a novel written over 30 years ago.  Lots of action and lots of interesting characters.  Certainly ended up being worth the read.
1613771355|4.0|I bought this for my fiance because she's ALL into this cartoon.  The story for her goes that she had the VHS and wore it out watching it over and over.  The graphic novel is AWESOME.  IDW does a great job with their art and artists.  Very much worth full price.
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|An excellent album with 2 or 3 oustanding songs (being the. Looking Glass the best song here), no fan of the ballads in this album but the rest of the songs make a good balance between heavy and enjoyable good prog songs..glad to hear again Myung  bass in several passages , above all in the instrumental Enigma Machine.
0060730552|5.0|Those of us who find pleasure in placing our lives in jeopardy and those of us who do not nevertheless have one thing in common--we will all at one time or another have to face our own mortality. At some unexpected moment the Reaper (as Carlos Casteneda explained it) will tap us on the shoulder and we will be told to follow him into the abyss. Most wil do as they are told. Select others will refuse the Reapers' bidding and miraculously escape his clutches delaying the inevitable for another day. Simpson was one of these--a man who escaped by the thinnest of margins. There have been many others--all their stories equally compelling. Their only ditinguishing feature is in how their stories were told--and this one was told well!<br /><br />DH Koester--\\"And There I Was\\" [[ASIN:B009VNN27A And There I Was, Volume I: A Backpacking Adventure In Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia]]
1250030951|5.0|**possible spoiler alert**<br /><br />This book is FANtastic. I managed to snag a copy at this year's BEA, and once I heard about it, I knew I had to read it right away. This book basically details my life, assuming I had a twin sister and divorced parents and lived in Nebraska. No, but the whole thing about how the main character is obsessed with fanfiction to the extent of sort of letting life pass her by...that's me. That's my life. In fact as I write this review I have a fic open in another tab.<br /><br />This book is about Cath and how much her life changes during her freshman year at college -- away from her father (who is bipolar, I think) and her twin sister -- and how she clings to the fictional world of Simon Snow (who bears a striking resemblance to another teenage wizard) in order to escape from life. Cath's story is interspersed with excerpts from Simon Snow, either the \\"actual\\" books or Cath's fanfiction, and it's almost like having another story inside this one.<br /><br />The characters are realistic. They're flawed and fleshed out. Cath deals with change by withdrawing into the world of Simon Snow while her twin sister Wren chooses to act out. At times I felt like there was a little too much going on. In addition to Wren pulling away from her and her father's downward spiral, Cath has to deal with her feelings for her roommate's ex Levi, her story-stealing creative writing partner Nick, and her absent mother's sudden return. It feels like some of the subplots didn't get the attention they should have because there was so much. But I guess there are times in real life when it seems like everything goes wrong at once.<br /><br />I don't tend to be very good at reviews. I like what I like because I like it, and I've never been able to adequately articulate why. I liked this book. I really liked this book. I think anyone who has ever been massively involved in fandom -- any fandom, for anything -- will like this book. It's such an accurate portrayal ofwhat it's like to be overly-involved in the lives of fictional characters, and I think anyone who knows what that is like will see a little bit (or a lot of) themselves in Cath
B007J4T2G8|1.0|By now I'm sure almost everyone in the world has heard of these books.  Everyone was spot on about how much &#34;X&#34; rated content was in it.  I was just slightly surprised at how terrible the writing was, when so many people have said such good things about the book! I guess if you are looking to read porn, this is the book for you.  If you want to feel somewhat smart and educated, don't read it!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I love this show. Was skeptical at first. But i was hooked after the first episode. Tatiana Maslany makes this show. She is prob one of the best actresses ive ever seen.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|the long awaited CD is here..<br />strong energized and wonderful. fantastic Cher.. great job..<br />all the songs are perfect in my opinion, looking forward to the upcoming tour..
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book kept my interest from the very beginning to the end. I loved the character of Vivian. Your book as wonderful
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I wish there were more than just 8 episodes per season; but I suppose that just keeps you coming back for more.  I wind up speaking with a British accent after watching these again and again.  The best part is the high-brow humor and the cattiness between the characters.  It's amazing that they can all stay in the same house and remain (somewhat) civil (relatively speaking).  Try it, you'll be hooked from the first episode.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I found myself cheering and cheering, catching my breath, surprised several times, cheering again. I am left feeling WOW! Justice was served,dam! Who else saw this movie and felt the same way? Thank you for great entertainment!
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|We should all be weary of M night movies.  Poorly directed but had a lot of potential.  M. Night isn't a feature film director.
B005USZYDU|5.0|PERFECT FOR INTELLIGENT KIDS OVER AGE TEN AND ADULTS WHO ENJOY ANY GRISHAM TYPE BOOKS.  IT SHOULD BECOME THE FIRST OF A LONG SERIES OF THEODORE BOONE STORIES.  I HAVE JUST LOANED MY KINDLE FIRE TO MY 10 YEAR OLD GRANDSON SO HE CAN READ IT.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was amazing!  I rarely laugh out loud or cry when reading books, but with this I did both!
B006CHML4I|5.0|Large, clunky watches have been in for some time,, and it's hard to find a watch that is both elegant and rugged.  This Seiko does just that, with its beautiful, bold blue military-style face and matching blue band.  If you are looking for a mechanical movement, I cannot imagine a watch at this low price point that looks this good.  I really like the unique face with the minutes outside and the hour circle within - just different enough to be interesting.  That said, there are a couple of disadvantages.  First, there is no way to wind the watch - it winds through the automatic mechanism only.  If you want to keep the watch going without wearing it, you will have to move it enough without keep it wound.  Taking the watch off and swinging it in a few small circles goes a long way in keeping it ticking 24/7.  Second, the crown is unusually hard to grasp and lift from the watch, requiring some serious fingernail action.  But in all, it's a great watch, a real looker, and worth much more than  what you will pay for it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was a wonderful story. I wa instantly pulled in by the older woman's story! Overall a great read!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really fun game, I've been playing it for a while and I'm still not tired of it, just have to finish those missions.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Just got an account on Duolingo: Learn Laguages Free. I am very impressed, let me just say that. The Kindle Fire app is amazing! It runs very quickly and it is overall a helpful learning tool. Once in a while it will glitch out for a few seconds, but it doesn't run like that regualarly. If you want to learn a laguage and you already have a basic knowledge of the langauge you are learning, Duolingo is the place to go. If you have an account online, add it to you Kindle Fire, and connect with Facebook friends as well!<br /><br />Utterly Impressed,<br /><br />Thanks Duolingo!

031623480X|5.0|This book follows in the lines of wheat belly, serve to win, etc.  If you have read a lot in this area, there is still some good information, but nothing earth shattering that hasn't been mentioned before.  However, for someone just starting to look for information, this is a great resource
B007EECSFA|5.0|Ever deeper into its secrets until I couldn't put it down. Morton is a master weaver, imitating the stranger circumstances of life in a way that continued to build then, amaze the reader. I felt I was on the search for answers in my own family history I was so involved page after page. She has a way of writing fate and picking apart it's intricacies. A very satisfying read for anyone interested in history, tracing familial roots, and secrets.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I love this album. It is deep and sometimes dark but at the same time happy and upbeat. Those Icelanders sure love their heys!<br /><br />I love this album because it has amazing strong writing, great lyrics and harmonies, and because it is unique enough to feel personal but general enough for it to be an easy listening album. I can listen and work and my kids love to listen to it in the car. My daughter is 4 and loves this album.<br /><br />Songs that are my favorite include: Dirty Paws, Lionheart, Lake House and Yellow Light.<br /><br />I also recommend watching their videos for Little Talks and Lionheart. Amazing Imagery.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Although it does not have all the bells and whistles of some of the other streaming adaptors, it is in expensive and simple to use.  I bought a second one so my grandson can stream to the TV in his room.  Hopefully Google will open it up to more applications.

B000FCKC4C|5.0|I loved this book and how it ties fulfilling one's purpose with the wisdom found throughout the Bible. I will read this book to my children in their tween but I'm sure these words again will be the encouragement I need to continue on the pursuit of my own Personal Legend.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I love this book it is absolutely amazing I can't wait till I get the next one. I love it so much
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow. This book was awful. Was she paid each time she wrote 'blush' or 'flush'? Never so sick of reading the same words over & over again. It actually became distracting. Who edited this book?<br /><br />The story line was straight out of a B movie and so unbelievable that it was hard to keep reading.<br /><br />I received it as a gift, so I'm not out any money, but do yourself a favor -don't buy it new. Go to a garage sale or thrift shop & look for it. If you find it for less than $1 try to talk them down & then buy it.<br /><br />If I had it in book form & not the Kindle edition, I'd just throw it in the garbage. That's really the only place it truly belongs. Wish I had the ability to give it 0 stars as 1 is 1 too many.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn never disappoints. This is a page turner from beginning to end. I liked it as much as Gone Girl and will definitely read Sharp Objects

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Using this on Kindle Fire 7 and 8.9 HD<br /><br />This is a wonderful tool to have for your current local weather and for ANY other location in the world you are curious about. You can put in three different locations that will pop up immediately; and, you can see what the rest of your week has in store for you. You can check out what's happening from Buenos Aires to South Africa to China with a quick swipe. There are many amazing videos from the latest tropical storm to crazy weather in space.<br /><br />To that end, the greatest feature (besides the fact this app is free) is that you can earn what are called &quot;mPoints&quot;. You can then, in turn, redeem these points for gift cards (I have redeemed $5 in Amazon gift cards), apply the points towards prizes ,  enter a drawing for gift cards (for instance $100 Amazon gift card) or you can donate the monetary value of the points to a specific charity. So, no matter what, this app is a win-win combination...you can help yourself and others-pretty awesome!<br /><br />I don't usually leave reviews; BUT, this one has rewarded me 100x over and I felt like I should return the favor.<br /><br />The download was super quick, I have encountered no glitches and Lookout (my antivirus protection) says this app is completely safe!<br /><br />Hopefully, this helps someone who relies on reviews (as I do ALL the time)!

B008JFUO72|1.0|I've notices that many movies say &#34;Digital Download&#34;. Most will mean that it's Ultra Violet - which can be watched on Flixter and Vudu. Just last week, I purchased World War Z on Amazon. It said Digital Download, but included Ultra Violet<br /><br />This movie is a PC based digital download - no streaming<br /><br />Also - Walmart is selling the same DVD/DD version for $15.99 (Amazon was $18.99, reduced to $17.99<br /><br />The movie is great. I'm sure the DVD works - but they need to describe in the details what we're getting
B00AEBBAEU|4.0|Finally, a film about everything kids love: corporate corruption and greed, betrayal, mineral rights, milkshakes, and religion. This film really has everything you would possibly want in a film.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day-Lewis) and Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) are absolutely made for each other. Plainview, a self described \\"oil man\\" who slowly evolves into a wealthy, shameless, greedy, psychopathic business man is constantly at odds with the manipulative preacher, Eli, and in their own way they turn this film about antiquated oil drilling into a film that is instead about two villains fighting each other. By the end of the film, the only one you will sympathize with is Plainview's son, who is stricken deaf after an accident and slowly comes to recognize and hate his father's selfishness.<br /><br />The greatest thing about this film is it's atmosphere and sense of period. The sets feel authentic, and even though this is a movie about greed and business the film maintains an almost surreal atmosphere that is thick with eeriness and suspense.<br /><br />If there's anything wrong with it, I'd say that it is a bit overrated. Many people have gone about calling this the \\"greatest film of all time\\", and while I agree that it's good I'm just not convinced that it's that great.<br /><br />That being said, I still recommend this. The build up and pace are great, the acting is near perfect, and the ending, well- let's just say you should definitely trust the title. There most certainly will be blood.
B00DGGIXS6|5.0|closer to the Truth is no doubtly cher's best. The fast dance songs are great..My love, Take it like a Man, Dressed to Kill are some that stand out. It gets better with the ballads. Sirens is an awesome song, very U2. I Hope You Find It, I Walk Alone, Lie to Me are just terrific and Cher's voice never sounded better. Well worth my money.
1781162646|5.0|Once again, Constant Reader, you will find yourself easily slipping into another comfortable Stephen King book. 'Joyland' is pure fun suspense and endearing. So much so, that I am not too ashamed to admit that I shed a tear at the end. It's King having a fun-time at the amusement park with a serial killer running amuck! Can't go wrong.

B005OT2YVA|1.0|Just dreadful.<br /><br />I really shouldn't need more words, because that sums it up, but Mr. Bay has actually sunk below the level of his previous Transformers movies.  He started with promising materials, because transforming robots, and then draggd it all through a mud-puddle of not-caring-if-it-makes-sense.<br /><br />Dreadful.  Not even worth watching to make fun of.<br /><br />Dreadful.

B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Works great with my Windows 7 x64 desktop. I had no issues with it recognizes the hub or any of the attached hard drives. It's great having more USB 3.0 ports to connect additional drives as my computer only has 2 USB 3.0 ports. Great file transfer speeds even when transferring across drives connected to the same hub (and thus sharing a USB port on the host machine).<br /><br />Only complaint is the attached cable is a little short depending on where you want to set this up but I knew that going in.
0767802519|4.0|Luc Besson knows how to make a glossy and engaging action thriller.  He did it in 1990 with `La Femme Nikita' and he did it again with `Leon: The Professional', his American film directorial debut.  While elements of this film don't work entirely (parts feel redundant or uninspired, and Oldman is way too over-the-top), there is no denying that the film as a whole is intriguing and completely entertaining.  The handling of the storyline, and the beautiful relationship development that spawns between Leon and Mathilda help elevate the film from a mere action flick and give it life.<br /><br />The story that develops here follows a hired hitman named Leon who takes a young newly orphaned girl under his wing when her family is murdered by a dirty cop (really dirty).  This young girl, 12 year-old Mathilda, isn't content with moving on from the tragedy of her life in the arms of this rugged hitman; she wants revenge, and revenge she will get.<br /><br />Natalie Portman, who has definitely made the most of her career as of recently, is astonishingly good here.  She pulls out such savage emotions at such a young age and really establishes her talent, regardless of how I personally feel her career `stumbled' in her early adulthood.  Jean Reno tends to play the same character in every film (or at least a variation of that character) and he does that here too, but with a quiet sincerity that draws you to him.  Gary Oldman is the only sore spot for me, manic and just `too much', but he doesn't distract too much from the film itself.<br /><br />With intense direction and editing that spills over into every frame, `Leon: The Professional' hits a lot of the right marks and earns the nice reputation it has as a cult classic of the genre.  You can't really go wrong with Besson, can you?<br /><br />Don't answer that.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|I enjoyed all three books, was very surprised how the third book ended! Kept me talking about the books for days!
B004SIP6ZE|4.0|For a film of this nature, `The Crow' works rather well.  It is atmospheric and tense and has all the action and visual effects that drive teenage boys (and many middle aged men) crazy.  The backstory surrounding the accidental death of Brandon Lee is truly unfortunate and has somewhat taken over the film itself.  In fact, I'm not sure that this film would be remembered by so many people had the real-life events not remained on the forefront of everyone's mind.  The prolific script adds an eerie overtone to the film, but one cannot deny the film its visual appeal.  This supernatural action thriller survives for reasons unrelated to the action `film' and yet it stands tall on its own technical achievements, complete with stunning visual effects and a score that drips with electric style and atmosphere.
1476734941|5.0|The book just has one simple message: fast two days a week and you'll lose weight.  It's definitely not necessary to purchase the book and I would recommend that you borrow it from your local library.  I tried to do that but there were 35 holds on it and didn't want to wait that long!  I have several \\"diet\\" books on my shelf and am a believer in limiting sugar and gluten.  I'm very interested in nutrition and human physiology.  Anyway, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  He lost about seven pounds in just the first week.  I lost 6.5 pounds in four weeks, which is amazing.  I'm only 5'2\\" and my starting weight was 131.  I hardly exercised...maybe about 20 minutes on the treadmill one day each week.  I also ate like a pig on the weekends.  I have reduced my calories to 300 on my fasting days because I'm starting closer to my ideal weight for my height.  It's nice to see results every week without having to kill myself running and counting calories.
B00DJZR46G|2.0|I remember when I would wait in the record store back in the 70s, while the clerk unpacked the newest Elton album, get home and memorize it.  My bands had to cover Elton if they wanted me to learn the synth runs from Yes, ELP, and prog rock.  40 years on, Elton has become the gay Paul McCartney.<br /><br />It's not that the songs are bad, they're just not memorable.  No great hooks, no \\"instant classic\\".  The piano interludes?  More like Hanon exercises.  Extended intros that lead nowhere until he starts singing, and then his aged voice, deeper and more emotional, is completely undermined by his decade-old lisp that showed up after Diana died.<br /><br />If history is any indication, Elton's next album will be a classical composition that he performs with the London Philharmonic.  And then he can retire to Vegas, where his show rocks with classic Elton.<br /><br />Skip this album, save your money, go see him in Vegas.<br /><br />The Queen is dead. Long live the Queen.

Suddenly, there is found, a meteorite with life forms embedded in it, found by a NASA satellite system.  Can this be true?  It is verified by many non-NASA/government people, and seems so.  But, suddenly bad things start happening.  Dan has kept the secret up til the last, and I am good at guessing whodunit, but not this time.  This is a real cliff hanger.

I have just finished the book, and it took some time to read ALL the books, but it was well worth the time.  There is some biographical info at the first, and an extensive glossary at the end.  I really enjoyed reading Watson's \\"notes\\" on Sherlock's cases.

On the very first experiment I found something that I thought I had lost for good and had been looking everywhere for it for over 6 months! I don't want to give away the book or create a preconceived idea for anyone but, for me, there could not have been any better proof of concept than the end result which was finding what I had thought I lost!!<br />Can't wait to complete all nine experiments!

B00DJ80VLS|5.0|Better of the 2 post-Portnoy releases.  I have been listening to this record for the last 5 days.  I haven't done that with a Dream Theater release since Train of Thought.  This album really impressed me musically.  The writing is great and fresh.  There are a lot of Rush influenced riffs on this record and that's a very good thing.  Dream Theater has always honored their influences tastefully.<br /><br />Having Mangini along for the writing process really helped.  There are great moments of rhythmic fun between Petrucci (arguably the best metal rhythm player ever) and Mangini that weren't on the last album.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the album was with the snare drum.  It sounded too processed and there are some bad gating issues with the snare (song 5 intro for instance).  The crash cymbals were a little less defined that what I like but the hi hats were toned down quite a bit from the last album.  The toms were great and overall I was pleased with the volume of the tom fills.
B0059DQHHI|4.0|Not sure what to make of this movie, didn't hate it but didn't love it either, just liked it. Pretty much predictable once the wedding scene began. Not sure why some complained about sub-titles, you are watching a foreign film, expect it, that doesn't have anything to do with the movie itself. Some of the long winded reviews are spoilers, no need to even watch the movie at all if you read them. Oh well, maybe I need to watch it again, perhaps I will love it the 2nd time around instead of just like it.

0307271609|4.0|While we visited China we saw the famous Summer Palace in Beijing where we first heard stories about the Empress Dowager Cixi - who was first noticed as a concubine but grew in influence to the point where she served as de facto ruler of China.  This would be remarkable enough, but it turns out that Empress Dowager Cixi was quite the regent.<br /><br />Alternatively viewed by some historians as despot, villain, reformer and progressive ruler, there seems no doubt that Cixi wielded as much power in China as her contemporary Queen Victoria.<br /><br />Jung Chang's research is molded into a compelling historical narrative.  Absolutely recommended for any students of history.

B0082XJGRK|3.0|I don't know who did the translation for this one but I found it very difficult to follow. This prompted me to look around and I found another translation by George Long (Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus 1862). Even though it's not a recent translation, Long's version is often easier to understand. Compare the translations of the first paragraph for example:<br /><br />This version:<br /><br />Of my grandfather Verus I have learned to be gentle and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. From the fame and memory of him that begot me I have learned both shamefastness and manlike behaviour. Of my mother I have learned to be religious, and bountiful; and to forbear, not only to do, but to intend any evil; to content myself with a spare diet, and to fly all such excess as is incidental to great wealth. Of my great-grandfather, both to frequent public schools and auditories, and to get me good and able teachers at home; and that I ought not to think much, if upon such occasions, I were at excessive charges.<br /><br />George Long's version:<br /><br />From my grandfather Verus I learned good morals and the government of my temper. From the reputation and remembrance of my father, modesty and a manly character. From my mother, piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only from evil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my way of living, far removed from the habits of the rich. From my great-grandfather, not to have frequented public schools, and to have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a man should spend liberally.<br /><br />Having said this however, it's still worth comparing both translations which are free on the Kindle.

1451627297|3.0|[*spoiler alert!*] If you haven't read the book, please don't read further.  This is a *review* which means it comes *after* reading the book...;)<br /><br />I've enjoyed reading King's books since the late '70's when I read Night Shift on the beach during a vacation.  He remains one of my favorite writers even though his recent works almost seem like a somewhat dull apology to the literary world for his previous efforts, and I find that really too bad.  I like King at his best when he's outrageous and unpredictable and when he comes up with a premise that probably would never have occurred to me.  His recent works, whether short stories or novels, seem to somehow reflect a certain emptiness in his life--the main characters are more often than not loners with very nearly anti-social tendencies and very loose connections with family.  This kind of characterization has become almost a staple of King's latest works. Writing in the first person used to be frowned upon, and in a book like 11/22/63 I can see why.<br /><br />Come on, Steve.  The premise of the book is so hackneyed it is beyond belief. It's even a pet political theory of liberal people of the Democratic-party stripe everywhere--\\"Gee, just think of what would be if we could travel back in time and save JFK!\\"  But, this touches on the one thing I did *like* very much about the book--he reminds us all of how easily things might've ended up much, much worse had Kennedy lived through the assassination attempt and gone on to win reelection.  I applaud that part of the book!  In reading this wordy, utterly verbose novel-within-a-novel, I kept saying to myself all the way through: \\"If he creates a utopian future and lays the blame for that on the fact that Kennedy didn't die in '63, I will absolutely throw up all over this book!\\"  So, I was delighted in that he didn't let me down in that regard--nobody knows what might have happened differently had Kennedy lived, of course. It might even have been that absolutely nothing would have changed, aside from the Presidential roll call.<br /><br />Rather than the end being festooned with string theories about time run amok, I have always imagined that with his penchant of not backing down, Kennedy might have conceivably started a nuclear war--that was my own idea of how Kennedy might have messed things up, given the chance.  But that's a trivial distinction, really, given the nightmare created by the attempt to save JFK in the book. At the time in which 11/22/63 is based, politics then were pretty much 180-degrees out from the politics of today.  The Democrats were business champions in those days, and champions of tax cuts, etc., and I have little doubt that if Kennedy was alive today, his political principles intact, he'd be a Republican...;)<br /><br />Come on, though--George Wallace succeeding JFK as president?  Not in a million years.  The fact is that in most of our wars the Democratic party has forged the lead--not the Republican party, as is so often mistakenly said. Lincoln was a Republican, and the Jim Crow society was formed by Democratic-party politicians, not Republicans.  So the Wallace presidency (even though in real history Wallace ran as an Independent and lost) was never in the cards, JFk or no JFK.  Everybody who was anybody really liked JFK because of his youth and vigor, mainly.  He was, in a word, \\"Presidential,\\" very much like Ronald Reagan, also a very popular president.  The bright and smiling and energetic Kennedy stood in sharp contrast to the secretive and dark Nixon who reeked of paranoia.  And I'm speaking about the south where, unlike King, I grew up.<br /><br />And I can remember seeing \\"Colored Only\\" on some store entrances and bathroom instances, and in North Carolina, too, as late as when I was a teenager and driving...But I just cringed at King highlighting this in his book, in the south, because in the north it wasn't a whole lot better for black people--only most of the south was simply much morehonest and open about it than you found in the north, where they spoke a good game but rarely played one, as many black immigrants from the south discovered to their utter disdain.  My point is simply that those things are no longer true and haven't been true for decades. So why harp on it again?  I was surprised to see that King didn't also pull slavery out of the closet and dust off that old saw, even though there is no one living in the US who either was a slave or owned a slave.  Ancient history, practically.  As I recall, several southern states helped put Obama over the top in not just one but two elections--which kind of says to me that \\"Colored only\\" is as dead as it will ever be in the south. Whipping a dead horse, is the expression that comes to mind.  There's an entire generation or two of blacks in the US who cannot remember those days--and I think that's something for the nation to be proud of.<br /><br />King's quip about the bar in Dallas that said \\"No guns allowed inside\\" or something like that was nearly indecipherable.  How many people are killed each year in northern and western bars by pistols, rifles, shotguns, and knives?  Too many.  That's a mandate that ought to be legally applicable to all bars, whether in Dallas or in Maine.  So, what was \\"hateful\\" about that?  King lost me on that one.  Is he even aware of the real fact that registered gun owners are involved in about 3% of all murders committed with handguns in the US today?  Probably not--probably doesn't care to know.  I'd hate to think he was one of those who thinks that if he doesn't see such text over the door of a bar in Maine it means that people in Main never shoot each other in bars, or get into drunken brawls, or otherwise maim and murder each other. It just ain't so, daddy-o. He talks of Dallas being \\"hateful\\" in '63 because of some flags flown that merely reflect the true history of the country--and a sign over a bar.  Yet, it seemed to me that his main character in the bookgot out of Dallas exactly what he put into it.  Nothing.  Wonder what \\"hateful\\" signage we might discover in Maine if we bothered to look for it?  Who knows?  And who cares?  Beating a dead horse, indeed.  Sorry, Steve, but carrying a licensed firearm does not automatically mean that you \\"hate\\" people.  You are usually not so sloppy with cliche's.<br /><br />OK, the real bugaboo about which I feel king erred egregiously was Vietnam. He tried, mightily, to absolve JFK of all responsibility for what Johnson did in escalating the war, without ever having the moxie to point out that if not for JFK the US would never have had *anybody* in Vietnam to begin with.  Without prior US involvement in the life of that country, it is near impossible to believe Johnson as president would ever have sought out such a thing himself.  It is often said, and I think truthfully, that Johnson believed he was doing little more than carrying out JFK's policies.  The truth is they were both to blame for Vietnam, and they were both Democrats (yet again.) So what, if JFK told a reporter he'd never escalate the war?  How many things did Obama pledge in his campaign that he flat did not do once he was elected?  This is a thing that all presidents seem to do--come down with a bad case of political-promise amnesia.  Again, no one knows *what* JFK would have done in Vietnam. Period, end of story. But the fact that JFK put us there in the first place is indisputable. And I liked JFK but wasn't quite old enough to be a supporter at the ballot box.<br /><br />Like is true for most movie stars and actors, King's political opinions are often based on hearsay and gossip and are, as a result, more often than not, \\"crapola.\\" I don't care what actors and actresses think politically, and on those rare occasions when they've spouted off in that direction, I have found their opinions to be so poorly constructed that they were idiotic.  I want to watch them act--not pontificate politically.  That is a real turn-off.  Same with popular fiction writers like King.  He's in top form when he's not debasing himself with poorly constructed political leanings and cliches.  I like his fiction a lot--but I hold my nose in reaction to his politics as he seems to reveal them in 11/22/63.<br /><br />Just about done here...the love story in the novel was interesting in its own right--which is why I call this novel a novel-within-a-novel.  In fact, I became so engrossed in it that at times I forgot about the overarching plot...!  Not good...I really enjoyed the sections dealing with the psycho from Savannah, GA, and in fact consider that section the highpoint of suspense in the entire book--easily could have been an entirely separate novel.  But honestly, I found it completely off the plot of 11/22/63. (King's attempts to weave it into the plot were insufficient, I thought, and unconvincing.)<br /><br />This book was certainly not terrible, and at times it glowed.  But those times were too few and too far in between.  That's why I gave it three stars--a \\"C\\" in my book.  Firstly, because the premise was the antithesis of original, and secondly because it managed to politically pontificate, if not lecture, and I felt that was unnecessary and mostly uninformative.  In short, I think King could have done a far better job with the premise than he managed.

B0084670FU|1.0|The whole thing just left me depressed at the end. The concept was great...How our lives somehow inter connect with other peoples lives around the world. Maybe Im just a sucker for a movie that has more of a happy ending. This just DID NOT.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this is a fun game to play with excellent graphics I highly reccomend this game if you like hidden object games with an action spooky storyline
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This completes our set of HP movies.  The price was good, although your policy of uniform postage and handling simply adds to the seller's profit -- the actual cost of mailing was far less than that charged.  We were surprised to see the large estimate of time to receive the disc, but happy that it came sooner than estimated.

B008602KQI|4.0|Read the series so I thought I'd try the movie....not too bad. At least it kept me interested. Minimal violence considering.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|I read the book some time ago and then saw this in theaters.  I was re-watching it bored one night.  Is it worth a watch?  I'd say yes, but only if you know what you're getting into.  If you're just looking for an entertaining movie to watch and know little about the story, it might be a bit long (perceived as boring).  If you've read The Great Gatsby you should watch.  Purists are probably upset as this is an art-deco retooling of the movie.  As such everything is over-the-top.<br /><br />The good:<br />- It follows the book pretty closely without much alteration.<br />- The imagery is beautiful.<br />- The lighting in the movie is fantastic.<br />- It's The Great Gatsby!<br /><br />The bad:<br />- Leo might have added a touch too much to Jay.  The character is already over the top, but Leo makes him a bit tooooo crazy in my opinion.<br />- The Great Gatsby should be about emotion.  The overacting from nearly everyone in the movie pushed it beyond a simple emotional story, into a jazzy show-tune.  That's where the disconnect occurs and everyone thinks it's boring, because it's not believable.  You can't feel the emotion of Daisy and Jay.<br />- They gloss over some of the past history from the book.  Those scenes feel about 5 seconds long...but they're important to the character development.<br /><br />The ugly:<br />- Jay-Z?  Seriously?  The music choices in this movie are awful.<br />- The ending feels rushed while the middle of the movie falls flat.  Hard to connect to over acted characters.<br />- Wolfsheim...another poor casting job.  I went in expecting Arnold Rothstein and came out feeling like he was dirty poor pimp rather than the man that fixed the world series.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Worth the watch, but don't expect the greatest movie you've ever seen.  Some might like it, others will hate it.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I've been using this app on my 7&#34; Kindle Fire HD and my HTC One SV for approximately a week... maybe a week and a half now, and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />I'm using it to learn German... not sure what other language options there are, although I know Spanish and French are in there. So far I am hugely impressed. The app uses a combination of written, spoken, and visual cues/questions... so one question may ask me to translate a sentence from German to English, the next question might be to translate something from English to German, and the question after that may be to speak a sentence in German or to write a sentence in German that the app speaks (the app's voice is not great, but definitely serviceable)... reinforced occasionally by visual cues such as labeled pictures (i.e. a picture of a dude labeled &#34;der Mann&#34;... you get the idea after a bit).<br /><br />The teaching method works, I have to say... and this from a guy who always considered himself critically handicapped when it came to learning new languages.  Granted, I'm early into the program, but I am retaining a large part of each lesson, which is honestly more than I can say for my experience with Rosetta Stone.<br /><br />There are two cons that I've noted: First, and this may have been an individual problem, the app wouldn't let me sign in with either Google+ or Facebook... it has buttons for doing that, but they didn't work... so I had to go old-school and actually create a separate account.  Minor glitch, but still worth noting.  The second con is that in the course of the lessons, I haven't yet encountered a definitive explanation of certain rules of grammar, i.e. when to use one form or another of a verb. On one hand this is vaguely annoying, as I end up with wrong answers without being entirely certain why they're wrong; on the other hand, however, I suspect that this is actually increasing the effectiveness of the program, as this makes me really think about each word before I use it, and when I'm wrong, I really study WHY I was wrong, which ultimately increases retention of the language. So kudos for effectiveness, even if it is a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall... freaking awesome.  Get this app.  I can't believe it's free, honestly, but as long as it is, get it!e it, and when I'm wrong, I really study WHY I was wrong, which ultimately increases retention of the language. So kudos for effectiveness, even if it is a bit annoying.<br /><br />Overall... freaking awesome.  Get this app.  I can't believe it's free, honestly, but as long as it is, get it!

1597801585|5.0|One of the best books that I have read in a very long time.  Post apocalyptic but not over done.  It doesn't have characters that are so  wonderful that they are unreal but neither does it have characters that are so flawed that it just seemed the author wanted to make a failed point.  That is a very fine line.  I got emotionally involved in some way with all of the characters; at different points I would like a character and then a few pages later I was secretly wishing them to fail and would just keep riding that line the whole way through.  Some people die, some live and I really don't think that I was really rooting for anyone in particular.  It was just so utterly realistic that it was beautiful.

B00C7NKPPS|5.0|I purchased the 3 CD version of this CD from Best Buy, which is the same as the 3 CD available on Amazon.<br /><br />This is a similar purchase to compare with updating the old 1987 Beatles CD releases with the 2009 remastered versions.  The sound quality is just much better.<br />Remastered at Abbey Road studio.<br /><br />I recommend the 3 CD version, which adds a bonus disc with 8 songs from another performance live at the Cow Palace in San Francisco from the same tour.  There<br />are no songs different from what is available on the original disc but it just has a better acoustic ambiance which has more musical presence.  That 3rd disc<br />is a great one to put in with a bottle of bubbly and a nice dinner with the little lady, as it ends with an acoustic song cycle great for romance.<br />Unfortunately the song \\"Picasso's Last Words\\" just fades out suddenly and ends at 2:14 minutes.  Awkward and why so?  With just 8 songs, why not include<br />another song all the way through?  I don't have any setlist information but it's just odd and disappointing to do that.  The only gripe so far.<br /><br />There is nothing too much to the booklet; a few new photos not included in the original CD release from the 1980s nor the original LP but nothing in the way<br />of liner notes nor an essay.  The original CD release simply had the main gatefold photo separated, blown up, and split into parts and had no information not<br />included in the new release.<br /><br />But the remastered sound quality is quite good and the song list is just incredible and a great way to experience the various sounds that Paul was capable of<br />at the time.<br /><br />Casual fans will do fine with the 2 CD standard issue remaster; more serious fans will want/need the 3 CD version which at this time doesn't cost much more.<br />They will want to chuck their old version after purchasing this or the standard 2 CD version.<br /><br />One could gripe the 3rd disc would have been better with at least one song not on the main release but that's the way it goes.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B008JFUQ3O|5.0|Not by Disney.  Not by Pixar.  Universal released this gem!<br /><br />Not the first, but the first sequel of the smashingly enjoyable Despicable Me.  Some reviewers panned this on RT, but they must have been looking for something with Shakespeare or lots of guns, fights and chase scenes.  A 76% Fresh didn't deter me and I had the time of my life with a big bucket of popcorn and soda.<br /><br />The Minions are as daft and silly, yet supportive as ever, but they aren't the only thing to like - the girls are still complete peaches and Agnes will still charm your socks off.  The League gives Gru a fresh spark and Eduardo provides a worthy challenge as Minions mysteriously disappear.  Pierre Coffin's influence continues to be a fresh breath into cinema as there's plenty of fun and mystery, spun far away from the tired retreads of Hollywood.  Looking forward to more.  Can't wait for the DVD to arrive so I can watch it again and again.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had heard alot about Doctor Who in the past and after some googling It was suggested you start right here. The series had been on for 30+ years but this was a reemergence of it, a modernization so to say.<br />At 1st you might be taken back by cheap effects and costumes that could of been obviously better but that improves as it goes on and falls to the way side.<br />The premise and the characters will capture you. The storys are great and because of the dynamic of the show they can be about literally anything, witches in the 1700 to a race war on Venus in the future.<br /><br />Its easy for me to see why people are hooked on this show but im sure for some it might be an acquired taste. This is the perfect place to start

0767810856|4.0|Nicolas Cage plays such an endearing role as a police officer.  On the other hand, he has a greedy, screeching wife.  One day Cage doesn't have money to leave a tip for a waitress at a cafe.  He takes out a lottery ticket and promises her half of his winnings if he wins OR he will return with the tip.  She chooses the lottery nothing dreaming that he would come back with either.  He wins the lottery for millions of dollars and, as promised, comes back and promises her half.  His wife finds out and does everything she can to stop it...or at least make his life miserable until he does.  The wife is trying to spend the money faster than it is handed out.  It is really a heart-warming, charming movie!  I recommend it.

B0007LXPBI|4.0|This is an adorable movie with Lindsay Lohan.  She gives an outstanding performance as a set of twins who were separated when their parents got divorced.  The mother (Natasha Richardson) moved back to her native England, and the father (Dennis Quaid) stayed at his vineyard in California.  The twins are unknowingly sent to the same summer camp by their parents when they are young teenagers.  They meet and discover their real identities.  Then they are set on getting their parents back together again.  This makes for some amusing situations, one of which is that each girl takes the other's place when camp is over.  A delightful movie.

B00003CXSP|4.0|First off, I'd like to address the elephant in the room (if you have not read the novel that this film was based on, you're currently being squeezed against a wall by that elephant and in the room.  You probably don't know why, so guess what you ought to do.)  Thank you for writing a different ending for the film version of this story because I, like many readers, could never wrap my head around the ending that author Thomas Harris had created in the novel [[ASIN:0440224675 Hannibal]].       Unlike [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], this film wasn't as suspenseful and is sliding back into the mold of a standard action thriller...it would have probably kept sliding beyond that if the ending hadn't been changed.  Having Anthony Hopkins back as Dr. Hannibal Lector certainly kept the film out of the standard action thriller genre.  I'm just not sure if Dr. Lector is ever a character we should root for while he's on the run and getting away with all kinds of evil things.  I liked him better when he was the evil, psychopathic doctor we loathed but simultaneously couldn't stop watching.  Perhaps we should have had Jack Crawford in the film (he was in the book) as his hatred for the doctor could have brought us those awesome characteristics we've come to know and love.       Perhaps we should have also had Jody Foster back in this picture, though Julianne Moore was a decent Clarice Starling...she just couldn't stand up to the plot and I think Foster would have had the same problem to some extent...they're both much too good for something in danger of becoming a standard action thriller.       I will say that Gary Oldman did play a nicely creepy villain who embodied all the characteristics I mentioned earlier about Dr. Lector.  Unfortunately that does not make up for Dr. Lector's change in character...they should have both been like that.  Ray Liotta often just came off as a bumbling henchman instead of a competent, conniving federal agent.  If I wanted anyone off my screen, it was him...which is a shame as I do like Ray Liotta as an actor.  It just wasn't his day.       But despite all my disagreements and rants against this film, it's still decent and worth adding to your Hannibal Lector collection...and like I said, it's got a better ending than the book.  Maybe Jonathan Demme ought to come back and direct a sequel to this film...who knows what it might be like.  Enjoy.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Much like when Batman went into the Dark Knight series and revitalized the original theme, this Dredd does the same. The first movie with Stallone was a joke, almost entirely a comedy. This version is what Dredd was always meant to be. Dark.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|This is no big-budget blockbuster but it's no lowly-funded indy film either.  Its high school drama exaggerated just enough to make it funny with a terrific cast who make it work.       Emma Stone shines as a girl who evidently defines all the stereotypes of her high school by being smart (personally, no problem with the \\"smart\\" thing.)  Her brash manner, sarcastic dialogue, and timely delivery make me wonder how much of all that was actually scripted.  Perhaps this is a \\"period piece\\" of the 21st century, holding up a mirror to America's high schools and the expectations and beliefs that drive so many teenagers' actions.         My main (and quite possibly only legit) complaint has to do with Thomas Haden Church and Malcolm McDowell.  Both men are great actors and were sinfully underused in this film...granted, I don't know how their roles could have been expanded, but I don't work in Hollywood.  All I know for sure is that their performances were just as enjoyable as Ms. Stone's and I wish I could have seen more of them.  At least the producers didn't go the easy route and cast unknowns we couldn't enjoy in these roles.  As little screen-time as they got, every second was worth it...so why couldn't they have gotten more?       But if you are willing to live with such an injustice as I seem to manage to, add this film to your collection.  It's always good for a laugh...and you can watch Emma Stone doing her own version of karaoke.  Enjoy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|While it may seem a challenge to keep all the characters straight, the interconnections are so satisfying. The end made me cry just as the beginning made my heart break for these people of Afghanistan. All the pain and suffering we associate with Afghanistan there is a positive thanks to Khaled Hosseini's ability to paint a vivid picture of a complex country past and present.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I'm sure that my subject line has been thrown around in Hollywood before, but this is a film which truely deserves such praise.<br />  While Emma Stone has seemingly proven that she can do no wrong (for me at least), it was Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer who shined in this film as it exposed both positives and negatives about the lives of \\"the help\\" in Mississippi during the Civil Rights movement.  Granted, there were more negatives, but that was to be expected.  This film is just a few steps from being considered a documentary.  While the plot may be depressing at times, it brings it's appropriate share of laughs and Miss Octavia Spencer is largely to thank for that.<br />  I was also pleased to see Allison Janney in this picture as I've been a fan of hers since \\"The West Wing\\".  Like Ms. Stone, Miss Janney did not dissappoint as she plays a mother who's clearly dealing with the moral conflict of not being outright racist in Mississippi in the 1960s while dealing with her struggles against cancer.  Side note:  could I get the name of the acting coach who taught everyone their southern accents...that just made it all better.<br />  Anyway, Viola Davis as a maternal figure who finds her oppurtunity to change what she sees as a never-ending cycle of oppression is terrific.  Miss Davis's more intraverted manners balance nicely with the outgoing nature brought by Octavia Spencer.  While Emma Stone's character traits aren't really unique or memorable except for her wanting to be judged for her mind instead of her body (i.e. she didn't major in \\"husband hunting\\" during her university years), it was these non-original, stock-character traits that fit her perfectly into the story, allowing the three leading ladies to develop the right amount of chemistry for this film.<br />  The movie stays pretty loyal to it's source material and any changes or omissions made are all right with me...maybe I like Skeeter's mother better in the film...she seemed a bit more complex than shewas in the book.  It is a must-have if you want any picture that's interesting with a solid story that you just want to see through to the end.  Enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging little game. Enjoyed trying to &quot;escape&quot; from the different rooms. Nice that you didn't make it too easy. Although I will admit that I had to come back to a couple of the rooms after giving them some thought. Ready for more please!!
B00005JLKN|5.0|Normally, I'm skeptical about remakes because they're rarely as good as the original...I'm sure I'm not alone in regards to that sentiment.  However, Red Dragon, a remake of [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]], is that rare film that serves as the exception to the rule...and that works out just fine for me.  I have no trouble saying I like this film better, though it's only partially due to the fact that it sticks more closely to its source material.       Anthony Hopkins may have aged since 1991's [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] but he's able to be just as scary and crazy as ever.  Perhaps this is the film that can really serve to decide who plays the better doctor...Hopkins or Brian Cox.  Anyway, Edward Norton stepped nicely into William Peterson's shoes as Agent Will Graham while Ralph Fiennes was perfect as the quiet yet savage murderer Francis Dolarhyde.  My biggest problem, if minor in the scheme of things, is the killer's nickname, \\"The Tooth Fairy\\".  No matter what book or movie adaptation it was used in, I never really came around to it...it just didn't sound rightly villainous to me.  But it's a minor issue that I'm just obsessed over...don't let it stop you from watching this film.       It was also nice to see Anthony Heald and Frankie Faison return as Dr. Frederick Chilton and Barney respectively (note that Frankie Faison played a cop in the original [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]]).  Harvey Keitel played a good Jack Crawford, but I'm probably biased since I am a big fan of Dennis Ferena in general (and no one can top the performance of Scott Glen from [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]]).          As I've said, I like this film better than [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]].  Yes, it sticks more closely to its source material, the novel [[ASIN:0425228223 Red Dragon]], but it does other things better as well.  It tells a better story.  [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]] often felt like a generic thriller film.  It was good, but just not done as well as it could have been, source material or not.  Red Dragon is the film adaptation that fully realizes the plot, the characters, the twists, and, of course, the conflicts, both internal and external.  [[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]] did this to an extent, but again, it could have gone further.  Both films are good and worth watching, but Red Dragon is just better.       In the end, this remake did have a few playful gimmicks that are apparently unavoidable whenever you do a remake (i.e. Dr. Lector's \\"exercise cage\\"...was that really necessary?)  And I do wonder if they absolutely had to have that last bit of dialog at the end of the film that would usher in its \\"sequel\\", [[ASIN:B000LP6KNU The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].  But despite these minor disagreements, I say this is a fine film and worth adding to your Hannibal Lector collection.

0061452068|4.0|This book is worth reading for the unique case it makes for optimism about the future of the world.  My main complaint about it would be that the author is kind of a zealot for the cause of so-called &#34;free markets&#34; and about the middle-third of the book contains a long, vague explanation of their role in the history of civilization.  Still a good book though!  Read it and then give it to the biggest pessimist you know.

B0012GTZC0|5.0|For those just getting around to this novel keep in mind that it was published in 1978. So the story and plot devices may not seem fresh because you will have probably read similar works. But those similar works are a result of Follett providing the template. So it is for that reason that the book gets five stars. The brilliant sleeper agent, earnest pursuers and an unanticipated wrench in the plan now seem familiar but was freshly executed by the author.<br /><br />The pace is fantastic as is the wide cast of characters including real historic figures. The book is all about deception from a German agent to a fake army to a ruinous marriage, deceit abounds. It was also a bit racy with a graphic coupling I had largely forgotten from my first pass years ago. This is a great beach or fireside read. Enjoy!<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br />In the film The Iron Lady is a scene in which the retired Margaret Thatcher is shown reading Eye of the Needle while her husband Denis Thatcher remarks &quot;In the end she kills him, you know.&quot;
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Another star lost for excessive details. I feel like at some point I should really cut Martin a break, but then again I think about how I put over forty hours into finishing this book and I completely change my mind. Story telling shouldn't move at a snail's pace more than half the time. So here is the breakdown of events in this book. People get killed again for unfounded reasons, and others most likely at the end of the book will seem to be killed, but events in the next book will explain how that at the last second they were spared.<br /><br />I almost feel like Maritn does not know where to go with the story, so he just creates some other conspiracy out of the blue to distract the reader for another four hundred pages. So if you are reading this review, I take it most likely you are where I am with your reading of this compendium, and there are things that just as I said don't make sense. Some things happen and you just have to wonder why Martin would make the characters act a certain way, for example:<br /><br />Where we left off with Forest Gump, errr......I mean Samwell Tarley (this was in A Feast for Crows): for some inexplicable reason before he left on a mission to Bravos he never told Jon Snow that his brothers were alive and well. Promise or no promise to Bran, if you had a best friend and had knowledge that his younger half-brothers were alive, wouldn't you just tell him, \\"Hey, don't tell anyone else, but your brothers are totally not dead.\\" As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, I think Jon could be trusted to keep mum.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to get in a lengthy spiel again about how the details are out of control again, so I cut straight into my own theories about what will possibly happen instead:<br /><br />Theory I - There are to be three Dragon Riders that constantly get mentioned. We have Dany, and her cousin who had been thought to have been killed when he was a baby. (Aegon), so that leaves one more needed Rider (Unless people or Dany just kills her dragon Drogon. Which I think she should do. I mean this dragon was killing kids and eating them. When a pet goes wild, you have to put it down. I mean look what they did to Lady, and Nimeria was the one that attacked Joeffrey.)  So anyway, I think that Jon Snow is really a Targaryen. I think his father was Rhagar, and Eddard  promised his sister on her death bed that he would tell no one, because he knew that Robert Baratheon would kill the child if he found out, so he hid the child the only way he could, by admitting that he had a marital indiscretion.<br /><br />Theory II - In the end Tyrion will rule the Seven Kingdoms. I like this one, just because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it. Kinda like, no matter how small, even a dwarf can do amazing things and save the world.<br /><br />Theory III - Eddard Stark is a green-seer and has really been alive this whole time, and he wakes up in a pool of sweat and it's all been a premonition dream, and as he wipes his brow dry he says, \\"Winter is coming.\\" - close curtain.just kills her dragon Drogon.

B004P1JEXE|4.0|Repetition, can be such a great thing. For example, when a great book is written and when a follow up novel comes out and continues to be amazing, I am happy for that repetitiveness. G.R.R. Martin does in fact write heavy laced plots that intertwine to the point you really don't know who you should root for anymore. I like the effect that he tries to pull off, and in many people it may indeed work. For example, a lot people seem to like the Kingslayer (Jaime Lannister) now. But anyway, just like its monstrous predecessors, Feast for Crows  contains other repetitions. There are phrases that again are repeated over and over. Everything seems to happen in \\"half a heartbeat\\", and Jon Snow's main reaction to dialogue is to \\"tighten his burned hand\\" and everywhere we turn there are \\"dark wings with dark words\\" most of the characters are \\"almost a woman or man grown\\", and finally \\"steel is singing against steel\\" in every battle.<br /><br />These are but a few of the repeated phrases heard in this book.  I read this book a while back so my memory is fading to what actually took place just in this novel, but having just wrapped up A Dance with Dragons the storyline is still fresh in my head. This novel, although shorter than the others, was not my favorite in the story telling department of the series, but it was my favorite regarding its length. However, this is only because he was forced to break this one down because the full novel was way too large. So Martin technically didn't succeed where I give him this credit.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the whole story line in general is still great and immersive, but where Martin succeed triumphantly in that area he fails again with too much detail. I have looked online to see family trees and relationships, at some point Martin needs to say enough is enough. There really is absolutely no need for the hundreds of characters that get mentioned in offhanded conversations that have no place in the plot. If he wants to introduce them later, fine toss in their backstory there. Martin's single flaw in my opinion would be his use of exposition. When a character makes an appearance he just babbles on and on about who this guy is in a long drawn out narrative. Most authors know it is best to show than tell, but Martin does a whole lot of telling in his books, so much so that after the lengthy backstory I totally forgot where the character was at. I'm being told about a battle this guy was in here, and how he raped some woman here and he fathered two children from a wedded wife and five from women he forced himself upon, then this same guy joined forces and called his banner-men to another war, and his horse was given to him by another high lord, and he had failed in combat while fighting for another higher lord's son. Then BAM we are back to where the scene opened, and I forgot he was sitting down to eat, with no doubt \\"grease running down and over his chin.\\" Do people not know how to eat without making a mess in these books? You'd think this noblemen and women would have been taught etiquette.<br /><br />Anyway, most people didn't like this novel also because many characters were left out. However knowing the reasons behind why that was done, I really didn't have a problem with that, because I knew I would be reading about their exploits in Dance with Dragons. So to keep up the repetitive cycle I grant this book a 4 star rating as well, losing a full star for the insane amount of exposition. When details go on for innumerable amounts of time I feel that a picture is no longer being drawn out for me, but a lecture is being thrown.em later, fine toss in their backstory there.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|This is the first book I've read by author: Denise Grover Swank, but it certainly won't be my last. I loved this story!<br /><br />A very original plot, with characters that are quirky, memorable and come to life with each page turned.<br /><br />A few reviewers have commented on the main character's personality traits as being a bit unbelievable.<br /><br />Yes Rose is: naïve, kind of \\"flaky\\" and immature for her age. But there is a reason for that. Her less than stellar upbringing and long-time living arrangements with her nasty mother, would tend to make anyone end up a bit strange. Underneath that shy façade, there is a woman to be reckoned with and just waiting to bloom. And Rose does just that, in spades!<br /><br />I've known people like Rose. People adapt and cope with less than ideal upbringings, in all sorts of ways and usually put off making necessary life changes, for a long time too.<br /><br />This book made me laugh, cry, sigh...and kept my interest right to the last page. I read a lot of romantic and transitional novels and this one has been one of the best I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Buy it, read it...you won't be sorry.<br /><br />PS: Love the cover too.

I have to say that I have read Khaled Hosseini before and know how he writes and was not disappointed.  It is a must read for an insight into the culture of Afghanistan  especially the  Taliban years where women were property and their lives were worthless.  I know as an American woman having lived through the liberation of women in this country, that is is difficult to imagine that this is still a huge part of the middle eastern culture.<br /><br />How these women were able to manage through those years with a tyrant for a husband and still come out in the end with some dignity is in itself a reason to pick up this book.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini writes an incredible novel.

0385743564|5.0|When a large explosion in the sky called Calamity gave some human beings on earth supernatural abilities, it was the hope of many that the Epics, as they came to be known, would use their abilities for the good of the world. They envisioned a world of real-life superheroes. But the opposite happened. The Epics only cared about themselves and some took the opportunity to use their power to dominate humanity. On the day that Steelheart, one of the most powerful Epics, turned against humanity, a young boy named David witnessed his father murdered by the Epic who would turn all of Chicago into his own steel empire. Years later, the sun no longer shines in the dark and oppressive city now called Newcago. David remembers the day his father died, and he's determined to join up with a group called the Reckoners to hunt down and kill Steelheart. David remembers something else from that fateful day. No one else knows about it. David saw Steelheart bleed.<br /><br />STEELHEART by Brandon Sanderson was one the best novels that I've ever read. The concept was brilliant, and Sanderson pulled it off so well.<br /><br />First of all, the fact that there are no good Epics was intriguing, as well as the questions it raises in the story. Did Calamity only give evil people abilities, or did receiving abilities make these people evil? Steelheart is a compelling villain who sees himself as a god. The other Epics are just as interesting, and I can't wait to see where Sanderson takes this story in future books (I believe it's supposed to be a trilogy).<br /><br />David knows he's seen Steelheart bleed, but he doesn't know exactly what it was that weakened Steelheart. He just knows that in the moment of being face-to-face with Steelheart, it'll all come back to him. It's this tenacity and overconfidence that drives him to pursue his goal at all costs, including the safety of his new comrades in the Reckoners.<br /><br />STEELHEART is a brilliant twist on the superhero story concept.

B003FCVF6I|5.0|When I was younger, I loved playing video games especially during the 1990s and early 2000s. I can even remember how, mainly during the sixth generation of consoles, my own addiction to the history and people of the video game industry. I could not get enough of it, even if I knew that I would never get to play many of the most popular games. With a book like The Ultimate History of Video Games, from the earliest days of arcades and the first consoles to the launch of Xbox, a great story is told.<br /><br />As the title of the book implies, the entire history of the video game industry is looked at. The first half of the book is pretty heavy on Atari. Nolan Bushnell plays a big part in Atari's early success. Many details are included such as Atari's internal affairs and how the budding industry got onto its feet. This led to the so-called golden age of video and arcade games in the early 1980s.<br /><br />After the North American video game crash in 1983, it would take a company from Japan, Nintendo, to rescue home video gaming. The rise of Nintendo is detailed in the book along with its fierce competition with, and eventual dominance of, Sega. The book ends with the release of three major consoles in the early 2000s: Sony's PlayStation 2, Nintendo's GameCube, and Microsoft's Xbox.<br /><br />Throughout the book, many individuals who played key parts in video game history are looked at and even interviewed. Many gamers have probably heard of men like Ralph Baer, Nolan Bushnell, and Shigeru Miyamoto, but many others played part not only in designing games but also the executives who ran companies.<br /><br />Not only are the major points in video game history looked at but also the minor side events that marked the way. Controversy is no stranger to video games and the book looks at the two times the U.S. Senate held hearings on the matter. Companies would sue each other, or at least threaten, for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />I thought this book was an excellenthistory of video games for the period of time it covered. Although the previous twelve years are not covered due to when this book was published, the historical information available is invaluable. My only disappointment with the book was that I felt too much coverage was given to Atari and not enough to other companies at the time, such as Coleco. However, the sheer amount of information available more than made up for it. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of video games.

B000GIXLO8|5.0|First of all, I bought this as a gift for a close friend with whom I subsequently watched all three movies (all in this extended/theatrical combo edition.) The movie comes as 2 discs, as the extended editions are LONG. The only downside is that you have to switch discs halfway through the movies -- sort of made me nostalgic for cassette tapes from back in the day.<br /><br />The box is a sturdy cardboard case with a transparent window which shows through to the image you can see in the Amazon picture.<br /><br />As to the movies themselves, I think it goes without saying that they're great. I pick up new things every time I watch these, and now I can do that on my own time, rather than waiting for the waste-your-entire-Sunday marathons that don't even show the full extended editions!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|While the Cromecast is easy to install without clear instructions, it is NOT a substitute for an HDMI cable.  Sadly there is no mouce tracking and you can only watch once your movie has been chosen on your laptop.  It's ok, worth the $30 but not what I was hoping for.
B00EDPFJA4|2.0|Nothing Was The Same is the third studio album by Drake and after Take Care, he has set the bar pretty high for himself. Nothing Was The Same doesn't even come close to that bar he has set for himself. With awful production and an overall boring premise, you're in for a long repetitive ride.<br />Beats [D-] Awful almost all the way through. Hold On We're Coming Home is the only saving grace here.<br />Hooks [F] From Started From The Bottom to All Me, it's boring, lazy and overall would have been better if left unattempted<br />Flow [B] One of the better parts of the album, Drake is able to stay on top of the beats well, but especially on songs like Started From The Bottom, he sounds High the whole time, it's decent overall but not great.<br />Lyrics [A] The only saving grace on this album. Drake goes incredibly deep with some of these lyrics, which is to be appreciated with the Rap game so repetitive now-a-days<br />Originality [B+] It's original all right. But that doesn't mean it's good. You won't hear an album like this one, and though it's deep, the production is pretty bad.<br />Guest Features [C] Forgettable to say the least. Jhene Aiko and Majid Jordan were the only two that made a difference here and the rest were just \\"whatever\\" features.<br />Singles [F] Started From The Bottom was an atrocity to rap music and only furthers the stereotype that Drake is a bad rapper (Which he isn't by any means). All Me was probably the laziest and most stereotypical rap song of the year. Wu-Tang Forever is just straight up boring, while Hold On We're Going Home stands as the only song worth listening to of the four. Unfortunately, those four songs were the only ones that had any mainstream potential.<br /><br />Nothing Was The Same is without a doubt Drake's weakest album to date. With Take Care being so original and enjoyable most of the way through, it's disappointing to see Drake release such a repetitious and boring album that has absolutely no excitement at all. Yeahthe lyrics are great, but production wise, this album is just awful.<br /><br />FINAL SCORE: 4/10<br /><br />Must Have Songs:<br />Hold On, We're Going Home<br />Come Thru<br />Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2<br /><br />Author's Note: I absolutely hate Young Money, but I honestly think that Drake is the only member of the team that has any sort of potential. As I stated in the review, Take Care was fantastic, as I actually listened to it while writing this review. But this is probably one of the most boring albums I have ever listened to. I'm not a hater of Drake, but this album was incredibly disappointing.

0783219733|5.0|the dog that every one loves.  you will remember how they got the dog.  one family movie truly wonderful the dog that is the boss of the family.
B00E95ED32|5.0|This is the an absolutely wonderful album. Every track is perfect in its own way. Excellent excellent excellent album. I highly recommend it to everyone.
0061780308|5.0|GREAT STORY.  A FAIRY TALE.  ONE THAT WILL KEEP YOUR INTEREST AND NOT BORE YOU.  WHEN I LISTENED TO IT I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN AND HAD A 3 HOUR DRIVE TO THE VA HOSPITAL.  THE STORY KEPT ME AWAKE ON THE DRIVE AND TOOK MY MIND OFF MY MISERY.  AWESOME STORY!  WORTH EVERY PENNY I PAID.
1423140605|5.0|My 11 year old LOVES these books.  Need I say anything more.  I see that book 4 is available now so I am about to order that one as well.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|This movie was rented by my husband, I thought I was into kids movies, but this one did not cut it for me. Maybe something not for a 28 year old woman with no kids... just saying.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great quality video, occasionally the sound is out of sync.<br />Set up is a smooth as it gets.<br />The cost would be great if it didn't mean I purchased a separate TV to ChromeCast my Chrome tab too while watching football.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I loved this flick, it had action, magic and Isla Fisher, totally worth watching and recommned it to anyone to watch.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The writing, directing, and acting in Season 1 make this an unusual and captivating sci fi series.  It is strangely believable, yet still far enough &#34;out there&#34; to be fun.  Loved it.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I rated the future earth movies like this:<br />Oblivion #1<br />Elysium #2<br />AfterEarth #3<br />so check this one out, it is good.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I CAN ONLY IMAGINE THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH REZA MUST HAVE DONE TO BE ABLE TO CONVEY ALL OF THE HISTORICAL DETAILS IN THIS BOOK.<br /><br />IT IS CLEAR THAT TIME ALONE WILL MOST DEFINITELY CHANGE A HISTORICAL ACCOUNT.  ZEALOT DIVES DEEPLY INTO HISTORY, PEELING AWAY THE LAYERS OF MYTH AND EXAGERATIONS WHICH THROUGH THE YEARS HAVE TURNED JESUS INTO &#34;THE SON OF GOD&#34;.

B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I enjoy playing this game it is relaxing.  There are some glitches though that i wis they would fix.  Other than that it is great!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The synopsis:<br /><br />It at least works most of the time, and I basically got what I paid for - a $35 piece of plastic that plugs into a port on my TV and lets me send YouTube videos to it.<br /><br />The good (praises):<br /><br />* Setup was easy.  Plugged into my TV, and was pretty much painless to setup with an Android smartphone.<br /><br />* Getting the device to play YouTube videos and Play Music audio is straightforward and pretty simple to figure out.<br /><br />The bad (condemnations):<br /><br />* YouTube playback is awful.  Not only that, it's *inconistently* awful.  It's one thing when every single video experiences stuttering, but in this case, it seems like some videos play great and others - for no explicable reason whatsoever - mysteriously start stuttering.  It doesn't help that there's no easy way to install YouTube Center (or some equivalent) on this thing to disable YouTube's poorly-implemented DASH functionality; thus, it's not possible to pause the video and wait for it to buffer.  Thanks, Google!<br /><br />*** As an addendum to the above, VEVO's ads play without any issue whatsoever.  Y'all know that meme image that shows a massive datacenter for YouTube ads and an old 80386 desktop for the YouTube videos?  Yeah, the truth in that joke is more prevalent than anyone could possibly imagine...<br /><br />* When using the Play Music app, playback works fine when connecting to the Chromecast first, *then* playing a song.  Switch this around, and the Play Music app crashes upon trying to connect to the Chromecast.  This is probably a limitation of the Play Music app, however.<br /><br />The ugly (nitpicks):<br /><br />* The reconfiguration portion of the Chromecast app (i.e. for changing network details / device name, viewing license info, etc.) doesn't respond to touches half the time, making it a nightmare to reconfigure the device.<br /><br />* Zero Firefox support is lame, but at least I went in expecting this.  At least it's not too hard to launch a Chrome session if I want to send web pages to the thing.<br /><br />* Zero ability to change the backgrounds on the \\"Ready to Cast\\" screen.  Not *that* big of a deal, but I hope Google implements this in the future; I'd much prefer to have some of my own photos on there.<br /><br />* Zero ability to stream arbitrary files/streams, i.e. from one's local device.  I suppose I'll have to wait for a suitable app (and hope that said app doesn't get removed.  Thanks, Google!).<br /><br />The conclusion:<br /><br />* You get what you pay for.  If you want something more capable, I reckon you'd be better off with one of those full-Android plug computers.<br /><br />* My four-year-old niece could probably throw together a more competently-designed ARM-based Linux and stick it onto a Raspberry Pi, and it would only cost $20 or so more to do, SD card / HDMI cable / USB cable / USB-to-mains adapter inclusive.  The hardware's great, but Google really dropped the ball on the software - which somehow doesn't surprise me, come to think of it, now that I recall the various services that have gone to crap lately (*coughcough*YouTube*cough*).<br /><br />* Given that the majority of the issues I've been running into are software-based, I hope to someday be able to edit this review and bump up the number of stars.  Until then, the 3-star rating is generous.
1626810915|5.0|YOU GOT TO READ THIS BOOK.  YOU WILL LEARN AT LEAST ONE THING!  I LEARNED ALOT FROM THIS BOOK.  AN IT WAS INSPIRING AND MOTIVATIONAL.  I'M THE BEST READER IN THE WORLD, BUT IT TOOK ME TWO DAYS TO FINISH READING THIS BOOK.  YOU GUYS HAVE TO READ IT!
B000VI12ZS|2.0|It seems to me that showing so much blood and guts isn't necessary for a movie.  Special affects were not very convincing.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|Have used this book for years to have insight into behavior and &#34;story&#34; of others as well as myself.  One of the best relationships books too for understanding, compassion, problem solving.  I recommend it to everyone and use it weekly!
B00BURWSG6|5.0|This is just another example of Timmo's habilities to create outstanding music. Since his departure from Stratovarius, he has been composing music for Revolution Rennaisance and Symphonia (They no longer exist). The music from this album, it is just GREAT, OUTSTANDING, etc..!!! The mastermind of Stratovarius took seriously the production, the composing of the music and everything that involves creatitivy with outstanding singers. I have no words to describe this album, becasuse is absolutely amazing!!!
B008JFUUIA|5.0|feel good, makes me happy. Have watched it over 20 times, it gets better the more you watch it, I swear!

B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book is very interesting and brings up a lot of questions for me that I had been asking for years.  I will read more from other sources.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|This deck of cards is amazing! The design is wonderful, and the cards are quality. Stored in a solid plastic box, my cat cannot eat them while I am not home. Delivery was quick from Japan, and the cards were packaged carefully.  The crane I received with the package was a wonderful surprise. :) The gesture was very much appreciated and made my day so much better. Thank you.
B006UN3K4O|5.0|Provides insight on how men and women can communicate better to sustain a relationship.  Beneficial to all who are in love.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Look anywhere online, and my review will be a mirror of the vast majority out there: absolutely love the series, and absolutely hate that it came to an abrupt end.
B00594XOZU|3.0|I had this app on my android phone and on my first Kindle. I bought a new Kindle yesterday and now I cant log in or set up a new KIK account. Whats up?
B00F2362IE|5.0|Like an earlier reviewer mentioned, if it's taking forever to download or load while playing, or even lags then you need to remove useless apps or old games that are taking up space on your device. I downloaded the iron man 3 game and it was the same exact situation with bad reviewers and what needed to be done to play. If you have the same problem then do yourself a favor and remove a few less than great games from your device and try again. There are 2 kindle fires in our household and the game works flawlessly on both after doing as mentioned. To the few that have the problem of buying the game and it not showing up on their kindle I'm sure it's because it was bought online and they didn't push sync on their device... Also the complaint about not being able to play as all of the characters and having to pay for them is ridiculous, just like most games out you have to earn coins by playing to unlock different characters and upgrades(2700 coins to unlock additional turtles, which is very reasonable considering the game is addicting and at an average of 150-200 coins per run you're looking at around 14-18 runs to reach that goal). Don't get it twisted, this is a great game and having to play over and over to unlock new and better things is what keeps you wanting to play. Anyone who is considering purchasing this game and is reading the bad reviews should take everything above in consideration before they pass this game up. Hope this helps. Enjoy. TMNT!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Justin always sounds so romantic and smooth.  This is a good album with a country feel.  Very nice rendition of his songs.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I played this game on my computer a long time ago and I loved it!! great to have it on my phone!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Very useful item.  Glad to have it for my Kindle.  This is something that will be used with my computer.

B000SEFCD8|5.0|Reading this book could save the lives of dogs and may change the way you think about your relationship with dogs. This author provides easy-to-understand, valuable information about the behavior of dogs, something we humans who share our lives with dogs desperately need. Understanding dog behavior makes training or just sharing life with them more joyful and fulfilling for both creatures!  As someone who volunteers to help rescue Jindo dogs and volunteers in the local shelter I feel compelled to be a better human companion to these amazing creatures, dogs, who are willing to share their lives with humans. I've been around dogs, raising, training, pet-sitting them for most of my life and I wish I'd read this book when I was a 10 yr. old. Still, I'm grateful to have come across Patricia McConnell's work. She has a website that I also recommend to anyone with dogs.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|excellent book, much easer than my book on windows for learning. It walked me right through every step, wonderful book.
B003V1WUKS|2.0|They made a movie out of this!?!? Seriously?!? C'mon, goblin, you must do better than this if you want to call yourself a writer!  This is a collection of hard to follow stories, written in a random first person mode, which keep you waiting for the moment when everything coalesces into one and it makes sense....well, it never does. So maybe it works for those of us who think that the rainbow is better than the pot of gold, for everyone else this will be book-us chaoticus interruptus. If you like crazy stream of consciousness stories, stick to the Master
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Kindle Fire HD:  If I am lucky, it freezes at the log in screen.  Otherwise it freezes before log in screen can pop up.  It has locked up the tablet as well, even after a reboot.
B000002KHF|5.0|Who couldn't like this album and artist.  Wonderful to put you in a good mood.  I definitely recommend for any mood
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very entertaining! I definitely recommend this game to anyone. Has time played energy levels. Several types of search games with mini puzzles as well.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|Like I said the movies awesome Always loved it but when I got it today I noticed the case has a huge crack running along the back of it which is why I gave it 3 out of 5 but the movie itself 5 out of 5
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The movie was very well played out. The plot made sense and the movie was very easy to follow. WOW!!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put the book down. Loved every minute of it and could not wait to find out the secret, of course I did kind of figure it out before it was revealed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Grand Kids can't get enough of this game! The twin boys have to be put on a time limit.
B00486070K|5.0|Light and compact, it does exactly what it is supposed to.  Connections feel secure.  Exactly what I needed to connect my macbook pro in a non-wireless environment.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|I haven't been enraptured by a DT album since Scenes From a Memory (live and studio).  This one may do it.  Tracks 2 and 3 are awesome, and the rest is great.  Some hooks, great riffs, and exercising of the musical muscles without getting too far out there for too long.  If you like DT, get this album.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Fun fast paced game.<br />Very colorful. I can only go so far and then I'm done. too fast for me to excel.
1592402038|4.0|After reading chapter three of Eats, Shoots & Leaves by Lynne Truss, I became very aware of how little I actually knew about commas!  There is a brief, yet informative, section at the beginning of the chapter about the history of the comma.  Apparently, the comma went through many changes until a Venetian printer, Aldus Manutius the Elder, invented a standard system of punctuation which was later tweaked and improved by his grandson, Aldus Manutius the Younger.  Their work made books more enjoyable and easier to read.<br /><br />Although Truss' writing style was somewhat dry at times, it was very informative and I picked up some useful tips on punctuation that will help me in my writing.  For example, I was not aware of the Oxford comma, an optional comma before the word \\"and.\\"  Personally, I really enjoy the use of commas and found some parts of this chapter humorous.  I would recommend this reading to anyone interested in improving their punctuation skills, learning more about the elusive comma, and any grammar aficionados out there!
B0058VW36U|1.0|I downloaded this to my mind about a year ago. It worked fine...but I was getting to old for it. I uninstalled it. Now, I want to play it again, so I download it again. I open it happily. (Very excited) It crashes once I open it. I try that again 5 times. Do not buy, is a ripoff ! It sa very fun game, but it crashed on my Kindle.
0399226907|5.0|You can't miss with Eric Carle and this is one of his best.  Good story beautifully illustrated and great for a variety of ages.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|Nothing seems to happen ....I kept reading as I hoped for some excitement or an unpredictable event.  Women are dull and don't seem to have depth.  As a native Long Islander I became inspired to visit some of the locations....maybe have a drink at The Olde Towne Tavern if there is one
0805092447|5.0|A great &#34;Read Aloud&#34; for the little ones, and a perfect &#34;Early Reader&#34; for those a little older.  The illustrations are wonderful!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|But the story is unfinished. A lot of time spent killing off main characters. Can't wait for the next book.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book hammers home the truth whether big business wants to hear it or not. You can map brain shrinkage against your A1C levels.
1936608898|5.0|I've been wanting to go Paleo/Primal for quite some time now, and this book really helped me learn the necessary facts about /why/ doing this is such a good idea. This book is absolutely wonderful and a must read for anyone wanting to change their eating habits!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This was a reload onto a new device. I 've had this application for a year or two and use it on my tablet for studies and while in Church. Many versions available and it's FREE!  I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a Bible application on their phone, tablet or other device.
B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I purposely avoid this movie in theaters, I didn't want to see another zoombie movie.  I made a mistake. It appeared to be a 3D movie. I wish I had seen it in IMAX
B0008ENICU|5.0|Dated, but still a great watch.  A star filled cast for that era.  Never should have tried to do a remake - it stunk.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author has a brilliant ability to bring the voices of her characters alive. The story had an authentic feel right from the start. I can believe that the words flowed from the heart. Together with her research and the use of the two voices, the book kept me riveted to the end. I would welcome a sequence.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Based on a true story and very interesting.  Top notch actors doing a great job with a lot of charisma between them.
1250012570|5.0|Eleanor and Park are two misfits, different in their own ways. Itfs 1986, and Eleanor is new to the school. Overweight, with bright red hair, and dressed very peculiarly, she does not fit in and is constantly picked on. Park, quiet and unusual, reluctantly and slowly becomes her first friend with the sharing of comic books and music on the bus. Soon and unexpectedly, they begin to fall in love, despite Eleanorfs painful and abusive home life, which often causes her to be angry and push Park away. This is a sweet, yet dark, story of first love.<br /><br />What a fantastic book! I love, love, LOVED both Eleanor and Park. I loved Eleanor because she was bold and strange and misunderstood. I loved Park because he was sweet and different and compassionate. I love that he loved Eleanor, despite how screwed up she was. I love how their relationship evolved from nothing to everything. I love how intense, real, and deep their love was, and that it was not instantaneous. This story was so sweet and beautiful, but also dark and gloomy, an interesting combination providing a great balancec not sticky-sweet, but not completely overshadowed by sadness all the time either. When one element was gaining speed, the other would come and knock it down a notch. I loved that. It was sad and dark in that Eleanor is tortured at both home and school. Itfs painful to see her attacked on so many levels, by so many people, and rarely see her defend herself. Itfs sweet in that Park loves her despite everything, and itfs sweet to see their relationship grow and see Eleanor feel accepted for once in her life.<br /><br />While this book is marketed as YA, I wonder if that was really the authorfs intentions. True, the book is about teens, but it has some really adult elements to it, and a lot of 80s references that are even too old for ME, and Ifm 24. That said, I think this book has a ton of crossover appeal, and that both teens (particularly older teens) and adults will both enjoy it. If youfre the kind of person who roots for the underdog, or has ever felt like a misfit, you will absolutely love this book. The first 75 pages or so were a bit slow for me, but after that, I couldnft put it down, and read the last couple hundred pages in one night. I just really enjoyed reading about that wonderful gfirst loveh sensation and all of the accompanying feelings. I highly recommend it!he kind of person who roots for the underdog, or has ever felt like a misfit, you will absolutely love this book.

6302470021|5.0|This film is a total mishmosh with no relation to the Ian Fleming &#34;Casino Royale&#34;.  It is absolutely hilarious with tons of crazy happenings and many top actors.  See something new everytime I watch it!
B00AHHODH2|2.0|2.5/5<br /><br />Gordonston, in Savannah, Georgia, is a picturesque neighborhood that is hiding a lot of secrets under its beautiful exterior. From the widowed women in the Ladies Dog Walking Club, to the beautiful model-like neighbor, everyone has a secret to hide, and everyone is seeking revenge...<br /><br />I was instantly intrigued by this book as soon as I heard the title and saw the adorable dog on the cover. You all know that I am dog-obsessed, and anything having to do with dogs has my instant attention! Well, I was delighted to find that this book was full of dogs... and their shady owners! While the book didn't center on the dogs, I did love all the mentions of them. Anyways, aside from the dogs, this book is full of one mystery and one secret after the other! Kind of in like one of my all time favorite shows, Desparate Housewives, every single person in this neighborhood, it seemed, had a dirty little secret that they would do anything to hide... maybe even kill. A lot of the secrets and mysteries weren't unraveled until the very end, which I thought was very cool.<br /><br />While I enjoyed a lot of aspects about this book, I sometimes felt a bit overwhelmed by all that was going on and by the abundance of characters. I think there were just a few too many stories going on with all the neighbors, and I would have liked to see the story focus on just a couple of the residents instead, though a lot of the stories did end up tying together by the end. Though not perfect, this was a good first effort by Duncan Whitehead if you're a fan of mysteries and dogs!<br /><br />Note: I received a copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.
0783225482|5.0|Corny but funny.  Kind of a satire on women who don't want to age and will do anything to prevent it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An expertly crafted and interwoven story of three families with unsuspecting twists which ultimately tie together. I especially enjoyed this author style with teasers and hints and then divert your attention in another direction. This book will lead you to question your family, friends and aquaintences. Ah, if we only knew the secrets behind the smiles and friendly \\"good morning's\\". This is my first book by Laine Moriarty and I can hardly wait to read another, but first I have to read this book again.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|what can one say about a product that works quickly and efficiently behind the scene with no indication it is doing the job?
B002N5N4MG|5.0|Great season of the TBBT!!! Excellent show and the actors are great, Howard and of course Sheldon were my favorite.
B00ET9T2WK|1.0|don't say something is free if it isn't.  Put this on my new kindle for a tryout and then learned it is a pay as you go plan. bleh
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Excellent game. Fun to play and some nice challenges, especially the trophies. There's lots of humor and the graphics are also smooth and well done.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I started using yahoo everything when it was one of the better search engines.  They now change the format of whatever they wish and you have to live with it.  No input and not much customer service.  I only stay with Yahoo mail because of long list of contacts, friends and family who use my yahoo address to contact me, it would be a huge hassle to change and that's all.
B009FA98JU|1.0|I'm so disappointed at this time, I have been using Amazon since 2005 and all the products have been pretty good, but not this one,<br /><br />I bought this DVI adapter because the \\"good\\" reviews and because it says that It's coming from Apple, and I received a fake Apple Mini DisplayPort to DVI, this adapter feels 'cheap' and is broken! It's not working at all !!.<br /><br />I had to buy another DVI adapter (a real one) which means I spent $29 more.<br /><br />I just don't know what to do with this useless adapter.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this item! I just lost my time and money.
B00CHNKJFO|1.0|This is for Amazon Kindle fire (New Generation tablets only?) For a $2 game I would expect this to work on all Android based tablets. For the same price I can get the same game on Google Play which should have worked on all the Android devices that I own. Amazon says incompatible for original Kindle fire too? I hope this is a mistake done by developer or Amazon. If this is a marketing plot then nobody wins!<br /><br />I cannot play this game on about 10 Android devices I own and hence zero stars! I hope Amazon fixes this soon and If it starts to work on my other Android tablets I own I will revise my rating accordingly.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Hi<br /><br />I am using the VTube app for the last 1 month,<br />and noticed following issues.<br /><br />1) The search facility is very poor , after the first page of results<br /> if you scroll down , it just displays , \\"loading..\\", but nothing shows.<br />so far even one time it didn't load anything after the first displayed results.<br /><br />2) The download feature is great . but if you have downloaded more videos like 6 GB,<br />  and try to see the cached videos offline, u can access few of them, if you have the internet<br />it just loades the full list , but in either case the content is played from cached repository.<br />i guess , it just stores the index files of the downloaded files on cloud .
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Love this app he is so cute to play around with would be great in regular mode and kid mode
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|Nice game so far.  Plays through quickly because it shows you your possible moves.  I hope to find a setting to turn that function off.  If you are just learning to play it's a great feature.  But if you already know how, it seems to take away some of the challange.
B000056PWV|5.0|JImmy Stewart is confined to a wheel chair therefore most of the movie takes place in his apartment. Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter carry out all the action outside the Rear Window. Suspense if good and no one can Beat Jimmy Stewart.
6305949980|5.0|i absolutely love this move! always have since i can remember! came on time and so so excited about it!
042524489X|3.0|I felt about this book the way i felt about G.A Aiken Dragon Kin 6 Eibhear and Izzy's story.There was just a great build-up but when the time came it felt like a big letdown.My least favorite book of the series.
B001NHNG64|5.0|This book had a good pace and the story was believable. Lee Child has created a great character with Jack Reacher and you find yourself gritting your teeth while he gets from one tight spot to another. Very enjoyable!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|This is the first DT album I've given five stars since 6DoIT.  What I like about this new album is that it is fresh and different, yet still classic DT.  There are no insipid lyrics, Portnoy raps or George Michael styled breathy vocals.  The last few Portnoy releases were becoming a bit stale and uninspired.  The whole band seems reenergized and it shows here.  ADToE showed some real promise.  I did have some issues with it.  Too many ballads and the drums seemed under recorded but an overall improvement.  This time out they have returned to what I expect from this band.  Great songs performed at a level few if any could match.  No song by song narrative, I liked them all at first listen.  But I do have to give a shout out regarding \\"Illumination Theory\\", it's a monster!
B00005JMYI|5.0|Best movie of all time and best buy of all time as well! The movie came in harmless and disc was shiny clean! works great!
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Being a hard core Trekkie, I was surprised that this prequel didn't really jive with what happened in the original Star Trek episode with Ricardo Montalban
B0063M22QO|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME. HAVE PLAYED IT FOR YEARS!!!! WORTH THE DOLLAR! Recommend good time killer.<br />Now I just have to keep writing something so I can submit this review.

B0060ANOXY|5.0|I try my hardest not to listen to this album anymore. Why? Because it is so good and I fear getting tired of it. I am listening to the truly incredible HQ vinyl version but I am sure a regular CD will move you just the same. If you want to listen to some of the most amazing and moving music ever produced; if you enjoy listening to modern poetry of the most depressing kind containing the words that describe very accurately the strange world in which we live; if you love earth shattering sonics, raging dynamics and beautiful melodies all rapped up in probably the finest concept album of all time then make sure that you do one more thing in your life. Get this album, listen to it a number of times, read the lyrics, close your eyes and absorb the music and sheer splendour of this masterpiece and then put it away only to be listened to when you have time to listen to it in its entirety, with a glass of fine red wine in one hand and the album cover in the other and, if possible, with the amplifier turned up extremely loud! Simply stunning! Roger you've done it again!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|This show started so many things, and was beyond ahead of it's time.  To date, there has not been something, as gripping, as nail biting, as weird, and as original as Twin Peaks.  This show broke the mold not just on detective drams, but prime time and television writing as we knew it.  I could go on and on and back up my claims, but I have to get back to life, and I think if you give it a shot, you'll see what I mean for yourself.  This show holds the test of time, and is in itself timeless.
0802473156|5.0|&#34;I learned more about my spouse in 2 weeks than I had in the previous 18 years of marriage&#34;. That was the quote from a friend of mine who was contemplating a divorce after some marriage issues. I gave him the book which I had read years ago.  This book is great!!!!
1623650003|4.0|This is quite a good story, with lots of twists and turns and surprises, but they are not 'Deus ex Machina' things.  It is translated from the French, and some of the translation is odd.  The policeman is a little wiry guy, 4 foot 11, and his boss is a big fat guy, maybe 280 pounds.  Get ready... the policeman is maybe 50 pounds less (maybe it works in metric).  If he is 4 foot 11 and 230 pounds, he is a bowling ball.  I had a boyfriend who was 5 foot 9 and 130 something, so 4 foot 11 must weigh a whole lot less.<br /><br />Anyway, once you get past the odd translation (I guess) things, it is really absorbing.  But every once in a while, something pops up strange.  Too bad they didn't have a native English-speaking editor.<br /><br />But I highly recommend the book.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Maggie Smith is always great.  Good story line, poignant, and humorus. I wish the powers that be would do a Miss Marple series with her as Miss Marple, she would be the best ever.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|Music and lyrics on this album are romantic in nostalgic sense. I enjoy this album a lot. Slow and even sensual.
B001EO748M|3.0|These folks just worked too hard for sex. It shouldn't be that difficult to achieve an orgasm. Aside from that I like the era, the history and the costumes.
B001PEY9EI|1.0|downloaded twice and it never worked on my computer so my experience was non existent and I don't know how to get a refund...
1452126577|5.0|I love this book! Views from a cat.Read from cover to cover.Could not put it down. Laugh the hold time.
0439796636|5.0|I bought it for a gift and the person likes it. Very good book and i recommended to all that like to read.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I did not want to stop reading. It had me at the edge of my seat. Percy is a crazy awkward charecter. And don't even get me started about Smelly Gabe. It is an insanely good book. :)  By Portia B. 9 years old
0440246016|5.0|Lee Child's books are great fun to read. Reacher is a well created character. Books are clean which I like. Lot's of action and intrigue. The old special forces group creates an platform for the plot. Great ending.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Awesome app. It really helps me fall asleep on those many restless nights. Except this one, which is why I am writing this review. But it generally works.
B00634GHJA|5.0|Very good app to down load. I use this sight all the time with my Kindle.very easy to use good quality.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|That this film is not better known and rated more highly is a crime!<br />The movie manages to combine the style of 1950s science fiction and film noir in one package. It then sets this in an atmosphere of the 1940s, while making use of up to date special effects.<br />Rufus Sewell and even more William Hurt play their role to perfection, while Jennifer Connelly, as always, is a sight for sore eyes.  The visual artistry of the movie is stunning, the story gripping, and the music score right on target.<br />I really like everything about this movie, and to top it all the director's cut blu-ray has not one but three commentary tracks as well as a number of documentaries. This is a must buy, especially if you like science fiction.
B008UWEFU6|5.0|I loved the books! The company I ordered from worked with me also! This is a must read for everyone!
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Greatest show on Earth.  You don't have to be a genius to figure out these are insanely great movies.  Buy this, yo.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|That's how I'll describe KOL new album. It has a nice mixture of songs and each song has a completely different style. I love it! My favorites are Wait for me, Family Tree, Beautiful War and Comeback Story.<br /><br />They also did a Great cover of Robyn's \\"Dancing On MY Own\\" check it out on Youtube
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Wonderfully atmospheric and emotionally intense - truly can't guess who did it.  Anxiously awaiting final show - I hope the payoff is worth the pain.
B00136Q1I0|3.0|good value for the number of songs you get. would like to change some songs for other songs but this is ok.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Have set it up on TV but have not sent any info yet.  Need more time to make sure it work.
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|I downloaded this app because the built in video player on my phone wouldn't stream a video  from my home network. It would play it but had to download it first. Good Player has done that (streamed) with no problem. I had no problem installing it and have seen no sign of pop-up ads. The play back is smooth and the controls work nicely.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|Son loves this app, we had to purchase the other letters, however the puzzles are awesome.  This a great app for letter recognition.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This is a fun little game with good replay value. There are some annoying bringe however, like finding old quest items over and over again in the pictures.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Really enjoyed the Zombies.  Fresh.  Thought the ending was typical of apocalyptic movies.  NO resolution which would be nice for a change of pace IMHO.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I highly recommend everyone read this book when you have a spare moment. You will not be able to set it down until it is finished.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|As much as I love the movie it doesn't do justice to the book. What a great story and outlook on a sport I've loved for so many years.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|this game is awesome so addicting I love eating all of the ducks. AMAZING! graphics are really cool to. to sum it up GET THIS GAME
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|dumb ways to die is a really fun game it is kind of hard. it is a really fun game. if you like to laugh you should check out the dumb ways to die video. the only down side is that if toy have a kindle like me you cant do the plane level but if you go into settings you can turn the plane level off then you don't have to fale it. this game is super fun I'm sure you will love it I would give it 5000 stars if I could I'm sure that you will love this game

B002MQYOFW|1.0|The Hunger Games is an AMAZING book!! I couldn't put it down!!!! I would give it ten stars if I could. Don't listen to the 1 star reviews on this book, just read the book it's amazing . I won't give any spoilers but you just HAVE TO READ IT!!!!  Well I could go on and on about how fabulous this book is but I don't want to spoil it for you. I just HAVE to say GREAT JOB SUZANNE COLLINS!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I already read the books and fell in love with the series. There's nothing that I dislike, or hate, about them. They're well written.<br /><br />And I would recommend these books to anyone who likes suspense, a bit of horror, hot guys (lol), and romance.<br /><br />Give \\"The Hunger Games\\" a chance. Then tell me if you don't care about the series.<br /><br />Because I can guarantee that you'll like it and be hooked for life.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I learned to play Solitaire when I was a little girl and have continued to like it all my life.  I have whiled away a lot of hours playing the game and like the automatic moving of the cards.  I would recommend this version to any of my Solitaire loving friends.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Finally (for me at least) some reasonable light on the subject of the title.<br />I appreciate that the book provides some historical data to support its conclusions.<br />And that it is full of interesting comparisons between societies that<br />show light on the reasons behind the differential development.
