0140284087|4.0|P.G. Wodehouse's CARRY ON, JEEVES, is a masterpiece of hilarity! Jeeves is Bertram (Bertie) Wooster's manservant in jolly old England. Jeeves is always there to get poor Bertie out of his farcical jams. This book was first published in 1925, but the comedy plays out just as well today. I especially love the variety of turns of phrases that pop up on every page. (Imagine being described by Bertie as: &quot;As vague and woollen-headed a blighter as ever bit a sandwich.&quot;!) Each of the ten short chapters is another adventure, with the last adventure being told from Jeeve's own point of view. I highly recommend this book, and I can't wait to read the others in the series!

0345452577|1.0|Look, if you want to read a good mystery, stick to Kellerman's early work.  &quot;Butcher's Theater&quot; is dynamite.  This one is pretty darned close to a remake (at least in terms of the villian's MO), but nowhere as imaginative or intriguing.  It's time for Kellerman to retire his word processor.
B00005AUBA|5.0|Mogwai - Rock Action.<BR>  Se trata de un disco oscuro, de texturas muy bien logradas estilo Pink Floyd o lo que Radiohead pudo haber logrado en Amnesiac. Al parecer Mogwai se mete al estudio para recopilar algunos exorcismos que habian olvidado en los pasados discos. Pero Rock Action compila canciones extremas como Take Me Somewhere Nice (una obra de arte y la mejor de Mogwai). Si escuchas detenidamente cada uno de los temas, veras que encierra una pequea proporcion del pasado discografico de Mogwai. En fin podria decir mucho acerca de ellos pero diria que el disco en su totalidad es tremendamente bueno... aunque falta ver que sale despues de este disco que denomiria como puestas melancolicas, torcidas, toxicas y hasta viajentes por momentos. Es fascinante encontrarse con discos de tal magnitud artistica.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is one of the greatest releases of 2003 starring Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson, and Giovanni Ribisi.  It deservingly garnered three Golden Globe wins (Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay) and four Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Original Screenplay).  Its plot of an American actor popular in the 1970's who finds peace in Japan is brilliant and original.  The emotional aspects are heavily present, namely Bob Harris (Murray) being away from his family and Charlotte (Johansson) becoming increasingly lonely due to her husband not being present often.  The combination of the two storylines come together smoothly, especially when the two characters become soulmates.  The dramatic aspects keep audience interested in every moment.  Such movie quality marks director Sofia Coppola at her career best so far.  Bill Murray marks a triumphant comeback in this movie.  Though well known as a comedian, he shines in this dramatic role.  No other actor could have performed his role better.  Scarlett Johansson marks a brilliant career launcher in her role.  She proves that she'll continue becomine well-known as a wonderful actress in the future.  &quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is great for those looking for an original drama.  Because of the immense movie depth, audiences may have to watch this multiple times to catch every detail.  Afterwards, many will be glad they did.

B000003C5C|5.0|Well people, Metal just doesn't come in a more crystalized form. You won't find any Punk influence, meatheaded Hard rock or obnoxious Glam rock and Power metal nonsense here, just 100% METAL. This is a PERFECT Death metal album chock full of conviction, hooks, good lyrics, and good musicianship (although it doesn't hold a candle to the proficiency displayed on ITP, Symbolic and TSOP). I can't imagine anyone with a taste for pure Metal disliking this. If you like this, I also recommend listening to Vomitory and Pestilence. \\"Let the metal flow\\"-Chuck Schuldiner

Si lo escuchas detenidamente te daras cuenta de la historia y momentos que te relatan con la musica, me fascinan  discos como este puesto que llevan una secuencia entre la musica y no termina una cuando ya empieza la otra. Entre los tracks contamos con algunos sonidos clasicos y basicos que se hallan en la historia de la banda, si es que sabes de ellos, y para los que no, pues lo siento.

B0000029GA|5.0|All I can say I cant take this cd out my cdplayer at all. If you havent heard this album and you claim you love hip-hop, think again.This album is really the definition of hip hop, The beats are produced by the finest producers such as Large professor and Dj Premiere. The lyrics are amazing, especially the lyrics to one love, Its about a letter written to a friend in jail explaining whats goin on in the hood, you know keeping him up to date. Anyway Every song is a classic, its that type of cd you can just put in and listen to without changing or skipping tracks. This is a must have for every Hip-Hop fan around the world.
B00005RHGK|1.0|Before watching the film, I heard a lot of people saying that it was a scary film and this made me want to watch it.  But when it ended, I felt like I lost a part of my life watching the movie.  It had to be the worst movie I had ever seen.  It wasn't scary and the plot was weak.  The parts that were supposed to be scary made me laugh.  I would never waste my time watching this one, let alone watch the next one(Jeepers Creepers II) just because it was even in the same series as the first one.
0385512104|5.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is a brilliant tour de force - one of the most original and moving books I have read in years.   The story and the way it is told are reminiscent of Faulkner's mentally challenged Benjy in \\"The Sound and the Fury\\" and the big city adventures of Salinger's teenaged protagonist, Holden Caulfield, in \\"Catcher in the Rye.\\"  Nevertheless, it is an original.<br />Christopher Boone is an autistic 15 year old who lives with his father and thinks that his mother is dead.  He is emotionally challenged but is so brilliant in \\"maths\\" that he is allowed to sit for the mathematics &quot;A Levels&quot; college entrance exams.  This is a book of endless invention, humor, and pathos.  It is not to be missed.
B0001906O0|5.0|Yes, I've given this collection five stars - and no, I haven't even got it yet. That's only because I am very, very broke at the moment - as in, settling down in front of the space heater to crunch on my Hamburger Helper without the hamburger. But I WILL be getting it, as soon as I can clench a few spare dollars and a sack of coins in my happy little hands. Oh yes, I will.<br />You see, I'm one of those fans - you know the type - with my wardrobe of faded black, RIT dye still ringing my fingernails, with a head full of lyrics to songs I've not even heard yet. This package is for folks like me. We've heard some of the songs, tracked down as many of the singles as our wallets permit (just for the extra bits unavailable on any album), scribbling down Want Lists on scraps of paper and dreaming of the day . . .<br />For every break-up that really meant something, the Cure was there. For every doomed love affair that we never got over, Robert provided the soundtrack. For every height we aspired to and every depth to which we sunk, our ears rang with these melodic truths. It was never enough to simply have DISINTEGRATION and WISH and KISS ME KISS ME KISS ME - no, there were so many other songs that cried out for inclusion on our bittersweet mix tapes. So many other sentiments that we'd hoped to share with our ill-fated love . . .<br />All those tracks from the orange mini-disc, I've never heard them.<br />Some of the b-sides that came before DISINTEGRATION, I've never been able to find.<br />To the Sky, I only caught the last half of it on radio late one night (and, when I called the next week to request it, the station had tragically lost it).<br />Some of the others from the later period, I've not even heard of them.<br />But now, they will be mine. Oh yes, all mine. I shall set aside an entire night, set aside my Hamburger Helper - and all of my present woes - and I will listen. I will fill up with the sounds and the words, and I will be transported, magically, into this other realm. The realm of the Cure.<br />And I will dream . . .s other realm. The realm of the Cure. <br />And I will dream . . .
B0000CD5FN|5.0|I was overwhelmed with how amazing this album was. Since the first Joe Strummer &amp; The Mescaleros album, Joe Strummer proved that he could still do it even at the age of 50. It's sad that he can't be around to make more music because he obviously still had alot left to give. His last album, this is one you don't want to miss.
B0000041Z6|2.0|For a few bucks more you can do a lot better than these (for the most part) mediocre performances. Although exciting in the loud parts, Solti doesn't really nail the feel or subtleties of this music, sounding flat and obtuse. I often have the impression that he just doesn't \\"get it\\". The 8th is the only very good one.<br />If you want to hear what this music is really supposed to sound like without spending to much, get Bernstein's 1+5 set on DG, the Mehta/Vienna 2nd (my favorite regardless of cost), Lopez-Cobos' 3rd, Szell's 4th and 6th, Bernstein's 7th on Sony, Solti's 8th (not ideal, but still very good and much cheaper than most), The Haitink/Concertgebouw 9th (the best!) WITH Das Leid von der Erde which isn't even on this Solti set. There are some better, more expensive choices, but those considering the Solti set are probably looking to save money. <br />There's really no good reason to buy this unless you truly can't spend another $20 or so. If you must (but please don't) buy a box set, try Inbal or Kubelik. I'd go with The Inbal set, which is exceptionally well recorded, too.
B0000026DJ|5.0|This particular work--of art--by &quot;Midnight Oil&quot;, is truly a masterpiece. . .and the fact that I am an avid and devout fan of this group, doesn't spin their music out into the netherworld, nor does it negate the truth that &quot;Midnight Oil&quot; is absolutely the best{especially to come out from &quot;The Land Down Under&quot;}!!!  As one reviewer has already stated,: &quot;Many bands and artists have made some sort of political or social concern apparent in their work, but few have done so as consistently, dedicatedly, and tunefully as Midnight Oil&quot;.   I am however, saddened by the departure of PETER GARRETT from the group. . .he will be sorely/greatly missed.  I am by the same token though, very glad for PETER--for I know that this is what he wants most; to be at the forefront of conservation in the landscape of Australias' natural scenic wonders.  And with his impressive 7-foot tall stature, I'm quite certain he won't have too much trouble presenting his well-founded statistics! Anyone not having heard this or any other of M.OILS' masterpieces-should definitely lend an ear!!!
B00005JLYW|4.0|It happened with 'The Avengers', to an extent it happened with 'Batman Returns', and now it's happening with 'Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle'. Critics and audiences alike lambasting a perfectly entertaining movie becuase of it's OTT-ness and refusal to adhere to the principles lain down in the original media.<br />Except what audiences and critics seem unable to remember is that for a modern remake of a classic comic/pulp TV show you can't just adhere to the situations and plotlines of the original becuase they would look silly and outdated. What the above mentioned movies have done, to one degree of success or another, is take a well-loved premise and updated it witha hefty dose of fun and irony, and thankfully, 'Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle' is one of the more successful ventures.<br />Reprising their roles as Dylan, Alex and Natalie, Drew barrymore, Lucy Liu and Cameron Diaz look like they're having the on-screen time of their lives, as they follow a perfunctory plot about FBI Information and an ngel-turned-Bad, Madison Lee (Demi Moore in a fne return to top form). Helped by an all-new Bosley (Bernie Mac in an entertaining, if hugely predictable turn) and some wildly unbelievable stunt-work, the Angels punch, kick and simper their way across all 107 minutes of this picture.<br />The chemistry between the three leads is as unmistakable as it is central to the success of the movie. Moore as Lee is suitably devilish as the sexually ambiguous powermonger, and other supporting cast nods go to Mac, Crispin glover as the ridiculously OTT Thin Man and a wonderful cameo from the still-gorgeous jaclyn Smith as Kelley Garrett (from the original TV run, but we can't help but wonder how fabulous she would have been in Moore's role).<br />Directorially this movie doesn't do anything big or clever - as with all matrix-effects-clones, the action comes thick and fast - but it's enjoyable, just the same. McG does a very good job at keeping us sucked in and laughing.<br />All in all, this is a total no-brainer of an action flick. It doesn't ask you to think, rather sits you down and does all the work by itself. It's a shallow, glamorous and totally fun roll in the hay with three fabulous femmes fatale. Fans of story-driven action may want to go elsewhere, but leave your brain at reception and you'll love it just as much as the original movie.<br />Recommended.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie offers answers to any person in search of the secrets of life. The book stresses how one can be educated about life by others, especially elders, in addition to our own experiences. Furthermore, if one is positive then one will be able to see the learning opportunities behind ones difficult moments. Consequently, bad events change from only being about suffering to being about valuable life lessons. Mitch Alboms novel is an example of how to face life with courage and how to learn about life from ones hard times.<BR>The novel is a true account of a student and his professors conversations about life. Not long after Mitchs college graduation, he was inspired to throw himself deeply into his career. Gradually, Mitch lost contact with his mentor and professor, Morrie Schwartz, with whom he had a tight relationship. Through a coincidence, Mitch became reunited with his college professor and from that point, they agreed to meet on Tuesdays to discuss life. The novel describes their time together as they talk about life and its secrets.<BR>  Tuesdays with Morrie, might be considered a self-help book, but it is not. The novel is quite different from other books that cover lifes issues since its format is simple, direct and it does not make one feel as if they are being preached to. In addition, the books topics are easy to relate to since they are practical and universal. Morries character is very inspiring since he has an optimistic and courageous attitude towards life, in spite of his obstacles. I learned a lot from Morries experiences, which have made me think about the meaning of life more. <BR>  The main theme of the book is to love, forgive and live positively. Unlike most people, Morrie chose to look beyond his obstacles, have a positive attitude and express his love for his family and friends. Consequently, he was able to live happily and created an example for every reader to follow. The book is an emotional journey that I strongly recommend everyone to take.
B00005JMTN|5.0|I think that those who are disappointed in &quot;Big Fish&quot; need to keep one thing in mind.  Tim Burton directed this film, but it is based on the novel by Daniel Wallace.  Those who are disappointed by this film probably feel so because the ending does not reach the lyrical height of &quot;Edward Scissorshand&quot; and the powerful idea of why it snows sometime in that suburban town.  I was actually thinking along those lines, wondering what wonder Burton would pull out of his hat this time, when it dawned on that this was not that sort of a movie.<br />&quot;Big Fish&quot; twists time between the present, in which old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) is dying, and the mythical past, in which the young Ed Bloom (Ewen McGregor) has the adventures that he is always telling everybody about.  Ed has been telling stories all of his life, to the complete enjoyment and captivation of everybody who hears them, except for his son, Will (Billy Crudup).  After a flare up at his wedding, where he thinks the day should finally be about him rather than his father, Will goes off to Paris with his wife to work as a wire service reporter and stops talking with his father.  But then the old man's health takes a final turn for the worse, William comes home and finally demands that his father finally tell him something about his life that is real before he dies.  Ed is not worried because when he was young he looked into the glass eye of a witch (Helena Bonham-Carter) and he knows how he dies and this is not it...yet.<br />What I picked up early in this movie is that Will is wrong.  Ed is not a blowhard.  Forget what Billy says and listen to him tell a story.  Look at the faces of his wife, Sandra (Jessica Lange), his daughter-in-law Josephine (Marion Cotillard), and the people in the audience when Ed tells his story.  Even when they let Ed know that they already know the story, such as the one about the car and the maple tree, these women have such love for Ed on their faces.  Only Will misses the point, and apparently he takes some of the audience members with him.  But when Burton gives cinematic vision to Ed's stories we can see the magic as well as hear it.<br />So we get to see the stories about Ed meeting Karl the Giant (Matthew McGrory), the circus run by Amos Calloway (Danny DeVito), his meeting Ping (Ada Tai) and Jin (Arlene Tai) during the war, and his wooing of the beautiful young Sandra (a postively glowing Alison Lohman).  Because this is Tim Burton these sequences are as fantastical as you would expect.  However, ironically, there is a moment in &quot;Big Fish&quot; where Burton goes too far and gives Will a brief glimpse of the fantasy world of which his father spins his tales.  However, that moment is a mistake, because it sets up the idea the film's final payoff might be along those lines and is at odds with both the conclusion and the overall film.<br />The trap in this film is quite clear to me now.  Audience members think they are supposed to identify with Will rather than Old Ed.  The truth is that we are supposed to identify with young Ed.  How can we not?  It is young Ed who hits the long homerun, who wins the girl, and who saves the town of Spectre.  But do not feel sorry for old Ed, because his wife is perfectly willing to climb into the bathtub with him, even when they are both dressed.  Will is the one that his been missing the magic and who realizes an ephihany when he proves himself to be his father's son.l misses the point, and apparently he takes some of the audience members with him.

0780628551|1.0|Not even Johnny Depp could save this mess. The Astronaut's Wife is a boring,pointless film that works better than sleeping pills. I kept asking myself, &quot;Why make this film??&quot;. <br />The Astronaut's Wife is basically a re-make of an old 1950's cheap Sci-Fi film, minus the unintentionally funny dialog. Its not scary and nothing really happens in the film until the very end, when the &quot;terrible secret&quot; is revealed.<br />Do yourself a favor, pretend that you never heard of this movie.
B0000897C2|4.0|When we talk about the history of the \\"movies\\" it is \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" (\\"Das Kabinett des Doktor Caligari\\") that has almost always represented the first prime example of the \\"cinema,\\" where we treat films as art. This is the best example of German Expressionism with angular sets and exaggerated performances by the actors that represented the dementia of the title character. Werner Krauss is the mad doctor, who uses his somnambulist Ceasar (Conrad Veidt) from his carnival sideshow to do his evil deeds, with Lil Dagover is the damsel in distress.  The film is framed by a rather clever plot device that turns the narrative upside down in the end, as a young man (Friedrich Feher) tells the story of Dr. Caligari's visit to the small German town of Holstenwall to an older one, as they sit together on a park bench.  There is also a strong sense of how the film serves as a metaphor for the destruction of post-war Germany.<br />Whatever the films shortcomings, the classic status of this 1919 film directed by Robert Wiene is assured by the striking art direction. The abstract, expressionists designs provide severely angled corners, crooked lines, and objects highlighted by decorative stripes.  If \\"Then Battleship Potemkin\\" opens us up as students of cinema to the possibilities about montage, then \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" does the same for mise-en-scene.  The film also establishes many of the conventions of the horror film (e.g., the mad scientist, beauty and the beast), although, surprisingly enough, the basic storyline has never been remade.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I often write about heart and soul when reviewing cds, describing the enormous effort musicians put into their works. Certainly there are many bands and singers who have devoted their lives to music, but never, ever have I heard an album that is remotely close to the breathtaking Pet Sounds, as far as work ethic, creativity, perseverence, and in the end, pure perfection. <br />Many people liken Pet Sounds to The Beatles Sgt. Pepper album. People often criticize Sgt. Pepper for taking its influence from the primordial Pet Sounds, but the fact that Brian Wilson was first inspired to make Pet Sounds after he heard Rubber Soul is often overlooked. Here's what he said in the liner notes: &quot;In December of 1965, I heard the album Rubber Soul by the Beatles. It was definitely a challenge for me. I saw that every cut was very artistically interesting and stimulating. I immediately went to work on the songs for Pet Sounds.&quot; As a huge fan of both the Beatles and the Beach Boys, I find it absolutely wonderful and riveting that the two biggest bands from across the seas were involved in somewhat of an artistic spar; one which ended up helping both bands produce some of their greatest music.<br />As far as the individual songs of this album, there are no highs and lows. Pet Sounds stays at a steady constant of brilliance, sounding at an uncalibrated musical high. From the swirling harmonies of the opening Wouldn't It Be Nice to the wonderful coda of Hang On To Your Ego, this recording is thoroughly enjoyable. My personal favorites are Wouldn't It Be Nice, God Only Knows and I Just Wasn't Made For These Times. To wrap things up with a hackneyed yet appropiate cliche, your music collection is incomplete without Pet Sounds.
0793518326|5.0|First off the Beatles have been the most influincing band that i have ever come across.  The music is fab.  John has a great voice, george plays guitar so well and paul and ringo ice the cake.  I have been playing guitar for some time now and have always been interested in recreating that wonder tone the beatles gave 40 years ago.  This book is the closet i have seen so far to being accurate.  Although there are some mistakes you can figure them out by watching the Beatles Anthology and seeing them actually play the music or even listen and fix it.

HAL LEONARD CORPORATION YOU GUYS SHOULD FIX UP THIS BOOK AND RE-PUBLISH IT TO MAKE IT MORE ACCURATE ALSO ADD &quot;FREE AS A BIRD&quot; AND &quot;REAL LOVE&quot;
B00004ZD69|5.0|if you purchase one album in this lifetime, this is it.  while godspeeds prior releases as well as their latest album are worthy of ownership, &quot;lift yr skinny fists...&quot; is quintessential of what the group has tried to achieve.  when listened in its entirety, the two discs that form this album provide an enhanced listening experience similar to that of the hammer of god pounding on your chest.  if you are a fan of godspeed and do not own this, then you have failed to see the light and need to immediately make this album part of your world.  as in past albums, godspeed combines orchestral soundscapes with climatic musical flourishes and samples, such as the eerie musings of a christian mystic or the lamenatations of a man who remembered when they used to sleep on the beach at coney island...&quot;it was a playground, they called it the playground of the world...&quot;.  beautiful, elegant, disheartening, and yet quietly hopeful, this &quot;lift yr skinny fists...&quot; embodies all those things we wish for when morning brings grey skies and cold winds, and we try to see the beauty in this land but sometimes have a hard time doing so...

6301763041|5.0|This movie is so amazing! I watched it for the first time just cause Iggy was in it, but it was waaay better than I expected. Johnny Depp is incredibly gorgeous in this movie, with his hair, leather jacket.....This movie is not at all serious, so don't go in with that mindset or you'll hate it. It's campy, I mean its a musical for god's sake!!! The songs are really stupid and get stuck in your head weeks after you've seen the movie...but that's actually a good thing. This movie is not just for obsessed Johnny Depp freaks it is just generally a funny lovable movie. Oh and the Igster is hilarious as Uncle Belevedere he fits the part completely.
B00004YA66|4.0|I had never heard of this movie until my boyfriend rented it at the library. I was very happily surprised with it.<br />A 36 year old man by pure luck gets to enter in contact with his dead father of 30 years before. He relives every day with his father of 30 years before by using his old fireman radio. By doing so, he prevents him from dying in a fire which leads to radical changes in both their lives: like the murder of his mother. Being a cop, he sets out to try and prevent the killings of the past with the help of his father. This leads to a hunt for the killer in both 1999 and 1969.<br />I enjoyed the originality of the story, and the suspense that built up as the story developped. There are numerous unexpected twists that lead to a thrilling ending.<br />I highly recommend this movie, it definitly should become a classic thriller.
B00005JMGL|5.0|i went cause ithought jeremy sumpter was very kute and i thought i might like it but i LOVED it i was caught into the story from the very beginning and i was amazed by the teens acting ability. being the same age as jeremy i know i could never show as much emotion as him and i think they all did an amazing job. i laughed, cried, and i had the biggest smile on my face cause it just an awsome movie. i guarnntee u will love this movie. go see it asap.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I can't understand what all the fuss was about this movie.  Outside of a few comedic scenes, nothing happened.  Bill Murray is fine as a has been actor in Tokyo filming a whiskey commercial and with gaggles of time on his hands.  Scarlett Johansson is accompanying her photographer husband, the talented Giovanni Ribisi who is also working in Tokyo.  She is trying to find her niche in life and is bored with the culture shock that Japan represents.  Johansson and Murray strike up a friendship and become companions sojourning through the city.  They eventually develope fond yet platonic feelings for each other.<br />Sofia Coppolla is getting undeserved accolades for this film, which I fortunately preceded with a large cup of coffee.
B000068TP0|5.0|An innovative performer in the Latin pop music market, this is Shakira well before she showed up on any babe magazine's &quot;100 Most [whatever]&quot; list.  Leave it to MTV to provide the best sound, best camera work, and best overall production value for this excellent concert.  Whether or not you're familiar with Shakira's songs, I believe you'll be happy you watched this edition of &quot;Unplugged.&quot;<br />Eleven songs were recorded for this show, which took place in August of 1999, ten of which came from her then latest album, &quot;Donde Estan Los Ladrones?&quot;  Characteristic of a first-rate live performance, many of the songs had a different arrangement and/or changed instrumentation, with the result being a totally fresh feel to the numbers.  Shakira's changing vocal texture and phrasing is what sets her apart from every other singer, and what injects the passion into her songs.  Even though I don't understand much Spanish (I have yet to avail myself of the subtitle option), I can't help but pay close attention while she's singing.  That's how cool her voice is.<br />The concert has some great surprises, a few of which were the accompaniment by mariachi band Los Mora Arriaga in &quot;Ciega, Sordomuda&quot;; the rearranged version of &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; (the only song from the &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; album); and the middle eastern influenced music and dance in &quot;Ojos Asi&quot; (not to be missed).  There's so much that meets the eye during this performance.<br />DVD extras:  you'll find the oft-included bio, discography, and photos, but the highlight by far is the half-hour &quot;Behind the Camera&quot; feature, which has interviews with Shakira, her collaborators and producers.  Very well done.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is definitely Britney Spears' most artistic and heartfelt CD produced, and it deserves every star possible.  Every song is this album gets an A or A+ (after taking a 2-year break, she comes back full-force). My only complaint is that it's way too short; we blow through the CD in less than an hour!  Anywho, here's the deal:<BR>THE PERFRECT 10's:  <BR>\\"Showdown\\" (track 3) has a cool techno beat and the song shows off some of her range. She really gets into the song with her Rocker Chick cries and it really kicks it up a notch!<BR>\\"Breathe On Me\\" (track 4) is EXTREMELY sensual and it's the perfect pole-dancing number. I don't care who you are, the hypnotic, catchy lyrics and the thumping beat will have you hooked.<BR>\\"Toxic\\" (track 6) was awesome even before she released that kick-ass video of hers. By the way, a message for my haters: \\"She's not wearing 'boobie-tassels,' it's a flesh-toned catsuit. It reminds of a James Bond girl, and that's cool to me. Yeah.\\" This song grabs you from the start with the very strange, off-kilter horror movie-esque introduction. The song always gets me up on my feet when the guitar ushers in the chorus.<BR>\\"Touch of My Hand\\" (track 8) is a catchy song about an... interesting subject. This probably wouldn't be a good song to play at the Church-sponsored dance off or anything, but I found myself singing along nonetheless. I thought it was going to be terribly explicit with this subject, but it actually makes a good statement and doesn't condemn self-love... or shove it in anyone's face.<BR>\\"The Hook Up\\" (track 9) sounds a bit like Beyonce's \\"Baby Boy.\\" I was pleasantly surprised at how Britney pulled off reggae effortlessly. I have no idea who the Reggae Master in the song was, but I liked his part in the song too.<BR>\\"Shadow\\" (track 10) is a GREAT ballad with a twist and I'm glad she put this song on the album. I have a feeling this one could be about Justin (the chipmunk) and it isn't spiteful or nasty. Lots of people can relate tothe lyrics since they refer to love spurned and I'm a big fan of that feeling. You have to sing along and let the pain out: \\"Your body's warm but you... are not, you give a little, not a... lot\\" Good song.<BR>\\"Brave New Girl\\" (track 11) is the pop tune that Brit threw in so she wouldn't totally alienate the young fans. I can't believe it! Britney raps on this track and it works! I didn't burst out laughing or anything! Really. This song is cool even though the background is a bit too \\"gay disco\\" for the album as a whole. Awesome song and perfect ending.<BR>\\"Everytime\\" (track 12) is, by far, the best ballad I've heard in a while. Britney's voice is made for ballads because it's so sad and so heartfelt. It's a touching song and it makes you relive some bad memories too. Woo hoo for bad memories! Just kidding, it's a beautiful song.<BR>\\"Me Against the Music (The Remix!)\\" (track 13) is better than the original because MTV played the crap out of the Me Against the Music video. This is a great remix because it adds in an 80s Boogaloo feel as well as some techno beats. It also sounds more like a Britney song.<br />THE 9.5's<BR>\\"Me Against the Music\\" (track 1) was an awesome 1st single, but I'd heard it about 5 MONTHS before the CD was released. Plus, MTV and the radio stations really embraced the heck out of it. So... it got a little annoying after a while. Also, Madonna kind of overpowers Britney in this song; otherwise, it's still a good dance song.   <BR>\\"Boom Boom (I Got That)\\" (track 2) is just so surprising and exciting. Britney recruited the Yin Yang Twins (rappers we actually have heard of!) for this song and throws in a cool banjo riff... didn't think I'd ever say \\"cool\\" and \\"banjo\\" in the same sentence. Go figure. Perfect Club Song.<BR>\\"Early Mornin'\\" (track 5) is pretty good but is a bit too \\"Thugged-out Britney\\" and doesn't sound like her style. Besides that, it still has has a catchy chorus and is a song to chill out with.<BR>\\"Outrageous\\" (track 7) is absolutely hilarious too me because it's Gangsta Britney or as she says \\"B-Girl.\\" It just makes me wanna shake my paper cup of champagne in the air whenever she sings \\"We on a world tour... Outrageous!\\" And it features R. Kelly, which gives it some flava'. Very cool song. Gets old kinda quickly.<br />Overall, this was one of my BEST buys last year. I even had to buy another copy because I wore the first one out so every song skipped a million times. By the way, if you're someone who appreciates Brit's beats, stay far away from Justin Timberlake's \\"Justified\\" or Xtina's \\"Stripped.\\" Not because I don't like them personally, but because both of their voices are annoying to me; hers is too breathy and obnoxious (most unsatisfying) and the videos absolutely ruin every single (EEK!), his goes where no man's voice should EVER go. Brit's mellow and gets me going. Buy the album and let yourself go wild! Thanks for listening... all three of you.
B0001906O0|5.0|Robert Smith (and all the Cures - past and present - with whom he has collaborated) offers a gem of a collection with this release.  <br />Unless you were lucky enough to find some of these songs on the cassette version of the &quot;Standing On A Beach&quot; collection or on import vinyl 12&quot; singles, many will be brand new to you. But whether you have heard bits and pieces or not, this collection is truly amazing in its scope and sound quality.  Hearing the early songs &quot;cleaned up&quot; for compact disc makes this set well worth the price of admission.<br />Also, some Cure fans will no doubt remember a handful of these songs as the &quot;in-between bits&quot; from the VHS &quot;Staring at the Sea -The Images&quot; (especially &quot;Throw Your Foot&quot; which showed Robert walking around in what appeared to be a drug-induced state) and having them all in one place really is a treat.  <br />Standout tracks are &quot;I'm Cold&quot;, &quot;Throw Your Foot&quot;, and &quot;2 Late.&quot;  Disc four gets a bit indulgent:  the Depeche Mode re-make is interesting and signifies well on the original, but it's a bit severe.  I do not, however, feel that this detracts from the set as a whole.  After all, isn't The Cure rather severe?  <br />All in all, there is plenty by which to be impressed.  This will be a welcome addition to any Cure fan's collection (and even to collections of neophyte Cure fans).  <br />Definitely worth buying.  No doubt.  Order it today.
B000089RVX|3.0|I liked this cd when it debuted but after awhile I noticed the repetitive lyrics and melodies. She says &quot;Screaming Deceiving and Bleeding for you&quot; in Going under. In Tourniquiet she says &quot;Im dying, praying, bleeding and screaming&quot;. It's okay for a spin every now and then but not for excessive listens.
B00005JLR6|5.0|There are films that are so humane, and make us love their characters so deeply, that they make us better people (at least temporarily) just for watching them. \\"In America,\\" Jim Sheridan's semiautobiographical movie about about an Irish family in Manhattan in the early 1980s, is one of those films. The Sullivans--father Johnny, mother Sarah, small daughters Christie and Ariel--are still shell-shocked from the death of the family's young son from a brain tumor. They live in poverty in a Lower East Side tenement--the father, an actor, endures a futile daily grind of auditions while driving a cab to make ends meet. Told mostly from Christie's standpoint, \\"In America\\" is the story of how the Sullivans fare in their exciting but threatening new home, and of the friends they make--particularly Mateo, the artist dying of AIDS who lives on the floor below. Making Christie the narrator was a master stroke, for the film's touches of magic realism are all the more believable for being a child's perceptions. (One unforgettable scene makes a baseball-toss game at a street fair the subject of unbearable suspense.) \\"In America\\" never puts a foot wrong, in its direction, writing or acting; all the performances, unfussy and emotionally direct, seem to be lived rather than acted. The adult actors--Paddy Considine as Johnny, Samantha Morton as Sarah, and Djimon Hounsou as Mateo--give astonishingly strong, moving performances. The children--real-life sisters Sarah and Emma Bolger as Christie and Ariel--are as enchanting as any child actors who have ever stood in front of a camera. \\"In America\\" isn't for the \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" crowd--the emotions and situations it depicts are messy, and the only sugar in the script is in the ice-cream sundaes Christie and Ariel eat. But love and forgiveness are in abundance here, as are faith, hope and charity. \\"In America\\" bears comparison with Elia Kazan's \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,\\" another, much older movie about an Irish family in a New York tenement. Both have the same level of unsentimental poignancy and meticulous craft.York tenement. Both have the same level of unsentimental poignancy and meticulous craft.
B000001ESN|5.0|\\"Permanent Waves\\" brought Rush's first big commercial success, \\"The spirit of radio\\", but I don't think the band was moving into a commercial way of life. In \\"Permanent Waves\\", from 1980, we can see a very mature band, playing very complex hard/progressive rock'n roll with a clean and well produced sound. After the excellent transitional albums \\"A Farewell to Kings\\" and \\"Hemispheres\\"\\", both incredible strong and very rich recordings, the band evolved in lyrics and sound production. In \\"Permanent Waves\\" their songs are much more tight, compact and melodical. The rhythm section is good as in the previous albums, but this time they're doing very riff-dominated progressive hard rock trough shorter compositions. The moog synth and other keyboards are present, and they fit perfectly! Peart's lyrics are notably good and Geddy's vocals are, finally, convicent! \\"Permanent Waves\\" has the typical Rush 70's sound with some elements of the 80's. \\"The spirit of radio\\" is a superb track, with so many good rhythm variations and riffs that really makes me shout ! \\"Freewill\\" is a great, great and decent Rush track ! I dont believe some people don't like this one! Why ? WHY ? There is a jam in the middle that you must listen to ! Pure Lee-Lifeson-Peart energy ! \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" has an introspective mood, good lyrics and an excellent big and compact instrumental part. Excellent. \\"Entre Nous\\" is a short Rush rock song, not as heavy as in the first albums, neither intense as in \\"Farewell...\\" or \\"Hemispheres\\". Just very good. \\"Different Strings\\" is a dreamy ballad, beautiful lyrics, some clean acoustic guitars and a great final part with a fat bass and an emotive guitar solo. The album finishes with \\"Natural Science\\". A typical rush progressive song. Some \\"profetic\\" lyrics acompannied by acoustic guitars and some...water in the intro. Then came a VERY GOOD riff with some synth, some Peart's goodies and the rest of the guys really kicking off ! There's a beautiful Lifeson's guitar solo andmany other things that maybe makes this track the best in the album. \\"Permanet Waves\\" shows a band that are growing and making a lot of fans around the world with some excellent albums. This is the last Rush 70's sounding album,then the band moved into the 80's with synthesizers and many other influences that this decade brought to popular music. The next two albums are a perfect combination of this elements, classics, but in a few years we would see what was the 80's...
B0000B1OFL|2.0|I know i have seen films with *more* product placement than this -- the average Bond film, these days, has more overall -- but i don't think i ever saw a single *bigger* piece of product placement.<br />I mean, would this film have even been made if BMW hadn't felt a need to promote their new &quot;Mini Cooper&quot;?<br />That said, i have to admit that this is not the sort of steaming pile of cowchips that the 2000 &quot;remake&quot; of &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; was -- they have wisely not tried to do an &quot;improved&quot; version of the original, but have actually done what might have been a sequel (one was sort-of planned), if it had begun with Charlie and Co. getting out of the cliffhanger that ended the original film, followed by a double-cross by a gang member.<br />It has neither the charm nor the Britishness of the original, and it sorely misses Michael Caine and Noel Coward (though i'm just as glad Seth Green's character didn't recycle the Benny Hill computer expert character from the first film...), nor is the chase so inventive or so sustained (though it does have several direct references to the original film's chase) but it's okay if you take it on its own terms as a light action film, useful for killing part of an afternoon if you don't think too hard.<br />Since the original is also available on DVD -- i believe there's a reasonably-priced two-fer available on Amazon -- one might amuse oneself by seeing if one can manage to siot through both back-to-back, and decide which is the better.  My personal choice would be the original, but there are more than a few decent moments in the remake.<br />The Bottom Line: Not bad, but unnecessary.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|The original recording produced by Phil Spector is a classic.<BR>Although I enjoyed listening to the stripped down versions of <BR>\\"The Long And Winding Road\\" \\"Across The Universe\\" and<BR>\\"Let It Be\\" most of Naked seems rather lifeless.

B00005YW4H|4.0|After seeing Norah Jones on David Letterman after this CD came out, I was hooked!  She was/is terrific, unique.  I immediately bought this CD and after listening to it was very disappointed--my first impression was that every song seemed to sound the same.  I kept listengin to it and discovered that while Norah's voice seems to maintain the same melodic quality, the words and music started to change for me.  I love this CD--it's calms the nerves during rush our traffic!
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is the first radiohead album i had gotten, and after my first listen, they quickly shot up to among my favorite bands.  Thom Yorke's ghastly voice shines through the whole album wonderfully.  The songs are deep and meaningful lyrically, and musically they are intricately crafted while still accessible.  You couldn't ask for a better opener than Airbag, which is a wonderful &quot;rock overture&quot; if you will and starts the album out nicely.  The album then takes you to Paraonoid Android, three great songs combined beautifully into one masterpiece.  There are also many other songs that stand out for me on the album.  Exit Music is a beautiful but depressed sounding ballad.  You'll definetly get chills when you hear the words &quot;We hope that you choke.&quot;  Fitter Happier is told by a robot, and although it may sound fairly optimistic lyrically, it contrasts itself and makes you think with a sad sounding background.  Karma Police is also an outstanding song, and it goes perfectly with Thom's voice.  Electioneering is reminiscent of the style of the great guitarist Jimi Hendrix, and is an energetic song all the way through.  Climbing Up The Walls, about thieves, is another darkly wonderful tune.  To top it all off, we have The Tourist, a true closing that keeps you satisfied all the way to the closing &quot;ding&quot;.  This is definetly a great cd, and if you havent checked it out yet, you best do so.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|For all of you who thinks that this DVD version is the best you are wrong.  I saw this movie in a theather in 1982 and what a joy to see this movie on a big silver screen.  If I compare the DVD to the Theatre version well I am very generous about this 1 star because I couldn't put less.  This version is only a massacre of a beautiful movie that demands a wide-screen version to really appreciate the scale of the cinematography of that movie &quot;let go to the movie&quot; is an example.  I am not going to by this DVD Edition and I suggest strongly to anyone who wants to enjoy the movie as it was ment to be to claim from Columbia Tristar Home Video a Wide-Screen treatment and DO NOT BY this version let that company drown in their ocean of not sold Annie (Special Anniversary Edition) DVD full-Screen.  Although this DVD claims to have a DTS soundtrack wich is good I suggest also to those of you who have a wide-screen release to hold on to this copy and don't waste your money and by the way I read some review and one of them said that the full screen version was giving a complete picture false all the way that movie was filmed in a 35mm anamorphic format in other world Panavision with a aspect ration of 2.35:1 and a TV set is 1.33:1 so filling a TV set screen give you to lose 43% of the picture. I hope strongly that you big shots at Columbia Tristar Home Video (own by Sony Pictures) will release in the near future a Wide-Screen treatment on DVD of this wonderfull motion picture otherwise I will hold on to my Laserdisc (12 inches optical analogue video disc) Wide-Screen Version Of Annie.
B000002TQV|4.0|This album as a whole isn't Radiohead's best in my opinion, but when its good, its gooooood.  The album as a whole is more light hearted then their later albums.  The opening song, Planet Telex, is an amazing statement, and Yorke's sluggish (and drunk) voice contrasts nicely with the energy set up by the instrumentalists.  The title track is a catchy tune that never lets up and keeps you hooked throughout.  Beware of High and Dry, its amazingly catchy and will probably be in your head for days.  Thom does some nice vocal stuff in their.  Fake Plastic Trees is a beautifully emotional song that isnt dark sounding, something you don't see from radiohead very often.  However, the lyrics aren't very joyous either.  Thom obviously pours his whole heart and sould into singing this song.  The amazing songs of the album pretty much end there though.  NOT to say that the album doesn't sport some other very nice songs, such as Bones, Just, Street Spirit, Bulletproof, and Sulk.  However, these songs just don't click as much as the first four songs do.  But considering that the opening 4 are amazing, they really can't be compared to.  The album would still be worth buying even if they weren't on it, but it would be nowhere near as good (3 stars?).  But since they ARE there for your listening enjoyment, why not check it out?
B0000TAZBK|5.0|Personally,my favorite CD is the first one (maybe because I'm more used to it?)but acually they are all veeerrrYyyyy great and I suggest buying this.And u get 18 free pictures too.If any of you read spinner903's comment...he said this was overpriced.Wrong.He said that he could buy the CD's for less.Yes...he spoke true...but notice that THIS set is ENHANCED.If you bought the 3 CD's seperately and they were enhanced then it would cost 23$ each!And also this is limited edition...(if that means anything to you)...oh yea, and did I mention?Free pictures!Woohoo!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead manages to take the successful elements of the likes of The Bends and OK Computer and merge them with the fascinating yet inaccessible work on the Kid A/Amnesiac albums and the result? Hail to The Thief, one of the finest works of art ever to emerge in the music world.  This album gets you hooked right away with the opening song, 2+2=5, a moody lament-like tune that accumulates into a fairly frenzied state.  As the album progresses, the dark cloud set apon us by the opening song rarely lifts, following up with dark pieces like Sit Down. Stand Up., The Gloaming, and the death-march style We Suck Young Blood.<BR>This cd is also home to the hit singles, There There, a catchy mildly funky tune, and A Punch Up at a Wedding, a slowish rock.  Definetly a great cd, full of deep lyrics and intricate sounds.  By all means check it out!
B000002UJQ|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said.  Ok Computer is for lack of a better word... perfect.  It can't be topped... ever.  It's inspiring to hear this album and be able to apreciate that it's not simply music you are hearing... but a work of art.  It is not an album for everyone, simply for people who search and demand more from thier music.  I wrote this review to try to help get it up to five stars becouse... if there is an album that diserves it, it's OK Computer.  Check out my other reviews for other music that is not for everyone... but for those who look for a little extra.
B0000C1733|5.0|If there is a song on this cd you haven't heard, you really can't consider yourself a true Chili Peppers Fan.  Although missing some of their best work in my opinion, i.e. Aeroplane, Love Rollercoaster, Can't Stop etc. it also has a myriad of awesome stuff.  Californication? You bet. Give it Away? Yep. Under the Bridge? Its on there.  This cd also sports By the Way, My Friends, Breaking the Girl, Suck My Kiss, and Otherside, some of my other favorites.  If you dont like those songs (which should be a crime) then theres plenty more good stuff in here as well.  You'll never get tired of this cd.  Its one of those gems you can just pop in your cd player and listen to over and over again.  So definetly pick this one up.
B00000I07R|5.0|It's probably better than New Jersey. How can anything be better than New Jersey??? For YEARS I hadn't bought any Bon Jovi, afraid of them not living up to the New Jersey Standard I've set for them in the post-Grunge music universe (well, Van Halen sucked then, and the Crue sucked then, and also as young newlyweds in grad school in the early 90s we didn't have extra cash to spend on CDs) till my husband brings me home a copy of Crush in 2002 as a gift and I start all over being a fan (first heard JBJ in 1983 with &quot;Runaway&quot;, big 80s fan like everyone else my age). Bounce is great too, but This Left Feels Right I don't like so much, so I go to pick up the holes in my back catalog...starting with Keep the Faith. Wish I had bought it 12 years sooner. There isn't a bad song on here with the possible exception of the somewhat weak &quot;Woman in Love&quot;,  and &quot;Dry County&quot; and &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; are classics of, well, classic proprotions. Admit that you totally love Bon Jovi and go buy the CD already. You won't be sorry.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I will begin my review with an overview of the tracks:<BR>N/A Foreward- I think this should have been included at the beginning of Don't Stay, but good anyway<br />7/10 Don't Stay- Not one of the best songs on the CD, but still good.<br />9/10 Somewhere I Belong- One of my favorite songs on the CD<br />8/10 Lying From You- A good song, not the best on the CD but an awesome song<br />9/10 Hit The Floor- Awesome.<br />9/10 Easier To Run- Awesome.<br />10/10 Faint- The best song on the CD.  Very catchy, and almost never gets old<br />10/10 Figure.09- Awesome Lyrics<br />8/10 Breaking the Habit- Sounds a lot like pop, but still great lyrics<br />10/10 From The Inside- Sweet.<br />8/10 Nobody's Listening- Nice bass...OK beat and OK lyrics, kinda repetitive, my least favorite song on the CD, but still pretty good<br />10/10 Session- Not much to say about this..Except its cool<br />10/10 Numb- A sweet song, my second favorite on the CD<br />Overall I give this CD a 10/10...With awesome lyrics and awesome beats.  This CD is just as good or better than Hybrid Theory.  Buy this CD along with Hybrid Theory and Reanimation...Live In Texas too if you want.
B00005JME0|5.0|I actually saw this movie twice. It was done so well. I am a big fan of time movies and the past few that have come out recently(TimeLine and The Time Machine) have been disappointments. The Butterfly Effect is one of my favorite movies. Good job to all who worked on this film. To the critcs who bashed it....try not roughing up a film just because Ashton is in it. You people do not know how to enjoy a movie.
0786112328|4.0|The story is quite funny, I often laughed out loud. Some of the parts of the story and a few of the character were not realistic, and the ethnic stereotyping got old, but on the whole I enjoyed this. I listened to the audio version of this book - and the reader was perfect.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The third of Howard Shore's soundtrack albums to the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movie trilogy is, like the film itself, the best of the best. The albums for both \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" and \\"The Two Towers\\" were superb, stunning orchestral storyscapes that perfectly caught Tolkien's Middle-Earth and were wonderful individual listening experiences on their own, away from the films. The perfect music to read Tolkien by.<br />But this is the big one. This is the masterpiece. This is some of best film music of the last decade. Shore surpasses himself in every way on this score.<br />The new major theme for the score is the Gondor Theme, heard in fullest expression in the inspiring track \\"The White Tree\\" (actually, this is the music for the lighting of the beacons of Gondor) and also in \\"Minas Tirith\\" and the lonely, sad track \\"The Steward of Gondor,\\" where Billy Boyd provides a haunting song to accompany a massacre. (Boyd's voice is a real surprise -- he sounds professional).<br />The other themes from the early films return, with Shore adapting them and changing them in surprising ways. You'll thrill to hearing the Rohirrim theme in \\"The Ride of the Rohirrim\\" as well as the way the theme introduces the real stand-out track of the album, \\"The Fields of Pelennor,\\" a masterpiece suite describing various aspects of the battle around Minas Tirith. This track achieves almost a sublime level of action and power (screaming chorus, driving brass, and Shore's characteristic delayed resolution to build suspense) and is the musical highlight of the three albums. (I stood up cheered at the end the first time I heard it, even though I was alone.)<br />\\"Shelob's Lair\\" is also an amazing track, filled with jabbing, crazy strings and a sense of rising panic. You can hear the giant spider moving around in the music and it will make you as afraid as Frodo himself was.<br />Shore pounds the story into an orchestral rage for \\"The End of All Things,\\" which is the story's climax and an overwhelming track of rapidly shifting emotions and explosions of choral fury. It will quite wring you out the same way the movie does at this point.<br />For quieter moments, there are beautiful and inspiring tracks like \\"Twilight and Shadow\\" (dealing with Arwen) and the lengthy ten-minute track \\"The Return of the King,\\" which sums up all the major themes and at last brings us full circle to the sprightly Hobbiton theme first heard back in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\" Shore ends it all with grace and quiet beauty in the subtle and sad track \\"The Grey Havens,\\" which uses a theme that had grown throughout the score. This theme then becomes the soft and soulful Annie Lennox song, \\"Into the West,\\" the perfect conclusion to the album.<br />I've come across few soundtrack albums as well put together as this. Anyone who loves Tolkien, film music, or great orchestral music, MUST buy this album.<br />My only complaint? There's so much more music in the film than they could fit on a single CD. A big deluxe double CD with more of the music would be appreciated in the near future.
B0000CAQ27|3.0|Pink's new album is a propotition that can be consider a misstep or a great advance, although &quot;Try This&quot; has lost the commercial appeal of &quot;Missundertood&quot;, her aproach of a more intimate topics in this album is obvious.  Her team work with Tim Armstrong instead of her resurrected friend Linda Perry, make Try This lost that touch that her previous work offer.  The tracks of &quot;Try This&quot; showcases simply rock songs that could be easily labeled as a reminisce of the mid-80's rock, simple lyrics, simple rock...but there is something different Pink tries to put a lot of soul in it.  The Highlights here are Trouble(wich includes an amazing bridge line &quot;If you see me coming....), Save My Life, Tonight's The Night.  This album will not fullfil the radio airplay expectations, but will give fans an others a different taste from Alicia Moore.
B0000UHFC6|5.0|This deluxe edition of the soundtrack to &quot;The Return of the King&quot; has the exact same music as the regular edition, but comes in a beautiful leather package.

B0000508U6|3.0|This is a good debut, a fine (not too) alternative rock album, even if it was overrated when it came out. It shows that Coldplay, although a bit derivative (yep, Radiohead, Jeff Buckley or U2 come to mind) are still a strong band worth checking, one that knows how to deliver interesting, simple and well-constructed songs. It hardly brings anything new, but &quot;Parachutes&quot; works as a fine piece of mellow, bittersweet and captivating moments, particularly the melancholic &quot;Don`t Panic&quot; or the suspenseful &quot;Spies&quot;. The single &quot;Yellow&quot; is the most annoying and weak song here, while most of the others aren`t great but remain engaging and heartfelt enough to deserve multiple listens. So, Coldplay aren`t quite the saviours of rock but still offer a consistent record, one that`s a bit above most of the brit pop albums around (Oasis, Travis,...). Not great, just good. And appropriate to listen to at night.
B000002U9L|5.0|The movie was great! But what would a movie be without wonderful music!? I really loved &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. It's a magnificent movie that is well-cast with beautiful music. I would recommend this album to anyone who has an imagination and a taste for exciting, dreamy music. David Bowie's songs are incredible as is Trevor Jones score! I have always been a big fan of the romantic song &quot;As The World Falls Down&quot;...I would say that that is the best song on the album. &quot;Magic Dance&quot; is fun and charming. &quot;Within You&quot; is mysterious and passionate! I particularly love &quot;Sarah&quot; from Trevor Jones. If you loved the movie you'll love the music! Don't hesitate to buy this album, it's worth every penny! Keep on dreaming!
B0001AP12G|5.0|KanYe West has not only proven to be one of the best producers of the 03-04 But now with &amp;quot;College Dropout&amp;quot; he is one of the best rappers, he brings Hip-Hop back to soul records.
0060392886|4.0|Twenty years of Motley cure told from the band member's point of view. starting with their club days in LA, when they all lived in the same dirty apartment to their late nineties reunion, the Dirt provides and in depth look into of of Rock's most controversial bands. Sometimes you get 2 three different POV's into the same story. For example; Vince Neil's infamous car wreck which killed Hanoi Rocks drummer Nicolas Razzle is told from the POV's of all for members; where they were. how they remember it. Anyone who's who loves reading Rock n' Roll Biographies, even if you're not a Crue fan would enjoy \\"the Dirt.\\" You won't like because of the book, in fact, you might grow hare them more, but, not without feeling some empathy. The human element is there, and the book itself is an entertaining read.
B000088E6D|5.0|Listen to the ease in which Buble sings the variety of songs he does on this cd and you will discover why he has fast become a worldwide hit.<BR>His pitch is perfect, his delivery impeccable and his style about as smooth as butter. Now this is a anomaly in today's world of synthetic music and often foul lyrics. Buble sings with a passion, beautiful words and a respect for how words and music can be used to elevate our spirits. Try listening to Thats All and not feeling moved. When I heard Barry Gibb lending backgrounds to Broken Heart, it broke my heart! What a beautiful collaboration. Moving!!! Fantastic!!!<BR>I can't say I'm a Queen fan, but found Crazy Little to be light and clean.<BR>If you appreciate star quality and are looking for that special something for someone special or just a treat for yourself, this is the cd that will be treasured. Superb all around.

B000006SGT|5.0|The Animals, a group that included Eric Burdon and Alan Price, were the first major pop stars to emerge from Newcastle, a city located about 300 miles north of London, therefore far removed from where most talent scouts were searching. It is fortunate for us all that the Animals were discovered because they recorded some of the best R+B music to come of the UK in the sixties.<br /><br />Their biggest hit was House of the rising sun, a re-working of a folk song (apparently inspired by Josh White's version of the song) that gave them a transatlantic number one hit. They had five other top ten UK hits with Mickie Most, these being I'm crying, Don't let me be misunderstood (a cover of a Nina Simone song), Bring it on home to me (a Sam Cooke cover), We gotta get out of this place (the version included here is the UK version - a markedly different recording was released in America but was unavailable for inclusion in this set) and It's my life.<br /><br />Apart from their singles, the Animals recorded many other covers including Boom boom, Dimples, I'm mad again (all John Lee Hooker), Around and around, Memphis Tennessee, How you've changed (all Chuck Berry), I'm in love again, I've been around (both Fats Domino), Talking about you, Hallelujah I love her so and I believe to my soul (all Ray Charles). These covers clearly demonstrate what their main influences were, but they also wrote some of their own songs.<br /><br />All the music I've mentioned so far and much more can be found on this excellent compilation. Nevertheless, despite the title of the compilation, it isn't actually their complete recordings - there is a sub-text explaining that these are the complete recordings that they made with Mickie Most as producer, although the liner notes describe their whole career. After the split, they switched to another record label, where they had some success using the name Eric Burdon and the Animals, including two more UK top ten hits (Don't bring me down, San Franciscan nights) and several lesser hits, all of which can be found elsewhere (search for Eric Burdon). Alan Price left the group before the split with Mickie Most and had several hits as a solo singer. These are also outside the scope of this collection but are easy to find.<br /><br />This complete collection (apart from the American version of We've got to get out of this place) of the first and most important part of the Animals' career may be more than some people want - there are single CD collections available if you just want the hits - but if, like me, you like to explore beyond the hits, this is for you.er hits, all of which can be found elsewhere (search for Eric Burdon).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Great show.  Very sad to hear it was cancelled.  I love the humor, excitment and characters.  The characters are more real than the squeeky clean characters on some of the Star Trek series(which I still enjoy).  It's very refreshing.  My 12 year old son and I are watching the DVD's together.  When I told him that it was cancelled and there were no new episodes he looked like I just told him his dog died.  Hopefully this garbage reality show fad will pass and we can get back to some quality programming.
B00004RFFS|3.0|The Amazon.com review raves about Cruise's part but I did not enjoy it, he has played in a lot more better roles than this. It's mostly his speech (and Brad Pitts as well) that might me laugh when it was not supposed to.<br />The only actors that get a B or higher are the Interviewer and Antonio Banderas who's already Spanish accent is fitting.<br />It does look real and it that case I never got the feeling of watching a horrible slasher movie, the story is the highlight of the movie and therefore still worth watching. Somehow I still feel it could have been done better than this.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I realize that this kind of music can be catchy and misleading, especially when the production is quite good. It may sounds like something totally new but it's still \\"pop\\" - nothing really ambitious or interesting. What's this message all about? Is there any message at all? I don't think so...<br />Before you buy this CD, just think how much you could kick yourselves. Maybe not now, but someday - when you discover something much more valuable than this \\"ooops\\" stuff... And then you will feel cheated and frustrated. <br />You may buy a different CD instead - like U2 or R.E.M. (it sounds pleasantly but it's still ambitious)... or just give your money for charity... It will be much more useful.
B000002WYT|3.0|Now, don't get me wrong.  Dave Mathews is one of the best songwritters that are alive today, but this is not the best dave mathes CD  If given the choice to buy it again I would not, I would however by Live Att Luther College, which is my very next purchase.  <br />However in this CD you get a studio recording of some of Dave Mathews best songs, such as Crash, Too much, and 41.  But those are just about the only songs I will stop and listen to over and over again.
B00000K3CK|5.0|Having many holiday seasons watched or tried to find it on the seasonal plays on the tele, chose to purchase our own copy.<br />The storyline is solid and acting is good for the times.  The integrity of Kringle and Doris and Susan (can you say Natalie Wood! how neat!)et al is very good.  It makes for great viewing.  Neat really to go back and understand the cultural climate at its making.  Very much more wholesome attitude going on here.<br />The psychogist (William Frawley) is excellent as well.  The miracle of the story is fantassy alright, but this is its charm and the charm of the times --- not our nowadays stuckness on blood and guts and supercreatures, etc.  Kids as they get older certainly can be exposed to the truth about Nick, but when younger, this can be a fun time for their rising imagination.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable.
B000000OTU|4.0|This is a pretty good cd! Has alot of good songs on it! This is a great cd for someone who wants the later greatest hits of Aerosmith without paying the price for&quot;Young Lust/The Aerosmith Anthology&quot;! Recomended for cheap asses like me! I got my Aerosmith Anthology for my birthday so i didn't pay for it! lol!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This disc is great for those who need sleep and are afraid of sleeping pills.you'll be in snooze world before you can say, where's the remote.What a waste of talent.Murray and Johansson deserved better than this coma of a script!
B00005OAE6|5.0|This is my personal favorite cd of Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band!From everthing to the rockin'song like:&quot;Old Time Rock &amp; Roll&quot; &amp; &quot;Feel Like A Number&quot; to the ballads like: &quot;Still The Same&quot; &amp; &quot;We've Got Tonight&quot;! I must say if every song on this cd was released as a single they all would have been huge hits! My person favorite song on this cd is&quot;The Famouse Last Scene&quot;! I think anybody who don't have this cd in there house are Strangers to good music!
B000088E6P|1.0|The 2004 Grammy's voters proved what I have always thought....50 Cents is not talented!! For the first time (in a long time), the Grammy voters did the right by not giving an imposter an award. This cd sold hot, but it is not respected. 50 Cents even lost &quot;Best New Artist&quot; and had the nerve to get on stage to &quot;protest&quot;. He only made himself look bad because no one saw his point (even his fellow rappers thought it was in bad taste). The worst offense to rap music this year is 50 Cents's &quot;Get Rich Or Die Tryin&quot; which is painfully dated. Gangsta rap died when 2Pac and Biggie died. Plus, this cd is not even &quot;gangsta&quot;. Its corporate mindless rap, meant only to make money. I hope 50 realizes that his time is almost up.

0385504209|1.0|I had heard so much about this book and about how fantastic it was.  I tried, I really tried to like the Da Vinci Code, but I could not finish it.<br />It has a great story line, and Mr. Brown could have created great twists and turns with it--but he ran out of gas.  His style included a big twist (like a murder) in the story--then for twenty pages, the characters would talk about it.  Another big twist; and another twenty pages of discussion.<br />That, and the fact he took true facts, tweaked them considerably, and then presented them to the reader as fact.<br />I would have even liked if the book if it had been well written, but it was not.  Run on sentences, changes of person and numerous other discretions of writing made for a very choppy read.<br />I really tried to like this book, but could not.
B000002U94|4.0|I'm not one for live cds but i must say this is one of the best! The only other live cds that i can say even compare are kiss &amp; ac/dc! In my oppinion i This this much better than&quot;Live Bullet&quot;! The track list is much better &amp; seger's voice is much stronger! Highly recomended if u like live recordings!
0375703764|3.0|While I'm not a big horror fan in general, I enjoy a good psychologically scary story now and then, and I'd heard so much about this novel's unique set up that I was intrigued enough to give it a shot. My overall opinion is mixed. I found The Navidson Record portion itself fascinating, but after a while the lengthy footnotes from the narrator about the effect it had on his life, bored me. A large part of the problem for me was realizing early on that Johnny Truant was kind of a jerk BEFORE he stumbled across the manuscript. I couldn't muster much sympathy for him as his life fell apart, nor could I help but think that if finding the Navidson Record hadn't driven him into a personal hell, eventually the drug ridden lifestyle he was already leading surely would have. In addition, the one word per page and upside down text sections, which seemed intended to give the impression that you were reading this the same way Truant was, as a bunch of papers slapped together, just got annoying after a while and made the book way too long. In short, my three star rating is broken down as: 2 stars for The Navidson Record, 1 star for originality of design, and zero stars for unlikeable slacker Johnny Truant and his descent into madness. While I'm not sorry I read it, it's not one I'd re-read or highly recommend.
B00008WT5M|5.0|This is a great ACDC cd! I love ACDC's music &amp; always have!

0156027321|5.0|I began to wait.  My thoughts swung wildly.  I was either fixed on practical details of immediate survival or transfixed by pain, weeping silently, my mouth open and my hands at my head (111).<br />Although we are humans, set apart from other animal species due to our superior intelligence and innovation, we still possess remnants of animal instinct, and these remains shine through in times of crisis, when our livelihood is threatened.  I'm sure you've felt it.  That piercing tug in your chest, that involuntary tension in your throat, that off kilter feeling when your heart races and flutters... And with a quick skin-tingling shudder, it's over, and you realize that you have had a brush with death.  Okay, you may have just fallen off your bike, or just barely swerved in time to avoid that semi, but the feeling is the same.  Your entire existence feels threatened, and in that instant when all that is familiar to you could be snatched from your grasp, thoughts of confusion, panic, and fear crowd your mind.  If the endangering moment lasts longer than a few seconds, this bestial survival motive takes over.  You find yourself pushing emotions to the wayside, giving means of survival precedence over all else.  You hurriedly construct a plan of attack, put it into action, and hope for the best.  If your plan works and you survive, you develop an adjusted outlook on life.  It may not be permanent.  It may be merely ephemeral.  Either way, a near death experience, a struggle for survival, changes you.  You may find yourself pondering life and its blessings.  You may feel bitter and abhor the world for putting you to the test.  You may question the reality of the relationships, people, and things around you.  You may contemplate religion or politics.  You may come to an epiphany or you may just cloud your mind further.  Some kind of magnetic faith or hope guided you this far...   But where does this conviction leave you in the end?<BR>Life of Pi by Yann Martel tells the story of a sixteen year old boy named Pi and his struggle for survival on the open sea when he is shipwrecked on a lifeboat with four unlikely companions: a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger.  Pi finds himself in this inconceivable predicament after his father, a zookeeper, informs the family that they are to move from Pondicherry, India to Canada.  This necessitates the family and the animals to travel by sea to this grossly foreign place.  Tragedy strikes in its usual fashion, and as Pi finds himself stranded as the sole human survivor, he must struggle to survive and stand up to the perils of nature and the high sea, not to mention the threat of wild animals on board.  Thus, this spiritual young boy sets out on a triumphant quest for survival and along the way questions the mysterious notion of faith in God and its role in meaningful existance.<BR>Yann Martel uses the voice of Pi looking back at his incomprehensible feat to narrate the story, a wise choice in that it more personally connects readers to the main character right from the start.  Immaculate in formulation, the commentary of Pi is simple to follow, casually, yet deliberately spoken, and ultimately vivid in the description of action and scenery.  \\"Warmth came only when the sun, looking like an electrically lit orange broke across the horizon, but I didn't need to wait that long to feel it.  With the very first rays of light it came alive in me: hope.  As things emerged in outline and filled with colour, hope increased until it was like a song in my heart.  Oh, what it was to bask in it!\\" (119).  Mr. Martel's language is inarguably encapsulating, exuding richness and a magnetic quality that demands attention from any reader.  Life of Pi is full of passages like these, crafted like an artist or a cinematographer, assessing fluidity, balance, smoothness, and form.   Pi also continually expresses underlying inquisitiveness, endlessly pondering deeply moral questions but not forgetting the truedireness of his situation. Pi realizes that in order to survive, he must come to grips with his spirituality and its role in his life.  This understanding shines through in his voice when he brings forth profound statements such as this: \\"Despair was a heavy blackness that let no light in or out.  It was a hell beyond expression.  I thank God it always passed... The blackness would stir and eventually go away, and God would remain, a shining point of light in my heart.  I would go on loving\\" (209).  In order that this novel not be merely a catalog of Pi's staid thoughts and philosophies, Yann Martel balances such serious contemplation with humor and wit, thus making Pi an even more personable narrator.<BR>Mr. Martel includes a contrasting voice throughout the novel as well.  This voice is that of the fictitious author who recounts Pi's life story through interview and observation.  These intermittent vignettes depicting Pi in the present day, display a convincing, yet deceptive impression that this third party narrator is Yann Martel and that Pi Patel in actually told this story to him.  This fact adds a dose of realism to the novel and you may find yourself, as I did, wanting to believe that this whole story is true.<BR>Yann Martel's literary strengths command this novel and he appeases to the challenge of creating a fun, exciting, and deeply meaningful story that impacts readers beyond imagination.  He strives to provoke questions of faith and relationships in the minds of the readers, urging us to contemplate our inner strength and being and awaken the child-like imagination, hope, and curiosity, deeply recessed within each of us.

B00008OLYN|5.0|I'm really glad to see that most people aren't bashing Opeth for this soft, NON-METAL CD that I find amazing.  It shows how much talent they have.  Some say they aren't doing anything new, but when culture is dominated by Limp Bisquicks, Not so Good Charlottes, and 'guest rappers', something like this is very refreshing.  People mistakenly rate music on how 'new' or 'original' it sounds.  While originality is a good quality to have, the overall rating should be about how good the music actually sounds and if the musicians producing it are actually talented people who care about making music first, and making the $$$ second.  To me, the music sounds pretty damn good.<br />Bottom Line:<BR>An amazing album from a talented band, but NOT the kind of thing they usually do and don't expect too much of this kind of music from them in the future!  It really goes to show you that they could just write stuff like this and forget their metal aspect, in doing so becoming very popular and *shudders* radio friendly, but they don't because they aren't just in it for the money.  So, I reccomend Still Life or Blackwater Park to anyone who wants to know what Opeth is really all about.<br />Least Favorite Track: (they are all so good, it's just easier this way)<BR>Death Whispered a Lullaby - This one just never got to me like the others did...I suppose it's because I don't like the lyrics so much but that's just my opinion and I'm sure it'l appeal to the right kind of person.
B00004THDI|3.0|This is a question and not a review.  Is this disc multi-channel or just stereo?  <br />For the guys that were complaining about getting this disk and not being able to play it on their cd, if you had looked further down the page (after searching for John Barry) you would have seen the standard cd.  Amazon should probably do a better job of letting you know that you are ordering a SACD and make you acknowledge that before processing the order.  Also, some SACDs will play on normal cd players.  They're labelled as Hybrid disks meaning they will play on SACD players and on CD players.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Watching this movie is like getting on your roof at 9pm and waiting for the sunrise.  You might have all the patience in the world and it's still a bad idea.<br />Scarlett's performance is like a long, slow Calvin Klein commercial, and Bill Murray - and I am a big fan - simply chose the wrong script.  That's assuming there was a script because that would imply that something, anything, developed in this movie.  It didn't.<br />The movie ended as it began - with everyone in my family room wondering what the movie would be about.  When the credit's ran, there was a long silence in my house, people sipped their wine, avoided eye contact, until finally someone couldn't hold it anymore and snorted a laugh out their nose, which started the only noteworthy moment of emotion during the evening.  I've been laughing with Bill Murray for years - I've just never laughed at him before.<br />I guess if you went to art school this might be an interesting example of an understated love story intertwined in the human condition or something, but if you work and do laundry and drive kids to school like me, it's just a waste of two hours, which in my world is huge.<br />My wife paid $14 for this movie and I will gladly take 14 cents for it.  Any takers?<br />Sorry, Bill :)
B00005JMCN|5.0|Terrific movie!  It takes a little while to really get into the film because director Gary Ross takes his time introducing and setting the characters played by Jeff Bridges, Chris Cooper, and Tobey Maguire.  Half an hour into the film though, the viewer will be totally immersed.  The documentary-style that Ross uses throughout the film gives the plot a true historical feel.  The narration by author David McCullough is splendid, by the way!<br />Most definitely a feel-good movie, &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; will have a majority of viewers teary-eyed by the film's conclusion.  By now most of the country is aware of the plotline, so I won't waste any time rehashing it for the readers of this review.  Suffice it to say, that like most films of this nature ---&quot;man (beast) gets knocked down, dusts off, and becomes better because of it...&quot;--- the average viewer will come away with some warm and fuzzy feelings.  &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; is no different.<br />Jeff Bridges is outstanding in that understated way of acting that he does so well.  William Macy is an &quot;over-the-top&quot; radio man who captures the excitement that people of that era felt when they got a chance to see Seabiscuit live or hear of the horse's exploits via the airwaves.  The cinematography is outstanding and Randy Newman's score is a wonderful part of the excellence of this film.<br />Highly recommended for those who enjoy the &quot;Hoosiers&quot; and &quot;Rudy&quot;-type movies.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This is a very definitive collection of Phil Collins' greatest hits of his 17 year career (at the time of this CD's release year) and is an essential collection for both novice and longtime fans alike. <br /> The 80s singles that dominate most of this collection are among the most memorable and classiest hits that that amazing decade offered and still stand well even today. His 1990s songs have unfortunately fared less well but at least have some spot on this collection and &quot;Both Sides of The Story&quot; is a truly powerful socially-conscious classic with a sad story behind it. <br /> The previously unreleased song called &quot;True Colors&quot; is a great cover of the Cyndi Lauper classic and improves on the original version. <br /> Go and buy this collection. It's a great investment.
B00005JLSE|4.0|It's interesting that a musical that was not a hit when it premiered in the 70s has become such a massive hit as a movie, especially in an era when so few Broadway musicals have been transposed to the screen. Fosse's shows have never been mass audience favorites, dealing, as they so often do, with the darkest sides of the human condition. And yet the film version of Chicago has been a near universal hit.<br />Certainly a lot of the popularity of Chicago has been a consequence of the popular cast, who may have been hired for their star qualities, but who- without exception- turned in first rate performance. Who would have thought, for example, that Richard Gere would deliver such a good musical performance, or that Queen Latifa would be so good in traditional Broadway material? I'm sure these two alone brought a lot of people into the theater. The real stars of course are Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellwiger, whose song and dance routines impressed even those critics who panned the show as a whole.<br />I also suspect that part of the greater success of the film over the stage version is that today's audiences are more conditioned to expect the dark and ironic in the musical theater. And this show is nothing if not dark. The message, if there is one, is that content is nothing and appearance is everything. Perhaps, then, &quot;Chicago&quot; is the perfect musical for 90s.
6304779356|3.0|I would have given the Lost Boys 3 and a half stars but I couldn't so I just gave it 3 stars.  The Lost Boys is a fun movie to watch and it has its moments.  If you want to see a nostalgic 80's movie well look no further because it reeks of the 80's everywhere you look in it.  It is a cool movie and all the actors play there roles really well.  After I saw Speed 2: Cruise Control, I never wanted to see another Jason Patric movie, but he played the role of Michael really well.  As did his younger brother Sam, played by Corey Haim.  Haim was beaten with an 80's stick as you can tell by his clothing and hair but he plays his role well as a obnoxious little brother.  Keifer Sutherland also stars in this movie and it was one of his better roles he has played in his movies.  I noticed with movies starring Sutherland he plays the role of being a bad guy really well.<br />This is a brief plot synopsis of the Lost Boys.  Michael, Sam, and his mother move to California from Phoenix.  The town looks cool but it is has a vampire problem.  Michael gets an eye for a girl named Star and he finds out she isn't a normal teenage girl.  He then gets tricked by Sutherland who is a vampire and Michael becomes a vampire then too.  I don't feel like telling the rest of the story so just watch the movie.<br />Like I said earlier The Lost Boys is entertaining and it reeks of the 80's.  I have heard some people say it is the best vampire movie of all time.  I don't think so, just because this is alittle too light hearted to be considered the best.  Personally I would have to say Interview with the Vampire is the best.  I have never seen Nosferatu but I've heard great things about that.<br />The DVD itself is nothing special.  The special features aren't anything great and the interactive menus aren't animated at all.  So if you are the type who cares about kind of stuff you will be disapointed.  The picture and sound quality isn't bad though and that is the only thing that really should matter when it comes to Dvd's.<br />So if you are looking for a good movie that will entertain you and is a fun vampire movie then look no further to the Lost Boys.<br />Movie - B<br />DVD (special features, animated interactive menus) - Dtter when it comes to Dvd's.<br />So if you are looking for a good movie that will entertain you and is a fun vampire movie then look no further to the Lost Boys.<br />Movie - B <BR>DVD (special features, animated interactive menus) - D
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a great film. It has beautiful created animation. Hayao Miyazaki brings us into a strange and beautiful world where Chihiro is the outsider. I liked the part about the river god, that looked like stink monster at first. I believe this is suppose to show us how a river can go from a beautiful river to a sewer if we keep doing things to it, but it can be saved. This DVD had some good special features Nippon Television Special was very interesting, it was nice to see the animators at work and the voices behind the animated features. When I watched it again, I watched it with the English 2 (I believe) subtitles on. The ones that show you what would be said if it was just translated to English without changes. I could see why they made some changes. Also, at the end credits you can see what the end song words are.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is a personal album, that can related to everyone. From beautiful to dirrty &quot;and don't say you arent dirrty, well unless your a nun&quot;. Buy this album now, and you'll see you will never have any regrets with buying this great album.
B00005JLK1|4.0|As far as horror movies go this is a vast improvement over &quot;fear.com&quot; and &quot;The Ring&quot; in my opinion. Plenty of decent acting, a good story and action, and some great special effects. The sets, costumes and music are all well done, especially in the flashbacks. I never knew what to expect and the flashbacks to the original ship and story behind it were great. Definitely a surprise ending as well.<br /><br /> I plan to buy the two pack of &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; and &quot;Thirteen Ghost&quot;. Both these movies are quite good. I do not recommend them for children under twelve as they contain a fair amount of blood and gore. I have seen the two pack for less than twenty dollars. To me they are both a notch above some of the horror schlock I have seen released lately. The picture and sound quality on this DVD are excellent.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Elephant is a very uneven and overated album. I'm sorry but such a minimalist band like the White Stripes has no room to experiment like they have tried to do on this album. They should just stick to what they do best, ala The Strokes. \\"Seven nation army\\" and \\"Hardest button to button\\" are good, excellent in fact. \\"Hypnotize\\" and \\"Black math\\" are very nice too. But then we have crap like \\"Ball and biscuit\\", \\"Little acorns\\", \\"In the cold cold night\\" and the depressing ballad \\"You've got her in your pocket\\" which sounds corny as hell. There's also an awful cover of a burt bacharach song. I appreciate the Stripes trying new things but it all sounds too gimmicky to me.
B00008CLOA|4.0|You've heard the songs one way or the other, you know what to expect except that they redid the album so that it would sound better so.....? Do I need to say anymore. Shall I mention that I love On The Run and no matter how I want to say I hate this since it's so popular I just can't. It's infectious but I still retain that this album is not as good as Meddle and any of the ones before this - it's not even as good as Animals but it is still really good. In the end - you will buy this album and despite trying to hate it you will actually possibly begin to like it and well......maybe reviews for this album are a pointless thing after all<br />Oh and let's set the record straight.....they were not on drugs...if you thought that they were I'd hate to imagine your reaction to Piper At The Gates Of Dawn.....that really was a druggy album but it was because of Syd Barrett and not the rest of the band but that's a different story
B000002TQV|4.0|Very good album by Radiohead, although i can't say i hold it in the same regard as some people. This is easily their most accessible album and much stronger than Pablo honey. Songs such as &quot;fake plastic trees&quot;, &quot;Just&quot;, &quot;Bullet proof...i wish i was&quot; and the title track are why so many people have fallen in love with this band. Not quite as perfect as their follow up Ok Computer, but The Bends is still an essential 90s rock album.
B00012QM8G|4.0|I am not a fan of Steven Spielberg, in fact I do consider him childish and unable to deal with serious topics in a mature complex matter. In fact , there is always his annyoing childlike view of the world underneath the surface of the technical brilliance that characterizes his films. It would be unfair to call Shind´ler´s List biased against Germans. That would be idiotic as the very hero of the story is German himself.<BR>Yet one has to look pretty deeply to see Spielbergs resentments.<BR>- The role of Amon Goeth, the Austrian SS Commanderof Plaszow was to be casted with a German Actor at first, Spielberg wanted Goetz George, who is a known acto in Germany and who until today openly admitted his suffering from his fathers (Heinrich George) appearance in Nazi Propagande flicks during the 1930s. George declined Spielbergs offer vehemnetly as he knew that working with a notorious German hating dircetor like Spielberg who is known for bitching around on the set is nothing a serious actor would want. Strangely though the \\"good German\\" Oskar Shindler himself is played by an American, how authentic. <BR>So instead an \\"ugly Brit\\" like Ralph Fiennes has to do the job.<BR>Goetz George had no problem whatsoever to play the Auschwitz war criminal Mengele in \\"After the Truth\\", a film that was made five years after SL.<br />- Spielberg many times admitted that he felt repulsion for the German actors who played the SS. Well, it was Spielberg who wanted them to wear the uniform, not themselves. Also again, why not use Americans for them as well ??? How about Ed Harris or Clint \\"Granite Face\\" Eastwood as the guy who shoots the kid ??? No that job needs to be done by the Germans of course. Every German actor with a bit of self esteem should turn down any offer from Spielberg. The biggest insult was that Spielberg received the Bundeverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) from the German government. <br />- Recently the German TV channel VOX broadcasted a two hour special about thereal Shindler. The had shown the original footage of Amon Goeth´s execution by the Russians. Goeth did neither lift his arm for a last Sieg Heil nor did the Russians had to kick the bucket three times underneath his feet. He was hanged at a makeshift gallow without any emotional reaction.<BR>The survivors of Plaszow themselves said in the interviews that the movie treis to bring the horror close to the viewer yet does not come even close to the real atrocities commited by Goeth.<BR>Also GOeth had two housemaids called Helene. On said in the interview that Goeth´s affcetion for her in portrayed in the film was just another Hollywood invention. In reality he just would mistreat his slave workers without warning and with absolute cruelty. <BR>Spielberg could not resist to add Hollywood cliche to the film.<BR>Something he did in every \\"serious\\" film he ever directed (and ruined).<br />Except for that Shindler´s List is one of the better films about the Holocaust, although there is no film that can bring the Holocaust \\"close\\" to the viewer. As film always creates a \\"safe distance\\". The best would be to visit one of the Concentration camp memorial sites at Auschwitz or Belsen. That is a haunting experience.
B000001FDK|5.0|This is absolutely the best CD.  I listen to it often, even at school.  There is not a bad song on the whole CD honestly.  It never ceases to put me in a great mood.
B00009W0U4|2.0|At first let me say that even if u are a gorehound and think that u have seen the &quot;nasties out there&quot;, this film will still hit u like a hammer. In fact it will take some time to get over the face crushing scene, which is indeed irreversibly traumatic for the viewer. The official homepage of Irreversible offers a clip about the making of the gore effect which can help to take some impact out of that shocking moment. Yet it still hit u hard as it goes deep into the subconsciousness of human fear, fear of mutilation and disfigurement. Also the rape scene should be mandatory viewing for men who play down domestic violence against women. It hurts to realize that there are men who do such incredibly cruel things to women. <br />Yet Gaspar Noe has produced another movie that goes with a new trend in Euro cinema that I consider questionable. He does have a point though, the fact that the whole story is told backwards leaves u with a bad feling as u know that the beautiful Monica Bellucci we see at the end of the film will end up molested and brutally battered. Life is hell and men are beasts. Bottom line of the film. It shows the effect of vigilancy and how the vicious circle of violence drags everyone deeper and deeper into destruction. Yet the &quot;New Euro Cinema&quot; still does not offer what it lacked for so many years, GOOD STORIES. Hollywood on the one hand has fallen into the trash can of commercialized nonsense and loveless self promotion. Yet the Euro front, especially French cinema obviously feels that the apathy of modern movie goers needs to be filled with ever growing shocks and breaking of taboos. However if u are looking for a film that will haunt u in your dreams, watch this one, but do not expect too much just because it has the label &quot;Non-Hollywood&quot; on it.
B000089RVX|5.0|Man!I don`t have enough words to describe this AWESOME ALBUM,the only thing that i can say is &quot;BUY IT NOW IF U LIKE TO HEAR SOME REAL MUSIC&quot;.Although this album is not for the &quot;KIDS&quot; who like to &quot;sucks the lollypops&quot; like beyonce,justin etc.
B000002UEB|5.0|In 1988, two great progressive rock concept albums were released. Iron Maiden's 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son' and Queensryche's 'Operation: Mindcrime'.<BR>Bassist and key song writter of Iron Maiden, Steve Harris once said in an interview in 1989 that 'Operation: Mindcrime' should have been the album that they recorded, suggesting that the quality of Maiden's album did not match the high level that was Operation: Mindcrime. Although I love 'Seventh Son of a Seventh Son', 'Operation: Mindcrime' was untouchable.<br />'Operation: Mindcrime' is undoubtably the strongest and most inspiring album in Queensryche's  recorded cataloge. Powerful, moving and completely original, 'Operation: Mindcrime' is blessed from start to finish. It is one of the rare albums that can be easily listerned to in it's intiretly while keeping you captivated throughout. Every track is well crafted and cleverly written but it is it's underlining theme and story that makes 'Operation: Mindcrime' one of the greatest concept albums, not just in progressive rock  but in any genre of music. It is an immersive album that takes it's listerner on an intense journey, very much like a great film, and is far more than just words and music.<BR>Every member of Queensryche makes this album special as no idividual is unheard or dominating, although vocalist, Geoff  Tate performs with such range, dynamics, tone and emotion that it's hard to not credit him alone for the brilliance of this album.  Both guitarists Chris DeGarmo and Mike Wilton are like telepathic twins, resorting to rich chordal voicings rather than the standard power chords and arranging totally independant guitar parts from each other spreading the sonics of this album. A sound many guitarists  have been influenced by such as those in band's like Dream Theater and Fates Warning. Scott Rockenfield's intricate drumming excells with Eddie Jackson's fat yet tight growling bass tone. Jackson's bass playing feature melodically on this album unlike most of the following recordings, which also makes me appriciate 'Mindcrime' all the more.<BR>It is with a hint of sadness that Queensryche have never really touched on the magic of this album since, offering only moments of magic on 'Empire' and 'Promised Land', though neither come close. Sadder still are the last three efforts from the band - ('Hear In The Now Frontier', 'Q2K' and recently 'Tribe' ) - which are not abominations, but watery nothings compared to 'Operation Mindcrime' . Queensryche as of the late 90's leave me feeling uninspired and indifferent. <br />Without critizing the band too much for their average albums of today, let the magic of this masterpiece be remembered and the name Queensryche be held with the greatest respect. 'Operation Mindcrime'  is a superb album with typifies the creative peak of a band that most people have long forgotton.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's newest cd Closer is quite different from the norm out there.  Four different languages take us from the inspirational You Raise Me Up, to the european, french tracks, a couple of spanish songs, and my favorite for Josh's voice, italian.  His voice, and Joshua Bell's melodic violin, on Mi Mancherai brings me to tears every time I hear it.  His collaborations with Deep Forest are stand-outs too.  It's no wonder why he is gaining fans all across the world.  Josh's music is such a wonderful change from all of the same ol' same ol' that's being produced these days.
B00003CXA2|3.0|Forrest gump may have been a good movie but thats no excuse for setting an example that a redneck from alabama turns into all the things fellow people of today wish to do or be. I just don't see how this movie convinces me of believing in a word called luck. For god sake, this movie offened a top preformer, Elvis, and said that he stole the hip swinging from a dumb kid with an IQ of 75. Not real enough but still good to watch if you want to get your mind off the world we live in today and live in a fantasy land like forrest gump did.
B000002RXS|5.0|The reviewer from San Diego doesn't even know how to spell &quot;Carmen&quot;, that much for his dreadful knowledge. This Carmen is perhaps the HOTTEST, most BURNING and FATAL performance of this opera ever recorded. In 1964 Callas mezzo-range was her HUGE plus. A brilliant chanson de boheme, esp. the FIERCE Tralala! Nicolai Gedda doesn't sound as sumptuos as on the recording with de los Angeles but his diction is flawless, his timbre beautiful and his interpretation magnificent. Robert Massard is underrated, a STUNNING Escamillo. Also look for his Athanael in &quot;Thais&quot;. (Massenet) A stunning Carmen, not to be missed!!!!!
0790729652|5.0|This movie is beyond the best and no doubt one of my favorite movies. The scene of Gotham city will keep you watching it over and over again. Its one of those movies that will keep you waiting for the sequel.
B0000C1733|4.0|Like many greatest hits albums, this one is afraid to give us a thoroughly great play list.  A lot of the songs are good on this album, but not all - you will have to skip some.  If you're looking for the one Chili Peppers album to own, because you're not a big enough fan to buy all or many of their albums, this one will fall short as many of their greatest hits are omitted.  Still, it's a good album and probably worth your time.  Unfortunately, your going to have to buy more if you want to experience all of your favorites.
B0000931QR|5.0|Ignore all of the few bad reviews for this cd. This cd is truly a historic landmark in music. Amaia's sweet voice sooths you and kind of hypnotizes you into liking this music. Although LQTCMTHLD is my first purchased LODVG cd, I've fallen in love with the band. All of the songs are totally brilliant. Everyone has to love track #14, History of a dream. It is just a beautiful song. Buy this cd now!
078324228X|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time last nite, I dont know how I never heard of it, or the story of Hurricane Carter but I had not.<br />I really liked this Movie (until I did my homework). The Movie was very powerfull leaving you in disbelief, how could this happen? How could a innocent man be sentenced to Life for a crime he didnt commit? <br />The Movie's 2nd half left me teary eyed of the injustice done to Hurricane Carter and very touched by the young man that wrote, visited &amp; belived in his innocence and who along with his Canadian Family worked so hard to free him. <br />Denzel Washington Does an exceptional peformance, what a great actor, But SHAME ON YOU Mr. Washington, This Movie is Based More on Lies than on the Truth, you were one of my favorite Actors, but your credibility has suffered, you had to of known of the Untruths of this Movie, and then to embrace Hurricane Carter and make a statement that this man is full of Love?<br />I gave this Movie 5 Stars because it was entertaining. The Movie left me with wanting more, immeadiately after watching the movie I did a search on Boxer Hurricane Carter. The First site was:<br />[...]<br />My first impression was, Wow this must be some Racial Web Site against Hurricane Carter, but after spending hours reading all the many pages of well documented articles and interviews, my conclussion is their is more evidence that this man, Hurricane Carter is a Guilty as charged, than an innocent man wrongly accused as partrayed in the Movie.
B00005JKN9|5.0|This is a pretty good historical film on gang wars during the middle and late 1800's. It may not be totally historically accurate, but the feel and look of this time period is dead on. Leonardo and Cameron are okay, but nobody can compare to the brute force and flat out great acting ability of Daniel Day-Lewis. His portrayal of the ruthless Bill the Butcher should have won him the Oscar last year, not that human twig Adrien Brody who only had about twelve lines of dialogue in \\"The Pianist.\\" DDL has always been good at totally changing his look and accent to fully become the character, much like Johnny Depp. DDL was in retirement from acting for over five years before he decided to do this film. If this indeed is his last on screen performance, he will be remembered for it forever. Not only because it was his personal best, but because it is one of the best overall performances in the history of cinema.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Radiohead produces some very good music - compared to the current radio fodder out there.  It is very nice that 20 somethings dig this as it is densely atmospheric and layered - two hallmarks of a 'prog rock' sound.  But the rhythms are really hohum.  Yes, halcionic and I do dig this slow trip sometime, but if you really want to experience what progressive rock has to offer and arent afraid you should check out more of the ProgRock genre - the current breed includes many great artists and sounds that are truly interesting and cutting edge.  Try Thinking Plague, Spock's Beard, Flower Kings, Anekdoten, Smokin' Granny, and the always present and fantastic King Crimson.  Keep Expanding kids...dont stop here.   [...]
B000002C1V|2.0|Really the only reason I got this album was because I heard the refrain of &quot;Your Possible Pasts&quot;, and thought it was great, and it is. But if I had known how boring and unmelodic the rest of the album was, I would not have touched it. Without Richard Wright's amazing keyboard contributions, it just makes this album pathetic and not even a Pink Floyd album. But I do think it is a great Roger Waters album. Probably his best. I mean even David Gilmour's guitar work (even though he's my alltime favorite guitarist) is totally different. Instead of that bluesy style he's famous for, he put in alot of harmonics and scales that are reminiscent of 80s rock n' roll, which, lets all admit, sucked. Nick Mason doesnt get to shine like he used to because Waters basically forced him to suck. If you get the chance, buy the DVD &quot;Pink Floyd Live In Pompeii&quot;. It really lets you see how great all four members of the Floyd were.<BR> But anyway, The Final Cut is basically a boring plodding album missing much rhythm. And it is the first Floyd album to have a song including the word &quot;f*ck&quot;, which, to me, is kind of a big deal. But anyway, I much prefer &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Dark Side&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot;...and, well, all the albums by the Floyd before this one.
1843650495|5.0|The Book little women is a classic tale of four sisiters liveing with there mother, there father risking his life in the civil war. it tells what it was like to be a girl in the times of the  war.

Meg the eldest sister is about fitting in and watching over her sisters when ever there mother is not around. Beth loves her music andthere old piano, she seems like one of shyest and careing of all the sisters. all of them are different but they all have one thing in comon, there family and they care for each other.   <br />i love the illustrations of Dinah Dryhurst. the pictures bring the story to life. they are Beautifuly done.
B00000IGGA|5.0|This is not an album that lets you in the first time you listen to it, or even the second, or the third.  This isn't pop music.  If you listen closely, though, you can hear just about every face that Tom Waits has ever showed the world, which is appropriate considering that this was his swan song (say it ain't so!).  There are some songs that would be right at home on Closing Time; others seem to be tracks that were left off of Bone Machine.<br />If you keep at it, one day it'll go 'pop'.  Suddenly you'll hear the subtle and not-so-subtle twists and turns and variations in the music and the words.  You'll find the improbable links between the likes of What's He Building and Hold On.  You'll wander through a maze of carnival characters and whimsical malcontents, not to mention the occassional wack-o.<br />Waits manages to give his characters depth and nuance; he makes them empathetic and sometimes outright pathetic, all in the space of five or six minutes.  Each one takes the stage, does a dance, and then retires back into the smokey backlight to make room for the next.<br />To be sure, your ear will take some time adjusting to the likes of Big in Japan or Cold Water.  Believe it or not, though, one day you'll find yourself humming the improbable opening to the album and getting puzzled looks from passers-by.<br />I can only suggest that you buy this album, and if it doesn't grab you right away give it some time - I was turned off the first time I bought it and actually returned it.  That was three years ago, and I regret the time not spent getting acquainted with some of Waits' finest!
B00006LPEY|5.0|This movie is spectacular. During the first half I was slightly confused about o couple of thing.But it was all soon answered. There is also ALOT of bloody action this can be both good and bad. The ending is very thought provoking, like when Kanada goes into Tetsuo and sees his childhood memories, and will stay in your mind for a couple of days as you try to realise what exactly happened(i still havent figured it all out which is why im going to watch it again) Trust me you will get up thinking &quot;wow,that was sweet!&quot;
B000088E6D|5.0|Gotta find a special gift for that someone special. This is the perfect choice. I've given 6 Michael Buble disks out so far this year and #7 will go on the 14th to my lucky lady. Everyone loves Michael so it's a no brainer. <BR>I made reservations for us to see him at the Borgata again and with a little luck we'll see him at the Mohegan Sun to.<BR>Michael Buble IS my best choice for cd gift giving.
0156027321|5.0|First off, this book rocks!! I usually cannot get interested in books, but this one is great.  It's a beautiful book, combining the importance of faith and the realities of life.  Impossible to put down, and highly recomended!
B00005JMCN|2.0|At best, Seabiscuit is a mediocre movie.  It's really baffling that it could receive a best picture nomination during such a good movie year.  Even Cold Mountain, which teetered towards being too typically \\"Hollywood\\" seemed a better choice.  And, I really had expected this to be a good movie.  It's based on a good story and has an outstanding cast, and horse films usually allow for some powerful effects (think of The Black Stallion).  The third person narration was just a signal of an uninteresting directing style and emotional spoon-feeding. 5/10
B00005JMTN|3.0|What is it with so many Tim Burton movies?  Visually they are an absolute treat...full of invention and a sense of almost childlike wonder.  But when it comes to revealing the workings of the human heart or clarifying plot developments, he so often falls short.<br />BIG FISH presents us with the best of his good traits, and frankly, the worst of his lesser habits.<br />Visually the movie is stunning.  We've all seen the trailers where Ewan McGregor has time stop for him when he meets the love of his life, and he brushes bits of flying popcorn out of the air as he approaches her.  Very cool.  Sets and costumes are whimsical, in the best sense.  His performers all work hard to get into that same spirit of wacky, not-quite-reality that the film strives to evoke.  I say try.  Often, they fail.<br />BIG FISH is the story of a 30 something son come home to be with his dying father.  They have a strained relationship, because the boy feels he knows nothing about dad.  Dad always just told fanciful stories about his life and adventures...stories far too incredible to be true...and now the son wants the truth, darn it, so he can know dad.<br />Okay.  Fine.  Dad tells some of his old stories again, and the movie shows them played out for us.  The son tries to dig into what really happened.  That's fine too.  But nowhere do we really understand WHY the son needs this (Billy Crudup plays him like the world's biggest party-pooper...he just wants to take dad down a notch or two it would appear).  Dad (played in old age by Albert Finney) clings to his stories, but never seems to acknowledge that his son wants to know if they are true or not.  He just keeps telling them.  He never says \\"Yeah, they're true,\\" or \\"no, they ain't\\" or even \\"what do you thing?\\"  He just tells them. With a twinkle in his eye, true, but he's just a frustrating old-cuss who apparently has not learned to really connect with people.  We hear him talk about the \\"love of his life,\\"  yet he marries her, finds ajob as a traveling salesman, and is hardly ever home to be with the woman he went to huge lengths to win.  And she seems to just glow with love for him...yet we have NO idea why she would love him.  Again, Burton fails to reveal any truths about the human heart.  He's just messing with his viewer.<br />Many of these stories are amusing, true, but there are plenty that aren't all that interesting either.  The mysterious forest that McGregor goes through when he leaves town are phony, phony, phony.  Feel like rejects from the set of Burton's SLEEPY HOLLOW.  Anyway, what of the performances by the VERY promising cast?<br />BILLY CRUDUP is just boring and unlikeable. Right up to the end.  Even when he comes to some sort of \\"realization\\" that kinda makes no sense.<br />ALBERT FINNEY, one of my absolute favorite actors of all time, is okay but unmemorable.  JESSICA LANGE, as Finney's wife, has very little to do but look loving.  <br />ALISON LOHMAN, as the younger Lange, has a great blend of freshness and \\"spunk.\\"  She was great in MATCHSTICK MEN and good in WHITE OLEANDER, and her winning streak continues here.  HELENA BONHAM CARTER is okay in a strange role as one of the many people McGregor meets.<br />And what of Ewan McGregor?  He's another very fine actor, but he's lost here.  I feel like I'm watching his \\"fake\\" character from the amusing DOWN WITH LOVE dropped into this film. The over-the-top accent and goofy smile are EXACTLY the same. As appealing as McGregor is (he just seems like such a nice guy!), his work in BIG FISH is disappointing.<br />The whole movie is disappointing.  I know some people LOVED it, but I was left unmoved and vaguely confused.
B00005JL78|5.0|This movie succeeded everywhere that Spielburg's AI did not, and really got me excited about sci-fi again.  I actually would not have rated Minority Report as highly the first time I saw it, but it only improved in subsequent viewings.  This is really everything a movie should be.  The story flows perfectly, Cruise fits the role, the action is ingenious, and the ideas presented activate the imagination rather than dulling it, like so many movies. 8/10
B0000042HV|5.0|With the Borodin cycles and the Emerson cycle out on CD this very good set tends to get overlooked. There are a lot of things I like about this set better than either the Borodin or Emerson set.<br />I prefer this set to the Borodin set because the engineering is more satisfying. You get a more intimate sound with this set. For those who are curious, the other selling point is that Fitzwilliam gave the Western premiere of the Fifteenth quartet and were one of the last groups to work with the composer before his death. And while the sound isn't as crisp as what you'll find on the Emerson set I prefer their handling of the large-scale structure and emotional content of the 3rd and 7th quartets (not that this is anything other than personal preference).<br />But the most pragmatic reason was price.  I got this set when I could only afford one and this was the only one I could afford. Only after listening to it a lot and researching the history of the quartet did I learn they had worked with the composer. If you can only afford one box set of Shostakovich and have a tight budget this is the one you want.
B000002UAR|3.0|A lot of people have recommended albums from the 1960s for me to listen to.  Out of all of them, this one sounds the most outdated and least representative of good rock music.
B00007G207|3.0|I loved the original version.  I could have lived not knowing Guiseppe Tornatorre's version of it. Left to his own devices, the director made a sappy story about one man's life and loves, instead of one man's life-long passion about films inspired by the projectionist who befriends him in his childhood.
B000002UA9|5.0|Yes. This is it.  The beginning of the turn from the hillbilly country rock performed by Elvis Presley into real rock and roll.  For the next three years, the Beatles would be the undisputed leaders and release some of the best music of all time.
B0000TG9E2|4.0|The latest Disney classic to get the Masterpiece treatment on DVD, \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" comes as a two-disc set complete with trailers, featurettes, and a pristine transfer of the 1951 film.<br />\\"Alice in Wonderland\\" is very good, of course, but pales a bit in relation to \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty\\". While faithful to the original source material, the film still seems a bit thin and perhaps even slightly unsatisfying. Maybe this is because the story is only somewhat linear, and of such a surreal nature that it makes viewing somewhat challenging... well, somewhat.<br />While there are some interesting and fun vintage featurettes and presentations related to \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", the biggest drawback with this set is the glaring lack of a documentary on the creation of the film. After some twenty-odd years of pre-production, plus access to star Kathryn Beaumont, you would think that there would have been enough material to put together such a \\"How They Did It\\" documentary, a standard extra on the other Masterpiece offerings.<br />On the plus side, there is an extended clip from the \\"lost\\" Disney classic, \\"Uncle Remus\\" in one of the featurettes. In recent years, Disney appears to be more and more willing to consider showing some of the politically incorrect bits from its vaults (such as in the \\"Mickey Mouse in Black and White\\" compliation, among others), so perhaps this new (and intellegent) attitude bodes well for the ultimate release of \\"Remus.\\" Well, we can hope so, anyway.<br />While not the best of Disney, \\"Alice\\" is certainly worth a looksee. Some of the techniques used are still superior to the computerized fakery so prevelent in today's animation, and would be instructive to fans and creators of animated film alike.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is one of the greatest.  It is a great investment of your money.  Christina is one of the only truly talented artists out there and it shows.  If you have not listened to this CD then do so right now otherwise you are missing out.
B00006RINF|5.0|Lacuna Coil, Comalies (Century Media, 2002)<br />I have come to believe over the last nine months or so that Lacuna Coil are, quite simply, the second coming of rock and roll. No one else even comes close these days. Comalies, their third full-length release (their back catalogue is bolstered with two excellent EPs, as well), is their best yet.<br />The haunting voice of Christina Scabbia is beautifully utilized in these thirteen (fourteen if you're one of the lucky sods who scored an import copy) tracks. Male vocalist Andrea Ferro gets a lot of flak from fans, but you have to remember, folks, that Lacuna Coil aren't coming out of the goth underground, they're influenced by black and death metal bands; given that, Ferro is entirely in character. He doesn't have any truly great offerings here (like \\"Senzafine\\" or \\"When a Dead Man Walks,\\" both from the Unleashed Memories disc), but he holds his own. The band, as always, crank out a brand of tight, catchy goth-metal that will be immediately familiar to American audiences thanks to Evanescence. Fans of Amy Lee and co., especially those put off by the band's professed following of Christianity, may well find something more to their liking here; the name of the first single from this disc, \\"Heaven's a Lie,\\" should tell you all you need to know about that subject.<br />Lacuna Coil are the band Evanescence want to be when they grow up. If there is any justice in the world, the success of Evanescence will transform Lacuna Coil from a band who tours America headlining 200-500 seat clubs to one selling out 10,000 seat halls in a couple of years. You might as well get in on the ground floor. You can pick up any of their discs at random (I started with In a Reverie), but this is one of many fantastic places to start. **** ½
B00011RPB0|2.0|This is the story of two lonely people, both alone in a strange culture and both questioning where they're at in their lives.  They find each other and supposedly &quot;connect&quot;.  I say supposedly because the way they interacted with each other was annoyingly unrealistic.  Essentially, they just hung out and engaged in stilted small talk for most of the movie, neither of them coming remotely close to exposing their feelings.<br />Oh sure, &quot;non-verbally&quot; they both communicated their situations to the audience, but aren't people going through existential crises supposed to TALK TO EACH OTHER?  All I wanted was for just one little conversation between them that had any depth at all.  I kept thinking it would happen but it never did. (Bill Murrary's character whispered something in her ear during the last scene but since we don't know what it was I'm assuming it also had no depth - probably a knock knock joke or something like that.)<br />The depiction of japanese society was interesting and the film maker did a good job conveying aloneness and alienation.  But don't go into this with really high expectations.<BR><BR>
B000000OAC|5.0|Look at someone's review from July 1999<br />&gt;&gt;As usual, it is Brian's keen rock-n-roll sensibilties and his ace musicianship that saves (!) most of the other songs from absolute boredom (WHAT THE HELL). What would Freddie's &quot;Who Needs You&quot; be without Brian's excellent guitar work (what are you talking about?), and the same goes for Roger's &quot;Fight From The Inside.&quot; Listening to this album today only confirms the feeling I had after my first listen: Brian May is the heart and soul of this band. (Listen to Queen again speak) Without him, Queen would have faded just as quickly as Moot the Hoople, Sweet, and The Bay City Rollers. (How about without Freddie?) &lt;&lt;<br />THIS IS RIDICULOUS. I bet this person's not even a Queen fan. Why is Brian's solo attempt not as popular as Queen, then? Why did Queen never never revive after Freddie Mercury's death? Queen is Queen; without one, they all die. The Beatles was strongest when their music all went individual. Queen was the strongest when they unified. (that's why the Works is not the best album.) Brian is a very very inspiring artist, but WHAT THE HECK I think HE would disagree with this NARROW MINDED opinion about Queen members.<br />Anyways, back to the album. This album ranks fourth in my Queen chart: Queen II/Innuendo tie, A Night At the Opera, Sheer Heart Attack, then this one. HOWEVER, all these albums deserve 100 stars out of 5. The best songs in this album, in my opinion, are We Are the Champions, It's Late (100000 out of 5), Spread Your Wings, and My Melancholy Blues. Just try them out. It's enough to blow your mind away.
B00008DDSA|5.0|This movie is absolutely magnificent.  Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a performance that puts her on a level with Barbara Streisand in &quot;Yentl&quot;.  Furthermore, James Spader's rather disturbing performance is reminscent of a young Chuck Norris in &quot;Invasion U.S.A.&quot;.  The amazing ending reminds me of the ending of &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; only with some killer nude scenes.  If you know what's good for you, you'll buy this movie.  It's kinky :).
6305841861|5.0|This is one of the most brilliant, and gorey horror films I've ever seen!  Ash is the coolest horror hero in movie history. I must admit that I like this movie a lot more than the first Evil Dead, Ash still gets the living crap beat out of him, but he's not completely helpless this time.  He takes matters into his own hands armed with a 12-gauge double-barreled shotgun, and a chainsaw. I find that this movie was very well done, I loved the blood effects.  BUY THIS MOVIE!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I wouldn't think Id be a huge fan of music like this, but I checked it out on Amazon. Went and bought the CD and Im obsessed. These guys are leaps and bounds beyond just about everyone. Buy this CD now.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Listen I'll keep this short. Shania Twain has come a very long way in a very short time. Her songs are well written and well done live. I mean the woman has a beautiful voice but its something about how she carries herself onstage. I recently seen her in Detroit in the 8th row and I have to say she completely captivated me and the entire audience. <BR>This DVD footage is incredible. Its shot along the lake in Chicago on a warm summer night in 2003 just before her current tour began. The crowd is mixed with young-older, male-female you name it. <BR>Shania's band is incredible. I mean they all have great talent but I credit Shania and her producer husband with allowing these band members to roam the stage and have a damn good time. And it shows, these band members are not just something off to the side they are a big part of the show!<BR>Now about Shania. This woman simply has the charisma charm talent and energy to make Chicago get very &quot;UP&quot;....<BR>I highly recommend this DVD its the next best thing to a live concert seat with one of the most beautiful female singers in the world today. Turn up your home theater systems and get ready this lady is going to party..
0385504209|3.0|I think overall the book contains a lot of educational information but the attempt for suspense failed. I was able to read it and put it down for a number of days. The suspense parts were ok but they are so mainstream and not original, it is all something that we have either seen in movies or read in other books. And of course, the mass appeal it is not very attractive.
0345457684|4.0|I won't rehash all the reviews here.  AC is a competently written piece of film-noir SF exploring a world where life is cheap because consciousness can be recorded and a &quot;person&quot; can be rebooted into a new body.   I don't think that all of the ideas are played out consistently (e.g. multiple copies of people seem rare - there doesn't seem to be any kidnapping of downloads).  <br />What puzzles me is the persistent Catholic bashing that pervades the book.  The Vatican is described as the purveyor of every wrong headed, perverse idea, ever.  I could not understand if this was the character (who rebels against authority) or the author's idea.  It stands out because no other religion is mentioned, IIRC.<br />Certainly the world of the novel is portrayed as one without transcendence.  There's just atoms and your info - no higher authority or justice.  And yet the protagonist has visions of a dead comrade, visions that seem to help him.  (These could just be hallucinations).  I thought the author was going to do something with the religious issue but he never followed up.  In the end it just seemed like ranting.<br />Perhaps amazon.com is the wrong place to look for a discussion, but this aspect of the book puzzled me.
0385336942|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I was initially attracted by the subject of balloon bombs and the Alaskan setting.  The author's excellent research would have made this book worthwhile for just those two items; however, the plot and the characters are what made this such a treat to read.  Callanan has done a masterful job weaving a rich tapestry of human emotion, religion, and mysticism against a fascinating historical background.  I hope I do not have to wait too long for his next novel.
0743243153|5.0|A combination of human psychology and spirituality, this book is truly profound!  Dr. Peck has a unique ability to transcend the self-defense system that protects us from having to deal with the real issues behind our actions.  He effectively demonstrates, using sound reasoning and examples, how we grow from our struggles, and why we cannot grow without them.  One could easily view hardship as an exciting opportunity after reading this book.  He also does a wonderful job of describing how love grows through the sacrifices that we make for other people.  In the last section he goes beyond human logic and delves into the sub-conscious and the spiritual, yet it's easy to understand, even if one has no religious background.  In fact, he argues that even atheism is a form of religion in the sense that it is a belief system that guides our behavior, and he does so very diplomatically.  He makes references to religious writings, mostly Christian, but even if I were an atheist or believed in another faith, I don't think I would be offended by this.  Quite to the contrary, atheist would get a good understanding of why some people believe in a higher existence.  As a spiritual person who thinks it's normal for people to struggle with their imperfections, I grew a little tired of his references to psychotherapy and mental illness, but I would not categorize his philosophies as psycho-babble by any means.  He does acknowledge the difference between emotional mental illness, and physical or neurological mental illness (I forget the professional terms), and his book is clearly not intended to undermine the reality of the latter.  There were a few political plugs that I could do without, but it didn't bother me enough to be deterred from finishing the book, and I look forward to reading more of his work.
B0000959N0|4.0|I rented this DVD on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The negative criticisms of this movie are way off base. Good cast, plenty of action and it tugged my heart strings. Not a bad superhero movie at all!
B0000A1RJI|2.0|First of all...this score was definitely not just overproduced by Hans Zimmer...it was practically WRITTEN by him.  As one other reviewer already pointed out, some of the music is almost exactly the same as the battle music in gladiator...same style, orchestration, and feel.  (that music incidentally was almost completely &quot;borrowed&quot; from Gustav Holst's 'Mars'from 'The Planets')  Badelt has managed to create a catchy theme and has occasional moments of brooding, atmospheric music...but not a very impressive effort overall.  Much of the music isn't even performed by live musicians but rather by synthesizers.  Nearly all of the percussion is done on a computer, as are some of the brass instruments.  I find this very dissapointing coming from someone who is the student of a well recognized film composer who ought to respect the music enough to let it be played by PEOPLE, not machines.
0312263120|1.0|I greatly enjoyed Angels and Daemons and DaVinci code, but Digital<BR>Fortress was disappointing. Being well-versed into technology and<BR>cryptography, I found several errors in this book. Calling ZIP an<BR>&quot;encryption algorithm&quot;, for example, is not only wrong but misses the<BR>point. <br />The final moments of the book are completely laughable. The time is<BR>running out to find the &quot;kill-code&quot; and all these PhD and scientist in<BR>the room can't solve a simple riddle.<br />I certainly hope Dan Brown did more research in his latest books.
0385504209|1.0|Mr. Brown spends nearly the whole book just slamming the Vatican, the Pope(s) and especially Opus Dei. Then on the last few pages he sort of lets the Vatican off the hook, revealing how they were just being framed by the bad guy.<br /><br />Up front he lays out a statement of 'facts' and gives the reader the impression that, while the book is a fiction novel, the historical details are true.<br /><br />But at one point he states outright that on the famous Friday 13th, Oct. 1307 the Pope sent 'his army' to round up and kill all the Templars.<br /><br />Hmmmm. In 1307 the only 'army' the Pope could try to command in France was the Templars themselves. Maybe the Hospitallers and Tuetonic knights could have been available to some degree in France, but in much smaller numbers. Yet one order was not likely to raise a hand against the other.<br /><br />The fact is that the king of France, Phillipe Le Bel, hatched the entire plan and executed the whole business through his own seneschals. It did not go off quite as planned with only a relative handful of knights being arrested and many of those 'escaped' or were released. None of the portable wealth was confiscated, just real estate. The Pope's only complicity was in loosely worded Bulls charging heresy, which while unproven in the modern sense, there is a fair amount of evidence that the Templars were indeed a heretical order.<br />This book was a good reminder why I don't read fiction much anymore.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Interesting but rather bland and lifeless when compared to the original. Phil Spector knew what he was doing. &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot;, in particular sounds just plain awful. Even Gareth Gates and Will Young's version of the song is superior, and I mean that as a compliment. Their rendition of the Beatles' classic is beautiful and haunting. Get it, you don't kow what you're missing. But back to &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot;. The remaining Beatles should have left the original version alone. Mind you, it's still a very good album, but it pales to the original. Paul and Ringo, you should have indeed Let It Be!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are VERY few people who would not love this series, buy you copy today!!!
B00004ZAV3|1.0|I dont know what the huge deal is over the Beatles . The music is very yawnsome and they werent great singers.Comparing their composing to the likes of Mozart or Beethoven is absolutely laughable!!!.Their singing  comes nowhere close to people like Elvis Presley , Stevie Wonder ,Aretha Franklin or Tom jones .All these singers had a soulful quality to their voices that transcended the listener to musical bliss. The Beatles just dont do it for me in this regard. Sorry.This cd is overrated .
0385504209|1.0|What on earth are the critics raving about? Two-thirds of the book is copped directly from the references the author gives beginning Chapter 60. The other one-third is a weak attempt to merge mystery religion with what the author believes is a thriller. Anyone who has read even one of the four historical studies cited by the author knows all about Da Vinci's so-called checkered activities and his flakey antics such as backward writing and cryptograms. And to call the main character Sauniere is just ribald cartooning!<br />So, Mister Brown, I guess I missed something... In your opinion, what did happen to John the Baptizer?
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As said before here, my wife and I also sat through this film waiting for it to get started.... and then the credits rolled!  It was a very predictable movie.  I don't understand where all the media hype (nor Golden Globe awards) came from.  I can't fault the acting, but the film was only a bit of eye candy - the strangest part showing how different Japanese culture is from American culture.  (It convincined me that I don't think I could bear to live in a Japanese city.  Maybe the countryside, definitely not the city!)<br />Good effort by everyone - it just didn't gel for me.  I prefer movies with a plot (and a progressive plot at that), than a &quot;slice out of somebody's week&quot; genre.

0790734060|5.0|So far as I know, that was actually his name. 'Amadeus' seems to have originated from a letter in which he jokingly Latinised his first names, signing himself 'Wolfgangus Amadeus'.<br />He died aged 35, and I don't think that despite the copious contemporary material about him anyone really knows what he died of. If I followed this film rightly, it seems to come close to suggesting that he died of drink, or at least that that had a lot to do with it. Whatever -- this film is not a documentary or a scholarly biography but an imaginative reconstruction. It is told in flashbacks by the dying Salieri, official court composer but jealous of his divinely-gifted young rival. There has long been a suspicion that Salieri had some hand in Mozart's early death, and there is even an opera by Rimsky-Korsakov, which alas I do not know despite being a considerable enthusiast for that composer, that has that suspicion as its theme. I have no view of my own regarding the real facts of the matter, because such scholarship as I have read on the subject has been of the worst kind, attempting to settle issues by criticism of the moral attributes and attitudes, real or supposed, of other scholars. I should just take this film's version of the story as creative licence, based on incomplete and uncertain information much as Hamlet is on the historical story of Amled.<br />The main character is not Mozart himself but Salieri, played, in an imaginative piece of casting, by a Broadway and Shaftesbury Avenue actor F Murray Abraham. He is more or less beyond criticism, which is more likely to focus on the part of Mozart as done by Tom Hulce. Mozart is depicted as a crude little vulgarian with an excruciatingly awful laugh. He is shown as dominated by a possessive father, Leopold, hostile and bullying towards Mozart's wife Constanze. One of the most memorable vignettes in the film comes at a point where these two are at each other's throats and Mozart himself walks slowly out of the room looking as if he has seen a ghost -- the divine inspiration is suddenly on him.<br />The story of this film does not point any moral, to my great relief. I was brought up on a great deal of sentimental gush about the supposely unspeakable tragedy of a great composer buried in a communal grave -- as if that would have mattered to him by then. One would expect better than such suburbanity from Forman, and in its way this seems to me a really first class piece of imaginative entertainment, helped of course in no small way by some -- shall we say -- rather above-average music. The main setting, in Prague, does not hurt either. One thing we do know about Mozart was that he greatly preferred Prague to Vienna, and who, I wonder, wouldn't? I would not want to give Amadeus anything less than a five-star rating for what it is, while not for one moment trying to suggest that what it is is anything remotely of the class of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest from the same Director.g as if he has seen a ghost -- the divine inspiration is suddenly on him. <br />The story of this film does not point any moral, to my great relief.

B000002UB6|5.0|that fact was proven to me last night as I watched the grammys- this album has always been a underrated classic!
B0000C9JFO|3.0|I enjoyed this film- it was fast-paced, had interesting characters, and gave a unique twist to what could have been a stale/over-used plot. The main character's decision to live abroad for a year was less than adequately clear, as was his age intially. <br />I particularly enjoyed the various trials and tribulations of Xavier's roomates- the interesting/quirky characters thrown into the mix added a lot of humor and interest to this film.
0671027573|5.0|This book is so enjoyable to me that I just could not wait to write a review on it and I haven't even finished reading it.  The budding romance between Sam and Jaine is just downright adorable.  I love the way they bounce off and cut on each other throughout the entire book.  As far as the \\"List\\" is concerned, I feel like the author placed way too much emphasis on it.  I mean, really, how many times have we all made up lists of this sort? I feel that this was made way too big a deal out of.  It's just a list, for God's sake.  But the book was very enlightening.  It's a good break from constantly reading nothing but straight murder msytery which, mostly, is too serious and does not include enough laughs, if any.  <br />The entire cast of characters is hilarious, especially Corin himself.  Gosh, he really needs to be diagnosed!!! Jaine's girlfriends (Luna, Marcie, and TJ) reminded me of the sistergirl relationships that I had when I was younger.  There's nothing like Girl Time.  Although this is a thick book, it is a very fast and light read and will not take long to get through.  I feel that it is a good book for travel.
B00003CXCW|5.0|An aloof actress caught in the web of the past is suddenly brought to the present by a chance encounter with an out of talent writer. Through him she is made to face the hard facts of reality of a changed hollywood, an ageing self, and a romance that will never be. Unable to deal with these hard facts, her life quickly turns toward a climax of murder and madness.<br />Gloria Swanson's years of silent screen acting skills still resonates after years since silents went dead. Her facial expressions, sharp and bold moves, and pefect dialogue make her a fascinating character to watch.<br />William Holden plays the cynic and feels nothing in Hollywood is what it says it is or appears to be.<br />A terrific film that was brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder.
B0000CDL93|1.0|JFK, Oliver Stone's supposed masterpiece about the Kennedy assassination, probes the abyss of nonsensical conspiracy theory and never emerges from the black hole.  Forty years after one of the darkest days in US history, facts now show how poorly done Stone's movie was from a fact standpoint.  <br />In November of 2003, the week of the fortieth anniversary of Kennedy's death in Dallas, Peter Jennings tackled every pillar upon which Stone had based his arguments for conspiracy and totally wiped them out.  Oswald a poor shot? Nonsense! Oswald achieved marksman status in the US Marine Corps.  Not enough time to get off three shots? Rubbish! Jennings' report clearly demonstrates that three shots were more than doable.  The final fatal shot came from the front and right? Hardly! Never mind which way Kennedy's body falls in the Zapruder film.  Ballistics is the only science that can be trusted here, along with facts from Kennedy's autopsy. Autopsy X-rays of Kennedy's skull definitively show that the point of impact was from behind and above and not from the front.  The spot on the back of Kennedy's head could not have been hit by a shot from the grassy knoll unless conspiracy theorists are claiming a &quot;magic bullet&quot; of their own that hung in midair then turned sharply to the right in order to enter Kennedy's head from the proper trajectory.  <br />Pristine bullet? Magic bullet? Secret meetings with conspiratorial assassins? Jack Ruby working in a supposed conspiracy? Fiction!  Pure unadulterated fiction!  Stone's skills as a gifted moviemaker are there in JFK in rich abundance but he falls into the hole when it comes to history.<br />Douglas McAllister
B000002UUX|5.0|I bought this album about three years ago, i had heard megadeth a few times on the radio or in movies, but nothing could have prepared me for the sheer quality and class of this unbelievable record. I like Metallica as much as the next guy(pre 1994), but i heard critisism about megadeth for, you guessed it, Metallica fans, i believed them, but only because i liked Metallica, when i bought this record, i was amazed, i then came to the conclusion that the stories i heard were from Metallica fans, cautious of their mearest rivals, for over 15 years. Paranoid of Megadeths talent, i love Metallica, but everything Metallica does is bettered by Megadeth in this record, The guitar work is phenomenal, From dave mustaines killer riffs and fast, brilliant solos, marty friedmans umatchable talent on the guitar, bettering the great kirk hammet in every way(no offence, theyre both great), and there is no qustion that the drums by Nick Menza are vastly superior to lars' average but structured drums. The bass is about equal, only with Ellefson providing some song writing, now to the vocals, i know james is a good vocalist, but dave mustaine suits his style much better, but Dave Mustaines guitar work is much better than james', both frontmen write 95% of the songs.<BR>This album is phenomenal, and through it have bought all of the other megadeth albums, with the legendary Peace Sells But Whos Buying,(which possibly betters this great record).<BR>Every song is a solid 10/10, except dawn patrol with a 7.<BR>The stand out tracks are;<BR>Holy Wars<BR>Hanger 18<BR>Tornado of souls<BR>Lucretia<br />They are all great and this is the onlty band to better 'Tallica<BR>If you respect great musician ship and guitar solos to be set in stone, BUY THIS, MEGADETH RULE<br />you will not be dissapointed..
B000002UAC|5.0|It's been 40 years to the day that the Beatles made their historic appearance on the Ed Sullivan show, so it's only fitting that I choose this very special day to review the Beatles' second album, &quot;With The Beatles.&quot; Featuring 8 Beatles originals and 6 cover tunes, &quot;With The Beatles&quot; can be summed up in three words: fun, fun, FUN! The Fab Four's energy, and their wonderful musical &amp; vocal chemistry is very apparent on this album. No wonder America fell under the group's spell so quickly! Many Beatles classics are on this one: Lennon/McCartney's &quot;It Won't Be Long,&quot; &quot;All I've Got To Do,&quot; &quot;All My Loving,&quot; &quot;Little Child,&quot; &quot;Hold Me Tight,&quot; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; (with Ringo on lead vocals), and &quot;Not A Second Time.&quot; George Harrison makes his songwriting debut with his excellent number, &quot;Don't Bother Me.&quot; And the Beatles once again show their knack for covering other people's songs so brilliantly on the tracks &quot;'Til There Was You,&quot; &quot;Please Mister Postman,&quot; &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (with vocals by Harrison),&quot;You Really Got A Hold On Me,&quot; &quot;Devil In Her Heart,&quot; and the great rockin' rave-up, &quot;Money.&quot; &quot;With The Beatles&quot; is a Beatles classic that captures this beloved, pioneering group at the height of Beatlemania. So buy it, put it on, crank it up, and have your very own Beatles screamfest. Happy 40th, lads!
B00011RPB0|4.0|I absolutely adored this movie in theaters and it has become my most favorite film of all time.  Now I'm not goin to argue that it is the best film ever made...but it was at the least my PERSONAL favorite.  My only complaint with the actual dvd is the changes which have been made from the original; seemingly small yes, still, significant enough to catch my eye.  One of the most noticeable changes: the music in the very last scene is different...although they still used a song from the original soundtrack, it's a different one, and it makes an enormous difference in the mood of the conclusion... i guess this just goes to show how much of a difference music can make in storytelling. It seems to me they wanted to make the ending just slightly more optimistic... I guess I'm glad I saw this in theaters.
0609610570|5.0|This is an insightful, straight to the point and useful book.  A must for managers and executives!
B00005QB42|5.0|This CD was playing softly at workshop I did recently and the music coordinator jotted the name down on the back of my nametag.  When I got home and ordered it I was not prepared for the lush beauty and power of Deva and Miten.  I have since ordered every single one of Deva and Miten's CDs and they are ALL MAGNIFICANT.  Deva's soothing voice and the fantastic arrangements make this an amazing CD to play while loading the dishwasher, healing a client, AT WORK or as a meditation itself.  Recently myself and a group used her beautiful Gayatri Mantra in a world healing - and it was so powerful, we were all vibrating when we finished.  I cannot say enough about how powerful this CD is, and Deva's music is in my life.
B00005JM20|4.0|\\"Johnny English\\" is a surprisingly funny spy-spoof starring the hysterical British comedian Rowan Atkinson (aka Mr. Bean).  Being a fan of the British TV series \\"Bean\\", I was curious to see if Atkinson could break out of his role as the inherently childish Mr. Bean and carry an actual full-length film with his antics.  I'm happy to report that yes, indeed he can!  <br />Yes, the plot is stupid, but it provides Atkinson with plenty of opportunities to work his magic.  Unlike many \\"comedies\\" nowadays, most of the jokes in this film are actually FUNNY and don't cause you and your movie companion to look quizzically at each other, wondering whether or not THAT was actually supposed to be funny .  Some moments truly made me breakout into hysterical laughter.  Let's see, there's a tie getting caught in a sushi bar roll around, Johnny mistakenly taking the staff of a hospital hostage, the Archbishop of Canterbury's rear end being exposed on national TV, Johnny (again mistakenly) disrupting a funeral service and dancing atop a coffin which he believes contain the crown jewels, the French jokes...  And that's not all ;-)<br />If you're looking for a good time at the movies, or rather a family-friendlier version of Austin Powers, try \\"Johnny English\\".  It's relatively inoffensive, funny, and highly entertaining!
1577311523|5.0|I was given this book as a gift.  Once I started reading it I couldnt put it down. Whole lot of things to think about here
0061015725|3.0|This book had a great story and played up the intensity well, but what's up with all the heavy swearing, especially the f-bomb? As they say, profanity is used by those with a limited vocabulary. Truly great authors can come up with other words of expression to convey the emotion - e.g. Terry Brooks, Frederick Forsyth, Stephen Ambrose and others. Timeline had this same problem. Instead of adding to the story, the profanity detracts from it. Also, Crichton's conclusions are always too quick and don't explain enough, like when certain pivotal events happened.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|All of the other reviewers that gave this gem of a movie a one or two star rating.....must be the same ones that allow Hollywood to keep churning out these mindless movies that only have car chases, explosions and space monkeys. It's seems that the average American has the attention span of a grape.....and unless there is some flashy parts to a movie where things get &quot;blowed up&quot;......then folks aren't going to like it.<BR>This is a movie that makes you use your mind for a change, but in a very subtle way. Beautifully directed, photographed and acted.....it is deserving of all it's praise!!!! Sometimes people.........you have to just let the art FLOW OVER you. This is one of those times.........
B00003CXFU|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have watched it several times and enjoy it every time.  It is a movie about a very serious and true event that adds enough humor and comic touches throughout it to keep it interesting and entertaining.  <br />A down and out, twice divorced, single mother desperately looking for a job finally bullies her way into a job in a law office using the excuse that since her lawyer lost her injury case that he said she would win that he owed her.  <br />She ends up looking into some real estate files that have medical records attached to them and is confused.  As she delves deeper, she is shocked and horrified at finding that a major energy company has been dumping toxic chromium waste knowing that it is getting into the water system and making people sick, etc.  She convinces her boss to help the people by taking the matter to court.  Absolutely fascinating!<br />Her choice of clothes is not the demure business type but more on the floozy side.  The cast of characters are absolutely outstanding and work perfectly together.  I highly recommend the movie! Enjoy!
B0000C8AV2|4.0|Bob Dylan's first collaboration with producer Daniel Lanois isn't as strong as their second-go-round (the Grammy winning &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;) but it's a winner all the same. Lanois creates an aural landscape that brings out the best in some of the strongest songs Dylan wrote in the 80s.<br />From the opening track, &quot;Political World,&quot; you know Dylan has gotten back down to some serious business after the aimlessness of &quot;Knocked Out Loaded&quot; and &quot;Down in the Groove.&quot; He charges ahead with the even stronger &quot;Everything Is Broken&quot; and keeps the momentum going right through to the closing ballad, the beautiful &quot;Shooting Star,&quot; a heartbreaker whose lyrics make you wonder whom he is addressing (his late father, perhaps?)<br />Other highlights include &quot;Most of the Time,&quot; a winning ballad about love lost, and the epic &quot;Man in the Long Black Coat.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh Mercy&quot; represented a comeback of sorts. It reached number 30 on the Billboard album chart (Dylan's highest showing in six years), and earned a lot of critical praise. Unfortunately, it didn't have quite the impact it deserved, and it would be another eight years (!) before &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; reawakened the world to the news that Dylan was still a force to be reckoned with. Those of us who heard this album weren't so surprised.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is one independent film (and believe me their are great ones) that had no business entering the mainstream fray - especially Best Picture territory. All you art film institute &quot;types&quot; need to get off the valium and stuff this one back in to Cannes film festival and keep it there. The film goes absolutely no where and takes 90 minutes too long in trying to develop its characters. By the time Murray delivered any scenes worth chuckling about or the occasional dialog that even REMOTELY left you anticipating the next scene, I was already in desperate need of shock treatment. I don't care if Nicole Kidman looked like a post Cival War barbie doll in Cold Mountain - that film runs circles around Lost in Translation and deserves to take its place in the winners circle.
B000053VAF|5.0|If the use of any vulgar language bothers you, this is not the movie for you. If poking fun at religious dogma where religion-(not just Catholicism)-cannot defend itself, this is not the movie for you.<br />However, if you are open-minded enough to realize and accept that all points of view have merit, and can just enjoy a damn funny movie for its own sake, then this is definitely the movie for you!<br />The opening credits advise you to not take the movie seriously and it is your own fault if you do. This movie is crass, profane, and disturbing. It is thought provoking and deeper than it first seems. It is also one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Some people may see this movie and think Kevin Smith &amp; Company are ridiculing people of faith, if not faith itself. I think nothing could be further from the truth. This movie has the message that God does exist. In what form does God exist? Well that is the question. No religion is more right on than the next. The fundamentalists of every faith would definitely disagree.<br />There is no one &quot;right religion.&quot; But to use a line from Inherit the Wind: &quot;Right&quot; has no meaning whatsoever. But &quot;truth&quot; has meaning as a direction.<br />I am religious and I thought this movie was fantastic!
0380789019|4.0|Neil writes excellent fantasy and in this book he takes us to a city below a city. I love this idea and find it fascinating that such a world &quot;exists&quot; underneath. Characters Richard Mayhew, Hunter, the Marquis, and Door set off on a quest for information. Richard wants to restore his world to normalcy...but what really is normalcy? Can normalcy be so fulfilling? Richard will never be the same...and neither will you. I like this story where the homeless and underdwellers can be heroes...where rats are respected and are viewed as friends. <br />Refreshing and stimulating.
0385510438|5.0|The 1970s . . .a small town in the South is the setting for this latest Grisham novel. That, plus the colorful cast of eccentric characters might be dangerously cliched material in any other author's hands, but not in Grisham's.  This book is like a cross between &quot;A Painted House&quot; and some of his better known courtroom books. It's actually not so much a &quot;mystery&quot; as it is just a good story, interestingly told.  <br />Also recommended:  The Firm, Bark of the Dogwood, Capital Crimes
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice was first introduced to me through my mum. After reading the book I was delighted to discover the DVD existed, which I knew I definitely had to watch. The DVD was absolutely amazing; it brought each character to life as the cast portray the characters magnificently! Jennifer Ehle's acting was outstanding as Elizabeth Bennet and I grew to love her to bits.  Colin Firth was a brilliant Mr Darcy and he enabled me to understand the depth of Darcy's character. Alison Steadman played Mrs Bennet remarkably well. Mrs Bennet's character is at times trying, as she is so fickle, yet Alison Steadman brought life into the character and made me laugh many times. Over all I absolutely love the story. It seems to contain everything a good novel needs and I thank the people who brought this masterpiece to our screens.<BR>I often think films based on books miss the true meanings found in the book, however; this DVD captures everything that makes Pride and Prejudice a fantastic read today. It's a DVD that must be watched if you're a Jane Austin fan.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Unlike most people, this was my introduction to Nirvana. Granted, I'd heard their music before. (Everyone's heard &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot;) But, I didn't feel like buying all the albums (which is what I do when I want to know what a band sounds like... just buying Nevermind would've been a cop-out). Needless to say, I enjoyed this best of compilation. &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is probably the best non-album Nirvana song out there. Anyway, once you track down the other albums (which you MUST DO!), you'll see that - while it does collect all their singles and some of there other works - this CD does NOT encapsulate the spirit of Nirvana. Of course every fan would like thier own favorites to be put on (in my case, &quot;Negative Creep,&quot; &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot; or &quot;Francis Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle&quot;), the major reason this doesn't get a 5 in my book is that it makes Nirvana out to be (albeit a very insightful and introspective) grunge band. And, though it does fall under that banner, Nirvana is also very much a punky/punk-inspired band. Bleech illustrates the hardcore influences, while Incesticide showcases their pop-punk roots. Anyway, I think this CD is a little short-sighted. And, if they wanted to include a cover, they shouldn't have chosen one just because its by the most recognizeable artist (Bowie is great, though). (Again, I would've chosen one of the Meat Puppets' covers, but... such is life). Good CD. Great band. Buy the full discography.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|This disc is easily one of the BEST cd Iron Maiden has ever done. Everything any Maiden fan is looking for is there: kick ass guitar, multiple time changes in almost every song, powerful story telling, awesome vocals, one of a kind bass playing (of course), and drumming only like Nicko can do! If your looking ONLY for a &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; sound; you'll be disappointed. If your looking for ONLY an early Iron Maiden sound; you'll be disappointed. This disc has an early Maiden sound, an 80's, 90's and Brave New World sound! This dics is easily one of the BEST Iron Maiden cds EVER; it has it all! I would also highly recommended buying Maiden's &quot;Rock in Rio&quot; dvd, then watch any &quot;new&quot; metal dvd's and compare. You'll soon realize there is no comparison; MAIDEN RULES! Always have, always will!
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Resurfacing after a seven year absence, Sarah McLachlan returns with this album and she has a lot to prove.  Afterglow's predecessor, Surfacing, is arguably one of the best ballad albums of all-time. She managed to conquer a fandom so diverse with her last release that Afterglow is going to be under much scrutiny.<br />McLachlan has managed to deliver hushed melodies that prove her artistic supremacy. From the wonderfully scratchy \\"Into the Fire,\\" or the monumentally nostalgic \\"Path of Thorns (Terms of Endearment),\\" she has managed to carve out lo-tempo melodies with subtle yet weighty melodies.<br />This time around, McLachlan doesn't stray too far away from her origin.  The songs remain wonderfully structured, as with \\"Stupid,\\" where she manages to unleash her anger with grace, and the lead single \\"Fallen.\\"<br />The album does not settle with a number of hits.  However, it does settle for the same monotone distinction that is evident on all of McLachlan's previous albums.<br />\\"Train Wreck\\" is laced with dubbed vocalization and wise lyrics, while \\"Push\\" is set to capture everyone's heart with its simplistic approach, much like \\"Angel.\\"<br />The album does not experiment with anything new and sticks to the Surfacing template, which is demonstrated in \\"Answer\\" and the haunting \\"Dirty Little Secret.\\"<br />McLachlan fans will be please and it will surely bring in a couple more fans. Afterglow is another dark tour de force from McLachlan's impressive catalogue.
B000089RVR|4.0|I bought this CD for my wife, and now I am fascinated by it. You could say she put her feelings into her voice and into the lyrics.
B00006690G|1.0|O.K. to start out with this CD has horrible songs in some songs there just playing a rock song as eminem raps to it with lyrics that are not good and possibly just for shock value. Its the same thing as all the other cd's when the first came out they were different and many people liked them but now its the same songs almost with a incredible amount of curseing. It wont surprise me to see his next album say &quot;Now with 40% more bad language FREE!&quot; His songs lack any writeing talent. His main audience is white kids from like 13-20. Theres so many other rap artists better than him. Although all rap has bad lyrics his are perticullary bad talking about how he hates his wife and how he hates certain races etc. This cd is a embarrasment to music.
B000001E21|4.0|While Def Leppard had an an &quot;official&quot; album a year earlier, Adrenalise, it was lacking they very important songwriting influence of Steve Clark due to his passing a year earlier, and as a result the focus was lacking, and also the result was dramatically overproduced.<br />  While these were outakes and unfinshed tracks, the results here were dramatically differnt. Here Clarks influence in songwriting and his actual guitar tracks were present. Also, the production here was their most stripped down since High and Dry, the result is a solid album full of rockers and a couple of high quality ballads.<br />  Not to say the album doesnt have a couple of duds, such as the cover of Mick Ronsons Only After Dark, plus the electric versions of Miss you in a heartbeat and Two steps behind, but otherwise this is a top shelf effort. The real shame here is this album was not released 3 or even 2 years earlier than it was, it would have topped the charts for months and sold millions of copies, but it came out in 93, 2 years after Nirvana hit. None the less any fan of 80s style hard rock, a era that emerged with Van Halens debut in 78 should get this CD, it was a fun 15 years, and this album is a fitting end.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" may be the most sophisticated American movie of 2003. It may also be the best. It is the kind of movie whose hierarchy in cinema history will be decided years from now. One thing that it is not is `mainstream'. Some viewers will be spellbound by it. Others will come away wondering why they wasted their time. <br />Part of the `problem' is that the story is like a minimalist painting - the viewer must fill in much of the details. A famous Hollywood star, Bob Harris [Bill Murray], travels to Tokyo to do some commercials for a Japanese whiskey manufacturer. All those time zones he has traveled through give him insomnia. Already ensconced at Bob's posh hotel is a young woman, Charlotte [Scarlett Johansson], who has traveled there with her husband [Giovanni Ribisi], a famous photographer. The husband must travel around Japan on assignment, leaving Charlotte on her own in Tokyo. Bob and Charlotte meet and have an affair which is far more spiritual than physical. When Bob's time in Japan is up, they both move on. <br />There is no raging sexual affair here. There is no moaning about how `bad' Bob and Charlotte's spouses are. [Bob's wife is back in California.] Both will return to the lives they have been living, albeit positively changed. To me, \\"Lost in Translation\\" is about those people we meet who profoundly change our lives, no matter how brief the encounter may be.
B000063DFS|5.0|I'll admit that I am a newcomer to the world of Ozzy Osbourne and didn't know what to expect before listening to this album. Let me tell you, I was completely blown away by the amount of quality and  depth this album offers. The song writing is excellent and each song follows through into the next in pefect fashion. Tracks that deserve top honors include, Mr. Tinkertrain, I don't want to Change the World, Ma Ma I'm comin' home,  No More Tears, Desire, SIN, Hellraiser and the Road to Nowhere, which pretty much summarizes Ozzy's career. A good follow up album to this which I'm listening to now is Ozzman Cometh which contains many of Ozzy's most popular tracks such as Mr. Crowely and Bark at the Moon. <br />This album is a definite must for Ozzy fans but then again if you already have the Essential Ozzy osbourne then you don't need this. Still I hear this album is much better as the essential version has been remastered which make the songs sound even worse.
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code is a fast paced, fun thriller that was most definitely designed for the silver screen.  It is crystal clear that Dan Brown seemed to have movie in mind as he wrote the book.  Marked by very short chapter lengths of 1-5 pages, the story moves out quickly and seems ready made for movie adaptation.  I did find the short chapters to be tiresome.  The plotline, putting aside the unique angle of the Holy Grail, is cookie cutter.  Character development is one-dimensional and predictable.<br />It is worth saying that there is a lot of hype about this book because the tale of the Holy Grail was weaved into it.  There is nothing new or earth shattering in what the author presents on the Holy Grail, Knights Templar, or Mary Magdalene.  Dan Brown breaks no new ground on the religious and historical fronts.  But he does a fair job of mining existing works on the Holy Grail in producing this book.<br />There are those in Christian circles who are concerned with this book because it purports that Jesus married Mary Magdalene and produced offspring (and that there are direct descendants living among us even today) among the many heretical topics presented in the book.  Those in certain Christian circles are worried that the many readers who are not familiar with Grail mythology might question their faith as a result of being exposed to these ideas.  These ideas are nothing new.  Why try to run away from them or discourage others to not read it?  My retort is simple.  If ideas contrary to your beliefs or understanding of your faith's pillars threaten your faith, you may not have a true faith.
0385510438|5.0|This is one of his better books, and I was sad to see it end...it definitely needs a sequel.  It has been a while since he wrote a book where you truly cared about the characters.  This is a must read for Grisham devotees.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Only a musical idiot could fail to recognize the significance of this incredible string of hit songs.  For those who weren't there at the time you must take into consideration that NO ONE was making this kind of music in America.  It was a new sound, a new look, a new attitude and it blew through the country's youth like a refreshing storm.  If you don't take into consideration those factors then these songs (expecially the early ones) can sound simple and silly.  But that would just as aptly apply to the Stones, Beach Boys, The Who, etc.  The thing I like most about this collection is that I can hear the evolution of their songwriting, musicianship and production in a very consise form.  It's also remarkable how everything changes after John sings for &quot;Help.&quot;  No matter what perceived flaws it may include, it's a fun ride for the ears.
B00013PHGS|5.0|This album by the French chillout duo is not only the best of 2004 so far, but also more than just a great comeback after the rather odd '10,000 Hz' album. Air has once more steered the chillout/lounge boat into a new direction. With a sound that borrows from the &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; album here and there (no coincidence that the last track, &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; was used by the movie's director Sofia Coppola in the soundtrack for her latest movie, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;), Air's music sound better than ever.<br />This time around, uber-producer Nigel Godrich (Radiohead, Travis, Beck, etc.) co-produced and mixed the album, which largely accounts for its sound that blends a bit of spacey and happy, balanced out against some darker and downbeat sounds. Overall, the album tranports you with its varied atmospheres since the very opening well into tracks such as &quot;Run&quot;, &quot;Universal Traveler&quot; (my favorite), &quot;Surfing on a Rocket&quot; and &quot;Another Day&quot;. Well over a week ago, I popped it into my CD player... so far, it's managed to stay in all this time. Highly recommended, great piece of work, very fun and interesting to listen to.
0345457684|4.0|The hook of this novel, the ability to transport a neural &quot;stack&quot; that holds your consciousness into a refrigerated human &quot;sleeve&quot;, is absolutely brilliant.  Takeshi Kovacs, a disgraced special ops warfare officer, is transmitted from his colony world to Earth to solve an apparent murder.  In a world where wealthy methusalahs cannot die, what is the point of killing the Bay Area's wealthiest man?  From self aware hotels to designer drugs and psionic pop-up ads, the texture of this book kept me engrossed.  To discuss more of the plot would ruin it, but this is a great future noir novel, and I do recommend it.
B00008DDSC|4.0|&quot;Secretary&quot; is a deliciously off-beat dramedy about an emotionally disturbed young girl (Maggie Gyllenhaal) who gets a job as a you know what for an attorney with his own set of personal problems (James Spader). Soon, she's doing more than typing for him, and he's helping her come out of her reclusive shell.<br />This film on paper sounds almost exactly like &quot;The Piano.&quot; A young woman is given the choice between a conventional relationship and one that superficially might seem perverse, and opts for the perverse one. In both films, what no-one in the heroine's sphere understands is that the man she's involved with is appealing because he's the only one who seems to understand what she needs.<br />&quot;Secretary&quot; is not as sombre as &quot;The Piano,&quot; however, though it's not as rowdy as the premise might lead you to believe.  It's actually a quite substantive film and only occasionally did I think it faltered somewhat in telling its story (particularly toward the end, when Lee embarks upon her hunger strike).  Ironically, in offering herself up for submissive humiliation from her boss, Lee finds the strength she needs to face her own demons and forges a confidence she's never before had.<br />Gyllenhall is spectacular, and gives one of those performances that should put her on the map as a serious actress, if anyone is paying attention.  Spader is pretty good too, but he's upstaged by Gyllenhaal, who owns this movie.<br />Grade: A-
B000001F9N|5.0|Like &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;, &quot;A Love Trilogy&quot; has another 17-minute memorable song &quot;Try Me, I Know, We Can Make It&quot;. The track is not as orgasmic as &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;, but it is still enjoyable.  If there were any doubts about her singing ability, it was put to rest by &quot;Could It Be Magic&quot; along with the one-minute prelude.  That song was previously performed by none other than Barry Manilow!<br />All Donna Summer fans should have this album.  It may be hard to find it online, but you may be able to find it in a music store that specializes in Dance/ R &amp; B.

All the recipes I have used so far have turned out perfect.  Plus it is so diverse and thorough... I think it is the best all around fundamentally sound cookbook out there.<BR>Chef recommended
0671027387|3.0|As a simple thriller, this book is entertaining.  The plot moves along briskly and the author does a nice job of breaking the story up into nice, digestible chunks.  However, as someone who knows a bit about NASA, it was clear to me that Dan Brown kind of phoned in that aspect of his research.  Oh, sure, he threw in some convincing acronyms and mentioned a few real programs, but many of the &quot;facts&quot; about NASA's organization and programs which were used as critical plot points were just plain wrong.  So, if you read this book, pretend that NASA stands for &quot;Not the American Space Agency&quot; and enjoy.
0156027321|4.0|Like a M. Night Shyamalan movie, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; reveals its secret in the very ending but don't worry, the novel doesn't rely solely on its conclusive revelation (which, by the way, you can either believe or not)!<br />Basically &quot;life of Pi&quot; is the tale of Pi Patel, a 16-year-old Indian boy who is shipwrecked in the Pacific and manages to survive for 227 days, all of this in the troublesome company of a 450-pound Royal Bengal tiger named Richard Parker.<br />Soon he realizes that the only way to prevent Richard Parker from attacking, is to tame him (being the son of a zookeeper Pi is somewhat advantaged in this). There is a wealth of research behind this novel, mostly zoological and botanical (in the midst of his drifting across the ocean the lifeboat bumbs into an island that eventually turns out to be something else, adding a further sprinkle of magic realism to the novel).<br />I found this novel greatly enjoyable and well written (it won the Booker after all) and I practically devoured the last part, starting with the discovery of the inslan onwards, till it's final, upsetting, ending.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I just watched this last night on the cable premiere, &amp; was surprised because it wasn't exactly like I expected.  First of all, like some have mentioned, it is very dark (maybe that's what I liked about it).... the background itself, &amp; the subject matter.  I'm not familiar with the comic book, so this is totally based on viewing the movie.  It's certainly not as happy-go-lucky as Spiderman, so if you're expecting that, it might disappoint.  There are some rather sad things that happen in the movie, but afterwards, I'm thinking, well, I did keep watching it.... &amp; even though most people like &amp; expect happy endings, the fact is that life is not full of them.  You can actually feel the pain of the characters... so in that respect, I didn't mind so much that it didn't have a totally happy &amp; predictable ending.  The visual effects are cool of course, &amp; the music is good too.<br />As far as the acting, I don't think you have to be a huge Ben Affleck fan to appreciate it... I'm saying that cuz yah, I'm REALLY sick of the whole J-Lo thing, but don't let that keep you from seeing him act.  He's not bad... I've only seen him in Kevin Smith movies like Dogma, so it was nice to see him do another character.  And speaking of Dogma, it's interesting that Kevin Smith was involved in this... I'm sure that contributed to my appreciation for this film.  I haven't even seen Garner &amp; Farrell at work, &amp; I think they both did a good job too.  They made Garner look really lovely, &amp; I thought her outfit she wore on the cover/fight was really cool.  Farrell was a really good villain, &amp; he fit the part almost too well.<br />A few downsides:  yah, the playground scene was kinda too Matrix-ish like someone said, but I think it can be overlooked.  And like I said earlier, some of the events that are down right sad might be aggravating to some cuz sometimes they were a little drawn out...even I was thinking at times &quot;geez, could his luck get any worse?&quot;  But it kinda reminds me of listening to depressing music, as I often do...if you don't mind the reality of it, it might actually make you feel better... or maybe I'm just weird like that.  All in all, I actually agree with the reviewer rating here of 3 &amp; 1/2 stars, but since I had to pick, I give it a 4... just going with the majority, &amp; I'm in a good mood.  If you like other super-hero/vigilante movies like Batman, Spiderman, &amp; The Crow, you'll be able to appreciate this as well.  I love fantasy/action movies like this, so I would definitely see this again.  Cheers.?&quot;  But it kinda reminds me of listening to depressing music, as I often do...if you don't mind the reality of it, it might actually make you feel better... or maybe I'm just weird like that.

0385336942|5.0|It's refreshing to read a first novel by an author who isn't trapped in his own insular world. This isn't yet another novel about a confused twentysomething trying to make it in the big city. It's a big, brainy, heartfelt novel, set during World War II, that is unashamedly exciting and fun to read. Big ups to Liam Callanan.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|It is entirely possible that this album caused me more worry than any other album in history. From the beginning (the beginning, in this case, being about a month before its release) I heard that ToT would have a more Metallican edge, with less progginess. This worried me. I like Metallica... but they are not my beloved Dream Theater, and DT is not Metallica. Not to mention Metallica hasn't been up to their old standards for, oh, 8 years now. This one had me shaking in my boots. I feared for the future of my all-time favorite band.<br />On paper, this one has the makings of an album in the tradition of \\"Awake\\"-it features dark themes, heavy riffs, a long instrumental track, sound clips from movies, and controversy. But although this is not \\"Awake\\" in any way, shape or form, it is still not a major departure overall from the band's style. They do some experimenting on a few tracks, but it's still Dream Theater.<br />IMO this album should have been called &quot;7 Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;-one degree for each track. My first experience with ToT was &quot;As I Am&quot;, which I heard on the radio. I hope never to hear it again. When I bought the album I skipped it every time. I have never listened to it once. Don't remind me that DT made that song. <br />But getting past that, the album got better. \\"This Dying Soul\\" is a continuation of \\"The Glass Prison\\" with some \\"Mirror\\" thrown in, and is decent overall; it's not as memorable as either of the originals, but it's still good lyrically.<br />\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" also had me worried, but it has become one of my favorites from the album. It's a sad yet passionate song with some good solos. Musically it reminds me of \\"Misunderstood\\", but lyrically very different. If the song means what I think it means, it is proof that rockers both have families and love them. Good for you, DT. <br />\\"Honor thy Father\\" starts out good and goes downhill beginning with when LaBrie starts rapping. The lyrics are raw, angry, emotional,and... not very clever. \\"Blaming everyone for all that you've done wrong/ I'll get my peace of mind when you hear this song...\\" I almost cried when I read that in the lyrics pamphlet. I hope this does not represent a \\"new direction\\" for DT. I have always admired their abilities to blend musical styles; but this is not blending, this is conforming. Stop it. Nu-metal is not music. Rap is not rock.<br />\\"Vacant\\" is slow and touching, reminding me of a short version of \\"Disappear\\" from 6DOIT. It fades into the aptly named \\"Stream of Consciousness\\", the obligatory instrumental track, which, despite some rambling, is becoming one of my favorites.<br />The entire album is redeemed, however, by \\"In The Name of God\\". This one is a classic in the old traditions of DT, reminding me of a cross between SFAM and 6DOIT. It has some of the best music on the entire disc, and, despite being the longest track, features the most variety. This is the one I will find myself coming back to most.<br />Is it worth the 15 bucks? Yes. Buy this album, but don't be fooled into thinking it is a \\"new direction\\" for DT. It has some experimentation, but every album does this to some degree. Buy it, enjoy the good moments, and file the bad ones away under \\"The Time DT Forgot Who They Were\\".

B0000C9JFO|5.0|Xavier is a economics student that receives guidance in regards to his education from a friend of the family and is steered in the direction of Spain's economy.  As a result he contacts Erasmus, a European wide student organization, to study in Barcelona, Spain.  However, it creates a predicament for Xavier as he must leave his beloved girlfriend Martine in Paris, which saddens him.  In tears Xavier spreads his wings as he leaves home for the first time and he finds himself homeless in Barcelona.  After many troubles he finally finds an apartment that he must share with a group of foreign students from all over Europe.  This is the beginning for a warm and friendly comedy about the difficulty a person can encounter as he or she leaves his or her place of origin.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This should be the model for all concert DVD's. Disc two contains the theatrical version while disc one has the complete show from beginning to end. As much as I love \\"Back In The U.S,\\" I wish they had packaged it in this manner.  The audio and video are simply superb, couldn't have been better. The packaging is great, with the tri-fold containing the discs and booklet inside a sleeve.  I can think of only one drawback to the DVD. It would have been nice to have included a biography of all the onstage performers from the concert. There are so many that I'm not familiar with.  The show was taped in the 133 year old Royal Albert Hall in London on the first anniversary of George's death, November 29, 2002.  The concert opens with Olivia lighting candles and then Eric Clapton walks out, speaks briefly, then introduces Ravi Shankar, who says a few words.   Anoushka Shankar(Ravi's daughter and the half-sister of Norah Jones) plays an 8 minute piece on the sitar. I enjoy Indian music and she is as beautiful as she is talented. Then she and others accompany Jeff Lynne on \\"The Inner Light.\\" I particularly enjoy this number. This is followed by a long piece written by Ravi, called \\"Arpan.\\" He wrote this in tribute to George and both the Indian and Western orchestras play on it. Eric Clapton joins in late on the acoustic guitar. There are moments that I enjoy but overall, I didn't care for this number.   I don't care for the next segment at all.I've never cared for Monty Python and their contribution to the show was boring and vulgar, as usual. BTW, although it isn't mentioned to the audience, Tom Hanks is part of their act.  Next, the Pop music portion opens with ''I Want to Tell You.'' The instrumentation and vocals are great on this tune.   A few highlights  from this segment would be.....\\"Here Comes The Sun\\"-Joe Brown\\"Horse To The Water''-Sam Brown(Joe's daughter)\\"Taxman\\"-Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers\\"Honey Don't\\"-Ringo\\"For You Blue\\"-Paul McCartney\\"Something\\"-It's great when the Clapper and Macca do a brief duet on this one.\\"My Sweet Lord\\"-Billy Preston    This track is simply awesome. Billy sings better than ever. As a Christian, I can't agree with the Hindu aspects of this tune, but I must admit the melody is beautiful.\\"Wah Wah\\"-Everybody plays on this, but the primary vocal is done by Jeff Lynne, who does a great job.\\"I'll See You In My Dreams\\"-Joe Brown is incredible on this old standard. It's very poignant as the confetti falls and the camera switches to a giant photo in the arena of a young George holding a guitar.  Eric Clapton is great as the emcee, but I only wish that Paul and Ringo had played a bigger part in the show. It would also have been great if George Martin and Pattie could have been there and maybe said a few words.   It's really eerie seeing George's son, Dhani onstage playing the guitar. He has a strong resemblance to his father.  I recommend this excellent DVD to any Beatles or George fan. I guarantee, you will watch it again and again and........
B000001XN2|4.0|This is a fantastic Trovatore, my favourite after the performance with Callas and Lauri Volpi. (Live, 1951) But as great as this recordings is, these reviews aren't great. I want to correct the most atrocious mistakes. Several persons don't even know how to spell this opera. It's &quot;Il Trovatore&quot; not Travatore. And the heroine is called Leonora and not Elvira. <br />&quot;Her trills is gorgeous in her second big aria. And lo and behold she sticks a high D that shames every singer alive at that time. I know she's a great Verdi singer. But I didn't know how great she was until this. The voice is sublime. It puts Caballe and Tebaldi and Callas to shame. And I'm a fan of those divas.&quot; <br />As lovely as all her singing is, it's just her trill that is flawed because it's shaky and unstable. That aside Price sounds FANTASTIC. Also, Callas sang E-flats and Ds as Leonora in her live-recordings from 1950-1951. <br />To sum it up: Excellent singing from Price&amp;Corelli under the baton of the exquisite von Karajan. Two thumbs up!!!!!! A++++++++++++++++
B00008PW2E|5.0|Please, please, please release this dvd soon!  This is one of the best shows on tv, yet the second season is still not out.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|We just returned to the States after living in Seoul and Taegu in South Korea for four years.<br />We thought the movie was pretty good, especially the parts about miscommunication.  My wife undertands Japanese and I think that made the movie even funnier for her.  The part where they are in the hospital and Morris is talking to the old man/woman was very funny, especially the reactions of the two women in the background.<br />For those that have lived overseas, especially Asia, they will &quot;get&quot; this movie.<br />There was a previous comment where someone's opinion was the movie was racist.  Far from it; it is just a slice of life and it pretty accurate at that.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation unfolds a brilliant story in regards to disconnection and connection in an unfamiliar milieu.  Bob Harris (Bill Murray), an American film celebrity suffering from a mid-life crisis, is is shooting a Whiskey commercial in Tokyo, Japan with people he barely can understand even with a translator.  Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), a recent Yale graduate in philosophy, is isolated by her husband John (Giovanni Ribisi) as he is constantly away on photo shoots.  In her seclusion she begins to question her life and her place in the world as she is detached from people she can communicate with.  Bob's and Charlotte's crisis is accentuated by jet-lag and insomnia which draws them to the hotel bar where their paths intersect and lead to a week long beginning for both of them to reconnect with life and their existence.  Sophia Coppola proves that she understands the human psyche and social interaction as she creates an authentic humane atmosphere that is enhanced by a terrific cinematography and a virtuoso performance by the cast as human existence is analyzed.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This movie was terrible.  I bought it based on it's rave reviews and I thought it was supposed to be funny.  Every scene was more boring than the previous.  This is the last time I buy a movie based on critics' reviews without actually seeing the movie.  It's too bad b/c i really like Bill Murray, but this was not one of the highlights of his career, I don't care what people say.
B0000UJL96|5.0|First the DVD review: The very first thing you need to know is your DVD will NOT come with a booklet. Nope, not even a chapter list. So don't bug Amazon about it. Go to the Paramount website and cry to them. But, both discs are excellent! Disc One has a crisp, clear picture with incredible sound and features commentary by the awesome/quirky Director/writer Nicholas Meyer. Disc One also has a text commentary. Disc Two is loaded with goodies but are lacking special effects features. Disc Two has some featurettes, including one that draws the parallel between the end of the Cold War and this stories premise. But my favorite thing about Disc Two is the tribute to DeForest Kelley. If you own all of the other Original Cast special edition DVD's then you know alot has been said about the \\"triangle\\" of the Kirk, Spock, and McCoy characters that is the essence of ST. Future encarnations of ST (TNG, Voyager, and that new show nobody watches) have tried (poorly) to give us new captains and Vulcans but no show or writer could ever replace Bones and that is thanks to the awesome DeForest Kelley! Thank you, DeForest, we will miss you and see you later:)<br />Nicholas Meyer, a man who never knew anything about the ST universe before signing on to direct ST II, has given so much to this franchise. He is one of the main reasons why this franchise is so successful today. He co-wrote ST II and IV, which is largely viewed as the fan favorites, and gave creative input on ST III. He is responsible for the new \\"look\\" and vision of all of the original cast movies except TMP and V. And he is a very quirky guy! I love listening to his commentaries on ST II and this movie. You have to hear for yourself to really understand (so buy this now!) but the way he describes things is great!<br />What's not to love about this movie? The premise is simple: It's a basic \\"Whodunit\\". Who killed the Klingon Chancellor and why? This is a very original storyline as well, which is always a plus! Of the 6 original cast movies only TMP, V, and VI have truly original storylines. (click on my name and read my other ST reviews to see more on originality.)<br />I am a HUGE fan of the original cast. They laid the foundation for everything that is ST today. Everything else is recycled and does not match the chemistry of this cast. But, if this has to be the final frontier for this cast..then it is an excellent send off! Shatner, who is always awesome in everything he does, gives us the best of Kirk! Fighting, kissing alien babes, and strategic decision making! Great stuff that no other captain in the ST universe can even touch. Of course Nimoy gives us another awesome Spock performance and DeForest rounds off the \\"triangle\\" by giving the best McCoy performance to date! <br />This movie is PACKED with great performances and cameos. Christopher Plummers General Chang is an instant classic bad guy. (\\"Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war!\\") Kim Cattrall (post Mannequin and pre Sex in the City!) plays the Vulcan Lt. Valeris. It's been difficult for the ladies to pull off the Vulcan persona, but she does a fine job. Super model Iman is great as the shape shifting alien Martia. There is a great cameo by Christian Slater, which if you blink you'll miss it, and a gratuitous cameo by TNG cast member Michael Dorn as \\"Worfs great granpa\\". (Yeah, I know, woop-dee-doo.)<br />A note about the Klingons. I don't know about other fans but my personal favorite bad guys have always been (and will always be) the Klingons. You can have your Borg's and Species 867-5309 or whatever, both are cool concepts but lack the essence of the bad guy persona a Klingon brings. They are the humans Yang to our Yin! They are bent on dominating the universe and match our technology and then some. So to see them kind of trivialized in this movie and weak is the only drawback to this awesome movie. I'll take Commander Kruge (ST III played by Christopher Lloyd) and General Chang over ANY bad guy TNG or Voyager can come up with! I would also take the Klingon Battle Cruiser and Bird of Prey over ANY ship in the ST universe!<br />The special effects are awesome considering the shoestring budget they had to work with. Paramount has given us some classic, CLASSIC movies like the Indiana Jones series. But they are notorious for taking Star Trek for granted. They are living off of this franchise right now as we speak. But getting money for the original cast ST movies has always been like pulling teeth. Why? Starting with ST The Motion Picture (when Michael Eisner was running Paramount, a man who is slowly and methodically destroying Disney right before our very eyes) on through to ST VI Paramount has lacked WAY behind in backing their cash cow. But that is typical for Hollywood Studios and Hollywood suits. All they wanna know is how little can we spend and how much will we make?<br />Lastly, I don't know about you, but I wish there would have been more original cast movies! I think the original cast had gotten to a point where they were no longer concerned with type casting and accepted the fact that we love them as the crew of the Enterprise. To this day I would go see an original cast movie! I don't care if they are floating around on galactic wheelchairs! I'll even help write the movie. How about this: Since ST likes to deal with issues that are relevant to our times, how about a RENEGADE President of the Federation who wages war without the backing of its people, sending young cadets to do his bidding, a Federation corrupted with greed, and the cast has to stop him? Yeah! Sounds good to me!
B000002KLZ|5.0|I can't say that I've ever listened to this album, really, or even a whole side of it, so take the 5-star rating with a grain of salt, but I've listened to &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; about a thousand times, mostly late at night, alone in my room with the lights out. It's not just the vocals, which are amazing, but also the guitar.  This is what a live performance is supposed to be, a well-rehearsed, talented band finding their groove and channeling inspiration down from that place where music resides.  I admit I was 18 years when I did it--but 20 years later the memory has never left me.<br />It's pretty rare that a live version of a song surpasses the studio version in all ways, but this is it.  After you've listetened to the live version for the tenth time in a row, look for the studio version and play that, just for a giggle.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|As a military member that just got stationed in japan i can say that the movie depicts the honest thoughts of an american in a different culture. This movie contains nothing racist. Americans and not used to pornography within a childs grasp or small showers and the loud in your face television shows. If you take anyone out of one environment they are going to find little intricacies that seem odd and out of place to you, this movie just depicts that. For the story i just didnt buy it, not to mention these are two married people having affairs its just plain wrong. but i the end has a few funny parts and Bill Murray is perfect for this roll. But this is definetly a rent not a buy.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I was reading reviews for this album and couldn't notice how inane some of the comments were:<br />Point 1: &quot;They sold out&quot;<br />  Say they did sell out by making this album and they wanted the money. Why would they do that? They all have more money than we can imagine so selling out would serve no purpose.<br />Point 2: &quot;They're not political anymore&quot;<br />  They're also not Rage Against The Machine anymore. Rage was a very political band, very liberal, which is what alot of people liked about them. People complain that Audioslave isn't, and that Tom, in particular, turned his back on his views for money. Look at it like this, you sleep right? Do you sleep all the time? No. Tom doesn't have to eat, sleep, and live political all the time. Being libeal is about being open minded. If you liked Rage because they were liberal, wouldn't you be open to change. Apparently not. I'm more conservative than liberal and I still love both bands.<br />  This is a very solid album, both musicaly and lyrically. Agreeably some tracks are better than others, but this is true with any album. In particular, &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Light My Way&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; are shining tracks. <br />  What we have learned today is that people who think they know what they are talking about really just end up looking like jacka**es. I.E. &quot;this almub suks. its all krap. not buy it&quot;
B000001ESP|5.0|In 1981 Rush had thousands of fans all over the world and had recorded at least 3 excellent and definitive albums in rock'n roll history. They're song had evolved extraordinary well in the previous years and, from album to album, we could see a great band of great musicians growing and reaching a very high level between the masters of rock. In the last 3 albums the band started using some synthesizers, instrument that became a mania in the 80's. This additional instrument bring some new colors and textures to the band's songs, featuring the obvious evolution of Neil Peart's lyrics and the development of Geddy Lee's vocals technique. The band performance at this time was just impecable ! So, after the big success of &quot;The spirit of radio&quot; and &quot;Freewill&quot; the band reached radio audiences and spread they're exciting hard-progressive rock among many teenagers and adults hungry for complex but still accessible rock. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; summarized all these things and is, undoubtly, Rush finest moment in all these years. The album has a strong production, with a very clean sound. Each instrument is perfectly audible. The tracks are shorten, even very well played. Compared to the previous albums, the songs have a pop-oriented appeal, but what we really see are eight tracks of pure and energetic hard rock mixed with synthesized-progressive pop ! The definition may sound strange, but you will understand everything at the first listen to the first track: &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot;, the major hit of the band. A compact song featuring dense futuristic lyrics, strong drumming, bass and guitar. Each instrument show some incredible virtuosism in just 4 minutes and a half! A classic. &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; is a delightful hard rock. You can see yourself driving faster trough the country road, reaching the skies, feeling the air in you hair... Excellent lyrics, excellent performance. Another major hit! &quot;YYZ&quot; is Rush's second best instrumental trackever (the big one is &quot;La villa strangiato&quot;). A hard progressive track with some high quality drumming and riffs. Lee, Lifeson and Peart are perfect! The synthesizer used in the middle of the track bring us a futuristic mood that really rocks! &quot;Limelight&quot; is another major hit. Like &quot;Red Barchetta&quot;, a track to shake our heads and sing all night long. Strong musicianship and lyrics. The guitar solo is heavenly well played! (and are even better live!). These four tracks are among best Rush's tracks of all times ! &quot;Camera eye&quot; is the last lenghty Rush track in their career. Ten minutes and a half of synth-progressive rock that works very well. &quot;Witch Hunt&quot; is a dark track, with an interesting rhythm section. Short and misterious. I like it very much! &quot;Vital signs&quot; closes the album with a reggae-like rhythm and some The Police influence. This closing number exactly points to what Rush would do in the next albums. &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; was a big success at the time of its release and continous to be a major rock'n roll album after all these years. An obligatory album in any kind of popular music collection ! Not as pop as everything they did between 84 and 91, not as hard as in the early years. A perfect balance between virtuosism, complexity and accesibility . That's Rush !

0679428895|5.0|I have always enjoyed well written historical fiction, especially if the story line stays fairly close to actual events. This new book falls perfectly into that category: well written, historically accurate, and with a plot that keeps you turning the pages. It also has characters with whom you can become involved, and the writing is of a level that it makes you wish the actual events turn out differently, even though you know that's not going to happen. That kind of feeling only comes with a book that completely enthralls readers, as this one assuredly does. The reader does tend to learn a bit more about volcanoes than he really needs to know, but this information never interferes with the onrushing plot, and you really do care about the fate of the principal characters. It's a good read, and I highly recommend it!
B0000C6K09|4.0|This boxed set covers Mr. Williams screen work from the beginning of his Spielberg era, and while that time has yeielded some remarkable music, it's unfair to call this collection definitive. Where are samples from the dozens of scores he created during the 60's and early 70's, like &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and &quot;Images&quot;, which may just be his best score ever? Recommended, nevertheless.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am sitting watching the Grammy's 2004 when Madonna comes out, and all I can think is how youthful she looks. I begin to realize I have yet to review any of her albums, so here I am. What I love about critics and fans is how different eveyone sees an album. There are the critics who say &quot;I hate it&quot; and don't tell you why. And then there are the people who say they like it because &quot;she's the best!&quot; The truth is, not everyone can say why something is good. So I hope to tell why this album is a very different but good album.<BR>1. American Life- This title track is great. I wish that she would have used the controversial video, but we were at war. There is a really funky beat that makes me want to listen to it over and over again. The rap in the middle of the song has to be the coolest part, because it's nothing we've heard from her before. She says the word &quot;f***&quot; too which is awsome. 5 stars.<BR>2. Hollywood- This is an interesting song. She really like to use funky beats to make you wanna dance. The chorus is so catchy. It's cool because she uses a lot of computer sounds, but then uses a plain guitar in the background. 4/5<BR>3. I'm so stupid- I LOVE THIS SONG. This song is different. That is one cool thing about her, is how different she is. There is a very annoying part where she hold this long note, but even it makes this song really cool. The beat once again adds a lot. 5/5<BR>4.Love Profusion- This is one of the songs with a good amount of guitar. When I hear it, I feel like I'm on the beach, or somewhere really sunny. It's a very nice feeling. <BR>5. Nobody Knows Me- This song is weird. It has a very techno beat to it. Even her voice is computerized. But this whole album is very computer sounding which is interesting.I love the lyrics. It's talking about how shes doesnt care what people think about her. She's gonna be who she is. 5/5<BR>6.Nothing Fails- This is a pretty slow song, but is beautiful. I love it, because how she talks about being so moved over something that she wants to pray. It's very spiritual, and I really enjoy hearing it.5/5<BR>7.Intervention-I really love how each song sounds. They are all different. She sings beautifully on this song. This cd has alot of spirituality and love in it,and this songs chorus is very chorus and sucks you in. 4/5<BR>8.X-static Process- Oh my god. This is another one of those songs I get this great feeling when it comes on. The guitar in this song really makes this song. This song is also very spiritual and talks about not knowing who you are. Theres no way to explain how good this song makes me feel. 10/5<BR>9.Mother and Father-This song has a really odd sound to it, but on this song she sounds very young and computerized. There is a rap in the middle that is just as good as &quot;American Life's&quot;. The lyrics are very well written, and it is touching. Very catchy. 4/5<BR>10.Die Another Day-AH! This song is so cool. It makes me wanna fight people and get really dirty. The beat in the song is so cool. I love the beginning with the &quot;da da da dada&quot; You'll what I'm saying when you hear it. 5/5<BR>11. Easy Ride- This song really moves me as well. When I hear it, I want to cry. There are no words to explain how this song touches my heart. 15/5<BR>I feel and hope that I explained why in my opinon this album is grand. It's so catchy and touching. I really enjoy listening to it. I went awhile without listening to it and now that I'm listen to it again I love it.
0156027321|4.0|You can't help but smile. <BR>Meet 16 year old Piscine Mollitor Patel, aka Pi (&quot;Pie&quot; so as not to be nicknamed Pissing.)  He is an Indian boy, living with his family is in a zoo in India.  (His father is the entrepreneur zookeeper.)  Pi loves God and Life so much he becomes a devote Hindu, Muslim and Christian, just because he wants to learn all the ways he can to love God and pray.  Then his father decides the family will move to Canada and take the animals too so they can sell them to American zoos... that is all just the first 100 pages.  <BR>But when the ship sinks in the pacific, and the only survivors are the boy (Pi), a 350 lb bengal tiger, a zebra with a broken leg, a hyena, and an orang-utan named Orange Juice, Pi must balance the equation of being a vibrant vegetarian drifting across the Pacific.  He becomes kind of like a wonderful little McGuyver on the 26ft lifeboat sharing quarters with a rapidly diminishing crew of wild animals.  He must learn his place in the predator/prey relationship; he must master the master of the food chain ... or become the final meal to a fierce carnivore.  <BR>Overall the book is very entertaining and is a good page turner, full of love and wonder and a bit of terror, but not at all in a horror way.  Full of human nature, and animal nature for that matter, LIFE OF PI reminds us lovingly to keep the faith and live a good life.  <br />I imagine this book will probably become standard summer reading if it hasn't yet already been so designated.  I feel light and and in touch with a deeper youthful part of myself while reading.
0792844882|5.0|Well, to be quite honest, this is the greatest NC-17 rated movie I have ever seen.  For the $$$, buy it, it is worth owning.
B000025XKM|5.0|I first heard Pink Moon, on that VW commerical, a few years later i decided to get the album.  It's is quickly becoming one of favoites.  Nick Drake is amazing. You can feel his depression through this album.  Thought his songs are very depression, i still find myself listening on.  I cant explain it.  Its amazing.
B00004RF8J|5.0|I can never get enough of this movie.  I love it ever since i saw the play.  Of course I saw the play before I saw the movie. It is very well put together. I listened to the commentary and the actors had to really be very careful while filiming around the plant otherwise they would have to start over. You would not be dissapointed if you get this dvd.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|Let me start off by saying this, yes I am a Matrix fan, i was as looking forward to the sequels as anyone.  That being said, you could not help but be dissapointed by Reloaded.  There was no way, and I do mean NO WAY it could have possibly lived up to the ridiculous expectations.  Then you have people calling a 300 million dollar grossing movie a dissapointment, and short lead time into the 3rd installment.  Sure Revolutions only made 140 million domestically, and heres why -  I think it is funny that people say the Wachaowskis mailed it in or just made these movies to grab cash.  These movies took between 4-5 years to put together.  They spent over 250 million on Reloaded and Revolutions.  That being said, these movies are NOT perfect but, most of the negative reviews of this movie look like they were written before the movie hit theaters.  Probably the biggest mistake the Wachowskis made, or whoever made this decision, was the decision to put Revolutions our 6 months after Reloaded.  We waited 5 years for Reloaded, I think a May 2004 release for Revolutions would have done wonders for box office receipts and critics who were probably saying, didnt I just review a Matrix movie 5 minutes ago?   I went in with low expectations because of the ridiculously overly critical reveiws.  What I got was a very good ending to one of the best trilogies of our time.  Where does it rank, take the guy that says it was the worst hes ever seen, take the guy who says its the best hes ever seen, and the answer is somewhere in the middle.
B000002I77|5.0|I'll keep it short.  This album is as good as it gets with regards to Jazz Fusion.  This is THE Billy Cobham album to get.  A lot of fusion is just mindless noodling, and as a result the syle gets a bad rap.  This album, along with \\"Inner Mounting Flame\\" and most stuff by Weather Report and Chic Corea is the quality stuff.<br /><br />This album features the guitarist Tommy Bolin, who died from a drug overdose just as his career was taking off.  His playing on this album, and outstanding interplay with Jan Hammer on keyboards, shows that he was a major talent cut short.<br /><br />This is a good starting point for anyone wanting to explore the musical style.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|My husband and I laughed outloud at this movie! Yes, both actors play somewhat shallow characters, but genuine affection does 1begin to develop between them in a way which seems credible. In the end, you sort of feel Nicholson is so shallow she shouldn't want to have any sort of friendly relationship with him, but this isn't a movie about reality, it's a movie about revenge -- revenge on all the stupid Hollywood movies that make adult women seem obsolete. The director could have toned down some of Keaton's high-pitched hysteria about men being attracted to her, but generally, we thought this movie was good enough we said to each other, \\"Let's see it a second time, sometime soon!\\"
B0000524CY|5.0|This was a movie that was extremely shocking and verbose for its time period (1973).  We see a tale of an 11 year old girl being possessed by a demon followed by continous suspense.  I believe this movie revolutionized the way people looked at horror flicks.  Between Regan's rotating head, the disturbing scene of her masturbation with a crucifix, and the unbelievably random scene where she spider walks down the stairs.  The extra scenes really added to the value of an already classic movie.  <br />From beginning to end this movie will keep you on the edge.  It really makes you think about what is going on.  The part that I especially felt was when you could see the imprints of the words \\"HELP ME\\" on Regan's stomach when they lift her shirt up a little bit.  That was a wild scene to say the least.  The acting was superb.  Ellen Bursten and Linda Blair are amazing in their parts.  William Peter Blatty created a real gem with this masterpiece.  As of now, I haven't seen a tale of possession that has been able to touch this classic.  If you enjoyed this movie, also check out The Omen movies, which were also great ones.
6305364648|5.0|&quot;True Lies&quot; is quite simply, one of the most entertaining, fast paced and hilarious films that Arnold Schwarzenegger has ever starred in.  From the very first time I saw this movie in the theater to several viewings both in VHS and DVD format, I've found that the superior script and exceptional acting in this film entertains every time.  I've read of and heard many lament over some aspects of this film and the best I could say to those is that quite often the movies that Hollywood produces are a sensationalism of real life events and ultimately a movie such as this one is for entertainment not making statements about any one group or individual and as a medium for entertainment, this film succeeds completely!<br />Performance wise, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Arnold, Bill Paxton, Tia Carrere and Art Malik all deserve great honors and the accolades they received for their respective parts in this film.  &quot;True Lies&quot; was probably Arnold Schwarzenegger's best overall performance both in the action and the dramatic sense.  Jamie Lee Curtis couldn't have been any better in this role and I can honestly say that I was impressed with Tom Arnold's performance in this movie whereas any other film or show I've seen him in I was not impressed.  I believe the only other movie I've seen that Art Malik was in was &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; and in both that movie and this one his work has been exceptional.<br />Say what you may like about director James Cameron but you would definitely have to admit that prior to the current but most likely &quot;temporary&quot; culmination of his career as a director with the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; and heading off to run the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; television series, few directors could come close to matching his accomplishments.  &quot;True Lies&quot; was James Cameron's fifth highly successful hit in a row and with this movie and &quot;Titanic&quot; one could definitely say that during this run of boxoffice hits, he had the pulse of the fans as he wrote screenplays and directed these extraordinary films.<br />The Premise:<br />Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a high speed &quot;spook&quot; working for a highly secretive government agency that is a watch dog/operator spook agency that identifies and handles terrorist threats to the United States.  Along with his handler Albert Gibson (Tom Arnold), they uncover a major terrorist operation which is bent on using nuclear warheads against the US to accomplish its goals.  As Harry, Albert and their organization are working to uncover the terrorists plot; his family becomes heavily involved in the story which is where Helen Tasker (Jamie Lee Curtis) comes in to play and some extremely hilarious scenes involving Simon (Bill Paxton).  What follows from there is one of the most hilarious and exciting action/drama films to have come out of the nineties.<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all who are interested in seeing a great, fast paced, highly intriguing and hilarious action/drama movie and aren't interested in reading too much into the plot or the characters in the plot that are used as plot devices.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />-Original Theatrical Trailer
B000002INJ|2.0|&quot;We live to ride!&quot;  If you can listen to the first track, as well as &quot;The warriors prayer&quot; without busting out laughing, then you have problems of a serious nature.  &quot;A great hammer of war!&quot;  &quot;Who were they?

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is not a review for fans to read, because nothing I can say will help you make a decision, or give you any new facts about the forthcoming film, or really say anything fascinating and insightful about Firefly.<br />This is a review for those of you who (like me) had never heard of Firefly until Amazon.com recommended it to me.  When that happened, I immediately dismissed the show as crap, because of the description listed for the item.  I mean, really.  It made it sound like your run-of-the-mill SciFi channel crapola.  \\"Stake a claim in the action?\\"  \\"Take any job... to keep fuel in the tanks and food on the table?\\"  \\"Desperate to steer clear of Alliance ships and the flesh-eating Reavers who live on the fringes of space?\\"  That, friends, is a recipe for an unimaginative, worthless and otherwise forgettable TV series.<br />Thank goodness the description was so stupidly wrong.<br />I'm not sure why I even went out and bought it, two months later.  But, WOW, I'm glad I did.<br />Sure that hard-boiled-frontiersman-outlaw-rough-and-tumble-badass description is part of the show.  What the box doesn't tell you is that -- apart from the very, very good pilot episode -- none of that stuff is at the forefront.  It's never just about the job they're doing, or the money they need, or about running from Reavers, or even running from the Alliance.  Because the writers knew that would be dumb.<br />This show is, honest to goodness, about the characters.  Even the gratuitous geisha (yes, I know they call her a \\"companion,\\" but I *didn't* know that when I was deciding whether or not to buy the show... and yes, she is gratuitous, so please don't ravage me for not understanding why she's there) character has some manner of depth.  While we may not like every aspect of every character, or even understand why they were written in, the characters are always the focus.  Their decisions, emotions, actions and concerns are what makes the show more than just a scifi/western/action show.<br />But let's not forget the scifi/western/action elements.  Those, like the writing, effects, sets, plots and characters, are supurb.  The universe of Firefly is very rich, always interesting, and something we can identify with.  There's never too much \\"western,\\" and never too much \\"scifi\\" to swallow at one sitting.  <br />So, don't buy this set because you like science fiction.  Buy it because you like good TV, and good fiction.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I finally got around to seeing Chicago fairly recently and I have to admit that I don't know if it really deserved the Best Picture Oscar that it won, but I think the combination of the sheer spectacle and the fact that Chicago returns a long-lost genre to prominence put it over the top.<br />The musical numbers are spectacularly staged and it is easy to see why Catherine Zeta-Jones won her Oscar.  The biggest surprise has to be Richard Gere, who acquits himself better than anyone could have possibly anticipated.  I was a bit disappointed with Renee Zellweger, only in the sense that she seems to have played this type of role before and, while her singing and dancing are good, she's blown off the screen by Zeta-Jones.  Also deserving of praise is John C. Reilly, who performs what is perhaps the most poignant song &quot;Mr. Cellophane&quot;.<br />All of the songs fill that number one criteria for a musical - you find yourself humming or whistling them long after the film is over. It may be somewhat overblown and overhyped, but it is a very satisfying film and does deliver a solid entertainment value.
0375432302|3.0|Well, it's interesting to see by his remarkable new bestseller, THE DA VINCI CODE, that author Dan Brown has been reading many of the same books I have.  Not sure if I should congratulate or pity.  In 1984, I bought my first copy of Baigent, Leigh and Lincoln's controversial and much maligned HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, a veritable Pandora's box of secret societies, heretical orders, medieval murder and intrigue involving (supposedly) an astonishing array of some of the greatest artists and thinkers in Occidental history.  Aside from some particularly sensational claims, the book did host an impressive measure of very scholarly research into certain shadowy avenues of history I had few ideas about.  I was, in a word, hooked.<br />In the years since then, along with my regular diet of novels and mainstream nonfiction, I consumed a good deal of HOLY BLOOD spin-offs.  Too many, really; a few were quite fun, but most were just strange and preposterous crackpot pseudo-histories.  Like the flying saucers of the fifties and sixties, suddenly the whole of ancient and classical Christendom was somehow encoded with one great secret message after another, and amateur symbologists and geometers were having an endless field day.  Never naive enough to become disillusioned in any real sense, still I was disappointed that more serious research wasn't being done, but it seemed the whole tainted business had become anathema to the powers that be in our present-world academia.<br /><br />Dan Brown is, undeniably, well read in this area.  What he lacks in prose style--which is considerable--he almost makes up for in his use of all this anecdotal history, this mudslide of minutiae, a manic, relentless assault upon the reader.  I can only imagine how this all might affect someone who has never read of or heard any of these theories before.<br /><br />If, as a fiction writer, Brown has mastered anything, it's the trick of the twist, unexpected turns of events stacked so densely one atop the other here as to be mind-numbingly humorous.  Reading DA VINCI, I thought of nothing more than old James Bond movies--then it occurred to me how Oliver Stone had done much the same thing with his movie JFK.  Recipe being, you get yourself a juicy conspiracy, gather together every known crumb of theory and leftover tale concerning it, throw in a few more or less interesting characters (the wooden variety will do just fine; no time to waste), sprinkle in a few exotic, historically drenched locales, stir and heat to a rolling boil until the lid goes through the roof.<br /><br />If the function of art is to arrest the mind, Dan Brown succeeds only in testing it.  And if the pace of his novel were not so astonishingly quick, he would succeed also in trying our patience.  He seems to be betting all along on a sure hand of keeping one step ahead of the reader and in that I'm quite sure he has not failed himself.e other here as to be mind-numbingly humorous.

B000089RVX|1.0|This is not goth!  The 'goth' label is thrown around so loosely and generally perceived as a dying subculture which needs to be revived and brought back into the lime-light, so labelling whatever is new, innovative and dark as goth is a quick urgent fix-up.  This, much like many other modern angsty and pseudo-philosophical slop, is just conforming to another trend trying to exploit a fashionable alienation and justify the intent.  As for groundbreaking...  I'd say it's more annoying, if anything.  Her voice is so generic and emotionless.  She hollers and whinges the most uninspired lyrics repeatedly and the music is just as lifeless.  I can't believe the hype over this garbage.  It's like saying Avril Lavigne is a hardcore punk!  It's not always necessary to smack a label on something new because it may be remotely different.  This is not 'cutting edge' and this is certainly not 'goth'...  Another thing, I so don't want to hear Bring Me To Life ever again.  I am so sick of it - from a group I don't even like.

B0000B1OFL|4.0|Okay, so this film is never going to win any Oscars, and the product placement may irk some. But so what? You have to know what you're going in for...and if you're in the mood for action and a cool heist plot a la Ocean's Eleven or The Thomas Crown Affair (Pierce Brosnan not Steve McQueen), then you'll probably like this one. The plot involves a team of high tech thieves who pull a job (the titular one in Italy) and are betrayed by one of their own who in the process kills the mentor of the gang (Donald Sutherland). So now they have enlisted the mentor's daughter (Charlize Theron) who is a top notch safecracker and are going to pull another job (this one's in Los Angeles) to get revenge on their former partner. The &quot;jobs&quot; are slick in execution, there are some good comedic performances (notably Seth Green), and the climactic car chase with the Minis is great! A very fun and diverting movie.
B00008PW2D|2.0|Eight episodes for the price of 18?  No thanks!  Answering to the comment along the lines of &quot;nobody else can do this&quot;...how about &quot;frasier&quot; who pulls 22 consistantly hilarious episodes?  The price is a disaster on this set!  We really need to let these people know that we aren't idiots.  I pay for quality AND quantity.
B000066NW0|1.0|Funny how Avril is compared to Alanis Morrissette in the editiorial review.  Alanis is just one of the artists that Avril has slagged off to make herself look tougher.  It's disgusting.  Avril is not an artist.  She is a waste of space and air-time.  Seems she's too consumed with her 'hardcore punk' image and slagging off other artists to sincerely care about her music (which is mostly produced by her 'writing team').  Songs like 'Sk8er Boi', which she discribes as &quot;Deep and emotional&quot; - I'd be more inclined to classify as short-lived juvenile rubbish.  Any song I've heard of her's has sounded so formulaic and dull - and she seems to lack the intellect to back up the opinions she's trying to express publicly.  I mean, she can't be too smart if she thinks a badly-written song about a teenage infatuation is 'deep' and slagging off another highly renowned (and actually talented) artist is easily dismissible.
B00005JLK1|5.0|When i first saw this movie,(i bought it in okinawa japan on the last part of my overseas tour in the service)from start to finish that is, i thought,Damn! that was a really good movie. Now really people!, in all honesty i have read some of the other reviews on this flick before i wrote my own here and all i can say is &quot;wow, people are hard to please these days!&quot; I have seen a review that said something about the razor wire slicing all those people in half being too gruesome or something like that! you're kidding right? while they could have added a little more gore to that and the rest of the killing scenes,i still believe that it is all done quite well. Not to mention a killer score with a kicka** group like mudvayne included! In my book that rated 5 stars right there! What more could half of us ask for! You get some good ol' blood and gore, some good violence here and there, in my opinion a plot that was pretty good, and HELLO!,not to mention a little bit of seduction on the side as a garnish. I'm thinkin that when that ghost of that singer,(i think she might have been singing in italian,remember that woman in the killer red dress that is singing in the very first scene of the movie)got naked in front of that guy and eventually led him over a cliff, chances are if she had done anything more to that poor guy before killing him we probably would have had a different rating here people! There is only one thing i didn't like about this movie, the ending! I felt like i needed a noose around my neck because all it did was majorly leave me HANGING! I won't tell you any more because i don't want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it yet, but all i will say is that someone needs to really hurry up and come out with a ghost ship 2!
B00005J6T0|5.0|This album,released in the summer of 1986,spawned many hits as its predecessor LIKE A VIRGIN. Madonna was then a short-haired bleached blonde. The first hit LIVE TO TELL,was released as a single before this album. It's from the movie &quot;At Close Range&quot;. The next hit was PAPA DON'T PREACH. Then the title track became a hit,but not part of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. OPEN YOUR HEART,the next hit,is really cool. In the video,Madonna has a little boy as her dancing partner. In early 1987,when this album was still on the hit parade,LA ISLA BONITA became a hit. Except where indicated,the aforementioned songs became part of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION. WHITE HEAT is a tribute to the late James Cagney,who was a major movie star in the 40's. The other songs are very good. By the way,a remix of WHERE'S THE PARTY? appears on the follow-up YOU CAN DANCE. This album was one top 1986's top sellers.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|Probably the best album to ever be released by the Foo Fighters, &quot;The Colour &amp; The Shape&quot; further solidified Dave Grohl stepping out of grunge's shadow and making peace with the ghost of Kurt Cobain.  Just about all the songs here on this album are catchy and seem made for radio friendly, but underneath that surface is a demonically comical feel combined with a lot of emotion.  On songs like the short opener &quot;Doll&quot;, &quot;February Stars&quot;, and the classic single &quot;Everlong&quot; you can hear the raw emotion in Grohl's voice, and that is something that no one can fake.  &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; is still a great song, no matter how much it got overplayed, although another session of &quot;My Hero&quot; may prove nerve wracking considering it can be heard just about anywhere.  Other great songs like &quot;Hey! Johnny Park&quot;, &quot;My Poor Brain&quot;, &quot;See You&quot;, and &quot;Walking After You&quot; (featured on the X-Files film soundtrack) are all great songs as well, and the band's tight musicianship rounds out this excellent package.  All in all, &quot;The Colour &amp; The Shape&quot; is in my opinion the best Foo Fighters album yet, and is undoubtadly one of the finest albums of the 90's.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|If you were ever to get one Van Halen album, this is the one.  It was hard heavy and an evolutionary step forward in guitar playing all the way through.  Eddie Van Halen was at his best right here. Just listen to &quot;Eruption&quot; if you want to know what Eddie was truly capable of. &quot;Runnin' with the Devil&quot; was a great way to start off the album and the bass line for it was great.  &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; were two of the best covers I have heard.  &quot;Aint Talkin 'Bout Love&quot; and &quot;I'm the One&quot; have a tight but loose feel to them.  &quot;Jamie's Crying&quot; was a great slow song.  Though their best slow song on this album was &quot;Little Dreamer&quot;.  This album is for anybody who likes good rock music.
0553565915|4.0|Embraced by the Light is a wonderful book, but so many people just focus on their own lessons they learned, which makes for an interesting story, but I am always looking for more - how does this apply to me? Do I have to have an NDE myself? I liked Tiffany Snow's book better, just one chapter about her great  NDE, but the rest of it shows how anyone can open up, if they learn how. I'm not saying Embraced by the Light  is a bad book, really, but I guess I was just expecting more.
B00005J6SZ|5.0|This album,Madonna's second,spawned 5 Top 20 hits between late 1984 and mid-1985. The title track was released as a single before this album. She performed the song at the first annual MTV Video Music Awards in the fall of 1984. She wore the dress with the &quot;Boy Toy&quot; belt buckle like she did in the front cover photo. Other hits are MATERIAL GIRL,which reporters would label her as to this very day. There's also ANGEL,DRESS YOU UP and LOVE DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE. None of those tracks became part of THE IMMACULATE COLLECTION,like the title track and MATERIAL GIRL did. OVER AND OVER appeared in remix form on YOU CAN DANCE. In the summer of 1985,when this album was still on the hit parade,Madonna married actor Sean Penn,from whom she is currently divorced. &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic used the title track's music for his parody LIKE A SURGEON. Following the release of this album,Madonna would become a movie star with &quot;Desperately Seeking Susan&quot; being her first film. When this album was still on the charts,she scored two other hits,not from this album,but from DSS,INTO THE GROOVE and CRAZY FOR YOU from &quot;Vision Quest&quot;.
0380789019|2.0|I saw all the positive reviews for this book and decided to grab it.  I can't for the life of me figure out why people love it so much.  It was one of the few books I didn't want to finish.  Granted, it was excellent storytelling...but the story, in my opinion, is boring.  With little to no action, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone looking for a little adventure.
0140067477|1.0|Hurrah for Western Civilization, the predominant culture-set on the planet!<br />Benjamin Hoff allows his Neo-Luddite hate speech to infiltrate his otherwise half-witted diatribe against academia, work, and progress.  (How is it that most &quot;progressives&quot; I've met feel a need to romanticize about a *past* that never existed?)  While saying that conservatives, scholars, and people who *do* rather than pontificate, are WRONG, this joker talks about the gentle Chinese and all their contributions to society.<br />How can one, logically, bemoan the fate of Tibet while praising the Chinese for their cultural sensitivity?  How can one, logically, complain about the ecology in the US in contrast to China (Maybe Chinese industrial waste is just culturally superior to ours?).  We have protesters here in the US.  We just don't run them over with military hardware.  Those culturally sensitive Chinese are just GREAT!<br />This is not to say that the Chinese are bad.  How can a civilization that brought us Kung Pao Chicken be all *that* bad?  Let us, however, be fair.  Eastern Civilizations have been every bit as cruel as Western ones.  Hoff would do well to learn that, worldwide, people have been miserable t@rds to each other for ages.  He complains about a culture that allows dissent;  I suspect that this disdain stays with him all the way to the bank.  If he were to be critical *of* China *in* China, he may well find that his royalty checks would be found under &quot;Contraband Property&quot; and that *he* would be found under a tank.<br />If you want to find out about Taoism read a book on Taoism.  If you want to read frantic rants about Western culture, Hoff's books may be for you.

The tracks I love are LOVE PROFUSION,HOLLYWOOD and the title track. You won't find lyrics in the CD or cassette booklet. This is really a kick-ass album though.

068817776X|4.0|This is an interesting work of non-fiction that, at times, reads as if it were a novel. Based upon the recollection of a secular Austrian Jew, a young woman named Edith Hahn, the book tells the reader her intriguing story. During the Holocaust,  she married  a member of the Nazi party whom she had told she was Jewish. He married her and kept her secret. In the waning days of the war, her husband was drafted into the German army and ended up a prisoner of war for a time. Upon his return, he found  a crumbling German infra-structure, the Nazis out of favor, and his Jewish wife asserting herself as she really was, a well-educated, independent woman.<br />This is essentially a book about Ms. Hahn's life just before, during, and just after World War II. It tells the reader about her life in Austria before the Nazis took over. She was a well-educated woman studying to be a lawyer, when the Gestapo put an end to her professional aspirations.  She was sent to work at a labor camp and while doing so,  her mother was deported to a concentration camp, before they could be re-united. Seeing that the writing was on the wall for the Jews of Austria, she went underground with the help of a Christian friend and fled to Germany. It was while she lived an underground life in Germany under an assumed name, that she met Werner Vetter, a Nazi party member who fell in love with her. Notwithstanding her confession that she was Jewish, he married her and never betrayed her.<br />She tells a tale of sublimation of self in order to survive the rigors of the policies of Nazi Germany that were imposed upon Austria, her country and a land where anti-Semitism was rife. She tells a tale of sublimation of self in order to survive her marriage to a person whose views were so opposite her own. Her fears of discovery were so acute that during childbirth, she refused to take any pain medication or anesthesia for fear of betraying her own self while under sedation. Her only child, a daughter, Angelika, is believed to be the only child born of a Jewish mother in a Reich hospital in 1944. Though Edith loved her husband, she never felt free to be herself until the war was over. Hers is a story of  immobilizing fear and survival.<br />This is an intriguing perspective on the Holocaust from the voice of one who who was in a singular position during the latter half of the war, as she was a Jew in Germany.is believed to be the only child born of a Jewish mother in a Reich hospital in 1944.

0385504209|4.0|This is a very interesting, gripping and riveting novel. I'm sure that you don't want to leave it when you start to read once. I liked it very much, with just one objection. Please don't read any further if you have not read the book yet!<br />******* Warning!.. Spoilers hereafter!.. *******<br />Please try to remember the moment Remy drinks the cognac given him by The Teacher, or better, open the book and turn the pages up to Chapter 94 and look for the following paragraph (I have the Turkish print of the novel and the following is my own translation to English, so it surely will differ from the original. But I hope that it would give you an idea of where to look):<br />&quot;The Teacher stepped to the back door of the limousine and thought 'we have just one problem left here to solve. The police will have no idea of what happened... and there will be no witnesses alive to tell them the truth.' He then opened the door, looking around quickly just to be sure no one's watching, and got in the car.&quot;<br />I, for myself, had some idea of who the Teacher might be, and had a guess up to that point. (I'm sure, that all readers did the same, and all of you smiled and said yourself &quot;I already guessed that!&quot; when the secret about the Teacher's identity revealed some chapters later.)<br />But after I read the aforementioned paragraph, I thought that I was wrong with my first guess, considering that &quot;an author may hide the truth from readers for sometime, but he/she should never try to deceive/fool/mislead them&quot;.<br />As I said, thought that I was wrong. Because we know there is only Sir Leigh Teabing tied in the back seat, no one or nothing else there; and if the Teacher and Teabing were the same person as I guessed before, the Teacher's action of stepping to the back door and his thinking of 'just one problem left here to solve' would be purposeless and nonsense. That means the Teacher should be someone else, and he 'stepped to the back door' to finish Teabing off who was 'the last problem left'.<br />In fact, as we would realize chapters later, Teabing *is* the Teacher, and this paragraph seemed as if it was written to mislead the readers in their guesses intentionally. Do you think that an author should have such a right ?<br />Finally, i'd like to rephrase my point, just for the sake of emphasizing it : I was really surprised when the mystery about the Teacher was uncovered, so I returned to the Chapter 94, re-read the aforementioned paragraph, and thought like this : 'Teabing is the Teacher and he's outside the car now. That means there isn't anybody in the back seat of the car anymore. So why exactly does he step to the back door thinking 'we have just one problem left here to solve.' and<br />get in the back of the car ? Does it make any sense to you ? What do you think the author's intention is with this paragraph ?<br />Any thoughts ?f who was 'the last problem left'.<BR>In fact, as we would realize chapters later, Teabing *is* the Teacher, and this paragraph seemed as if it was written to mislead the readers in their guesses intentionally.

B0000UJL96|5.0|Following the disastrous critical and box office reception of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Paramount could have easily dropped the original cast in favor of The Next Generation. However, sentiment prevailed and Nicholas Meyer, who directed The Wrath of Khan (still the most popular film with most Trekkers) and who co-wrote The Voyage Home (still the highest grossing Trek film), was called in. He, along with Leonard Nimoy, fashioned a script which features most of what has made Trek endure through the years: a relevant story drawing on then current events (i.e., the lightning paced changes in the relationship between the United States and the then Soviet Union, which precipitated the end of the Cold War), with plenty of action, drama, humor (appropriate humor, not slapstick) and character development. Thus, the original cast would be able to exit the franchise with their heads held high.<br />The pacing of this film is much smoother than the earlier films (even Treks II &amp; IV took too long to get moving) starting swiftly and accelerating to the pulse-pounding conclusion. The overall tone of the film is darker and edgier than any previous Trek (perhaps the filmmakers were taking a cue from 1989s Batman, which obliterated Star Trek V at the box office). The directing is fluid, with Meyer's camera swooping around the bridge (a notoriously difficult set to film in) and the other sets, and the editing is tight. Although the story primarily (and correctly) focuses the action on the triumvirate of Kirk, Spock &amp; McCoy, the supporting cast is given plenty to do as well. Sulu, in particular--finally Captain of his own ship--has greater involvement. Guest star Christopher Plummer molds General Chang into Trek's best villain since Khan, and David Warner makes a lends an air of dignity as Chancellor Gorkon (the name is an amalgamation of Gorbachev and Lincoln). There are a few additions from the theatrical version which have appeared on all video versions: The Colonel West plotline was not in the original film (perhaps Paramount thought the parallel to Colonel Oliver North was too obvious).  For this DVD, there are also few small alterations during the Spock/Valeris Mind Meld scene.<br />All of the charm of Classic Trek is here: a final needling exchange between Spock &amp; McCoy; the occasional, almost improvised humor; characters being thrown every which way on the bridge during battle; Kirk kissing a beautiful female; one last bit of scenery chewing from Shatner, who holds his own against fellow hamosaurus Plummer; and, finally, a bittersweet ending.<br />The visual effects of The Undiscovered Country (a reference to Shakespeare) hold up well, with very little use of stock shots (three effects shots from this film would later be used in 1994s Star Trek Generations). The score by Cliff Eidelmann accentuates the activities on screen, without overshadowing them, and adds to the dark atmosphere of the film.<br />The transfer on this DVD is excellent, with the colors, especially the maroon uniform jackets, crisp &amp; vibrant--an improvement over the previous DVD, and light years ahead of the VHS and LaserDisc editions. Since the film was shot in &quot;matted&quot; Super 35, rather than Panavision, the aspect ratio is not as wide as the other Trek films. The sound is detailed with plenty of punch.<br />The bonus features are the best of any Trek film so far, including featurettes on the evolution of the story, prejudice in the Trek universe, Shatner's &quot;reunion&quot; with Plummer (back in the 1950s, Shatner understudied for Plummer in Henry V), and a moving tribute to the late DeForest Kelley.West plotline was not in the original film (perhaps Paramount thought the parallel to Colonel Oliver North was too obvious).

0486266885|3.0|In this story, Mr. Utterson, lawyer and friend of Jekyll is trying through friendly concern to discover the truth about the young and disreputable Mr. Hyde who he believes is coercing the doctor. Jekyll is always one step ahead of him in covering up Hyde's true existence until Jekyll is no longer able to control his transformations and Utterson is called by the frightened servants to intervene. This was an enjoyable story though brief.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was remarkably subdued story from what I expected. Having seen the movie Mary Reilly previous to reading this book, I expected Mr. Hyde to be more fully developed. What Mr. Hyde does that is so 'evil' is never specified (I mean in terms of general lifestyle - the murder is covered). In fact, the only real reference we get to this life is the character of his dwelling and the presence there of penny novels (cheap, ill respected literature). Except for the murder of an undeveloped character and a general rudeness, we don't really get to know Mr. Hyde as the evil monster I expected.  Mr. Hyde is afraid to leave the lab for fear of the gallows but that is as close to a manhunt as we get, unlike in Frankenstein where the chase seems to cover half of the globe or in The Invisible Man were a serious manhunt provides a great deal of action and pace.  Mr. Hyde is also a great deal different from how he is represented by Hollywood (for instance, he is shorter than Dr. Jekyll).  I guess I was expecting a more likable or romantic villain giving rise to more of a dilemma in trying to destroy him.<br /><br />This story should be read. I am not trying to \\"dis'\\" it.  I just expected more out of it because later authors/producers pulled out of it way, way more than was in the original. What this story has is raw potential.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|I avoided this movie when it came out in the theater, dismissing it as &quot;yet another Vampire/Werewolf rehash&quot;; a presumptuous sentiment I now regret, having recently watched it for the first time on DVD. My opinion of it now? Quite the opposite... I *love* this movie. &quot;Hooked&quot; is another good word to describe my reaction to it.<br />The creators of this film have done a wonderful job of taking the conventional Vampire/Werewolf mythos and twisting it around, taking a fresh new approach. No mysticism, crucifixes or wooden stakes here... There are sunlight and silver bullets... though Len Wiseman and co. have given the theme a scientific twist that is convincing and consistent. Many may dislike this new direction, but to me, it's a breath of fresh air.<br />To his credit, director and co-writer Len Wiseman made the decision to go with less CG for the creature and special effects, opting for the tried and true method of using prosthetics, make-up, cables and animatronics. The results are, for one example, werewolves that have a more tactile and real look to them, where computer-generated effects all-too-often are never quite convincing enough. There are a few CG moments scattered throughout the film, but they're fleeting, used to good effect and do not detract from the movie at all. It's a lower-budget film with very high production values. The sets are great and the whole movie really maintains the dark and gritty feel that its title evokes.<br />How about the story?<BR>I won't go into the premise of the film. Many others here have already done a fine enough job in their reviews. I will say the story is another aspect of this film that, for me, elevates it far above being &quot;just another supernatural slasher/horror flick&quot;. The story starts off seemingly simple... Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for centuries and a specific group of Vampires, called Death Dealers, are charged with bringing about the Lycans' extinction. The movie starts out explaining this on-going battle through the narration of the films main protagonist, Selene who is, herself, a Death Dealer. However, as the story develops, you find that there is much more going on than originally revealed and, by the end of the movie, there are enough twists and turns to satisfy even the most jaded viewer. <br />It's intelligent and is conveyed via well written and delivered dialog. I cannot think of one line in this movie that seemed cheesy or made me cringe. One scene in which Viktor, one of the Vampire elders, slays a Lycan was taken a *wee* bit farther than necessary, I think. But that's hardly a complaint... just a minor personal quip.<br />The casting and acting in Underworld also receives high marks. For one, Kate Beckinsale (Selene) delivers an absolutely stunning and intoxicating performance. She's perfect in this role and, by the way, looks incredible.<br />For their part, the rest of the cast deliver a solid performance as well. There are no cardboard-cutouts in this movie. Every actor commands their role skillfully and adequately and I found myself caring about what happens to each one.<br />I could go on much longer about this movie, and there would be nothing but positive.. but I think I've made my point :-).<br />If you want to see a slick, stylish and all around well-done movie, you'd do well to see Underworld.
0385504209|5.0|I can honestly say this is a great book.  Consider, that I am not a fan of books...or reading...except for my monthly Maxim.  I saw the 400 plus page book and thought there was no way I would read it.  Decided to pick it up one day....needless to say...it took me 3 days to read it.  Never in my life have I come across a book that I &quot;wanted&quot; to read.  Waiting to see if they have a movie come out for it...I would be 1st in line for tickets.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I kept waiting for the movie to get started - and then the credits were rolling.   Yawn.  It was so slow, dull and hard to connect with.  Definitely not \\"Love In the Afternoon\\" but equally hard to digest the love angle - sorry- but maybe photographing Murray in reduced light as they did Cooper would have helped.  <BR>The most interesting parts were scenes of Tokoyo.  Bill Murray I love, but some how his connection with his young costar as a love interest were lost in translation - maybe they were hinting at some female version of an Edipus complex .  I'm just so confused.  Murray  certainly seemed more in line to be her dad.<BR>The hype done by the media was great though - got me to buy the DVD - and now its going on to be sold as used - once.
0789723107|4.0|Quit wasting time listening to the &quot;experts&quot; and find out yourself with this book<br />Couple of great points-- <BR>We don't read pages. We scan them. <BR>Sad but true...(sad for those who labor hours over graphics and sadder for those bustin' their nut to write web friendly and readable copy) <br />The exception as Krug points out are news stories, reports, or product descriptions. &quot;But even then, if the document is longer than a few paragraphs, we're likely to print it out because it's easier and faster to read on paper than on a screen.&quot; I found that out when my magazine -AboutBizz Magazine decided to put our print magazine online. We spent months redesigning [...] (I wish I would've found Steve's book two years ago when we started the redesigns -- it would've saved us hours and hours of waste!) We find that our printer friendly pages are always the most accessed pages. <br />He states that we scan because we're usually in a hurry and we're really only interested in a fraction of what's on the webpage. We only look for what matches our interests and the rest of it is ignored. He does a great job of proving this by showing HOW the eye scans your webpage --(If you don't have your logo in the top right corner after reading this then you must pass go and cannot collect your $200.) <br />Krug has another &quot;Fact of Life&quot; where he states We don't figure out how things work. We muddle through it. <BR>I wholeheartedly agree. I for years have referred to this as the &quot;scrunch factor&quot;. We've all done it...it's when you see or read something, and if you don't quit &quot;get it&quot; or understand what they message conveyed is or can't connect the dots in your minds eye, then you scrunch -- your forehead wrinkles, eyebrows drop, eye's look critical -if you're married then you've possibly seen this look from your spouse ;) <br />Of the most value is where Steve describes how you can run your own cheap and inexpensive focus study group using a few people, a number of choice questions, and a simple camcorder. After reading this, you will walk away realizing that ANYONE can do their own research and have real answers to how people their website. <br />It reminded me of a passage out of the classic book, TESTED ADVERTISING METHODS by John Caples. Early on in the book Caples talks about how in years to come who more advertisers will use more scientific methods to get better results with their ads. He talks about how every person had an opinion on what works...long copy, short copy, headlines, no headlines, sketches, etc.. <BR>Let me quote the book, <br />&quot;Not long after that I began to work on mail order advertising. Each advertisement was tested. Results were tabulated. Each advertisement and each publication had to prove itself in actual sales. <BR>I know now that much of the talk (of other people) I heard was just talk. Too often, the ad men were stating opinions, not facts. And in many cases, the opinions were not even the boiled-down opinions of a large group of people. They were personal opinions. <BR>If the real foundation of those opinions could be discovered by psychoanalysis, it would be laughable in many cases. An artist might favor blue backgrounds in advertisements because blue was his mothers favorite color. A copywriter might recommend short copy because his wife once said, 'I would never read all that small print, and I don't think anybody else would, either.'...&quot; <br />If you are in the midst of designing your website, or trying to get someone to pay attention to it, you will find plenty of &quot;experts&quot; telling you what works. Remember what Caples says, keep my words in mind, do yourself a large favor, go out and buy &quot;Don't Make Me Think! A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability&quot; by Steve Krug and find out YOURSELF what works. It's a no-brainer. <br />Pros: <BR>You'll never find in another book this great inexpensive method to do focus study research<BR>Cons: <BR>Wish he would have given examples how the eye scans applies to HTML email<br />The Bottom Line: <BR>Use the information found on creating your own focus study -- &amp; you may change the way your site looks...Why? Because the USER will tell you what really is working.
B000001FOS|5.0|First of all this MIGHT have been seen as &quot;selling out&quot; by making this album a commercial type of album. Yngwie recruited vocalist extraordinaire, Joe Lynn Turner, to perform on &quot;Odyssey.&quot; Joe Lynn also wrote all the lyrics for the 1988 effort, and the result was like magic. The two complimented each other perfectly, and together they created an album that outshines all others. The highlights were the ballads, Joe Lynn has a gorgeous voice and he was the best vocalist the Malmsteen had hired out of all the albums that he had created. Yngwie's guitar rips your heart out, and Joe Lynn's vocals tear it apart. When he sings Dreamin' (Tell Me) it is so beautiful that it still the heart. The lyrics only add to the sorrow with verses like &quot;dreaming visions of you, feeling the love I never knew&quot; and another favorite is &quot;here we are on the crossroads of forever, shining star lights the way, walk with me on the winds of time, love's mystery is for us to find.&quot; And the guitar music in this one blends with the music wonderfully. Its not too loud, it allows Turner to really get to you with his soaring vocals, but its there, a sweet, harp-like acoustic in the background, and then during the solo it switches to a bubbling electric, that fits the mood of the song. Hold On is another classic ballad from this album, and in some ways is even more heartbreaking than Dreamin'. The opening guitar riff is an attention grabber, and makes the heart skip a beat when it starts up, its so beautiful. Hold On has a bluesy type feel to it, and the vocals are lush and beautiful, only Turner could perform them like this. There are some rockers on &quot;Odyssey&quot; too, like the thundering Rising Force which has another great verse in it &quot;the lightning strikes cracking the night, it feels like never before, thunder and sparks in the Heart of the Dark, I hear a rising force&quot;. There is also an off-with-their-heads gothic metal song, that leaves you missing the days when Ronnie James Dio would sing songs about witches,demons, dragons, and magic spells, in Rainbow, Sabbath, and Dio. The song is called Riot In the Dungeons and is really killer, the necromancer rips on this one. Another album hot spot is Deja Vu. Overall, &quot;Odyssey&quot; was wonderful, there was no way Yngwie could ever top this, especially since Turner left to join Deep Purple, so Yng was forced to find another singer. Swedish born, Goran Edman came in to fill in the spot
B0000019PA|1.0|When someone said, &quot;You like REM right? You'll probably like this&quot; there was no way I was going to miss out.<br />How I wish I did.<br />Right from the start you have to wonder how this cd was ever produced. It sounds like its been recorded in a bedroom with no carpeting or furnishings to speak of, and using a guitar found in the shopping trolley of a can collecting toothless old lady.<br />By the time I had reached the track '2 headed boy' I seriously thought my brain was going to implode and there would be Scannersesque moment in front of my work mates.  WARNING, do NOT listen to this on headphones. Direct penetration into the skull may well cause permanent damage.<br />If this really is a serious album, then American music surely has a problem.  5 stars from the amazon reviewers for this warbling, out of tune, mess of words and notes......   no thanks.  I'd rather listen to the inside of a warthogs stomach as it slowly digested its own mess.<br />Sounds like REM?  not even if it was the end of the world as we knew it.
B000002I53|5.0|I just rented &quot;American Splendor&quot; over the past weekend, and noticed the title track from this record playing in the background on one scene. I've had this disc for a awhile but hadn't played it in years, but hearing that track made me go back and find it. The moody, Indian-influenced rendition of what would otherwise be a cheesy popular tune from long ago is just mind-blowing. I don't know how or why Trane picked that tune to make the centerpiece of this album, but he must have heard something in it that led to this. This is one of the greatest and most timeless jazz records of all, like &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth.&quot; It's right on the edge between experimentalism and accessability. It's a must for anyone even remotely interested in Trane. Buy it, and dig in!
B0000019PA|5.0|The people who are giving this record bad reviews are, I imagine, the kind of music fans that mistake complexity for quality. They scoff at simple melodies and straightforward production in an effort to show sophistication. Yet Aeroplane is only superficially simplistic; behind Magnum's drifting melodies is a rich amalgamation of different instruments that give this album a truly unique feel. The combination of singalong melodies with thick &quot;wall of sound&quot; backdrops creates a wonderful texture. It is one of the best produced albums I have ever heard, in that it suits the melody and lyrics perfectly. I never tire of listening to a single track.

B00005YUPO|2.0|My six-month-old and I had enjoyed a number of the Baby Einstein video titles, and the Baby Bach Concert for Little Ears was a naptime favorite. So the Baby Bach DVD seemed like a safe bet, and I bought it without looking at the reviews here. Mistake! I agree with the parents who were a little disturbed by the overexposure of little Aspen and Sierra, but I think the sound mixing bothered me even more. We'd seen the video several times before I could hear Sierra's riddle clearly enough to understand why those freakin' chickens keep showing up. (\\"Bach, Bach,\\" nyuck, nyuck.) They don't seem to bother Six-month-old, though, and neither does the shoddy digital editing that makes the robots look so pixelley to me. In short, Baby says thumbs up, Mom tries not  to pay attention when it's on.
B00006EXDM|5.0|The Rolling Stones were the original Bad Boys of rock.  The Beatles and other groups of the early and mid-60's had a clean-cut image that The Rolling Stones deliberately flaunted with their facial expressions, appearance, and blues-influenced music that lyrically was more challenging than most other popular contemporary groups.  The closest contemporary group to The Rolling Stones was Aerosmith, before they too became more commercial.  Now so many groups attempt to affect a bad boy image that the image has been watered down and no longer has much meaning.  But in the 60's, The Rolling Stones were the definition of rebellion and thinly veiled sexuality.<br /><br />This collection of hits recalls The Rolling Stones at their most rebellious and cutting edge.  In the still relatively proper (read Victorian-like) year of 1965 the song \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" bordered on being scandalous.  When the boys sang with their shirts open with movements that pushed beyond those of Elvis Presley, you knew that these lads were something different.  Later songs such as \\"Let's Spend the Night Together\\" pretty much threw the remnant of a veil away.<br /><br />As The Rolling Stones moved into the late 60s their music changed steadily, frequently anticipating the direction of music.  The ubiquitous sitar of psychedelic 60s music makes an incredible appearance in \\"Paint It, Black.\\"  Their music became heavily blues influenced in songs like \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" and \\"Wild Horse.\\"  The vocals on the last song particularly were heavy, plaintive and emotional, very different from The Stones' early music.<br /><br />There is an on-going debate over the value of this CD versus \\"40 Licks.\\"  I do not have \\"40 Licks,\\" which is also a fine CD.  Many of the songs on this CD are represented on \\"40 Licks.\\"  However, \\"40 Licks\\" seems to me to belie the original Stones bad boy image because of the inclusion of so many commercial songs from the later decades of their career.  \\"Hot Rocks\\" still provides the illusion of the original Bad Boy Stones at their 60s anti-establishment rebellious best.  \\"40 Licks\\" is too commercial for the bad boy image to be other than a commercial facade.  Understanding the flavor you get from each CD, pick the one that fits what you want to hear.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones were heavily influential in the 60s.  The music on this CD represents that influence, and shows The Rolling Stones during their most consistently creative and stylistically unique best.

B00008J4P5|4.0|As an initial matter, I should mention that I am a bit of a band-wagon-jumper with The White Stripes, initially having first seen the band about two years ago on the Late Late Show and finally letting curiosity get the better of me with their recent 5 Grammy nominations.  Having listened to the record only four or five times in the last week, I have to give it a 4-star rating.<br />The disk begins its march with &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, initially reminding me of those drudgy bass lines first promulgated by the likes of Black Sabbath.  (Wait a second, is that a bass?)   Although White Stripes is considered &quot;alternative&quot;, this song won the Grammy for 'Best Rock Song'.  This sound is so hot that I would not be suprised if the Grammy's tap them next year for the latest single/mega-video, &quot;The Hardest Button to Button&quot;.<br />The disk moves on to the punkish &quot;Black Math&quot; and one of the other highpoints of the record, the &quot;There's No Room for You Here&quot;, of which my significant other, on first listen, astutely observed its resemblance ot early-Queen.<br />From a band that gained notariety from its unique takes on cover tunes (e.g., &quot;Jolene&quot;), their affecting take on Burt Bacarach's &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself&quot; does not disappoint.<br />Of note for White Stripes fans is the LP introduction of Meg White on vocals, first on the haunting &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;, and then taking the role of Jack's sister in the country tri-et with English folk-popster, Holly Golightly, on &quot;It's True We're in Love&quot;.  (By the way, for those of you who did not catch the White Stripes' unauthorized documentary on DVD, Jack and Meg are divorcees, not brother and sister, as the myth goes.)<br />What strikes me most about this musical duo is the diversity on the record.  One second, you've got Zeppelin (&quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;) and the next minute, you've got folky ballads (&quot;You've Got Her inYour Pocket&quot;).<br />They may be a fad, but this is a damn good record.  Stripe me red and white.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Wicked is one of the best Cd I've ever heard since... Well ever!<BR>It has a All Star Cast and once you listen to it you will never stop! Buy this one, trust me!
B000068OSK|3.0|First off, as a new fan who grabbed all four of the White Stripes records within the scope of a week, I would advise anyone who has been weened on 'Elephant' (2003) or 'White Blood Cells' (2001) to get the other LPs first.  Their indie debut probably takes the most getting used to.<br />That said, the first two rockers, \\"Jimmy the Explorer\\" and a cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\", are like a breath of fresh air.  There are other hints of greatness here as well, including the power blues of \\"Suzy Lee\\", the acoustic blues of \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good\\" (the latter being a taste of what was to come with the follow-up record, 'De Stijl' (2000)), and the old-school blues (we're talking 1930s here) of \\"St. James Infirmary Blues\\".<br />The problem with the record is the one dimensional aspect - by the time you get to the third track, \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby\\", the novelty of Jack White running his voice through a guitar amp and the minimalism of Meg White's drumming starts to wear a bit thin.  But hey, it was their first record, they would learn . . .<br />For the new listener, I recommend trying out White Stripes in the following order: (1) De Stijl; (2) Elephant; (3) White Blood Cells; and (4) White Stripes.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce is a talented young women and her first solo CD is really good. I enjoy more than three songs on this CD and the duet with Luther Vandross is the BOMB!  With modern day technology and everyone being able to download or listen to music on the internet for free, Beyonce is obviously doing something right because she has sold MILLIONS of Dangerously in Love and has been in the top 10-20 for WEEKS...so I say let the record sales speak for themselves.  Congratulations Beyonce, on your 5 grammy win...you have worked really hard and you deserve every bit of it!
B00000J8EK|3.0|Since I first heard the Bros' debut \\"Exit Planet Dust\\" I liked their style. When I bought \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" I was even more delighted with their big beats and driving bass. So, it was a natural decision to buy \\"Surrender\\" as well. I can't say that was a mistake of mine, but it wasn't a big success either.<br />ChemBros moved away from their big rocking style to more old-school electronic music. Gone are the break-beats, instead there's a common 4/4 drum-machine. Gone are the driving bass-lines, instead there's a flowing monotonous bass. There's a lot of funky feeling to the tracks here. All of this together with guest vocals make something of a \\"return to 1985\\" feel to the record.<br />Well, I can understand that the Brothers wanted to stay clear of the copycats, or to tread some new ground, to develop. But this is not the music that I like. It's too tamed, fails to move me, and generally tends to just make background to some other activity. Boring? No, I wouldn't call it that, but it never excites like the \\"Block-Rocking Beats\\" or the majority of \\"Dig Your Own Hole\\" does. The Brothers' evolution has clearly made me part ways with them.
1881273156|5.0|Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love. ~Gary Chapman<br /><br />It is amazing how you will just have learned a lesson and then read it in a book, however, there are many lessons you don't want to learn five years from now. This book is filled with ideas on how you can immediately transform your relationship from a cold grave to a peaceful island resort. Perhaps you want to change your life into an amazing adventure or you want to calm the storms.<br /><br />Gary Chapman presents five love languages. One of these languages may be your primary love language, but he takes it further and explores the dialects of love. I think that many of us want all five languages, but there are various ways each can be expressed.<br /><br />Gary explains the five languages in detail and finally you will understand why some people don't respond to your gifts and others go wild with happy kitten joy. When you meet someone who shares your primary language it can feel like you have entered a magical country where everyone is speaking your language.<br /><br />For some individuals, \\"words of encouragement\\" will be much higher on their list than \\"the show of love through gifts\\" or \\"acts of service.\\"<br /><br />I had trouble deciding which language was my favorite, but I know I get a bit happy when I receive gifts. However, I noticed that I never complain about not receiving gifts. Gary actually made it easier to figure out when he started to talk about what you complain about most. I normally say: \\"You are not listening to me.\\"<br /><br />While I enjoy gifts, I'm never demanding in this area. So then I considered \\"Quality Time.\\" Bingo, I was very concerned about \\"Quality Conversation.\\" There is definitely \\"bliss\\" in \\"sympathetic dialogue.\\" This is actually a rare thing indeed. When you talk to people, most of the time they are more worried about what they are going to say next and when you find someone who actually listens to what you are saying and responds in a way that makes you feel understood, that is bliss.<br /><br />So, I was very happy to have discovered my primary love language and I also figured out why people in my life don't always respond to gifts in the way I think they would. Some do and they will be getting more boxes of homemade cookies, for sure. ;)<br /><br />Gary does bring out various aspects of love that make you realize that love is not just a happy feeling of infatuation. It was interesting to read about how long the initial bliss stage lasts in most relationships and then to read about the decline and divorce rates for first, second and third marriages.<br /><br />There are examples in this book that present great hope for marriages that have grown cold or are on the rocks. Even one partner can read this book and change their relationship.<br /><br />There is a study guide at the end of the book and the questions can be used at home or in a class setting.<br /><br />\\"The Five Love Languages\\" is an essential book for marriage counselors, couples and anyone who wants to figure out how their partner responds to various forms of love.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviews bliss.

B00005JMCT|4.0|I've never seen american pie 1 or 2 but i still thought this movie was great.
B00009V7RF|3.0|This is my first hip hop album thanks to extensive broadcasting of \\"where is the love\\", which is an easily acceptable tune for non hip hop listeners. If you've not experienced any hip hop record before, you may take this as a touchstone and I'm sure you will be gratified by most of the songs.<br />You may want to move your feet unconsciously in the first 15 minutes cause the album starts with consecutively heavy rhythms from track 1 to 4. Then here comes the \\"shut up\\" which starts another wacky-funky 10 minutes ends with \\"smells like funk.\\" Track 7 \\"latin girls\\" and track 8 \\"sexy\\" may be the most graceful period for those who bought this album for \\"where is the love.\\" Track 9 ~ 12 got it's own characteristics but not catchy too far, or I'll rate it four stars, then there's \\"where is the love\\" and one hilarious bonus track. <br />Well enough for my first trip on hip hop! Three stars is just the beginning.
B00008MNYS|4.0|I wonder if anyone is lacking in irony enough to accuse Robbie Williams of being ear candy... or lame enough to accuse people of accusing him of being ear candy.  Either way, this album is inconsistently wonderful, and even the low points are fun.  When I say low points, I just mean indistinct.  His voice is a wonderfully predictable mix of alternative and R &amp; B, and the production is perfectly clean and sterile.  You just want to sing along to everything and not feel any shame... except for that &quot;monkey&quot; song, which has too many words to remember. There is plenty of wit (&quot;Handsome Man&quot;), as there is plenty of lame (&quot;Handsome Man&quot;).  You'll play it constantly for a month, then get sick of it.  Then remember it 4 months later.  Give it a spin in your car with your arty Velvet Underground fan friends (if you know any), see them squirm.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The idea behind this movie is that a formerly great actor goes to Japan for $2 million to be in a Suntori whiskey commercial. He doesn't really put out any effort to make the commercials great and sort of comes across with the \\"I got the money and I'm not going to work hard to make any of this any good\\". That pretty much describes this movie. He got his money and sent his body to sit in for him in the movie, leaving any acting ability at home asleep.
B000002UJQ|5.0|You know an album is good when people are reviewing other people's reviews.  In order to properly absorb this album, I suggest that you listen to the album a few times, then go to [...] and look up each song and see a little bit about how it was written.  <br />This album is definitely worthy of the term epidemic masterpiece.  You listen to this album and decide you want to hear more stuff like it... then you hear more stuff like it and decide to appreciate this album on a deeper level when you listen to it again.  It's an album for someone with a sense of irony who knows who &quot;that guy&quot; is and has either been alienated or rejected or has at least seen it happen.  Strange metaphors that work on too many levels to be intentional at all times and some dark humor that make you examine your mental well being after you laugh.  I'd personally like to make this album a prerequisite for meeting me, but then I'd have surprisingly few friends.  There are so many levels to enjoy this on.  Best of all, it makes no attempt to cater the messages for Everyman.  You can relate to them if you wish.  Everyone else has surely written enough about their songs, but I just want to ask:  How is &quot;Airbag&quot; a song?  I don't get it.  It's like a few vocal line with an ever changing beat behind it with a random bassline and some random guitar parts.  Brilliant.
B00000JPH0|5.0|I give this film 5 stars not so much for its storyline or plot (which is virtually non-existant) but for its attempt to show a little known conflict.  The combat scenes in this movie are intense.  The waves of Soviet infantrymen throwing themselves upon the Mannerheim line gives the viewer a good idea what it must have been like for the Finns.  The production value of this film is superb.  Those are authentic Soviet T-26 light tanks, and early Yak Fighters.  Again, don't look at this movie if you want to see a human interest story or standard plot.  The intent of this work is docu-drama.  The film accurately shows what the Finns did to resist the Soviet onslaught of 1939-40.  There is not much character development here, pretty much all the Finns look like another, but what you see is a gritty determination of a small nation to defend itself against Stalin's tyranny.  In the end of course the Finns had to make unfortunate concessions, but few modern wars show a more inspiring image of a small determined people fighting for their survival.  This  film is worth looking at for its marvalous combat scenes, equippment, and sheer grit.  This is certainly a guys movie par excellenece.  If you are inspired by it you should read the fine recent history of the conflcit entitled &quot;A Frozen Hell&quot;
B0000C7PSW|5.0|...but it helps.  You can appreciate this album without absorbing or understanding a single word of it.  That's something that any good album exhibits.  Of course, Rufus' tired, mush-mouthed vocal delivery would mislead you to miss the energy and sarcasm in the words.  Actually, it seems that the theme of the album is being ambitiously tired of the modern world, but even if I am blatantly misinterpreting it, you are guaranteed to be humming at least one passage from this if you buy it.  The bombastic production is a blissful departure from what's been heard lately, as is Wainwright's vibrato. The sound may be occasionally repetitive, but it's too fascinating to fault him for.  But \\"Beautiful Child\\" is the best recorded musical moment in years.  That may be sound vague, but when you hear it you'll know, especially if you're a musician.  And there isn't a track on here that you wish wasn't.  Maybe this sort of thing can stick.  I'd like to see less wasted effort on modesty, and more wasted effort on wit and detailed dramatic production...<br />Oh yeah, just noticed there are a few reviewers who don't like his voice.  I'll try to say this politely... Please disregard those reviews, they represent a small, anal retentive percentage of the populus; and I have played Rufus to uniformly enthusiastic reviews from friends.
B0000YWKHC|1.0|This must be one of those films that people wasted their money watching and then wanting others to do the same. So they rated this boring movie high so others may want to see it and waste their money also. How sad. If people can really say they can identify with this movie, they must be really lonely and living a boring life. If wandering around a city looking out the window and looking bored is great acting, then this would be a great film.
B000002BBY|5.0|There's not a flaw on this album, but there's so much more than that. You just have to see for yourself.  I love when people misinterpret the Gallagher brother's rants and babbling, it shows how easily mislead people are.  These are the same two guys who had a heated argument about the difference between rock and roll mischief and soccer hooliganism.  How can you take their &quot;biggest band ever&quot; claim seriously?  And feel free to miss the point and write them off as Beatles rip-offs.  Mind you, this is just as true about EVERY band that came after 1963.<br />As for the actual music, there's not a dull moment here.  There are two instrumental tracks that combine for less than two minutes, and they are very well placed to give you time to absorb the previous song.  I don't know how intentional it is, but that's what happens.  &quot;She's Electric&quot; is one of the most charming songs I've ever heard, despite being the same chords as &quot;Digsy's Diner&quot; and &quot;Married With Children&quot; of their previous album.  I'd like to see any other band come together and make something this accessible.  The true test that only this album could pass:  Every single track has at least one part that could be made into an instantly recognizable cell phone ring tone.  As depressing as that could be, it's still brilliant.
B000002NHN|5.0|I came to Amazon this evening to replace my version of this CD. I have had this CD for about 5 years, and it would be suffice to say, I have worn it out. This is not the first or last time I will wear out a  favorite CD out. <BR>This is a lasting favorite.<br />I want to bring up something, I find particularily unique about Loreena McKennitt  music. It is the story of her journey that led to the actual song which make her CDs a bit different. The stories behind some of her music have insprired me to research historical events, look into different areas of religion, or culture. I attribute Loreena to my initial interest in John Ruskin and architecture. I have also read &quot;How the Irish Saved Civilzation&quot; by Thomas Cahill because of the CD liner notes. <br />The stories that go with the music are as fun as the final &quot;product&quot;. I love the journey.<br />I very recently became aware of a composer named Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance)-- Whale Rider songtrack and The Mirror Pool from which the song &quot;Savean&quot; was featured on a  recent West Wing episode. Excellent music. Lots of eastern musical influences, similar to Loreena, on The Mirror Pool CD. The song &quot;Savean&quot; is classic. <br />BUT my first reaction to the CD itself was-- &quot;Jeez, I wish I knew more about the inspiration behind these compositions.&quot; I was disappointed there were no stories to go with the songs.<br />As far as I know, Loreena is not scheduled to put out another CD before next year--2005. In the mean time I am exploring Dead Can Dance and Lisa Gerrard even if the stories and lyrics are lacking.
0385504209|5.0|When I tell my friends about this book I tell them it is like &quot;Crack&quot;...You can't get enough of it, and never want it to end.  I went nuts for this book.  It appeals to my interest in religious studies and history, but mostly it appeals to my escapist desire for an excellent mystery/thriller.<br />I've given three copies to friends in the last month.  When ever I find out someone is a reader, I ask &quot;have you read The DaVinci Code?&quot;  I'm gushing...hope you like it as much as I do.
0385510438|2.0|While Grisham's description of small town Southern America might make for an interesting read as a New Yorker piece, in this alleged 'mystery' novel, it becomes tedious and a bore. Has anyone born since 1960 not read or heard all of this before ?  <br />If the background patronizes us, then the plot insults.  Anyone moderately well read mystery reader will call this one about 100 pages before the finish line.  Mr. Grisham, take a year off.
B00003CXTF|1.0|This movie spent way too much time on the love story aspect. I had a hard time getting through it. I've seen thousands of movies and I would have to say the only thing that interested me in this ENTIRE movie would have to be the attack scenes. Even if it has the historical inaccuracies (which it soooo does) the battle scene was well played out.<br />Beyond that it's just not worth watching. If I could give this movie no stars I would.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I fell asleep thirty minutes into the movie, and woke up one hour later feeling like I didn't miss a thing.  While the actors displayed great character understanding, the dialogue (or lack of) and setting (weird Tokyo) left a feeling like the movie is without meaning.  I was sad that I wasted $20.00 on a movie that was hyped up too much.  I'm glad it landed Bill Murray a Golden Globe (finally!), but I also think he should have been recognized for other roles he has played in the past.
B00009V7P8|5.0|In a word filled with Top 40 bubble gum pop, it is so refreshing to still see that music like this exists.  This man not only has an amazingly beautiful voice, but is also a great song writer, a quality that seems to be hard to find in musicians these days.  Each song on this album has a haunting melody and it lingers with the listener even after the song is over.  It's very calming and the perfect type of music to come home to after a long day. This is a great CD and I truly look forward to more from this great man in the future.
B0000D96NW|2.0|With the exeption of a very few moments on this cd, there is absolutely no resemblence of any good Machine Head here. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because compared to The Burning Red and Supercharger, it is definately an improvement (Not sure if it was possible to get worse.)<BR>Rob Flynn again absolutely butchers any thoughts of decent vocals, and the lyrics are absolutely ridiculous. The bass work is good, but the drumming is again nothing new, and ultimately sub-par. It might have worked 5 years ago, but not now.<br />Their old guitarist gone (*whew*), Phil Demmel steps up with a vengeance. The guitar work on the cd is good, and even though Rob has no business singing, him and Phil mesh very, very nicely with some well composed playing.<BR>Bottom line: Dont buy it if you think it's going to be like Burn My Eyes, or even The More Things Change. You'll be as upset as me.
B00005JME0|5.0|i loved this movie. it is shocking , disturbing , creepy , and scary. quad threat.
0156027321|5.0|This book was a joy to read.  The mixture between religions and the commentary provided by Pi Patel was incredible.  He is so descriptive and so human; he tells you all of his doubts and his desires, the way he wants things to be.  What I noticed about this book the most though was how beautiful he made everything.  Even the most disgusting things were transformed into poetic objects of beauty.  His family owns a zoo, it's bound to be loud, noisy, and smelly, yet he makes you picture it as though you were there and could feel the animals, actually know what it was like to be in love and care for them.  <br />It was funny because I didn't know this book was fiction at first.  When you take it from that approach it's much different than reading it as fiction.  I liked it better from the non-fiction approach. It made his struggles more realistic and courageous.  The one part I didn't agree with though (in truthfullness) was the part about the island and the muskrats.  But that's for one to decide on one's own. ^^<br />This book on a whole was great.  Yann Martel has a great gift of writing and imagination.  His characters were well developed (Pi mainly) and the way he centralizes it around three different religions is a relief from the normal devout so-and-so faithful person.  Pi's genuine belief in these three religions was wonderful, making one think that maybe all the religions out there are somehow right.<br />I recommended this book to my boyfriend and my family.  There's a reason it has been on the bestsellers list for so long.  Read it and enjoy it - it's a nice bit of light reading that makes you think afterwards.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|For many years, the echelon of bad movies for me was Robin Hood:  Men in Tights.  Every movie I saw after that was measured by if it was better than that movie.  The combination of the once-great Mel Brooks being revealed for a hack, absolutely 0 laughs, and dull, leadfoot parody made every movie look better in comparision.  After years of certainty, a movie has come along that has set a new standard in badness.  That movie is The Matrix Revolutions.<br />The second one was bad, but at least, there was the hope that all questions would be answered, making this a decent two-picture story.  So what did the Wachowski brothers do?  They started by removing everything entertaining from the 1st one, like decent music, a comprehensible plot, and characters we cared about.  They answered no questions brought up in the second movie, apparently leaving it up to your imagination to fill in the gaps.  They tried to tell a story that did not conform to anything that had been previously set up.<br />My fervent hope is that no one will see this movie, and on that task, I have succeeded in persuading some from attending.  If you absolutely must see it, rent it after the 1st month...but don't say that I didn't warn you.  And thanks, Wachowski Brothers, for setting a new standard that will be hard to overcome.
B00005U11Z|5.0|I can't believe how many &quot;new-Steve haters&quot; there are that hardly give this dvd a chance just because there's no Steve Perry. This dvd has perfect sound and picture quality. The video editing is perfect. The camera angles do not jump around every half second like a lot of live dvds these days. It's edited exactly the way all concert dvds SHOULD be. As if it's a live broadcast on TV. No MTV style editing. <BR>The perfomance is outstanding. Sure, the new Steve sounds a lot like the old Steve, but what's wrong with that? What if they got a singer who sounded completely different? A lot of bands who replace singers usually end up with someone who totally sucks, but obviously Journey was very careful about their choice. The new Steve sounds great live. He doesn't seem to have as much running around the stage energy that the old Steve had, but in no way does that make the performance worse. Deen Castronovo (did I spell that right?) does a great job on the drums. I'm not that familiar with his past, but I do know he plays drums on a couple songs on the Working Man Rush tribute cd. But he makes Journey drummers of the past look like Meg from White Stripes. He rips through the entire show perfectly. Plus does some backing vocals! Neal's guitar playing improves every time they tour. And of course Ross and Jonathan are also great. There's no reason any true Journey fan should not like this dvd. If you're just whining because there's no Steve Perry, then remember this: what if they got someone like Peter Steele from Type O Negative to sing for Journey? Or ANYONE who doesn't have a similar sound to Steve Perry?  I thing Journey make the perfect choice.
0671027573|5.0|Oh my, I absolutely loved this book. It was wonderful. I laughed, then I cried, then I laughed some more, then I cried... Yes, this book was amazing.<br />I wish I knew where I could find some big, strong hunky guy with bulging muscles, sense of humour, oozing with sexuality AND intelligence to boot. Is there such a guy?? Probably not, but I can always read this book to find him.<br />Jaine and her three friends get together and make up this \\"list\\" describing what the perfect guy should be. This list is completely thorough and very disturbing to some insecure men. Unfortunately, this list falls into the wrong hands and suddenly ignites a media frenzy over this controversial list. Bad news is, a psycopathic madperson is on the loose and he is not happy. Luckily for Jaine, her gorgeous neighbor Sam, is none other than a police detective.<br />The chemistry between Jaine and Sam is sizzling. This is not just a romantic novel, but it is an intriguing thriller. The ending will shock most people, it certainly did me. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and recommend it wholeheartedly.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|&quot;Underworld&quot; was a very interesting film to watch. Part horror/action film, this film manages to have a interesting and original storyline, fine cinematography and a good performance by Kate Beckinsale. Despite its strengths, it sometimes lacks &quot;bite&quot;.<br />In a film inspired by THE MATRIX and THE CROW, this movie easily seperates itself from because it's about vampires and werewolves. The storyline has the two battling an ancient war for over a 1000 years. Vampire hunteress Selene(Beckinsale) rescues a ill-fated human named Michael(Scott Speedman) from Lycans, a.k.a werewolves. She then stumbles upon a conspiracy by the Lycans, who have turned Michael into one of them, in order to exterminate the vampires. Selene struggles to keep Michael from becoming a Lycan, but gets help from an ancient vampire, Victor, who isn't all he seems. Then of course there's a battle between the two races.<br />I liked the story, but this film just plays by the numbers. This film has a dark and gloomy atmosphere, which I like, yet the film fails to be more gritty. Horror fans will be dissapointed with the lack of blood this film offers, but many may be glad with just the story, which has surprising twists and turns. The special effects aren't all that special, since there's nothing groundbreaking about it. The action wasn't really productive either, just grade B stuff. I felt sometimes this really was a low budget actioner, but it's still stylish now and then. <br />&quot;Underworld&quot; was a film basically filled with a bunch of familar ideas which rewrites what we think of vampires and werewolves. But I just didn't get what this film said to me, because I just wasn't all that excited what it had to offer. Despite some strengths, &quot;Underworld&quot; was a very mixed movie to watch.
B0000DJZAH|5.0|&quot;This album stinks!&quot;- Can you do better, Mr. Auburn?<br />&quot;the singing and playing on it are terrible!&quot;- You need a capital letter at the beginning of each sentence.<br />&quot;This is the worst album ever made!&quot;- That and every other classic rock album you reviewed.  We really need &quot;talented&quot; people like Britney Spears and Janet Jackson who ripped off America's &quot;Ventura Highway&quot; to show us what real music is all about.<br />&quot;Thank God the 1970's are over!&quot;- I notice you put this on every review you written.  By the way, Tommy came out in 1969, not in the 1970's.  I guess you're glad that year is over, too, eh?
B00012QM8G|5.0|It is hard to state the importance of this film, either socially or morally, but to call it anything less than that would be a mistake. Schindler's List was not the kind of film I had at first expected to come from Steven Spielberg, having grown up with E.T. and Close Encounters. To say that I was surprised by the power of this film would be a gross understatement, never before I have found myself so moved by a work of cinema. The subject matter is so disturbing, the images haunt you long after the film has ended and Spielberg's use of black and white is a stark contrast to what we expect from movies today. If there is any movie that I would recommend, any film that I would beg my friends and family to witness... it is Schindler's List. It will stand throughout the ages as a testament to the horrors of the Holocaust, and the power that we each, as individuals, have to change the world even in the face humanity's worst. With a little help, and powerful reminders like this, maybe one day we truly will make certain that such a horrific act will never again take place.

B00015HVI8|5.0|Having watched the series from its beginnings on Showtime, I can honestly say that the blending of sci-fi and mythology is one of the best I have ever seen.  Season 6, having aired on Sci-fi channel as opposed to Showtime, I was leery of what they might do to the already well formed storylines, but was pleasantly surprised at the production quality and continuation of the storyline.  Though the story as of late hasn't been up to par with the rest of the series, it is still a lot better than anything out there for sci-fi fans.  For the disillusioned fans of Star Trek (due to the horrible Enterprise series), I recommend the entire series and the new episodes on the Sci-fi channel.
B000002KYK|5.0|Do you know how some times you feel like reaching in and slapping people on the Internet?  Well, that is how I feel when I read all the criticism of this CD.  You &quot;purists&quot; out there than lambasted this album need to go get a grip on yourselves, it is a damn good soundtrack!  For those of us that were around in 1982, it was the only soundtrack available for this great movie and I bought it on cassette (remember those?!?) after seeing Blade Runner.  The music mesmerized me, I don't know how but it equaled the impact that the movie had on me.  Back then we didn't know that Vangelis was having a hissy fit and wouldn't release his version of these songs for another dozen years.  No, we were grateful for the wonderful music that was a part of this magnificent film.<br />OK, I'll admit I was overjoyed when the Vangelis version came out...I actually picked mine copy up in Sarajevo, Bosnia!  Yes, it too is a wonderful piece of work, and one I have listened to over and over again.  I do like the voice overs from the movie, much like I liked the original (non-director's cut) of the film.  I also liked that the Vangelis version had more songs on it.  But does that mean I no longer like the New American Orchestra version.  Hell no!  If you truly loved the music from this great film, then buy both!  You will not be disappointed in either.  We are actually very fortunate to have both on CD, here are two different but excellent soundtracks for one of the best science fiction movies ever made.  They are relatively cheap and I assure you that you will get your money's worth out of both.
0061015725|4.0|Michael Crichton has produced another high-tech page-turner that will hold your interest to the very end.  You might call it Andromeda Strain meets Jurassic Park since the human-engineered malevolence is at the microscopic level in the form of nanoparticle-sized machines that have escaped from their laboratory and begun reproducing at an alarming rate.<br />The narrator of this adventure, Jack Forman is an expert in distributed programming.  Only now his career has been interrupted by some Silicon Valley backstabbing and innuendo, shifting him into a Mr. Mom role that's no all to all unpleasant save for the suspicion that his newly workaholic wife might be having an affair.  Her job involves a secret Defense project that is trying to create molecule-sized machines for intelligence gathering.  The trouble is, something has gone wrong with the project and Jack's been enlisted to help fix it.  That might sound simple but the tiny nano-machines have evolved into an independent form of life that seems ill-disposed to share space with mammals like rabbits, coyotes... and humans.<br />Crichton's appeal has always been his ability to build an exciting plot around a basic theme of technology exceeding the control of it's inventors.  This is vintage Crichton, not one of his best, but far from his lesser efforts.  He does a better job than usual though, in controlling his urge to educate the scientifically illiterate, limiting his dissertations on next-generation programming and molecular science to only a few paragraphs at a time, rather than going on for pages at a time.  He has also developed more of a flair for characterization, creating a cast that with more emotional and relational range than in many of his previous books.<br />Maybe he does telescope the ending just a bit, but by the time you've confirmed your suspicions as to where the story is heading, you've still had a thoroughly enjoyable ride.
B0001906O0|4.0|If you were a diehard fan of the Cure and wanted to listen to their b-sides and rare tracks, you had mainly two options: listen to the original vinyl/CD single or grab the \\"Standing on a Beach\\" cassette, which had a bonus selection of early b-side cuts.  \\"Join the Dots\\" now makes things easier for the fan who's got to own every hard-to-find release by the Cure.  On 4 CDs, the band covers their 23-year discography of rarities, and all the tracks are digitally remastered under the supervision of Robert Smith.  The first disc is a virtual trip down memory lane and it's easily the best, featuring songs that trace back to the Cure's punk roots.  Notable gems are \\"I'm Cold,\\" \\"Another Journey by Train,\\" the orchestral \\"A Few Hours After This,\\" and \\"Throw Your Foot.\\"  The second disc covers 1987-92, and by this point, the band found a mainstream audience in America.  Its twin peaks are the poppy \\"2 Late\\" and the dark and atmospheric \\"Fear of Ghosts,\\" which stands as good a track as anything off their 1989 album \\"Disintegration.\\" Another highlight is a respectable cover of the Doors' \\"Hello, I Love You,\\" and three versions of this song are found.  Disc 3 covers 1992-1996, with some good tracks (\\"Play\\" and \\"This Twilight Garden\\") and some notable misfires, such as a cover of Hendrix's \\"Purple Haze\\" and a not-bad-but-pointless cover of Bowie's \\"Young Americans.\\"  The fourth disc, which covers 1996-01 finds the group experimenting with electronica with varying degrees of success.  It's not a bad disc, and much of the stuff on here is good, but it's my least favorite among the four.  Tracks that make it worth the trip are the Palmer remix of \\"This is a Lie,\\" the Oakenford remix of the \\"Bloodflowers\\" cut \\"Out of this World,\\" an acoustic version of \\"Signal to Noise,\\" and the beautiful \\"More Than This\\" (which, by the way, is NOT a cover of the Roxy Music classic).  All in all, \\"Join the Dots\\" is a no-questions-asked must buy for Cure diehards like myself, but first-timers who are green to the band should start with their studio albums first.  For those who have been longing to get these tracks on CD, this is more than a box set.  It's also an answered prayer.reen to the band should start with their studio albums first.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|It fascinates me that people 'waited for something to happen' in this movie. Waited for what? The steamy sex scene?  The car chase?  The explosion? The espionage? What really HAPPENED is that two people slowly and maybe a little begrudgingly fell in love with each other. End of story.  It's a little scary that there are folks who think that means 'nothing happens'.  I agree with other reviewers, head out to the multiplex and see the shoot-em-ups, and leave something a little more cerebral to the rest of us.  Loved, loved, loved this movie.  There is one scene where these two find comfort in each other with just a small touch between them that is immensely moving, and way more sensual than anything I've seen for a while.
B0000AQZYM|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I haven't even seen this, and I already know it is a piece of corporate trash. I actually got a mini preview of it by hearing a cassette dramatization, one of Disney's usual props to sell it's videos. It's humor is too grown-up, sophisticated, and ultimately, gross, for children. It is what you would find in a movie like American Pie, or some other less sexual teenage flick, only slightly dumbed down for children. I can't see the animation, so I have no comments to make on that. I actually like Albert Brooks' character, but he was about all that saved this from being utterly stupid and unbearable. The story line is unbelievably formulaeic, even more so than some of Disney's other efforts. I'm not even going to explain it, since the abundance of reviews here make the main plot elements clear. The characterization is cardboard, no, make that paper-flat and uninteresting, except for the sympathetic Marlin. The humor is disgustingly subpar, as I've said, it's toilet humor for children. Really, people. Do we actually want to teach our kids these kinds of things are funny? I'd never thought I'd see the day when Disney had to resort to almost swearing in it's movies to hold children's interests. That is absolutely unforgivable. And referring to a volcano as an invitation to produce phlegm? My, how pathetic! Personally, I don't find it ammusing in the least.

B00009V7T2|5.0|When I first heard Cedric and Omar had formed another band, I wasn't expecting anything like Tremulant EP. That is how to begin a post-At the Drive-In era like any geniuses would do. The follow-up LP is a mind-blowing, revolutionnary and more than all, a masterpiece of contemporary music. This album pushes actual music borders to another level. At any second, during your first listening (when you don't know the songs), anything...like anything can happen. Only the great Frank Zappa and bands like Tool created that impression on me before. Hail to one of the most important bands on the planet!<br />Secondly, I'd like to disaprove that crap guy from Norflok who made a review on January 21st 2004. Dude, what have you got for ears? Sparta sounds like At the Drive-In (close to copy, but still ok) but At the Drive-In had it all. The intensity of that band, all the adrenalin they spitted on your face...close to geniuses. You have to admit they helped music being something more, something else. And, by the way, what are you expecting for the next 2 years? With 80ies fashion coming back (yukkkkkkkkkkkk), maybe all you want is another Queen? another Motley Crue? another Green Jelly?<br />Yummy...How cuuuuuute. I'm already licking my lips in delight...
0807219533|5.0|12-year-old Nathaniel lives in a fantastical London in which the ruling class are all magicians; as is the tradition, his parents sold him as an apprentice magician when he was only 6.  He lives in the attic of his master's house, unloved by everyone except Mrs. Underwood, his master's wife.  Seeking revenge for past humiliations, he instructs his djinn (genie) Bartimeus to steal a magic amulet from Simon Lovelace, the most powerful magician in London.  Thus begins a Mission-Impossible type adventure to prevent Lovelace from recovering the amulet and using it in a grand, take-over-the-world type of evil scheme.<br />If you have been resisting Bartimeus because it sounds like a Harry Potter wannabe, don't-read it now.  Although the parallels are obvious--a world of magicians, an orphan apprentice battling a supreme evil--the author is not out to mimic Potter but to offer a different and more pessimistic vision of what a magical world would be like.  In Harry Potter's world, magicial ability is a sort of genetic artifact; there are good, evil, and silly magicians - just as in the `human' world; and themes of the importance of family and friends predominate.<br />Bartimeus' vision is much, much darker.  Nathaniel lives in a world where magicians are a dominating ruling class, who thirst for wealth and power, and who will stop at nothing to get it.  But all their power stems not from innate ability but from the ability to control the spirits (genies, imps, and the like) that populate the natural world.  Here, the wizards are always on the edge of disaster created by losing control over these spirits.  One word wrong in an incantation means disaster!  There are no beneficent Dumbledore-like wizards here; all - and this includes Nathaniel - are driven by personal gain, revenge, and anger.<br />For all its darkness, author Jonathan Stroud has crafted an extremely well-paced and exciting book.  Get past the first 40 pages or so and you won't be able to put it down until youfind out just what evil Lovelace is up to and whether Nathaniel will be able to stop him.  The ending is deliciously ambiguous - not all the villains are captured; a mysterious Resistance seems to be forming among the non-magical humans; Nathaniel may succumb to his own lust for power; and the sarcastic and clever djinn Bartimeus seems likely to reappear in future volumes.  As Bartimeus is the first volume of the \\"Amulet of Samarkand\\" trilogy, surely there is more excitement to come.<br />Not, however, for people who thought that Harry Potter was dark or scary - if Harry disturbed you, this one will keep you checking under the bed at night and sleeping with the lights on.
B000001ELB|2.0|So, you need a Kiss &quot;greatest hits&quot; package and figured you'd take a look at this, their first such effort.  Okay, then, but be warned:  like most hits records, this one was prompted by the COMPANY and not the band itself, which makes its worth dubious at best.  Anyway.  If you like the classic-era Kiss material to the exclusion of all else, this set will make you happy.  I wore the grooves off of my original Double Platinum albums from so much heavy listening, so it's obviously quite an enjoyable mix.  It was only later that I really questioned what was going on with some of the tunes.  &quot;Strutter '78&quot; was cool at the time, but it became painfully obvious it was remixed/re-recorded to achieve a more disco sound.  Many of the other tunes featured this kind of unnecessary twiddling:  &quot;Detroit Rock City,&quot; &quot;Calling Dr. Love&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot; among them.  Then there's the inevitable problem of trying to get the non-Ezrin produced stuff to sound right with the Destroyer material.  Ezrin always recorded all his effects right onto the master tape, so making his stuff match the Kerner/Wise and Kramer material is only mildly successful.  Again:  if you ONLY like the original quartet, go ahead with Double Platinum.  If you want a wider range of years, without the odd remixed tunes, better go with the newest hits package, or splurge on the Box Set.
B00005JLR6|5.0|For sheer catharsis, In America beats every movie I've seen since \\"The Sweet Hereafter\\" years ago.  Like that movie, it deals with the aftermath of the death of a child; unlike that movie, it comes down (after much agony) on the side of a loving family as the only thing that can heal us.  <br />The Sullivans, a young couple with two adorable daughters, slip illegally into the U.S., moving to New York. In theory this is to help Da start his acting career; in reality, it is an attempt to escape from the sad memories of young son Frankie, recently died at 5 of a brain tumor.<br />The performances are all, all stunning. Samantha Morton, her hair shorn like a penitent nun's, gives a stunning performance driven by the despair in her eyes.  The real-world sisters Sara and Emma Bolger seem completely transparent; they leave the impression they are not acting at all, but really living the loss of their beloved brother.  The African actor Djimon Hounsou looms like a sad but powerful diety over the sorrowful family, alternatively reflecting their pain and offering them solace.<br />The ending will surprise you - I won't give it away here - but it is a sweet resolution.  The film seems to have a basis in truth, as it is written by director Jim Sheridan and his two daughters, and dedicated at the end to the memory of Frankie Sheridan (who, as it happens, was Jim Sheridan's brother rather than his son).
B000005RV8|5.0|When they put this together, they left just 5 album tracks off the list.  That's pretty complete.  Once again, just the 1st printing of this CD comes with the bonus disc.

B00003CXA2|5.0|Yesterday I've seen this movie for the first time and it automatically became one of my favorites. <BR>Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a man always oppressed by others because of his disabilities, but to be oppressed and with disabilities doesn't mean you have to turn into a loser and forget about the miracles life offers in daily basis. Forrest, tells the best example of all by sharing his stories from the bus stop bench he's sitting on.<BR>This movie, will make you laugh out loud but there are times when this movie makes you sob silently too. <BR>There are no such words as to describe what this movie really is.<BR>You must see it yourself if you didn't so far.
B000002NBY|5.0|This album is simply brilliant.<br />It is perhaps necessary to understand a small dosage of history when listening to this CD. Paul Simon went to South Africa during the apartide in order to record an album which he was hoping would be fresh with new and exciting culutural overtones. He succeeded, but I digress. Anyway, he received much criticism for it, but it sooned waned when the album sold tremendously well.<br />Basically, this album is not too much like anything else you will hear. And yet, it is very listenable and instantly likable. The very first track, &quot;The Boy in the Bubble&quot;, is a catchy ode to the amazing new technological and cultural advances of the time, displayed as a catchy shuffle. This is followed by what is perhaps my favorite track on the album, Graceland. The lyrics tell a story of a rather average man attempting to escape his past problems by traveling with his son to Memphis, TN.<br />Among these two is a slew of other amazing tracks, such as Gumboots, where Simon simply babbles out the odd details of his day. The African influence can be found heavily in all songs, but none more than &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes&quot;, which is begun by a powerful accapella [sic] introduction. Aside from it's miraculous ability to get stuck in your head, Simon shows us all how wonderful he is when it comes to phrasing. His lyrics are written and sung perfectly. At times they may seem free or even humorous, and at others sad and lamenting. The first example I found right of the bat that stuck out to me was in the first track, when Paul sings &quot;...the boy in the bubble and the baby with the baboon heart.&quot; The alliteration is almost breathtaking.<br />If the album were to have any flaws, I would say it would be that there are times when the mixing could be a little more desirable, though I'm not about to gripe. Also, the beginning songs are so amazingly good, that it takes a while for you to warm up to the latter tracks. Though like before, no biggy. As a whole, this album delivers perfectly. It stands on its own as a testament to cultural fusion between African tribal rythms and chants, and traditional American folk music. Well done Mr. Simon. Well done.
6304288433|3.0|With the happy tones from The Cordettes' \\"Mr Sandman\\", the second Halloween film sets off. We are taken back to the same night as before, in a film that was meant to conclude the story. <br />The mood is a bit darker in this film than in the first one. Expectations about a good time on Halloween have changed into fear and sorrow after the murders. News reports about the murders, that interrupt the TV-film (\\"The Night of the Living Dead\\") and on the radios, makes sure that no one misses what has happened. Dr. Loomis is, if possible, even more pessimistic about Michael Myers' nature. If he wasn't, in a moral sense, fully human in the first film, he is not even physically really human in this one. Adding to this dark mood, the action takes place only at night this time.<br />Since the film literally starts where the first ended (or two minutes before it ended), there is not much build-up. From the beginning Michael is out to kill people, and instead of building up a horror mood, we start with such a mood that only intensifies as the film continues. This also means that the new characters don't get to be intruduced so much. Although there are many side-characters the important ones are those from the first film: Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode. Laurie Strode is at the hospital, having some dream about her childhood, and Dr. Loomis is out with the police looking for Michael Myers, following every new lead. In this film Michael is not content with knife stabs and strangulations, which makes the film a bit more gory, but not more scary. <br />Musically we hear the same tunes as in the first film, but often with a more synthetic sound (the turn of the eighties is to blame for that). The mood setting interludes from the first film are mostly lacking, which makes the film a bit too intense to last one hour and a half. The fact that this was meant to be the end of the story (obvious from the fact that Halloween III has a totally different story) may make up for some of the film's weaknesses. This is, after all, the conclusion of the Halloween saga.

I guess labeling something Prog these days is like putting an NC-17 on a movie, an industry kiss of death. <br />I found my 15 year old hip-hop loving niece listening constantly to this CD so I loaded her down with my Rush, Marillion, Fish and Queesnryche CD's and she's now a dedicated Prog fan.. <br />This little old Prog band from Little Rock has a bright future..

0321127420|3.0|Overall, I was disappointed by this book. I develop business applications, and I was hoping this book would provide practical insights about such applications, more specifically in the database/web realm. While this book does contain some interesting pieces of information, it really is not of immense value to a developer such as myself. Here's why:<br />This book is a bit of a mishmash of different topics, but the vast majority of it (I'd say 75% or more) consists of ideas for object-relational mapping. Since most developers would use existing tools for object-relational mapping (in the Java realm, see Hibernate, JDO, etc.), I fail to see the real usefulness of this book for most developers building business (web) apps. Further, this kind of book encourages people who don't have the necessary expertise to try rolling their own OR mappers, which is simply not a good idea.<br />It's too bad, because the book starts off promisingly enough with 3 general approaches to business apps: Transaction Script: The procedural/transactional approach; Domain Model: The OO approach; and Table Module: The data-cetric approach. So far so good. Unfortunately the book then seems to steer off to the topic of \\"Fun With OR Mapping.\\" It's not as sexy, but I think that's perhaps what the title of this book should have really been! The book then goes on to talk about different ways to architect Web applications, again mostly getting into how to develop framework code, which one largely would take for granted if one is deciding which framework to use rather than rolling one's own. Finally the book talks a bit about locking strategies (pessimistic, optimistic) and then presents a few generic items (e.g. the concept of a Money class or a Registry class).<br />Only a very small fraction of this book will be useful to a non-framework developer. Also, even though this book claims to be technology-agnostic, it seems rather firmly planted in the Java world. I'm not convinced an ASP/ADO.NET developer would find it particularly useful, for example. I think there is an important need to demonstrate how to put together solid business applications. I'd love to see a book of recipes that says \\"here's how to develop an ASP/ADO.NET app; here's how to develop using EJB; here's how to develop using Hibernate...\\" but without all the distracting details of how to implement the whole solution from scratch -- Basically I want a book that relies on the idea that frameworks are out there, but focuses the developer on how to choose a framework and how to take advantage of frameworks to produce solid, maintainable solutions.<br />Lastly, I would say Core J2EE Patterns from Sun Press is a more useful book for the Java/J2EE crowd, though it too suffers from framework-itis.r would find it particularly useful, for example.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I could spend a ton of time criticizing those who give this wonderful film a one star rating, but I'll forgo pointing out their shortcomings as movie fans. This movie isn't made for them, I don't except them to like it. <br />Sofia Coppola has finally stepped at least partially out of her fathers shadow. She has shaped a small but excellent cast into a top-notch movie, one of the best of the year. The characters are not able to (or maybe they have no desire to?) interact much with their foreign surroundings, so this movie can focus on the characters themselves, and their interactions with each other. The blossoming friendship (...romance?) is the main focus of the movie, and it is very entertaining to see it unfold. <br />This movie gets my highest recommendation. Some won't like it, and its subject matter won't appeal to others. But for most people, Lost in Translation will be a very worthwhile experience.
0783226063|1.0|I was really excited to discover that besides the sci fi version of Dune there was an earlier version as well. That excitement quickly evaporated as I actually watched the film. In the end I had to give up about half an hour before the end of the film because it is completely unwatchable.<br />It's not the effects - I was expecting them to be dated, and surprisngly they weren't *that* dated. The look of the sandworm was captured well and I have no complaints there. It's everything else that needs correcting. There are of course the obvious things: Paul was cast too old,  everyone speaks in this weird staccato rhythm that makes them seem as though they're acting, for some reason the Bene geserrit reverand mothers are all bald even though in the book they clearly have hair, they made the barron diseased in a way he wasn't described in the book. But even these things could have been overlooked if they had gotten the feel of the story right - and they didn't. <br />Paul comes off like a sullen spoiled son of a duke, instead of the insightful precocious young adult he is portrayed in the book. The importance of the spice isn't too clear, neither are its effects on people who consume it. Just how dry Arrakis is, isn't made clear - the stilsuits have no hoods just nose plugs as though one could afford to lose moisture from one's mouth and facial skin on a planet such as Dune!?  In general the things which should be hi-lighted are glossed over, those which could be ignored are brought into such prominence as to obscure the overall point of the story. <br />The only things of interest are the appearance of Start Trek's (and  X-Men's) Patrick Stewart as Gurney, and Sting as Feyd.

B004SIP6QI|3.0|I thought COLD MOUNTAIN was supposed to be a moving romantic love story set against the back drop of the Civil War. For a romance, there really isn't much romance and the Civil War is the back drop and that's all it is in this movie, a back drop. There was so much drama during the Civil War I guess the creators of the film just didn't want to add to it. I don't know.<br /><br />Then there's the acting. I'll give the film's stars credit, they tried. However, their performances just don't mix. Nicole Kidman was miscast in this movie and though she tried her best, she just doesn't fit the part of a Southern belle forced to turn hardened working woman. Jude Law seems a little more realistic, but it's only because his pretty-boy faced is hidden behind a full beard or blood and dirt most of the time. In the few scenes we see him clean-shaven, he seems horribly miscast as well. Fortunately, the saving features of this catastrophe are the supporting actors and actresses. Renee Zellweger steals every scene she is in and totally outshines Kidman. Then there's the wonderfully talented Philip Seymour Hoffman who outshines Law in the few scenes they share. Finally, there is the brief turn by Natalie Portman as a young widow with a baby--her character says more about love and war than the rest of the movie combined.<br /><br />I'm not for sure what Anthony Minghella was trying to do with COLD MOUNTAIN, but that guy should have stuck to writing European fairy tales and mysteries because when it comes to American historical fiction, he just can't hack it.<br /><br />I found COLD MOUNTAIN to be very long and drawn out. The film was filled with scenes of unnecessary nudity. Besides that, when Kidman and Law's characters were on screen together, they just didn't seem to be the soul mates that they were supposed to be: their one passionate kiss says more about lust than love. Anyway, COLD MOUNTAIN is supposed to be based on Homer's THE ODYSSEY. If you want to see film that truly is based on THE ODYSSEY, watch O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? The time will fly by and you'll get a better glimpse at what an epic journey is really about. As for COLD MOUNTAIN, it's just too much fluff and not enough substance.ed on THE ODYSSEY, watch O'BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?

B0000U5RO4|4.0|As a recent convert to the humor of Mr. Bean, I was curious to see how Rowan Atkinson would be in a character other than Mr. Bean.  In JOHNNY ENGLISH, Atkinson does just that playing a bumbling MI agent who is out to stop an evil Frenchman from inheriting the British crown.  This isn't a raunchy spoof of spy movies like the AUSTIN POWER films. Instead, it's more like a comical homage.  JOHNNY ENGLISH reminded me more of Inspector Gadget than Austin Powers and Atkinson's portrayal made me think of a younger Don Knotts.  The film is quite funny and amusing and is much better than the trailers would leave one to believe. It has just the right mix of comedy and action and has a script better than even some Bond flicks. Cheers.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Being a fan since the 80's, I missed the three years since her last tour.  This CD was well worth the wait.  It brought back memories from her earlier years.  It gave me the same feeling that I got when Touch came out.  Sarah, you fail to disappoint me.  Afterglow is a CD I would recommend to all.
B0000CFW87|2.0|I am disappointed with this album, but not nearly as disappointed as I am with the vituperative nonsense that has been expressed by previous reviewers on both ends of the spectrum.  Let's review this album on artistic merit rather than relying on cheap attacks like &quot;crap&quot; or &quot;NPR crowd&quot;.<br />Josh Groban's voice came to my attention after he sang at the Tanglewood Music Festival in the Berkshires last summer with the Boston Pops Orchestra.  It certainly did suit his voice, in that the Pops tend to err on the side of over-emoting: some might say, at the cost of artistic sensibilities.  Many of the vocal students there were, understandably, dismissive of this crossover effort.  From there, Josh has turned up everywhere, from playing in the gift shop of the National Cathedral in Washington DC to the $500 answer on Jeopardy! to the Super Bowl pre-game show.  Certainly, one cannot argue with the exposure he has gotten.<br />Josh Groban's CD, Closer, is an extension of his self-titled first effort.  He has yet to stretch fully in challenging his voice, either by singing the true heavyweight pieces of the classical baritone repertoire or by singing more vocally difficult pop songs.  Instead, Closer stays very near to the safety of his first album.  The soaring &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; never quite makes it to the top notes (which felt a touch under-pitch each time), and his technique cannot cover the scooping that goes into the beginning of each phrase.  Admittedly, scooping is a stylistic preference, one which I happen not to like very much.  Classical virtuoso Joshua Bell lends an enormous amount of 'Classical Street Cred' to this album, and it is he, not Groban, who really carries the theme to &quot;Il Postino&quot;.  I was disappointed with the producers' flair for the melodramatic, as it truly did cover up much of Mr. Groban's vocal aspirations, as in the tracks \\"Caruso\\" and \\"Oceano\\".  One gets the sense that Josh might have done better releasingthis album 'naked' as in the Beatles' most recent release.<br />What it comes down to is this: Josh Groban's musicality has yet to expand into more challenging repertoire.  When he does, I get the feeling that it will be less successful than the safety he has come to know.  The melodramatic production of this album distracts from whatever artistry may be hidden underneath layers and layers of musical makeup (applied, if I may, a bit like Tammy Faye's eyeshadow).  And Josh Groban's own voice is one which is powerful and more suited to a huge Broadway production number: he seems miscast in this ersatz-Bocelli role into which he has been positioned.
0440180295|5.0|Without question, Kurt Vonnegut is among that small group of America's greatest 20th Century writers and, also without question, SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is his masterpiece.<br />The title refers to the location where his anti-hero, Bill Pilgrim, is held as a prisoner of war in Germany during World War II, a location that formerly had been, yes, a meat slaughterhouse.<br />S-5 makes for painful reading, but reading that at the same time is rich with insight. The scenes describing the bombing of Dresden are as vivid as anything ever written.<br />SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE is a powerful work which should be on every literate person's short-list of \\"must reads.\\"
B000003TAR|5.0|Hard rock, great radical poetry<br />'Nevermind' fanaticism may have contributed to its success, but I'm sure the being radical of its rock form was the catch. <br />Being different and original is still the best. Someone said its garbage, he/she is conventional, I understand him/her.<br />Kurt Cobain, we miss you.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I just had the honor of seeing this show on Broadway, and let me tell you it was the most amazing and brilliant thing i have ever seen in my life. This CD is a must have! Idina and Kristin's voices are incredible and literally made my jaw drop at some points. CD highlights are Defying Gravity and No Good Deed. Don't hesitate to buy this CD, the sonsg will be stuck in your head for ages, and you won't regret it!
B000001FA4|4.0|Alot of hype surrounded '' The Unforgettable Fire '', after the commercial success of '' War''. U2 were tagged the next big thing and went onto prove that,but not with the c.d. Yes it was a good album, but I`m not sure it was a classic. Some nice songs here,but there were some duds too. Elvis Presley In America in my mind completely missed the mark, as did M.L.K. 4th July an unnecessary inclusion too,but there were some gems. The haunting title track was a pearler, as was Wire, Indian Summer Sky, and the gorgeous A Sort Of Homecoming, but that was about it. I did like Pride at the time, but it was overplayed in it`s day and <BR>began to grate. Bad went onto become a popular live song, however it never really grabbed me either. All in all it was a nice <BR>unoffensive record, but I think had they spent a little more time on it, and weeded out some of the fillers,it could have gone <BR>onto bigger and better things. Still a good record, and better than most around in it`s day.
B0000028RR|5.0|I loved this album...I had never listened to a single one of thier albums until a friend bought one for me...This album rocks...the rifts and amazing sounds produced is fantastic.  I like the political protestment of thier music...&quot;F@#K You I won't do what you tell me&quot; what genius!!! If you are looking for a great CD I would definetly put this one at the top!
B0001FR3IG|2.0|Halle Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey, a brilliant doctor in a mental institution who wakes up one morning as a patient in her own hospital and begins to be visited by a female ghost in most \\"horrifying,\\" as the studio would lead you to believe, ways. I'll ignore the fact that the hospital's lights are always blinking and much of the equipment resembles a 1500s torture machine. But I refuse to ignore the blatant disregard for non-cheap thrills, quality acting, and screenplay (This \\"script\\" has more plot holes than 200 STAR TREK episodes). At the end of the day, it's somewhat entertaining, but obvious and easy to forget.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Once again Linkin Park has another great album.They are one of the best bands out there today.This cd(as are all their others)is a must buy.Anyone who gives any Linkin Park cd a bad review has no musical taste.This cd is not as good as Hybrid Theroy but still one of the best I have ever heard.
B000089RVX|4.0|First of all I do own this CD and I would recommend it to anyone. Amy lee has one of the most beautiful voices I have ever heard and the songs on this CD are just plain good! My immortal (radio version) is one of the most beautiful/moving songs i have ever heard in my life! Well I read many of these reviews saying how the group is a copy cat to some band named Lacuna Ciol that I have never heard of. Well I looked Lacuna Coil up right here on Amazon and took a listen. Let me tell you folks it was AWFUL. The female singer was off key and off pitch 99% of the time and was totally off beat and out of synch with the music. The music sucked also it was not better than Evanescence. All of you recommending Lacuna Coil instead of Evanescence must have been on some pretty heavy narcotics/medication when you told that lie. So what Lacuna Coil started whatever format first why aren't they famous umm jee because they  S-U-C-K hey folks whats that spell. Don't hate congragulate Evanescence on being a more TALENTED band! That's all folks. Get over it.
B00011RPB0|5.0|This is top three in my book between Shawshank Redemption and True Romance.  This movie is either you love it or you hate it.  I loved it because it showed how you need to cherish things for how they are and remember things.  Im not going to get into a philosophical rant, but this shows a relationship that doesnt need sex, and still is a strong and caring relationship with unconditional feelings (the only thing I could get from when Bill Murry is with the older chick).  It also has to do with what I feel how things dont last forever.  Regardless, this is an awesome movie, if you understand and love to search for meaning.  If you like a straight to the point story, you wont like it.  But you have to see it for yourself, dont listen to what everyone says, because people taint others thoughts and it messes up the experience.  So just disregard everything I said and go rent/buy the movie!
B00005JKC3|3.0|Question,did your dvd come with an insert of anykind?Mine did not,and that blows bigtime in my book for such a big &quot;hollywood&quot; movie.This is the first dvd I have gotten that didn't have a d@mn insert.<br />Oh yeah, the movie isn't as bad as most people say.Disappointment tends to cloud ones judgement of what they ARE seeing not what they had hoped to see.
B00005JMCW|5.0|This was a great remake.  I loved the original, and this one is just as good.  Well acted, funny, not boring, moved well, likable characters, it has it all.  It's cute, high quality family fare.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Love it, love it, love it!!!  This movie is hilarious from start to finish.  Plenty of humor for both kids and adults.  I love the jabs at Disney and the spoofs of other movies like Star Wars and The Matrix.  Mike Myers is perfect as the voice of Shrek though with the Scottish accent you would never recognize that it's him.  Eddie Murphy is perfect as Donkey.  Cameron Diaz is a perfect princess and John Lithgow is, as always, totally insane!  And don't miss the Shrek Karaoke Dance Party trailer that follows the closing credits.  It's a rip!
0385510438|2.0|John Grisham should stop churning out a book a year and focus on regaining the skills he had when he wrote A TIME TO KILL. Each &quot;novel&quot; has become progressively less satifying. I barely skimmed the last hundred pages of THE LAST JUROR.That's it for me with Grisham books.
0385335482|3.0|This is one of those fun, quick reads that you need after reading really heavy books by Thomas Hardy.  It's not the pinnacle of literary achievement; however, I don't believe it was trying to be.  It's exactly what it should be--a fun diversion.  Although I couldn't quite identify with Becky's spending habits, I thought they were hilarious.  But the best thing of this book is that Becky does grow up--not leaps and bounds, but a couple realistic steps towards being a better person.  I'm looking forward to reading the two follow-up books.
B00005JKHP|4.0|While it's still flawed, Robert Wise's Director's Edition of ST:TMP shows a huge improvement in pacing, structure and optical effects. Wise had a release date before he had even shot one reel of footage and, as a result, was working against a deadline from day one. With optical effects problems from the very first (the company hired couldn't deliver despite spending 5 million dollars), the original set scrapped (it was build for the planned television series and wasn't detailed enough for the motion picture screen)as well as endless rewrites (Alan Dean Foster's original script was radically rewritten by Harold Livingston), power struggles, etc. Wise had his work cut out for him.<br />The resulting film was compromised from the get go. Eventually John Dykstra (Star Wars, Spiderman)and Douglas Trumbull(2001, Close Encounters)were brought in to complete the massive amount of effects work necessary for the film. Wise didn't get a chance to really fine tune the final cut of the film until this DVD release. He took the opportunity to also go back and redo some of the opticals they didn't have time to finish. The only priviso was that the effects had to look like they were created in 1979. The resulting final product is a marvel to watch.<br />A mysterious cloud posessing enormous power and, perhaps, with a craft at its center advances on Earth. Why it's coming is a mystery. After it disintegrates two Klingon war vessels and a Federation space station, the Federation elects the Enterprise to attept first contact or, failing that, try and destroy the visitor.<br />Admiral Kirk convinces Starfleet to let him command the Enterprise over Captain Decker (recommended by Kirk)because of his experience. The revamped Enterprise isn't quite space worthy yet but must be launched within 12 hours to allow the Enterprise time to cut off the alien visitor before it reaches Earth.<br />Wise uses a slower pace to create suspense in ST:TMP and it's quite different from other installments in the film franchise. The regal pacing and production design might, at first, put off fans of films 2-6 and The Next Generation. Keep in mind that ST:TMP is from a different generation of filmmaking. ST:TMP straddles the line between The Day the Earth Stood Still (another Wise film) and Wrath of Kahn.<br />The first disc includes a combined commentary track featuring Wise, Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra, Jerry Goldsmith and others commenting on the stress and challenges of making of the original film. There's also comments from Wise about the changes made to the film for this DVD edition. The picture quality is exceptional although there are analog artifacts. Compression isn't an issue and I saw a bit of edge enhancement as well but, on the whole, it looks quite good. The remixed/remastered sound is a huge improvement on the original soundtrack (you can compare it to the deleted scenes to hear the difference). I'm not sure if this is an anamorphic widescreen transfer (it is presented in widescreen). The anamorphic transfer from video to DVd increases the resolution and clarity of the image. I believe it to be an anamorphic transfer but, again, have nothing to compare it against.<br />The second disc has all the extras including the scenes included in the 1979 version that were trimmed/cut/reshot for this edition. It also includes the extra scenes (including the infamous scene where Kirk goes after Spock outside the ship and you can see the edge of the set)for the 1983 television premiere as well. There's also feauturettes devoted to the new optical effects, publicity and interviews. There's also a section called Outtakes that focuses on an incomplete sequence that was replaced in the final film Spock going outside the ship and attempting to mind meld with the alien.<br />Although flawed with a script that was constantly being rewritten (with uncredited help from Leonard Nimoy), director Wise's film manages to capture both the sense of adventure and the larger than life qualities that made the series so popular. Keep in mind this film is less action oriented than other films in the franchise. It has more in common with the episodes like &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; and &quot;Nomad&quot; than it does &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; or &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. On its own, it's a fine film that has finally been finished in line with the vision Wise had for the film.life qualities that made the series so popular.

B00008PX8P|5.0|Any Zeppelin fan will love these DVDs.  There is a great variety of material to choose from, mainly concert footage of course, but behind the scenes stuff as well.  I found myself marveling at just how current and relevant the music stills seems, even after more than 30 years.  Will anyone be buying Justin Timberlake collections 30 years from now?  The sound and video quality is excellent, with none of the over produced feeling of other rock movies.  It is refreshing to see the price kept to such a reasonable level.  Given the paucity of Zeppelin material out there and the continuing popularity of the band, they could easily have doubled the price.
B000006OAM|5.0|This is an album im not afraid to say i listen wayyyyyyyy to much...hihiihi......An album that makes my entire collection.  These songs are moving and natalie has a great and powerul voice.  If yu wanna buy an album of hers this is the one.  Its actually perfect. 10/10 and i would give it higher!!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|It's a pretty rare event when I buy an album anymore, and it took me a while to decide whether to buy this album.  But in the end, I'm glad I did.  Every song on Fallen is memorable; from the rock of &quot;Going Under&quot; to the sad melodrama of &quot;My Immortal&quot;.  The lead singer's voice is clear and often haunting; and the music backs her up exquisitely.  Evanescence reminds me a little of Concrete Blonde around &quot;Bloodletting&quot; or early Garbage, though with the producing (some might say processing) reminiscent of Linkin Park and other recent &quot;rock&quot; groups.  If you like what you've heard on the radio, you'll probably enjoy the entire album.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I realize that most of the time the masses are wrong when they collectively say something is great and do so just to follow what is popular. This is not the case with Citizen Kane.<BR>Breifly put, this movie is based on the life of Hearst. The movie follows the life of one of New Yorks robber barrons, in this case, a media giant. The base of the movie is to discover the meaning of his dieing words, \\"Rosebud\\".<BR>First off, if you call a movie \\"good\\" because of color, action, sex, flashy camera work, or drugs, do not waste your time. This movie was made in 1941...movies were quite different. Also, if you do not pick up on symbolisim, then either watch with a friend, or don't watch. You just wont understand it. <BR>This movie requires being watched several times to fully understand why it is the best American movie. the first time you watch it, you will realize it is great, but every time you watch it, you will learn something new, and pick up on great details. The camera work, while not flashy, is amazingly well done, as is the lighting, adding great drama and feel to the film. Once you discover what Rosebud means, you will be amazed by this film.
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|Celine never fails to amaze me!<br />This CD fulfils my expectations from a very talented artist.  Many people who are used to her &quot;American&quot; albums honestly have no idea the of the power of this singer until they hear her sing in her native language.<br />I continually read comments from people about how they are amazed that she can sing French.  This aggrivates me as any true Celine fan would know that she is a Canadian native, whose first released albums in the 1980's and early 90's were all French spoken, before she even understood or knew how to speak English as a second language.<br />If you want true to heart, insiring Celine with a few upbeat tempo songs, I definatly recommend this album.  Celine sounds specacular singing with the &quot;4 types&quot; or male voices on this album.  But not to dispair, there are still Celine solo songs sure to please any die-hard fan, French speaking or not.<br />In my mind, this album ranks even higher than my opinions of her &quot;One Heart&quot; CD, her last English release.<br />This CD is sure to please die hard Celine Fans (even if you don't understand French which I do not) and is sure to not give you the pounding headaches from the bass like &quot;One Heart&quot; did to me.<br />All in all, 5/5 stars for this entire CD.  If you can appreciate Celine in French then you are truely an inspired Celine Dion fan and this CD is a perfect addition to any Celine fans' collection.
B000085RTZ|4.0|These guys have talent!  I went through a full listen (Definately got the money's worth, long album) and thought it was creative and fresh.  Later I found myself listening to it more and more and fell in love with the album.  This is beautiful.
B000002AS3|5.0|Definitely Maybe introduced the world to Oasis. Upon its release, the band became huge in their native Britain. Although the album fared well in America, it would be their next album (What's The Story) Morning Glory that would make them superstars here. However, Definitely Maybe is their best work and their most consistent album. Yes, some of their riffs are definitely borrowed from other artists. But it's easy to forget this when their songs are so catchy and irresistible.<br /><br />Every track here is a winner and the loud, noisy production only adds to the proceedings. \\"Rock N' Roll Star\\" starts the album out with a bang, one of the better opening album tracks of recent memory. The tracks \\"Shakermaker\\", \\"Up In The Sky\\", \\"Digsy's Diner\\", and especially \\"Live Forever\\" all have great hooks and memorable melodies that stay in your head long after you've heard them. The hard driving \\"Bring It On Down\\", the T-Rex soundalike \\"Cigarettes and Alcohol\\", and the dirty groove of \\"Supersonic\\" sound like they were made for the concert stage. Other strong tracks here include the mid-tempo rockers \\"Columbia\\" and \\"Slide Away\\", and the acoustic closer \\"Married With Children\\" which sounds reminiscent of the Beatles' mid-60's work. If you like great rock n'roll with attitude, you'll enjoy this.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|Hotels...even in your home country, they can be the loneliest place on the planet.  You are on your own island, away from everything.  That's where Bob Harris is...only he's in a country he doesn't really understand, away from a family that may or may not really love him.  Charlotte is in the same hotel, with her husband, but he is constantly working.  Bob and Charlotte meet a few times before really becomming friends, discussing family and life.  Scarlett Johannsen is perfect in this movie, and Bill Murray is simply amazing.<br />The DVD doesn't have many special features, but what it lacks in quantity, it more than makes up in quality.  The making-of documentary is a joy to watch, and you get to see how emotional Sofia gets when she is talking about Bill Murray.<br />I highly recommend this DVD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|My favorite film of 2003 by far. Probably in my top 10 of all time. The end made my eyes well up with tears, which rarely happens. If you cannot see the beauty in this film, you have no f**king soul...
B00006690G|5.0|Eminem just keeps on getting better.  Anybody who buys this c.d and claims to be at all surprised by the negative comments and the insescent cursing needs to pay attention.  Everbody knows what Eminem is famous for, he writes his outrageous comments for shock value.  You knew what he was about when you bought the c.d, and knew what he was about when you allowed your children to buy his c.d.  Have common sense here people, Eminem himself says that he wouldn't let his own daughter listen to his music, obviously there is a  maturity and intellegence level that is needed in order to appreciate the c.d for what it is ENTERTAINMENT.  This c.d has catchy beats, the talents of both Timbaland and Nate Dogg, not to mention the many others who help to make this c.d a hit.  This is the kind of c.d you listen to because of the deadly tracks, the funny or even the outlandish crude things that Eminem has to say, all the while remembering that it is all a marketing strategy, think about the fact that he's writing it in his lyrics and not physically doing the things that he writes about.  This is not a c.d for the narrowminded.  If your looking for something that is going to pump you up, while at the same time sending you through a whirlspin of different emotions all within the same verse or bridge, this is for you.  For all of you who have nothing better to do then buy a c.d and then knock it to anybody who will listen don't bother.  WE don't expect you to grasp the concept that this is fictional material and that he is not even half serious about the things that he says.  We don't expect you to understand the rythems and the beat and the deadly bass that will pump through your veins when you got this c.d jacked as loud as it can go.  Listen to the way he expreses his anger and the whole range of his emotions while maintaing a consistent speed and rythem.  Give the c.d a chance and read between the lines, at what he's really saying, how he's laughing at everybody who just assumes that he means everything that he says, hear the good things that he has to say, and understand that there is truth to what he writes, understand that what he is saying is really happening out there he's just the only one who is strong enough to take the heat and speak up. Pay attention when you listen to this c.d and I guarentee that you will be presently surprised.  Give the songs a chance instead of just listening to the first few bars thinking that they all sound the same, it's not the repetition that matters it's the skill that goes into writing his lyrics, and the attention to detail that makes this c.d one of the best.  Buy this c.d, if your smart enough to know the difference between the real world, the ramblings of an ENTERTAINER out to shock you and the insecure, have nothing better to do people who knock this c.d without even giving it a chance.

0385512104|5.0|Fifteen-year-old Christopher, a child with autism who lives with his father in Swindon, England, is horrified to discover that their neighbor's beloved pet dog Wellington has been killed by a garden fork.  Much to the dismay of his father, Christopher begins to investigate who was responsible for this animal's murder.  Despite his dad instructions to stop interefering in other people's business, Christopher does not stop persuing his goal.  In the course of trying to solve the murder without his father's knowledge, Christopher makes other startling discoveries about his family.<br />What is most amazing about this book is how Christopher's thoughts clearly express the turmoil that permeate the mind of an autistic individual.  Such a person understands the world differently from an average person, and the book does well at illustrating that difference.  By putting this young man's thought processes into words through a fascinating story, the author has the ability to influence his readers to become more compassionate to a person in the real world with such an aflliction. It's written so well that it almost seems to be a real story. Reminiscent of the way Jonathan Lethem treats Tourette's Syndrome in Motherless Brooklyn, Mark Haddon brings his readership closer to the true person inside an outer shell that can be misunderstood and frightening to others.
0385510438|4.0|Probably the best part of \\"The Last Juror\\" is the author's capture of life in the deep South in 1970: its slowness, the bypassing of modernity, the overindulgence in good bourbon to get through the day, the corrupt political system, the influence of powerful families, the racial divide, etc. But this placid way of life is harshly disrupted when a son, Danny, of the powerful, insulated crime family, the Padgitt's, that has dominated rural Ford county for decades, is accused of rape and murder. It is also the opportunity for the newly arrived Willie Traynor, fresh from dropping out of an \\"Ivy League\\"college after five uninspiring years and the surprising new owner (even to him) via his kindly grandmother of the county newspaper in serious decline, to make something of himself.<br />The Ford County Times dramatically increases circulation as it follows the Padgitt affair. The author follows Willie and his ad hoc assemblage of employees and his dealings with courthouse hanger-ons. By far the most interesting part of the book beyond the murder and its fallout is the relationship that Willie developes with the Ruffin family of the Lowdown section of town, especially with the matriarch, Miss Callie. Willie draws strength from the resolve of that family in overcoming the racial barriers of the South in those times.<br />The last chapter of the Padgitt affair begins with the release of Danny after only serving nine years of a life sentence. Everyone's worst fears are realized when a series of what seems to be revenge murders begins. The author brings the threads of Willie's newspaper ownership, the Ruffin family, and the Padgitt situation to an agreeable conclusion.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|UNDERWORLD is the kind of film that studios -- during the late 70s and 80s -- considered 'throwaways': horror films given a certain degree of mythology meant to attract little more than the teen audience willing to spend a few bucks for a few scares.  The influence of STAR WARS, George Lucas, and Steven Spielberg on the film industry, however, largely has caused the industry to reinvent the horror (monster, not slasher) film as &quot;an event film&quot;: cast some modest to big name actors, throw in heavier doses of backstory and mythology, and viola!  You've got art!<br />Of course, vampires are enjoying a reasonable rebirth as of late.  INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE had the critics up in arms, while BLADE (I &amp; II) really catored more to the 18-45 demographic in terms of violence, music, and action.  Even television got into the act with KINDRED: THE EMBRACED, BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL, and the stellar BBC mini ULTRAVIOLET.  As with the vast vampire subculture, there's plenty of blood here for good stories.<br />In that estimation, UNDERWORLD feels underdone.  It's full of big ideas -- a centuries old unknown war between Vampires and Werewolves for dominance, Vampire covens ruled by reawakened members of the undead, DNA sequencing to try and create a hybrid between the two species, a Romeo &amp; Juliet spinoff love story -- that needed to be cooked a while longer in order to determine which ingredients would produce the best dish -- including Kate Beckingsale whose behind looks absolutely spectacular in leather.<br />Despite the studio's rush to greenlight a sequel, UNDERWORLD played to solid (not great) box office receipts, and this viewer only hopes that the creative folk will peel back some layers of the mythology they've created in order to deliver a product that feels less 'rushed' and far more 'important.'
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The Cinematography was great.<br />The actors did a fine job.<br />Reading all the reviews it can be easily seen that there are those that like it, and those that hate it.<br />I watch a lot of foreign language films, and consider myself about as \\"anti-Hollywood\\" as they come.<br />But a move still comes down to getting a point across in a way that viewers can relate too; this one doesn't.<br />I saw two spoiled rich people that had more money than sense in this film.<br />I have traveled a lot, and if people go into a new culture as these two did, with the amounts of time and money that they appeared to have, and still could be so pitiable, I have no sympathy.<br />Some reviewers rave about the subtle message, but Harry Cohen of Columbia had a great line for this sort of thought: \\"...if you want to deliver a message, send a telegram...\\"<br />He had a rule; the more his butt twitched in a chair, the worse it was:  This was a real tail-twister!<br />I wouldn't say not to watch it, because it does have redeeming aspects, but anyone that thinks this is a moumental achievement of film needs to go back to school.<br />I think Blade Runner captures more of the sense of isolation in a strange environmeent, and the disconnect of beings from life, than this did, and that is just one film off the top of my head.<br />Just rent it; don't buy it.<br />20 years from now no one will even remember it....
0451169514|4.0|This is a great book, a modern classic, but I have some reserves about it, namely the actual monster which is pretty much just derived from the \\"Return of the King\\" in a certain lair and Pennywise the clown is not frightening enough. So in terms of scares this book is not really the scariest King novel, in fact far from it, but then again IT tries to be more than just a horror novel and this is where it works best.<br />IT is actually best described as a \\"coming of age\\" book about a group of young adolescence who are bound by one common dominator - IT and how this thing has infected their town and their lives. The story is told in \\"Stand By Me\\" fashion, moving between various timelines in the past and the future as the gang remember their past and the horror that lurked in the sewers of their home town. So what you get is multiple characters, fully fleshed out and this bonding which is along the lines of \\"Let's kill the beast and save the day\\".<br />IT was actually written by cocaine fuelled Stephen King in his early days and even he admits that this one just appeared next his typewriter by the time he sobered up and it reads like it to. This book is massive and very thick but that does not mean it rambles on. There is a lot of substance to the story and the character development is first rate for this kind of literature. I recommend IT to teenagers especially because the story of friendship is a powerful one and adults will like it just as much as homage to their youth.<br />In short you can not go too far wrong with IT but remember you will be reading this book for the long haul but the pace is somewhat good. It is a unique book for its kind but again I have reserves about just how scary it really is. It is scary enough but not as much as it could have been and the actual monsters in this book are little bit undernourished in the frights department.

B000127LW2|1.0|Voyager was never my favorite ST show.  It always seemed like ST lite.  but it was still pretty good compared to Enterprise, and also Nemesis,  (which was just awful).  Voyager always reminds me of the line for Indiana Jones and the last crusade,  when Indy snr says to 'junior'  \\"just as you got interesting, you left...\\"<br />Anyway,  I will be buying this series,  but what has Paramount done with the box - it looks awful! - cheap and in day-glo orange!! - I don't understand why we in the US don't get the same super-cool sleek boxes that they have in Europe... I bought TNG and DS9 from Amazon.co.uk,  they have the really cool hard plastic space boxes....  It's a US show,  how come we don't get the good stuff!!! - come on Paramount!!!  I want the Red and silver Voyager box, but I don't want to have to pay international shipping and handling, AND  have to have region free player to watch it!
B00005JM02|3.0|I do not like computer-animated children's films like Shrek, Monster's Inc., etc., but I bought Finding Nemo because many respected reviewers had placed it on their Top Ten lists.  The animation was terrific, of course, but the simple characterizations, simple story and contrived 'hollywood' humor left me bored and fast-forwarding to the credits.  This film is no different than Shrek, Ice Age, and the other modern kids' comedies.  Not bad, just not up my alley.
0385510438|5.0|If you crossed &quot;The Painted House&quot; with &quot;The Firm&quot;, you'd get a book like this one.  I thought it was one of Grisham's best ever. I haven't cared for Grisham's latest mysteries - they've merely been vehicles for his heavy-handed and probably recently-discovered social conscience.  Only the newly-saved get that preachy.  I surprised myself by enjoying 'Painted House', though it's not the kind of book I read for pleasure very often.<br />I'm fully aware of how grim reality is and tend to look for entertainment that let's me escape from the brutality &amp; tragedy of real life.  In movies, if it has explosions, I'll probably like it.  Now you know where I'm coming from.<br />&quot;Last Juror&quot; had just enough literary &quot;merit&quot; to make the characters come alive.  But, it still had good guys and bad guys and action and all the other stuff that make it a fun read.  And, it kept me up late, on the edge of my seat.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the dialogue, some of the special effects, the story, and the plot or lack thereof.  I had seen the trailer in a theater and thought it looked like it would be great movie, a war between mythological immortals made sense to me (vampires versus werewolves (Lycans)).  Heck it has Kate Beckinsale as the moody queen of the Vampire deathdealers!  Unfortunately it was not even one of her better performances due primarily to the lack of a coherent story and poor character development. It was comfusing at times and all of the stunts were Matrix and Blade redos that just weren't as well pulled off IMHO.  The greatest disappointment was that the premise of the story was a great idea but it just wasn't done in a way that made sense.  Mediocre dialog between Selene and Victor (Lord of the Vampires) and Craven (his wannabe successor).  My biggest question was what did all the Vampires who hung around the &quot;Vampire Mansion&quot; do besides lay around??<BR>Buy Blade or even Blade II just don't waste your money on this flop like I did!

B000089CKH|5.0|A great album by a band that has matured from their &quot;Popular&quot; days.  I finally purchased it after hearing a few of the tracks, and I'm glad I did.  A lovely listening experience.  I'm constanty discovering new things I like about each song, but &quot;Inside of Love&quot; is easily my favorite on the album.  Evocative lyrics sung against a gorgeous melody; this song is more complex and sonically layered than you might initially think.  Excellent, excellent, excellent.  Wish I spoke French.
0385504209|1.0|There is No doubt the book is written well and in a manor they could cause one to become interested in the subject matter; but the information in the book is false. Let me give one example. Brown contends that the cannon of the scripture was put into existence in the 5th century AD., but the fact is, Tartillian, a Lawyer and Early church father, listed the cannon in total in the second century A.D. The truth is most early Church fathers were in agreement, this book takes a small minority opinion that was considered a hearsay at the time and makes it the dominate belief at the time. That is horrible scholarship. Most of Browns theories are not from the early church traditions, as I just sated he took a semi early heresy; but he gathered most of his information from the middle ages, when the knights Templars came up with he holy blood line BS. Really this is a rehash of a rehash, holy blood holy grail also did the same thing 20 years ago. It would be better if people sake the truth. One good way would be to read the new testament, The Apostle Paul's epistles totally blow Brown out of the water; Read the Lost Shipwreck of Paul for a great Historical book. Read Da Vinci if you must but look at is as fiction and entertainment; Read the new testament if you want the TRUTH.
B00005JL0I|4.0|Great movie! Sir James Bond played by David Niven is forced back into espionage after his hedonistic lifestyle is so rudely interrupted by a British army 81mm mortar team who proceeds to blow up his perfectly splendid castle. Bond prefers a life of luxury to the dangers of espionage but alas, it's back to the good old Walther PPK 7.65mm and the cloak and dagger for 007. As Dr. Michael Lim the Travelling Gourmet, I too appreciate the finer things in life. I think all fans of Bond do too. The music is remarkable. This is THE movie where that immortal and hauntingly seductive song, by Burt Bacharach, &quot;The Look of Love&quot; reaches deep into your libido and psyche, especially  when you hear it for the very first time. My old friend, the late Derek Nimmo (of BBC's Just a Minute) fame is in this movie too as a would be Bond under the tutelage of Sir James himself. If you see the current Austin Powers movies you'll see where the scipt writers got many of their ideas from. Beautiful and seductively voluptuous women abound as in all 007 movies. In those days, men were men and women were not pale, anaemic anorexic skin and bone creatures but lovely, curvaceous and meaty damsels. Bring back the real women I say to Hollywood film makers! This spook spoof will put a smile on your lips and cheer you up no end. Certain scenes like when Sir James demonstrates how things should be done are really hilarious. Above all, the classic British ideal of stiff upper lip, always remain calm and unruffled no matter what, and carry on regardless...comes through all the antics, bombs, blondes and bullets. David Niven comes a very close second to Patrick Macnee (The Avengers) when it comes to playing cool, calm and collected English gentlemen. And so, what's next? As Austin Powers would say, &quot;Yeah, Baby, Yeah!!!&quot; By Dr. Michael Lim The Travelling Gourmet ENJOY!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Quite possibly the worst recording in the history of recorded music. Embarrassingly bad.  Actually makes Madonna seem talented.
B00018D44U|3.0|I doubt Norah Jones will ever allow herself to be confined by a genre, and I applaud that. The breathy, somewhat smoky quality of her voice works well in several genres: Jazz, blues, folk, and country. Given that, I will expect to hear a few different things on each of her albums, and for no two albums to be alike.<br />On this set, however, it sounds as if she's tried too hard to defy classification, so hard that she forgot to be selective. There's half a dozen good tracks on this album, and they range from bluesy to outright country (a duet with Dolly Parton, which just may be the highlight of the whole thing). Fine, except that the album contains a total of 13 tracks, and the rest seem to be pointless filler, having a generic sound and meaningless lyrics.<br />Being talented enough to sing across genres means having more choices of material, which she does and will. But having more choices means needing to make those choices with greater care. For this album, she didn't do that, and the result is a hit-and-miss outing.<br />Still, there's enough here to recommend purchase, especially for those of us with eclectic musical tastes. Afterall, how many times will we ever get to hear Dolly Parton on a Blue Note recording, and how many times will the result of that actually be good? Probably just this once, so give it a listen.
B000099T2L|1.0|This is pure garbage. Another one of those horrible RnB singers that all sound exactly the same who practically have to appear naked to get attention. It just shows how pathetic the state of music is these days that this is up for a grammy award.
B00005JKJA|1.0|My rating for the DVD of \\"Mulholland Drive,\\" is no reflection of how I feel about the film itself, for it is certainly one of the best works in the Lynchian canon. I gave this DVD a poor rating, because a rather disturbing, not so subtle alteration has been made for the DVD transfer. I was shocked to discover when I watched the copy that I purchased at Best Buy that a scene had been digitally censored, and what appeared on my screen was markedly different from what I saw in the cinema. When the character we come to know as Rita disrobes before climbing into bed with Betty, a distracting flesh-colored scramble of pixels has been substituted for an area where one would normally expect to see pubic hair. Since this scrambling was not evident in the version of \\"Mulholland Drive\\" that I saw in theatres (twice), I can only expect that this is another example of squeamish puritanical tampering for an American audience that can consume any amount of violence, but should be protected from the fright of a sexual organ (see \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\"). I was informed that a copy of this DVD purchased at JandR in Manhattan was similarly \\"blurred\\" for the protection of the viewer. I know we live in the era of wardrobe malfunction hysteria, but the marring of a magnificent film like this for its DVD release is unacceptable.
0060934913|5.0|Where does one begin to comment on this wonderful, many faceted book?  Do you comment on Bourdain's early years working in New England fish restaurants whose number one competitor was Mario's Restaurant that turned out six hundred meals on an average night or do you jump forward to the book's last days when he is told by the owners to oversee the establishment of a new restaurant in Tokyo?  This book is truly a culinary journey and more interestingly I believe a &quot;Coming of Age&quot; in an industry that can vacillate between the life on a road crew in the Arizona desert or the intensity and concentration of a symphony orchestra-the sublime to the ridiculous.              <br />Besides the extraordinary insights into restaurants,<BR>food preparation and management from the other side of the kitchen trenches, Bourdain gives his readers a funny and trenchant look at the marvelous personalities that have peppered his career. Who could ever forget Bigfoot-the ownership steward par excellence or Steven-Bourdain's right hand sous chef or New York's best baker-Adam-Real Last Name Unknown.  The section about Adam alone is worth the cost of the book-even if, and that would be a severe mistake, you read nothing else of this wonderful work.<br />Read this book because it's funny, wise and allows a peek into a foreign world but a world whose edges are familiar to anyone who eats.

B000002LFZ|4.0|I love compilations. Love them. You get to have most of an artist's best songs for you to enjoy. If you don't know much about said artist, it's your chance to get to know them. If you're already a fan, it's great to have tracks you love in one single CD. But, as I've said before, they don't come without problems. The matter of chosing which songs should be included is always a touchy subject, because everyone has different likes and dislikes, and most of the time record labels and/or the artists *miss* or *forget* songs that fans claim for.<br />Fleetwood Mac: Greatest Hits is not an exception to this rule. In fact, in my opinion, there are at least two tracks missing from this collection: Landslide and The Chain, which are, and I think you will agree, a couple of the band's most famous songs, and by not being included here, lessen the impact of the CD a little bit.<br />Having said that, this is a great collection indeed, with some amazing work and some really great, classic tunes, like Rhiannon, Don't stop, As long as you follow, Go your own way and Dreams. This is classic Fleetwood Mac, mostly from the Lindsey Buckingham-Stevie Nicks era.<br />But if you really want to have a better collection of the Mac's work, you should skip this CD and get the two CD The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac which includes 36 tracks. I would have given 5 stars to this CD if the newer collection didn't exist, but as it is, I should say that it's better than this one if only because it includes the two tracks named before, and some of the stuff that came after the release of the first collection.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|This movie has been called \\"Dead Poets Society for girls\\", and while there are strong similarities between these two movies, Mona Lisa Smile stands on its own. Julia Roberts plays Katherine Howard, a \\"California bohemian\\" who comes to Wellesley College to teach History of Art to a group of (mostly) spoiled rich girls who are there just biding their time until they get married. She intends to change this by making them see they can do whatever they want to do with their lives, not just someone's wives.<br />Of course, trying to change tradition and the College's establishment doesn't come cheaply, as she is seen by her students as someone not worthy (why isn't she married?) and as someone dangerous by the school's governing body. She doesn't follow tradition, doesn't obey the rules and has what they call unorthodox ways of teaching, like taking the girls to see modern art and not following the curse's syllabus.<br />As time passes and the girls get to know her, things start to change, and by the end of the movie everyone has learned a valuable lesson in life.<br />One of the main differences between this movie and Dead Poets Society is that it mainly follows Katherine's life, leaving the students' lives as secondary stories, while in DPS it's the other way around. We do however share some moments with some of the other characters, namely Betty Warren (Dunst), the bratty, spoiled girl who despises Katherine and her ways, Joan Brandwyn (Stiles), who is somewhat torn between life as a housewife and going to Law school, Connie Baker (Goodwin), whose not as beautiful as the other girls and only dreams of finding love, and Giselle Levy (Gyllenhall), the wild, sexy girl. Most of the movie, however, centers on Katherine's struggles both on and off campus, as she starts a romantic relationship with the school's Italian teacher (West).<br />Set in the 50's, this movie deal mainly with the subject of liberation and equality, its message being that women can be all they want to be, not only wives.<br />The acting in the film is solid, starting with Roberts, but the real standouts are the girls. Dunst does mean and bitchy very well, and Stiles gives another good performance, but the two shining characters are Goodwin and Gyllenhall. Marcia Gay Harden, as the repressed Nancy Abbey, the school's teacher for \\"how to behave in society affairs\\" and Katherine's house mate.be, not only wives.<br />The acting in the film is solid, starting with Roberts, but the real standouts are the girls.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|Maybe my expectations of this movie were a little high, but when I saw this movie recently, I was left with a feeling of \\"is that it?\\"    Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson both do superb jobs of playing two lonely people set adrift in an unfamilar setting. Both actors seem to play from experience more so than sole acting ability the emotions and feelings that may come across people in similar situations. The directing was beautiful and Sofia Coppola does have an eye for beautiful scenery and poignant moments. I love the lack of music where most other directors would put in a musical score to carry a weak scene.    It is reminiscent of life, of meeting a stranger in a peculiar circumstance and becoming best friends, if only for a day or two. The ending didn't seem to fit the feeling or the tone of the rest of the movie and seemed out-of-place and very Hollywood. One downside to this is there were parts in the movie where I almost fell asleep and the person I was watching with actually DID fall asleep. This is not a good movie to watch when you're tired or easily distracted because you won't make it through the entire movie.

B00018D44U|3.0|Come Away With Me was nice, mostly because other people wrote Norah songs for her. But on this cd, the songwriting is not up to the same quality (she and her boyfriend are doing most of the writing). Plus, I was expecting her to show more muscle vocally (to prove her doubters that she can sing) and she totally didn't. The only difference between this cd and her last one is on this cd; she has become less of a jazz singer and more country. I am disappointed in this cd, but I can't blast this cd. It still ranks high and above a lot of crap that's on the radio today. I just hope that Norah realizes that she has to show more growth and connect with her emotions if she wants to continue as an artist like this. She is a very nice person, humble and down to earth. But she lost me on this one.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Here's a shout out to anyone who has ever knocked on, or made fun of Pink Floyd. It's not possible. If you make fun of any of the greats - Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, The Doors - and call yourself a rock music fan, then YOU my friend, are an ignorant. Dark Side of the Moon is undoubtably one of the best thought-out albums of all time. I enjoy The Wall alot as well, but in my own opinion, Pink Floyd's strongest album start to finish is DSOTM. I recommend that everyone buys this album. Yes, I am 18, i do listen to punk rock and new age rock, but there is nothing that truely tops this album; it's an experience of it's own, separate from anything else. ....See you on the Dark Side of the Moon.....<br />p.s. - the lazer light shows of DSOTM and The Wall are amazing. check it out.
B00003CXCT|3.0|Yes the last of the hold-out DVD are coming in September, sadly they are the \\" special edition \\" copies of the first 3 ( last 3? ) movies where George-I can do what I want-Lucas added alot of less than state-of-the-art CGI ( notice how liquidy jabba looks in the hanger )  They will sound nice and look very good Im sure. However if you want to see the classics save your VHS tapes or if your truely blessed the Lazerdiscs of the original films. <br />\\"The force will be with you, always\\"<br />Obi-wan to Luke in Episode IV
B0000VAFNQ|1.0|Underworld, has vampires and werewolves in the modern world, fighting each other with guns and special ammo. The only good thing I could say about Underworld is that the special effects were good and the action scenes were well done. Now for the bad parts; the story was boring and confusing, the characters were uninteresting because they had weak dialog. I didn't like any of the characters and couldn't care less who lived or died. Kate Beckinsale's performance was very sterile. The whole movie takes place in nighttime and is terribly dark. All the scenes are so dark, even the action sequences were almost ruined by the darkness. They also kept showing very annoying flashbacks (that made no sense at all). Underworld also has a bad ending! I suggest you see \\"Blade\\" instead of this one.
B00011RPB0|2.0|---------------Minor Spoilers---------------------    I've been hearing about this movie for months and I finally watched it with enthusiasm. I decided to give this movie two stars, one for the good cinematography and the other for trying to be different.     This movie had a lot of potential, it's about an older man who is having a mid-life crisis and a young woman who is trying to find herself but is feeling lost (both are from America). A plot that speaks to a lot of people I'm sure. The way this story is told is where it goes wrong. It felt like the director wanted to skimp on characterization so she took the easy way out and used a foreign country to showcase these two characters' feelings of loneliness and alienation instead of exploring why and how they became like this in America. The reason why I think this is because setting the movie in Japan does nothing to furthur explore these characters especially since they were already alone and lost BEFORE coming to Japan. I was disappointed to see the way the director portrayed Japanese people as weird and speaks bad English. I thought the way she highlighted these things were untrue, shallow, and unneccessary. She could have achieved the same effect (them being \\"lost\\") simply by focusing on the fact that they didn't know the area or any of the people there.  These two characters were also two very weak and boring people. Here they are disillusioned with thier lives, they have a perfect chance to find themselves again because they are in a beautiful, exciting, innovative country. All they have to do is walk outside and yet they sit around their hotel waiting for something to happen to them. How illogical is that?! Instead of being two mature people who can experience and enjoy thier great oppurtunities, they act like two immature, shallow kids.    I absolutely respect endings that are meaningful. I certainly don't expect to have things spelled out for me but I also don't want a pretentious ending.  If you are looking for a movie in this genre then try \\"American Beauty\\". \\"Chungking express\\" and \\"Fallen angels\\" are two amazing movies that have a similar theme but is MUCH more enjoyable to watch.
B00018D44U|5.0|I was in the bathroom of this quaint little fish market with a converted restaurant when I first heard Norah's voice.  I remember standing around in that humid little red bathroom through almost 3 tracks (not exactly good protocol on a date) totally enraptured by the the &quot;not quite raspy, not quite silk&quot; quality of her voice, the seductive cadence in her rythm, and delicious instramental accompaniments.<br />I was an immediate fan and bought her CD the next day.  Norah singlehandedly branded my entire summer of 2002 as &quot;romantic&quot; with her first major work.<br />So with nervous anticipation I had my first listen of this CD tonight, and without further ado, I'm so happy to report that &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; (in my opinion) is as good or better than &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  Thank you Norah!<br />From what I know of Norah Jones, she got her musical career really moving when she moved from Texas to New York City.  I'm guessing here, but if I had to ascribe a dominant geographic influence to each album, I'd say Come Away &quot;leans New York&quot; while Feels Like Home seems rooted more in Texas.  Perhaps that's why this new album is named what it is...?<br />The only song on this CD I didn't immediately love is &quot;Creepin In&quot;.  It moves fast, is definitively country (I'm fairly certain Dolly Parton is singing along, but I don't have the album cover), yet it's very catchy and fun (as testimony, I found myself humming it tonight in the shower).<br />Below is a list of songs that (if you love her past work) you'll immediately adore:<br /><br />Sunrise:  I got an advance listen to this track a couple of months ago and fell in love with it at first listen.  I think it's one of the loveliest songs on the album.<br />What Am I To You:  Beautiful BB King style R&amp;B track.  Will certainly be a huge hit.  When I first listened to this CD I couldn't get past this particular song.  I listened to it a half-dozen times straight.<br />Carnival Town:  Mostly guitar and piano (which is when I think she's at her best), the intricacy in her luscious voice is amplified and really stands out for appreciation.<br />In The Morning:  If I decided to do what I threatened so often as a kid to do, and &quot;ranaway&quot;, this would be the perfect song to play as I screamed out of town in some hastily acquired convertible...Rambling Anyone?  Sorry...This track is intense (not loud), with a wonderful buildup and easy flowing rhythm punctuated by passionate lyrics that then break into cool but subdued R&amp;B.<br />Toes:  Norah at her best!  Dreamy and romantic, the rhythm moves unpredictably but &quot;just right&quot; between light and heavy.  Yikes, if that's not ambigious (might make more sense to you when you hear it).<br />Humble Me:  Hauntingly lonely guitar entr&eacute;es this song about struggle, desperation, and forgiveness.  Ooh this one is good!<br />The Prettiest Thing:  This is a slam dunk hit.  A jazzy, slow rhythm that picks up in tempo and seduces you into focusing on what is probably her most romantic moment in the CD (occurs around 2 minutes 45 seconds into this track).  Forgive me if this is overly dramatic (it's 2am at the writing of this review), but this song literally gave me the chills.<br />And on that note, I'll sign off.  Enjoy this elegant work of art, you won't be dissapointed.al Town:  Mostly guitar and piano (which is when I think she's at her best), the intricacy in her luscious voice is amplified and really stands out for appreciation.  <br />In The Morning:  If I decided to do what I threatened so often as a kid to do, and &quot;ranaway&quot;, this would be the perfect song to play as I screamed out of town in some hastily acquired convertible...Rambling Anyone?

B00004YW6I|4.0|I really like this CD as a CD: that is, it is very listenable as a whole and has some very good songs.  That said, most of the songs don't have all the reach out an grab you power of the best of the songs from To Bring You My Love or Is This Desire?  But if you want a PJ CD you can pop in and listen to straight through, then this is a great choice (that or burn the more listenable tracks from some of her other CDs onto a new one for when you are not quite in the mood for the roughest tracks -- or maybe that's sacrilege).  Here, Big Exit, Good Fortune, and One Line stand out.  What I really like about Good Fortune -- which also why this albumn has been criticized -- is that so much genuine hapiness shows through.  And that's great.  A new and fantastic facet to Ms. Harvey's music.  I put this CD in rotation with the other four PJ Harvey CDs I own -- I wouldn't want the happy (if sometimes whistful) version of PJ over the sometime angsty sometime anxious sometimes frenetic PJ of other albumns every day.  But this albumn doesn't suffer (much) for the comparison, just demonstrates a different aspect.
0783229372|2.0|First things first: The picture quality on this DVD is horrendous. Although presented in widescreen, the film print is swimming in scratches and dust. The image is often grainy and ugly, with poor contrast, especially during scenes taking place at night. I really expected better from a major DVD releaser like Universal. Anyone who remembers seeing this in a theater back in 1975 will feel very disappointed with this disc.<br />As for the film itself, it is another entry in the mid-70s disaster film sweepstakes, although it tries to present itself as more a \\"whodunit\\" or espionage mystery; imagine \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" if the trail derailed massively at the finale. George C. Scott, gruff as usual, plays the German Colonel working to determine who onboard the legendary Zeppelin crossing the Atlantic might have a reason for sabotaging the ship. There are plenty of suspects, most of them famous or semi-famous actors (Anne Bancroft, Burgess Meredith, Rene Aberjonois, Charles Durning, William Atherton). Who has the best reason for wanting the Hindenburg to go boom?<br />This is a fanciful version of the events leading up to the disaster -- the actual reasons for the event have never been determined -- and I have to credit director Robert Wise for maintaining reasonable suspense in a story whose ending is well-known (the DVD cover itself shows you what happens). But, sadly, \\"The Hindenburg\\" is mostly hot air: dull, artificial, and a lot of talk going nowhere, and too typical of the formerly great director Wise (\\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" \\"The Haunting,\\" \\"The Sound of Music\\") in the later phase of his career. Many great characters actors onboard get nothing to do. Burgess Meredith is especially criminally underused. Scott and Bancroft have very little chemistry in their vague relationship, and TV actor Roy Thinnes as the Gestapo agent is laughably bad. The only interesting scene before the big finale is an exciting sequence involving the repair of a damaged fin. David Shire's excellent score really excels here. But otherwise the film is just killing time until the long-anticipated climax.<br />And the climax is an incredible let-down, using a special effects cheat that will infuriate a lot of viewers. The effects in the film are excellent up to this point (marred, unfortunately, by the rotten DVD quality), but for the main event, the film cops out on us in a big way, relying on archival footage instead of new effects. A few of the character stories are never wrapped up either, leaving the viewer with an enormously unsatisfied feeling.<br />\\"The Hindenburg\\" really should only be seen by history nuts and disaster film completists, and they'll be unhappy with poor DVD quality. The casual viewer will be better off with \\"The Towering Inferno\\" or \\"The Poseidon Adventure.\\" (Geez, I just recommended an Irwin Allen film over a Robert Wise film!)
0399226907|5.0|First and most important: Baby loves the book.<br />Secondly: This is a great story that includes elements of counting, learning the days of the week, learning about different types of food, and about the caterpillar life-cycle.<br />Thirdly: If baby gets real wiggly, it's easy to summarize quickly: Caterpillar is born.  Caterpillar PIGS OUT.  Caterpillar gets stomach ache. Caterpillar builds cocoon.  Butterfly emerges.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|To borrow an Americanism, I cannot help but be far out in the left field as far as this movie is concerned. I saw this movie in the theatre a while ago and frankly couldn't understand what the fuss was all about. <br />Bill Murray gives another deadpan performance and Scarlett Johansson is impressive in her role as newly wedded (but ignored) bride. Yes, they are feeling rather alienated and are bored out of their minds (for whatever reason) in this city that seems to be teeming with life (and myriad forms of entertainment). Granted, some people will bored regardless of their surroundings, but does a movie about them have to be boring too? <br />Or perhaps, it's an inside joke: a boring movie about boring people, who are themselves bored. In yours truly's opinion, just as the title aptly puts it, there's something &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;...
B00003CXSM|1.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law, who proceeded to  tear it apart.  Although I secretly agreed, I was embarrased to say so, since I bought it as a gift for her (and of course you cant agree with your mother-in-law)...<br />Here's the Plot: JLo falls for &quot;hottie&quot; doctor, plans his wedding, and steals him away from the soon-to-be wife.  And everyone's OK with this.  What is this?<br />Watch for yourself, but I'd recommend saving your money and doing something useful with your time like tweezing hairs from hard-to-reach places.
0385504209|5.0|This is the best book I've read since Angela's Ashes.  I totally recommend it.
0385507755|5.0|What a stunning debut.  It was a brutal, graphic, heartbreaking illustration of the life of an addict and one man's quest to be something more.  I liked that Frey illustrated unblinkingly what he'd done without trying to make himself seem likeable and endearing.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I hadn't really cared much for this type of music until I heard Jet's CD.  Not only are the lyrics catchy, but the music is upbeat and puts you in a good mood.  I'm Very excited to hear what they have next.  Those guys rock and I recommend you to buy this CD.  It is DEFF. worth every dime.
006016848X|3.0|Well I have checked out the mentioned sites in an earlier review and it appears to be true that Mr. Gray has no credentials whatsoever.  More over the book tends to go on and on and at points you get so bored you just can't read more than 2-4 pages at a time.  HOWEVER, there are some interesting things in there that make you think... &quot;yeah, guys do act like that somtimes&quot; or &quot;yeah, I, as a woman, feel that way at times&quot;.  I believe this book gives you a glimps of male-female relationships and can help you get an idea of how you can handle such a relationship when it is struggling.  I wouldn't go as far as calling this book The Bible of Relationships, but I do believe reading it is beneficial, and would not be a waste of time or money.  I think it would be a good idea for a couple to read this book together.  You might disagree with a few parts, you might find other parts downright silly, but for the most part, you will find this book quite helpful.
1401300901|5.0|This book lives up to all the excellent reviews it has received. Both funny and sad, this young author writes as though she has written many books already. I found myself saying I would read ten pages, then stayed up a little later to read a couple more. It is an inspirational story and very cleverly written. GREAT!
B00006AG5N|5.0|I can understand completely those who oppose the &quot;modernization&quot; of Evlis' music and the &quot;digitalization&quot; that must have altered his voice some.  I understand that when they listen to this, they want to be able to go back to the good old 50s and 60s.  However, to those of us who weren't around until the late 70s, it's more a matter of discovering Elvis for the first time.  I must say, if I hear the orignal Elvis albums I most likely would not be interested enough to even listen to one song.  But when I got this CD as a present, I just couldn't get enough of it.  Still can't!  This is the very first time I listen to Elivs and now I am a huge fan.  The CD is wonderful, the sound quality is perfect, and the songs are varied and very enjoyable.  I espcially like &quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; and &quot;Hard Headed Woman&quot;.  But gosh, I can't really say I have a favorite song cuz all of it is just great!  So what I'm saying is, for those of you who are still discovering Elvis, this is a great CD to start with.
B00006FDCD|4.0|I like this movie, across its from Stephen king, it has to be good.It was.Him and Freddy has something in common, the both funny.
B000099T2L|1.0|It's not her fault pop music has become an industry of looks rather than talent.. .but she's certainly using it to her advantage.
B00006IU73|5.0|One year and two months ago I didn't realize that something like Porcupine Tree existed. When my friend first told me about their new record, I was very sceptical. However, I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I borrowed &quot;In Absentia&quot; from him. Well, I could listen to it once... <br />Then I played the first song... I couldn't believe my own ears. It crushed me, pressed me into the ground. It showed me a totally different side of music (I don't claim that there is nothing else worth mentioning - but these sounds perfectly synchronized with all my cells). I was overwhelmed by the beauty emited from every tone.<br />&quot;Ia Absentia&quot; shows the great diversity of moods. Listen to &quot;Trains&quot; and &quot;Strip the soul&quot;. The first one is harmonic, almost classical. The latter is permeated with dark and mysterious atmosprhere. These two aspects are perfectly combined in &quot;Blackest eyes&quot;. On the other hand, both &quot;Lips of ashes&quot; and &quot;Gravity eyelids&quot; hupnotizing. Hidden voices, hard sounds, astonishing guitar riffs (&quot;Sound of muzak&quot;) and subtle piano tunes (&quot;Collapse the light into Earth&quot;) are still only a beginning of this fascinating journey called &quot;In Absentia&quot;.<br />I'm now the great Porcupine Tree fan and I recommend all their records. I have told many people about Steven Wilson &amp; company. Believe me - most of them were simply enchanted. They couldn't believe that this kind of music is overlooked. It's not only my opinion - Porcupine Tree is ONE OF THE GREATEST CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS!!!
B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips are not our savior, but they do their best.  Unlike most others who have been following the Lips for ten years or more, I really enjoyed this album.  They are staying on the cutting edge of music, and if you want Flaming Lips from ten years ago, you have the album, go play it.
B000002UDB|5.0|I am in a minority but this has always been my favorite despite one or two tracks that I'm not wild about. Strictly speaking, this is actually a compilation, being made up of the tracks from the soundtrack EP plus the A and B-sides of various singles. However, as none of these tracks appeared on any other original Beatles albums, it is classified as an original album. - Because it was not recorded as an album, it sounds less cohesive than some of the other Beatles albums but the strength of the songs more than compensates for that.<br />Taking the soundtrack songs first, three of them are outstanding - Fool on the hill (a song that has been covered by others, sometimes brilliantly), Your mother should know (a fun song, as true today as it ever was) and the theme song. I can never make up my mind about I am the walrus. It is a piece of nonsense but it is very well done. Only John Lennon could have recorded such a song and not been ridiculed for it. There are times when I really enjoy it and there are times when I think it is rubbish. You must make up your own mind. Flying (an instrumental) and Blue jay way (a George Harrison song) are decent but nothing special.<br />The singles tracks are, of course, all masterpieces. The only B-side, Baby you're a rich man, is less famous than the other tracks but it's a classic as far as I'm concerned. You need no introduction to the four A-sides (Hello goodbye, Strawberry fields forever, Penny Lane, All you need is love) - you've heard them all countless times or you wouldn't even be thinking about buying this album.<br />Others may cite Sergeant Pepper, Abbey road or Revolver as their favorite Beatles album. I love them all, but not as much as this one.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I cannot describe how much I have fallen in love with the Mars Volta.  Their music may be a little too experimental for some to get into at first, but listen to it a couple times.  Once it catches you, you'll be hooked.  If you like Radiohead, At the Drive In, Led Zeppelin, or Santana--hell, if you have any taste in music at all--you'll love this album.<br />This is a great concept album about Julio Venegas, a friend of the band who committed suicide in 1996.  The album follows a semi-fictionalized plot where the hero tries to commit suicide by overdosing on morphine, but instead goes into a coma, where he experiences fantastic lucid dreams.  Upon waking up from the coma at the end, he chooses to die.  While the exact plot remains somewhat obscure, the general themes run throughout the album.<br />The Mars Volta are one of those bands that you just have to hear to believe.  They have a jaw-dropping potential for greatness.  It ought to be a crime not to hear them.
B00000F1D3|4.0|Cher's massive comeback album BELIEVE is a pretty good collection of dance songs with positive messages of strength through hard times. The title track brought Cher back and was a mega hit, helping the album sell millions worldwide. It was played EVERYWHERE in late 1998/1999 for a long time to come. I was never tired of it though, it's a great song. The second single was the disco infused \\"Strong Enough\\", not a favorite of mine but another positive song with a great underlying message. \\"All Or Nothing\\" was my favorite single, but it didn't really catch on. That song just does something to me, but it's just amazing. Great song! \\"D'ove L'amore\\" was also a single, and the remixes were quite nice. Actually, all the remixes for the singles during this era were exceptionally well done. I never cared much for \\"The Power\\", that's one I usually skip over, but the rest of the album is great. We have a new remix version of \\"We All Sleep Alone\\", which has always been one of my favorite Cher songs. \\"Takin Back My Heart\\" has a similar theme that \\"Strong Enough\\" does, and \\"Runaway\\" has a similar sentiment too. All great songs though. \\"Taxi Taxi\\" is nice, a bit odd, sounds more like a b-side track though. Overall, a really solid collection of songs from the divine Cher!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye comes hard and give the people a great cd to listen to all the was through. Great Job
B0001AP12G|5.0|There isnt good hip hop anymore, with the exeption of this album. The most anticipated album by a producer ever. When &quot;this cant be life&quot; came out in 2000 on Jay Z's dynasty album,I couldn't wait more to hear more from this man. Thanks to Timbaland, the Neptunes, Kanye, we now ask who produced the track on every new song.There's heat on this album such as &quot;jesus walks&quot; and &quot;never let me down&quot; featuring jigga. Its a great buy and worth your hard earned dollars. Who made the blueprint a classic banger- your boy kanye.Dude can rap too.
B00004YKUY|5.0|After having listened to this album the second time I just have to agree that this album is probably one of their best ever so far.<BR>I am a huge Journey fan myself and have been following this band from the very start basically.<BR>The new Steve sings even better then the ol' Perry ever did.<BR>Keep up the good work guys....
0393325172|3.0|This book has a very similar story line from the Horatio Hornblower's series (I think it was the book &quot;Hornblower and the Hotspur&quot;)I have read all of the C.S. Forester books and when I purchased this book I could not believe how similar the story line is.  Instead of Lt Bush you have LT Dillion, Hornblower and Aubry have the same qualities and the both meet the good DR. the same way.  I will check out the next book as see if I experience deja vu
B0001AP12G|5.0|Well my title explains it all like i said From beats to mixtapes now rhymin.Starting with hot songs like h to the izzo Kanye was made to be a genius like jay-z mentioned in the begginig of lucifer.He is bringing something different to rap with his rnb beats something simular to the diplomats.<BR>Although there is a review that says that he isnt a good spitter well he isnt that bad and u dont find many artists who can spit n make hot beats so u gotta give him props for that now i know everybody is going to be like what about Dre ya he is one of them.Mixtapes: there were hot songs like 'the good the bad and ugly which we all thought would make it to the album but they were bangin on mixtapes. p.s Some could hate but kanye is great from h to the izzo,girls girls girls,stand up,through the wire,slow jamz,and the unknown classic by talib Kweli-Get by
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I really wanted to like it. I love Bill Murray's acting but this movie never gets started...and maybe that's the point...but it's still no fun to watch.  It is a strangely compelling flick but in the same vein as a still life tableau.  I've also never been so aware of screen changes as I was with this movie, because the scenes don't seem to flow and instead come across as an arrhythmic collage with rather random syntax. With this in mind, it might be more satisfying to put the scenes from the movie on a PC as a screensaver! In the end, however, it would probably be as maddening as the movie. Given the awards frenzy, I just can't help but think that the public has been led down the garden path by the Hollywood establishment promoting one of its own.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West's new cd is a perfect example of what Hip Hop was meant to be.  He has something real to say, and the guest artists such as Saul williams reflect this.  College dropout is as thought provoking as it is easy to bounce to.  Definately worth checking out.
B00005JL9B|5.0|This is a must! I love chinese and japanese cinema and I think BATTLE ROYALE is one of the best movie I own in my collection. This is scary, but in a different way: I mean, there are no zombies or ghosts or monsters... but students... and they must kill each other! I mean this could be much real than a zombie and I think for a human being this would be scarier (like being buried alive... brrrr). Anyway Takeshi Kitano is contributing to make cinema greater
B00005R87Q|1.0|this is the epitome of the movies I hate.  Essentially plotless, unless you consider car chase plot, this is a hour and a half long commercial for sport tuning your car.  The story line is completely un-believable, the characters are un-believable, and the ONLY saving grace of this movie is that it's got \\"pretty cars\\" and \\"bright lights.\\"
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I don't know the answer, but I didn't enjoy the DVD.  I can find almost anything in a movie that will make me want to watch it again, but honestly, I'd just like to sell my copy of this one.  I resent some of these reviews where the people who loved it are calling those of us who didn't stupid for not seeing the brilliance.  I'm not stupid and I suspect that the only people who really saw anything deep in this movie were those who were on drugs, or who had very, very active imaginations.<br />The filming and sound are good, the acting was pretty good but as far as plot, humor, empathy or interest in characters - I didn't see much if any and I just couldn't wait for it to end.  Boring, depressing, confusing.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I'm a picky moviegoer, but I like movies.  I'm also a picky comic book reader, but I like comic books.  There are precious few comic book-BASED movies that can stay true to the original storyline and retain a quality movie.  This was one of them (the Original Michael Keaton-starring Batman was good too).<br />The opening scenes of X2 were gripping as they introduced you to Kurt Wagner, the Nightcrawler.  He's got the mutant power to &quot;bampf&quot; or teleport into a cloud of smoke.  Beyond that, just watch the opening scene... It's great.<br />The story for X2 is loosely based on the Graphic Novel, God Loves, Man Kills.  I'm not completely familiar with the novel, so I can't argue how true to the story the movie was, but I liked the way that this was done.  It introduced &quot;new&quot; mutants to people in certain scenes, and dropped hints towards future people who will be in movies. <br />It was good for the average watcher too, as the original X-men movie went into the introductions to characters, while this one was more story driven.<br />I can't rave enough about the quality of this movie, especially after the disappointing &quot;Daredevil&quot; movie and somewhat disappointing &quot;Spider-man&quot; movie (I don't like when a character's origin from the comic books is basically SLAUGHTERED).
0385504209|3.0|I got a few pages into the da vinci code when i realized i was<br />supremely annoyed at the writing style.  I mean sure the information is interesting, but the format of 3 lines of conversation followed by 'Sophia knew that...'  and jumping into a paragraph of internal explanation.  It's not even presented as internalized thought. The book would of been much more interesting if it had taken place as a conversation, rather than a bunch of factual (or semi-facutal) asides.  I gave it three stars for the info alone. I also agree with the Eco quote in another comment. A similar one is the Law of Fives. The Law of Fives states simply that: All things happen in Fives, or are divisible by or are multiples of Five, or are somehow directly or indirectly appropriate to 5.  substitute Mary M.  for Five and you've got the da vinci code.
0385510438|5.0|As usual, Grisham doesn't disappoint, whether it's a legally-based thriller, a down-home &quot;Painted House&quot; or any of his other great reads.  At least there's some consistancy in this world.  Also liked &quot;The Firm,&quot; &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; &quot;A Child called It.&quot;
B00005JMCN|2.0|I hope this doesn't signal Jeff Bridge's ride into the sunset.  There is surprisingly little dialog in this movie - mostly just history-channel style narration between TV-commercial quality moments of action.  The cinematogrophy is excellent on the track, it's way too artifical off it.  Better rented than owned.

B0000714BP|4.0|One year after the success of the 1994 Australian film \\"The Adventures Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\\", Amblin Entertainment and Universal Pictures joined to produce the 1995 American version, \\"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\\".  Like the Australian film, which featured a trio of drag queens traveling across the rugged Australian outback from Sydney to the isolated resort of Alice Springs in a pink bus, the American version featured its own drag queen trio traveling from NYC to Los Angeles in an aging yellow Cadillac convertible; but the similarities end there. The drag queen trio featured in the American version was Miss Noxeema Jackson (Wesley Snipes), Miss Vida Boheme (Patrick Swayze) and Miss Chi-Chi Rodriguez (John Leguizamo).  After Noxeema and Vida share the title of a drag queen contest, they invite (with Noxeema's reluctance) Chi-Chi to join them to participate in a national contest in Los Angeles.  Not having enough money for all three to fly to Los Angeles from NYC, Vida convinces them to instead use their winnings to purchase a car that all three could travel in.  The film's title comes from an autographed picture of Julie Newmar that Vida steals from a restaurant and places in the used yellow Cadillac convertible that the trio purchases.  Similar to the Australian version, the car breaks down along the way, forcing the trio to stay a few days in a small, languishing town.  There, they meet the town's assorted residents that include hotel owner Carol Ann (Stockard Channing), her abusive husband Virgil (Arliss Howard), Beatrice (Blythe Danner), the polite Bobby Ray (Jason London), Merna (Melinda Dillon), Loretta (Beth Grant), the aging Clara (Alice Drummond) and restaurant owner Jimmy Joe (Mike Hodge) to name a few. They also meet law enforcement officer Sheriff Dollard (Chris Penn) who wants to arrest them.<br />Though arguably not as well made as \\"The Adventures Priscilla, Queen of the Desert\\", \\"To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! JulieNewmar\\" is still a very entertaining and engaging film that is sufficiently different from the former to not be redundant.  Cameo appearances in the film include Julie Newmar, Robin Williams (as John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt), RuPaul (as Miss Rachel Tensions) and Naomi Campbell.  Memorable scenes in the film include the restaurant, the used car lot, Vida seeing her mother (Margaret H. Flynn), Chi-Chi earning rites of passage, Sheriff Dollard, Noxeema's interactions with townsfolk, the clothing store, the beauty parlor and the closing scenes.  Patrick Swawye received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actor in a Comedy/Musical, and John Leguizamo received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actor in the Comedy/Musical.  Sadly, Wesley Snipes did not receive a nomination for his excellent performance.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  After watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, I concluded that they were best left deleted.
B00003CXTG|3.0|Well what can you say the movie was great and bad at the same time. Being former military I have to say the love triangles and emotional part of the movie was a breath of fresh air, because I think more often than not people focus on the blood and guts of combat which is pretty much the realistic view of war, when most have not experienced or even come close to living or walking that path. A soldier is not just a killer seeing something in a movie besides our boys being blown to hell to me is not wrong or bad for a movie.  Yet the way it was handled in this movie I just dont know. Historicaly speaking it was some what accurate give or take changeing a few identities into benwhoflec and butchering the real life army air corps pilots who took to the sky, just remember that it was not ben and josh who flew that day. Visual affects for the Pearl attack scene were done well, yet I guess contradicting myself I dont think they lived up to the brtality of the combat that took place that day. All in all it was a movie in my opinion worth seeing I think any movie about our boys is worth seeing to many people seem to forget this day in age why this country is still here becasue of the men in the uniform. So i guess this turned into more of a history/political review but I felt I shold put in my 2 cents.
0767802470|5.0|A classic. Must have for a film buff.<br />The movie opens with the graphic - 40,000 German submariners went out on U boats during WWII. 30,000 never came back. Das Boot explains why. At 200+ minutes, Das Boot can drag at times. As can life on a submarine. I've heard is best described as &quot;Long Periods of boredom broken up by moments of shear terror&quot;.<br />Filmed inside a WWII submarine (no cutaway sets) the film gives the veiwer a feeling of the closed in space that I've never seen.<br />The sound was pretty good on the home theater and the depth charges probably woke the neighbors.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Ok, almost everybody knows that this movie rocks! If you don't think so, you didn't get the meaning of the movie. I will not talk about the movie itself because I am sure many of you out there seen it for milliion times. But if you must really know what the movie is all about, read the reviews of others.<br />But I would like to talk about the DVD itself. First of all, the new surround sound system is AWESOME. It gives you better experience watching this old movie. The sound people for this new dvd release did a hack of good job. Two thumbs way up. And also the quality of the picutres are awesome. The picture is so clean, you think this movie is just released in theater. It is totally quatum leap from VHS version.<br />The extra feature of this movie is also awesome. It goes into detail about the movie and how they got around the corner to save much money as possible making this movie. It's also funny. You will learn lots of new trivia details of this movie too. I am glad I waited this long to get the special edition of this movie.<br />Oh, and the disc of this dvd is double sided. so becareful not to scratch it :)
B00018D44U|4.0|Well I must say that I was a bit worried when my favorite artist of 2003 was coming out with a new album. But no need to worry I now have two CD's that I put in the player and just chill. This CD transports me to a totally different place. <br />I really like the background vocals on Be Here To Love Me. Also I think there is a lot more music on this CD than the other. We really get to hear allot of The Handsome Band's talent. <br />Go buy it now you won't be disappointed! Oh and dolly on Track 7 is just an awesome surprise, classic!
B00008PC2O|4.0|From a geek's perspective, T2 extreme is somewhat groundbreaking - groundbreaking in the extra format on disc #2.  Granted, the format is something only an extremist might be interested in, but it was worth the $15 walmart was charging.  The format on disc #2 is 1080/24p (not 1080i).  Also, the sound streams are in 24/96k format - also well beyond the call of duty.  There is a downside to such a format - it needs a special, software-based, playback app.<br />Disc #2, with the special encoding, is probably the only reason to buy this version of T2, and only buy it if you have a serious machine which can play back such an extreme encoding smoothly.<br />I gave it 4 stars because many people probably (a) won't have a decent enough monitor to appreciate the new format in, and/or probably (b) won't have fast enough hw to play it back smoothly with.  But if you do have both, it is a slick format (again, in an &quot;early adopter&quot; sort of way).
B0001AP12G|4.0|Rap has been in a little funk for a while on. Its got to the point where its almost unbearable to listen to what these guys have to say.  Plus most of their albums are not even worth the bandwidth to listen to them before coping it.  It is a pleasure to hear an album well done as kanye's.  The beats are extremely hot and the songs are great.  Although i did not like the fact that he continually made fun of people who went to college.  It was masterfully done. my favorites are jesus walks, through the wire, family business &amp; all falls down.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This musical masterpiece captured the essence of what Hip-hop WAS all about.  Mos Def was right, this man is THE FUTURE.  College Dropout is a headbanger throughout.  Clever lyricism, superb delivery, and cold production makes this piece an instant classic!  Fast forward 15 years...I'll be playing this for my kids so they can experience what real music feels like.  Thanks Kanye for saving the Game.  Folks don't get it twisted, you don't have to be bashful to do things the Chi way!  Peace
B00005OWEG|5.0|Great war period drama/action thriller that was a huge sucess in the box office. Best lineup of hollywood star actors, award winning director and a huge winning movie worldwide. A definite classic.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This is a pretty good adaptation of the first of the five Harry Potter books and for the most part it's pretty enjoyable. <br /> This movie is of a young boy named Harry Potter who lives with his mean-spirited relatives The Dursleys in Little Whinging after his parents were murdered and has live a hellish 11 years of his life under their mistreatment of him. Harry however, learns about his past and discovers the ability to create magic with the use of a wand and goes to a magic school called Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and a whole new world awaits him. <br /> Harry learns that his parents were killed by an evil wizard named Lord Voldemort and now that he's returning, Voldemort is after a legendary artifact called the Sorcerer's Stone to give him eternal life. Harry Potter now has to stop Voldemort from getting ahold of the stone. <br /> This movie for the most part is really good but while it's good, it's kind of drags on a bit in places and is boring in some areas too but is a lot of fun. The sequel &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; though is a lot better but this first one is a decent start.
B000094A6B|1.0|Only one thing was funny about this movie. The rope stuck to the penises of nerds wanting in on a famous frat house, thats it. I suspected that since will farrel was in this it would be funny, but at the end the out come was, short and boring. On a scale from one to ten i would give it a 0.

B00005JKED|4.0|Denzel's outstanding preformance brought him home an oscar for best actor in a leading role in this fresh new thriller that kept us waiting for a decade to come out. It's so unpredictable and thats what makes it a classic thriller. The cast is great and the storyline makes sense beyond what we imagined it to be. This is a must see movie.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I think the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best rock bands of the 90's, easily.  Billy Corgan has become one of my favorite guitarists recently.  His work on the studio albums is brilliant, layering guitar upon guitar with brilliant riffs and awesome solos.  <br />His lyrics are often depressed and angry, but they show hope and beauty too.  Lyrics aren't usually as important to me as music, but Billy Corgan writes good ones, in my opinion.  <br />\\"Cherub Rock\\" opens up with a simple clean guitar playing the main riff.  Within less than a minute, a wall of guitars is hitting you, but it's still extremely listenable.  The melodies of this song are awesome, and I'd bet you've heard it on the radio.  \\"Quiet\\" is a assault of layered metal riffs.  \\"Today\\" is another radio song.  It's one of the weaker songs on the whole, but I think it's still pretty nice.  \\"Hummer\\" is nearly 7 minutes long, with several different parts and great textures and melodies.  \\"Disarm\\" is a beautiful acoustic guitar and vocal track, with strings added (that are good and not cheesy).  \\"Soma\\" starts with a peaceful clean guitar riff, but explodes into a wall of distorted guitars and wild leads.  \\"Geel U.S.A.\\" is one of the best rockers, and one of the most layered.  I don't know how many guitars are in this song, but I'm pretty sure it's more than 12 or so.  The solo is wildly energetic, and the metal riffs are awesome.  \\"Mayonaise\\" is gorgeous and noisy at the same time.  There are no bad songs.<br />When I first got into the Pumpkins, I didn't like Billy Corgan's voice that much, but I've grown to love it...I dunno.  The wall of sound created by Billy Corgan's guitars combined with his original voice and songwriting is also backed up by the experienced drumming of Jimmy Chamberlain.  He used to be in a jazz band apparently, and the guy definitely knows what he's doing.<br />If you want my opinion (I guess you do, if you've read this far), this is one of the best rock albums of the 90's, and you should buy it.  Highly recommended.
B0000A7W14|5.0|This is one of the greatest african american movies out there. Truth about everyday lives of black people strggling in the infamous south central. Cuba, cube and fishburne deliever an outstanding preformance of what really goes on in the hood. I recomended it to anyone who love african american stuggle drama, i'd rate it a 10/10. Watch this movie, its a definite.
B00006RU5B|5.0|These guys are so talented. Cornell's vocals and lyrics are outstanding! Tom Morello really needs more recognition for what he can do with a guitar also. He can make this sound that I've never heard before. He's honestly the best guitar player in music today. The bass lines and drums are still about the same as they were in Rage, so that's cool too. This group of guys just mesh well together, that's about all you can say. They are gonna take over the rock industry and be king for a long time so get used to it. Someone needs to take charge and bring rock back to the top of the charts, and they have all the intangibles to do just that. THey have a sound that you have to hear for yourself. Fans of Rage and Soundgarden should really buy this album because two great bands have fused and become a better band. Check it out for yourself, form your own opinion, and enjoy this wonderful band!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Sofia Coppola follows up her lovely film The Virgin Suicides with this gem of a film, Lost In Translation. For someone such as myself who passionately loathes the tedium and banality of mainstream Hollywood romantic comedies, Lost In Translation is a godsend. It doesn't waste time on a useless, predictable plot like so many romantic movies; this film is out to give the viewer an emotional experience. One thing I love is the way it's shot in a very realistic, almost documentary-like style. The characters feel like real people, not merely big stars who are just collecting a paycheck. The dialog feels truly genuine. That's what impressed me the most the first time I saw it. The dialog is real. It doesn't feel forced or phony and neither do the excellent performances. Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray are truly perfect in their roles as two lonely souls who find each other amid the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. The film tells us much about the characters using visuals. We see Bob and Charlotte spending time by themselves, searching for something or someone, perhaps. They meet and soon become friends, finding that they are in similar situations. In a place that is foreign to both of them, all they have is each other. <br />In a typical Hollywood movie, things would be familiar and typical. There would be cheap jokes, predictable situations and obvious dialouge. Lost In Translation, however, always keeps things fresh. Bill Murray gives a splendid performance as the weary Bob Harris, who finds a real friend in Scarlett Johansson's lonely Charlotte. Sofia Coppola's direction is perfect. The film feels real. It never feels like a production. The characters feel just like real people. The backdrop of Tokyo forms a wonderful canvas for this story, and it is beautifully photographed.<br />Lost In Translation is a wonderful film that is sure to delight viewers who are tired of phony Hollywood romance. The film never panders to audience expectations. It keeps things fresh, original, honest and genuine. It is truly one of the best films of 2003.
B00018D44U|4.0|At the age of 22, Norah Jones saw herself being hailed as one of the most inspiring new artist to come along in 2002. Her ''Come Away With Me'' album scored millions of record sales, then followed by numerous awards, including several Grammy Awards. <BR>''Come Away With Me'' had all the right ingredients to become a sure hit-the moody sound, lovely piano playing and a stricking voice to accompany it all. Indeed a star was born.<br />The follow-up is always a tough one. People will expect more of the same thing and perhaps something better. ''Feels Like Home'' continues the patterm set by ''Come Away With Me. ''Feels Like Home'' sounds just as fresh and gentle as her former record. Norah Jones and her band have swifted towards an more ''Blues/country'' inspired sound and it works extremely well alongside Norah Jones vocals<br />The country sound is most evident on the Dolly Parton duet ''Creppin' In'', a cathcy and enjoyable song. ''Sunrise is another gem and one of the best songs on the album. ''Toes'' is a droll song with its brezzy and dreamy sound. ''Canival Town'' displays Norah Jones and The Handsome Band wholesome sound. '' The Prettiest Thing'' is a sure winner and among my absolute faves on ''Feels Like Home''. ''Humble Me'' and ''In The Morning'' are also worth a mention. Both are seductive within your fist listen and they are sure to become faves among many listeners.<BR>''Don't Miss You At All'' contains the music from Duke Ellingtons' ''Melancholia'', while Norah Jones has re-written the lyrics to the song. Using only the piano and a sampling from ''Melancholia'', the song is easily one of the best songs on ''Feels Like Home''.<br />If you enjoyed ''Come Away With Me'', you might like ''Feels Like Home'' as well. If you are looking for something completely different than ''Come Away with Me'' you won't find it. Innovate and groundbeaking music it isn't, however if you enjoy some mellow music every now and then ''Feel Like Home'' is a good buy. <br />Overall Rate: 8/10
B00006CXXU|4.0|The great moment had began yesterday. Christina knock up the audience with her Voice Within' sung &quot;Beautiful&quot;. No doubt why Grammy suddenly push this award on her hand. Someone who even laugh at her inner &amp; outside would think it twice. Her Voice with power and anger that made her success. Beautiful was predicted for achieve the biggest awards last year 2003, but still successful in this year 2004. A few years ago, I was predicted that she would recieved the best new artist, now she can prove it that she must desereve it now!!!<br />Overall, the album still in the darkness of woman who want to be on the top. Exhale and say &quot;Yes, no matter what, no man I must still alive&quot;. This album go along with people especially woman who need a friend and never bring you down, she could heal your soul, beauty and naughty with her songs. (Maybe)<br />Sometimes she made us wants to slap on her face but the kiss also. What she did with Janet that unacceptable, Janet doesn't desevere it. Stop pushin' her!<br />So, Christina Shut up, stop Dirrty and sing yo! (Somehow we still love you)<br />Congratuation, Ms Aguilera.
B00005JKDR|5.0|\\"Monsters Inc\\" gets my nod as my favorite of the trainload of CGI animated features that Pixar has brought forth during this great time for animated movies versus the awful period for music. \\"Toy Story\\" paved the way for these movies but I never thought it would happen but \\"Monster's Inc\\" does the unthinkable, it actually surpasses \\"Toy Story\\" not only in the excellent animation but also of groundbreaking graphics (Sully's Fur) and of a really, REALLY original story idea. I guess it's safe to say that this movie made me conquer my fear of going into the closets at night and if there are monsters, I'm no longer afraid of them. Just for a little humor. I haven't laughed so hard the way I did with seeing \\"Monster's Inc\\" and it's hard not to see why. That's why I love Pixar's movies. They aim for all ages from young children to elderly audiences and \\"Monsters Inc\\" is the best of them all alongside \\"Finding Nemo\\". The whole story plot idea is unbelievably original and unsurpassed by many movies since this one.<br />It all begins with a typical night with a monster who aims to scare a sleeping child by creeping out of the closet. The whole thing goes awry and turns out to be a simulation and we discover the reasons why monsters actually come out of closets and scare the children of the human world. The Monsters scare the children because they need to collect the children's screams to a utility power plant where the screams generate electricity for their city of Monstropolis. However the city of Monstropolis is facing a looming power shortage because the children of the human world are becoming harder and harder to scare and thus brownouts are becoming more and more commonplace, threatening the very well being of the monster world. The problems don't stop there. While the top scarer of the monster crew James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) continues his winning streak as the number one scarer, a nemesis co-worker named Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) is also causing some headaches. The CEO of the company Henry J. Waternoose is also ready to use any means to keep his company from collapsing from the power crisis gripping Monstropolis.<br />The main storyline though is of a much more chaotic incident. According to Waternoose's warnings, the humans possibly carry germs that may be deadly for monsters to become infected with and the crews take drastic measures to avoid getting touched by the humans that they try to scare. One night, as Sullivan is going to turn in his assistant Mike Wazowski's paperwork and finds a door that is activated. He opens it and unaware of it, a toddler escapes through the door and right into the monster factory. Unable to get her back into her right bedroom, Sullivan attempts to disguise her but fails and as utter pandemonium follows, and vast numbers of C.D.A. (Child Detection Agency) decontamination units scouring the city for the missing child, Sullivan along with his longtime friend Mike Wazowski are on a long quest to get Boo home without being caught by the C.D.A. Sully and Mike however are unaware that they have several enemies that are working within their own ranks which make their mission to return Boo home more complicated and more dangerous.<br /> The computer generated animation effects are absolutely breathtaking in just aobut every way you look at it. The animation effects of Sullivan's turquoise blue fur is so well done that it looks almost like actual live footage of a costume. Even the movements look incredibly lifelike and the details in the movie are just incredible! This movie is just about perfect in so many ways. If there is any quibble I have aobut this movie, it's that it's only 90 minutes long. Perhaps I'm spoiled at the movie lengths after seeing the Lord of The Rings movies but I think \\"Monsters Inc\\" should've been at least two hours long for more fun but that's just my opinion.<br /> The actors selected for the voices perfectly match the personalities of the characters they provided the voice work for. The late James Coburn perfectly fitted the elderly role of the longtime elder Henry J. Waternoose, CEO of the Monsters Incorporated Company which his family has owned for three generations and it's really sad that Coburn moved on so soon after such a great movie. My favorite of all is of John Goodman who provides the stadium sized voice of the great James P. Sullivan, the top scarer of the Monsters Inc. workforce. He sounds so incredibly funny when he screams especially during when he discovers Boo has escaped into the factory. Billy Crystal is incredibly awesome playing Sullivan's constantly agitated assistant and lifelong friend Mike Wazowski and his voice is perfectly especially when Wazowski is uptight about things. Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs, Jennifer Tilly as Celia, they're all great.<br /> While younger viewers will certainly have a great time with the charm factor of this movie, older audiences will likely get a truly good message of about how even fearsome-looking creatures or human beings can in reality turn out being very gentle and caring beings who wouldn't even hurt a fly. And while I don't believe that monsters necessarily exist in most places, this movie also explains the reasons why monsters do this, scaring the daylights out of the sleeping children, they need their screams to power their cities but the monsters are just as scared of the children as the children are of them.<br /> Enough said, go and buy this DVD as soon as you can. This is one of the greatest animated movies that has ever been made and the crew behind it's conception deserve the utmost praise for it's creation.voice work for.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|I was lucky enough to see this film in its 2003 restoration - with the full original soundtrack - in a boutique cinema. The only other version I have seen is the Moroder version.<BR>Watching this film as it was originally shown is silent movie bliss. The soundtrack, which I expected to be rather weak and &quot;old fashioned&quot;, turned out to be every bit as exciting and dramatically orchestrated as any modern film - and of course it is newly recorded in Dolby Surround! <BR>Of course, this is the film that was butchered by studios just like Abel Gance's &quot;Napoleon&quot;. Unlike Abel Gance's &quot;Napoleon&quot; we will probably never, ever see this film completely restored. The company that restored this film in 2003 must have been through a great deal, finding as many of the remaining fragments as possible, to reconstruct this film to the best level of completeness possible.<BR>Alas, many scenes were still missing. Alas, they will probably remain missing. This version provides text summaries for the (now much fewer) remaining gaps in the story. It is much more comprehensible than any previous version; the storyline may still suck, but at least it's much more coherent!<BR>The restorers also redid many of the special effects using original elements - my favourite is the infinite streams of slaves making the Tower of Babel! - and also restored the image so that it literally looks like a new film.<br />Overall, this film was quite an experience in the theatre. If only more silent classics were shown in such painstaking restorations!
B000002N2P|5.0|This is in my opinion the GREATEST PUNK CD EVER. Buy this NOW.  Everyone saying, &quot;They're not punk, they sold out, etc..&quot; is a bunch of crap.  Rancid made fun of them for signing to a major label and they did it themselves!! That just makes Green Day look a lot better than what people give them credit for.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I wasn't that impressed with &quot;The Last Samurai&quot;, but I have to admit that one of the few things that did impress me about the film was Hans Zimmer's beautiful and ethereal score.  Wow!  I have never been so manipulated by a film music composition -with the exception of James Horner's &quot;Bicentennial Man&quot; -that I listen to it almost every day so that this could pass as a guilty pleasure.  From the enchanting moments of the main theme, first heard in 'A Way Of Life' to the battle moments in 'Shadows In The Fog', to another enchanting moment when another major theme captures my feelings in the second half of 'A Hard Teacher' to the battle cries of the samurai as heard in 'Ronin'.<br />A touching album, no doubt.  As well as in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, Hans Zimmer knows what buttons to press in all of us listeners.  So sit back, try to listen to this CD at night, and enjoy.
B00005JKNC|5.0|This movie is my favorite Jim Carrey movie and it isn't even a comedy.  It potrays a great message about our freedoms and our rights as American citizens.  This movie is wonderfully cast, and just because it has political overtones doesn't make it any less of a movie.  Wonderful acting.  Best movie I saw in 2001.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Unbelivable. There are not many Albums where you can say that every song is a hit. Kanye ain't just a normal Hip Hop-Prodcuer.<BR>He works with Chors and so many different Rappers. That's almost wastefully. You'll be not disappointed in no song. It is worth to buy it. But attention: It's a new Way of Hip-Hop! It's not one of those Old-School Thangs (because Kanye is not experienced enough), and not one of these unneccessary Neptunes-Albums (The ones where Pharrell just takes himself an hour to make 'em). It's not east. It's not west....It's just Kanye West!
B000060P79|1.0|Well, I have listened to parts of this album, it's not very good. I just wanted to review because I wanted to be cool and bash a band like the &quot;punk&quot; fans on here. I want to fit in too :(
B00007L4MJ|2.0|It' a classic, no question about it. But is it really that great? I find it diffucult not to cheer at the evil Robot-Messiah turning the slave-workers into communists, destroying the machines and flooding the city, but I'm not sure that's the point. Hitler wept with emotion after the screening, actually he saw it on several occasions and declared it his favourite movie. McCarhthy would had wept too, if he knew anything about art. Well, I don't think the story or the ethics has made it a classic, rather the visuals, but apart from the transformation-scene they aren't really that impressive. The german expressionist-scene has made far superior movies, not half as celebrated as this one. I wonder why.<br />Fritz Langs own \\"M\\" is a much better movie, great visuals, intelligent script, great acting (in stark contrast to the silly twitching in this one), brilliant and disturbing - and made only four years after this hilariously overrated piece of hokum. Not to mention that the nazis hated it.
B00011RPB0|3.0|After watching Lost In Translation, I wanted to do two things: crawl into bed or go clubbing. I decided to hit the town. Both Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have the same choices: resign yourself to the negatives in your life or grab the bull by the horns. Contrasting dilemmas: Moving toward the end - midlife crisis vs. starting off on the bad foot - bad marriage. However, the strength of Lost in Translation (LIT) is that it works in stripping away their respective problems' details, runs them through a blender, and voila: you have two people who realize that their problems are quite similar. The only major difference being one of timing: one hasn't made the changes yet and procrastinates while the other still has the potential to change yet fears the outcome. The backdrop of Tokyo serves as the negativity amplifier in that it forces their dilemmas to surface faster than normal and with intensity.     Most already know the story where a has-been actor is sent to Tokyo alone to film some TV ads (real actors who have done so: Harrison Ford, Jodie Foster, Bruce Willis, Penelope Cruz, etc) while the other is accompanying her husband on a business trip. They meet up and being the lost souls that they are, make a connection. Both Murray and Johansson play their respective character with aplomb, especially Murray who while stoic at times, relies on subtle gestures to give life to his character. For one who is used to seeing him only in comedies, it was refreshing and perhaps indicates that he has more potential than we ever thought. Johansson on the other hand, seems to be on valium and though she still displays oodles of potential, her role in Ghost World to me was her breakout film. Then again, her character does spend most of her time in bed.     Lot's have been said about how LIT portrays Japan in a less than favorable light. Coming from a foreigner who has been living in Japan for close to a decade, I have to straddle the fence and say yes and no. It does provideevery stereotype of the Japanese and some are true while others are grossly exaggerated. The difficult part is trying to understand director Coppola's intent. I'm left feeling that since the two main characters are new to Japan and are in transition, the corresponding views/images on Japan in the movie should reflect the typical foreign misconceptions and stereotypes (Japanese are not good at English, Japanese women are airy and immature, Japanese men are a masculine joke, etc.) We are seeing Japan through their eyes not through ones of a Japanophile who is planning to live and work there. If that were the case, I think you would have seen a very different Japan. In that sense, the images of Japan and the Japanese are appropriate. They are for the most part, wrong, very wrong but appropriate. Just remind yourself of that when watching LIT. You're seeing Japan through the eyes of two lost people, Westerners who have very little interest in being there.     It was bit too slow for more liking and I was expecting a very different film image-wise from Coppola who so effectively used tones and colors in the Virgin Suicides. Though entertaining, I do question what the hype is all about. Truth is the setting could have been any foreign country (Japan being chosen because of the contrasts) and the result probably would have been the same because it's not the location as much as it the characters' fragile frames of minds that is the meat of the story.
B00009UW0N|2.0|John Carpenter is usually regardede as one of the great directors of the genre, but I find him terribly overrated. In the seventies and early eighties he had a good grip on suspense, his movies were mostly amateurish, but inciting. Today one would expect him to be a professional, but he's still directing pure dilettantism, lacking the enthusiasm of his earlier work.<br />Although Halloween is quite scary, in a somewhat childish but effective way, the ethichs are really the most terrifying thing about it, hilarious and monstrous at the same time: Teenagers, having fun in their parents beds, are butchered by a heavy-breathing retard wearing a Halloween-mask. Only the virtuous babysitting heroine survives this sexual-fascist Endl&ouml;sung. One would almost suspect that these kind of movies were made with the support of the Christian Right.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'd missed Firefly when it was aired on Fox, but picked up the box set on advice from several friends. Watched the whole thing over the weekend, simply captivated by how good it was. Here's hoping for a comparably good motion picture to wrap up some of the unfortunately unfinished story lines.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|Often underrated, this is Kubrick at his best. The cinematography is, of course, breathtaking, lavish and restrained at the same time. The Movie is a kind of orchestrated satire of the western formal rituals of violence and war, from the personal duel to the international battleground, where human beings are parading as cannon fodder. It's terribly appalling and terribly funny. Together with Paths of Glory (1957) and Full Metal Jacket (1987) it makes a monumental Kubrickesque War-trilogy.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This Album is great.  It's finally nice to see someone taking hip-hop to a much different level.  This album is not just about Guns and Girls like most other hip-hop albums.  Although, he does touch on those subjects the overall message in this album is different.  His flows are tight and the production is even better.  This will probably one of the best, if not the best album to come out this year.  This album is a must buy if you are even the slightest bit of a hip-hop fan.  You will definitely like it.
B00018D44U|5.0|High expectations are met. Norah knows what she has and what she can do and she does it so well. This is a great album and one I can tell will be listenable over and over. No obvious radio hits, but well crafted throughout and flows well.
0156027321|5.0|Please take note, I am a simple reader of horror books and adventure books.  King, Slade, Cussler, Rollins, and Preston and Child are my favorite authors.  I do not read much literature with a meaning.  With that, here's my review:<br />To say that this is my favorite book of all time would be an understatement.  After picking the book up, I was trying to figure out how the author would be able to fill up over 300 pages with a story of a tiger and a boy on the ocean.  Amazingly, he did it.  <br />The book is hard to put down.  With so much humor, action, and fun story telling it kept my attention to the very end.  Surprisingly, the author even had a few twists at the end.  And you are left asking yourself a question, to find the question, you have to read the book.
B000000WJZ|5.0|As much as I like &quot;Gish&quot;, I consider &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; to be their best album. The 2-disc &quot;Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness&quot; is amazing as well, but it's almost too much, and isn't solid front to back like this one is. This disc is power, and art, and beauty, and the epitome of alternative rock. Included is the excellent opener &quot;Cherub Rock&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;Spaceboy&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot;. And as good as those are, I actually love &quot;Soma&quot;, &quot;Rocket&quot;, &quot;Luna&quot;, and &quot;Geek USA&quot; even more. Track after track is incredible, and is what makes this one of the top five albums of the 1990's. Casual fans might get by with the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, but this is a must for everyone else. It's so &quot;Sweet Sweet&quot;.
0800141601|1.0|Okay.  I feel compelled to write a review because of all of the silliness in the other reviews.  Yes, there is a Melagant (or Meleagant) in Arthurian legends.  It is one of the oldest Arthurian legends to appear in the Romances (it's in Chretien's Lancelot).  He's a villain who abducts Guenevere.  <BR>That said, the movie strays as far from the Arthurian legends as possible.  At the end [SPOILER ALERT], Arthur dies and Lancelot rules Camelot with Queen Guenevere at his side.  Lancelot and Guenevere remain chaste until Arthur's death, however.  Oh, and Lancelot defeats some automatonic gauntlet thing.  This is worse than heresy.  It's like one of those 19th Century rewrites of Romeo and Juliet where Romeo and Juliet come back to life in the end to avoid a sad ending.<BR>There is an episode of the Simpsons where the Simpsons watch a Zorro remake.  At the end of that movie, after Zorro defeats the villanous Scarlet Pimpernel, King Arthur makes Zorro the King of England.  Watching this movie is an experience akin to what I imagine watching that movie would be.  You simply cannot tag on a happy ending to the Camelot story without being ridiculous.  This movie is ridiculous.
B00009TB5G|5.0|When it comes to trilogies, its rare to find one much better than the first. For LOTR Trilogy, its one of the rare.<br />I enjoyed the first LOTR: TFOTR Special Extended Edition DVD Set with the extras, the documentaries plus others (only dissapointed that there are no trailers) and with LOTR: TTT Special Extended Edition DVD Set, I never expect to enjoy even more.<br />With new deleted scenes and documentaries, your watching experience have become a whole lot much better compare to what you have enjoyed in theatres. And this is one of those DVDs I recommend to any fans out there to own it today.
0563214546|5.0|I received this book as a gift when living in the UK back in the 90's and it has proven to be one of my favorite and most trusted.  Delia's narration is what makes this very special, for example when she describes that her family comes from a long line of turkey farmers and then proceeds to share with us how to make the perfect bird utilizing varrying oven tempatures and foil pouch. The book reads like a novel and feels like it is notes from a friend's call on sharing a recipe. Very personal. The easy bernaise sauce is really easy and this combined with freshly grilled steak &amp; asparagus has become our staple for entertaining. This book is not for someone who just wants a technical cook book, this book has personality and will become your friend.
B0000VCZK2|4.0|Firstly, I'm a big fan of \\"ALIEN\\". What Ridley Scott did was superb. What James Cameron did was incredible. What David Finch did was a dissapointment. What Jean Pierre did was average.<br />But when it comes to this Quadrilogy boxset, I believe its enough even the last 2 movies were bad, its good to own the entire collection.<br />What more you want for that kind of price with 9 DVDs, almost 50 hours of extras, contents you'll never expect to see. And most of all, the extras, deleted/extended scenes, alternate scenes and trailers, galleries and all the cool stuff and the evolution of all four Alien movies.<br />This is one boxset to own if you're a fan, and its one boxset I believe you will enjoy as many times as you want to.
0385504209|4.0|I am slightly taken aback by some of the negative reviews here. This is a good book in my opinion. Yes, it's got some classic formulas, reads like a movie script, has some great tidbits of known conspiracy theories and yes the chapters are short and sweet... But if you want a great, fast and easy read that will keep you well entertained for a few days, then this book is for you. If you're looking for a complex novel with intricate characters and countless silly details that will take you a month to finish, then you'll be disapointed.<br />Give this book the credit it deserves. It has mass appeal, it is well written for what it is and the story is intriguing to those of us who have not read the book Holy Blood, Holy Grail. In fact, I found it to be a great introduction. I was actually quite surprised when I looked more closely at da Vinci's Last Supper fresco. John is not a man but indeed a woman. Anyone can see this. Does that mean Leonardo knew something we didn't? Perhaps but probably we'll never know. It's still a good mystery to me!<br />So all of you scullers from Oxford who are majoring in English, don't bother and don't write a critique here. For the rest of us mortals, this is a great read.
0061015725|5.0|I read this book in a single afternoon, which I don't usually do unless the book is really good, and I must say the story and characters were very strong and the science...nano-bots...was most intriguing. Making this book a Science-Fiction/High-Tech book like others I've bought and read, such as &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, and &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;. All damn good books and worthy to be added to anyone's Science-Fiction/High-Tech library.
B00018D44U|1.0|Not content to be the world's most dreary Jazz singer, Ms Jones has decided to give Country music her own 'dulls-ville' treatment.<br />I have heard this recording quite a few times now in my shop and I can honestly say that it is dull and unmemorable. I challenge anyone to 'connect' with the prosaic songs featured on this album. The songs start, hang around for a few minutes - with Ms Norah Jones making the sounds that she does, and then stop. Some of the instrumental playing is pleasant and I remember one guitar solo that wasn't bad. As for the voice of Ms Norah Jones, it is hard to find anything interesting about it. She has a very limited tessitura (probably less than an octave). Her vocal expression is so limited that it hard to say if any song she is singing is happy or sad. The disinterest she seems to exhibit in her own material seems to be the only palpable quality she can convey in a song. I wonder if she even listens to her own material?<br />No doubt, fans of her first album will rush out to buy this album. I wouldn't be surprised if many of them are disappointed. Compared to &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, her first album positively rocked!!! At best, &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; will put you to sleep; at  worst, it is a dull, irritating and pointless album made by one of the world's most over-rated pop stars. Let me tell you, I'd rather listen to ten hours of non-stop sitar music than &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;!<br />If you want a decent Country album, go out and buy an Emmylou Harris album or anything by Johnny Cash!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|'Persuasion' is one of the nicest movies I have ever seen. At the beginning, I was a little confused and dismayed when I saw the heroine - she didn't look like any movie star I'm really used to seeing- but at the end she was gorgeous. And the captain also, is played by a very attractive Mr. Hinds. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a nice, plain, no-gimmick love story... and to anyone who might need their faith renewed that it is never too late for true love:-)
0671027387|3.0|Ok, I've read The DaVinci Code, Angels and Demons, Digital Fortress and now Deception Point since Christmas. It is hard to put anything Dan Brown writes down. The short chapter schtick works well to keep you reading just one more chapter - sort of like trying to eat that one last pretzel stick.<br />Now, which one was it that has the child estranged from the parent and the god-like agency head that turns out to be the villain? Which one has the university professor tweed suit type Indiana Jones hero/heroine who makes brilliant deductions from arcane minutiae to save the day in the nanosecond of time? Which one has the hero bedding the heroine on the last page after a whirlwind 24 hour adventure that would leave mere mortals in an ICU bed rather than a connubial one? Which one has the technical errors that are fingernails on the chalkboard to those who really know something about the subject?<br />Reading these books is like eating spaghetti, fettucine and lasagna - lots of twists and turns but at the end of the day, all you've got a belly full of pasta.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|\\"Love,actually\\" could be described as a typical romantic comedy, like so many others that come out each year, only... it's not!!<BR>It's a mix,actually. A mix of a bunch of romantic stories that connect in one way or another. The stories cover a wide range of today's relationships and you're bound to see yourselves in some of them. There is the girl who is in love with a guy from office but she is too cowardly to reveal, the married guy who is in love with a  younger girl from work, the divoced writer who travels to a small village to write his new book and finds true love,Britain's Prime Minister who falls in love with a secretary, and many others.<BR>   It was a very moving film. I can't wait for the DVD. It goes without saying that I'm gonna be one of the first to buy the DVD.If you like \\"Notting Hill\\", \\"Bridget Jones's Diary\\" and \\"My Best Friends Wedding\\" you are sure to find this movie more than good. Awsome, actually!
B00009NHC5|5.0|Wow.  This movie is great.  The suspense is very well brought out.  The use of light and dark gives a tremendous sense of fear.  Audrey Hepburn was amazing.  She pulls you inside her character.  Mel Ferrer was great to deliver such a great film.  I was not born in time to see it in the theater. :(  Alan Arkin was superb.  It was interesting to see a real actor living his character.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|David Bowie's latest cd is a marvel. Full of strong songs with synthesizer sounds and effects bleeping in and out. He also sounds much younger on most of the tracks. The beauty of this cd isn't revealed fully the first time you hear it, but after a number of spins, you're hooked.<br />The cd opens with the Grammy nominated `New killer star' with a killer riff and chorus. `Pablo Picasso' has him singing in his familiar lower register, and has a beautiful guitar finale. `Never get old' is another marvel, with clunky beats and lush soaring backing vocals, especially about halfway through the song.<br />`The loneliest guy' is a mournful tune with David singing in a tremulous voice about solitude. `Looking for water' is a real rocker with a great chorus.<br />`Days' is a light, airy sing-along pop song. Very catchy, one of my favourites. The lyrics are also really good, revealing some vulnerability and sensitivity. `Reality is another rocker, chock full of industrial clangs, crashes and guitars racing at a frenetic pace.<br />The closing track is `Bring me the disco king', a 7 minute 45 second epic, with slight jazzy piano, and slow skittering drum beats. Very very good.<br />The bonus cd boasts 3 tracks, `Fly', `Queen of all the tarts', (which features more music than singing, the chorus made up of fantastic vocal layering) and `Rebel Rebel' which is a re-recording of his classic, more energetic, with a more defined guitar riff, and richer sound. Great!<br />The artwork on the digipak is great too, colourful and abstract, with 3 photos of a very youthful looking Bowie on the inside.<br />A very experimental, innovative, fresh and contemporary sounding cd from one of music's finest.
B00018D44U|5.0|When first listening to norah jones' 2nd album, the first thing that struck me is that it's very different from her first, the celebrated &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. Come away with me was bluesy and mellow in a pensive sort of way. &quot;Feels like home&quot; has a much more upbeat, and (generally) more fast-paced tunes. As other reviewers noted, it is strongly country-influenced. This is not to belittle it, just to it's nothing like her other music. In fact, after 3 or 4 listenings, I'm enormously satisfied, and increasingly confident in Jones' ability to continue producing stellar albums.<br />  The album opens with &quot;Sunrise&quot; which was released a little more than a month ago. This is one of the more catchy tunes, and I suppose it will be played on the radio a lot. It's definately a beauty, and is a kind of segue between her two albums.<br />Next is &quot;What am I to you&quot; which norah wrote herself. Again, this song will be another favorite with its enticing and powerful words and its awesome vocals.<br />&quot;Carnival Town&quot; is kind of creepy in its slow and sad tone. It creates the same depressing but beautiful ambience as in &quot;One Flight Down&quot; and &quot;I've got to see you again&quot;. This tune is one of the most emotional on the album, and, again, is reminiscent of her first album.<br /> &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot; (Townes Van Zandt)is also also a high point. It is a very folk oriented song and has the characteristic &quot;norah&quot; appeal<br />  My favorite song on the album is definitely &quot;The Long Way Home&quot;. I believe it ranks among norah's best vocal performances, and has an incredible quality to it that truly makes it stand out.<br /> Finally, I'd like to mention &quot;Don't Miss you at All&quot;. Norah sets her lyrics to Duke Ellington's music making an awesome jazzy blend. Definitely something different.<br />Since the album is rather new (came out today), I have listened to it only a few times. Although I only mentioned 5 songs in the review, I like every song on the album (although some more than others).<br />In conclusion, Norah really outdid herself with &quot;Feels like home&quot;. The music is nothing that can be described in words, so go out and buy yourself a copy (bestbuy offers it for only $10). When listening, don't expect a continuation of &quot;Come away with Me&quot;, and you'll find there's just as much to love as in the original.ed 5 songs in the review, I like every song on the album (although some more than others). <BR>In conclusion, Norah really outdid herself with &quot;Feels like home&quot;.

B00003CXA6|5.0|If you're a fan of Shaara's book &quot;The Killer Angels&quot; you'll love this movie, as it doesn't stray from the book.  If you're a Civil War history buff, you'll love this movie, as it portrays the situations, strategies, decisions and results of the most strategic 3-day battle on the North American continent accurately.  It gives credit where credit is due and lets the blame fall where it may to both the North and to the South. The fate of the Union is at stake. It portrays the generals and the soldiers as the real people, with feelings, dreams and hopes.  My girlfriend even liked this movie just for the story and the drama.  Excellent cast, beautiful scenery and the largest civil war recreation ever on film.
B000099T2L|5.0|Well I bought this cd when it first came out, and someone stole it from me, so i just HAD 2 buy another one. LOL. This album is ABSOLUTELY incredible! Her voice is amazing! From the start with &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; going through with &quot;Naughty Girl&quot; and sailing on through &quot;Signs&quot; and &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot;. This cd is awesome. I will advise it to anyone! The best songs on the album are &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;, &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, &quot;Be With You&quot;, &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot;, &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot; and my favorite of them all, &quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot;. This is an AMAZING album. One of my favorites! Go and get it!! Don't forget the songs with Outkast(&quot;Hip Hop Star&quot;)and the great duet, which they just won a Grammy for, &quot;The Closer I Get To You&quot;.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is told in the first person by a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult. The book's setting is a small town in Alabama, and the action behind Scout's tale is her father's determination, as a lawyer, liberal, and honest man, to defend a Negro accused of raping a white girl.  The most important theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is the book's exploration of the moral nature of human beings-that is, whether people are essentially good or essentially evil. The novel approaches this question by dramatizing Scout's and Jem's transition from a perspective of childhood innocence, in which they assume that people are good because they have never seen evil, to a more adult perspective, in which they have confronted evil and must incorporate it into their understanding of the world. As a result of this portrayal of the transition from innocence to experience, one of the book's important subthemes involves the threat that hatred, prejudice, and ignorance pose to the innocent: people such as Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are not prepared for the evil that they encounter, and, as a result, they are destroyed. Even Jem is victimized to an extent by his discovery of the evil of racism during and after the trial. Whereas Scout is able to maintain her basic faith in human nature despite Tom's conviction, Jem's faith in justice and in humanity is badly damaged, and he retreats into a state of disillusionment.<br /> The moral voice of To Kill a Mockingbird is Atticus Finch, who has experienced and understood evil without losing his faith in the human capacity for goodness. Atticus understands that, rather than being simply creatures of good or creatures of evil, most people have both good and bad qualities. The important thing is to appreciate the good qualities and understand the bad qualities by treating others with sympathy and trying to see life from their perspective. He tries to teach this ultimate moral lesson to Jem and Scout to show them that it is possible to live with conscience without losing hope or becoming cynical. In this way, Atticus is able to admire Mrs. Dubose's  courage even while deploring her racism. Scout's progress as a character in the novel is defined by her gradual development toward understanding Atticus's lessons. There is a maturity in Scouts observation as she finds contradiction in Mrs. Faust's intolerable racist manners towards blacks, but utmost compassion towards Jews massacre by Hitler.
0385504209|2.0|The casual reader will probably find the Da Vinci code spellbinding, mainly due to the bombastic nature of the conspiracy. The first page of the book  anointes the historical details underpinning the conspiracy  as matters of established \\"fact\\". The cardboard characterizations, pedantic action, self-effacing expository and flat prose of the book take a back seat as long as the reader is under the belief that Dan Brown is in the know and you are not, that he has researched what he is writing about, as any credible author would, and that the historical details enumerated are indeed \\"established facts\\".  As long as the reader is under the spell of the books factual imperviousness,  the conspiracy at the center of the book will be enough to beguile you into overlooking the books otherwise considerable shortcomings. So here is the rub - Dan Brown didn't do any real research for this book.  Zip. None. Zero.  The \\"facts\\" presented are so far from being historically accurate as to be ludicrous, reckless and downright duplicitous.  Brown goes out of his way to avoid facts so well established by both sides of the isle as to effectively pull a gigantic \\"gotcha\\" on the reader. The story is only interesting and engaging if you are under the belief it's based in historical facts, as Brown brazenly attempts to do. Take that away and it becomes simply a waste of time - a porous work of fiction lightly masking the authors puzzling agenda. Among the numerous and mind numbingly inaccurate details are his parallels of Mithrailism to Christian cornerstones like the resurrection,  when in fact Mithraic Scholars attest there is no Mithraic resurrection or  even death. He completely ignores the resurrection as the driving central belief of the early Christian church. He totally misstates Constantine's role in the Council of Nicea, ignoring the fact Constantine had no role whatsoever in the Canonization of the Bible. Brown can't even get simple details correct like the Dead Sea Scrolls. They were discovered in 1947, not the 50's and no Gospels were contained in the scrolls contrary to Browns \\"facts\\".  Readers who leave intact the veneer of \\"fact\\" the story needs to weave it's spell will most likely find the book engaging. Once the reader realizes the joke is on him, he or she will have difficulty finishing the book. The upside however, is the book may spurn readers to do their own research and teach them to be wary of demagogues cloaked in scholarship. In fact, Brown inspired me to think of a new word - fugenda: a fuge like state involving the blatant omission or revision of facts to satisfy a personal agenda.y were discovered in 1947, not the 50's and no Gospels were contained in the scrolls contrary to Browns \\"facts\\".

B000003TA4|5.0|Its easy to see why an Nirvana where pushed quickly into the lime light of the early 90's with this incredably &quot;different&quot; sound for the beginning of the last decade...<BR>This album makes you wonder exactly what was going on the band members minds while writing and recording this music. Track after track of delightful uniqueness all in a small naked baby covered Jewel Case...<BR>If you havent yet experienced Nirvana, then this will shake your usual music tastes, in an easy eye-opening way.
0553583182|4.0|My original copy has been read so many times that the front cover finally came off! While I don't agree with EVERYthing Mr. Murphy put in this book, I'm simply amazed that there is so much good stuff that can be used and practiced.<br />The techniques can be used in conjunction with just about any sort of Mind Science type of material from NLP to Huna to Quantum Physics to Silva Mind Control. A good companion volume would be Jess Stearn's _Alpha Thinking_ which is another variation on the Silva Mind Control method.

0783114222|5.0|I originally saw this when HBO aired it in late April to early May of 1998. I wasn't even born when these events actually happened, so to be able to see the accomplishments of the NASA space program is wonderful, not only for myself, but for the people who did see it when it happened. This documentary covers Alan Shepards' flight of Mercury 7, President Kennedys' speech that got the space program off the ground, up through Apollo 17 - sadly, Americas' last steps on the moon.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, and I was sad that it ended (we always want more when we're immersed in something we enjoy so much), but it took me a few days to realize why I liked it. It is slow moving, that's true, but that's part of the charm - it conjures up an ethereal atmosphere in both the way Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson interact with each other and how they interact with the huge bustling city that surrounds them. The movie also slips and veers away from any expectations you have about &quot;formula&quot; romance movies. It's a unique experience (and I mean that, it's an experience more than a story), and I wanted to rewatch the movie again just hours after I'd seen it. Another great thing about this movie is that it DOES have a nice rewatchable factor to it, so it's one of those DVDs that won't just stick on your shelf and never be seen again.
B00006879E|5.0|great music accompanied by a great stylish voice
B00005JKC3|3.0|I saw Hulk today. I went expecting to find a mindless summer action flick. Instead, I was taken aback by the dark, often extremely disturbing elements of it. I shouldn't be, since most of the elements showed up in the comic over th years, but I guess seeing it all on screen adds a certain emotional page that you just don't get on the four colored page. Some scenes caused me to squirm in my seat. Without elaborating, some things hit close to home. The origin story differs much from the story. In the movie, Bruce Banner's father is using his toddler son in illegal experiments hoping to build the perfect man. In actuality, his long term goal is to improve upon himself genetically. Without spoiling any more of the essential plot elements, Bruce's father is an all around abusive man who brutalizes both Bruce and his mother. Bruce represses memories of this abuse (one instance especially) but it comes out after the accident that exposes him to Gamma rays. The Gamma rays trigger his father's old experiments and turns Bruce into the Hulk. The Hulk is Bruce's id-a personification of his subconscious rage. <br />The only calming effect on the Hulk is Betty Ross, played by Jennifer Connelly. Connelly is pretty much playing the same character she played in A Beautiful Mind She won an Oscar for that role, and although he Academy Awards ignores movies like this, I think her role here is just as emotionally intense and deserves at least a nod. Mercy, they gave one to a thug like Eminem. Why not to a comic book movie? Sam Elliot plays General \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, Betty's estranged father (See a theme here?) who is obsessed with destroying the Hulk-until he sees how much Betty cares for Bruce. I love Sam Elliot for his westerns, but he makes just as good an old warhorse. It eminded me a lot of his character from We Were Soldiers If you liked him in that, you'll like him in this. The best role, though, was Nick Nolte as David Banner, Bruce's father. He played him so clinically psychotic and over the top, he was the most colorful actor. He chews up every scene he is in, especially near the end when he lays out his motivations for experimenting on Bruce. It is totally chilling that a person would do that to his own son, yet I believe he's capable of it because he's such a fruitcake.<br />The star is, of course, the Hulk. The CGI was fantastic-miles above Jar Jar Binks. My favorite scene is the battle with the tanks. There are several laugh out lius moments as he destroys them one at a time. The scene where the Hulk attacks San Francisco is also impressive.<br />I'll admit some things had me scratching my head. The mutated poodles, for one. Yes. Mutated poodles. The ending is also largely symbolic and open to interpretation. I'll have to chew it over before I pass judgment on it. Regardless, I think Hulk is definitely worth seeing, but it is certainly not a movie fit for kids like Spiderman was.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is one for the books.  College Dropout had me reminiscing on the good old days, and I literally grew up all over again.  The beats are like mellow, jazzed up, Fat Albert type joints, and the beats still go hard.  This one goes down with all of Outkast's albums, DMX's first CD, and the Clipse.....put it in the CD player and let it ride!
B000002WUD|5.0|Well, I put off the purchase of this set for a long, long time.  But after owning and loving the 50's and 60's sets for years I felt I needed to add the 70's set to my collection.  I even thought a few of the songs might be kind of good.  A few?  How about almost every song!!  There has been a lot of talk about the mature Elvis voice of the 1970's.  So true.  His voice was incredible during this period.  This box set shows Elvis the singer - of every type of music.  And I know what you are thinking - this guy is just another one of those Elvis nuts who worshipped the sideburns and jumpsuits.  Forget the image.  Forget Vegas.  Forget that TV movie they always show on VH1. This box set suggests something entirely different than the Elvis Presley who was the friend of donut makers and pharmacies everywhere.  This box set suggests a man who was confidently singing great songs until he passed.  And the evidence is overwelming that there was more to this man than met the eye.  105 songs!!  This guy was working overtime.  Sure there are other recordings that were weak and did not make this set but 105 great performances. Do yourself a favor.  Buy this box set.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|I went to see Underworld with the greatest excitement in the world. Although I was forewarned a bit when I read the novelization of the book that it might not be that great. I hoped it would translate better on screen. <br />It did not. It sucked! No pun intended...<br /> The writing was weak, the dialouge so chessy that in some parts was laughable. The acting was medicore, especially in the part of the vampire Kraven (Shane Brolly). I guess like anyone can be a singer nowadays, anyone can also be an actor. The cinemetography was below par. There were times when I didn't know what I was seeing. Underworld's aim as an action/romance movie didn't hit on target. The movie dragged on too much in my opinion that I was wondering when it will be over. <br /> I enjoyed the character of Selene and Kate Beckinsale's performance. My favorite character was Lucian, which frankly was the best thing out of the whole movie. I loved Michael Sheen's performance. It's a shame that the character was axed off. <br /> Just because you doing an action movie doesn't mean it doesn't have to be good. If your going to do it, do it right. <br />Underworld did Not do it right.<br />I give it a C+
B0000C0FJB|4.0|I have been listening to Rush now for over 20+ years. And, as any devoted Rush fan, just about every piece of material they have ever put out, spent tons of $$$ on seeing them in multiple concerts, etc. etc. etc.<br />With that said, I missed the Vapor Trails tour in Houston, but when I discovered this release I bought both the CD and DVD.<br />Yes, the sound quality is not the best and certainly, Different Stages &quot;sounds&quot; better in different ways. But, I would disagree with some of the reviews listed here that suggest this is a one star performance.<br />Live albums are just that live albums. I will admit that the crowd noise at times is alittle overpowering, but overall, this live album is fantastic. With the revised drum solo, ending in the borrowed piece from Neil's work on the Buddy Rich tribute albums, to the jazz interlude on La Villa Strangiato, this is Rush through and through with all the extras.<br />For a true admirer of all their work, temper your disappoint over the sound quality. I would laugh to think if we had reviews of people talking about Exit Stage Left when I had bought it on an ALBUM!<br />Rush is reaching the end of a journey that I am sure they are all at some point looking to complete. I hope the North American tour may lead to at least one or two more studio albums, but with that said if this is their last live album, I, along with anyone else who as listened to Rush all these years greatly appreciate the release of this piece of work.<br />Awesome performance!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah is great. Afterglow hangs right in with her other works. I really think this truely Sarah. I would recomment Sarah to everyone, Afterglow is right at the top.<br />Thanks Sarah, you never disappoint me
B00005KARK|5.0|If you've read some of the reviews bellow, you'll notice a lot of defending of this film going on.  Yea, a member of the PC police wrote a review saying they'd ban there kid from watching this cruel, insensitive, irresponsible cartoon.  Here's a list of why this film is a great opportunity to entertain AND educate your kids;<br /><br />EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES<br />-You can use this film to discuss how cruel teasing can affect others.  The teasers are THE BAD GUYS!!<br />-Point out how hurtful behaving in an exclusive manner can be.<br />-Discuss how \\"Dumbo\\" perseveres despite the opinions of others.<br />-IF they ask, point out how bad things CAN happen when you use drugs or alcohol.<br />-Talk about how cultural sensitivities have changed since the 1940s. (The crows stereotyped as \\"blacks\\" are actually pretty shameful.  I don't point this out because my kids don't get it.)<br /><br />ENTERTAIN<br />-extremely pure and simple story.  Kids love this film.<br />-\\"Casey Junior\\" song stick in your brain.  My 20 month old is enthralled by the train.<br />-\\"Elephants on Parade\\" is a real \\"Trip\\".  It is more remarkable when you consider the lack of computer technology at the time.<br />-The faceless \\"roust-abouts\\" are a little creepy, but my kids survived.<br />-The ending is as sugar-coated as you would ever want, which is why people love this film.<br /><br />DVD<br />-Totally re-mastered.  Flawless.<br />-2 shorts related to flying and elephants are ok.<br />-Black and White Sound stage clip from \\"The Reluctant Dragon\\" is pretty cool.<br />-Enough extras for a couple of hours.<br /><br />I think the main take-away from this review is that;<br />-you can choose to protect your kids from everything<br /> or<br />-you can teach them how to cope with salutations that they will inevitably encounter.<br /><br />I certainly would not ban my kids from seeing an imaginative art piece like \\"Dumbo\\".  In the famous words of Dori in \\"Finding Nemo\\"...  \\"If you don't let anything happen to him, then nothing will happen to him.  Not much fun for little Elmo\\".
B00005ASHM|5.0|Wow!  Just wow!   What an amazing, amazing, piece of music!  I love the Beach Boys.  They rock forever.   Pet Sounds is great and beautiful and amazing.  I love this album!  I listen to it all the time!   Head on my shoulder and God only knows makes me cry.  And I just wasn't made for these times, either.  BB, you rock my world!  Thanks so much for this beautiful, beautiful album!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The best sondtrack of the year,especially to Howard Shore.He makes a perfect song into the this film.
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Underworld had potential, and perhaps that's why I'm disappointed. Vampire vs. Werewolf; its actually quite simple and they screwed it up. The writers apparently thought that Werewolves needed a nerdy name, Lycans and Vampires needed redeemable qualities; they don't eat humans. The point of all this resides in one bad vampire king. I think it would have been much more interesting if neither the Vampires or Werewolfs would have had redeemable qualities. Making monsters act human for the sake drudging along an unoriginal love story with no payoff is just stupid. The only reason I gave it Two Stars is the background scenery, costuming, and some of the special effects.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I could never see the LOTR Extended Versions.When i see this movie,is a longer film than the other
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the best Britney cd yet... every single song is incredible ! So she doesn't have a voice like Mariah Carey or even Xtina... but Britney's music is so catchy and fun... &lt;333 Love it 5 stars easy ! * * * * *
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD was WAYYYY better than I expected. And people who don't like it and/or don't have it should get it. I'm also amazed that on Amazon.com the sales rank is 5.....at least so far. And before it was 11! Not that that's good or anything.<br />1. Going Under: A-: I like the video and the song, but it's not my favorite.<BR>2. Bring Me To Life: A+: I loove it! What I also like about it is Paul McCoy. He fits great!<BR>3. Everybody's Fool: A: Good beat, good words, good song.<BR>4. My Immortal: A+: One of my faves! I loove it when the band kicks in (even though that's in the hidden track band version, track 12)!<BR>5. Haunted: A: The song looks short by the lyrics in the sleeve but it's longer-and better-than I thought it would be!<BR>6. Tourniquet: A: Look at the description for it on #3.<BR>7. Imaginary: A++: MY FAVORITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>8. Taking Over Me: A: Look at the description for it on #3.<BR>9. Hello: A: Look at the description for it on #3.<BR>10. My Last Breath: A+: Love it!!!<BR>11. Whisper: A+: Look at the description for it on #10.<BR>12. My Immortal (Band Version) (Hidden Track): A+: Look at the description for it on #4.<br />I LOOVE this band!!!! YOU SHOULD GET THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0001AP158|5.0|This is an awesome DVD a must have for every Bon Jovi fan......I love Bon Jovi and was definately not disappointed with this Dvd......I recommend any Jovi fan to get it........
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am one not one to normally write reviews - nor for that matter obsess about the lives of characters on the screen.  Though Firefly creatively brings together all the pieces to create a stunning masterpiece.  I think it offers a little something for everyone from humor, sarcasm, Chinese swear words, relationships, drama, mystery, intrigue and action.  This box set shares the place as the #1 title in my DVD collection of over 450 - - my recommendation to you is to give it a try to see where it will sit.  I guarantee you for under $40 you will not at all be disappointed.  <br />PS- all my support for the movie in 2004!!!!!!!  Fingers Crossed, Prayers Said!
B000002UAO|5.0|And I think this is one of the greatest albums of all time!
B00005JMCN|5.0|Seabiscuit was an under-advertised movie that surprised me in how good it was.  It starts off slow telling a lot of  backstory, and the main character doesn't appear nearly soon enough, but if you overlook those problems it's a wonderful and literally beautiful film.  I loved the horse and wished we could have seen more of it and even more races.  The races were breathtaking.  Yes, it's a feel-good movie but a deep one, not superficial, and a genuinely good story.<br />I don't know why, but I rented this DVD and watched it four times and then could barely part with it, so I ended up buying it.  The horse and characters are endearing.  The races, even if you aren't into horse racing, are filmed so great you feel you are in them, riding in them or close by in the stands.  The stars of this ensemble cast were perfectly cast and did a fine job.  Tobey Maguire was nearly unrecognizable as a skinny little red-haired jockey, but he did a terrific job.  Jeff Bridges and Chris Cooper were fantastic as well and perfect for their parts. This DVD also comes with some great extra features.  I'd say buy it now,-  you won't regret it a bit.  It's a movie that will stay in your heart a long time, and will be thought of years later as one of the best of 2003.
B000002UAR|5.0|Little wonder it just topped yet another &quot;best ever poll&quot; as the greatest album of all time!
B000063UR2|4.0|Even with a semi-disappointing performance by Tom Cruise, it wasn't a bad movie. Tim Curry gives a strong performance as the Satan-esque character.<br />Now the thing that really bugs me: everyone comparing every single fantasy film to Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Don't get me wrong, I love those movies and the books for that matter, but you can't compare everything to those movies. For one thing, this movie came out in the mid 80's, and as we all know special effects weren't nearly as developed then as they are now. Not only that, but fantasy was a new type of movie back then, Legend being one of the first fantasy movies that wasn't animated, such as the Lord of the Rings which came out in the 70's. All I'm saying is evaluate each movie as something independant from a different movie, most notably Lord of the Rings. Again, Lord of the Rings is one of my favorite movies, but give it a rest.
B000002C1V|2.0|Hello<BR>This is not what i expected. Not Now John is a clasic. The rest of the tracks are just OK.
B00005JMCN|1.0|Sea Biscut:<BR>Main Entry: sea biscuit<BR>Function: noun<BR>: HARDTACK 1<BR>According to A certain dictionary.<br />Seabiscuit is very overrated. Not just a reatarded name, wow, a piece of maggoty bread races in Tijuana, who cares if a horse won a race in Mexico? Even if people do, there are simply too many plots and are not potrayed well. I was expecting Oscar Material but it came out of the stables as lame as a hamstrung horse.
B000002A3T|5.0|What can i say, this album has it all. You must feel this album. David Gilmour is an excellent singer. Guitars are exceptionally great.The music of this album is immortal. Listening to this album makes you feel in Heaven.
B000000OQF|4.0|The amalgamation of pop sensibilities, hard rock, glam rock and punk nihilism gave birth to Guns N' Roses. This band was not so much about music as it was about image and ego, which eventually led to its downfall. But one would be hard pressed to write them off as \\"just another 80's rock band\\" because these guys played a minor but important role in killing off the mushy, sappy hair metal bands that ruled the roost those days (a task performed to perfection by the likes of Nirvana and Pearl Jam). Their debut \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" sent shock waves across America and around the world when it was released in 1987. The \\"four letter word\\" was used so extensively in any album for the first time and everyone followed suit (give them some credit for that or should we, 'coz it set the precedence for every Tom, Dick and Harry to fill up their songs with the \\"four letter word\\" and suddenly the presence of the \\"four letter word\\" in a song became a synonym for \\"Cool\\"). The album tried to capture the anger and frustration of youth trying to make it on their own in the wide wicked world (\\"Welcome To The Jungle\\", \\"Outta Get Me\\")...Aaah! Then there was Sex (\\"Anything Goes\\"), Booze (\\"Nighttrain\\"), Drugs (\\"Mr. Brownstone\\") and Rock N' Roll. It was not that Guns N' Roses were allergic to love songs. \\"Think About You\\" and \\"Sweet Child OF Mine\\" are rocking ballads; the latter, a #1 hit; thx to the catchy intro by lead guitarist, Slash . The album closes out with \\"Rocket Queen\\", a sexy rocker featuring a raunchy, blues tinged lead guitar and some moaning (Courtesy: Axl) until the song breaks down in the middle, takes a 180-degree turn and changes into a ballad. But the clear winner here is \\"Paradise City\\", a rollicking anthem of a song, the band members virtually jamming and having a blast. The band later went on to do a few more albums but none could top this one. Whatever you think of Guns N' Roses, this album surely has a place in the Rock N' Roll pantheon. 17 years after it's release, this furiously stellar album still sounds like a serious troublemaker.
B000001Y42|1.0|It's amazing, I have no idea what sinister god of bad music possesed me. Then again my older sister worshipped hair metal bands like Poison and Ratt when she was a teen before realizing how horrible they where. I guess I was just young, naieve and just getting into music as a whole. I loved Korn and Limp Bizkit like they where the Stones and Beatles. And then I saw what a complete ego maniac Fat Freddy turned out to be, he is(or was)by far the most arrogant person in the music industry and clearly exposed the nu metal/rapcore scene as a joke. Dumb frat boy shouts, rantings against some mysterious ex-girlfriend who probably had a good reason to leave his fat highness and pathetic nasal singing are all Fred is good at. And the music? Dull, at best. I hear how Wes is often considered to be a great guitarist but I just don't see it. The man clearly has talent but I think he gets his acclaim more for his artsy music tastes and stage makeup then for real guitar showmanship and creativity. Seems his &quot;amazing&quot; band Eat the Day won't see the light of day either. I can't deny that Jon Otto and Sam Rivers are a good rhythym section but they honestly make laughable &quot;jump up and then bend over up and down a lot&quot; sounds that make nu metal so distinctive.<BR>So after some time of branching on to other music I gave this cd a spin and concluded that I had no idea what good music was back then. I'm even embarrassed to admit a 5 star review of this album written by me lurks somewhere on this page. Nu metal is dying, and Limp Bizkit clearly illustrates this. Their new album is sinking faster than a fat woman in a cotton suit and they will be dead before 2005 rolls around. If you want a good combination of metal, hip hop and hardcore then check out Orange 9mm., Candiria, Downset and the mighty and sadly departed RATM. Most of the bands began long before da Bizkit. Keep exploring new music.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie was boring, almost beyond belief.  The woman I saw it with kept nodding off, and when we left the theater she asked, &quot;Did we go to the right movie?  Was that the movie all of the critics were raving about?&quot; She had it right, even though she snoozed through about a quarter of the film.<BR>Murray almost saves it with about ten minutes to go, by putting in a strong final show of his innate acting ability. The problem is though that the movie is so painfully slow up to that point, that it cannot be saved, ultimately.  I would pass this one by.
0385510438|5.0|I loved this book, along with all of Mr. Grisham's books!  While it's a social commentary on small-town life in the South, it's really much more.  It's a wonderful stream of character studies that all mesh to form the fabric for this excellent book.  The story isn't complicated but it is interesting enough to keep your attention.  Also recently read \\"Odd Thomas,\\" \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and \\"Bark of the Dogwood.\\"
B00005YW4H|5.0|I have to say that this slow jazz/r&amp;b/western/whatever genre is what I would never listen to. I'm more of a rap &amp; rock listener. But this album is regularly in my cd player nowadays. Norah Jones' voice just puts me in a calm trance with her raspy yet sensual voice. She doesn't have an overly impressive range like Alicia Keys or Christina Aguliera, but its perfect for the rendition of songs she performs on this album. My favorites have to be &quot;Don't Know Why&quot;, &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot;, and the cover song &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;. I think everyone should try listening to Norah Jones. Its already a guilty pleasure of mine.:)
B0000C8AVI|5.0|Although the word &quot;hip&quot; has never been in my vocabulary, &quot;hip&quot; is certainly not the way one could have described an album of Christian rock songs released in 1979, a time when popular music was dominated by New Wave and the decadance of disco. Bob Dylan wasn't concerned with such labels, one reason why he was (and remains) hipper than everybody. The critics be damned (in more ways than one, I suppose), Dylan was a man with a message who wasn't going to dilute it to curry favor with anyone.<br />And thank God for that because &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; is a great, powerful album. Some critics, professional and amateur alike, dismiss these songs on the grounds that they're arrogant, but those same critics did not seem to mind Dylan's self-described &quot;finger pointin'&quot; when the message was secular. The fire and brimstone mentality might have been grating if not for the fact that, musically, Dylan is operating at full power, and, lyrically, he is obviously very sincere in his beliefs.<br />Whether sympathetic to the message or not, it's hard to believe anyone could not be moved by &quot;I Believe In You&quot; and &quot;Precious Angel,&quot; delighted by &quot;Man Gave Names to All the Animals,&quot; and overpowered by the dynamic &quot;When He Returns.&quot; This album is right up there with his best work, and the follow-up, &quot;Saved,&quot; is its equal, and may, in some ways, be even better.<br />Produced by Jerry Wexler and Barry Beckett, this album is the most polished of any Dylan album. Mark Knopfler's fluid guitar licks add to the sonic delight of this first class effort.
6303165680|5.0|I frequently watch Four Weddings because it's a marvelously funny and classy movie. Several years ago I would never have believed that Hugh Grant could be a serious actor, but now I regard him as an excellent comedic actor, something like Cary Grant. His persona is similar to Cary Grant's: the handsome, appealing, but socially bungling playboy never-do-well. I love this persona, and I'm reminded of Cary Grant's movies with Irene Dunne.They are so hilarious because Dunne has a razor sharp wit and can put Grant in his place with her retorts.<br /><br />The cast of actors in Foour Weddngs is interesting because you have the upper class,the middle class, the intellectual, and the lower class represented. They don't mind mingling with each other, and they genuinely love one another. Hugh's lines are always funny, especially at the first reception. Another great moment of comedy is at the reception of Bernard's wedding when Hugh Grant is seated with old flames, and his indiscretions are brought up at the table by these former flames.<br /><br />Four Weddings is very balanced because there is a thread of sadness about the oneliness of the characters' not being married coarsing through the film, especially Hugh's character.Also, the death of the ebullient Garret, provides a wonderful foil to what might have become a silly film. Kristen's character is also sad because she never finds her love because she loves Hugh Grant's character. I wish that they would have fallen in love, instead of Andie McDowell's character.<br /><br />The film's music score is gorgeous, also. Richard Rodney Bennett composed the music to Yanks, with Richard Gere and Lisa Eichorn. William Devane, and Vanessa Redgrave. Yanks is a great romantic movie.I highly recommend it, even if you don't think Gere a good actor.<br /><br />I frequently watch Four Weddings, and I heartily recommend it those who haven't viewed it or to those who need a romantic facelift.<br /><br />Ricky Wallace
B00004W221|1.0|A gifted athelete that overcame the odds? No. A stellar career in college sports? No. An enormous desire to have a Notre Dame education? No. Rudy had an unhealthly obsession with ND football. He was not good enough to play for them. He merely wouldn't go away and so he pestered his way into a couple of plays (if that). Mind you he should be proud that he got an education at a fine university like ND but that isn't why he went there. If you want a good ND film try Knute Rockne All American. Do you want an inspirational sports story, try Brian's Song, The Pride of the Yankees or Hoosiers. These are the stories of athletes that gave it all for their team. Rudy had nothing to give so he asked the team to give it to him. Sorry, I tried to watch the movie without getting depressed but Rudy's just too pathetic.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Thank God for Kanye West. He just saved hip hop. Everyone should run out and get a copy before they're all gone. This might be the best CD of 2004.

B00013RC8O|5.0|It Is All Time Best Movie Of All Times..This Movie Is For All The Mopar Fans...Some Chevy Guys Don't Like But That OK!!!! All Around The Best Car Movie Of All Times....
B0000C9V3T|5.0|I spent about 3 hours downloading the soundtrack from Kazaa, since I would never be crazy enoug to spend $10 on an album, and I must say this SOUNDTRACK IS LITTERED WITH COOLNESS.<br />The best tracks in my opinion in order are:<BR>Green hornet<BR>Battle without Honor or humanity<BR>and last but not least the Japanese vocal songs. <br />My only complaint is that the major songs aren't long enough, not long as the Japanese ones. Since I don't speak Japanese they don't mean much to me. Too bad there was no translation.<br />I cant imagine driving in my SUV listening to this stuff or blasting it from my sound system so I think it is a more enjoyable soundtrack with a DVD instead of CD becauseI'd rather watch the action.<br />Still this is a GROOVY soundtrack that is as cool as the movie itself. Which reminds me, I'm still waiting for volume 2
B0000TB01Y|5.0|this cast recording is amazing. it is definitely the best out right now. you know the story without even seeing the show. It is funny, entertaining, and extremely well written.

B00018D44U|4.0|Yesterday I listen 3 times to the new cd.<BR>It was very good...but the suprise is a bit gone.<BR>Also is is a little bit more country than jazz.<BR>But very good en enjoyfull to listen.
B000068PQ0|4.0|i remember when me, the person i am seeing, his friend brett, and a mutual friend went out to eat at a chinsese resturaunt. that night brett, wanted to go to tower to get the new flaming lips cd. we did but they didn't have it. so instead we went to borders. he picked up the cd. the artwork looked so cool and i was in the mood for some new music so i asked if i could copy it. i did and i liked it. i wasn't blown away by it but i liked it. for awhile i kept debating if i should go ahead and buy my own copy. well i never did. then a little over a year later i went with some friends, including brett, to see them perform live. i wasn't all that blown away. too much was happening on stage. well now it is 2004 and i decided to go ahead and buy my own copy. i hardly listen to the one i have but i like it. having heard do you realize on the car commercial made see what a great song it is. i also heard the line &quot; do you realize that you have the most beautiful face&quot; and was blown away because i know someone i love that i could sing that to. now this cd is not the best cd ever but it does have very good songs on it. i like fight test, yoshimi battles the pink robots pt. 1, ego tripping at the gates of hell, it's summertime, and of course do you realize. this isn't as rocking as the soft bulletin but it is still a great cd. those meomories of that night that my friend picked up this cd upon release i will always keep with me. and this cd just stirs them like a twister stirring up trailer parks.
B0000CAXIC|4.0|I may be an over-50 geezer but from time to time I like to pop this one in and hear some serious in-your-face rock and roll.  So many modern bands these days just dip their toes into the rock waters but these guys jump in with both feet and submerge themselves in its power.  I love a good screamer and Dave's one of the best (along with Roger Daltrey and Tom Petty from the old days).  &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot; just flat tears it up right and &quot;Everlong&quot; is one great song.  This cd's just perfect when driving home from a hard day at work and you just want to vent.
B00006V9A0|1.0|this cd i would recommend to the nirvana fan that wants to get into there music! i think this cd should have included alot more songs from the bleach album like &quot;love buzz, school, big cheese,&quot; but its just the hits its what the radio played as far as the unplugged tracks included in this cd are ok but they should have added other nirvana B-sides like the song &quot;sappy&quot; or marigold its just not what a real nirvana fan expects from a &quot;so called greatest hits album&quot; especially if it was under the coordination of courtney love its crap!!!
B000067CPX|5.0|By The Way is one of the best rock albums I have ever heard. Up there with the poilice's best and U2 War and many others.  The old peppers' music had one or two ballads that were great and a bunch of unlistenable noise. BTW is good from start to finish and has classics that aren't even charting like everyone. I love it and so will many old and new fans.

B0001AP12G|5.0|Other than Outkast and Jay-Z, this has been the only &quot;Real&quot; hip hop album that i've heard in the past couple years.  &quot;Jesus Walks,&quot; explains how Kayne doesn't care if he was ever recognized because of his beliefs.  He stays true to everything he believes in, he doesnt forget where he came from, and he doesnt brag about anything that he has among a few things. I've only reviewed the album one time through, and my favorite is &quot;Never let me down&quot; with Jay-Z.  Theres really no beafs thrown out except for some funny jokes about TRL in &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot;, which is a joke of a show anyway.  Just give the man his props.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Around about the time that music was starting to get downright bizarre with groups like the Mothers of Invention stirring things up these guys came out of left field with their country-folk-rock slant and threw a curve into my little head.  Every song was totally different in feel and intent.  You can tell they weren't really studio rats yet because the tracks are uneven in tempo and arrangement/production from time to time but that didn't dampen their enthusiasm or imagination.  Neil Young really stands out on this collection because he was blazing his own trail, not just following Stills and Furay down the path.  But these songs are very special to those who grew up listening to this band and, as best-of cds go, this one represents them quite well.
B000003TA4|5.0|I think this album is one of the best because you can listen to the whole album through and would want more &quot;polly something in the way territorial pissings and on a plain lounge act&quot; are my favorite tracks that ithink just stood out the whole album is great its self includeing smells like teen spirit but its so over rated now i usually skip the track because im a nirvana fan not a fan of smells like teen spirit i like nirvanas music in general! but the point here is that if your a nirvana fan and dont own this actual cd then u should slap your self in the face because your bad!!! any ways im sure you wont be disappointed at all
B00005JMGL|5.0|Now this is a great film version of Peter Pan. I was dazzled when I saw it the first time so much so that I had to see it again. I loved it even more. <br />What's so amazing about this film is the fact that Peter Pan is not a flat character. He's not quite so blah as he is in other film versions where Peter is simply a mischievious boy and that's that. <br />We learn that there is a sad side to Peter's life, if you can even call it a life. Inside Peter, lurks a young adult just aching to get out. The plot follows Barrie's amazing tale much closer than any other version on film. What's also refreshing about this Peter Pan is that it is not a musical. Personally, I feel that the singing detracts from the story by making it more lighthearted and carefree than what Barrie intended with his marvelous story. Don't get me wrong, Peter is a fancy free boy, but he's also trapped in world that is neverending.<br />Jeremy Sumpter is not only adorable (and definitely a boy who will grow into a very goodlooking man) but he portrays Peter with innocence, fun, and a touch of sadness. It's also nice that this Peter was actually played by a male. It creeps me out to see Wendy fawning over a female Peter (like Mary Martin). Jason Isaacs is in yet another noteable performance. Children will certianly know him from the Harry Potter series. Staying with the theater tradition, Isaacs plays both Captain Hook and Mr. Darling. His Captain Hook was more convincing than any other Captain Hook I've ever seen. We also learn about Hook's underlying sadness, and audiences will no doubt actually feel bad for the guy.<br />Bottom line-- Great film. Buy it, rent it, see it. Get the book. Get the poster. Cherish this story forever.
B0001AP158|5.0|from someone who was there and spent $1,000 for 1 ticket, it was worth every penny and so is this dvd.  must have for any true bon jovi fan...
B0000VCZK2|3.0|First off, it is good to have all this material together in one place and many theses, dissertations, and books on the series will probably be written in short order. Everyone else has already covered the issue of the innane title, so I'll skip that and go right to the real issue: much of the material with the DVDs is just as innane and often innacurate, such as the fact that several of the character names are mixed up in the Alien3 booklet (Holt McCallany plays Junior and not Christopher John Fields) now forever confusing an issue many of us have been trying for yeras to straighten out. This sort of slap-dash glitz with no real searious research (or proofreading) is inexcusable and has the potential to really ruin a valuable tool for film and SF researchers. I suppose I'll spend the next few years comparing the DVD collection to all the material I already have (which is most of it) and waiting nervously for the next mistake, and the next one, and the next . . .
B00004X0Q0|5.0|I cant even describe the feeling I get while listening to this cd. you cant even put At The Drive-In into a specific genre. there are not even any filler tracks on this album, you can sit back and enjoy all of it.<br />1. arcarsenal-wow, talk about a great opening track, i love all of the guitar work in this song. even tho i dont understand the lyrics to much, i sitll love it, one of the best on the album. 9/10<br />2. pattern against user- another great track, i love the chorus on this on, and the intro. 7.5/10<br />3. on armed sissor-surpirsingly, even tho it was their first single, its not one of the better songs on here, still good nonethenless. 8/10<br />4. sleepwalk capsules- dang, one of my favorite on the whole album, just all around great, very catchy. 8/10<br />5. invalid litter dept.- my 2nd favorite track on the album, the chorus is probably one of the best ive ever heard in any song. 10/10<br />6. mannequin republic- my least favorite song on here, if there is such a word as fillers, this is one, just not very good at all. 5/10<br />7. enfilade- atdi redeems themselves with this great song. this is my 3rd fav. on here. i love the chorus and all the instrumentals in this song. 9.5/10<br />8. rolodex propaganda-this song has a very weird intro, which would turn off most listeners, but once you get past weird intro, the song is truely a work of art. 8.5/10<br />9. quarantined- this is it, best track on the cd. one of the best songs ever in my opinion. everything about this song is great. the chorus, the lyrics, the guitars. and i love the little bass solo intro with the thunder and lightning. 11/10<br />10. cosmonaut- another great song, with big shoes to fill right after quarantined, but holds its own. 8/10<br />11. non-zero possiblity- very weird song, kinda errie, im glad they made a song like this. its a great ending track.8/10<br />well everyone go out and get At The Drive-In's relationship of command, one of best cd's, and pick up their other two cd's as well.
B0000035E7|5.0|this is the best nirvana album i can recommend why? well because its the raw sound of the guitar and the amazing vocals of kurt cobain that makethis whole album awsome alot of people say nevermind was the greates nirvana album i would say wrong if you want raw sounding grunge garage sound buy this album its just awsome from the first track to the very last it is what was before nevermind in other word its what inspired nevermind! you wont be disapointed this is a great album id day better than nevemind!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I just found out that all of the originals will be coming out on September 21,2004 in a 4 disc set.<BR>They will be the special editions only,per lucas's request...<BR>I think the special editions are the best versions of the films,so I love the fact that George Lucas feels the same way.<BR>Thank You Mr. Lucas<BR>I just wish he would put the dvd's in a replica of the death star,with enough slots to put the dvd's for episode 1,2,& 3<BR>and a poster,and anything else he could think of to put in with it.I would pay whatever price they want for something like that.<BR>I think that would kick ass.......<BR>May the force be with you
B00018D44U|5.0|In Japan, where I spent some time studying and doing movie work, Norah Jones is known as Tiny Wonder&quot;.  Indeed she lives up to this epitaph on her new cd, which I would ahve called  &quot;I Know Myself&quot;.  A lot of people dont like Tiny Wonder because she is jazz and not pop like britany or christina.  JAzz music is more instrumental and soulfoul.  But if you have an open mind then you will like this new outing from Tiny Wonder!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I laughed, I cried, it moved me!  It had everything.  The cast is utterly incredible and you really live their situations it so well done!  Many of my all time favorites doesn't hurt.  Colin Firth, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, the list goes on and on.  It breaks your heart, but also fills it up with love!
B000069AUI|5.0|I listened to Parachutes non-stop fro about a year. Nothing else came close to being anywhere near as good. Until I discovered Radiohead, and this album came out. My favourite track is... it would be quicker to list the tracks I don't give 10/10. Ok, God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, Daylight, A Whisper. I love those three, I just don't love them as much as the other ones. If I had to choose a favourite, I would say... &quot;The Scientist&quot;. This album blew me away, and I love it the best out of all other albums. I can't wait until album 3! In a word : AMAZING!
076781326X|5.0|Great movie, but is there a soundtrack?  I can not find one.
B00005JM02|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  The animation is unbelievable, the story line is great, and it is very funny!  I would recommend this to people of all ages!  Five Stars!
B00005JMCW|1.0|I'm not watching this movie because I resent Jamie Lee Curtis calling our President a warmonger. Keep your political opinions to yourself, Jamie -- your job is acting.
B0000508U6|5.0|How can people give this 3 stars? It really deserves 5. I love it so much, whenever I feel sad, angry, or stressed I can play Parachutes and feel good again. I bought it for my dad, when I heard him talking about it with my cousin, and decided to listen to it. The first time I heard yellow, I was sitting on my living room floor, and it was so beautiful I cried. I know thats a little pathetic, but it made me feel so happy. It still is my favourite song ever, and I was a devoted Coldplay worshipper ever since. Needless to say I &quot;adopted&quot; the album.
0385504209|2.0|...clearly designed to sell to the loads of suckers for whom WC Fields felt were not entitled to an even break. So, when art and history scholars complain about blatant misrepresentations of facts, Brown's defenders rebut with the perfect marketing spin: all the controversy is on account of Christians being offended because the tenets of their faith are shaken to the core and that, clearly the Church does want to suppress the \\"secret\\" marriage and progeny of Jesus and Mary Magdalegne, squelch the \\"divine feminine,\\" etc. If, after reading this book, one feels that Brown has provided him a swell education along with a great story, he is among the many who are, in my opinion, said (allegedly by PT Barnum, but actually by David Hannum in connection with a genuine conspiracy) to have been &quot;born every minute.&quot; On the other hand, if Brown's claims actually inspire the reader to do some fact checking and genuine learning, then Brown will have indeed rendered good service. Also rendering good service are those who advise the prospective reader to borrow instead of buy the book. If you should decide to read this, and, having begun, find yourself solving codes, riddles, mysteries, etc. before the brilliant Harvard symbologist does, and that your BS meter pegs out frequently, then don't imagine that the book will get better. It won't. (Lest you be confused by the \\"facts,\\" there aren't any that are both actually true and never revealed before.)  On the other hand, if you think you're being \\"edutained\\" by Brown, then you should find no end of other interesting material starting with the gnostic gospels themselves through loads of other stuff that continues to be produced \\"every minute.\\"
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is without question a complete package.  She is as vocally talented as she is beautiful and a gifted dancer.  Her performances are flawless and she owns the stage and the audience is at her mercy every minute as she graces the stage.  I have not seen another artist who is naturally as gifted an entertainer.  She has raised the bar and I know other male and especially female performers are wondering what they can do to compare. To be honest, her Grammy 2004 performance of Dangerously In Love, was absolutely flawless, it was so dramatic that it had the essense of a mini opera. Time actually stopped for the 10 minutes she was on stage and the audience was estatic, as I was. I have replayed that performance a countless number of times.  Her body, stature, so poised, it was absolutely breathtaking, lady-like passion.  That was womanhood in every sense of the word.  You can just tell from her demeanor that she instinctly owns up to every bit of the hype without trying to emulate other artist style.  Live not memorex.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|The Strokes present a problem. Their first album &quot;Is This It?&quot; was a good, catchy rock album, but it garnered more praise than it deserved. I don't think the band was ready for it. Thus their sophomore effort &quot;Room on Fire&quot; shows signs that Julian &amp; co. may be trying too hard. The album has several excellent tracks, but at times it gets bogged down by what appears to be unrealistic expectations for what is still a very young band. I don't think it is fair to compare them to The White Stripes because they lack the experience that the Stripes have. Jack and Meg had more time to prepare for stardom than The Strokes have, and it shows.<BR>&quot;Room on Fire&quot; moves like a pendulum from brilliance to mediocrity. It is as unstable as the atmosphere in spring, but it does have a theme. Ironically, that theme is part of what is holding it back. Julian's lyrics betray his feelings of frustration with what is expected from his band. This is not an indictment, because frankly I can't blame him. On &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot; it sounds like he is lamenting a break-up with a woman, but it also sounds like he wants to disappear from the public. On &quot;Reptilia&quot; he claims to be &quot;going too fast&quot;, which may allude to what I've written earlier about the bands rapid rise. &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; repeats that theme, and that repetition is a problem.<BR>&quot;12:51&quot; is the first great song on the album, both lyrically and instrumentally. The Strokes greatest strength as a band is their ability to use dual guitars so distinctively. Albert Hammond Jr. and Nick Valensi seem to feed off of each other which is as it should be. Julian's lyrics are un-self concious on the song. He doesn't give a damn about fame, he just wants to have a good time. &quot;Under Control&quot; is the best song on the album. the song has a slow tempo, but the guitar parts are catchy even though they lack the flash of some of the other songs on the album. &quot;The End Has No End&quot; is the other great song on the album. The instrumentation is fantastic and it shows how these guys have grown as musicians. Julian's vocals sound angry instead of apathetic as they do on the album's lesser tracks.<BR>All in all I think that pigeonholing this band as a garage band is unfair. They are a rock band, and that's o.k.. A lot has been made of their dress and frankly that is unfortunate. People in the media should focus more on the music than their clothes. I am not disappointed in this album, in fact I like it quite a bit. The only reason I gave it three stars instead of four is that I would like to see better out of theses guys. I think they are capable of that.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|This is quality. I wasn't lucky enough to see them live on the rush of blood tour, and this is probably the next best thing. The concert DVD is the highlights of Parachutes and A Rush, and B-side One I Love, and new one Moses. I fell in love with the songs long ago, and they sound great live (especially A Rush Of Blood To The Head, the guitar at the beginning sounds better than on the album). The best thing is Chris having a go at dancing, in the words of NME, like a &quot;rock and roll morris dancer&quot;. He's gorgeous though, and he's so sweet, you can see he's putting his soul into the performance. I think that's one of the reasons why I love Coldplay, they're so genuine and honest, and it really comes through in the live performance. The CD is OK too, good quality, but some real highlights left off. Still a 5 star effort, just coz it's Coldplay, (love the beginning of Yellow).
B00004XONN|5.0|One of the greatest if not the second greatest musical journey ever after Amnesiac.  Kid A tells a story thats depth is not explainable.  Its of someone who is created in perfection, but what is perfect has no identity, it sees more, understands more than it should.  Something placed in this world that is of more than this world.  But despite being perfect Kid A is real and feels and sees all we do.  Deals with what we do.  The story of a perfect start but not a perfect life.<br />It has been said to be about a group of clones which Kid A was the first of.  Hence the repeated line when grappling with significance in Idioteque, &quot;The first of the children&quot;.<br />The feeling of being trapped in this world is present through out. Not just a worthy buy, a big loss to not have heard.
B000088E6D|3.0|This CD is a disappointment.  It's somewhat enjoyable because Michael Buble has a very smooth and pleasing-to-the-ear voice.  However, I'm surprised by some of the song choices and some arrangements are simply put - cheesy.  One reviewer described it with the terms &quot;shmaltz&quot; and &quot;bubbles&quot; and I believe those words accurately portray the overall feel of this CD.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I've been a fan of the Stripes for a couple of years so I have some perspective on their success and growth as a band. I love all of their albums, but to me \\"Elephant\\" stands out as their most important work to date. The reason for this is that it combines all the elements that make the White Stripes the greatest rock band in the world today. It is raw yet refined, contains outstanding musicianship, and the songwriting is spectacular. The first single \\"seven nation army\\", which just about everyone is familiar with at this point, features the most recognizable bassline of 2003(without actually being a \\"bassline\\"). It is followed up by the frenetic \\"Black Math\\", and then by the screaming guitar of \\"There's no home for you here\\" which is highlighted by some of the most impressive guitar pyrotechnics I've ever heard. Jack's lyrics on the album are the best of his career. He goes back and forth between tenderness, such as \\"I want to be the boy\\", to blues machismo, such as \\"Ball and Biscuit\\", to the raw angst of \\"The hardest button to button\\". Meg White drumming is simplistic, but that is what it needs to be for this album. You don't need to be Neil Peart to be a good drummer. She bears the entire weight of the rhythm section with grace, as usual, and even sings on \\"In the cold, cold night\\". The best track on the album is \\"Girl, you have no faith in medicine\\", which is classic White Stripes. \\"Elephant\\" is, in my opinion, the best album of the young century and is destined to be a classic.
B0001AP12G|5.0|First of all, I knew Kanye West had talent.  We all know his beats over the last few years have been some of the most stylistic and addictive in the music world. (and if you didn't know, you betta ax sumbody!!)  I knew this CD would be good, but damn...Kanye got rediculous on this one!  And being a college dropout myself with dreams of making it the music world, I instantly connected to this CD through the title alone.  Then I started listening to the music, the lyrics, the skits...I was sold after the first 2 songs, and the rest of the CD was far from a let down.  Right from the beginning, Kanye sets up an atmosphere of fun and goodtimes with his sarcastic, playful and honest lyrics and topics.  Still, he manages to be insightful and deep with songs like &quot;Jesus Walks.&quot;  And then there's the beats and production...so good, its RETARDED!!  Kanye's production style is so destinctive and striking - it just moves you.  Nor is he a slacker in the emcee department.  With his stylish cadances and melodic voice fluctuations, I give him an A+!  Yeah, I'm feeling this CD for sure...and I'm from Dallas (whats up with that &quot;music fan from Chicago&quot; dude who, in his review, tells people to suck a fat one if they're not feeling Chicago artist - especially if they're from Dallas???)  Anyway, I'm feelign a lot of artist from Chicago, so there!! The only reason i didn't give this CD 5 stars is because...aw F@#k it, im gonna change it to 5 stars....<BR>Kanye - let's be friends!!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First of all, I think Ms. Vincentelli (the Amazon.com reviewer) suffers from a lack of good taste.  This show not only has two of the best divas to ever grace a Broadway stage, it has a score that lifts you out of your seat, a script that has you laughing and crying by the end, and a design that awe-inspires the moment you walk into the theatre, before the show has even begun.  The supporting cast, including Michelle Federer, Norbert Leo Butz, and Joel Grey (though Grey is probably the weakest part of the show), give such amazing performances that they have surely locked a place for themselves in musical theatre for a good long time.  Loaded with complete characters, touching relationships, and a fantastical world and plot, not to mention $14 million worth of dazzling special effects, WICKED is a show that is worth a trip to New York just to see it!  Forget the reviews that tear it apart, because this show will likely play at the Gershwin Theatre for years to come.  And for Ms. Vincentelli's sake, I hope she invests in another trip to see this show, but this time with her eyes and ears open.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is the best rapping I have EVER heard.  The lyrics are amazing, both intelligent and fluid.  This is what rap should be and while there are only nine songs, they're all great.  The beats are not the best ever, but Nas' rapping skills make up for what the beats lack.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|In a film world of blatant and gratuitous violence, tasteless and shamless comedy, and pathetic writing and acting, this  movie simply would not appeal to many movie goers.  It did and would and does bore many people to tears.  It simply does not entertain in the classic \\"action-packed\\" sense.<BR>Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson act.  Acting is about conveying emotion without the necessity of gabbing endlessly.  <BR>This is a noisy and simplistic culture we live in, and this movie demands one's attention to get it.  <BR>It's not fast paced, it's not action packed, it's not \\"explosive,\\" it's not all about physical sex, it's not about simplistic answers to difficult stages people go through in their lives.<BR>This movie also captures the essence of Asia.  Asia is a rich and powerful place of conflicting social forces that pull hard between centuries of tradition and the emerging modern/techno society.<BR>The film's imagery is very rich.  Excellent photography.  The music wasn't bad either.<BR>As a total package, it's one terrific film.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Even having John Irving write the screenplay based on his own novel could not prevent this film's insufficiencies which include a lack of cohesion throughout much of the plot development. It begins quite well as the relationship between Homer Wells (Maguire) and Dr. Wilbur Larch (Caine) is effectively established. There are issues between them (e.g. pro life versus pro choice) as well as mutual affection and respect. Then the film sags when Homer leaves the St. Cloud Orphanage with Candy (Theron) and Wally (Rudd). He works in the Worthington orchard and falls in love with Candy while Wally is serving in the U.S. Air Force during World War Two. And then....<br /><br />I have great respect for director Lasse Hallstrom's work (My Life as a Dog, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Chocolat, and most recently, The Shipping News) and do not envy him as he struggled -- with mixed results -- to bring Irving's Academy Award-winning screenplay adaptation to life. There are several magical, memorable moments such as when Dr. Larch and later Homer \\"salute\\" the children when wishing them goodnight; also when the children compete for the attention of visitors to the orphanage, hoping to be selected. With regard to the acting, Caine received an Academy Award for best actor in a supporting role and everyone else in the cast performs well. The film score is at times intrusive but the cinematography is first- rate.<br /><br />However, the transitions from St. Cloud to the Worthington orchard to St. Cloud seem to me awkward. Moreover, the Rose family's problems were a distraction which reduced even more the momentum of the film's sometimes lumpy narrative. Overall, this film tries to ingratiate itself with those who see it in much the same way the orphans eagerly surround St. Cloud's visitors, clamoring for their preferential attention.<br /><br />That said, I am pleased to have seen this film and look forward to seeing it again. With all due respect to its charm (in large measure the result of the orphans, all of whom I wish I could adopt), this film raises a number of important issues and addresses them with appropriate respect and sensitivity.f whom I wish I could adopt), this film raises a number of important issues and addresses them with appropriate respect and sensitivity.
0385504209|5.0|From the moment I started reading this book, I found it hard to get away from it.  The storyline is beyond any suspense novel I have read.  The story leads off with the murder of the Louvre Museum's chief curator.  His death unfolds a turn of events that leads us through a path of intrigue as the story of a private society overshadows his own death.  In the end, his very own daughter must place together the clues he left as she follows the path of her father's codes to discover that this society had a rather impressive list of members throughout history to include Da Vinci and Isaac Newton amongst other historical geniuses.<br />Now comes the twister that has engulfed the world.  Is this book a fictional tale for entertainment or is there some truth to a secret society that historians have refused to acknowledge?
B00003CX5P|3.0|There has been so much back and forth about how this movie sucks, or how great it is. I want to make a few points clear.<BR>1) A movie is not great just because it's \\"Star Wars\\".<BR>2) A movie is not great just because it has magnificent CGI<BR>3) A movie is not great just because it has lots of action.<br />The Phantom Menace is actually not a BAD film. It's an enjoyable movie if you're expectations aren't so high. In other words,<BR>1) Don't expect characters like Han Solo, Leia or Luke to appear. The people in TPM are very different (and thank Lucas for that)<BR>2) Don't expect a beginning - end story like A New Hope. This film is made keeping in mind the vast amount of plot it has to cover to reach .... well, you know (let's not spoil it for people who are new to this series). In a sense, this acknowledges Episode IV as the core of the series. I agree.<BR>3) Don't expect a nasty Darth Vader type nemesis. The title \\"The Phantom Menace\\" obviously does not allude to a character named Phantom (I see the misunderstanding arising from the comic book Phantom connection). The phantom menace is the overhanging darkness that can be seen in the film, it's the first forming of the future empire, the first step towards total hopelessness in the galaxy (I don't think I've given anything away). So the title is actually very fitting, and suits the film well.<br />My complaints about the movie are these, though.<BR>1) I think the acting is sub-par. It's not consistently bad, bu it's strange that with so many acclaimed actors (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Pernilla August, etc.) this film never really engages you. I do think it has more to do with G. Lucas, since he's directing (and the acting quality has actually gotten worse in the sequel).<BR>2) The film is so overlaiden with plot that we never really get to know the characters, we never have a chance to fall in love with them. One mistake I think is that G. Lucas wanted to tell the story from the beginning. I think skipping parts of the plot (especially time-consuming bits that don't reveal much character) and trying to incorporate the information through, say, flash backs, or other ways might have been benefitial. <BR>3) Ultimately, and I think this is falls mostly on Lucas's shoulders, this movie doesn't know whose story to be. A New Hope was Luke's story (and then we got to know the other characters) and in a way, The Original Trilogy centered around Luke, the same way that the Prequel Trilogy should center around Anakin. But in this first film he rather gets overshadowed by the political story. Not that it's a bad political story, but it makes the film less personal.<br />So what DO I like then?<BR>1) It's a beautiful film, incredible visuals and a treat for the eyes. <BR>2) It has exciting action sequences, well choreographed battles and duels.<BR>3) It has great CGI, and gives us a clue of how the beloved Star Wars story started.<br />If you see my first three point you'll understand why this makes it merely mediocre. I suppose this film is better thought about than watched.<br />As far as the DVD goes, it's very well put together, with great picture and sound, and many extras. The prime reason for getting this DVD, though, was for the documentary \\"The Beginning\\", where G. Lucas raves about JJ Binks being the KEY to the movie, saying he's probably the funniest characters in the SW series. Also we get to see the screen tests (or auditions) for the last three choices for Anakin, where Jake Lloyd does the worst job of them all, quickly followed by G. Lucas's rave about this talent \\"He's perfect!\\"<br />If you're short on money, get something more worthwile, like Pirates of the Caribbean, Indiana Jones series, or Lord of the Rings (or the Original Trilogy as it'll be available September 21, 2004). You might even want to get the book version. If you have some money left over, though, this movie won't be the gem of any collection, but it won't bring shame over it either.
0517548232|5.0|For as important as Economics is to the Past, Present and Future of Humanity, its met with a collective yawn and almost completely missunderstood!  For just 20 bucks and 8 hours of your time you can have a mental grasp on the engine that drives...everything.  Unless you are completely vacant this book can change your mind.  Very important ideas.  Give this one to everyone you know.  If one person reads it, you have helped humanity.
0765342294|5.0|This book absolutely blew me away. The sheer brilliance of the novel was astounding. It took you to another dimension; one where human beings and buggers are rivals and pressure to save humanity lies solely on Ender's shoulders. The tests Ender goes through were extremely hard, both mentally and physically. You'd think he'd break, but it was Ender's strength and endurance that kept him going.  The imagination that went into a work like this is astonishing. Overall, I regard this book as a masterpiece. I commend Card for his work.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Originally buying this album because of the memories it had for me - a particular song that had been played at a &quot;dance&quot; with friends - I never thought I would love it for anything more than the few songs used. I am not often a fan of &quot;modern pop,&quot; my tastes being more akin to Bowie than Britney, but this album, though inferior to Shakira's earlier, less bleach-blonde-influenced &quot;Donde Estan las Ladrones&quot; has great vocal, Alanis-style excellent, though often oddly worded lyrics, danceable but still melodic music, and great skill - Shakira wrote the lyrics and music herself.<br />Although, I must say, I prefer the pre-blonde image of the performer, personally.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|This CD is definately not a step backwards. It starts strong and keeps going. The 10minute long &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; is a great song that also has great background talking effects (As in &quot;The Great Debate&quot; from 6DOIT) that include arguing and anger which really enhances the song. John Petrucci is ever getting better, the guitars sound even better than most of the other albums. And &quot;In The Name of God&quot; is a great song about false religious beliefs.<br />I highly reccomend this album to anyone who likes Dream Theater.

B00008BXJF|3.0|Many Crimson fans seem enthralled with this album.  I can't imagine why.  The band has regressed to an overdriven variation on heavy metal with an especially clean sound which reminds me very much of ground already plowed by Rush decades ago.<br />The material here kicks up dust in a few places but is mostly disappointing.  I was especially sad to hear Adrian Belew writing lyrics that revisit ground others have already visited - most notably &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; which combines a title used by Talking Heads (who Belew has played with, and must have an awareness of) with a lyrical idea used best by XTC (&quot;Across This Antheap&quot;) and Captain Beefheart (&quot;Ant Man Bee&quot;) in past.<br />I find both the music and lyrics here to cover ground already covered in past eras, and to provide little new.  AT least &quot;Level 5&quot; and &quot;Electric&quot; get their teeth into things though.
B0000UJL96|1.0|Have you ever purchased a MAJOR movie release which doesnt have a booklet or atleast a token insert?  Probably, NOT.  Except the executives at Paramount feel they can get away with it by short- changing the person most likely to loyally purchase the sixth installment of the Star Trek movies === the Star Trek fan.<br />You would think, that as the last movie with all the original cast that they would perhaps have included a commemorative signoff booklet or something.<br />Preying on the Star Trek fan's desire to have a &quot;complete set&quot;, <BR>Paramount is going to release all six movies as a boxed set which more than likely is going to include extras forcing the loyal fan to purchase (for the third time) all six movies again because this set WILL include that ever elusive booklet.
0385510438|5.0|This book is fantastic. I loved everything about this book, and it reminds me of one of Grisham's first book. The characters were so real and well-developed. There were really two plots going on in this book, and Grisham does a remarkable job of weaving these two plot lines together.<br />The author's sense of humor is sharper than ever. The author here in true form doing what he does best, and you get the sense of an author who has all the confidence in the world. There are few contemporary authors in pop literature to compare to this author.

I give this movie too thumbs up! TOTALLY!!!
B00005JMJ4|2.0|I've noticed reading these reviews that people who love this movie tend to knock those that don't because they think we wanted &quot;explosions&quot;, &quot;jokes about passing gas&quot; or other raunchy comedy scenes.  Please don't be fooled.  This is not an &quot;art&quot; movie.  It's not that Lost in Translation is boring--it's that it has no soul. Coppola does nothing to make the audience care about the charachters, or care about the plot. Those of you criticizing people who didn't like it need to get off your high horses.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Awful. Not a comedy by any stretch of the imagination. How anyone could call this movie &quot;flat out hilarious,&quot; as a Rolling Stone critic did, is &quot;flat out lying.&quot; Bill Murray fans, don't be fooled!

B000002L9M|5.0|The first of the mature DM albums, Black Celebration is 2nd only to Violator in rank of best DM albums. There are no fillers on this, only beautifully crafted works of art. \\"Black celebration\\" is a great song to start of the album. \\"Question of Lust\\" and \\"Stripped\\" start the pace after \\"Sometimes\\" and \\"It Doesn't Matter II\\". \\"New Dress\\" is a dark song about how simple minded people are. The album ends with \\"But Not Tonight\\". That is one of my favorite songs of all time. It also ends the album with a somewhat happy note which would lead into \\"Music for the Masses\\". All in all, not many albums can beat this 12 tracked masterpiece.

For those that fall for the myths that only the Bible is true and fact, would be outraged by what is told in this story, but this only is because of the narrowminds.

I loved it and will look forward to more like this.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye dropped a creative album upon us. Rap has become very redundant lately and the College Dropout is definitely a fresh breath of air. Production-wise this album is definitely on point. Kanye is excellent behind the boards and knows how to create hot beats. Lyrically, he may not be like Nas or Common but his flow balances nicely with the music. In my opinion, the standout tracks are All Falls Down, Two Words, School Spirit and Jesus Walks. The only thing though is that I wished he had kept \\"The Good,The Bad & The Ugly\\" from the advance copy. Nonetheless, cop this album now!    Much LOVE to Kanye

B000002I27|4.0|Strange Days is the Doors' followup to their stellar self-titled debut album and continues the high standard that was prevalent in all of their studio albums with Jim Morrison. While this album is best known for the excellent hit singles \\"People Are Strange\\" and \\"Love Me Too Times\\", many of the other tracks such as \\"Moonlight Drive\\", the tender \\"You're Lost Little Girl\\",  and the spooky title track are among their best work. Ray Manzarek's organ playing is strong throughout, particularly on the carnival-like \\"Unhappy Girl\\" and on the title track. Robby Krieger's playing is more laid-back here, added more for color although \\"Love Me Two Times\\" features one of his more memorable guitar riffs. The chaotic \\"Horse Latitudes\\" is certainly the weirdest track they've ever recorded but it fits in well considering the overall dark mood of the album. \\"When The Music's Over\\", their second 10 minute-plus epic in as many albums, is also a strong track, but not nearly as dramatic as \\"The End.\\" The tracks \\"My Eyes Have Seen You\\" and \\"I Can't See Your Face In My Mind\\" are decent, but aren't as strong as the rest of the album. A very solid album, but not an essential release like their debut album or Morrison Hotel.

B000002I25|5.0|The Doors came on the music scene during the Summer of Love in 1967. At this time bands like the Beatles, Jefferson Airplane, and The Grateful Dead were discovering psychedelia, and many singer-songwriters were singing of free love, free sex, and of the changing political and social times. However, the Doors, along with the Velvet Underground, were the first to bring decadence and darkness to rock music. Like Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix before them and bands like Primus and Tool many years after them, they had a distinguishable sound like no other. They had no bass player, the melodies were usually carried by Ray Manzarek's organ, Robby Krieger's guitar playing and John Densmore's drumming were more about mood rather than soloing, and Jim Morrison's poetic lyrics remain among the most creative ever written and his soothing vocals, at least on their first four albums, have been often imitated but never duplicated.<br />The Doors is the band's self-titled debut and one of many spectacular debut albums released in '67, which also included debuts by Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and Moby Grape. Nearly every track here is top notch. \\"Light My Fire\\" was their first of two #1 hits and remains their signature track. The long solos in the track, first by Manzarek, then by Kreiger, are as close to jazz as the band got and still sound amazing today. The opening track \\"Break On Through\\" is one of their most immediate tracks, featuring some of Morrison's most memorable lyrics. Other excellent tracks here include the pop-oriented \\"I Looked At You\\" and \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\", the rollicking \\"Alabama Song\\", the haunting \\"End Of The Night\\", the quiet, melodic \\"Crystal Ship\\", the blues of \\"Back Door Man\\", and the mid-tempo rock of \\"Soul Kitchen.\\" Finally, there's \\"The End\\", one of the darkest epics recorded in rock history. Like \\"Light My Fire\\", this song sounds incredible even today, going deep into Morrison's twisted psyche. The playing here again depends on mood, but Densmore's performance here is spectacular. The slow progression of the song up to its chaotic climax never fails to capture the listener's attention. Simply one of the best debut albums in rock history and highly recommended for all music fans.mance here is spectacular.

B0000C6JUK|5.0|I recently purchased the special edition of Sleeping with Ghosts and I think that the bonus cover tracks are the best. This cd is already amazing in its entirity, but the fact that it has the bonus cover tracks makes it that much more necessary for any Placebo fan. My two favorite tracks are &quot;Running up that Hill&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Melody Nelson.&quot; The live Pixie's cover of &quot;Where is my Mind&quot; and Depeche Mode's &quot;I Feel You&quot; also are up there. Honestly, I can't say that I don't like any of the songs. Placebo can do no wrong!

0385510438|5.0|Thanks goes out to John Grisham for a great book.  I've read all of his books before, and of lately they have been only so so.  Grisham wrote a great book after what I consider to be a slump.  THE LAST JUROR is a good read, a page-turner, and the John Grisham book we all love.  I suggest buying and reading this book.
B00005JKC3|2.0|Though I did not enjoy this movie at all, there are a couple of plus sides to this film, so I would like to begin my review by addressing those.   Firstly, there are a few good supporting performances caught up within this movie.  Oscar winner Jennifer Connelly turns in a fine performance as Betty Ross, the love interest of lead character Bruce Banner (Eric Bana).  She had very good chemistry with Eric Bana, providing him with his best scenes.  She was one of the few things in this film that made its length bearable.  Sam Elliot as General Ross (Betty's father) was also a welcome ingredient to an otherwise bland and uninteresting cast.  <br />The second factor that was well worth my attention in this film was the special effects.  Surprisingly, they turned out to be excellent.  The Hulk himself was very real looking, especially when David Banner (played by Nick Nolte) touched his face!  The movie could have stood to have more Hulk in it, as the few scenes with him are the only ones that try to be anything like the comic book!  In a day when rampant overuse of CGI has taken such hold, I am glad to see that something like the Hulk has actually made worthwhile use of it for a pleasant change.<br />Now, to the bad elements of this film.  Bogged down with way too much psycho drama for its own good, this film is mired in relentless flashbacks that never let up and  is hampered by endless story liberties taken by the director and writers.  Why fans tend to gripe about the alterations made in other superhero franchises is beyond me after seeing the liberties and changes made here. <br />Ang Lee is a good director, as proven by the performances in this and his previous works, but his decision to tamper with a good bit of the source material killed this film for me.  According to interviews, he was personally responsible for many of the \\"creative liberties\\" that were taken with the story.  The Hulk's continuing increases in size as he gets angrier was a horrible idea, reminding me more of King Kong at one point as opposed to the Hulk!  It was also a mistake to tamper with the Hulk's origins to such an extent.  Making  David Banner (Bruce's father, the name being a nod to the television series starring Bill Bixby) a psychopathic scientist who genetically experiments on his young son is completely wrong and actually steals away from the sequence in which Bruce gets blasted by Gamma rays in the laboratory accident years later.  <br />Using the last half of the film to turn David into the new super villain was the biggest mistake of all.  The merging of David's character and The Absorbing Man from the comic book results in one of the most ridiculous misrepresentations of a comic book villain in recent years.  The finale of the film, which sported a special effects filled clash between Bruce and his all powerful father, was a joke and made very little sense!  What happened?  The film was out of control at this point, but thanks to the director not knowing what an edit option is, the film kept going and going and going  while accomplishing nothing.  This seemimgly tacked on ending was there just to give ILM something BIG to do with Universal's money!  Lee really needs to remember how to edit a movie properly.  It was way too long for its own good, clocking in at a whopping 138 minutes.   <br />Lee's choice to panel so many scenes throughout  the film was very annoying after a little while.  This may work for a montage sequence or for opening credits, but to rely on a this technique throughout a whole film??  Very bad decision to be sure.  He has stated that he wanted to remind us that we were watching a comic book movie.  Does he think that we, the audience, don't already know that?   Well, we are watching Lee's \\"artistic\\" version of the Hulk.<br />I actually cannot comment on Eric Bana as an actor outside of the Hulk film, for I have never seen any other film that he has starred in. I can say, however, that I was not very pleased with his performance as Bruce Banner, but I really do not place the blame on his acting skills, but rather on the overdose of psychological problems presented by the script.  Everything Bana did with his performance was on the spot, but for me the material bogged his character down incredibly. I think I would have liked Bana had he been presented with differing material and characterization to work with!  As for Nick Nolte, I feel that he was miscast in the role of David Banner.  He chews lots of scenery, but is ultimately wasted in the role.<BR> <BR>Danny Elfman has delivered many fine film scores during his career.  His score this time around, however, was very lacking as far as enhancing this film goes.  There was a complete lack of any kind of theme for one thing, which should never be the case in a film of this type.  The eastern influences heard throughout the soundtrack were very out of place for a movie set solely in America!  Perhaps it would play better as an isolated soundtrack minus the movie, but as a companion to the film, it did nothing for it at all.  This is a cardinal sin in movie soundtracks!  If a score fails to enhance your movie going experience, then why was it there to begin with?<br />As usual, the movie studio over-hyped their big summer release.  They aimed this psychodrama at children, not realizing that they will be the ones least interested in the long, confusing, uninteresting story sprinkled with only a handful of action sequences!  Is it really a wonder why this movie ended up being such a disappointment at the box office?  Oh well, they had to sell toys somehow didn't they!

0440237688|5.0|Referred to me by my wife, an elementary teacher, I was not especially excited at first to read this book. But, being an avid reader and believing that every book deserves a chance, I picked up The Giver and very soon found that I couldn't put it down. The Giver is the story of Jonas, a boy who lives in a futuristic 1984-esq society, where everything appears to be perfect. Selected to become the next \\"Receiver of Memory,\\" the most important role in the community, Jonas is sent for training to a man who gives his name only as \\"The Giver.\\"<BR>Although a little slow to start, the story quickly picks up as Jonas begins to see the world in a way he never imagined before, and the reader quickly begins to see a world that we may not be to far from, a world that we may want to avoid creating at all costs.<BR>As a future teacher myself, I feel confident in saying that the book itself is fairly easy reading, and could probably be read as early as 4th or 5th grade. The content, however, may be more appropriate for middle school or even high school. While the story does work on several levels, and could be understood by younger kids, there is a scene in the book that may be disturbing for them. But that is, in the end, the overall purpose of the book: to disturb us, to make us think and consider the nature of humanity and the cost of \\"perfection.\\"<BR>The Giver is a truly amazing book, one written with eerie clarity and foresight, one that could change your way of thinking in many, many ways.
B00005LC1H|5.0|&quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; is one of those rare comedies that not only can be watched on repeated occasions, but positively demands it.  According to the DVD, each episode -- of which there were 12 -- took 4 months to write, and it's all there for you to see.  Glorious, funny, laced with bile and stuffed with truth, &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; was written out of &quot;deep anger&quot;, according to Prunella Scales (Sybil Fawlty), like most of the greatest comedies. I love the series to death and recommend it unreservedly.  Perfection.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Stop listneing to what all these other guys are sying about DT's latest release, and just buy it already.  This album is allready better than its predecessor 6 degrees of bordom.  Allright the first disk was good, but the title track was not up to DT quality.  Train of Thought brings back some of the great music we first heard from DT on Awake, with heaveier music, thats alot more entertaining
0385504209|2.0|Well, I finally gave in and read this book for one of my book clubs, and was extremely disappointed.  It was a ridiculous Hollywood script from beginning to end!<br />The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did ignite one of the most interesting discussions I've had in a book club.  But in the end, we all agreed that the book came nowhere near to living up to the hype!
B00008J4P5|5.0|If I can compare this rockin band with any other, it has to be the mighty Led Zeppelin. White Stripes music is astonishing with great guitar riffs and the vocals are unforgettable. Seven Army Nation is a great introductory song, but let me tell you, and you've heard it on the radio a million times, but it is only the beginning of greatness. Black Math and Little Acrons are just great songs, makes you grateful that even though modern contempory music sucks, you still have bands dishing out great music. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant would be proud, or probably are of this great band, oh, did I mention that De Stiji, and White Blood Cells are excellent albums too.
B00005T7I1|2.0|This movie has its ups and downs - Warren Beatty does a solid job as Dick Tracy, Madonna does a good job as Breathless (you can tell she really worked hard to get it right), Glenne Headly does ok with the faithful Tess, and Pacino plays a great over the top villain.  <br />The thing about this film is that it could have been really good with everything it had going for it.  But the very tricks that Beatty (as director) tries to use to draw us further into the comic world are distracting, and keep reminding us that we're watching a movie.  This is particularly seen in the villains - many of them have comic features - watermelon heads, completely flat heads, no face, etc - an interesting approach.  However, they are so completely grotesque and bizarre that it's hard to not flinch every time you see one - it's very much like watching a nightmare you think you might have one day.  <br />Steven Sondheim's music is, of course, fabulous - you can buy the soundtrack for this movie used on Amazon for about $2 - check it out.<br />With a stronger plot, and better writing and scripting, it could have been good.  But instead it feels like something Tim Burton would have made when he was in the 4th grade.  <br />See it if you like comic book movies.  Otherwise, if you're in the mood for a dark movie that relates to comic books, check out something like Unbreakable or Batman.  <br />Sincerely,<br />Thomas
0385510438|5.0|This plot and the fully-realized characters bring back the basics of good storytelling at which Grisham excelled in his earlier work.  An example of the reason we all flocked to buy his work once upon a time.  Highly recommended.

B0000C9V3T|5.0|I love the seemingly random way that Tarantino has picked the music for this movie, like all his movies, he picks soundtracks not on the basis of tie-in potential, but because he feels they are relevent to the story or the atmosphere in some way. My favourite is Battle Without Honor or Humanity, but I love Whoo Hoo by the 5,6,7,8s and Bang Bang.

B000002LK1|5.0|Definitely Depeche Mode's best CD and one of the best CD's ever.  Every song on Violator is fantastic and anyone who doesn't think this record deserves 5 stars is flat out wrong.
B000089CJI|3.0|I strangely bought this on a whim along with the Notwist's Neon Golden, and I was surprised to seeat first that they were quite similar in basic structure.  Compared side to side, however, they are more like flipsides of the same coin.<br />While Notwist's album is more moody, somber, spare, and restrained, this is a much more busy, less genre-bending, and chipper album, complemented by Ben Gibbard's and Jen's vocal interplay.  The general mood is poppy, with its low-key moments, and the subject matter dealing more with the difficulties of relationships, and the (sometimes black) humor present in our personal lives today than the grander feel of Notwist's effort.<br />The record starts off strongly with &quot;The District Sleeps Tonight,&quot; a paean to unrequited love, but seems to follow the drum-machine/guitar formula a bit too strongly for the first half, despite some terrific melodies (&quot;Clark Gable&quot; for example).  Later on a more trip-hop/drum &amp; bass feel prevades the proceedings, giving the music a bit more edge.  The tunes in general remain poppy throughout, a less overbearing Depeche Mode in a way.  Gibbard's lyrical sensibilities could use some work, but they are made up by moments of genius.  Overall a unique and fairly strong release and a significant addition to the electronic canon.
B00005JMCN|5.0|I love reading the reviews bashing Seabiscuit.  A sign of times when you can't enjoy a great story about an underdog with no cynacism or modern day histrionics.<br />I loved it, I cheered for Seabiscuit.  I bet you will too....
B000089RVX|4.0|I was never interested in hearing this band.  I was actually in another country when I heard their first single \\"Bring Me To Life,\\" but I never paid attention because I'm very far from a rock/goth type of person, I usually like vocalists and what not...<BR>...little did I know Amy Lee IS a vocalist.  She is an amazing singer, with a haunting touch that works perfectly for these kinds of songs.  There have been \\"complaints\\" that most of the songs sound the same...well, I see it as there are two basic types of songs, the ballads and the rock songs.  They are sort of similar, but it's a good thing to me.  I guess I'll follow the crowd with review writing and do it song by song:<br />01-Going Under- Overall, probably my favorite song on the CD.  It's an incredible blend of the strong rock sound, and her amazing voice.  In some songs her voice almost seems too good for the songs, but it works perfectly here.  This song alone has a two-octave range (which she can sing live) and that's so hard.  The chorus of \\"I'm dying again\\" is just awesome, and it's hard but I find it relaxing.  10/10<br />02-Bring Me To Life- Nearly everyone has heard this song.  I never really listen to the radio so being \\"overplayed\\" was never a factor.  It's a very good choice for the first single.  It's a great song, good lyrics, and awesome everything else.  8.5/10<br />03-Everybody's Fool- This had to grow on me...and it has.  Her voice is incredibly strong in this song.  She just punches through the song, and goes soft on the haunting chorus.  Really really good. 9/10<br />04-My Immortal- W O W!  Absolutely beautiful.  The first version I had didn't have the violins that come with the CD, and it's a beautiful touch, giving the violins a big part of the song, sharing it with her astounding voice.  This song gives you chills everytime...just perfect.  10/10<br />05-Haunted- Honestly, I used skip past this one.  With other songs that I loved from the first measure, this one got skipped to get to those (Hello, namely).  However, once I bought the CD (let me add, that the CD sounds infinitely better than the stuff I downloaded at first) and listened through it, this is just as great, but the best part is the lyrics. 9/10<br />06-Tourniquet- I personally find this song to be a bit repetitive, but it's a really good song.  She sings well, it has an interesting beginning, and again, I normally skip over it, but it's good.  8/10<br />07-Imaginary- I like this song more and more.  It starts out very different, and it works its way into the rock genre.  It has a really nice tune, and as usual, her voice just soars. 8.5/10<br />08-Taking Over Me- I really like this one, but there isn't a lot to say about it.  It's a rock song, with a nicer twist. 8/10<br />09-Hello- Unpopular, and it's one of my favorites, just as good as \\"Going Under\\" to me.  This one gives me chills.  It's just so relaxing, haunting, and beautiful.  This is even more just her voice than \\"My Immortal\\" and it's so peaceful at first, and it builds to this incredible climax.  Beautiful piano, as well.  10/10<br />10-My Last Breath- Another one that grew on me.  It's awesome, just such a great sound and lyrics and voice.  I love this one. 9.5/10<br />11-Whisper- This was the most different on the CD from my downloaded song.  What was my least favorite has jumped up, if for nothing else than the range of Amy's voice displayed here.  Her near descante in the middle of the song was surprisingly good, and she belts some of her most impressive notes toward the end.  Vocals aside, it has great rhythm and lyrics. 9.5/10<br />*The band version of \\"My Immortal\\" is awesome.  I personally liked it with just a piano (and violins for the CD version), but in terms of her voice, it's much stronger here in terms of belting the notes out flawlessly.  I still listen to all three versions...they're all so great.  10/10<br />Do the band and yourself a favor and purchase the CD, not just downloading it.  The quality pays foritself, and this is a band that deserves to be supported.  Congratulations on its two well-deservd Grammys!
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this CD 2 weeks ago. It is almost the only CD that I have been listening to lately. Her music can be sort of morbid but I find it refreshing from all the teeny bop love songs. &quot;My Immortal&quot; is one of my favorite songs. However, I am beginning to like &quot;Tourniquet&quot; just as much. A few of her songs are playing over and over on the radio but I can listen to it all the time. I do too! She sings so well and strong. It is not like the other singers and musicians that get drowned out by fancy equipment. I have never listened to goth before but I do think it is more heavy rock than anything. Yes, this CD appears as heavy rock from my MP3s. I do not think of it as heavy rock but what do I know. My CD collection is varied so I am open to all types of music. I find this CD a wonderful addition to my collection. I do not think that I will get tired of listening to it.
B00006879E|4.0|Hey! If you like the canadian band \\"Wide Mouth Mason\\" you should like Maroon 5. When I first heard them I really thought they WERE Wide Mouth Mason! =o) Their styles really compliment eachother as far as the \\"funkyness\\" that they throw into their songs. If you enjoyed this CD check out Wide Mouth Mason.<BR>~*~Bethany
B00005JLH3|5.0|Charles Stone III`s crowd-pleasing drama/comedy spotlights the previously never done world of university marching bands more specifically, the cutthroat world that energizes Southern black campuses. Devon Miles (Nick Cannon) is a Harlem teenager who receives a full scholarship to attend Atlanta A&T University based on his excellent percussion talents. However, making the transition from hip-hop street drumming to the drumline of the school`s legendary marching band is more challenging than Miles expected. For one, the band director, Dr. Lee (Orlando Jones), is determined to reclaim the national championship using old-school tactics, even though his traditional beliefs appear to be leaving A&T in the dust. And then there is Sean (Leonard Roberts), the current drum leader, who is threatened by Devon`s skills and frustrated by his fierce individuality. These  forces, as well as the addition of a cheerleading love interest (Zoe Saldana), combine to test Devon`s previously unshakeable confidence. As the season builds toward the BET Big Southern Classic and a showdown with rival Morris Brown University, Devon must swallow his pride and learn to be a team player if he wants his band to win the championship. DRUMLINE proves that any subject can make for an invigorating work of entertainment, if handled properly.<br />The movie has a number of talented young actors robert leonard,jason weaver (switched,smart guy), GQ Jayson ( drumline, what's the worse that can happen, on the line).
B00004RF8J|5.0|A film by Frank Oz<br />\\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" is the sort of movie that I did not expect to like when I started watching it.  I remember seeing bits and pieces of the movie when I was a child, and to be honest, the talking plant kind of freaked me out.  So, while the talking plant is still a little freaky, I was surprised that I actually liked the movie as much as I did.  \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" is a comedy/musical based on a stage play that was based on an older horror movie of the same title.  It's also a good movie.<br />Seymour (Rick Moranis) is a timid, mousy man working at florist's shop for Mr Mushnik (Vincent Gardenia).  He is afraid to speak up or really express his feelings for his co-worker, Audrey (Ellen Greene).  We see in a flashback how Seymour acquires a peculiar plant which he calls Audrey II (voiced by Levi Stubbs from the Four Tops) and puts it in the front window of the store.  Immediately business picks up and this plant becomes a huge attraction.  Seymour takes care of the plant, feeding it with his own blood (from his fingers), it is the only thing the plant will eat.  When it grows it begins to speak and the first thing it says is \\"feed me, Seymour\\".  Audrey II wants to eat...the plant wants flesh and blood.  Seymour doesn't want to kill anyone to feed Audrey II, but the plant is insistent.  It isn't until Seymour sees how Audrey's boyfriend Orin Scrivello (Steve Martin), a dentist, treats her that he begins to think that he can feed Audrey II.  As the movie continues, Audrey II gains more and more media attention and Seymour is invited on talk shows and is on the cover of magazines but he is still dealing with the fact that Audrey II needs to keep feeding.<br />This is a strange premise for a movie, and it is, in fact, a strange movie.  The songs are quite good and well sung (I'm partial to \\"Suddenly Seymour\\"), and this is a fun movie.  It is different than perhaps every other musical out there, but if you want a good movie about a talking plant that eats people, this is your film.  If you just want a good musical, this is still your film.  It has a strange subject, but give it a chance.  It'll grow on you.  Pun intended.ng plant that eats people, this is your film.

0486211045|4.0|This book is filled with pictures. George B. Bridgeman did a great job with this book. The reason I gave only 4 starts is beacuse it was kinda hard to understand. I mean I spent 20 min. figuring out the introduction and still dont full understantd it. But farther into the book it was easier to understand but still difficult. I am only 13 and this book may have been written for college students or adults so that may have been one reason I dont unerstand so well but once you start picking it up you learn a lot of stuff about the human anatomy. THIS IS GREAT FOR COMIC BOOK ARTISTS, AS WELL AS ANY OTHER ARTIST.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I picked this up a year or so ago to get it back into my library, my last version being on 8 track!  Oh how sweet to hear her again.  This is a brilliant work, one of the best examples of pure lyric and music composition and heartfelt singing of all time.  Guaranteed timeless.  There should be more than 5 stars.  Thanks Carole!
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion has such a wonderful voice and such amazing talent. Her voice has such soul and passion! Celine has recorded many great CDs and this one is no exception and if you haven't bought any of Celines albums and are looking to buy a good one THIS IS IT. All The Way is great from start to finish and I like all her Cds, but this one is my favorite.
B0001AP12G|5.0|In a world where having the big cars, the beautiful girls, and the stacks of money, someone shines through the stereotype, and brings a new style. His name is Kanye West. He overcame tragedy; he didn't get shot 9 times, rather, he got into a car accident which was near-death. He then changed his style, developing some of the hottest beats heard in a long time. He digs deep in songs like &quot;Family Business&quot;, a song about his family, and how they act. He reflects on his acciden and some of his past in &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; featuring Rocafella associate, Jay Z. On his last track, titled &quot;Last Call&quot;, Kanye West talks about how he got to where he is, in about twelve minutes. The College Dropout is one of the greatest albums of the year because its different. It doesnt talk about the stereotypical things that rap is associated with. 5 stars out of 5.
0385504209|2.0|Well!  Dan Brown sure has written a successful book, hasn't he?  Best seller for many weeks.  This book is eye candy.  Discerning readers among you, you know what I mean.  I read it in a day.<br />But don't kid yourself.  This book isn't researched, or in any way accurate in the details.  It's a plot spun, interestingly enough, around little kernels of sketchy 'information'.  Just FORGET about Constantine's role in the canonization of Scripture! Dan Brown should be ashamed of himself for suggesting he's done good research. Now if you want to read a better source for all of this, I suggest books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail or The Woman with the Alabaster Jar, or better, The Feminine Face of God.
B00005JKC3|2.0|The Good:<br />Sam Elliot as General &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross.  He could have carried the film as the main antagonist rather than playing second fiddle to Nick Nolte as Banner's Father, and Josh Lucas as Talbot.  He turned out a solid and entertaining performance in a very dull film.  This was a breakthrough performance out of someone I used to think was strictly a B-list actor.  I must retract this opinion as of seeing this performance.<br />The special effects of The Hulk we very well done and effectively captured the magnitude of his rage and strength.  The roughly 15-20 minutes of action were decent.<br />The Bad:<br />Complete rubbish!!! Ang Lee should NEVER have been given the honor of directing this film.  They should call this Ang Lee's The Hulk, like Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula.  This is NOT an even remotely accurate re-telling or entertaining version of the classic tale that was originally told by Stan Lee &amp; Jack Kirby.  Why bother with a gamma bomb?  Why bother with Rick Jones who was the main believer in, conscience of, and best friend to The Hulk and Banner?  Let's just re-write it to where his dad did genetic testing on himself so we can get Nick Nolte (looking like a total derelict) in the film in the feeble hopes of name recognition.  The character of Banner's father could have been completely removed from the film and the only effect would have been value added.  I took my girlfriend to see this at the show, and she FELL ASLEEP during the LOUD battle, which was the climax of the film because she was so bored by the slow and predictable pace!!!!!!!  The Hulk is ACTION!!!!!  The Hulk is RAGE!!!  HULK SMASH!!!!!!!<br />The Ugly:<br />Nick Nolte's appearance and same performance that I have seen since Down and Out in Beverly Hills.<br />Jennifer Connelly's wooden performance as Betty Ross was a nice way of making a sympathetic yet strong female character in the comic books, into a stereotypical female damsel in distress.<br />Last but certainly not least, Eric Bana's 2 dimensional rendition of an incredibly complex character battling the monster within reduced to a whiny gibbering wretch of a man.not least, Eric Bana's 2 dimensional rendition of an incredibly complex character battling the monster within reduced to a whiny gibbering wretch of a man.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Wow, another manufactured band, another lazy recording, another rendition of a band that only knows 2 chords and 3 beats. You're kidding me right? saviors of rock and roll? grammy nominations? PLAYING AT THE GRAMMYS? this has got to be some sick joke. seirously. Rock is in a really sorry state if thewy are asaying that this is unique different, and tasteful.  I finr more uniqueness in the chipmunks than this garbage. GOOD MUSIC? YOU CALL THIS GOOD MUSIC? put it this way, there is an extremely amazingly fantastic great use for this CD. a frisbee. any other use of this CD is a waste of the pertoleum distillates that this CD was made from. OK, why is it bad you ask? well, you have 2, count 'em 2 people, one guitarist, and one drummer, both of which have almost nil musical talent. How is that you ask? well, when you have their most popular single(7 nation army), playing the same chord and stanza, and the ONLY variation in the entire song is a chorus with no lyrics that has only one minor difference from the other parts. it is in a higher key and is a chord instead of picxking strings. ohh, so hard, and hardly talent. the singin is off key and just terrible, and drumming, oh, i can beat a floor tom and a bass drum and slam the high hat together all at the same time too. it is literally that simple, that talentless, and that pathetic. I can't believe that this crap is being toted as good mucis, talented music, and music that will have you buying CDs for years to come. OH, i almost forgot, and if the useless talent wasn't enough, they have to go and rob other people's songs and cover them to fill an album out(see: Burt Bacharach, \\"i dont know what to do with myself\\"). C'mon, people, tehre's a ton of better stuff out there, stuff with talent, stuff that makes you think, wow, this is MUSIC, not garbage to fill my ears, stuff that isnt shoved down your throats by a radio station that is being paid major bucks to play the crap out of the record becasue some music producer madea really bad decision and dumps a ton of money on a really crap band thinkin he's gonna make a killing and then realizing what kinda garbage it is, and seeing his job and future flash before his eyes, so he tries to hide it to what he hopes is a mindless and useless public that will buy anything that someone with influence says is good BECAUSE HE IS PAID TO SAY SO. anyways, to wrap it up, this album sux, has absolutely no useful talent whatsoever to speak of, can't write good music, and fills an otherwise useful piece of plastic with ones and zeros that combined make for a really boring, mindnumbing, repetitive, and terrible album. You owe it to yourself. DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM, don't numb your mind to this. Listen to talent, to people that actually write their own music coherently, that are able to play more than 2 chords and 3 beats on their instruments, and that play music BECAUSE THEY ENJOY IT, not because they have dollar signs in their eyes. Buy something good. you deserve it.
0064400557|5.0|Charlotte's Web - the first time I laid my eyes on this book was on an old dusty bookshelf in an old long forgotten lane of Bombay and I did not intend picking it up - till the book called out to me and demanded to be read. It demanded that I pick it up and I did. <br />Having said that, I have no regrets reading this one - though meant for kids and pre-teens who said a twenty-three year old cannot discover the child in him? Reading Charlotte's Web was discovering the child in me. The child I thought had long disappeared from my life...<br />What is Charlotte's Web all about? To put it plainly...its only about a Spider and a Pig. Or is it? There is more to it. It is about Wilbur - a pig who is saved by Fern - a little girl living on the farm in Pennsylvania - with her parents and brother. Till one fine day Wilbur has to be kept at her uncle's farm - due to the obvious reason - Space Constraints. Everything is going fine - till Wilbur realizes that he will soon become meat on the Christmas Table.<br />Enter: Charlotte : The friendly neighbourhood Spider - who cares for Wilbur like no one else has ever...A true friend and how she saves him from his death...<br />What I liked about this story: The way it was written - the simplicity that evolves throughout the book...and all that it asks us to be is humane - which is so difficult for humans...Eventually Fern also gives up on Wilbur - here E.B. White brings forth the point - humans do not care for animals as soon as they mature, and eventually move on...<br />Read this one...to find out how Charlotte saves Wilbur's life...and the end...
B0000029DD|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  The first time I heard it, I was in France of all places.  One of my friends put it on the CD player at a party, and I was hooked.  From the opening of the first song -- which, besides a great guitar line and interesting intstrumentation, has amazing vocals and a wonderful hook -- to the last, there wasn't a bad number.  My personal favorites are &quot;Hallelujah&quot; (just like everyone else, but his guitar playing is so pristine and bell-like in its clarity that I have to marvel), &quot;Lover, You Should Have Come Over&quot; (more great guitar, profound lyrics and a great melody), and &quot;Corpus Christi Carol&quot;.  The last is by Benjamin Britten, a 20th-century classical composer.  I can only assume that the vocal part is intended for a woman, because JB sings it entirely in falsetto -- and not just a falsetto, but the kind that many trained classical vocalists would love to have.  (Incidentally, these three songs are right in order on the CD.)<br />If you like intelligent guy-with-a-guitar pop music, you absolutely must own this.  His guitar playing is excellent; his songwriting is excellent; and his voice is superlative.
7119005901|3.0|Ok, Three Kingdoms is a amazing volume which mixes history with mythlogy during the three kingdom period of china's past. It really is a great story! The only bad part is that this volume seems like a rough draft. There are literally tons of spelling errors and mis-use of english language. Obviously they should have put more effort into translating this better for the english audience. And the price of $39.99 is a bit hefty for 4 paper-back books! I would look for a different translation for a cheaper buy.
B0001906O0|4.0|This pretty terrific box of b-sides and rarities was originally issued in the UK and has now been released here in America. Though it's a welcome collection anywhere, it was intended for a British audience, so space is consumed by songs which most US fans have already, while some material that's probably easier to obtain in England is sadly excluded. <br />For example: 10:15 Saturday Night, Plastic Passion, Just One Kiss, The Dream, The Upstairs Room, Lament, and Speak My Language have all been available for years in America on such albums as Japanese Whispers and Boys Don't Cry. While stuff like Curiosity, Carnage Visors, and the club mix of the Boys Don't Cry single were only briefly available in America (generally on cassette) and at stiff import prices. Maybe these gems will appear as bonus tracks on the forthcoming reissues, but it's an expensive hassle to rebuy albums you've had and played for years just for a handful of otherwise ungettable tunes that could easily have been included here. So much exquisite care went into the liner notes and packaging of this four-disc set that it might have been worth the extra time to prepare a US version to satisfy Cure completists on this side of the pond. <br />I also think there are some rare but useless songs on this compilation that again just fill space. Do we really need multiple versions of mediocre covers like Hello I Love You and Purple Haze? And the remixes are almost all inferior to the originals. <br />My complaints are kinda nit-picky, but since only hardcore fans will likely purchase this box set, buyers should probably be aware of them. <br />In sum, Join The Dots is a highly enjoyable release that needlessly falls just short of perfection.
B00002SSKI|4.0|The charm of this movie comes mostly from the &quot;Then&quot; part.  It is the charm of the four young actresses (Christina Ricci acting as the young Roberta is my personal favorite but all four are great) that is able to give this movie a candid fresh feeling in spite of the somewhat corny cliched story which you feel you have already seen. Was it &quot;stand by me&quot; which had four friends, each with a different character type? No, that was about boys... Here as well we have a mystery as the girls are trying to solve the death of a young boy, and the outcome can be anticipated. The adult part - although equipped with a group of well-known actresses was not able to convince me (it is surprising to note that the casting of Rosie Odonnol as the adult Christina Ricci is very believable although funny at first sight). How is it that in the movies all the young people portrayed grow up to be really outstanding writers, actresses, doctors, etc.? What happened to all the ordinary people we all grew up to be? The adult part is a little too short and not too satisfying. I would have been interested to know what happened to these 4 women since that one summer we had a chance of seeing. The movie makes it seem as if their lives - or rather their friendship was somewhat stopped at the age of 12 and then continued  at the adult stage. What happened since the age of 12? I mean, they did live next to each other...are there no memories from later, maybe more important stages of life? Were there no old grudges or new friends that interfered? Did they not prefer to have one intimate friend rather then a group?<BR>I think that the movie could have been &quot;full&quot; with only the young, &quot;then&quot; part, however nice to watch as it is. I found the movie's special moments to be in the sincere intimate moments were only two of the four friends are seen conversing about more serious issues.
B00004LN16|4.0|&quot;You can't stop rock and roll,&quot; barks Brian Johnson on track number 7 off &quot;Stiff Upper Lip.&quot;  Apparently, you can't stop AC/DC either.  In the thirty-odd years these guys have been around, they've bypassed every known musical trend (classic rock, disco, punk, new wave, techno, and elctronica) while leaving their sound virtually unchanged.  And why should they bother?  If it ain't broke, don't fix it, and on their umpteenth album, they've given more of the same head-banging rock to please old and new fans alike.  Produced by George Young (the elder brother of guitarists Angus and Malcolm), we get killer guitar riffs, catchy choruses, and enough double-entendres to make Austin Powers proud.  These guys have clearly aged and have somewhat mellowed a bit since the glory days of &quot;Back in Black,&quot; but the energy is undeniably present.  &quot;Safe in New York City,&quot; &quot;Hold Me Back,&quot; and &quot;House of Jazz&quot; deliver the goods as only AC/DC can deliver them.  The album lacks one straight up classic in the vein of &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot; or &quot;TNT,&quot; but even so, &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot; is a very solid record from &quot;the thunder from down under.&quot;
B00000DOYR|5.0|To say Back In Black is a great C.D. is an understatement. Sure, many AC/DC fans were worried that Brian Johnson wouldn't fill the shoes of Bon Scott. In some ways he didn't (vocal-wise) but in many ways he did. He presented rock just as it should be -- Loud, Wild and Out of Control! This C.D. is a tasty addition to any AC/DC collection. Matter of fact, this C.D. is one of the ten greatest selling C.D.'s of all time (world wide). The C.D. has great tracks like Hells Bells, Shoot To Thrill, Givin The Dog A Bone, Have A Drink On Me, You Shook Me All Night Long, Rock And Roll Ain't Noise Pollution and the title track. Some critics (well most) jumped this C.D. seemingly before they even listened to it. This is rock n roll -- meant to be played loud and often.
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is one of his greatest achievments, but sadly, after this album, his music took a downfall.  It marks the end to a series of four far-from-average albums: 1)Space Oddity 2)Man Who Sold the World 3)Honky Dory 4)and finally, Ziggy. Soon he would  become less of an artist and more of a pop icon to be laughed at by future generations. A sad ending to a short but great legacy. <br />Ziggy is a good representation of all of bowies styles.  From psychadelic folk to proto punk madness to jazz. It's a journy into another dimension. I'm not going to waste your and my time summarizing all of the songs.  Just have a listen, its not something you can put into words.
B000002IJA|4.0|Many say that this is either a soundtrack (Maximum Overdrive) or a greatest hits, or both. I disagree. I feel it's another C.D. to make money, but who better to put it out than AC/DC? I own the digitally remastered C.D. and it sounds great. Of course people are going to complain about this C.D., but people who love each and every one of AC/DC's C.D.s -- will love this one just the same. This C.D. has great tracks like the title song, You Shook Me All Night Long, DT, Sink The Pink, Hells Bells, Shake Your Foundations, Chase The Ace and For Those About To Rock, We Salute You. In my opinion this C.D. might just be for hardcore AC/DC fans, though some will love it just as much. For me, it's simple --- it's AC/DC!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is hot like fiyre, it's rare that you find an album where every song that you hear just catches you like this one does.  EVERYONE needs to own a copy of this album.  Kanye does his d*** thing on this album, so COP it!
B0000DD7NL|5.0|This girls Cd is so sureal, it almost feels as if you are in the room with her while she is writing and recording. It is so much more personal than her first, which by the way I would give 4 stars to out of 5. I first listened to it while I was journaling at my home and I had to stop and say damn this is deep. I recommend this Cd if you listen to the music for the lyrics as I do not caring about the artist or genre.
B00013PHGS|5.0|one of the best cds i've picked up in a while.  I was similarly surprised by the notwist too.  songs are both mellow and upbeat and i sing along to some of them.  great stuff although I must say i can't say the same about Moon Safari which i ordered as well.  After all the &quot;groundbreaking&quot; talk i should give that another listen.
B00006AW2F|5.0|&quot;Metamorphosis&quot; was originally released in 1975 when they were still the hottest band in America. It reached number eight in America and a dismal number forty - five in the UK. In America, it was their 21st album and their 17th in their home country. Taken from the vaults of ABCKO and pieced together to make a complete album, the results were actually well.<br />Among my favorite tracks are the early (ie: Brian Jones) years. Here is where you'll find such stunning rarities like &quot;I'd Much Rather Be With The Boys&quot; and &quot;Walkin' Through The Sleepy City&quot; (the latter sounds like a Beach Boys outtake), a bluesy cover of Chuck Berry's &quot;Don't You Lie To Me&quot; and alternate versions of &quot;Out Of Time&quot; (featuring a nice string arrangement) and &quot;Heart Of Stone&quot; (with a nice acoustic guitar punctuating it). Of the later (ie: Mick Taylor) years, there's a cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Don't Know Why&quot; that is one of the best unreleased number in the Stones vault, the Bill Wyman composition &quot;Donwtown Susie&quot;, and the funky &quot;Jivin' Sister Fanny&quot;.<br />I really think that is a great album. It represents how great they were as a band, and a lot of songs are very intimate and not very fast, a side of them we hardly ever see (even &quot;Angie&quot; and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; seemed a little too rocky). Overall, I suggest you purchase it.
0743243307|1.0|I have to seriously wonder in this day of ubiquitous books by the South Asian diaspora, what makes a novel wrestle and rise to the top? What makes an author garner the distinction of Granta? What makes a book the topic of literary and popular conversations? Surely, it can't be a pretty author photograph on the back of a book jacket. Nor can it merely be the author's point of origin, and now chosen place of residence. <br />Please restore my faith in the idea that a book's sole merit lies in the quality of the writing, and in the writing alone. Brick Lane fails on this most crucial level. The novel lacks any complexity or development. Initially, I was curious to read about the Bangladeshi immigrant experience because the subject matter is relatively new to South Asian immigrant writing. I was sorely disappointed, and at times repelled by the narrative. <br />Clearly, Monica Ali doesn't have a clue about the real Bangladesh. I have to question whether she's ever traveled there. Her portrayals of the country are relegated to a strange rolling green idyllic village, and a non-visual, drab depiction of urban Dhaka. We thirst for more connection to the point of origin, but the author leaves us high and dry. Nazneen's home, which would explain so much of her supposed angst and identity issues, is hidden or rather inaccurately described by the author. <br />Could a story be any more boring and stereotypical? Nazneen is married off to repugnant Chanu, who is significantly older than her, and consequently trapped in a loveless marriage transported to Brick Lane in London. She flits around her low income flat with grease stained sofas in a stupor, gives birth to two girls, and then begins an affair with the classic lover. A young, interested in all things Islam, muscular, tailor's nephew Karim. For goodness sakes, is this a Bangladeshi Bollywood film script? The film would at least have a song and dance routine to relieve the sheer predictability and repetitive boredom. <br />I was so put off by Ali's constant descriptions of Chanu stroking his pot belly, droning on patriotic themes, and comparing his homeland to the evils of England and the English, that I wanted to gloss over those paragraphs. I kept looking at the page numbers to see how much more I would have to endure. <br />A big portion of the book is devoted to the strange letters Nazneen receives from her sister in Bangladesh. It's best if I don't go into the sister's life because it is completely ludicrous, even vaudevillian dumb, prostitution and the lot, you get the idea. Back to the letters, the sister writes in broken, 'Banglafied' English that makes absolutely no stylistic or thematic sense. Is she writing in English? This can't be possible because Nazleen doesn't speak or write it either. So then why is her Bangla broken and in pigeon form, but then translated to doubly broken English?  Is she mentally challenged? Ali doesn't indicate this at any point. If this is some attempt to be innovative in the novelistic form, Ali desperately needs an editor and many creative writing classes because it ain't working.<br />Brick Lane is a book by a first time author that is riding on the 'all things South Asian are hip wave.' I hope that readers don't take this to be representative of an experience of an immigrant family from the subcontinent living in the West. Hype at it's worst. Don't waste your mind space on this book.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Philip Noyce has transformed an epic journey into an example of visual poetry.  Three girls, kidnapped and destined for &quot;assimilation&quot; into white Australian society, escape their &quot;protectors&quot;.  In an astonishing journey, pursued by government police and an Aborigine tracker, they evade authority's clutches.  After seven weeks and eighteen hundred kilometres journey, they reach home.  Perhaps the longest foot journey in Australia.<br />Noyce beautifully captures the harsh environment traversed by the trio, even though the filming was far distant from the actual location.  The girls must use every available cover and device to escape capture, and Noyce maintains the tension throughout the film.  Using numerous close-ups to convey feeling, you're kept aware that flight from captivity isn't a social event.  Encounters with either white or fellow Aborigines force reserve, suspicion and hesitation - talk is minimised, even among the three escapees.  This is a highly visual film in a setting providing oppotunities for lush images.<br />It is the people, however, that give this film its true grandeur.  Clearly, the fleeing girls aren't professionals before the camera.  Everlyn Sampi's facial expressions seize the soul in nearly every scene.  She's aware of the burden she's carrying, leading the escape, keeping them free, thwarting detection and pursuit, finding the track.  David Gulpilil, the Aborigine tracker, also rivets the eye as he leads the quest to return the girls to the mission.  How does he feel in pursuit of his own kind in the employ of the dominant, racist, white society?  Kenneth Branagh might have absorbed the soul of A.O. Neville so graphically does he portray the &quot;Protector of Aborigines&quot;.  Called &quot;The Devil&quot; by Aborigines and seeming to personify all the worst aspects of a racist society, Neville was simply an extreme example of his society's mores.  Branagh clearly understands this fully, playing the role with marvelous reserve.<br /><br />This DVD is almost a novelty for other aspects.  The discriminating viewer will soon discover that the &quot;Special Features&quot; aren't something to by-pass lightly.  Instead of the usual long-winded interviews with directors, producers and actors, Noyce, with his usual skill offers something truly captivating.  He takes you on a &quot;hand-held camera&quot; journey to solicit the acting team from remote Australian communities.  We are introduced to the various children discovered, assessed and chosen for the roles.  These are but children suddenly confronted with a new world.  Their reactions are poignant and inspiring.<br /><br />Finally, the viewer will discover yet another level of reward in watching the film again with the voice-over commentary enabled.  Fresh surprises await the patient as Noyce discusses how the film came to him and his enthusiasm for it.  He relates his dealings with all the cast.  It is David Gulpilil who, with infinite subtlety, transforms the book's tracker into a wholly new and realistic character.  Every praise that can be imparted to the three children suddenly becomes remote as you discover Gulpilil manifests the two centuries of Aborigine-white encounters.  Buy this film in anticipation of many unexpected revelations. [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada]lous reserve. <BR>  <br />This DVD is almost a novelty for other aspects.

B00018D44U|5.0|With her sophomore album, Norah Jones has decided not to stray too far form her proven formula, but the new album improves on a few of the pitfalls of \\"Come Away With Me\\": There are a few more up-tempo numbers (and more variety)  on this collection and, while the previous album was mostly jazz with a tinge of country, this new CD is pretty much a country record with a tinge of jazz. <br />With that said, this CD works much better than Jones' previous effort. It's more fluid and captivating, and her singing is more expressive and tender. Also, the instrumentation is a bit more daring, and the songs have a lot more meat on the bones. Choice cuts include \\"Toes,\\" \\"Be Here To Love Me\\" and \\"What Am I To You.\\" <br />Although this album contains a misguided, odd-duck duet with Dolly Parton on \\"Creepin' In,\\" it is still a luxurious, gorgeous collection that is certain to please most Norah Jones fans.
B000068CNX|5.0|The FRIENDS have done it again! They're back in Season Two with even more surprises!!! The season starts off with \\"The One With Ross' New Girlfriend\\", which sadly, isn't Rachel. It picks up as in last season, where Rachel was going to the airport to meet Ross after his trip from China, to tell him of her feelings, which was something ROSS shouldda done LAST season!<br />Anyway, Ross comes home with Julie, an old college friend in charge of the dinosaur dig in China, which leaves Rachel in a pissed-off-awe.<br />In season two, more deep secerts are revealed on Ross and Rachel's past, we find out Phoebe has a husband, perfect Monica gets fired from her job, Joey drinks breast milk, Chandler gets a new roomie, and many more other events occur in The Compete Second Season of Friends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I have been a Maiden fan since 1982.<br />That being said, I believe this is Maiden's best effort since 1986's 'Somewhere In Time'. The singing is better than on any recent maiden disc that I can think of now. And although I liked 'Brave New World', &quot;Brave&quot; kind of sucks when compared to 'Dance of Death'.<br />This album sees Iron Maiden going toward a more &quot;progressive&quot; metal feel. There is more orchestration on this album and far better production/mixing on &quot;Dance of Death&quot; than that the previous Maiden album. Although, there is some hints to their previous works in songs such as 'Montsegeur' and 'Pachendale' (The best song on the album, I must say).<br />Moreover, this is a must have for any Maiden fan. Overall, it's a great CD. This CD has smooth flow to it. There is more continuty on 'Dance' than on their 90's discs or 'Brave New World'. <br />In short, it's a must have if you are into Iron Maiden.<BR>With 'Dance of Death' the band demonstrate, again, that they can make Metal for the Mind.
B0001AP12G|3.0|I would consider mydself a big Roc-A-Fella fan. But this album here is just not cutting it with me. Kanye West has the potential to be a big artist, personally I think he may have tried to hard on making his debut big. Because to be honest I was not all that impressed. Maybe I need to listen to it a couple more times before it settles....
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a great cd. BUT!!<br />All the Beatles regular albums are so good that this greatest hits isn't even as good as one of them. Go buy Abbey Road, The White Album, Revolver, Rubber Soul, heck, any of them, instead.<br />Again, it's great, you can't go wrong with a Beatles greatest hits, but the solo albums are better.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I like the bizkit, but Significant and Starfish should've been combined into one album with all the crap left off.  You wanna know what I never liked about rap?  Rap albums have 2 trendy songs and the rest of the songs are filler - a bunch of cliches and songs about how tough the singer is.  In that regard, this is a true rap album.  Fred ruins perfectly good songs by singing stupid lyrics that you can't sing along with.  Yet I like this album enough that I still listen to it.  Go figure.  Oh, and what is this about 2 discs?  Did everyone else get 2 discs?  I am trying to find my case to see if I someone didn't notice it was a 2-disc set because I never noticed before.
B0001AP12G|4.0|For those that don't know, Kanye West has been making beets for Jay-Z since The Dynasty, he is by no means new to the game.  The only reason this album didn't get 5 stars was because he just needs to step up his lyricism a lil bit but once he does that nobody can complain.  He raps about real life situations but adds in a little humor to keep the commercial audience listening.  Yo here's a rundown:<br />Track 01-Skit<br />Track 02- (3.5/5) &quot;...can't shine off $6.55&quot; we all know about minimum     wage.  Hot beat. Good chorus.  Funny lyrics.<br />Track 03-Fill In. Don't tell anybody.<br />Track 04- (4/5) Originally a poem he recited on Def Poetry.  He turned it into a flow and had Lauren Hill on the chorus.  Unstated problems didn't allow her to make the final cut.<br />Track 05- Another fill in.  One for church or somethin.<br />Track 06- (3.5/5) Spoke for everybody that has ever worked retail in their lives tryin to save up to live their dreams. Didn't really like the cameos though.<br />Track 07-(3/5) One of the first songs he spit on his demo when he was trying to get signed.  Good to listen to when your back is against the wall.<br />Track 08- (5/5) &quot;Oh Baby.&quot; This beat is foolish.  Already a classic.  Kanye's lyrics actually outshines jiggas here, &quot;racism still alive they just be concealin it&quot;, and &quot;I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye/ cuz look what a accident did to Left Eye/ first Aaliyah now Romeo must die?&quot; So positive. Jay kills it too.<br />Track 09- (4.5/5) Who said Kanye ain't got flows?  Just listen to the first few bars.  Then guess who's on the track Talib Kweli and Common Sense.  Remeber what Jay said on the Black Album.  Kanye was smart to have both of them on the same track.<br />Track 10- Skit. &quot;Six-pac Shakur&quot; WHAT? &quot;$Free.99?&quot;<br />Track 11- (4.5/5) Watch this be the next club banger. Lyrics are definitely silly on this one.  Beat is wild.  I wonder if he could do a beat for me one day. &quot;maybe we could work it out.&quot;<br />Track 12- (3.5/5) Second single.  A little different from the one thats getting radio play.  Only one verse from twista and more singing from Jamie Foxx.<br />Track 13-(3/5) One thing I can say about Kanye's beats is that they are versitile.  North, South, East, West, he can do it all.  Chorus is funny.<br />Track 14-Skit. &quot;Oh my god&quot;<br />Track 15- (3.5/5) I'm in college right now so you know we be bumpin dis up in da Omega house.  Different flow stlye from him.<br />Track 16-Skit.  This cat is hopeless.<br />Track 17-Skit.  Don't feel sorry for people like this.<br />Track 18- (5/5) Another classic.  Another classic beat.  Need I say more. Yes I do.  Mos Def is a rediculus man.  Freeway ended the song perfect.  Nothin wrong with this song at all.<br />Track 19- (5/5) This song should be motivation for everybody.  It almost feels like you knew him through all of this.  Through the whole wire.  Gotta love it.<br />Track 20- (4.5/5) My favorite song on the CD.  Only because it makes me smile everytime i hear it.  Makes anybody reminisce about their fam and back in the day.  Hits you on the inside.<br />Track 21- (4/5) This song is like 12 minutes long but most of it is talking about how he got signed. You only need to listen to this song about one time if you didn't know who he was and where he's coming from.<br />He had a couple of songs he had to take off of the album and add to the bonus CD's like &quot;My Way&quot; which is another one of my favorites, and &quot; The Good, Bad, Ugly.&quot;  So stop downloadin an go cop da real album.  Da Roc aint going nowhere.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is the newest and maybe most talented addition to Rocafella records.  He has been making beats for everyone lately, from Alicia Keys, Ludacris, and even Britney Spears.  The man is the new Neptunes, except where their beats were weird, his are beautiful.  He makes smooth beats that you can sit back and just bop to.  Its not music that makes u have spasms, its pretty.  It has soul and it has feeling, which i think is helped by the beautifully strewn samples from Mo-town hits and such.  His flow is pretty different.  He actually raps about things that matter.  Doesnt talk about shooting people or how many stores he held up.  He keeps it real to where he is at.  It reminds me of old school lyrics with new school beats, its a perfect union.  Get this album!!  Even if you have been disappointed with rap lately as i have been.  This man brings rap back to where it should be.
0553801546|5.0|I don't read a lot of fantasy these days, but somehow I picked up Robin Hobb one day and I'm extremely grateful.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say that this was a great book, and that it was just as satisfying as all the rest of her novels.  The only regret I have is that there are no more for me to read, and I can't find any other fantasy author that I like nearly as well.  <br />If you're new to Hobb, you shouldn't start with Fool's fate.   Begin with Assassin's apprentice and read the her other books first.  And if anyone knows of another author as good as Hobb, let me know!
B00018D44U|3.0|To say that Norah Jone's debut album 'Come Away With Me' was a breath of fresh air is an understatement.  The bluesy-jazz influenced debut was a masterpiece, with critics and fans both appreciating the flawless material.  Her deep, breathy & sultry voice is very sexy, even when she isn't singing about love or relationships. While there is nothing on 'Feels like Home' that can hold a candle to her incomprable debut set, its still more than likely to be one of the better releases in the near future.<br />Norah's voice is such an astounding instrument, that the need of background music is very minimal, which she knows by the fact her material is never overproduced.  But on the other hand, there is nothing here that sticks with you like the first time around. The only real standouts include \\"Sunrise\\", \\"What Am I To You\\" & \\"Be Here to Love Me\\".<br />I recommend getting her first record rather than purchasing this one. I knew that this record wasn't going to be better than the first, but I was expecting it to be better than it was.

B0001AP12G|3.0|Every once in a great while, a Kanye West comes along.  A rap artist that speaks on different issues rather then guns, drugs &amp; material possesions (for the most part) is enough in its own right, but West also cleverly creates music that is enjoyable, and sometimes that doesn't even feel like hip hop. &quot;Through the Wire&quot; is urban radio's sole shining star (with the exception of Outkast) regardless of whats topping the charts right now. This track is incredible, and with witty lyrics from Kanye &amp; a very wise choice in sample (Chaka Kahn's 'Through the Fire'), it has become an understated rap classic.<br />The beats are phenominal, some of the best we've heard in a while, and the best part is West has no problem flowing over them.  It even sounds second nature to him on one of the album's better tracks &quot;Get Em High&quot; with Talib Kweli. When it comes to producing, it seems he makes all the right decisions. All the samples fit the tracks perfect such as on &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (which samples 'Mystery of Inequity' by Lauryn Hill) &amp; &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; (which samples Luther Vandross' 'A House is not a Home').<br />Even lyrically, though mostly average, he is something worth talking about. Throughout the album he can be heard glorifying women for being who they are ('All falls Down') &amp; spits some really inspiring and uplifting rhymes ('Family Business'). &quot;I turned tragedy to triumph&quot; ('Through the Wire') is something that needs to be implanted in the minds of black america's troubled youth. This only makes my appreciation grow even more.<br />It's when West dares to be different that his College Dropout shines the brightest. If he steps his game up and leaves the few sterotypical rhymes on here behind, he WILL BE the dominate force in rap now that Jay-Z is ready to pass the torch. Do not take your eyes off this one for a second.
B0001AP12G|5.0|man you can say every song on this cd is tight. this dude is so original that he's gonna have people trying to do his style within the next year, but there will only be one kanye
B0001AP12G|3.0|Kayne West's debut album &quot;College Dropout&quot; (2004) is good but not deserving of all the hype it has received. Kayne West production skills have been excellent, so I was interested in seeing how his MC skills are. The problem I find when listening to him, is he is not a gifted MC, his lyrics are for the most part average, and the way he curls his words can at times be annoying. The high number of skits and filler don't help either. That said there are some highlights to this album, for me they are for the most part well chosen collaboration tracks like: &quot;All Fall's Down&quot; feat. Syleena Johnson, &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; feat. Jay-Z, &quot;Get Em High&quot; Feat. Talib Kweli/Common and the hit single &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; with Twista/Jamie Foxxx (which was already released on Twista's album). By teaming up with some of Rap's talented lyricists Kayne provides some memorable tracks. One track that Kayne does shine on solo is &quot;Family Business&quot; an outstanding cut- deep, introspective, real and uplifting. Kayne comes off best on tracks like that , because he is providing something different, more then the typical cut you here today.  <BR>End of day this is an album worth checking out if your a Rocafella fan, from Chicago or just looking for some fresh music. 3.5.
B000021YQV|5.0|This album was the first I ever heard of System Of a Down and I was immediatley hooked, if you havn't heared it then you should buy it and listen to it. The best songs are: Chop suey, Bouce and Aerials. Basically they're great everybody will love them!
B00006RU5B|2.0|When I heard these guys were getting together I was excited. The guys from Rage getting together with Chris Cornell, it couldn't any better than that right? Wrong. When I first heard Cochise all the excitment that built up inside of me prior to the release of this album immediatly dissapeared. The guitar riff sounds like a half assed Rage riff and the vocals aren't that good. I couldn't get into this song at all. I knew Audioslave wasn't going to be Rage Against the Machine, but I thought it would be a lot better than what it is. Rage's music was filled with anger, emotion, powerful lyrics, earth shaking bass lines and drum beats, and brilliant guitar riffs. Audioslave is just flat out boring. Like a Stone is a perfect example of an extremely boring song. Everyone thinks these guys are gonna &quot;save rock&quot;, but I just think they're overrated and boring.
B0001AP12G|5.0|LETS BE REAL. Jay-z retired and roc-a-fella have to leave it in hands of somebody who can put something together. This cd is hot. One where you can listen to it without skipping tunes. I think &quot;through the wire&quot; is not the best song on this cd &quot;get em high&quot; and &quot;never let me down&quot; them two song. are sweet. Lyrically and beat wise. Enough said buy this cd. its gonna be the hottest album out for a while.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|\\"I'm not that innocent!\\" is what Britney proclaimed on her number one single, \\"Oops!\\" back in 2000, and indeed she is right. In The Zone is completely bereft of the bubblegum pop that shot Brit to fame, and has been replaced with a CD full of more dancey clubbing tunes, with Britney crooning along seductively. With the girl next door image thrown straight out of the window, Britney is now singing about shaking her ass 'til the early morning, her sex drive and shopping spree, and enjoying a night of passion in the erotic \\"Breathe On Me\\". But is all of this any good?<br />1. <<Me Against The Music>> Dueting with Madonna, this is the first single to be taken from the album. Good upbeat anthem, with a nice contribution from Madonna. Nothing really special though. 6/10<br />2. <<(I Got That) Boom Boom>> Now featuring the Ying Yang twins, this has a cool tribal beat and an uplifting, catchy chorus. The contribution from the twins gets repetitive though. 7/10<br />3. <<Showdown>> One of my favourites from the CD, breaks into a really cool dancey part after the first couple of minutes and has a great ending. 8/10<br />4. <<Breathe On Me>> Excellent track here, best on the album easily. Britney sings in her most sultry, sexy and seductive voice along to a cool electro pop beat to envy those of Kylie. 9/10<br />5. <<Early Morning>> This track was penned by Moby, and whereas it isn't bad, it suffers from the lack of a killer chrous, and I would of expected more considering who Brit was working with. Pretty dull stuff. 5/10<br />6. <<Toxic>> Another great track, as Spears plays around with her voice a bit, and the bit before the final chrous where her voice goes all high is cool. 8/10<br />7. <<Outrageous>> Poor track here, produced by R Kelly, this has a irritating and repetitive chorus and doesn't really go anywhere. 4/10<br />8. <<Touch Of My Hand>> Yes, this is about you know what. Decent, passable material but nothing outstanding. 7/10<br />9. <<The Hook Up>> Good tune, with a reggae vibe to it. Sounds very similar to Round Up by Blu Cantrell. 8/10<br />10. <<Shadow>> Yawn, the flow is broken with a gloopy ballad. Again, passable, but nothing exciting. 6/10<br />11. <<Brave New Girl>> This is about as close to bubblegum pop as the album gets. Very cheesy, but a nice chorus keeps things going along smoothly. 8/10<br />12. <<Everytime>> The second of the two ballads on the CD, and the more lacklustre of the two. Brit should definately kept to the clubbing theme all the way through this album. 3/10<br />13. <<Me Against The Music (Remix>> Absolutely horrendous remix, the album REALLY did not need this. Meh. 2/10<br />So that brings us to the end. Britney has definately took a step forward by dumping the cheesy pop sound and going more dance, as this album is pretty solid for the most part, and offers a fresh, new sound. \\"Showdown\\" is a cool poppy dance anthem, \\"Toxic\\" is a superb slice of unique pop, and the electro pop beats of \\"Breathe On Me\\" and \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" are far more alluring than the slopfests of \\"Everytime\\" and \\"Shadow\\". Overall its a a good collection of clubbing tunes that shows Britney still can pull out the decent music.<br />Overall >> 7/10
0156027321|4.0|With &quot;Life of Pi,&quot; Martel does a nice job of creating characters that drive the story, rather than vice-versa.  If you're tired of plot-driven novels with thin, and often cliché, characters, then you're likely to dig this one. <br />If you're into writers like Yann Martel, Sue Monk Kidd, Dan Brown, etc., then there's a new writer you should check out: GREG IPPOLITO.  His most recent novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is a politically charged page-turner that pits its main Gen X character (John Saylor) against his Baby Boomer parents, teachers, etc., during the winter of 1991 -- during the heart of the Persian Gulf War.  Right now, Ippolito is still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read.  You can check him out and read an excerpt at:<br />[...]<br />Don't miss it.

B00005QXXO|3.0|I personally like Thom's voice live only you actually need to see them live to get the feeling. Also True Love Waits isn't a love song its about during the time the Christian chruch sent out messages to not let kids lose their virginity when they're not married the chruch made the slogan \\"True Love Waits\\" Get it?
B00006RG9K|5.0|Genesis has remained a group, in the most accurate definition of the word. Their unique history together and interesting story-songs, place Genesis into a world all their own, never to be equaled again. It's too bad they are officially no longer together. This concert (like previous Genesis shows) is awesome. Genesis has always put on &quot;true&quot; shows for the audience's entertainment.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|Previous reviewers all seemed to hate or love this film.  I can sum it up by saying that those who loved it are probably impressed by a human interest / dialogue film with a wonderful premise, and those who hated it probably wanted more characterization and plot.<br />It is obvious that Sofia Coppola is shallow while surrounded by  richesse.  The female lead may be smart, but she only appears deep.  The character she seems to be would never have gone to those superficial parties.  Nothing she ever says shows any depth at all.  The fact that she is not as over-the-top idiotic as her husband's movie star friend does not make her wise.  The actress looked very pretty but did not have to do any difficult acting.<br />Neither did the marvelous Bill Murray.  Yes, I'd probably watch him read the phone book.  Yes, he captured PERFECTLY the spirit of ennui and frustration that his character called for.  I don't mind him winning awards for his job, but I don't think this role was his hardest work, either, if you know what I mean.<br />Tokyo was also shallowly characterized, as though she were just another superficial Coppola personage.  <br />The best part of the movie for me was the relationship between the two of them.  I wish they hadn't been married, though, because it was not their marriages that determined the outcome.  It seemed very familiar, and I identified with her greatly.  There are a lot of reasons why 20-somethings and 50-somethings don't make for a long-term match, and the movie pointed these out.  Different stages of life attract as do opposites, though, and it makes for a good story.<br />I recommend watching this film without expecting to be blown away by anything about it.
B00008977N|4.0|Peter Gabriel certainly challenges the traditional realms of music today and this concert reveals his creativity. A very unique stage and show concept in use, as Pete does best. This is a cool live performance to have in your collection. Although not the best effort placed in video quality, the content and enthusiasm of the musicians carries the concert through.
B0000B3FCX|2.0|This is an okay cd, but it is somewhat boring, and repeats itself, if u want a good nickleback cd, buy there first one or buy linkinpark or something, dont waste ur money.
B00005JM0B|1.0|The movie is so cheezeee.... the action is so phony, the guy who plays John Conner sucks, in T2 the kid was cool in this one he's a big dork. So much money put into this crappy movie, it's a one big joke if you a ask me. Whatever ever happend to the cop that pulled over the evil robot chick, all the sudden they decided not to show that part. The huge truck was alreayd parked next to the animal hospital to be driven on little street and destory everything in it's way...oh please.... <BR>THE MOVIE PLAIN SUCKS...T2 is still the best Terminator MOVIE. period
B00006FDCD|1.0|...one of the most rediculously awful film adaptations i have ever seen. this is seriously a HUGE letdown for someone who has read the entire 1000+ book. either a memorable seen from the book was ruined in careless acting, or they just left a scene out all together. many of the characters you grew to love in the book aren't interesting here. Stephen King describes them to the point that you FEEL and UNDERSTAND there emotions. the movie desplays them as boring kids you couldn't give a crap about.<br />the worst part by far was what they did to It. the book portrays the beast as something very desgusting and evil in graphic detail. the movie uses it as Pennywise the Clown 85% of the time, and you feel like laghing more than shivering. plus, they kill It after a fight that seems to last a matter of seconds. in the book, the fight is incredibly long, and SO MANY differant things happen(if i told you it would spoil the story).<br />anyways, maybe i am a bit harsh on this movie, but people like me who have been huge fans of this story, and find that it is put in such crap like this can't help but feel terribly upset.<br />  1/10
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I have only good things to say about this film. It is superb. My only problem is, since watching it, I cannot stop thinking about Scarlett Johansson. Bill Murray is his usual brilliant self, but for me Johansson stole the movie. And thank God for no predictable hollywood ending. I was always skeptical that Sophia Coppola was just riding her father's coattails, but she more than proved herself with this film. This is one to own, not rent.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I can sum up the entire movie in one word &quot;disappointing.&quot; I was so excited about seeing another Bill Murray movie, and rented the DVD the day it came out. I really can't think of a slower movie that seemed to lead me nowhere. And it took what seemed like an eternity to get there. As much as I want to like this movie, I must say &quot;STAY AWAY&quot;. Don't do it to yourself. Just read the comments from the guy who posted &quot;Lonely Days, Lonely Nights&quot;. That's all you need to know. You can thank me now.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is crazy, you must go out and buy it...Many people underestimated him...They were all wrong. The beats on this album are crazy all of them are HOT. Kanye's flow is diffrent from many others, in a good way. Go buy the album. Buy 5 copies each. This is a CD were you can listen to the WHOLE thing non-stop. No need for skipping. Most Anticipated Debut Album of 2004...I see why
B00000IPAX|5.0|Hey I will admit i bought this album for one song, all the small things.  And it wasnet that bad i liked it.  It was catchy and the lyrics were cool.  As i kept listioning to it he song grew old so I took the chance of venturing out and listioning to the other songs. So there i was starting at the begining and i rolled right through it and to tell you the truth I LOVED IT!!  It was a totally killer cd.  It starts of with dumpweed which is catchy and gets you into the cd.  It has cool guitar rifts and travis does a nice job on the drums. Second is Don't leave me which i also liked.  It was almost funny at times.  It does not have as cool of rifts as other tracks do but it makes up with lyrics.  They were great lyrics. Next is Alians Exist.  Tom sings this song and his voice is perfect for the song. Travis does a nice job on the drums and once agian the guitar and bass rifts are good.  During the chorus they sing in harmony and that sounds really good. Whats my age agian is next and that is the second track i really got into. Great guitar rifts and good song writing but the song gets a little old after a while. Next is Going away to college.  Great rythom guitar and good chorus.  I liked this song. Next is Dysentary Gary which is a very funny track.  I thought the drums where the best in this cd and the main guiter was perfect.  It also had cacthy lyrics, great great track.  All the small things was next which was good but it got a little old after a while.  Not just a spactular job on anything but they pieced it together and it sounded alright. then their is Adoms song which is a sad song.  There is a piano in their and it was a nice change of pace.  Also the lyrics were very moving. Next was the Party song which the lyrics were great and the drums were good.  they worked the base in to and that sounded good.  Then there was Mutt which had a good rythem guitar and pretty good lyrics but not one of there best but it passes. Wendy Clear came and it also had some niecebase action and the lyrics were just ok.  But still not a bad song they seemed to ryem a lot. Last is the Anthem which has great guitar and great drums nice closing song.  And that is the album.  It is a little punk and a little pop so i know that will turn some fans off but i still think this album is AWSOME!!! I will stop writing now!
B00009V7T2|2.0|If you like &quot;Rush&quot; and &quot;At the Drive In&quot; then you'll love this album.  However - if you do not like those bands, as I do not, well this album just plain sucks.  I mean really you might as well go listen to a gig by your local high school Jazz band.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The first time you realized that love was more than infatuation...  Your first kiss...  The alienation and emptiness of wasted love...<BR>Life is full of epiphanies and moments that become mythical and hyperbolized in frequent memory replay.  These moments are factors of time and they pass persistently, and we are powerless to recapture them.  No movie in recent memory captures the reality of the passing moment and the alienation of a fish out of its proverbial cultural water better than Lost in Translation.<BR>Each scene is like a living polaroid in a vacation album, each only making sense in context with the memories that accompany them.  While a relationship is the focal point, both people remain individual, alienated, but connected.  This is the beauty of this movie, it's ablility to realistically portray the honesty of human feelings within a dream-like setting of a very real location, Tokyo.  Tokyo itself becomes a character in this movie as Bob (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) interact with the city, observe it, are dwarfed by its size, and are mesmerized by its oddities.  <BR>Sofia Coppola has crafted a script that passes like a ribbon in the breeze, moving in and out of conversations and moments, catching them in their candid happenings.  Scenes capture the lonely minutes and hours of the insomniac, the awkwardness of an abrupt introduction, the uncomfortability of a confrontation, all with the vague sense that, while this seems to be so dream-like, you are catching these moments in their raw honesty.  All of these individual moments string together into a story of feeling, rather than happening, being, rather than doing.<BR>Coppola's work as Director is flawless, and the movie was perfectly cast in all of the parts, from Bill Murray as the washed-up actor and Scarlett Johansson as the soul-searching twentysomething, to the ensemble of Japanese, American, and other faces that enter into their world.  Murray resists the temptation to use hispast work as a primer for the role, and instead, he takes us to depths of complexity that use his familiarity to the audience as well as his unique portrayal of an uncommon role to bring the audience into the experience of the character Bob Harris.<BR>This movie can make you think of those unlikely memories that you rarely visit, and it takes the audience into the depths of a relationship that is so human in its complexity and so identifyable in its innocence.  Plus the soundtrack perfectly captures the feelings that the director attempts to ossify in the audience's memory.<BR>That said, this movie isn't for everyone.  It blatantly bucks the traditional hollywood-type characterizations, and is therefore much more thorough, however slow, in building the characters around which the entire story revolves.  This could lose the interest of some viewers more accustomed to a typical popcorn flick, as well as viewers expecting a typical Bill Murray comedy.  It is actually somewhat of a disservice to the audience that this film was marketed as a comedy, since much of the humor is very subtle, and the movie overall does not seem like a vehicle for humor.  Humor is just one sarcastic lens through which Bill Murray's character processes his journey through this foreign world.<BR>This movie contains scenes, such as the scene in the karaoke booth, which I believe will remain in the conscience of American cinema for a long time.  For this and all the above reasons, I highly recommend this movie for everyone who has felt like an outsider or had a whirlwind relationship that was greater for its brevity than it ever would have been at length.
B00009V7RF|1.0|This has to be the single-most horrible accident on the face of the earth.  The worst part of this &quot;band&quot; of &quot;musicians&quot; gaining success has to be the people actually buying the CD.  What are you thinking?  Yes you!  Terrible!  I wouldn't torture Iraqi soldiers with this &quot;music&quot;.  1 out of 5, only because there's no decimal points.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The first Thing comes to people minds reading these reviews is ( should i seek watching this movie ..should i buy it ? ).........<BR>well, the answer here is YES<BR>Kill Bill is one of the best action movies appeared in the last couple of years ..i guarantee that.<BR>Kill Bill's plot is kind of old story ( a woman takes revenge from all those tried to kill her ) , BUT director, Quantan Tarantino proves that a skilled director is able to produce an ordinary consumed story with a total new vision and rhythm ..!!<BR>the movie is inspired by the action movies of the 70s period , asian action movies and Manga ( japanese comic books )..and that appears vividly in every single detail with in the movie.<BR>much effort is done in this movie , so u'd see Excellent Action , Excellent Acting, Excellent Music and Sound Effects and Excellent Visual Effects.<BR>THe Director Quantin Tarantino Used his Tools very well , and such a unique , New way..<BR>THe way the time sequence is used is very impressing..he didn't put every thing in order..actually he did put some recent events before the later ones...putting them in order of the events of Less Importance To these of more Importance.<BR>Music and sound effects are perfect ...the use of music is so good, music here gives more dimensions to the events..not just a background parallel to the picture..here they mingle together..(there's a very nice fight with swords with a music of a spanish dance ).<BR>Acting ...since the movie is full of action much more than conversations, the actors made great effort to appeal their feelings by eye contact and physical movements..well they did it very well, specialy Lucy Liu ( You'll see her in kill bill as u never seen her before )..and of course Uma Thurman.<BR>my last comments :<BR> - the movie have lot of Blood and offending scenes ..so if you  are offended and disturbed by such scenes ..don't watch this  movie.<BR> - Kill Bill vol 1 is such a big TEASER ..you will wait            impatiently for Kill Bill vol 2 ...<BR> - i wonder why this movie wasn't nominated for any Oscars...can    any body tell me ?
B00013F38K|5.0|everybody must buy the dvd's, unlike what people are saying you will not loose any of the picture, in fact you will enhance some through widescreen anamorphic format, wich is in the description or details of the dvd's. If you know anything about widesceen there will be know loss of picture on these dvd's, and just because there are black bars on the top and bottom of the picture doesnt mean they cut the picture. It is anamorphic, 100% original, plus a remastered picture makes this series of dvd's so much better than it was in it's original broadcast.

B00008PW2D|3.0|I did enjoy this season, as I do with every season of Sex and the City.  I don't think season 5 was a throw-away season.  Although I do hesitate to spend this much on only 8 episodes.  Granted - they are a great 8 episodes.  But so are the other episodes where I get 18ish episodes for the same price.<br />I think I'll wait for season 6 to come out and see if this price goes down.  I'm just not willing to spend that much money on such little product.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Collge Dropout is one the best hip hop albums I've ever heard.  The beats and the lyrics come at you like train.  Taking the listener on a ride of musical ectasy.  Also the guest appearances on the make a great album even better.  A album like this should be picked up by everyone.  *HIGHLY RECOMMENDED*

B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a bunch of GOOFS at FOX for letting this one die on the vine. It never ceases to amaze me how big companies like this make such huge mistakes, like this. All I can say to FOX is restart Firefly; get all the actors back that you can and get it going again.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I saw this movie in theatres. Loved it. Dvd followed shortly after with a less than thrilling audio/extras list. The movie itself is brilliant, set against the backdrop of modern day japan, adding mystique to the whole experience. I read a review on amazon.com by some idiot stating that the movie would have had better results, had it been set in america. Did you completely miss the point of the movie? 1/2 the intrigue and dialogue was regaurding how out of place they were to the rest of the country. People who hated this movie are the same types who hate movies like Kill Bill and 25th Hour. I personally found it to be the most enjoyable cinematic experiences I've had in years. Bill Murray DESERVES an oscar for all of his hard work as an actor (throughout the years), and this should take best picture, not LOTR:Rok.
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones has the unenviable task of following up a smash debut album, Come Away With Me, that hit number one (and still is in the top twenty-five after almost two years on the charts), sold eight million copies and won the big three at the Grammys, Record, Album &amp; Song of the year.  With her new release, Feels Like Home, Ms. Jones doesn't stray too far from the formula of her first album.  Feels Like Home also mixes jazz, country, folk and blues, but Ms. Jones sounds more confident and mature.  The song that really shows this off is &quot;What Am I To You?&quot;, which is her only solo composition on the album.  The song has a riff that grabs you right away and Ms. Jones applies a breathy vocal that rises as she reaches the chorus.  She dives into 70's singer-songwriter terrain on &quot;Toes&quot; &amp; &quot;Carnival Town&quot; that recall another woman with the same last name, Rickie Lee Jones. Ms. Jones gets Dolly Parton to provide guest vocals on &quot;Creepin' In&quot; which gets into bluegrass territory.  The album closes out with &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; which is Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot; that Ms. Jones added lyrics.  Feels Like Home will probably not match the commercial success of its predecessor, but it shows that Ms. Jones is growing as a truly distictive artist who feels at home in various and distinct musical styles.
B0000020C4|5.0|The fourth of four major (English) recordings.  A concert taped live; very dynamic atmosphere.  Includes special numbers.  Outstanding performances from the musical's top role-players.  Get this along with the Complete Symphonic Recording for a 'complete' experience!
B00005JM02|5.0|Any parent of a young child knows, that inevitably their child will latch on to some film or TV program and insist on seeing it oh say... three hundred times a week (O.K., I might be exaggerating a bit...but just a little, bit)! In my case I have been very lucky, because my two year old toddler has become enamored beyond belief with the Pixar animated film, &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;. I say &quot;lucky&quot; because if I'm going to sit down and view one disc hundreds of times on the old DVD player, then it might as well be something that's beautifully artistic, well written, imaginatively directed and featuring some of the best comedians and charactor actors in Hollywood as well as the international acting community. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if your age 2 or 102 your going to enjoy this movie. For anyone who's been hiding in an enime since the film's 2003 theatrical release it is an underwater story of a timid, over protective, widowed, clown fish named Marlin (neurotically played by Albert Brooks), who goes on an adventurous/comedic journey with a absent-minded, blue tang (hilariously played by Ellen DeGeneres) in search of his only son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has been stolen from the coral reef, apon which they live. Meanwhile, Nemo is trapped in an Australian, Dentist's office fish tank. He and the other aquatic inhabitants of the tank (including the voices of William DeFoe, Brad Garrett and Allison Janney) are attempting various plots to escape (a'la Steve McQueen's &quot;The Great Escape&quot;) and get back to the ocean (&quot;All drains lead to the Ocean&quot;).Along the way, the film imparts the ideal that although we still have to be protective &amp; vigilante of our children, we also have to let go, just a little bit, to let them experience, what life has to offer. Where do you start with what makes this film great? Do we start with the brilliant, computer animation? This is just a visually beautiful film to watch. It is like a painting in motion.You could turn the sound off and just serenely watch the changes in light and shadows throughout the film. It really seems like you are watching something under the sea. How about the great script? As, mentioned before, I have watched this movie many times and have yet to tire of the plot, well rounded characters or fast and funny dialogue.It's fun to try and pick up the pop cultural references made in the script (a shark named Bruce for all the &quot;Jaws&quot; fans out there). It seems like every time I watch this film, I discover something new in the script that gives me a chuckle. Also the casting in this film is just perfect! It's unbelievable how much comedic chemistry, actors, Albert Brooks and Ellen Degenres have together. You could close your eyes and listen to these two banter back and forth and it would still be thouroughly entertaining. Kudos also for all the actors, who do the voices for the fish in the tank. I love the gravity in actor, William DeFoe's line readings as Gil, the angel fish, who acts as ring leader for the bunch. Brad Garrett (of &quot;Everyone Loves Raymond&quot; fame)is equally good as a comically, deep voiced, blow fish. Finally, I want to mention Composer, Thomas Newman's wonderful musical score, that adds so much to the story and it's emotional impact.It leaves a lump in my throat everytime I hear it! I truely believe this film will historically go on to become an animated movie classic in the same way that &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Pinnochio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; have. This is great film that belongs in any DVD collection. Highly recommended for viewers young and old alike!motion.You could turn the sound off and just serenely watch the changes in light and shadows throughout the film.

B00000IMTF|5.0|I am a Led Zeppelin lover.  That aside, I , like most people, have other bands that I keep close to my heart.  One of them is Rainbow.  When I first heard of the the band it was in a guitar mag about Euro-Metal. I had heard a bit about Deep Purple, but, I didn't know that Blackmore had another 70's metal band.  The name didn't exactly fit with my vision of hard rock metal.  My mood quickly changed when I found out they had Dio fronting the early years.<BR>  This line up and album should stand as one of the all-time greats.  Only two people were carried over from the debut album. Blackmore struck gold with Bain and Cozy Powell( who I think is the greatest drummer ever) giving him a brick wall of crushing drums and bass.<BR>  This album carries very Deep Purple sounding songs. But, with one exception. These are ten times as better.  &quot;Stargazer&quot; is one of my all time favorites. Sure it's a Zeppelin rip-off, however, the harmonies, double kick drum, and Dio's tenor-esque voice stirs up passion in you when you hear it.<BR>  The other is &quot;Tarot Woman&quot;. This track is the lesser known and should have been on the the Very Best Of Rainbow.  The old 70's keyboards never sounded cooler.  That and the song reminds me of an old friend.<BR>  From an enginering stand point this is one of the clearest sounding old school cd's out there.  Too bad other classics like Blizzard of Ozz and Machine Head couldn't match it.  <BR> This is a must for drummers. If you don't know who Cozy Powell is . . . you need to wise up.  And bow down to his glory.  Dare I say it, but, he out does John Bonham's sound from Zeppelin IV's &quot;When The Levee Breaks&quot;.  There I said it.<BR> Final word: Get this f*cking album!  You'll be happier.  <BR> Also get one of the best live albums too.  Rainbow On Stage.
B000065BPB|5.0|I bought these phones partially based on the good user reviews at Amazon.com. I have used them since December, 2003 and they have not dissapointed. I use them mainly for pleasure, gaming, and critical listening. I've listened to jazz, classical, folk, hiphop, the blues, and everything else and these 280s hold their own. Great price and great sound. You won't feel like you're missing out anymore, I know I don't. The only thing I might mention is that, like others have said, these phones grip your head fairly well. I have a small head, so I just loosen them up a little and they're fine. If you must have really light headphones, I suggest the Senn HD 570s or something in that category, although they're a different type of phone. I've worn the 570s and one could easily forget they were wearing them. :) Tschuss.
B00005MAM2|5.0|spent $30 on this dvd at a media play several years back on nothing but word-of-mouth, and i have never regreted that descision. the ultimate triumph of Akira was that it, unlike certain other anime's *cough*X*coughcough*Ghost in the Shell*cough*, was not crammed full of every detail from the comic, leaving no time for character development. instead they simply took the first third of the comic, changed the ending, and relegated characters who play major roles in latter issues to cameos. you can see this with the afro woman (cant remember her name) and with Joker. Otomo edited down the story until it made a great movie that can stand on its own without the comic. absolute brilliance.

B0000A1RJI|4.0|An other special work of the new composer Klaus Badelt that takes the style of different famous composers, expecially the style of Hans Zimmer. The soundtrack is complete of Action music with the necessary tension and power and the romantic music. this score is good and gives us the idea that klaus is evolving. An other excellent work of Badelt is the Time Machine.<BR>Pirates of Caribbean the example of a good work for a new composer.
B000002H4Q|5.0|Anyone who dismisses this album as pure pop isn't actually listening.<br />The album opens with &quot;The Kiss&quot;, which after a somewhat lengthy musical intro features lyrics like &quot;Get your [expletive] voice out of my head... I wish you were dead.&quot; Which reminds me a lot more of Cure songs like &quot;Give Me It&quot; than their pop numbers.<br />Next comes &quot;Catch&quot;. It certainly sounds like a pop song, but as far as I can tell it's about a wistfully remembered epileptic.<br />Then &quot;Torture&quot;. &quot;My body is cut and broken/It's shattered and sore/My body is cut wide open/I can't stand anymore.&quot;<br />Then &quot;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&quot;, one of my favorite songs on the album. &quot;If only tonight we could fall/In a deathless spell... If only tonight we could slide/Into deep black water&quot;. Maybe not gloomy, but certainly goth.<br />&quot;Why Can't I Be You?&quot; OK, pure, wonderful, whimsical pop.<br />&quot;How Beautiful You Are&quot;. Probably my favorite. Again, pop presentation, but no more a love song than REM's &quot;The One I Love&quot;. Listen to the lyrics.<br />&quot;Snake Pit&quot;. &quot;And my eyes feel like they're bursting/And they're splitting like plums/And I'm writhing... in the snake pit&quot;.<br />&quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;. OK, pop. But &quot;Alone above a raging sea/That stole the only girl I loved/And drowned her deep inside of me.&quot;<br />&quot;All I Want&quot;. More pop than not.<BR>&quot;Hot Hot Hot!!!&quot; Awesome pop.<BR>&quot;One More Time&quot;. Pop.<BR>&quot;Like Cockatoos&quot;, &quot;Icing Sugar&quot;. Can't hear them in my head right now.<BR>&quot;The Perfect Girl&quot;. Pop.<BR>&quot;A Thousand Hours&quot;. More pop than not. But &quot;For how much longer can I howl into this wind?/For how much longer can I cry like this?&quot;<br />&quot;Shiver and Shake&quot;. &quot;You're just a babbling face/You're just three sick holes that run like sores.&quot;<br />&quot;Fight&quot;. &quot;The times it hurts when you cry/The times it hurts just to breathe.&quot;
B0001AP12G|5.0|I don't even know what to sya about this Cd. It is just that good.  There arent too many CDs that I listen to without skipping songs.  Every song on the CD is hott.  You  have to get this CD.
B00005Q66T|5.0|As a teenager in the 1980s, I absolutely loved Madonna; I refused to go a single day without listening to at least one Madonna song.  By the time the 1990s rolled around, the obsession had faded and, while I still liked Madonna, I really didn't keep up with her music (or pop music in general, the poor quality of which finally pushed me over to the oldies stations on my radio).  For me, GHV2 is a perfect match.  My previous exposure to most of these songs ranged from a little to none whatsoever, so I basically rediscovered Madonna when I bought this collection.  Madonna has never gotten the respect she deserves for her music; all I heard about her for many years were criticisms of her movies, jokes, etc.  Most of the critics seem to dismiss her music altogether, yet she unleashed some huge hits (not to mention impressive albums) during the 1990s, most of the best of which are included in this retrospective collection.  Now I know that Madonna is larger than life and that her music is really only a part of her persona.  Many people have disapproved of some of her antics over the years, including myself on occasion, but I have always loved and admired her strength, resolve, and undying commitment to be a complete individual and do whatever she wants to do.  It's easy to get lost in all the ephemeral nonsense that surrounds the woman, but her very foundation is her music, and this collection shows what an amazing performer she really is.<br />Madonna has been around quite a long time now, as hard as that is for me to believe.  The reason she is still turning out hits while many other artists from the early 80s are gone and forgotten comes down to her unmatched ability to completely recreate herself.  Not only does she adapt to changes in the musical scene, she leads the charge for change herself.  Over her career, this has allowed her to excel across a wide spectrum of song types.  I'm no dance music expert, but Madonna lays down the most infectious dance beats I know of in songs such as Deeper and Deeper (featuring a brilliant bridge into a part of her earlier song Vogue) and the totally funked up Music.  Beautiful Stranger is another great dance song (but I'll never be able to hear this song without conjuring up images from the music video featuring Austin Powers).  Of course, Madonna has her naughty side, as revealed in the edited versions of Erotica and - depending on your state of mind - Bedtime Stories.  Madonna never looks back or has regrets, a trait I greatly admire, and she makes this fact pretty clear in the sexually mischievous song Human Nature. What It Feels Like For a Girl makes the point even more convincingly as it points out the ways in which men and women are judged by different standards.<br />Madonna is also the voice behind some of the best love songs of the 1990s.  Classics such as The Power of Goodbye, Frozen, and Take a Bow are just beautiful, featuring some of the most moving choruses I've ever heard in pop music.  The lyrics, for those who stop to listen to them, are really quite poignant and touching - you won't find any bubble gum pop on GHV2.  Then there are the great songs I find hard to classify: Ray of Light is almost cosmic in its appeal and manic in its musical expression.  Drowned World/Substitute For Love carries a life-affirming beat in support of its unusually touching message.  Then there is Don't Tell Me, a song I like more and more each time I hear it.  I remember hearing it for the first time on the radio, as the deejay assured the audience that the \\"skips\\" we were about to hear in the early moments of the track were actually supposed to be there.  In the 1990s, Madonna was still taking chances, still taking music in new directions, and still turning out some of the best music in the business.  GHV2 is a great joy for Madonna fans and ample proof to all the disbelievers out there who deny this remarkable woman's musical talent.f in songs such as Deeper and Deeper (featuring a brilliant bridge into a part of her earlier song Vogue) and the totally funked up Music.

B00008S2VG|4.0|So here it is, 20 years on top of her game and The Queen of Pop presents us with American Life, her first album since the club-loving Music.<BR>At 1 and a half years, it's the longest amount of time Madonna's spent recording any album, and the anticipation of a masterpiece is smeared all over - especially after the last two albums.<br />The album kicks off with the genre-bending American Life. Not my favourite Madonna song ever, it still makes me giggle when I hear that rap...<BR>... still though, the acoustic chorus makes up for any &quot;mini-cooper/super dooper&quot; - 3/5<br />Hollywood picks up where Material Girl left off - old school Madge romp! Twanging guitars and a bumping beat provide one of the album's danceable highlights and ends with a bizarre contortion of Madonna crooning &quot;push the button, don't push the button!&quot; - 5/5<br />The next song, I'm So Stupid, was originally skipped repeatedly when i first bought the album, but I've since grown to enjoy it, even if the beginning voice affect had me running to throw my CD player out the window. Rock chick Madge, in the vein of the sublime Candy Perfume Girl from Ray Of Light, but without the organ... - 3/5<br />and swiftly onto the album's one real POP song - Love Profusion. This really is a sublime track, oozing 80s synth pop. The beat is destined to have you tapping and even if the lyrics are a bit naff, this is sheer joy on the ear! - 5/5<br />from the slightly naff to the, er, plain silly. Madge's ability to experiment were shown on Music's total break out track, Impressive Instant, but on Nobody Knows Me she's trying something different - minimalist techno. I'm unsure of what I think of this, I've heard some remixes and prefer them, but this version ain't too bad - 3/5<br />and from that, to *this*, Nothing Fails. It starts off with the same jittery guitar as Don't Tell Me but morphs into a gospel tinged masterpiece - think a slower, loved up Like A Prayer. This really should've been the first release off the album, and sadly due to the reaction to the first single/video, will be largely ignored. shame. - 5/5<br />the mid-tempo Intervention is in the same bracket as I'm So Stupid/Nobody Knows Me - I'll listen to it with the album, but not so special by itself - 2/5<br />and from a let-down to a delight, X-Static Process. A gorgeous acoustic love-song about, very possibly, Guy Ritchie, Madonna croons &quot;I always wished that I could find/someone as beautiful as you/but in the process I forgot/that I was special too&quot;, aw[...] - 5/5<br />and from acoustic to all out disco, Madonna even re-raps (!!) on this sad song about the death of her mother and how it affected her childhood, Mother And Father. The only thing I'm reserved on this track about is the sinewy vocals - 4/5<br />ah yes, Die Another Day, the critically blasted Bond theme - well I actually like it! I know I'm in a minority but it's a great song, energetic, meaningful and with a great video - 4/5<br />the album ends with the rather dramatic Easy Ride, which opens with a lush string intro and into a strumming guitar, with Madge yearing for &quot;A good life&quot;. Great ending to a very enjoyable album - 5/5<br />Overall, I think this album has been horribly ignored, and maybe someday people will look back and accept it for the joy it is.
B000003S0P|5.0|This was King Crimson's last album before breaking up(temporarily) in 1974. Their last &quot;classic&quot; album some would say. Not quite up to par with &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;... but then again, what is? This is a much darker album than you're typical King Crimson album. Songs about nightmares and such, and it really captures that dark feeling with each song. Something else to point out, this album is harder and more guitar driven than previous releases for KC... metal before metal some would suggest. Outstanding guitarwork as usual... lots of catchy grooves and hard riffs, and occasionally a mellower piece. Much less emphasis on the orchestral stuff. <br />Once again, this is about as progressive as it gets... the same could be said for a lot of KC releases. One of their best efforts to date...and a fine pre-cursor to metal. Just buy it.
B00011RPB0|3.0|First of all, I love little offbeat, leisurely-paced, melancholy movies that come out of left field.  And I expected to love this one, having had similar surreally lonely visits to Tokyo, but the movie couldn't begin to live up to the hype... and the multiple Oscar nominations.  The first American woman to receive a Best Director Oscar nomination... for this?  Maybe a STUDENT Oscar!  I'll give her some credit for an imaginative script--or at least an imaginative idea. Has a Best Picture nominee ever been so poorly edited? When there are so many mismatched cuts in a film, I have to ultimately blame the director. You get the feeling that whole scenes were hacked out to try and pick up the langorous pace--like where did Johansson's pink wig come from in the middle of the first long party sequence? Yes, Bill Murray was good, but I got the sense that he wasn't so much directed as just doing a slightly darker and more sympathetic version of his usual schtick. He's been winning awards right and left, but that was hardly a best-of-the-best performance. Certainly Giovanni Ribisi as Scarlett Johansson's busband was poorly directed... and/or scripted. He's not that bad an actor, is he?  I really wanted this to be the little gem others are claiming it is. I see this happen periodically, where an odd little movie starts building momentum as the &quot;surprise hit of the season&quot;--and suddenly no one's willing to admit the emporer has no clothes--especially when the emperor/director has such a fine Hollywood pedigree.
B000003S09|5.0|If I could describe this album in 1 word... I'd say epic. They obviously went for something big and grand with this, and they might of got a little more than they bargained for. King Crimson's debut album, and probably their best. 5 tracks, and each one brilliant and unique in it's own way. The musicianship here is just amazing. Some fine guitarwork and drumming, not to mention several other instruments which add to that &quot;epic&quot; effect. <br />The first track, &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;, starts off with a very powerful riff and some interesting sounding vocal effects, and then goes into a jazzy sort of trance that really showcases the band's talent and musicianship. The drumming here is phenominal. A very energetic song, and makes you think the album is gonna sound a lot harder than how it actually does. They immediately slow things down a lot with &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot;, a ballad I guess you could call it. Great melodies here, and very soft yet emotional vocals. As every song on this album has a personality of it's own, this one feels you're in a dream. The next track, &quot;Epitaph&quot;, probably hits the hardest out of all of them. Unlike &quot;I Talk to the Wind&quot;.. this song has a much bigger feel, and much of a darker feel as well. Very emotional. &quot;Moonchild&quot;, my least favorite track on the album, just kinda confuses me. The first couple of minutes are very laid back and ballad-ish, and then it goes into some abient stuff for the remaining 9 minutes of the song. An interesting song, but I'm not sure if i quite get it. The last song, &quot;The Court of the Crimson King&quot;, is probably the definitive song on this album. Like &quot;Epitaph&quot;, this song also has a very grand feel to it. Just as emotional sounding, but it's not going for a depressing feel. <br />Overall, &quot;In The Court of the Crimson King&quot; is a great album, near perfect I'd say. This is about as progressive as it got in 1969. This album is gonna hold up for many years to come. Make sure you own this essential piece of music history.
076790592X|1.0|I read this insipid book and it's about the only hour of my life I wish I could have back. Mitch Albom strikes me as a soulless man who needed to be kicked in the head with the idea that being a fantastically \\"successful\\" sports writer or sportscaster or sports lawyer (or whatever irrelevant profession he was totally obsessed with) was ultimately less important than being a father or husband to the people who tolerated him. And then when he finally did get kicked in the head with that message by a dying former teacher (who also tolerated him) who imparted it to him, the moron writes a vapid, obvious little book about the wisdom of the man, all couched in a reminder that he himself <BR>Mitch Albom took time out of his life to go visit the old guy EVERY TUESDAY and retrieve the little morsels of wisdom from him just for us. The whole time I was reading that book, I was pretty sure that the advice probably was somehow profound when it left the Morrie's mouth, but by the time it landed on Albom's ears, it became really simplified and petty-- like (drum roll).... \\"Money might buy you a car but it won't buy you happiness!!!\\"-- and unfortunately transposed into the key of money-making opportunism. I think maybe Morrie was trying to help Mitch Albom out of his own, individual, uniquely desperate moral mess but of course Mitch Albom just saw it as collateral knowledge to pass on to become... a SUCCESSFUL sports-something-cum-\\"author.\\"   I'm pretty sure Mitch Albom sucked all the profundity right out of anything Morrie had to say, and Morrie's quiet legacy is better off without Mitch Albom blundering around the English Language on his behalf. Too bad Morrie didn't write a corresponding book about the visits. He could have called it \\"Tuesdays Wasted with an Obtuse Man who misses all my points, big and small.\\" However, wasn't Hank Azaria in the TV movie? That redeems it a little. Some people find this book life-changing and inspiring. So is the back of the Cheerio's box, and it's not so self-aggrandizing. Don't tell me he wrote another book?
B00008PX8P|5.0|I cannot add more words than what the other viewers have already posted. I do want to say that this DVD simply surpassed all my expectations on what I would see and hear! The concerts, TV appearances, etc. are excellent. I especially loved it when they showed them from the very early years when they were young, lean and mean. The later years still showed their veracity, but also their improvement on their performances  (Musically that is).  It is a far cry better than \\"The Song Remains the Same\\".
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was really, really looking forward to this movie.  I like Bill Murray.  I like films set in Asia in general, and Japan in particular.  I'm a fan of directors such as Akira Kurosawa and Zhang Yimou.  I thought this movie would somehow be in the same vein or in the same spirit as the films from those two directors.  Boy was I wrong.  Instead we get a movie about absolutely nothing...and that's no exageration nor is it an understatement.  The film literally goes nowhere.<br />Plot?  Don't look for it here.  Characterization?  Sorry.  Wasted potential?  You bet.<br />With a setting, in what is to most Americans, an exotic locale (Tokyo) you would think there would at least be some beautiful scenery.  Instead we get all these shots of the characters in their hotel room or in the hotel bar.  What a waste.  The few scenes we do get of beautiful Japan such as Mt.Fuji and Kyoto are short-lived, disjointed and do nothing to move the plot forward--but then we must remember there is no plot.<br />The character played by Scarlett Johannsen (Charlotte) is supposed to be this young, highly educated, and seemingly precocious wife trying to \\"find her place in the world.\\"  She's in Japan accompanying her photographer husband played by Giovanni Ribisi.  Bill Murray's character (Bob Harris) is a middle-aged American film star who is bored with his wife and his life; he's in Japan to plug Suntory whisky and collect a nice paycheck of $2 million for his trouble.  Both of the main characters don't want to be in Japan and their vacant stares and apathetic countenaces in the face of all the neon blitz of Tokyo are meant to convey that.<br />The problem is that they both keep those vacant stares throughout the entire movie.  Literally nothing happens even after they meet each other and hang out together.<br />The film feels like Sophia Coppola told the actors to just do whatever they wanted (which is mostly just sitting and looking bored--how can you be bored in Tokyo???) and then she would edit the footage and try to make a film out of it.  We see Charlotte in her panties staring outside her hotel window.  We see Bob shaving.  We see Charlotte hanging fake cherry blossom ornaments in her hotel room in her underwear.  We see Bob at the hotel bar drinking Suntory whisky.  We see Charlotte in her panties staring outside her hotel window again.  We see Bob talking to his wife on the phone.  We see Bob at the hotel bar drinking Suntory whisky.  Ad nauseum.<br />Those critics who are raving about this film call this Bill Murray's break out role.  Um...excuse me, but this is the same character Bill Murray has been playing in all of his movies.  The funny straight-man type.  Transplant his character from Ghostbusters or Stripes and the movie would be no different.<br />And as for Scarlett Johannsen, if staring at everything with a blank look in your eyes is acting...sign me up.  I can do that and get paid for it, too.<br />I don't understand where all the accolades and the hype are coming from.  I could have made a better movie if I filmed my trip to Asia last year.  I met more interesting people and I saw more awesome sights than you'll see in this travesty on celluloid.  Please do not let this film put you off on visiting Japan.  The real thing could never be this boring!  Coppola just doesn't have the vision, skill, or maybe even the talent to make an interesting film.<br />She has much more studying and much more work to do before she can even be called a competent film-maker, much less a great one.  \\"Lost in Translation\\" does not deserve to win any awards, unless it is Worst movie or Most Overhyped movie of the Year.<br />I think with the critical acclaim this movie has been getting and all the nominations from the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards, there is a sort of \\"Emperor's clothes\\" phenomenon.  Well, I'm telling you THIS EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES!  I wish the critics would open their eyes to this fact.  This film is absolutely dreadful.<br />I amsorry for all the people that have wasted both their time and money watching this film or buying it on DVD.  And that absolutely includes me.
B00004RF8J|5.0|My non-musical enthusiast husband had even seen this movie, and somehow I'd made it twenty-plus years without.  How did this happen??<br />Ah, the sweet story of an innocent young man and his eye-catching plant who he struggles to feed:  &quot;Looks like you're not happy, 'less I open a vein.&quot;<br />The best thing about this movie, to me, was the cartoonish quality as seen in the Skid Row scenery, Audrey II, the dentist office and Audrey I's imagination sequences.  Although I have not seen Little Shop live, I can see how it was made for the stage.  Like Evita, I think the movie version captured the essence of the film very well.  Overall:  great and unusual story, fantastic music, wonderful Eighties' quality about the whole thing.  <br />By the way, this movie is based on the musical, which is based on a 1960 movie.  Now THAT I would like to see next!

0385510438|5.0|There are so many riviting aspects to this latest Grisham novel that it's hard to know where to begin.  First, there is the old vs. the new with regards to the south--how it has changed, is changing, and will change.  That in itself is enough for a book and reminds me of other writers who have tackled that slippery slope:  McCrae in his Bark of the Dogwood and Conroy in Prince of Tides.  But the most intriguing aspect of this Grisham book is his characters.  Then again, that's always the most intriguing aspect of his work.  In any other writer's hands, the character of Danny Padgitt (how's that for a white trash name?) would be a cardboard cut-out.  But in Grisham's he's flesh-and-blood.  And Danny literally &quot;gives&quot; the newspaper in the town new life when he commits a murder.  As with all media, they love sensationalism, and the Ford County Times--the paper that Willie Traynor now owns--is no exception. Seizing the opportunity, Traynor splashes the gory details all over &quot;the Times&quot; and the result is that he an instant celebrity and also a marked man.  Padgitt finally gets his, but not full-out.  His life sentence is evidently not quite as &quot;lifelong&quot; as everyone thought, and as soon as he's released, the killing starts. This, all because of his statement to the jury on his way out that he will have his revenge on the jurors.  Lovely.  Especially if you're one of them.  All through this excellent plot, Grisham weaves the lives (or lackthereof) of the colorful characters in the town--yet another aspect of southern writing (again, McCrae or Conroy), and it's really these people that create the landscape and backdrop for this book.  The entire novel reads like a well-done combination of Grisham's legal thrillers, his homage to Mississippi (A Painted House), and his foray into small town Southern America.  Without a doubt this is his best effort to date.
044651652X|5.0|This warm, very much needed, intelligent, and caring book is a brilliant study of the human heart and the human condition.  It's a story told with such tenderness and depth that it will break your heart.  Though not sappy-sweet in sentimentality, it is warm and loving. Just beautiful.  Would also like to recommend &quot;The Five People You Meet in Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; as two other excellent reads.
B00008H2LB|3.0|In spite of some people arguing to the contrary, this band is not innovating, much in the same way as most bands in the rock terrain. If you want innovation these days, or at least an interesting blend of styles/rhythms, you have to turn to hip-hop and R&amp;B these days. Unfortunately we're hearing a lot of refried/recanned concepts in rock these days. As for Linkin Park, I cannot avoid but thinking of good ole Limp Bizkit when I hear them, but -even thogh I was not a huge fan of Fred Durst and his combo- I found them far more innovative back in the days when it occurred them to blend rock and rap.<br />There are definitely some songs in this album that stick to you, with the closing track (&quot;Numb&quot;) being the best example of this. However, I have a hard time sitting through the entire album, not because I find it challending or hard to listen to, but rather because I find it largely repetitive. I still give it three stars, because it's well produced and the combination of two vocalists is rather interesting, but -much like in the case of Evanescense- the guitar work can be toned down, without lossing the band too much.
B00018D44U|5.0|Wow!  Norah definitely has something special to offer her fans with this album.  It really is a MUST HAVE!  I've read quite a few reviews leading up to the release of this record and I am glad that the critics agree overall.  Even though there's a parallel resemblance to &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; I think that resemblance is simply her signature style, her soulful voice and her unique lyrics.  This album definitely steps it up a notch, and in Norah's world it feels like a wonderful stroll.
0884271536|2.0|As with the Goal, the concepts that Goldratt uses to proselytize are a subtle mix of concepts that are on the border of being completely natural to the reader.  Anyone who has managed projects, worked with EVM or other common methods will find a lot of the material that he presents to be just a slight twist on what they are used to seeing. In doing so, he manages to introduce a number of concepts that are new to the audience, but are not totally alien to their knowledge of how projects ought to work.<br />Unfortunately, he goes one step further (as in The Goal) and uses the form of fiction to tie the whole thing together.  When I was done with the book, I set it down and said &quot;those were some interesting concepts, and they sure helped the folks in the book&quot;.  It was a few moments later that I realized that the characters, plot and workability of the concepts in the book was complete fiction.  Everything worked so well when the characters used his methods, and didn't work at all when they didn't.  That has a disturbing tone to it, since I know plenty of projects that have gone the other way in both cases.<br />This is not to say that the concepts that Goldratt brings forth aren't interesting, valid or usefull (especially when effectively tied to other management concepts), but it is to say that you won't get anything useful out of this book, aside from a desire to attend one of his seminars.
B000089RVX|3.0|This c.d. was a great reminder of why I don't listen to or buy music that I first hear on the radio.  A couple of really powerful songs with deep emotional core, and then... boredom.  Boring guitars, melodies, drums, the piano is okay.  Really, it just boils down to her voice (I gave it three stars because it's such a great voice), but other than that, it isn't very exciting. Maybe if they had a guitarist who dared to even attempt a decent solo.  For my money, find a song by From Autumn To Ashes called Short Stories with Tragic Endings, a million times better than anything this band ever did
B00006BTCA|5.0|i can't BELIEVE i just saw THAT MANY 1 star reviews IN A ROW.<br />i'm definitly under the impression that the same person did that.<br />anyway, this is a wonderful album.  you can &quot;this sounds like joy division&quot; all you want, i like this.  if it REALLY sounded like joy division, I'D hate it, becuase i don't LIKE JOY DIVISION.  <br />dark, brooding, and at the same time a good album to put on while you're sleeping, it's definitly worth getting.  If anything, buy it for that guys voice.  he sounds SOO good.
0385510438|5.0|THE LAST JUROR blends Grisham's slice of life style in PAINTED HOUSE with his traditional potboilers, making it more real and not so fantastic as past works.<br />The first person narrator, Willie Traynor, takes over a small town paper, The Times, in 1971, about the time local punk, Danny Padgitt, rapes and murders a young woman in front of her children.  As owner/editor of the Times, Traynor gets to know many of the local characters, not least of which is a black woman from the wrong side of the racially divided tracks, named Callie Ruffin.<br />Callie is THE LAST JUROR referred to in the title, as the novel is more about the relationship between her and Traynor than it is about the criminal, Danny Padgitt.  Grisham does not disappoint the reader, as by the end of his trial Padgitt threatens the jurors, that if they find him guilty he will &quot;get&quot; every one of them.  They find him guilty anyway.<br />Though sentenced to two &quot;life&quot; sentences in the Mississippi penal system, Padgitt ends up serving about 10 years.  And then jurors start getting murdered.<br />The meat of the book is devoted to Traynor and Callie and her remarkable family who have managed to educate themselves out of their racist little town.  Callie has broken barriers throughout her life, and being the first black to sit on a Ford County jury (and the last juror seated on the jury) was just one of her many accomplishments.  The lunches cooked by Callie for Traynor are mouthwatering to read.<br />Over all, the story and wonderful prose are very compelling.  With a twist ending that comes as a welcome surprise I felt this was Grisham's best work yet and I highly recommend it to Grisham fans and first time readers.
B000088E6D|5.0|Until yesterday I had never heard of this singer;Michael Buble'.I put on a headset at the mall and was sampling their featured CD's....this being one of many.To say I was blown away doesn't begin to describe my reation to what I was hearing.<br />I'm a 44 year old who grew up listening to, and truly loves the standards, big band,and 50's and 60's music. I am basically time wharped with my choice of music. The orchestration and arrangements only make this CD better. They already had a great voice to start it all.David Foster turns everything he touches into gold.I had to keep looking at the CD case, because it was hard to believe that someone so young was putting out this amazing sound. Like me, he must have an &quot;old soul&quot;.<br />I have already shared this CD with several of my family and they were truly impressed as well. Try doing that with Hip-Hop and Rap....yeah right. With younger vocalists performing these timeless pieces, this music could last forever, and this is one lady who is extremely greatful.<br />I look foward to seeing where this young man's career will take home.He has a new fan in New Jersey.....that's for sure!
B0000UJL96|4.0|The year was 1991,and alot of things were changing in the world around us.One of the most dramatic changes was the fact that the Cold War was finally coming to an end.Regan and Gorbachoff(excuse me if I mis-spelled his name) were finally negotiating for peace.The Iron Curtain was coming down...as well as the Berlin Wall and the steps towards peace were being taken.<BR>        On a less serious note,Paramount Studios was trying to figure out how to overcome the disaster that was Star Trek V:The Final Frontier so that they could make some big bucks just in time for the 25th Anniversary of Star Trek.It didn't take a Vulcan to figure out that the best thing to do was to get the old war horses back for one last movie...and make it a good one.<BR>AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THEY GOT!!!!<BR>        They brought in Trek II director Nicholas Meyer and Leonard Nimoy(who wrote and directed III and IV) who came up with a brillant concept.Star Trek had always been at the forefront of present day social and political issues since the series first aired in 1966.Now Nimoy and Meyer decided to bring the peace between the U.S. and Russia into a sci-fi context.And,as usual,Star Trek hit it on the head.<BR>       From the explosion of the Klingon Moon of Praxis(the Chernobyl incident),to the dismantling of the Neutral Zone outpost(the fall of the Berlin Wall)to the idea that only a hardline conservitive like Captain Kirk could bridge the gap between the Federation and the Klingons(Regan's repore with Gorbachoff,or as Spock put it &quot;Only Nixon could go to China.&quot;)the film effectively places current events into the sci-fi context.And in between there is intrigue,betrayal,murder,and redemption which almost turns the film into a political thriller. <BR>          The fine performances,not just by the crew of the Enterprise,but those of Kim Catrall as an idealistic,but mis-guided Vulcan,and the wonderfully eccentric General Chang by Christopher Plummer,the great story by Meyer and Nimoy,and the hair-raising action of the dogfight with the cloaked Bird of Prey makes this a terrific final curtain to one of the most exciting ensamble casts in film(or TV) history.<BR>         The Special Edition features audio commentary from Meyer as well as a documentary on the making of the film(which also discusses the U.S./Russian peace process) and a wonderful tribute to Deforest Kelley,aka Doctor &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy.<BR>If you're wondering why I'm gushing so much over the film and only gave it four stars,there's a reason.I'm tired of William Shatner whinning and moaning about how Meyers didn't use his ideas(As he did in previous docs. from the other films)The prime example is on the scene where Kirk and Spock are in the council chamber when Kirk exclaims &quot;LET THEM DIE!&quot; Shatner wanted Kirk to make a face as if he regretted saying that.The documentary shows the deleted scene in which Shatner,of course,overacts the gesture.But for the rest of the documentary,he whines about it!<BR>Other than that,It's a great disc.
B0000DBJDM|4.0|As someone fast approaching his fourth decade on this planet, I'm familiar with Pink Floyd and consider myself a fan, but not a big one. I'm relatively familiar with the bands history from beginning to end, but much of my familiarity with their music centers around their middle period. I hadn't ever seen this film prior to it's release on dvd, and I was only somewhat familiar with the music period featured on it.<br />So, from this perspective, I want to tell you that I think the Directors Cut is the better film to see for someone like myself, or especially someone new to Pink Floyd. I watched the straight concert film (non-directors cut) first, and while I did enjoy it, there wasn't always a whole lot going on to hold my attention throughout. When I watched the Directors Cut later on, I found that I enjoyed it more as there was more to see.  <br />For the average person, seeing the unadulterated opening pan shot from the beginning isn't absolutely necessary. Maybe if you're stoned, as some reviewers seem to suggest here, slower passages where not much is going on such as this could be fascinating for you. I, on the other hand, drugless and with most faculties intact, found the \\"punched up\\" Directors Cut more involving with the inclusion of the space graphics & footage. Even with that, we still get a decent amount of the pan shot anyway.  <br />I, contrary to some here, really liked the shots of artwork throughout the film too. These were some GREAT images to contemplate as the music was playing in the backround. I feel more connected to our shared human history when I see such great works of art and it was an enhancement to see them featured here on film. A wonderful marriage of sound and image, I thought. I also enjoyed the computer graphical representation of how Pompeii looked prior to the cities destruction. (I just wish there was a little more direct, one-to-one matching of graphics to actual scenic shots).<br />For those who have complained about the Directors Cut, I think the point to remember is that this film wouldn't have been made without his original idea and his drive to get it accomplished. If you think his new version is less compelling or isn't as well executed, fine. But,he deserves some slack here. I say we owe him some leeway to indulge in any way he sees fit, especially with the inclusion of the original film to salve any offended sensibilities.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This is his best cd he has made. this is the cd that will always be the best. People still bump it. People always play it. It is the best. <br />Rip Pac
B000002KO1|5.0|It seems that the most impactful music, if not necessarily the best work, of many artists is their first album. Maybe it has something to do with living a lifetime, building up emotion, frustration and ideas until that moment when you can finally release it all on record. Then, every year or two, you get to put out another record. It would only follow that those subsequent releases, perhaps more sophisticated, more nuanced and skillful, might still be lacking a certain spark. <br />This first Pretenders record is their finest moment. Yes, there have been other good moments, but nothing as consistently good. Of course, when half the band dies off by the second record, surely that would have a dramatic impact as well. <br />I was reminded how good this album was when stumbling on these reviews on Amazon. I hadn't listened to the album in a few years, and reading the reviews again reminded me how good it was. So, I dug it out today and played the cd again, and yes, it still retains that spark. You can't say that about all that many albums some twenty years later. The contrast of sweetness and balls-to-the-walls aggression mixes quite nicely on this record. Just when you think you wouldn't want to be walking on the same side of the street if Chrissy Hynde came along, she becomes this gentle figure of compassion.<br />All the songs are really good, but I have the most affection for the duo of 'The Phone Call' &amp; 'Up the Neck'. Grind-it-up melody is how I'll describe it. And since few have mentioned them, 'Lovers of Today' &amp; 'Private Life' are worthy of specific attention here as well.<br />The cd version could stand an update, whether it be to SACD or DVD-A, or even a simple remastering. The original transfer to disc is a bit harsh, not uncommon to the early transfers done when cd technology was starting to take over. Certainly this is one deserving of such renewal. Harsh or not, don't let that stop you from marching to the store or the local library to check outthis great slice of &quot;punk/new-wave&quot; rock. It doesn't necessarily seem so &quot;punk&quot; or &quot;new-wave&quot; to our modern ears (back when this came out, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers were considered punk/new wave too, believe it or not.. it's just that people were so accustomed to rock music sounding only a certain way, that anything even slightly outside of those constricted boundaries was considered wierd. Now, it just sounds aggressively melodic with a little &quot;potty mouth&quot; thrown in from time to time).<br />Chrissy Hynde once said that she used to practice singing for hours on end in her bedroom closet before she struck out on her own. We can all be very thankful that she stepped out of that closet.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Its not about shoes, its not about getting shot nine times, and its not about his chromed out steering wheel.  His flow is pretty good and his content is damn good.  Beat wise &quot;through the wire&quot; is the best.  &quot;Two words&quot; and &quot;All falls down&quot; are also amazing.  If I hadn't heard &quot;Through the Wire&quot; I probably would have given this five stars.  I guess I was expecting another beat like &quot;get by&quot;.  What I love about this album is the cohesion.  Its amazing what having a single producer can do for the flow of an album.  I also love that mos def, kweli, common, freeway, and jay z appear on the same album.  A REFRESHING PIECE OF AUTHENTIC HIP HOP, GO BUY IT.
B000099T2L|1.0|Beyonce es una persona muy interesada, la verdad a ella solo le interesa ganar premios, pero no es nadie :( lastima
B0001AP12G|5.0|The first great album of 2000 anything.  Kanye has put together a masterpiece that should be studied for future generations.  He has masterfully blended soulful beats with thoughtful rhymes.  Kanye has made a wise decision to stay away from cookie-cutter  MTV, 106th &amp; Park brainless type of hip hop.  I will not pick any stand out tracks, everything here is equally bangin'.  Although I will say I was kind of wishin' to hear Common and Jigga on a track together but I still can't complain.  Now everyone has had something to say about his rhyme skills.  Let me just say this, Kanye's style is that he has no style.  His subject matter is enough to keep you listening for more.  Put it this way, on the wonderful song &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; feat Jigga,  Kanye actully steals the show.  By the end of this year every other song on the radio will sound like a Kanye ripoff.  Funny for a guy who is a &quot;College Dropout&quot;,  he is about to take a whole new generation of producers/ MC's to school. -18651
B00006CXXU|5.0|Un disco muy impresionante y bastante bueno, mejor que &quot;In the Zone&quot; de BS, la verdad aqui en Mexico se a vendido como pan caliente, Miss Aguilera regreso mejor que al principio, aunque en ventas no pero si un disco de calidad :)
B000084T18|3.0|I have already reviewed this album, so I won't do it again.  I have heard too many &quot;50 is the best rapper ever comments.&quot;  Now if the argument was about Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, Chuck D, etc., then that's a statement with merits to back it.  But 50, come on you all.  So I just want to know what makes an MC (especially 50 Cent) so great.  Is it lyrical substance or being gansta?  Is it versatility, rhyme patterns, and flow or is it being shot, talking about cars, and pimping hoes?  This review isn't to necessarily knock anybody, but I really would like to know the types of MCs you all believe are so great. <BR> <BR>Can you believe I had someone tell me that Juvenile was a better skilled MC than Common Sense?  Needless to say I question his intelligence.
B0001AP158|1.0|I love Bon Jovi.They wrote some classic songs,and Jon Bon Jovi is one of the best frontmen ever.But this DVD is a disgrace to rock 'n roll.All I can say is &quot;why did they make this&quot;?It is 108 minutes of slow acoustic ballads.&quot;You Give Love A Bad Name&quot; was one of the best rock songs of the 80's.Now it is a crappy pop song.Same thing with &quot;Livin' On A Prayer&quot; and &quot;Bad Medicine&quot;.They went from rocker's to piano ballads.&quot;It's My Life&quot; and &quot;Everday are modern rock anthems.Here they are piano ballads.The only good songs are &quot;Wanted Dead Or Alive&quot;,&quot;Misunderstood&quot;,and one of the new songs,&quot;Last Man Standing&quot;.The limited edition has a bonus disc with a feature called &quot;Clip Poker&quot; where if you win a hand of poker against Bon Jovi,you can watch a song from the 2003 concert in Hyde Park.Overall,get &quot;The Crush Tour&quot; instead.That is Bon Jovi as Bon Jovi,not this crap.
B0001AP12G|5.0|If you are a fan of hip-hop music yet you tire from the trend heard on the radio these days, you won't be disappointed. Kanye West has a flavor and soul in his songs that can't be matched by anyone short of Outkast. His creative use of classic samples and originally passive lyrical delivery makes him a great asset to roc-a-fella. Combine this with collaborations with the most creative acts in hip hop(Mos Def, Jay-Z, Common, Talib Kweli, and twista) and you have not only the dopest hip hop album to come out in a while but a diverse, classic, and soulful collection of music with an equally inspiring set of lyrics.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Damn... This CD is hot. I had my doubts about Kanye being an MC cause I never heard his flows, but he definitely lives up to the hype. His topic matter is extremely refreshing. He goes from humor (as in the track \\"we don't care\\" where he opens the song up with \\"Oh yeah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing. To all my people drug dealing just to get by / stack your money till it gets sky high) to an intense look at the system we live in (\\"all falls down\\" is completely written around people not knowing what they are doing while in life and attending college throughout the whole process...) - He keeps a very introspective style throughout the whole album which is wonderful to see in this era of `bling-bling' and gangsta rap. Some great guest appearances (Talib Kweli and Common, Jay Z, Consequence, Ludacris) help move the album along. Overall it doesn't sag in any places, though the last track (\\"Last Call\\") is a little heavy, weighing in at over 12 minutes. I wouldn't have a problem with it, but it just the story of how Kanye got to where he is... Interesting the first few times, but I have a feeling it will begin to annoy me the more I listen to this album.<BR>Overall I gave it 4 stars. I think it is closer to 4 and a half, but I couldn't give it 5 simply because of that last track being so damn long and unnecessary... Otherwise, though, a very solid album. It'll be in heavy rotation among my CDs for a while. Instant classic. <BR>Peace.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is too hot. This is gonna be a classic for sure. A new start for hip-hop, no Cashmoneymodels who can't rap, no Chingy's, no Nelly's...just soulfull beats with great rhymes. Just 2 words: GET IT!!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Yes, that's right, I like this album. Sure, I'm following the crowd...or am I?<br />I don't know anyone personally who likes this album. In fact, I don't know many people at all who like Radiohead - the few I do know prefer The Bends. However, this doesn't prevent me from liking this album. My personal view is that OK Computer is Radiohead's best album and that, at the moment, Radiohead are the best band in the world. Also, I believe the people who hate this album are merely being hypocritical, because, as one reviewer claimed, more people hate Radiohead than like them! Who's the sheep there then? I know, how immature am I. All I'm saying is that hating Radiohead fervently and insulting them and their fans is a pointless waste of time, and people shouldn't think they're being original because they are acting in this moronic way. It puts a lot of people off music they might actually like.<br />Anyway, I'll get back to reviewing the album (something many of the one star brigade did very badly, because they made no musically informed comment whatsoever). It has been said that this album takes a couple of listens to like (if you ever want to like it), and its true. I can see how many uninformed people are put off easily (the \\"informed\\" people probably would like it if it said \\"Pink Floyd Newly Discovered Off-cuts\\" on the case). What I really don't understand is how it is possible not to at least appreciate great tracks such as Paranoid Android and Karma Police. Though I've named only two tracks, there isn't a dreaded filler in sight (well...Fitter Happier...maybe). The album evolves as you listen to it, almost as if taking you on a musical journey, from the quirkiness of Airbag to the, well, quirkiness of The Tourist. Thom Yorke doesn't really sound like a girl (unless you think that wearing a coat in the rain makes you a homosexual), though I won't be pretentious about his versatile and stunning vocals. Someone once wrote that, although OK Computer was really well madeand all that, it isn't enjoyable to listen to like The Bends is. I disagree. Actually, they're wrong, because I still like to listen to this album even though I have had it for a while. In fact, I'm surprised at how good the album sounds each time I listen to it, as I easily get bored of some albums if I listen to them too much.<br />This may not be THE greatest album of all time, though it really is as good as Beethoven's string quartets and symphonies, The Smiths' The Queen Is Dead, Rachmaninov's piano concertos, Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation, Mozart's Don Giovanni, the Pixies' Doolittle and Bach's St Matthew's Passion (to name but a few) in my view at least. Now I think I'll leave the crowd, shear my fleece, get a musical education (oops, no, already done that one) and grow-up - maybe listen to real music...Miles Davis perhaps...or I could start an anti-Radiohead campaign and fight for oppression of the people of Tibet and for more people to starve in Africa and for a totalitarian society and for globalisation and for all that other stuff that Radiohead pretend to not like (they're actually a corporate band y' know, they're not a REAL alternative band, or at least if you think about it with only one brain cell while gleefully smiling at your own hypocrisy and stupidity)...oh, for a minute there, I lost myself...
B000089CJI|5.0|This album shocked me. It is totally different. It's been playing on &quot;repeat&quot; for days now. I wonder when I'll get sick of it?! Hopefully, not before they release another album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Yes, another review of this album by yet another person expressing their view. I was reading through the previous reviews. Interesting fact 1: the majority of the low reviews were less than four lines and as the stars went up, so did the amount written by each reviewer. What does this mean then? Well, if you read some of these low reviews you'll find a lot of them are complete rubbish. A handful are valid and interesting; I could tell they knew what they were talking about when they said one of my favourite albums wasn't actually as good as I thought it was and that I must be really stupid (we're talking really, really, really stupid yuppie kid here) to like it. I know what they're saying, kind of, 'cause I know some people very well who, you know, think they're cool by listening to certain types of music.<br />Interesting fact 2: I like this album, I think it is good<BR>Interesting fact 3: I think Radiohead are pretty decent<BR>Interesting fact 4: I think that people who only like Pablo Honey really are stupid...that album was an obvious Pixies rip-off<BR>Interesting facts 5: I'm not a yuppie, I think Britpop was pretty awful, I think The Bends showed quite clearly that Radiohead had no affiliation with Britpop and never will <BR>Interesting fact 6: I disklike being insulted - all those people who insult Radiohead fans without any real cause are exremely rude. Have your free speech but at least be civil towards other people, learn how to review something in a decent way. Btw, if you want to see some pretty good reviews of this album, go to amazon.co.uk, plz<br />In terms of Radiohead's other albums (for they have to be considered rather than declaring Radiohead to be the worst band ever because one album opener was a little boring) it of course doesn't &quot;rock&quot; as much as The Bends, or even HTTT. Although Electioneering is quite &quot;rocky&quot; (not many people like it, I do, maybe I'm silly) OK Computer isn't that kind of music, nor is it amazingly ground breaking in its experimentation. Though considering how many people consider Nevermind ground breaking, perhaps it is. I suppose this is an album you either like, hate or think is boring. I like.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Man, I'm tellin' y'all, Kanye West debut album is not like any other album out there right now.  The only album that comes close is Bubba Sparxxx's &quot;Deliverance.&quot;  And I mean that when it comes to subject matter.  Both artists are lyricall without putting out the ice and guns and all that.  Kanye produced the whole album and deserves to be up there when it comes to the top producers in the hip-hop game.  It is a breath of fresh air in a game filled with 2Pac and Biggie impersonators.  Nuff Said!
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah and her band have traveled on to a different place, but there's still enough familiar decor to make sure the album &quot;feels like home&quot;.  The tuneful arrangements, superb musicianship, organic production, and expert songwriting/song selection are all tighter and more focused on this record, and Norah's singing feels a bit more comfortable, her voice slightly more free.<br />Combining songs that she and/or her band wrote, a couple of reworked covers, and a simply gorgeous version of Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia&quot; complete with fitting lyrics by Norah herself (and thus retitled &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;), this album follows roughly the same framework as her debut -- only here it feels as if it's been executed better.<br />The record does have more of a country bent to it overall, but the songs range from bluesier numbers, folk ditties, and light bluegrass, to the straight ahead jazz piano of the album's closer.  The layered vocals in the chorus of &quot;Carnival Town&quot; are hauntingly beautiful, the up front questioning on &quot;What Am I To You?&quot; cuts to the heart of what relationships are about, &quot;Humble Me&quot; is quietly spiritual, and Dolly Parton's guest vocals on &quot;Creepin' In&quot; work wonderfully as her voice floats smoothly around Norah's lead.  That song and the album's first single, &quot;Sunrise&quot;, are both more uptempo than anything Norah's done before, and as great as her slow lilt is, it's refreshing to hear her starting to speed things up every once in a while.<br />However, the laid-back aura persists everywhere else, and if you liked the first album's wonderful lazy daydream feel you'll almost certainly like this disc as well.  Though if you enjoyed her first album for it's jazzier aspects you might want to borrow a friend's copy first, as on this release they've more or less taken a back seat to everything else.  Otherwise, highly recommended!
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I ordered the copy that claims to be 240 minutes but wanted to say that when it got here it says the running time is 6 hours.  I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but it seems to be complete.  <br />Not sure what's going on with amazon.com on this title.
B00013PHGS|4.0|Talkie Walkie is rich, somber, elegant and simply a peaceful venture into the minds of a French electronica duo who seem to have found a way to impress.  I heard only segments of &quot;Moon Safari&quot; so my knowledge of these guys' older work may be limited, from what I heard on this album it's perked my curiosity to go into past albums of this group.  Though I heard &quot;Hz Legend&quot; was more of a afterthought then anything else.  I heard the song &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; in Sofia Coppola's &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; and was right away captivated by it's slow motion beats which augmented one of the best scenes in the movie.<br /> There are plenty of haunting melodies soaked with down tempo soundscapes.  My personal favorite tracks include &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot;, &quot;Cherry Blossom Girl&quot; and &quot;Universal Traveler&quot;.  All in all, it's a nice soothing album to listen to while I study or while trying my best to relax and bask in the harmony of life's simple aspects.
0780631684|3.0|This suspenseful cult movie is one of the few horror flicks of the last years that actually has an intriguing idea and a decent execution. <BR>Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is a teen student that is about to enter a plane in order to go to Paris with his classmates. Before he enters it, he starts seeing visions, premonitions and strange allucinations that force him to believe that something is terribly wrong. That feeling is enhanced when he enters the plane, and suddently feels that it is about o explode. So, Alex goes hysterical and leaves the plane along with six people, and afterwars it (surprise!) explodes. This is just the beginning of the process, as Alex soon discovers that death will be back to take the lives of those who escaped the explosion.<br />The concept is interesting and, although most of the movie`s strenght relies in its more nightmarish/ paranoid first twenty minutes, director James Wong (\\"X-Files\\", \\"Milennium\\") still knows how to keep things going in a surprising way. The death scenes are not only creative and thrilling, but also darkly comic. The atmosphere is gloomy with some appropriate blue tones, the score efficient and the acting satisfying. The character development could be better, but it`s still decent, and the timing and suspense are good.<br />This, like \\"Scream\\", is an edgy, clever picture, that also goes for the tongue-in-cheek approach (especially in the second half) and a fine horror movie about Generation X (it even has a dark, unsettling, mysterious mood). <BR>A good one.
0880793082|2.0|I purchased this deck expecting to receive the one pictured that is printed in Switzerland. All of the other reviews exclaim happily that it is as well. Instead of getting the red and white packaged deck in the mail I got a purple and coloured package from Game Systems U.S.A. that is printed in Belgium. Very dissapointing. The colours are greenish in hue and not true to the originals. I wish that the picture of the item and the reviews hadn't been so misleading, as I never would have purchased them if I had known.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Ok, so this isn`t quite &quot;It&quot;, that is, the best rock album ever, not even the best of its year, but it surely is a good one with much to enjoy. It`s a sucessful example of &quot;back to basics&quot;, since the songs are apparently simple (though quite well-crafted) and have not unecessary elements to it. The lyrics bring nothing new either, dealing with the same subjects since rock first appeared. However, even if it isn`t great, still makes for an entertaining and exciting debut, presenting enough energy and charisma to be an above average effort. The songs are catchy, fast paced, captivating and sound poppy without being repulsive or disposable... Not an easy thing to do, actually. Still, as a whole the album is a bit repetitive and should be more diverse and eclectic. It`s only rock n` roll, but I like it. Enjoy.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Argh! Awful! Terrible S L O W and boring!  Why Sofia Coppala  received a Golden Globe for this is beyond me. There is one good scene in the whole movie.  Thankfully Bill Murray helped one not to need pain killers to get through the whole movie.  What all of the Whopla was about for Coppala was beyond me.  Save your money.  If you must - rent it and weep.  This movie is lost alright but not in translation.  I made the mistake of buying it and immediatly lost it!  Thankfully!
B00004RIV4|2.0|Although the hype is strong, this record is nothing to write home about. Moloko`s previous albums were experimental, creative and a bit bizarre and offbeat. Their third release, however, lost a part of that touch, presenting a couple of fine moments and a lot of so-so ones. It`s not bad, it has clever and witty songs but the final result is lackluster. Roisin Murphy`s voice still engages, even if the songwriting is subpar and somewhat blah. The singles &quot;Indigo&quot; and &quot;The Time is Now&quot; are both fine compositions, but they are lost in here since the album goes on for too long and its interest quickly fades. All in all, this record is a good one to skip, there`s certainly better things to make and do than listen to it.
0790733226|4.0|When you see a film made by Robert Zemeckis, you can be sure that you are going to find three things in such movie:<br />1).- THE MOVIE HAS OUSTANDING TECHNICAL LEVEL: \\"Contact\\" has excellent visual effects, the worm holes seem very realistic, when Jodie Foster travels to another \\"planet\\", the scene looks spectacular. The photography in \\"Contact\\" is very detailed. The shots that show the outer space and the natural beauties surrounding the research centers are proof of the high technical level of the team behind \\"Contact\\". The use of footage of popular characters (like Bill Clinton) look as real or even more real that the scenes in \\"Forrest Gump\\" (same technical team behind \\"Contact\\", but with more experience and more technology than where they did \\"Forrest Gump\\" in 1994). By the way, the music is also perfect for this film, the composer was Alan Silvestri.<br />2).- THE MOVIE HAS AN INTERESTING CAST: in \\"Contact\\", we can find popular actors like Jodie Foster, James Woods, John Hurt, Tom Skerritt, Rob Lowe and Matthew McConaughey.<br />3).- THE MOVIE WILL BE INTERESTING, PERHAPS WILL BE FASCINATING: and \\"Contact\\" isn't the exception to this rule. The human beings are always interested in the study of other planets and solar systems, and we are always wandering if there is life in other place besides the Earth.<br />Robert Zemeckis is a director capable of tell a story in his movies, he has a lot of tricks and resources, he is very creative and he is always surrounded by the right people in every movie that he makes. Another interesting movies filmed by Robert Zemeckis are: \\"Forrest Gump\\", \\"Back To The Future\\", \\"Cast Away\\" and \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\".
0140067477|2.0|Hoff's general premise is that Winnie-the-Pooh is a wonderful embodiment of some of the fundamental principles of taoism.  If he limited himself to that discussion, the book would have been a much better read - he really does do a nice job of developing that theme.<BR>Unfortunately, Mr. Hoff's un-tsaoist ego attempts to get in the way, especially, when he attempts to give direct &quot;life lessons&quot; to his readers (as opposed to allowing his readers to draw them from the anecdotes he desribes).  Mr. Hoff at that point begins to evince a &quot;more buddhist, and thus cooler, than thou&quot; attitude in these portions of the book, and in the process reveals a lot of judgmentalism and close-mindedness.  A minor example that I happen to recall:  at some length, he belittles people who are devoted to exercise as being driven by some sort of vanity-driven compulsion.  That may be true in some cases, but Hoff illustrates no ability to comprehend that some people may enjoy the act of running, or walking, or biking, or whatever, simply for itself (something the tao favors). If we all were truly at peace with ourselves, I guess we'd be attempting to package our personal spirituality for material gain like Hoff.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is a production genius.  This album is a miust get for any rap fan.  If you like common, mos def and talib kawli then you will love Kanye West.  The beats from start to finish are original, fresh and hot.  By the way Kanye can also rap.  He is a better rapper than most rapper/producers.  With Jay Z on his way out, Kanye is the perfect man to carry the Roc in 2004
6304806442|2.0|I REFUSE TO BUY DVD'S THAT USE LETTERBOXED WIDESCREEN.  STUDIOS NEED TO GET A CLUE.  THAT MAKES SIX DVD'S I CAN'T BUY BECAUSE THEY WON'T PRESENT CORRECTLY ON MY TV.  I HAVE A 30 INCH 16:9 TV.  WHY WOULD I WANT TO  WATCH AN 18&quot; IMAGE LETTERBOXED WITHIN &quot;NORMAL MODE&quot; IN THE CENTER OF THE SCREEN?!
B000000WFZ|5.0|Certainly the music made this movie spectacular, gracing and moving one as the eyes were privy to the spectacular cinematography.<br />Morricone's compostion here is fluent with three distinct musical tributaries which play so well with the plotline: oboe, tribal, and religious.<br />How about the beauty of &quot;Gabriel's Oboe?&quot;  Simply magnificent!<br />The earthiness of the tribal drums and windflute are simply captivating.<br />The religious chanting and other inspirational sounds are fitting and well done.<br />All this superbly performed by London Philharmonic Orchestra and choirs of London Voices and Barnett Schools Choir.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Theyre ok.  But I do admit that they have no talent.  I just like listening them when Im bored of good stuff and need some mindless crap.
B00018D44U|4.0|If you liked her first album, then I think you will enjoy this one as well.  It has more of the jazzy, laid back songs that have become her trademark.  Unfortunately, I think this album has become a victim of her own success.  While Nora once sounded unique and refreshing, this album is a bit repetitive and lackluster.  Although she is still much different, both vocally and stylistically, from most other singers, her last album, &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; has saturated the airwaves and dulled my senses to her style of music.  Also, this album seems even more laid back than &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, if that is possible, and fails to showcase the range of her incredible voice.  Overall I like the album and recommend it.  Just don't have high expectations before you hear it and you won't be overly disappointed.
B00005A46T|5.0|First off , Slipknot is one of the most brutal bands to have ever came out period. But not only is Corey T. a freaking beast on the mic, you can actually UNDERSTAND HIS LYRICS!!!!!!! WOW ! What a concept. Now all you other metal bands who think you're so talented ...go ask anyone in the world to listen to your cd and we'll see if they can understand the words. <br />Second ..the music. Joey J. is one of my fav. drumers now. He kicks. as far as the rest of the band..they all do there part to make it such a awesome band. Slpknot helped me get thru some hard stuff in my life...my brother died of a heart attack..my mom had one too...my girlfriend of 2 yrs broke up with me and f**ked 6 guys in 4 months..but hey after listening to this cd i realized that as long as i know whats right and wrong and do my own thing.... YOU CANT TAKE MY SOUL AWAY FROM ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is one of those movies that you have to have the right frame of mind to enjoy.  While there is some light comedy in the movie, those that expect to see a laugh out loud material will be sorely disappointed.  This is a subtle movie about two lonely people in a foreign land trying to figure out what to do next in life.  The contrast between the two characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray, provides an interesting story.  Scarlett is a young woman, newly married and graduated from college while Bill is a famous actor whose prime days have passed and yet both are struggling with finding direction in their lives.  Their struggle is compounded by the fact that they are in a strange country with stark cultural differences and have indifferent spouses.  This is a movie about friendship and making the most out of a tough situation.  It reminds me a bit of &quot;The Big Chill&quot; but without the ensemble cast. If you don't expect a roaring comedy, or to be blown away because of its Oscar nominations, then I think you will enjoy this movie.  It is both heartwarming and original, which is hard to come by these days.
B0000BWVCM|1.0|I give this movie one star for the sheer, laughable entertainment value of Nightcrawler, the blue catholic demon with a tail. He is by far one of the most ridiculous characters I've ever seen! Do not not waste your money or your time on this DVD.
0553213105|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read!  Definitely in the top 10!  It is a book of real life drama and intense love.  I couldn't wait to see if Miss Elizabeth Bennet would drop some of her prejudices or if Mr. Darcy would look thru his pride or if Miss Jane Bennet would end up with the one she loved.<br />This book is excellence in writing and in overall story!  It was a book that I will read again!!  Beyond doubt!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This DVD blew me away. It was such a vast improvement that I almost think of it as a different movie. The extra material is great too, of course, but the extra scenes really made the movie. There is a great flashback scene with Faramir, Boromir, and their father, Denethor, that was very important. In my opinion, it should have been kept in the theatrical version! Anyway... this is an awesome DVD, and a great value as well. I can't wait till the extended ROTK!
B00018D44U|3.0|So I finally had time to listen to Norah Jones' album. ... umm, a lil' bit country ... a little bit like the previous one but with different accompaniment.<br />It's alright ... I like some of the tracks (2, 5, 13) and there are a few blues piano bits here and there that remind me of jazz, but, well, too bad for me it's *not* jazz.  I'm too much of a jazz fan (from hot jazz, to bop, to latin, and vocals in those genres) to be satisfied with what Norah Jones has been doing with her albums so far.<br />A lot of people like what the direction she's taken but I'd love to hear her try to push more and sing something that really swings.  I think that's what I felt about Come Away With Me; great voice, fresh (but lite) instrumentals, but kinda sleepy and not really groovy or swinging.  If she showed that side to her music (which she could) then that would be cool.  But I wonder what all those lite music fans would think!  There must be a ton of them to boost this album to number one in sales on this website.<br />Aside: You get to hear Dolly and some fun guitar work on track 7.
B00018D44U|2.0|I was very dissappointed in this much anticipated release.  Each piece on \\"Come Away With Me\\" was distinct and memorable and could stand on its own merit.  On this CD, the selections blend together, in a not very appealing way.  I found myself getting bored and skipping to the next track to see if there was a pleasant surprise waiting.  Usually, there was not.  The tone of the CD was rather downbeat.  \\"Sunrise\\" is nice, but even though I'm a Dolly Parton fan, I did not like the duet \\"Creepin' In\\".  There was just too much sameness on this CD, and nothing seized my attention or emotions.  Also missing was much of Norah's distinctive piano playing.  My recommendation is to stay with the first CD and wait for the third.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Welcome to the world of Kanye West, The College Dropout!  First off Kanye is one of the best producers in the game, he even makes the Neptunes look like crap (as of late).<br />Second off Kanye is CRAZY, I mean look at the cover....A BEAR!  But that's a good thing that he is &quot;crazy&quot; that means something new and fresh to the rap game.<br />For some reason if you didn't notice, Kanye has a vendetta against college. It seems like through all &quot;21&quot; tracks he dogs college expectations and how it's overrated. <br />Pros:  Produces every track, Slow Jamz is the cutt, makes a crack about girls on Blackplanet, some funny skits (keyword: some), the special guest from Jay-Z to Talib Kweli, the personal lyrics, first successful producer/rapper<br />Cons:  Some of production is not up to par, some of the songs have bad choruses, too many skits (for some people), too much dissing of college I mean it's overrated at times but c'mon<br />Besides that Kanye seems to outshine his guest apperances and with his &quot;Slick Rick/Jay-Z&quot; type flow he may &quot;Drop Out&quot; of producing too rap!  No pun intended!  Hope you enjoy!  PEACE OUT FOLKS!!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is overall a good album. Great songs accompanied with good music. But if you like this album you would really love Braden Blake's A Year In Pajamas. Similar but just overall better. Great lyrics and very easy to listen to over and over again. Purchase and enjoy!
0312263120|1.0|I heard people raving about \\"DaVinci Code\\", so when a friend lent me \\"Digital Fortress\\" by the same author, to while away some brutal hours flying cross country, I was pleased.  <br />Brown owes me 6 hours of my life back. You don't want to read it; so accept that I have sacrificed for you. This book is thoroughly predictable and will only appeal to the connoisseur of fine comic books. The plot is swiss cheese. The protagonist is presented as having an IQ of 170, but certainly doesn't behave that way. (maybe the scale is different for women). Dan Brown doesn't have the slightest grasp of digital security, hardware or programming and is obviously too lazy to do the homework. The characters consistently act contrary to logical motivations, and depend on the most wildly, unlikely coincidences to advance the story. I have thoughtfully included the following `Tips to the Author'<br />Nobody is going to lie on their back and hand-solder a chip to a motherboard in a \\"mainframe\\". <BR>You don't put a silencer on a revolver. There is a gap between the cylinder and the barrel where gas (and sound) comes out, rendering said silencer useless.<BR>Once a zillion people download a program, putting a new rev of it on a website isn't going to spontaneously change all existing copies.<BR>If a person created an \\"unbreakable encryption\\" scheme, wouldn't you find it odd that his secret e-mails would be sent in clear-text? No, that wouldn't raise a red flag for your garden-variety NSA bighead.<BR>I would guess that somebody in IT there at NSA might suggest that a TAPE BACKUP for the giant `databank' might be a swell idea.<BR>Silicon, Germanium, etc. doesn't really burn very well.<BR>If the Dig Fortress program was encrypted, how could the GAUNTLET program even detect the evil `mutation strings'?<BR>How useful is it to provide backup power to your front-end terminals, and then leave the only access doors to them unpowered.<BR>Its VLSI not VSLI. Very Scale Large Integration, doesn't make much sense, does it?<BR>Ad naseaum....<br />I could go on, but I'm bored. Take my word for it, the book is riddled with them. All in all, I would give this book a half of a Star; and that's only because the ring being a red herring was rather original. But then the underlying advocacy is about as subtle as a Bruce Cockburn song: NSA, BAD!!! Privacy Rights, GOOD!!!, so half the distance to the goal line - back to a quarter Star.<BR>I would recommend that you run from this book. Run fast. Run far. Don't look back. Oddly enough, some people LIKED this book, but then `Three's Company' stayed on for like ten years. Most likely the same people.<br />P.S. so `without wax' translates to Sincerely? Gee, that was compelling; thanks, Paul Harvey. And the other `secret code' at the end.. no one cares what it means.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin is an amazingly talented artist, who will be around for many years to come!  Buy this CD, you will not be dissappointed!
B00013PHGS|3.0|... Ok, now, with that off my chest, let's talk about Talkie Walkie.  Like most Air fans, I was rather disappointed with 10,000 HZ Legend and really wanted a Moon Safari part 2. Talkie Walkie gives us a hybrid of The Virgin Suicides soundtrack and pieces of that great Moon Safari record. For starters they went back to adding simple and heavy atmosphere on this record. They lost the useless collaborations seen on 10,000, and made the most of the electronic landscapes they so beautifully create.  There are at least 4 definite bangers on here. Starting with the lead single, Cherry Blossom Girl, a beautiful dramatic tune with coy female vocals and melodic guitars. The third track on the album is probably my favorite one. Titled Run, its a bit more futuristic in scope, a bit more fun as well with this robotic vocal that repeats the chorus, run run run run run run run. It just sounds really great when cranked up to 11. I was very happy with the inclusion of Alone In Kyoto, the song Air wrote for the film Lost In Translation. Like the film, the music has a way of setting a mood and transforming the atmosphere with it's lush yet minimal arrangement. I also like Surfin On A Rocket, a mid-tempo, single-to-be, that in ways, harks back to the always great, Sexy Boy. The rest of Talkie Walkie is equally up to the task and makes this one great piece of work.  In 1998, I listed Air's Moon Safari, #1 on my best of the year list (check out my lists in the listmania area for all my best of lists) Since then, they've missed the target a few times but always manage to produce enough quality tunes to keep me buying. Talkie Walkie is not only a return to form, but one of the best electronic records I've heard this year.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Don't underestimate Interpol and their potential. They will steadily grow and develop into a band with much to say in the coming years. They do sound overwhelmed by their post-punk influences, yet they are learning to form their own identity as a rock band and voice in this world. Every band has to be inspired by other artists, and it is that mimicry that sets them on their journey. Great tracks include &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Roland&quot; both of which are irresistably honest and playful. My favorite track, by far is &quot;NYC.&quot; That song is one of the smartest, most insightful songs I've heard since U2 released their single, &quot;Stay (Far Away, So Close)&quot; in 1993. Overall, this record is strong, very strong for a debut album, and that is saying a mouthful. If you love post-punk rock from the 80's, then you will love the continuation of those themes and rhythms in &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights.&quot; It's solid and genuine.
B000088E6D|5.0|I can't get Michael's &quot;Sway&quot; out of my mind!!!  Love how he covers everything from Queen's &quot;Crazy Little Thing...&quot; to Van's &quot;Moondance&quot; to Frank's &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;.  He's the new Sinatra for the 30-somethings!  Thoroughly enjoy it!
B000059H99|5.0|&quot;Rocky&quot; was the first film I ever remember seeing, and the one movie I saw over and over again as I grew up during the early 80's &quot;Rocky&quot;-craze. No other film has been able to match its dialogue and wit. I'm as old as this film and I've loved it unceasingly, unwaveringly since I was three-years-old. It's fascinating to take in the stereotypical, yet unique characters Sly Stallone managed to create as the film's screenwriter. They are all truly unforgettable as are their truly human qualities. This movie forces you to ask yourself the question, &quot;would I have the courage to take a shot at my dream, if I got the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity?&quot; Rocky shows you that he faced his fears, went the distance, and how that paid off in the end, not with a championship title, but with the satisfaction of not settling for less and intending to make something of himself and his life. It's only fitting that there be a sequel, yet it's not nearly as magical as the original film. The choreographed fight scene at the end is pure artistry. All other subsequent fight-films have had to keep up with the standard set by &quot;Rocky.&quot; Own it to laugh, cry, and be inspired to be a better you.
B00007M5CO|4.0|You've probably heard people say in response to something, &quot;mmmmmm, that 's interesting.&quot; Pretty much that is the response you will have after listening to this disc that it is not tremendous on either side of the spectrum but good nontheless. It is much like Gotan Project's &quot;La Revancha Del Tango.&quot; Comparing the two, since they seem to be the only  groups exploring this side of the tango(a mixture of electronica elements, genre's and sub-genre's) I'd have to tip my hat to BTC mostly because of the production skills of Santoalalla( most everything he touches is gold) that results in a slick musical stew like some type of noveau French cuisine. This music is extremely relaxing with a sort of don't wake me up from this musical  trip to lands unknown. In other words it is a little spacey but has just enough tango to keep your heart ticking, head swaying and wondering what curve is coming next on this musical journey. It is very eclectic and that is what makes it so interesting, there is that word again. There are dark passages along the way but overall this is a bright addition to the ever expanding electronica field. It many respects it is an entry into chill out music. When it is more upbeat, (check out the editorial review) remember the music is all over the map, it is as fresh as any dance music out there. Maybe it is my being partial to the female voice but when they cut into &quot;Perfume&quot;it sends my heart a reeling. The result is a song that sounds intoxicating. The bandeon throughout keeps the tango vibe, but the piano work binds it all together for a surreal atmospheric experience; it is like sipping a martini at the milky way cafe as a seductress approaches  and you offer her a rose  and she places it between her teeth and smiles an invitation to tango. To really capture all the sounds that are weaved together this disc should be experienced with headphones a todo volumen(at full volume). There is enough variety on this disc to keep it from being repetitive as the various time changes, pacing and styles give it a flow that doesn't leave you bored. It is a fine example of  the meshing of the old and the new for something very interesting, there's that word again. It won't blow you away but you will think it is , you guessed it , interesting.t from being repetitive as the various time changes, pacing and styles give it a flow that doesn't leave you bored. It is a fine example of  the meshing of the old and the new for something very interesting, there's that word again. It won't blow you away but you will think it is , you guessed it , interesting.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD is truly a classic 1st CD.  Maybe not a classic in terms of all CDs, but it marks a new era of hip-hop-where you can have a conscience, and still wanna make money.  Best song on the CD is absolutely &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; with Jay-Z.  The lyrics of this song are awesome.   It speaks of excellence through perseverance, and dedication. The spirituallity throughout this CD is very refreshing in a world of &quot;Lil' John&quot;-class rappers out there now.   It's great to see a guy from the Chi make good.<br />Con: The skits where bashing college degrees way too much.  It went beyond satirical, and presented to be a bit more malicious-almost baseless.
B00004XONN|2.0|not that i despise Kid A by any means, but after OK Computer came out, it seems to me that Thom Yorke could take a dump in a box and everyone would mark it &quot;brilliant.&quot;
0783229526|3.0|From the man who brought us the surreal, yet hauntingly real, world of \\"Brazil\\" comes the drug-induced world of \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\\"  Terry Gilliam uses his craft to mimic this world and help the viewer feel as if he or she is part of this world.  As a result, this film appears disconnected and bizarre.  Don't worry.  It's supposed to be that way.<br />In route to a writing project, Johnny Depp plays Hunter S. Thompson, aka Duke Raoul, who with his lawyer, played by an initially unrecognizable Benecio Del Toro, binge and document their way through the experience.  Is it the drugs or is it Las Vegas?  Both seem to feed of each other.<br />The film tells us that somehow the adages and directions given in the 60s seem to have misled us somehow.  Not an anti-drug movie, the movie merely points out that there seems to be a step missing in the search for truth.<br />I would only recommend this to a patient viewer.  It does take a while to connect the ideas.
B0001AP12G|5.0|get this cd..no questions asked its up there with the black albym..there is not one bad song and it has showstopping beats with ridiculous rhyming by of cours Kanye West..and others such as ludacris, jay-z, common, talib kweli, and twista.
0804106304|5.0|Written from the point of view of a true Chinese born American, Amy Tan reveals the reality about immigrating to a new country and living amongst diverse cultures in the book The Joy Luck Club. Four separate stories twist around each other about four girls and their mothers who came from China's hardships a couple of years back. The four mothers met through weekly games of mahjong, gossiping and sharing their unique stories with each other. As each realized how many times they could have lost hope, they named their weekly visits \\"The Joy Luck Club\\". Tan unravels each family secret deliberately, making each one different, but just as sophisticated. She portrays the difficulty each girl goes through as they struggle from the grasps of their culture and tradition to become an American.<BR>Born as a Chinese-American myself, there are times when I feel like I can never fit in perfectly anywhere. With English constantly at the tip of my tongue, I'm taken as a foreigner in Asian countries. However, in any Western country, my black hair and dark eyes Asian features immediately reveals my identity. Through Tan's book, I have a new perception that living a diverse life means keeping an open heart to fit into foreign cultures, but to never abandon our own traditions. I can celebrate Christmas, the Fourth of July, speak English, and listen to American pop singers, but I must not ever forget how to speak, read, or write my Chinese dialect, the Lunar calendar and it's wonderful holidays. <BR>Tan wrote beautifully, being incredibly sensitive with her descriptions of the contrast between two very different cultures. Those who are open-minded to our diverse world would thrive inside these stories. Those with mixed backgrounds would be filled with complete understanding. Those who are Chinese born American must pick up this book sometime along their own path.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Man, this movie would have been somewhat OK if I had ABSOLUTELY NO PRIOR KNOWLEDGE of Michael Alig.  Unfortunately this is not the case.  I have many many tapes from talk shows where the \\"club kids\\" made appearances on including one rare Donahue appearance and scores of their appearances on Geraldo, including the ones (I believe there were 2) where \\"Angel\\" made an appearance. Plus I've also seen the documentary version of Party Monster where James St. James recreated the times and follies of Alig with the help of the same directors who made the newer release.<br />Frankly the documentary is MILES better than the Culkin movie, but the extra actor interviews and Alig interviews make both movies must-rentals, preferably at the same time so you can compare the differences.<br />Some of the finer points:<BR>1. James St. James is portrayed brilliantly in the documentary, but appears as some sort of vemonous faggot in the new film... This is obviously helped along by James' terrible screenplay himself who from what I can gather is a trust fund kiddie who just happened to be in the right place at the right time.<BR>2. Culkin can obviously act, but sometimes it seems like he's STILL using the same Home Alone type of overacting in order to portray Alig. Granted that Alig was himself over-the-top, but the difference is noticeable in the first 10 minutes enough to get on any historical buff's nerves.<BR>3. Wilmer Valderrama plays Superstar DJ Keoki incredibly well, but the rest of the major star cast is somewhat limited... possibly since the real people were sort of lackluster in comparison to Alig and James in real life... Chloe Sevigny shows only a limited sense of the tragic Gitsie's real persona, Natasha Lyonne seems like she was put there for comic relief in her portrayal of Brooke, and Dylan McDermott's portrayal of Peter Gaitan is stilted.<br />KUDOS TO:<BR>1. Marilyn Manson as Christina, plays the part beautifully... One has to wonder if he actually knew the long-deceased drag queen in his early days of east coast exploration.<BR>2. Diana Scarwid as Elke Alig, is virtually indistinguishable from Alig's natural mother.<BR>3. Wilson Cruz as Angel Melendez, so why does Cruz always play the tragic gay?  People want to know.<br />Final thoughts...<BR>While I recommend the movie, I would much rather reccommend the documentary first for the real story (and better portrayal)... If you like that, then rent the movie itself for the brilliant extras. The extras for the movie alone made waiting for this DVD's release well worth the wait.
B0000033TE|4.0|Before I start this review, I'd like to express one of my pet peeves about reviews on Amazon. Why must 10 people give a history of the band, when I can find that information (in a more accurate form) on the band's website? I know some of you love to show off your knowledge of a band or artist, but save it for the fan message boards. Write a review here and spare us from scrolling though 500 words of what you think you know.<br />Now, on with the show. This album is amazing in its composition, production and presentation. The re-master is crisp and powerful. This is a prime example of a band experimenting and taking chances. On this album, the payoff is huge. Karnevil 9 alone is worth the price of the CD. To hear such great musicians pushing their talents to the extreme limits is something that we lack in the music of today. If you have the attention span of a flea, this album will not be your cup of tea. If you must have your music spoon-fed to you with a large dose of &quot;catchy choruses&quot;, then move on. But if you are like me, and you enjoy music that breaks boundaries, pick up this CD and Tarkus as well.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is what hip hop needs! Beats and lyrics are great.  Each song has a new vibe.  Kanye's debut is undenyably a classic!!
B000007491|5.0|Many people like Supertramp up to Breakfast in America before they became 'too commercialised', and others like the Breakfast sound and not the earlier albums. Personally I would like to scrap both of those opinions, and say that I think ALL of their albums range from extremely good to sublime. But this first one stands out in my record collection of them. Surely, Maybe I'm A Beggar, Aubade and Other Birds of Prey bring tears to my eyes; and Nothing to Show and It's A Long Road are excellent rockers. As always, the falsetto of Roger Hodgson is hauntingly beautiful, leaving a soaring feeling long after you've turned off your hi-fi. Rick Davies does magic on the keyboards, Bob Miller's Led Zeppelin drumming is fantastic, and Richard Palmer's bass adds perfectly tuned low notes to the ensemble. All in all this is Supertramp at its finest - at times a Floyd/Zeppelin sound, mixed with their later sound: a FANTASTIC album. Another few albums I would recommend for the melodious sound are Even In The Quietest Moments, Crime of the Century and Famous Last Words, as well as Breakfast in America of course. Long live Supertramp!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye delivers through this fine album. I am a huge Kweli fan, which drew me to Kanye seeing how he dropped the beat for Get By. Personally I expected the beats to be incredible and the lyrics to be shallow but clever at best. However, it is really the other way around. The beats range from mediocre to excellent and the lyrics are surprisingly consistent, catchy and clever. I bought the CD for like 10 bucks and for that, it is no doubt worth it. If you like underground appeal with commercial quality, check this out.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is not for the faint-of-heart.  If you can stomach some violence and get past the gore, it's a as awesome movie, with such an interesting plot that you will want to watch it again right afterwards.  It follows the plot of the Chuck Palahniuk book pretty closely, and Ed Norton and Brad Pitt do some great acting.  But beware, it's pretty weird....
B00005AAFS|5.0|After Sehnsucht, I didn't think that Rammstein could get better but they have proven me wrong.  I thought that after the Live Aus Berlin concert in 1999 (which I was there) was the best.  Mutter is a story about Till Lindemanns mother and is the reason for a fetal baby on the cover.  My favorite songs are Rein, Raus (which translates to In, Out) Zwitter (which translates to Hermaphrodite) and of course my favorite, Ich Will.  And that means I Want.  Anyway, this CD is so good I take it with me everywhere.  Also, I'd like to say how hard it is for a band, especially a hard rock band, from Germany, to make it as big as they did.  It's unheard of.  Maybe this will also enlighten the world into thinking that the German Rock and Industrial scene is alive and well.  Danke Chen, Rammstein!
0688170528|5.0|I was catching up on some summer reading this past year and was striking out terribly, until I came to this book. I had never heard of Jodi Picoult, but I'm terribly happy I found her. From page 1 the book hooks you and doesn't let go. The pace, the plot, the point of view are all engrossing, but the best part is the characters. I found myself identifying with them in their heartaches, losses, and triumphs. I found myself wanting to talk to them, my mind constantly screaming, &quot;if you could only see!&quot; Even though I spent the summer desperately searching for a good book, when I found it in this one, the previous disapointments vanished.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The first time I remember seeing Michael Chiklis in something, he played John Belushi in the grotesque film version of WIRED about 15 years ago.  I was a fan of Belushi and liked Bob Woodward's book but that movie was obscene.  I felt bad for Chiklis because he did a great job but the production was darn-near evil in its approach to Belushi.<br />Actor's careers can be killed over messes like that.<br />But how sweet it must be now!  I was thrilled for Chiklis when I heard he'd come out of nowhere to win the Emmy for THE SHIELD.  Then I saw THE SHIELD on DVD from beginning to end.  Wow.  This is a show that lives up to its hype.  From a single gunshot in the first episode, I felt like I was in a whole new world here.  This is a tough, brutal show but expertly crafted and wildly unpredictable.<br />The characters are perfectly cast and each feels real with a life of his or her own--and every demon that comes with the job.  I was also happy to see CCH Pounder in a great role because I always seemed to see her in smaller, unsympathetic roles before.<br />I can pay this series one of the highest compliments of a TV show: There's only one thing ahead of the characters--the writers!
B000089RVX|4.0|First, I honestly have no idea how Evanescence got labled 'metal'. It's apparent from their first released track that they're far from it. Anyone who can honestly lable them metal from 'Bring me to life' deserves to buy this album, and be seriously disappointed that it's not a 'hard core metal band'. I've heard some say goth, also. Singing about death and pain makes you goth now? I can go on and on about how sickening these lables are, but this isn't the place for that.<BR>This album is a great album, plain and simple. Amy Lee's vocals are just amazing. She is a very talented woman. The only fault I can find in her is that she tends to hold back the full power of her voice. It's almost as if in places where she should be belting out this incredible note, she clenches her teeth and forces it back into her throat making it sound sort of muffled. But this is their debut album, and you can't expect the first to be a 5 star masterpiece. I seriously hope they pick up and create a second album that makes this one look bad.<BR>Honestly, aside from the vocals and the lyrics, this band is nothing extrodinary. The lyrics are at times so very simple, but it's the simplicity that brings them close to heart. The pain of a love one losted('My Immortal', The vanity of society('Everybody's fool'). In all tracks you can hear the emotional pain and torment from life. In nearly each of them you can find some line(if not all) to relate to some point in your life. If you can't then you're very lucky indeed. <BR>This albums if layered with great lyrics, wonderful vocals, beautiful piano solos, sometimes 'heavy' or haunting guitar riffs, and just this general sense of emotional darkness. It's a great album, really. At times you just have to overlook the parts that aren't so good, and focus on the rest. It's all a matter of taste, but personally, I'd rather listen to music that makes me feel something.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Despite the queerish cover, pink CD, and the god-awful promotion idea of handing out &quot;free textbooks&quot; which consist of a cover of kanye west holding a back-pack (come on dog, I'm not 12 anymore) which I found to be more of an embarsement then an actual gift.<BR> <BR>But I guess this all defines &quot;Content Matters&quot; - because the CD is great. After listening to this entire CD, I come to find out that &quot;Through the Wire&quot; is probably my least favorite song - there are quite a few tracks that totally outshine that track. First, the skits are funny - one of the few CD's were skits are a must-not-skip. Another great plus is this CD is not over-loaded with guest appearences; it has enough to keep things interesting, and to keep it from an album takeover of  abunch of 'nobody' rappers. &quot;We Dont Care&quot; got that soul-funk beat; the speed-up vocals that you hear from &quot;Through The Wire&quot; is all over this track. &quot;All Falls Down&quot; is the top 3 in this CD - Kanye surprisingly holds his own in this track - flow and lyrically wise. &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; a pro-religion track? A controversial track no doubt - one of the best beats on the CD. After that song, it molds into &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; which is one of my favorites - not because of Jay-Z, but the beat is mysteriously emotional, 'specially during the 2nd verse - oh, and speed-up vocals are also present. &quot;Get Em High&quot; is not exactly one of my favorites, the beat is average and the rappers are average; yes, even Kweli, who I really don't care for. &quot;Slow Jams&quot; - self explainatory. The School Spirit skits are great - talking about the over-emphasis of college education - controversial? absolutely - and thats what's odd about this album, its not the political controversy that most rappers/rockers take stabs at, but it's just family life controversy, like school and religion, drugs and just life in general - it's a breathe of fresh air. Then comes my favorite track in the entire album, &quot;Two Words&quot; - the beat is dark and bouncy, speed-vocals are used conservative enough to not make it annoying - but the presents of Mos Def really makes this track awesome. Mos Def is definitaly a rapper. I wish he wouldv'e rapped the entire track, he's that good. Then Comes &quot;Through The Wire&quot; - again, self explainatory. &quot;Family Bussiness&quot; is a slow-jazzy beat which talks about family life. Kanye really trying to catch the soulful feeling with this track, I think he does a good job of it. &quot;Last Call&quot; is the dragged out outro, not exactly the best way to end the album, but it doesn't matter.<br />In conclusion, I think Kanye's debut album couldv'e been better in some spots, but it's defitinaly tight. Even though Kanye in himself is not that great of a rapper, he does kinda grap your attention with his lyrics, which can be thoughtful or funny. Kanye has a signature production style, with high-pitched vocals during the choruses, and the more use of dry-handclaps instead of snares. The album depth isn't that deep, but deep enough to make it feel like your getting something out of the music when your listening to it. Overall just a balanced album. Kanye played a safe with his debut album, and I think it turned out for the better.
B0001AP12G|5.0|awesome cd.  The beats were unbelievable and the rhymes matched them.  Nothin better from the ROC.
B000050HTO|1.0|my best friend recently both this cd at a used cd store for a mere dollar.he hated it so much he gave it to me.i love this cd,it's great for a laugh.this guy has the funniest voice i ever heard and even funnier he and millions of people thinks he can actually sing and to think this guy is considered a legend in the music biz.some people are stupid enough to buy anything and nobody thanks you more than mr.dylan.
B00013EY7Q|3.0|Rather a let-down, this \\"Lost in Translation.\\"I saw \\"Groundhog Day,\\" and went out of my mind over the movie, and Bill Murray. (I had always thought Murray a competent actor, but didn't love him until \\"Groundhog.\\")<br />I watched the VHS of \\"Translation\\" the first weekend it was out. That avalanche of critical praise for this movie had me almost \\"trembling\\" as I popped the video in the recorder.<br />THE WRITING WAS POOR. Much of it seemed to revolve around jokes about the Japanese confusing \\"L\\" with \\"R.\\" Real original, huh? Johanssen's character did not act like a Yale graduate, not at all. And I did not think her performance was anything special. Adequate, not award-worthy.<br />Mostly, this is about the \\"drinking, smoking, going to crazy parties,\\" culture, not the introspective, adult, intelligent film I thought it was going to be.<br />I watched it twice, the second time fast-forwarding over the crazy party scenes, and it played a little better. I do think Bill Murray was very good, both dramatically and especially comedically, but nonetheless, this is nowhere near an Academy award winning performance.<br />A very average movie. But I did like lots of what I saw of Tokyo -- the blend of the pastoral and the high-tech, like Central Park in the heart of Manhattan!
B00005Q3KC|5.0|if there is a better female vocalist out there than andrea corr,i have yet to hear it,this womans voice is just beautiful as you already know if you own this cd.this is perhaps the best greatist hits cd i have ever heard,all of the corrs major hits are included on this disc,such as breathless,irresistible and runaway.my favorite tracks are runaway and the right time.every song on this album is great.this album also  has a lot of variety on it,from traditional irish tunes,ballets to all out rockin tunes.the corrs plays it all.i think this cd is a safe bet to purchase,it's hard not to like the music offered on this disc.
B00013EY7Q|2.0|THEY SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!<br />Actually, it didn't put me to sleep - parts of the soundtrack were too noisy, and I was too hyped by my SHOCK that this mediocre movie has received such a plethora of critical praise.<br />Like Johanssen's character, I did chuckle at most of what Murray said. But I was almost immediately struck by the patronizing attitude of the movie toward people of another culture, and I'm a middle-of-the-road type person, not an extreme PC type.<br />There is nothing at all special about this movie.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|A few years ago I saw a newspaper cartoon depicting a cow on a psychiatrist's couch as the shrink tells it; \\"I don't know that I'd call you a 'mad cow'--perhaps a cow with issues.\\" The cartoon struck me as an amusing collision between 'political correctness' and an alarming medical issue. And it came back to me as I listened to this album. It has a number of weakness at least adequately balanced out by strengths on the other side. For one thing, it's almost a foregone conclusion that at least 90% of concept albums released are going to be a cliche. That's why hardly anyone does them anymore. And the few artists who did bring it off did it so far back that they're classics. And a classic is by definition that rare work that can overcome the fact that it's now an anachronism. But Neil uses the fact that he's always been a supreme iconoclast to get this album out of the quagmire of cliche. Another thing that makes it notable is that Neil's jam-band approach to his work defies the rule that says a concept album is all about the lyrics. So we wind up with the extremely rare concept album where half of the songs are about ten minutes long a la Neil Young, but the lyrics of each song are all built on a common theme as with a concept album. That would be great, were it not for the fact that having only Neil on guitar makes for a sound with a lot of holes in it with Ponch Sampedro's name on them. The power trio approach is only doable when your six-stringer is adept enough to handle that subtle back-and-forth switch between lead and rhythm guitar with finesse. But Neil is basically a rhythm player of folk roots who functions as an \\"acting lead\\"--that does not spell \\"Godsmack\\" by any stretch of the imagination. That's why I call the current lineup the Horse With Issues--a lot of the essence has been left out. And what's really annoying is the absence of lyrics in an \\"insert card\\" that's really a book. All those pages with Neil thinking out loud, and you still have to do a Yahoo search to get the words!oo search to get the words!
B00018D44U|4.0|On her sophomore effort, Norah Jones proves that her success is no fluke.  She stepped out of the box and out of the comfort zone we are all accustomed to and infused new rhythm to her music.  Not a fan of country, I was not really thrilled with the country sound of some of the songs, but quickly have come to like them.  I cannot remember the last time I actually liked a Dolly Parton song.  A strange duet combo - but it works.<br />If you are expecting more torch songs, this is probably not the CD for you.  If you are interested in listening to an artist grow, and take on new material, you won't be disappointed.  Norah has managed to defy typecasting or labeling - she is in a class all by herself.
B000000W5F|5.0|Tatto you is the best record that the Stones released in the 1980s and one of the best records they ever made. Only Beggars Banquet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street (and possibly Some Girls) are better than this. But this said, Tatto You is just an extraordinary record. It's inspired, it's energetic, it's absolutely great.<BR>The record - now available in cd- was originally divided into a fast A-side and a slow B-side. And there were really nice licks on both sides. The list includes neighbours, worried about you, no use in crying, black limousine, waiting on a friend. But most of the songs in this record were overshadowed by start me up, the last classic written by Jagger and Richards. Start me up became a great hit from the beginning and it has been a permanent features in all the concerts that the Stones have played in the past 20some years.<BR>It's one of the nicest gem produced by the Stones.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I am beyond furious at Buena Vista for disregarding their buying public and yanking this dvd practically out of our hands so close to the release date without a reasonable explanation.  All I'm hearing are rumours about why it was pulled, and I'm not sure I believe any of them.  I did also read on Tim Burton's website that there is a new release date of April 27.  Can anyone else substantiate this?  I'd like to believe that, but at this point I'm not sure I'll believe anything.
0393317552|5.0|This is a book which provides a well thought out and well argued case for his thesis of the development of historical development.<br />It is not simply broad brush strokes, though his thesis is relatively easy to summarize: 1. basic east west layout of Eurasia (diversty of animals and plants thus allowed to spread), 2. rise of complex concentrated societies (thus development of competing ideas and greater immunity to diseases). Yet it is not too bound to specific historical or cultural detail, though each concept is first analized in specific examples (sort of test cases) before being applied more generally.<br />I think this forces the reader to be more critical and puts any discussion on a more serious footing, since we are forced to discuss not just opinions, but facts and very often deductions based on those facts. This book cannot be easily dismissed and I hope will provide for deeper discusson into our past and our future.<br />One little note. I was surprised when he wrote of kleptocrats gaining support through ideology or religion that he did not mention the etymology of the word &quot;religion&quot;, which literally comes from &quot;rex&quot; and &quot;ligio&quot;: bound to one's king. Providing further confirmation of his analysis of its role.
B00005JMGL|5.0|i think that this is the best edition of peter pan ever done everything in this movie was wonderful just wonderful,the special effects are great, the cast jeremy sumpter defenetly fit in his character and wendy 2 she's a great actress 2, u will think that this just another kids movie,but its so great that i recomend it for every body  4 kids 4 teenage for adults hey i'm 16 an i just love it.. and i will love to buy it when it comes in dvd......
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie blew me away when I first saw it. The drawings (90% still drawn by hand and not with the help of a computer) are very realistic and the characters are not too Japanese-looking, which is kinda strange sometimes.<BR>It is a fantasy story with Gods and Demons and sometimes reminded me a little of the Lord of the Rings, so if you like that kind of storylines and animation this movie is a must see, it's the most impressive Japanese animation I have ever seen.<BR>Voices are done by Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver as a Queen wanting to kill the Forest Gods. <BR>The most incredible creatures are little forest 'elves', small mushroomlike creatures with revolving heads and strange sounds. <br />It is not for children! Heads and arms are shot of and it's very bloody at times, so keep your young children away. Even I was impressed by the graphic scenes.
B0001AP12G|5.0|it kind of bothers me that twista is getting all the credit for slow jamz and kanye isn't getting equal billing. anyway.. Don't sleep! kanye is one of the few artists breathing life into hip hop music. i've been tired of hip hop of late. i'm not even gonna lie, even the black album and the speakerboxxx side wasn't keeping me interested. so i was pleasantly surprised that kanye brought me back in. i can listen to the whole album nonstop. he isn't completely innovative like dre 3000 but kanye knows how to make a good hip hop record. i've been a fan of his beats for awhile but ive grown to love his flow too. he's got wit, sarcasm and intelligence that u barely see in hip hop today. support him as much as u can. buy the album
B0001A79JO|4.0|An excelent album, different, and too  much attitude,i think their shows should be amazing!!!

0140277447|5.0|I am appalled that whilst the Holocaust is so well known, the bruality of the Japanese in China remains relatively unknown to the western world.  However, this frustration pales in comparison to how appalled I am at the utterly unapologetic attitude of the Japanese government and many of its people.  While not all Japanese are to blame, and many are willing to confront their dark past, others (like some of the reviewers for this book) go to such absurdity as to argue that the Nanking Massacre is a hoax created by the Americans to divert attention from American \\"atrocities\\" against the Japanese.  Ask any of the elder residents of Nanking.  Hundreds and thousands of people are lying?  These people who deny the massacres are no different from neo-Nazis who deny the occurance of the holocaust.  Many Japanese \\"scholars\\" argue that the actual number of people killed at Nanking is much lower, perhaps in the 10,000's range.  Even if this were true (which I don't believe), I ask this:  how many people do you have to kill before it's an atrocity?  100?  1,000?  100,000?  1 million? And here's a wakeup call:  it wasn't just Nanking!  The Japanese raped and slaughtered all over China wherever they went.  My grandfather saw with his own eyes whilst hiding in a crawlspace how the Japanese slaughtered all the men and raped all the women of his village; don't tell HIM it never happened.  What about Unit 731, where they performed horrific medical experiments on live Chinese subjects?  Many of these doctors under Shiro Ishii still live!  The best estimates I've seen report over 20 million Chinese died under Japanese hands; most of them civilian.  Many Japanese continue to worship shrines of war criminals, which is no different than if Germans built a giant shrine to Hitler and his henchmen.  Is there truly justice in the world?  If Japan can get away with the one of the cruelest, most inhuman atrocities of history, then perhaps not.  I guess you really can get away with murder.  <br/>I have read Iris Chang's book, and found it to be a well-written and gripping piece of work.  It's a good read for the general public; not a dry history book but a sad recounting of the worst side of humanity.  Anyone interested in learning about one of the forgotten tragedies of history should read this book.  Particularly if you are Chinese, it is your duty to teach your children never forget what was done to us.  They can try to erase the past and forget, but we will not.  It's true that this is Chang's personal interpretation of the event, but the basic facts of the massacre (and numerous other massacres) are not disputable.  The question of WHETHER Japan has committed gruesome atrocities in China is NOT under serious acadmeic debate outside of Japan.  I know of no professor outside of Japan who would argue such heartless absurdity.
B000002H97|1.0|This album is BAD. The only good thing about this piece of garbage is &quot;Sad But True.&quot; The Cliff Burton era and ...and justice for all were awesome... but this album sucks. Metallica DID sell out and i can prove it. Back when they started, they were against fame and pop-metal music. To quote James at a show where they were in between Bon Jovi and Ratt, &quot;if you came here to see a band with eyeliner and make-up, this ain't it!&quot; That may not be the EXCACT quote... but it was something to that effect. Anyway... to proving why metallica did sell out, they used to be against MTV fame, and anti-pop. But they decided to alter their style to what was popular. They were anti-pop... but look at that &quot;popular&quot; word. POPular. anti-pop? The word pop to describe certain music came from the word POPular. They did it for the fame, the teenage girl fans, etc. <br />As much as I love Metallica(they used to be my favorite band, but now it's megadeth),i hate to say it... but this album is bad. EXCEPT SAD BUT TRUE. that song is cool. and since i love metallica, i hate to post this poem i thought up just now.<br />&quot;Metallica found that thrash was getting old,<BR>so they made the Black Album and out they sold.&quot;
B00006ZCFH|3.0|It took me a while to appreicate &quot;Mama's Gun,&quot; but eventually I grew to love it. It's one of my favorite CDs. This may be the case with &quot;Worldwide Underground.&quot; It's not bad - just different. She takes some chances. The CD also doesn't &quot;flow&quot; like her other CDs. She's definitely on a different trip this time. The one big negative for me is the instrumental reminiscent of something Rush would do (&quot;Woo&quot;). It seemed so out of place. It's hard to describe in musical terms why this CD is not that great. If you're a dedicated fan, you should pick it up. Otherwise, stick with her other three CDs.
B00006DEFA|4.0|I recognized &quot;Amadeus&quot; as a masterpiece when I first saw it in its original theatrical release. When the film came to VHS, I bought it immediately. When I recently began building my DVD library, I was at first excited to see a full-featured widescreen version of the film.<br />The only drawback to this version is that the &quot;restored footage&quot; (a/k/a deleted scenes) adds nothing to the film; in fact, it slows the film's pace significantly, frankly insults the intelligence of the viewer by assuming we didn't &quot;get it&quot; from the originally presented scenes, and includes a (thankfully brief) gratuitous nude scene.<br />This is not the first time I have been disappointed in the &quot;director's cut&quot; DVD...&quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot; was the same way. Chingachgook's final monologue in the original film gets extended far too long and loses all of its potency.<br />If the creators REALLY wanted to provide viewers with an optimal experience (and this goes for ALL DVDs released with the phrase &quot;Director's Cut&quot;), the ORIGINAL widescreen version of the film should be included on the DVD, along with the director's cut. Just as some DVDs include both the full-screen (yecchhh!) and widescreen versions, why not include an original widescreen with the director's cut?<br />Otherwise, the &quot;director's cut&quot; label ends up being just an homage to directorial ego.
B00006BXI0|5.0|Although i call The Odyssey my favorite symphony x album, this cd is right on his heals.  Featuring 9 tracks and being over an hour long, this cd is a pretty deep, bulky release by the worlds greatest progressive band, and one of the best metal bands ever.  Track one, Of Sins And Shadows, opens up the cd perfectly.  It's a pretty good rocker, pretty fast at time with a good heavy sharp main riff to the song.  Scattered throughout the song is opera like passages of people signing, pretty cool.  Allen's voice is growling on this song, will cut right through your ears.  <br />The Accolade has one of the sweetest keyboard parts in it ever at the first minut eor so of the song when it starts out.  A pretty good, little epic song.  Speaking of epics, there is the 20 minute long title track that has so many twists and turns that you'll have to listen to it at least 20 times to contain all the coolness it spits forth.  The Eyes Of Medusa is one of the best songs the fab five have recorded, the chorus of the song is nothing short of deadly.  <br />Candlelight Fantasia is the last track and the quite possibly the best way a album as ever ended, any album. This song is so good that it's worth the price of this cd alone just to hear this song.  It's very very very smooth flowing song despite the fact it goes from heavy and soft a lot.  A epic in itself, the best song on the cd, maybe even the best song they have ever written.  I cannot talk about this song enough.  Think of it has been the reason the cd was made with the other 8 songs around it just good litte bonuses.  <br />Muscially, you can't get much better folks.  Other than the The Odyssey, their heaviest guitar riffs are found in this cd.  Drums are perfect, the bass is just amazing, and allen's vocals are extremely brutal at parts (for this type of metal anyway) and at other times he sounds like the best sing ever, he can have a very beutiful, emotional voice.  One of the best singers ever.  <br />Althought i still believe that The Odyssey is a even better cd, this cd is still one of the best, second best easily.  If you go to a store and find this cd, GET IT.  If you see both The Odyssey and this one then it will be the best 30 somethings you will ever spend, that i promise you my fellow metal fiends.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Hands down one of the best shows ever written for TV or even the movie screen, I'm sure(if it ever takes flight).  After seeing the episodes in order and the ones that were never aired it looks like an even bigger mistake that Fox cancelled it.  The movie is having a tough time getting approval though.  It needs some help from all of us.  There is a website called fireflymovie.com that will let you know who to contact.  I already did.  I hope that everyone will.  So we can all enjoy the movie.
B0001AP12G|4.0|It's been a while since a talented hip-hop producer has broken into the mainstream as an emcee. In the underground, there are a few artists who work behind the boards that also rhyme. RZA, of Wu-Tang fame, is probably the best known producer/emcee in hip-hop, and rightfully so. MF Doom does both remarkably well, and while Madlib is definitely a better producer than a rapper, he holds his own when he picks up a mic. Roc-A-Fella's Kanye West has received much praise over the last few years for his own brand of unique production for such heavyweights as Jay-Z and Nas. Sped-up soul samples and smooth jazz elements are his trademark, and it's true he wasn't the first to speed up vocal samples, he's certainly the producer who's made the best use of them in recent years. Kanye has always written rhymes, even though his big break came as a producer. His solo debut is entitled College Dropout, set to drop on February 10th, and it's without a doubt the most anticipated release of early 2004. <br />Track Listing and Ratings <br />1. Intro <BR>2.

Last Call (*****) <br />Roc-A-Fella Records has many rappers signed to their label, but with the exception of its founder and CEO Jay-Z and the hardcore duo of M.O.P., they aren't really a camp of strong lyricists. Styleover substance has been prevalent on albums dropped by Roc members in the past, but surprisingly (and then again, not so) Kanye West is a talented rhymer. Admittedly, his rhymes aren't very complex -- you're not going to find crazy multis on College Dropout like you would on an AZ record and his vocabulary isn't as expansive as Pac', for instance. However, that doesn't mean Kanye isn't an engaging emcee, for he undoubtedly is.
B00018HU4U|1.0|This album is underwhelming. Jones's fine voice that was so great on her first album is overly &quot;helped&quot; by her backup singers. Yes, the venerable Dolly Parton was okay on &quot;Creepin' In&quot;, but Norah needs little, if any, vocal assistance at any time or on any song. Also, there was not enough of her piano, except on Track 13, &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;. But worst of all, her songwriting seems to have gone quite lukewarm. Her band is fine, but after all it's her name on the front cover. After the masterpiece of &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;, this second album gives me the feeling that she left without us. Frankly, I want my money back.
B00018D44U|5.0|I liked Come Away With Me, but this one is even better, more diverse, each subsequent cut a surprise.  The tone of many naysayers here feels suspicious to me, as if their cynicism can't accept that a talented performer can top herself after so much inmmediate success.  Maybe I'm wrong.  But there's no denying Jones' talent or how enjoyable this CD is.
B00007FOMP|3.0|The song &quot;What's Going On&quot; is ok. When people ask me, &quot;What's Going On?&quot; I respond by saying &quot;'What's Going On?' Do I look Like Marvin Gaye to you?&quot;
1582432678|5.0|It's the first time in many years I haven't been able to put a book down....and since I've finished it, the story and the feelings the novel evoked within me has lingered.  I had never heard of Lionel Shriver before, but I will look for her other work in the future!!  I felt the lead character, Eva, was a well drawn, dramatically different portrait of how a parent feels when their first-born child effectively ends the family's way of life as they had known it.  Bravo, Lionel!!!!
0312995423|4.0|As a huge fan of Dan Brown and having read just about every book he has ever written I think I have earned the right to tell him that as much as I loved his story (Digital Fortress), I thought his ending could have been better.  That being said I would still happily recommend everyone read not just this book but all of DAN BROWN'S Books, they're terrific!
B0001AP12G|5.0|With Jay-Z leavin, Rocafella needs a new superstar to stay on top of the rap game.  When Bleek's MADE came out I liked it but I didn't find anything special about it.  I prayed that there would be Rocafella albums w/more much more depth.  Maybe the Young Gunz.  Today I went out and purchased Kanye West's debut, &quot;The College Dropout.&quot;  Wow was I shocked with the quality.  From start to end there isn't a single song bringing the CD down.  It's funny at times, inspiring at others and an overall funky fresh album.  &quot;The New Workout Plan&quot; is a creative, fun song about how the lady's can get a rich guy. &quot;We Don't Care&quot; and &quot;It All Falls Down&quot; are some of the good hits.  So don't hesitate, pick up Kanye West's debut album and see into the positive future of the Roc.
B00013EY7Q|4.0|Triple-threat Sofia Coppola (producer, writer, director) has given us a little gem with her, \\"Lost in Translation.\\"  It's a simple story:  two discontented souls with massive jet-lag, and big relationship issues, meet by happenstance in Tokyo, and provide comfort to one-another.  <BR>Within the simplicity Ms. Coppola nails jet-lag, ennui, relationship discontent, and Americans abroad with a gentle, humorous, and deft touch.  She also gets the attraction of age for youth, and vice versa, but keeps it grounded in how things could really happen, rather than slipping into middle-age fantasy.<BR>All the performances work.  Bill Murray shows something near genius, and Scarlett Johannson is lovely and effective, though she has less to do.  The supporting characters are also well drawn, and the players inhabit their roles.<BR>This is a movie that could have easily gone bad, it not only doesn't, it goes exceedingly well.  It was a pleasure to watch, and I recommend it for a mellow evening at home.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Tool since 1993. I think Maynard is a genius and one of the only true \\"artists\\" left in rock music. For those who judge APC because of Tool, don't take their opinions and let them influence yours. Tool is the \\"masculine\\" side of Maynard and A Perfect Circle is the \\"feminine\\" side of him, as he described prior to the release of Mer De Noms. And he's right. So with that said, there's no way you could compare the two at all when it's meant to be different from the get-go. It's not even Maynard's band. The concept was thought by Billy Howerdel, who also writes the music for the group. And those Tool fans complaining the album is too short.. the album is TWELVE tracks long. Opiate had six tracks, Undertow had 10 and Lateralus had 13. If that's your basis of hating the album, I guess you'd be criticizing those beloved albums of yours too. The only Tool album that had a lengthly 15 tracks was (their best) Aenima, and that's without minusing the in between song \\"skits.\\"<br />That said, \\"Thirteenth Step\\" proves APC to be the best group around now. Starting off with \\"The Package\\" which is musically wonderful and even more so lyrically. \\"Weak and Powerless\\", although a single, doesn't do what most rock groups do nowadays: Release a single that sounds different then the rest of the album just to appeal to the masses and mainstream fans and just sounds out of place on the rest of the record. They can release a single that stays true to the album and can be widely liked without changing a thing around and not losing any artistic merit. THAT right there should prove them as artists well enough.<br />\\"The Noose\\" is chilling and might be the second best track on the album. It's lyrics are powerful and Maynard reminds us why we hold him is such high regards: Spectacular song writing, eery chilling vocals, and a deep message. Such is the case on \\"Blue\\" and \\"A Stranger\\", both beautifully written and performed songs.<br />\\"The Outsider\\" reminds me of Undertow-era Tool. It's a great song and the lyrical content is somewhat humorous. (Ending with: If you choose to pull the trigger/ should your drama prove sincere/ do it somewhere FAR AWAY from here.) \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is eery, sounding like something Hannibal Lecter might listen to in between choosing victims. It's actually a cover song but is done to perfection. \\"Pet\\" is another Tool-esque song, and (not for that reason) the best song on the album, in my opinion. By the end of the album, you think back to Maynard saying on the opening track, \\"Clever got me this far.\\" It definitely has always gotten him farther, and \\"Thirteenth Step\\" continues the cycle.<br />\\"Thirteenth Step\\" should be judged by it's quality, not quantity. It's a very artful album, better then more then half the crap you'd find out there today. For those who appreciate deep, intelligent, artful music with perfect song writing and talented musicians, A Perfect Circle and anything else Maynard has been involved with is for you. For the rest who are still expecting APC to be a Tool clone, why don't you get it by now? Tool albums have always sounded different from one another, that's what makes the experience of Tool so amazing and unique. And the same goes for APC. Brilliant record as always.
B0001AP12G|5.0|The entire album is hot. The beats, the lyrics everything is positive and worthwhile. I am picky with what I listen to. Gangstarr-Moment of Truth is my favorite album of all time, but this cd finally gives me somthing else to listen to. Best Album I have bought in a few years. I listened through the whole cd every time I put it on.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is one of the best CDs since 50 Cent's Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. With amazing beats and extraordinary rhymes, West portrays perfectly the state of Hip-Hop. By using such issues as God, love, violence, and materialism, Mr. West demonstrates his amazing talent. The best songs on the album are : &quot;All Falls Down&quot; (with a Lauren Hill sample), &quot;Through the Wire&quot; (featuring a sample of Chaka Khan's &quot;Through the Fire&quot;) and of course &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; (with the Chi-town rapper Twista and comedian Jamie Foxx). It is clear that, even with his self-admitted arrogance, Kanye will be a favorite in the year of 2004 and will definitely be the most celebrated artist signed to Roc-A-Fella Records.
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album is a 4.5 rating. Meaning its very good, but misses being a classic. First the positives of this album:<BR>Kayne altough, not being a great lyricst, comes through pretty strong with excellent metahpors and a laid back flow. The production and beats on most of the songs are off the hook. The other thing that really stands out on this album is that most of the songs have a concept to them. This is not a typical &quot;hip hop&quot; album from today what has the some over used cliches and boring subject matter. Jesus Walks is a song about religion, All Falls Down is a song about hiding behind gold and glitter. My favorite verse by Kayne comes on Never let me down where he spits ridiciules metaphors: &quot;But in a land where ni--as praise Yukons and gettin paid, its gona take a lot more then coupouns to get us saved.&quot; Later on in the song he raps, &quot;But I can't complain what the accident did to my left eye.....Cause look what the accident did to Left Eye first Aaliyah now Romeo must Die&quot; Really tight lyrics. Jay-z actually appears with 2 verses on this song, but somehow Kayne actually does outshine J on this song. Family Buisness is a good concept song about his family, Last Call is how was ridiculed intially and then made it in rapping with the Roc. The other really good concept song is Spaceship where he raps about wishing he had a spaceship to escape from a bs job that pays him to little. <BR>Their is some negatives:<BR>First of all, they're are to many skits<BR>Second, at some points Kaynes flow gets extremely repetive and it becomes clear that he isn't a great mc. <BR>Also there is some songs that aren't necessarily bad, their are a few songs that are too &quot;popish&quot; for my liking, which seem out of place on this album with so many other concept songs. Overall this is a very strong album in todays hip hop world. I listen to all types of rap, from underground to mainstream. I was recently really annoyed with the direction of rap whichhas had no original direction. This album is very original and a new direction for Hip-Hop/Rap. If you like his singles you probably will like this album, he uses similar production on all of his songs. If you are looking for an album that is a different direction then the hip hop music that has come out lately, you will also probably like this. Production wise no one is f-kin with him. Lyrically, he is not the best Mc, but he is able to still give tight lyrics througout the album.<BR>4.5 rating
B00005JMJ4|3.0|On the one hand I enjoyed the touchy-feely way Murray &amp; SJ got to know one another other (I especially liked the ending myself).<br />On the other hand I found the japanese stereotypes a bit tiresome and utterly atypical wrt my experiences.  Literary license, for entertainment value, is part of life, but impacts everyone differently.  The movie almost felt like an advertisement for a lopsided Xenophobe's guide to Japan.<br />I definitely felt it was far too shallow of a movie (and too shallow acting-wise) to rank anywhere near the top of my movie ranking list.  <br />I wonder how much the 'coppola production' thing resulted in them having an easier time getting funding, and getting distributed, etc. than might've happened otherwise (?)
B0000062Y2|3.0|This soundtrack continues to hold timeless appeal combining the live energy of a classical symphony with mid 70's classic rock. A wonderful marriage of theatrical vocals with powerful arrangements, as the songs segue into each other just like stage performance. Stand-out vocals goto both Ted Neeley as Jesus and Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene. The scope of sound/texture is wonderfully diverse, shifting from structured vocal parts, and conventional songs to awe-inspiring orchestral pieces. Symphonic and grandiose as it is delicate and tender, spiritual and inspiring as it is fiery and contemporary. 'The Jesus Christ Superstar' soundtrack is such a pleasing listen, charismatic vocals, orchestral power, 70's rock groove, and showtune flamboyance. It's not so much a 'stage to silver screen' adaptation as it is a brilliant well-produced soundtrack.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This sequel to 2001's &quot;Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone&quot; beats that one right to the curb in just about every way. Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable film to a degree but I find it to be dull and sometimes monotonous in places and some of the cast especially the trio were a bit awkward in places and it kind of dogged down the movie a bit. <br /> The second one however, corrects most of those problems. The formerly clumsy Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint really improve their roles on this sequel and seal their places in this movie series. <br /> It all begins after another awful summer at the Dursley's household where an elf named Dobby warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts for his second year but he ignores Dobby and goes right back to Hogwarts for his second year there. A series of attacks that have petrified students as well as Argus Filch's cat Mrs. Norris have been occuring and are endangering the lives of the students and staff at Hogwarts and is due to someone who is known as the &quot;Heir of Slytherin&quot;. Harry Potter along with his friends Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger is now working to find out who the &quot;Heir of SLytherin&quot; is before a monsters from a dark underground lair called &quot;The Chamber of Secrets&quot; is unleashed upon the school and killing off those who in Slytherins few who are unworthy of studying magic which are the 'muggleborns'. <br /> This mvoie is a lot better and more entertaining than the first HP movie. Keep in mind that it's also a lot darker and more sinister in nature as there are a lot of snakes as well as large droves of spiders that will scare the daylights out of younger viewers. Also the suspense is a bit much for younger viewers too. <br /> For older audiences though, there's no denying that this improves upon the flaws of the first and does what few sequels can: Surpass the original. <br /> Buy this DVD. The extras are absolutely worth it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye has made one of the most soniclly, lyrically, and soulfully satisfying albums ever. Much like the Neptunes his beats match the songs perfectly and his ryhmes skills impress you over and over again. There is virtually no filler and with 21 songs that's a great achievement. To point out one specific song would be stupid, becuase you need to listen to this whole album to get the full effect of what it is like to be a College Dropout. Good S***!
B0001AP12G|5.0|From start to finish includeing skits this album does not fail to deliver.  not a beat, hook, word, line, or bar seems out of place.  Every word is used to say something, and lets face it there are alot of rappers out there using alot of words but never saying anything.  The contradictions in kanyes material are endless but for some reason or another he gets away with it and even makes it work to his advantage, much like the late great tupac did.  But do not be mistaken kanye is no tupac he's not even a Jay-z, but at the same time thats part of his appeal kanye is the rapper for the average man his unorthadox almost conversational flow style sets him apart from the pack and will most deffinitly spur many clones in the coming year.  Production wise what else can I say its classic Kanye if you have the blueprint you know what your in for classic soul perfectly meshed with hip hop tracks.  If marvin gaye where still alive Kanye would be doing his production thats how good he is.  The stand out tracks, jesus walks,  never let me down, a track where its impossible to call who has the better verses Jay-z , Kanye or an unknown who should be known J ivy.  All falls down, we don't care and almost &quot;I can&quot; like song from Nas but a more creative version then esco could possibly create, and the single threw the wire which i call a modern day &quot;Juciy&quot; Biggies classic, only time will tell if Kanye's song will also be a classic. Many hip hop heavy weights appear on this album like common, mos def, and talib kweli, 3 artist that dont just do cameos for the hell of it which should tell you about the kind of respect that Kanye gets from the hip hop community. All together college dropout is one of those rare instant classics, in a hip hop world with no Jay-z, a DMX and nas that have been less then stellar of late it looked like the torch of hip hop would have to be carried by the chingy's and Nick cannons of the world which frankly is very depressing, but now thereshope theres Kanye West the savior of hip hop.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was from the original generation of kids who fell in love with &quot;The Lion King&quot; and I was fortunate enough to see it three times during its original theatrical run. I'm considerably older than I was in 1994, but I still love the film as much as I did back then. &quot;The Lion King&quot; has timeless elements that appeal to all age groups, and everyone from preschoolers to grandparents can find something to enjoy.<br />Despite the proliferation of  CGI, &quot;The Lion King&quot; holds up as a perfect example of how traditional animation can look just as beautiful. The cleaned up &quot;Special Edition&quot; does not dissapoint. However, I found it somewhat misleading that the DVD case said that the &quot;Original Theatrical Release&quot; version of the film was included. It is not; it's only the cleaned-up IMAX print sans &quot;Morning Report.&quot; (Is Disney starting to follow in George Lucas' footsteps?) But, hakuna matata! After a few viewings I was won over by the new version: you can't go wrong with enriched colors and a beautiful home theater sound mix! <br />The only worthwhile extra on the first disc is the audio commentary, which will please any diehard fan. The rest is nothing more than the Disney Channel bragging about itself.  A dull music video showcases the singing &quot;talents&quot; of the channel's teen &quot;stars&quot; in a mediocre version of &quot;Circle of Life.&quot; It even tacks on a pointless behind-the-scenes feature on the making of the video.<br />The second disc, however, is wonderful! It includes interviews, character designs, and many other things that I'll leave you to discover on your own. What's missing is the June 1994 &quot;making of&quot; TV special (hosted by Robert Guillame) in its entirety; only certain parts were used and were scattered throughout the various sections on the second disc.<br />Bottom line: &quot;The Lion King&quot; is a masterpiece that should NOT be left out of your DVD collection. A+
0385504209|1.0|I did not like this book.  The characters were one dimensional, the writing was way to preachy.  Tebing would explain something for 2 pages, and then Sophie would exclaim &quot;Are you saying blah blah blah??!!!&quot;  I could barely get through this book.  It did a good job of Catholic bashing also.  I had to read it to see what all the talk was about, but it was a total waste of time.  There are mistakes throughout the book.  There is NO action what so ever.  They stand around and talk through half the book.  Just dull, dull and more dull.  I want my money back!!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|bluntly put, this movie is amazing. the acting is pretty much flawless, the directing is perfect, and the plot comes together nicely at the end. the viewer is pretty much kept in the dark about whats even going on, and why people are doing what they are. however, this doesnt make the viewer seem lost, but just having enough clues to not seem completely lost. those with a short attention span: STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE. about half of the movie is just plain character foiling (ie staring at eachother, having standoffs, boarder-line corny dialouge that really makes things dramatic etc.). as ive said before, the directing is perfect. even when there is absolutely nothing happening, things still manage to be entertaining. (i still dont know why i like the entire scene of waiting for the train). but for those of you with an appreciation of great characters and a good plot, you'll love this one. if you havnt bought this movie yet, hear this: the end will blow you away. henry fonda is the devil! my only complaint is that early in the movie, some of the dialouge has been dubbed over. huh?? i couldnt believe my eyes when i was watching the rest stop scene near the begining, and the girls words didnt come close to matching her mouth. whatever.<BR>picture quality: 5/5 (friggin perfect)<BR>sound: 3/5. (nothing special, but not bad at all)
B0001AP12G|5.0|You know after my favorite rapper Jay-Z retired, I pretty much thought rap was dead. Jay was my favorite rapper and most of the other rap going on was just not attracting to me. It was all the same stuff to me except for Outkasts innovative double-album. You see I like creativity, I don't like the norm. <br />So with Kanye Wests debut he really brings the soul back to the hip hop world. He's speaking from the heart and his beats are just intoxicating and reek of soul. Not only that, his raps are on point and witty. In my opinion he's in among the top five rappers today not to mention being the top producer along with the Neptunes. I can't see an album being better than this, unless Eminem returns with a bang this year. So please do yourself a favor and pick up this album, because if your a fan of hip-hop than theres no reason that you should be without it.
B000062XGF|4.0|Let's get the sexist comment out of the way:  Catherine Zeta-Jones is simply one of the most beautiful women to ever grace a movie screen!<br />Now, with that out of the way, ENTRAPMENT is an enjoyable heist movie, and we're never sure who's zoomin who!!!  Sean Connery is elegant, if a bit lethargic, in his role, but always an actor who is fun to share a couple of hours with.  Zeta-Jones does a good job in her role, but her acting chops have certainly matured since this film.<br />Ving Rhames and Will Patton are adequate, but other actors could have done just as well.<br />There are some really breathtaking scenes, especially with Jones in the initial heist and the jawdropping escape from the bank.  It's not the best movie either one has made, but in spite of Jon Amiel's routine direction, I enjoyed it.
0375432302|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it honestly put my mind at work.<br />The book is about a different religion other than Christianity. The plot is ok, but the main purpose of this book is to give people, everyday common folk such as me a view of other religions that have been in existence for many years and that were thought to be banished once Christianity become the official religion.<br />Since reading this book I have been reading numerous books on religion and how Christianity become the powerhouse it is today.<br />Fundamentalists will have a problem with this book as they take the bible literally and cannot picture any other God besides the one that is written in the bible (or some who think God actually wrote the bible).<br />If you have an open mind and a hunger to learn you will enjoy what this book is all about.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I'll admit that I had never heard of the White Stripes until recently (I am one of those people that tends to think that the music they play on the new stations is all terrible, so I listen to classic rock and CDs a lot). Last month, I was on a trip with some friends and heard some of the new stuff by Coldplay, Outkast, etc. which I liked, so I bought a few CDs and, on a whim, downloaded &quot;Elephant&quot; onto Napster. Wow. There is no bad song on this album, I especially like &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and &quot;There's No Home for You Here&quot;. Initially I didn't think I would like it this much, as I love layered music with lots of instruments and fancy studio sounds and all that, but this blew me away.
6304539282|3.0|Lucas changed it so Greedo shoots first? What's up with that?
B0000009SE|5.0|While its not my favourite Zappa album I still love it dearly. For me the strongest track is Waka/Jawaka which is  beautifully composed and executed and bustles along with the the aid of a fantastic base line and fantastic use of horns. <br />The product of a beautiful mind.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Today there is too much crappy hip-hip and rap all over BET, MTV, MM etc and it has been for the last while or so. I have found that i have to listen to 30 half-ass rap/hip-hop artists untill i fall upon a good one. Kanye West is one of those good ones.<br />From top to bottom this cd is ridiculous as it has amazing beats, great lyrics and appearances. Some people dont think that K.West is an espeacially good rapper but i find that he is much more clear and fluent than a couple handful of others. I wont even bother listing the best tracks because they are all good in their own way for different moods and times. Hell, even the skits are good. Although, one song i really respect and enjoy alot is called &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; - amazing. <br />You should invest in this cd for yourself and find out how good this album is for yourself. From deep lyrics to rockin beats, this albums got it. <br />Of the few rappers/hip-hop artists you should support with your hard earned cash - K.West is one of them. Go and get this now!
0800103661|3.0|The world of this movie was never meant for one as deficient genetically as this Vincent, we are given to understand. In this nearish future, genetic design is depicted as at least a frequent occurrence, perhaps even the norm. Vincent was conceived normally and brings into the world a daunting catalogue of infirmities, summed up in a life-expectancy of 30 years, low by even the standards of certain far eastern countries today. This does not sit well with his consuming ambition to travel into space, and the film builds a collection of different plots and sub-plots around this basic quandary.<br /><br />To start with what is particularly good about Gattaca, the sets are striking. They create a `futuristic' aura very successfully, so much so that they they actually forced my attention on to what I believe to be one aspect of the film's main weakness, namely the plot or plots - Vincent's basic dilemma does not require a future setting at all. If he had been a weakling trying to get into a career in, say, sport or the armed services in 2004 that would have dealt with the issue just as well. The other thing that is distinctly good, in a certain kind of way, is the acting. When Gore Vidal, of all people, makes an early entrance in the role of Director, I reflected momentarily that I had never seen him acting before. In an instant I had corrected myself - I have never seen Vidal not acting. He acts a persona of his own creating whenever he appears on the media, and it is no surprise that he carries off his film role so convincingly. The Director is a far simpler personality that the real-life Gore Vidal. The three main roles are taken by Ethan Hawke as Vincent, Jude Law as the crippled but genetically perfect Jerome, and Uma Thurman as Irene. Like the Director, the characters are schematic and line-drawn, and such as they are they are very well done. The trouble, I hate to say, is the plotting.<br /><br />Not only is the basic setting not really required, the theme of Vincent's physical frailty actually has nothing to do with the ethical question of designer-vs-natural conception either. These threads are separate strands thrown into a single bag, so to speak, but not woven together. In much the same way the murder investigation, which threatens to blow Vincent's cover and reveal his clever DNA exchange with Jerome, is very loosely integrated with the main action - anything of that kind would have taken only the smallest mischance to come to light, and the efforts of the investigators make the quest for certain weapons in Iraq even as I write look a model of competence. It all left me not even needing to make a willing supension of disbelief at how an impoverished janitor obtained the funds first to pay the rapacious clandestine transgenetics operator and second to pay his way though the Gattaca induction programme. To cap it all, there is a further sub-plot of sibling rivalry between Vincent and his eugenic younger brother Anton, which must be important, I have to assume, as one of their periodic swimming contests takes place at the climactic stage of the story. And of course there is a love-theme as well, in case the film ran out of themes.<br /><br />I suppose this could hardly be called a rave-notice, and I fully admit that the film at least held my attention. It is not a bad film by any means, but the nearer in time to us that such an action is supposed to take place the harder it is to keep one's normal rational faculties switched off.railty actually has nothing to do with the ethical question of designer-vs-natural conception either.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I was surprised to see Bill Murray take this role, yes he did an awesome job acting, but what was the point.  I just didn't find this moving appealing.  I would ask NOT to see it again.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye captured the soul of Black America.....who ever doesnt like this cd you dont know what Hip-Hop if supposed to be. It aint all bling this and bling that.  Kanye's lyrics are relative to what's really going on in our world, and it is refreshing to hear it.
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code is a page-turner of a read that has created a storm of controversy which, undoubtedly, has in turn created a fat bank account for the author. And that's even before it becomes a movie, which it undoubtedly will.<br />As literature, however, the book can best be described as formulaic. The writing style is more than a tad wooden, and the protagonists careen from one narrow escape to the next. The author doesn't just foreshadow events, he all but rents billboards to announce them. Most amusing, those trying to unravel the puzzles and clues presented in the book are supposed to be skilled at cryptography and symbolism, but it took pages and pages for them to come up with the ancient word for wisdom. Hmmm. I guess they weren't quite as well schooled in those subjects as the author thought.<br />From a historical perspective, the key word to remember here is \\"fiction.\\" A lot of the art history in the book is fascinating, and the author weaves in plenty of intriguing (though not necessarily accurate) tidbits about everything from the Knights Templar to Opus Dei. But many of his \\"revelations\\" are either nothing new or totally untrue. This is somewhat ironic, considering that several characters talk of the need to keep the story of the Holy Grail alive and accurate.<br />This is a great book on an airplane or at the beach--providing plenty of detail without slowing the pace. But when it comes to questions of faith or historical accuracy, I'll seek elsewhere.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is Great! I own the Platinum Series Special Extended Edition. I never read the books, although I sould have when they were offered to me in the 1970s. Hindsight is 20/20 they say. It's worth your time and money to own this DVD! I own the first edition Lord of The Rinds-Fellowship of the ring as well in the same format at above!!
0385510438|5.0|Yes! <br />We return the brooding town of Clanton for a thriller with heart that reminds me of the passion that made A Time to Kill and The Firm such great books. <br />Danny Padgitt gets released from prison a mere 10 years after getting a &quot;life&quot; sentence, and members of the original jury are starting to drop like flies. <br />If you're like me you felt a steady decline in Grisham's writing since his first few novels. It was almost like he'd forgotten where he came from. He tried to redeem himself with Painted House and Bleachers, but I really couldn't get into them. There was a lot of heart in those books, but I didn't feel for the plot. There was a lot of plot in some of his later thrillers, but not a lot of heart. Finally we have both and it's a grand slam.
B000002UAO|2.0|This album is not so much bad as it is boring.  Norwegian Wood and In My Life still sound good today, but most of the rest of the songs just sound outdated.
B000002H97|4.0|The Black Album is Metallica's equivalent to the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street: a very good album but the end of Metallica's edginess and creativity. I was a huge Metallica fan in the 1980s from the time they released RTL. Metallica was different from mainstream metal bands. They were creative, edgy, angry, even a little frightening . I got a kick out the reaction I would get out of pop music/hair metal fans when I played Metallica - this combined look of repulsion and confusion. All that disappeared when you see guys who listened to Bon Jovi playing this album. Back then I detested this album as a total sell-out. A typical reaction of a Metallica purist. Today I'm less harsh. There are some great moments on this album, especially &quot;Sad But True&quot;. But there are moments that foreshadowed Metallica's decline. Overall, this is a very good album but falls short of the greatness of Metallica's earlier albums (with the exception in my opinion of &quot;Kill Them All&quot;).
B00004T8RK|3.0|Pretty much considered the worst of Pearl Jam's albums, and I would have to agree with that.  While its not a horrible album, I'd have to say that almost half of it doesn't do anything for me.  While the slow burners and ballads work, (\\"light years\\" \\"Nothing as it seems\\",\\"Insignificance\\", \\"thin air\\") other then \\"Breakerfall\\" and \\"Grievance\\" none of the other rockers did anything for me.  \\"Breakerfall\\" had that loose \\"Do the Evolution\\" feel and \\"Grievance\\" sounded like it was right out VS, but other then those 2, none of the other rock songs had the energy that you'd expect from the creators of Ten, Vs, Vitalogy.  3/5 stars
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's pretty simple if you think about it. It's the best album, by possibly the best band of the past decade. It's our modern day &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, and anyone without it, is missing alot more than just a cd. At least get it for &quot;Karma Police&quot;.
B00018D44U|4.0|It's so wonderful to see someone with a great new spin on Townes Van Zandt's &quot;Be Here to Love Me&quot;. What a terrific song!<BR>I'm new to her but Norah sounds great too.<br />StoneyG.
B000002LFZ|4.0|In case you haven't heard yet, &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; is one of the most popular and best selling groups in rock history, and this 16 track &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; is a good reason why. Included here are the big hits &quot;Don't Stop&quot;, &quot;Sara&quot;, &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, and &quot;You Make Loving Fun&quot;. Plus fan favorites like &quot;Everywhere&quot;, &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Over My head&quot;. The only song I don't care for is &quot;Tusk&quot;, and I would easily replace that with &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; or &quot;Seven Wonders&quot;. There's also the newer 2-disc &quot;Very Best Of&quot;, if you want more than what's here. Any fan of &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; might also want to check out &quot;Timespace: The Best Of Stevie Nicks&quot;. It's a little more 80's, but just as good.
B0000DC13U|1.0|I was very disappointed, not only because of the hype and \\"mystique\\" surrounding this film and it's director, but also because it gives us a very clear view of how absolutely marginal the talent of the Stones as a band was/is. Save your money, or watch it at your friend's house - you'll only need to see it once, if you can sit through it at all...
B0000DZEE3|5.0|Cuz they're gonna want to borrow it all the time once they see it!  I don't want to repeat all the other reviewers, but here goes:  sound is sensational--great separation, clear! video is awesome--you feel like you're there, not too many special FX, great line up of songs. At the risk of sounding mentally ill, I pretty much play this dvd whenever I can. Totally uplifting and inspirational.  I bought it about three weeks ago and soon after ordered &quot;Off The Map&quot; and &quot;Funky Monks&quot;, which are good, but Slane Castle will blow your mind. Did I mention that I'm in love with John Frusciante? Well, I'm in love with John Frusciante.  Picked up some of his solo stuff as a result of seeing what he can do on this dvd. Awesome guitarist, but then again they're all at the top of their game.  Excellence all around here.  Never seen the Peppers live. Now on the &quot;Things to Do before I Die&quot; list. This is my first review by the way. Okay, the OCD is kicking in again...gotta go put it on!
B0000524CY|5.0|So much has been said on the Exorcist by the other reviewers that you might think there wasn't anything left to say, well you are wrong. A very 'Bright' person in a review I have seen has recommended 'Jaws' instead of the Exorcist. Now I am asking myself whether that person has been using something called 'Brain' or whether the Demon of Stupidity actually possessed this person and Forced him to write his review!<br />Anyway, if you want a film with a disturbing plot that will send shimmers down your spine, I strongly recommend this film, and particularly this version.
B0001AP12G|4.0|I been following this mans music since the beginning. Since more than 90% of you knew who he is.. &amp; Im gonna be serious, this is not a 5 star album! THERE IS WAY too many skits! Its stupid! Now, Kanye is a CRAZY producer! Always nice with the beats, but this CD didnt show it. Some beats were boring &amp; dull! His lyrics were good. Some was real serious &amp; some was funny. But this is not a 5 star, my man could have done alot better! I still like this album, and say get it! Its good, but definitely an overrated album!
0385504209|3.0|I found this book to be mildly entertaining. My expectations were low as I had just finshed reading Focault's Pendulum, a highly involved similar story by Umberto Eco about secret societies and the like. Eco's book, while at times too complicated, was more suspenseful and better written. I needed an encyclopedia handy at all times. Brown's attempt at the subject was much tamer. I would recommend this book to folks who enjoy a thriller in an easy read. If you want a historical fiction that will make your brain hurt, read Focault's Pendulum.
B00005JLXE|4.0|I can't believe I'm writing this:  I enjoyed this movie.<br />I normally don't get into comic book plots about superheroes.  The &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Superman&quot; movies convinced me to stay further away.  As to the Incredible Hulk, if I want to see a giant green man I'll pick up a can of peas.  So with great trepidation, wailing, and gnashing of teeth (all six of them) I sat down and watched this DVD.<br />Knock me over with a feather.  DAREDEVIL entertained the daylights out of me.  From the predictable set-up of the story, to the rock 'em sock 'em action, to the great special effects, to the one-dimensional villains, this movie had me grinning like my cat after the goldfish disappeared.  I like to think the film succeeded because I sensed a tongue-in-cheek satire of all the other superhero yarns that clutter the Marvel Comics playground.  Looked to me like everyone involved with the production of this movie had a good time making it, primarily because no one took themselves too seriously. They just went with the flow, which is what the viewer should do; let the story suspend your stodgy sense of disbelief and take you for a ride with the blind, red leather crime fighter as he frolics and flies around Manhattan's skyscrapers.<br />I can't believe I'm writing this, either.  I actually liked Ben Affleck in this movie.  (But not enough to suffer through &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; again.)  Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan are superb menacing, grimacing, bloodthirsty villains.  And Jennifer Garner adds admirable buns of steel.  Enhanced by a fantastic soundtrack, DAREDEVIL delivers a solid entertainment punch.  Clark Kent would be jealous.<br />--D. Mikels
B00003CXCT|2.0|It's hard to get excited about the release of Star Wars on DVD when it's the inferior \\"special\\" edition that Lucas released a few years back. To me, adding CGI to this film is like painting a beard on the Mona Lisa. The Greedo-shoots-first thing is annoying, but I find the Jabba scene to be much worse. A CGI Jabba is superimposed over the original actor who played the part, and through the \\"magic\\" of computer special effects, we get to see a ridiculous moment with Han walking over Jabba's tail (this was done because Ford walked behind the actor in the original scene, something that proved problematic when the CGI Jabba was added). So much for the most feared criminal in the galaxy.<br />It's a shame that Lucas won't (at this stage, anyway) make the original theatrical version available alongside the \\"special\\" edition. It'd make every Star Wars fan deliriously happy, but it seems that Lucas doesn't care about the fans who grew up with the film as it originally was. It's also a huge slap in the face to the many filmgoers who saw this film repeatedly over the years and who purchased it in its various video/laserdisc incarnations. <br />If Lucas sticks to ditching the original version and only releases the SE on DVD, then I won't be buying it.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye's production and concepts are unmatched in todays field of Hip-Hop albums, however as an MC he's about 10 miles short of a major league fastball. Despite solid lyrics, I have a hard time maintaining interest with his limited vocal power. At times, he sounds on-point, and on a few occasions he sound like a complete amatuer. None-the-less, his amazing production and the complete assembly makes this an easy purchase.
B00018D44U|2.0|Norah Jones albums are like fast food burgers:  engineered to be &quot;tasty&quot; to the masses so they'll sell in the gazillions.  But that doesn't mean anyone gets nourished, or that connoisseurs should go anywhere near them.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|This film deals with isolation, dread, and boredom in a remote strange land. The plot is about Bill Murray a married man meeting a girl with a Boyfriend in the same hotel that he is staying at. The relationship the two have is hindered by the fact that he's married, she's commited, and the fact that he's leaving Tokyo in a couple of days. As the movie progresses you learn that Bill's marriage isn't even a happy one. Overall, I thought Bill Murray gave a great performance in this film, and in terms of visual aspects I really liked the cinematography. The best scene in this film is when Bill Murray is at his Whiskey ad shoot. As for the story line, it sort of meanders all over the place and ended up with no real resolution other than leaving you with the idea that through all the isolation and boredom it brought two people together and gave them both an experience that was memorable. Critics adored this film, but I've always prided my self in being an independent thinker and seeing through the hype. A three star film.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|...slow movies without an identifiable soundtrack.<BR>...movies about romances between old men and young women.<br />If you don't (and you're like me), then don't bother watching this movie!  The movie started out okay, but just went downhill and slowed down as the movie progressed.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|when i first saw Live At Slane Castle, i just sat ther dreaming away as anthony kiedis took off his shirt and sang his sweet heart out with his sexy voice, and how flea rocked his ass off and acted like his normal self-crazy and sexy too. and how john beautifully played his guitar straight from the soul,and how chad never missed a hit on the drums and smiled pretty much the whole time from ear to ear which was soooo cute. I would pay $100 for this DVD. Its the best DVD ever, and is worth way more than it is. The Chili Peppers are the best!! and always will be<BR>I luv u anthony kiedis, flea, john and chad <3 <3 <3
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah's smooth, and this second album continues the same warm, sultry sound she shared with us on Come Away With Me.. the formula is like the first, a winner. Good background music, good mood setter. <BR>I even enjoyed the unique addition of the Creepin In duet with Dolly Parton..<BR>Will be interested to hear more from this talented young lady! She's a welcome change from what's been playing on Top 40 music these days.
B0001AP12G|5.0|The long awaited college drop cd by Kanye West is meeting all of my high expectations.  The cd is full of guest appeareneces from Jay-z,Luda, Common, Talib, and Consequence, this cd is full of good music from begining to end. Kanye throughout the cd speaks on life struggels and also adds a little humor with it,for all u hip hop heads this cd lyrically is quite impressive Kanye surprised me! and his guest just make it better, the music vibe is something fresh and new which is definately what hip hop needs to day........I give it five stars if you dont have it run and go get it now.
0385504209|5.0|Wow this book is stellar!<br />From the day I bought Dan Browns newest novel The Davinci Code I have had a new out look on novels. I used to read books only for assignments in school, but never for enjoyment. After the first chapter this riveting novel grabbed a hold of me and I could not put it down! It starts off with a murder; Professor Robert Langdon (who is in Paris for a lecture) is called to help investigate this murder which leads to suspense and suprises beyond your imagination.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West is the definition of a hungry new artist.  Every beat on this album truly shines on its own.  The album as a whole has a unified concept and really flows from one song to the next without getting redundant like some (neptunes). Might look out for this guy at the grammys next year.  His rhymes could use some improvment, but that will come with experience and you can already tell he puts a lot of thought into each line.  Plus, he doesnt constantly rap about the same topic throughout. He avoids mysogyny and even glorifies women.  His guest spots, yes even jay-z, are hot without taking away from kanye. He has more skits/interludes than i would normally like but they do have a point for the most part.  This isnt like 90% of rap albums that you pick up and only like the two or three songs, I can let this CD play from start to finish with no filler tracks.  He truly spits his soul through the wire.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye does his thing on this cd from top to bottom.  I've listened to the cd non-stop and have found no flaw on it...similar to listening to Illmatic, the Blueprint, or Reasonable Doubt.  Its hard to list the best of the album since they are all great, but &quot;We Don't Care&quot; is a great feel good song, &quot;All Falls Down&quot; is beautiful, &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; is sick, Jay-Z and J. Ivy come through on &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot; where I didn't think it was possible but Kanye outshines Jay in his flow (not by much), &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; is great for the ladies and the club, &quot;Breathe in Breathe Out&quot; has Ludacris coming through big time on the hook and Kanye spits some of his best bars in it, &quot;Two Words&quot; w/ Mos and Free is just insane, &quot;Through the Wire&quot; is a masterpiece in its own, and &quot;Last Call&quot; is one of the most melodic rap songs ever.  Kanye has changed the game for producers who &quot;can't rap&quot; cause he not only can, but he shines.  Did I mention his beats are better than anyone in the game.  Dr. Dre who? Swizz who? Timba who? Kanye is here and he has taken over the game.  Good thing Jay-Z retired, cause now the crown belongs to Kanye outright.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Goodness gracious.  This is by far, in my opinion, the most amazing album of 2003.  This album by far creates a mood and outstanding degree of excitement to one's ear.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I loved this movie from the opening shot right to parting one. The dislocation of the characters is made even more apparent by the hyperreality of Japan. I read other reviews about the slow pace and making Japan look &quot;ugly&quot;. All I can say is these people didn't get it. It's slow ON PURPOSE. The characrters are in an emotional, contemplative, stupor. How else would you show that? Exactly the way Sophia Coppola does, with close-ups and self-depricating dialogue. This movie captured the &quot;otherness and familarity&quot; of many Asian cities. Tokyo is the other star of the film and the warmth of the Japanese people. I didn't feel that this movie denigrated the Japanese at all. You have to pay attention to the naunces in the movie. It is very subtle. Not for people who want a &quot;plot&quot; or things have to spelled out for them.
B0001AP12G|5.0|WELL I  WAS WAITING A WHILE 4 THIS ALBUM 2 DROP 4 A WHILE (LIKE SOME OTHERS AS WELL)THE BEATS ARE KRAZY! I LIKE KANYES STYLE PRODUCTION-WISE HE TAKES SOME OLD SCHOOL SONGS AND GIVES THEM A LIL MORE OF A PITCH IF U WILL...ANYWAYZ THIS ALBUM IS HOT SO FAR AS ONE OF THE YEARS MOST ANTICIPATED ALBUMS (NOT 2 MENTION CLIPSE,LLOYD BANKS,50 CENT,DR.DRE,D-12,EMINEM ETC.) SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE 2 C HOW THIS ALBUM WILL STAND OUT WITH THESE OTHER RELEASES ANYWAYZ GO SUPPORT KANYE HE DESERVES IT!!!! I THINK JAY-Z SAID IT BEST &quot;..KANYE U A F***ING GENIUS!!!&quot;
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Bill Murray for best actor not sure why? Lost in Transtation was dull,dry and boring it could not keep my attention,nothing really happened in this slow depressing movie of two people Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson).Both were in Tokyo Bob for the shooting of wiskey commercials and Charlotte there with husband John (Giovanni Ribisi)a photographer on business.They both find one another as lonely lost soles and talk to one another about their life, and so they understand each other sounds intersting right, well two star's for trying. Enjoy!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|I would like to highly recommned tha any one who like the <BR>  first movie purchase  a copy of it for yourself and <BR>  a its a terrfic gift.
B00004YX0R|5.0|There's no need for italics when playing Beethoven.  The music will speak for itself just fine, and that's just the approach Talich has chosen.  These guys are as good, technically speaking, as anybody but what stands out is how unassuming they are.  None of that &quot;look Ma, see how fast I can play&quot; that we get from the Emersons.  Anyway, this is the set for you.  Yes, I've heard others -- Italiano, Budapest, Guarneri, and Tokyo -- and the Talich has them beat across the full cycle of 16.
B00000AFWW|4.0|I have just started getting into Hole, But the melody of the album is awesome.<br />Although hole has since de-banded, the music is still a memory of what music used to be, Awesome.<br />Dying would be my favorite song of the album.<br />To be a hole fan, Celebrity Skin is a Must.
B00013RC8O|5.0|The DVD, while somewhat lacking in &quot;special features&quot; was still worth the wait.  The picture and sound quality are much better than the VHS.  But keep in mind that the film is from 1971 so don't expect perfection.  The real plus is that you get both versions of the film - the US release and the UK release w/ the added scenes of Kowalski picking up a female hitchiker. You also get the director's commentary for both versions.  The other features are TV &amp; theater trailers.  <br />If you are a real fan of this movie - get the DVD.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Just want to say that it's great to finally have my favorite part of the star trek legacy available in DVD format with the extra features.  I have been a fan of (TOS) (TNG) (DS9), as well as the feature length movies, and can say this is one of my favorite installments, so in general i am just saying Good job
B0001AP12G|3.0|I was very excited for this release, maybe i shouldnt have been.  Given i heard alot of the songs prior kind of ruined my listening.  Overall it is a good cd, no classic though.  Not even close.  Lyrically he is better then i expected, style and all.  But i was expecting some more from the beats.  Yes i said it.  Besides &quot;through the wire&quot;, &quot;family business&quot;, and &quot;breathe in&quot; nothing compares to a &quot;get by&quot;, &quot;this way&quot;, or most importantly &quot;encore&quot;.  And this is the biggest disapointment, no track that makes you jump out of your seat like that encore beat did.  With that said i still believe this cd is a better release than most of the hip hop now a days and yes kanye is a very good thing for mainstream hip hop right now.  Just was lookin for some better beats ironically on this album.
B000088E6D|5.0|I think Michael Buble has the potential to be the next big thing. He's got a terrific voice with so much energy. This CD is classic and smooth. Michael is a breath of fresh air compared to some of his contemporaries. I'm looking forward to his next CD.
0385504209|5.0|This was my first Dan Brown book, and I'm already hooked.  The connections that are made in this amazing book were breath-taking.  The suspense of the book would not allow you to put it down.  You will learn things that you have never heard of before, BOGGLING YOUR MIND!  Once you think you have everything figured out, Brown throws another twist in, making your assumptions false.  This intense book is by far the best I have ever read.  A MUST READ for anyone who likes to challenge their opinions.
B00003CXXS|4.0|&quot;King Kong&quot; was probably the only dinosaur film ever to incorporate a good pulp adventure story along with the thrill of dinosaurs on the loose. &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; doesn't even come close in that sense, but, having said that, it does give more to its story than do its predecessors or any other dinosaur film. The story is familiar: rescuing someone who is lost amidst extreme danger. The added ingredient is the secondary story of watching two estranged people finding their way back to each other; the screenplay steering many of those moments with levity. William H. Macy is one of those actors who is always enjoyable no matter how good or bad the film may be in which he appears. The Macy-Leoni pairing has wonderful chemistry and Sam Neill is, as always, highly likeable as well as heroic in a believable way. The 90 minute length reflects the film's cut-to-the-chase (literally in a lot of moments) attitude. The previous two films were cumbersome. JP III has better animated dinosaurs and some classic moments. The trip down the river, in a small boat, is reminiscent of story lines of the Far East right out of the works of Joseph Conrad or of Jules Verne, etc. Jurassic Park III is a fun film, a thrill ride and should be taken as no more than that. The screenplay and the film makers do their jobs.
B00018D44U|5.0|Needless to say that Norah's first CD was excellent, but her new one &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; does feel like home. It's a little bit more edgy--a dobro/slide guitar here and there, a nice electric piano and an organ at times, and even an harmonica, and a sax lightly accent this album. Norah's vocal range is top, going from pure jazz to a little touch of alt-country and then even moving into a little blues here. I'm telling you if you want to listen to excellent music that has this special touch pulling on your soul then this is it. And it's not heavy, instead it's easy, real smoooth with a little edge here and there. You'll be surprised! Excellent, Norah!
B0000CFW87|5.0|Other than Barbra Streisand, Josh has the best recording and singing voice in the industry. I don't have his first CD, but this is an impressive effort. For those who want to sleep through Josh's refreshing vocals, go right ahead. We won't wake you up.<br />Josh is on course to legendary status. His voice is just that good. A lot of people think he's an opera singer, but this is a Pop CD. Josh has a classically trained voice so it's not traditional Pop. But Just because some of the songs are in a foreign language, that doesn't make it a classical or opera CD.<br />Billboard referred to him as the &quot;King of Highbrow Pop.&quot; So accurate. I love the entire CD. Josh, keep up the work!!!
B00003CXCT|1.0|This edition does not include the original versions of the movies as they appeared in theaters...not even as a special edition. Only the heavily altered versions are available.
0739307312|5.0|A page turner that as soon as you are done, you will want to start all over.  We bought this book only two weeks ago and already it has changed hands 4 times.  Impossible to put down once you have started.
B000002UJQ|2.0|How dare several reviewers call this the greatest album of all times, and Radiohead the new Beatles? The last band to be named the new Beatles whose name I have forgotten must be singing in Las Vegas now doing their farewell tour. Its ok to enjoy this album but only an ignorant or a joker would call it the best album of all times. Grow up and listen to more albums.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I just had to say Amen to what was said in another comment, &quot;I would compare it to the male rap version of Lauryn's Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.&quot; I was thinking that same thing all last night while listening to it. I'm a girl so I had to eco what was said. <br />I think this CD is absolutely BRILLIANT!!! This is exactly what hip hop needed. I hope the Grammys don't overlook this masterpiece just because Outkast won this year. Kanye deserves to be recognized for this outstanding achievement.<br />Grab this CD. It's going to go fast once word spreads!!!
B00018D44U|2.0|If you absolutely love the 1st CD like I do, then don't buy this 2nd CD (Feels like home). It will disappoint you, really disappoint you. Just go to Apple iTune and download (buy) &quot;Sunrise&quot;, &quot;Those sweet words&quot;, and maybe &quot;carnival town&quot;. The rest are quite disappointing compared to the what she had on the 1st CD. Boring songs and I don't even why she put Dolly Parton in the CD. I like Dolly, but just not in this context.<br />So disappointed, I should demand my money back.
B00005JLSE|5.0|This great film adaptation of the Broadway musical is now preserved on DVD to enjoy over and over.  Includes the great number CLASS as well as some other fun DVD features.<br /><br />Latifah and Zeta Jones are dead-on perfect and even Zelwegger with her bony body and funny bee-stung mouth manages to turn in a performance that would have pleased the legendary Gwen Verdon.  The direction and choreography are Fosse-esque enough to please Broadway diehards and the art direction, wonderful.  Deserving of its Oscar and box office successes!
B00005JMCW|5.0|I love that there are quite a few good films for young girls to see. Movies with spunk. This one is no exception. It's fresh and funny, and brilliantly acted out. Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan do amazing jobs pretending that they are one another, so much so that I actually began to believe that they had switched bodies.<br />Like many mother/daughter's, Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) argue. Anna thinks her mother is ruining her life. Tess thinks she is just watching out for her daughter. They go out for Chinese and a little old Chinese lady gives them each a fortune cookie, which is the catalyst for their switch. Will they ever get back to their own bodies? And more importantly, can they learn to respect one another?<br />Of course this movie is predictable, but that's not the point. It's sweet and a total blast to watch, not to mention laugh out loud funny.<br />The DVD contains some good special features, including alternate endings, which are pretty cool. I have no doubt that teen girls are going to go insane over this film, but men, women, and picky little boys who won't watch anything but Pokemon will like this movie as well.
B00006690G|3.0|Okay, first of all, to anyone who thinks rap is just a fad, you're SO wrong. In reality, it is a music form that is 30 years old and has been in the mainstream since 1989 (that's FIFTEEN years). If it's not dead now, it's going to die. Also, to the people who hate rap, do not review rap CDs. Your opinion will be biased and you usually end with something like &quot;METAL RULES!!!&quot;. That's cool, if you like metal, but don't come around here dissing rap when you've only heard one song on the radio. Also, his fans are not just white kids 13-20. My parents and step-parents, my last four English teachers (2 college), and numerous other adults I know like his music for it's shock and originality.<br />On to the point. This is an average CD (thus the 3 stars). It has some good beats, but the lyrics are getting pretty tiring. There are some exceptional songs, like &quot;Square Dance&quot;, &quot;Till I Collapse&quot;, and &quot;Drips&quot; (I don't know why so many people hate the last one there, I think it's pretty funny). The rest of the songs are just average. Yes, the average ones include &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot; (Oh, no he didn't! Yeah), &quot;White America&quot;, and &quot;Sing for the Moment&quot;. The totally lame songs include &quot;Without Me&quot;, &quot;Sayin' Good-bye to Hollywood&quot;, and &quot;When the Music Stops&quot;. <br />I loved Eminem's first CD was awesome and packed with original lyrics like &quot;I can't rap no more/I just murdered the alphabet&quot; and &quot;how the f--- can I be white?/I don't even exist&quot;. Then we got the Marshal Mathers LP which, no doubt, will go down with All Eyez on Me, Illmatic, Ready to Die, Reasonable Doubt, The Chronic, and Doggystyle as an essential classic rap album. But now, Eminem has turned into showing us a more melancholy/monotone side of him that just isn't that exciting. Perhaps a different delivery with sharper lyrics would help us to accept it if he still wanted us to see that side of him. Hismixtapes with Green Lantern are cool, with clever lyrics, but the Eminem Show is average.<br />Oh well, Dre said his next album will bring out the Slim Shady again.
B0000CFW87|1.0|This cd is very boring.  Josh Groban sings opera like music and has no style of his own.  If he was a color, he would probably be clear.  His voice is no better then most singers.  He has no identity except the boring ugly guy with long hair.
B0001906O0|5.0|This box set is amazing...pretty much everything is here. For the stuff that isn't - they are RE RELEASING 12 cd's over the next 18 months w/ bonus discs...thats 12 more discs of goodies people! Get over it!<br />The songs for \\"boys don't cry\\" were NOT re-recorded<br />\\"cult hero\\" was NOT the 1st single - it was a single in between three imaginary boys and 17 seconds.<br />if you are gonna gripe, get the facts straight!<br />but while i'm at it...the remix of \\"wrong number\\" really really sucks. In fact, disc 4 isn't very strong at all<br />BTW, maybe the person from OHIO who reviewed the box set on 2/14/04 should realize the re-releases are on the way.....why would \\"the weedy burton\\" be on the bsides box when its a hidden album track on three imaginary boys? does anyone understand that one???

B000002GYG|4.0|Listening to this album is like sitting in a booth across from Tom one-on-one.  &quot;Let me tug on your coat for a while&quot; he rasps.  While these are not his very best songs they are greatly entertaining.  Mr. Waits has more one-liners than Henny Youngman.  His story about a cup of coffee &quot;too weak to defend itself&quot; against a rowdy veal cutlet is priceless.  He may sound like he's three sheets in the wind but I'm convinced that no one could deliver such a magnificent live performance PUI (performing under the influence).  A good cd to put on when you're driving alone at night.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a delightful romantic fantasy of love and comedy, of vivid color and some preposterous antics of love and friendship that will send mawkish tears down your cheeks while making you laugh out loud. If not, turn in your headset for a heart.<br />Audrey Tautou is Amelie, a fashion-sharp Parisian waitress with an impish heart of gold and an shyness born of a bizarrely restricted childhood.  She is cute and innocent, but not too innocent.<br />Her father, who was a physician, thought she had a defective heart because every time he put the stethoscope to her little chest it was beating wildly.  A voice-over explains that this was caused by the excitement that Amelie felt because her frigid father, whom she wanted so much to hold her, although he never did, was actually touching her.  Because of an imagined heart condition she is kept out of school and tutored at home.<br />After her mother dies from being hit by a falling body (an actual human body on its way to the pavement from a tall building) we are flash-forwarded to the present where we find little Amelie all grown up.  She still has no love in her life.  But one day while listening to a news report of the death of Princess Di she drops something on the floor of her apartment.  It rolls against a tile in the bathroom, dislodging the tile.  Amelie pulls down the tile and finds in a hole in the wall a little tin box full of a boy's childhood mementoes from many years ago.  In a characteristic bit of inspiration she decides to find that little boy, now grown into middle age, and give him the box.  But she is shy and so must invent a stratagem.  She arranges to call him when he is near a public phone booth in which she has placed the box.  So delighted with the joy she has given him, Amelie sets off on a series of inventive and pixie-like intrusions into the lives of others in order to bring them happiness and even love.<br />While this R-rated fantasy would delight children there is too much actual sex in it for most American moms to tolerate for their little ones.  In fact in the French style sex is made innocent, and of course that will not set well with those of a prudish nature.<br />Favorite corny pun: \\"Even artichokes have hearts.\\"  Favorite elaborate joke: sending her father's garden gnome on the world tour that he won't take himself, and having the gnome photographed at tourist sites and the photos sent airmail to a very perplexed dad. Favorite joke: the beggar refusing a handout saying he takes Sundays off.  Favorite scheme: reconstructing through cut and paste and photocopy the words of the landlady's beloved, and then fashioning a last love letter to her from him that was lost in the mail for forty years.<br />The two disc set includes a wealth of information to delight afficionados.  There's an interview with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, some footage on how Amelie was made, filmographies of cast and crew, audition footage, etc., etc.<br />Bottom line: very funny, heart-warming and strikingly original.most American moms to tolerate for their little ones.

0385504209|1.0|This book just goes to show that my theory about famous authors being on the bestseller list is true.  They can write any boring, ridiculous pap and still be there 10 weeks later anyway.  After being told by my son - who NEVER reads fiction - that he could not put this book down I decided to read it even though the subject matter held absolutely NO INTEREST to me.  I got to about page 150 and I had to give up my endless suffering and boredom since I was doing EVERYTHING else but reading this book.<br />After my husband read it (he never reads fiction either) I made it my mission to complete this to see if I was in fact missing something.  Well, life is too short for me to ever go past 150 pages of a book ever again if I didn't like it to begin with.<br />This so called &quot;page turning suspense&quot; is ludicrous since the &quot;suspense&quot; ends a mere page later and all I could think of was the one dimensional cardboard characters running all over on a wild goose chase that I didn't care about in the first place.<br /><br />Give me a break!  I should never listen to people who don't read fiction and I will continue to go by my rule that being on the best seller list doesn't mean ANYTHING about the QUALITY of a book.  WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!  I would have enjoyed root canal more.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I must say I am not suprised. I am not the biggest rap fan in the world, I'm more R&amp;B, but I knew as soon as I heard 'through the wire' that this cd would be hot. I own over 500 cds and out of all of them I can count on one hand the ones that I can listen to from beginning to end. This CD is one of them. It is UNBELIEVABLE!!. Not just because of his crazy beats and the catchy hooks but simply because he is so real. I can't even rap and he makes me feel like I can. Simple ryhmes that are so true. I found myself listening to the words and understanding everything. The way he puts worlds together and makes you feel like 'yeah, yeah I can relate to that'. He reaches every level, EVERY LEVEL. I read these reviews all the time but I never had the desire to write one. Let's just say this cd changed me. It is obvious that he has a God given talent that is remarkable. I'm just thankful that he decided to put it to good use. If you buy this cd I gaurantee you won't regret it, because I know I don't.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm talking about the one-star reviewers of course. They waste so much time trying to bring down the rating of a CD just because they hate the artist and they haven't even listenend to it. They're missing out some good stuff.<BR>I'm gonna be honest with the CD. It's very good music though not the best I've heard. For Britney it is definately the best probably better.<BR>I buy all sorts of CDs ranging from Backstreet boys to Linkin Park to Eminem. Yeah, I'm a music buff and I like all sorts of music that is good. I have to say that this is definately music. Though I sort of did like Britney's previous efforts, this CD beat those and it is one of the best CDs on my rack.<BR>I would suggest anyone who is interested in good music ranging from pop to hiphop to rnb to buy this one. There're a lot of interesting songs here and though the lyrics aren't very good or anything, they're listenable unlike her old stuff.<BR>I recommend this as a must-buy for music buffs (forget this if you're a straight rock fan or classical fan), a must-buy for her fans and a must-try to people who like pop/hiphop sort of thing. <BR>If you just hate Britney and you're not willing to give her a chance because she's got poor vocals, forget this one. It's CD you'll like only when you want to enjoy some good music and if you want to have some fun, not from a critic's point of view.
6301972139|5.0|Many of those who have seen the film directed by Baz Luhrmann and starring Nicole Kidman (2001) may not know about this film which appeared about 50 years earlier. Based on Pierre LaMure's biographical novel and directed by John Huston, this Moulin Rouge focuses entirely on the life of Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. Two years previously, Jose Ferrer received an Academy Award for leading actor in Cyrano de Bergerac. He was nominated again in 1952 for his portrayal of Toulouse Lautrec (he also plays the painter's father, Comte Alphonse de Toulouse-Lautrec, a small but significant role in this film), losing to Gary Cooper (High Noon).<br /><br />How interesting that each of Ferrer's two greatest performances on-screen is of a French aristocrat with a significant physical deformity who encounters only failure and despair in his love life.  In any event, Ferrer is brilliant in a cast of consistently high quality. As chanteuse Jane Avril, Zsa Zsa Gabor essentially plays herself: beautiful, vain, melodramatic, self-absorbed, good-hearted, and charming. Also noteworthy are Colette Marshand (as Marie Charlet), Suzanne Flon (Myrianne Haven), Katherine Kath (La Goulue), and Christopher Lee (Georges Seurat). Although nominated for several Academy Awards, this film received only two (for Color Art Direction and Color Costume Design), both richly deserved. Huston skillfully directs an excellent cast while blending seamlessly Oswald Morris' cinematography with George Auric's musical score.<br /><br />Born in 1864, Toulouse-Lautrec spent his childhood years on family estates near Albi, with Paris becoming his home in 1872. The victim of a genetic bone condition that made him vulnerable to fractures, he walked with a cane by age thirteen and grew to be only four feet eleven inches tall. One example of Huston's genius is the fact that much of the film is shot from Toulouse-Lautrec's perspective. That is, we see the aristocrat-artist's world almost literally through his eyes as he sits and sketches in the music hall, then drags himself to his stunted feet and slowly, painfully resumes his late-night debauchery.<br /><br />In frail health throughout his adult years, Toulouse-Lautrec exacerbated his situation with alcoholism which no doubt hastened his death in 1901. Lying in bed and near death, he learns from his astonished father that his paintings will be on exhibition at the Louvre. (\\"The Louvre, Henri, the Louvre! I did not know, Henri, I did not understand....\\") This final scene reminds me of the final scene in Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939), starring Robert Donat. Both Toulouse-Lautrec and Charles Chipping are near death, barely conscious. Both imagine being visited by those they once knew, bidding them a fond farewell. For Toulouse-Lautrec, the performers from the Moulin Rouge; for Chipping, many of the boys he taught over a period of several decades at Brookfield School.<br /><br />This film is a feast for the eyes. At least for about two hours, it enables us to return to Paris near the end of the 19th century, to a world which remains vivid in the great art of Seaurat, Renoir, Degas, Monet, Manet, Bonnard....and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.the music hall, then drags himself to his stunted feet and slowly, painfully resumes his late-night debauchery.

0812550706|5.0|...the best book on leadership, the best book on strategy, and possibly the best sci-fi story I have ever heard.<br />I am not even much into science fiction, not in reading at least. But I devoured this brilliant debut novel from Scott Card (1985) from cover to cover. It's intoxicating, educational and very, very gripping.<br />We follow the life of our young protagonist Ender (nickname for Andrew) who is billed as a dynamic potential leader to save the Earth from &quot;buggers&quot; (malicious aliens). Reviewers lament that it potrays children as saviours of the earth from but this is not exactly an impossibility -- kids today are already a lot sharper than they used to be 20 years ago. It's a fascinating testament to the adaptability of human beings -- you impose demands, we will rise to the task. Come to think of it, the book does frequently bring up the inhumane element of pushing kids to the limit as Ender gets disillusioned about the mission that was forced on him several times during the course of the story.<br />Above all its interesting setups and games in a training camp in space, the book touches upon some out-of-box thinking by kids to win their games. For this reason, it makes for a FABULOUS strategy book. As Ender wins and develops into a leader of kids a lot older than he is, we are exposed to a lot of leadership situations that are so real in actual life it's almost eerie.<br />The book has a bunch of lessons about morality, good and bad, leadership, thinking, etc etc. Something I'd recommend in a blink to anyone I care about. Get this phenomenal novel even if you don't have a taste for science fiction. You'll love it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Amazing.  There is no other way to describe the debut album by Kanye West but with the word amazing.  It's creative, down-to-earth, and straight up thought-provoking at times.  The world was looking for great things from him after he lent his production genius to kweli's &quot;get by&quot; and the alicia keys track but, in my humble opinion, West surpasses all expectations.  His rhymes are up to par with his beats, which is really saying something since his production has produced single after single.  This is the best album that I've heard in a while.  The last album that I felt close to this way about was the Talib Kweli album.  If you liked &quot;Quality&quot;  then I would definitely check out the &quot;College Dropout.&quot;  Actually, even if you haven't even heard Talib Kweli before (if that's true then you should be slapped) pick up the album.  I grabbed it the day it hit stores and it has not dissappointed.  Make sure you check out &quot;All falls down&quot;, &quot;Never let me down&quot;, &quot;Get em High&quot;, &quot;Family Business&quot;, &quot;Last call&quot;, and &quot;jesus walks.&quot;  You might have thought that &quot;thru the wire&quot; is hot, and it most definitely is, but it is far from the best song on this amazing album.
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah Jones \\"Come Away With Me\\" had truly taken many people like myself into a new abyss of music that's mellow, sweet, gentle, and melodic to the spirit and soul. I believe her refreshing voice has opened me up to respect her as the true professional artist of today's overatted pop artists, and for truly being one of the very few to show how true artistry and commercial success can be shown without overshadowing or distracting the audience with the sexed up image. Her new record, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is truly an all around circle of so much music, like jazz, country, and the blues. Like the title, this record truly does make me feel like i am home in Texas. I absolutely love every song on this album. If you liked \\"Come Away With Me,\\" you will like \\"Feels Like Home\\" better. It has more rhythm, soul, and music rolled up into a classic work of art without yeilding away from the voice and the talent that started it all.
B00005S88E|5.0|Does anyone know the availability of this?  I saw that it was advertised as a &quot;SACD&quot; release (noted in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine 2003 year-end magazine's sacd advertisement).  Is it out or is it being released?  HELP!
B00018D44U|5.0|Though trying to follow a massive success like Come Away with Me could not be easy, Norah Jones has several things to her advantage.<BR>Firstly, her music was never that showy to begin with, instead relying on quiet melodicism, very restrained arrangements, and the mix of Jones' youthfully exuberant, sensual voice against classic jazz settings.  She became that marketing dream, a young artist with actual talent working in a respectable musical genre -- with looks, to boot.<br />I always found it funny when people called Jones' work on Come Away with Me &quot;mature beyond her years&quot; because it was apparent to me that what distinguished her was, in fact, the slight girlish lilt in her voice, which livened up the potentially overly mannered arrangements and compositions and lent a disarming innocence to songs like &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; and &quot;Feelin' the Same Way&quot;.  Her latest album, Feels Like Home, is truly where her voice has matured, acquiring a richer timbre, more of a womanly persona.  Her sound has diversified, as well, as shown by the instrumental presence of The Band's Levon Helm and Garth Hudson on the record.  There is indeed a rootsier feel to this record; some of the rhythm arrangements and the harmony vocals sound downright country.  But the country idioms fit Jones remarkably well and help her loosen up her sound as well.  Lead track &quot;Sunrise&quot; uses a spare standup-bass-and-percussion groove to give Jones' voice a playful, subtle musical backdrop; the shimmering acoustic guitars and Daru Oda's harmony vocal on &quot;In the Morning&quot; are definitely in moody country territory; Jones even adds a touch of twang and funky phrasing in &quot;Creepin' In&quot;, accompanied by a barroom rhythm that could've come straight from a Western.  And I was very pleased to see Jones expanding her talent into the songwriting, and doing it very well, writing the warmly appealing &quot;What Am I to You?&quot; on her own and co-writing five others.<br />As easy as it would be to say Jones' first record was a fluke, Jones has proven herself to be an artist of substance, vision and talent with this second record while pulling a hat trick, diversifying her sound without sacrificing any of her own identity or integrity.  Bravo, Norah; you should always make the music that you want.  With singers like Jewel pawning their true identities in pursuit of sales, Norah Jones is one to treasure.
055357342X|5.0|Don't let the term \\"fantasy\\" fool you:  this is not limp-wristed, frolic-through-the-trees stuff.  All three books have been well-written, violent, consistent and quite addictive.  Without going into a rehash of the plot of this book, let me just say that it stays true to the previous two novels and continues to develop the characters even more.  Mr. Martin does an excellent job of fleshing out and making believable all of the main protagonists, and he clearly provides reasons for a character's growth and change, e.g. Jaime and Daenerys.  The plot is well thought out, the action is well choreographed, the cliffhangers have caused many sleepless nights and I really like the fact that \\"magic\\" has so far played a minor role.  HIGHLY recommended.<br />In addition, I hope Walder Frey gets his just desserts, the Hound comes over to the side of \\"good,\\" Daenerys kicks some butt, and Rand al-Thor gets run over by a farmer's cart and is killed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|The DVD collection of \\"Firefly - The Complete Series\\" was clearly a labor of love for those who made the series.  It includes the eleven episodes originally aired on the Fox television network plus three unaired shows, commentary on fully half the episodes, and a large assortment of extras.  As a courtesy to the TV fans of \\"Firefly\\" this review contains NO SPOILERS. <br />\\"Firefly\\" was often described as a \\"space western\\".  Set 500 years in the future, when a large number of planets and moons have been terraformed, many frontier planets are subsisting with little more than basic 19th-century tools: horses, wagons, cattle, lever-action rifles, and the like.  But this is the future when America and China were the clear winners of the race for cultural dominance so every backwater yokel can curse in Chinese as well as twangy American idiom, and newspapers have moving text.<br />Malcolm Reynolds (played by Nathan Fillion) and Zoe Warren (Gina Torres) are survivors (on the losing side) of the war to unite all the planets.  To gain some freedom from the encroaching forces of the victorious Alliance, they purchase an old transport ship of the Firefly class.  Named \\"Serenity\\" for the battle of Serenity Valley, where they lost the war, the ship's crew was fleshed out with pilot Wash Warren (Zoe's husband, played by Alan Tudyk), mechanic Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and muscle Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin).  They later pick up some passengers: companion (futuristic geisha) Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), doctor Simon Tam (Sean Maher) and his troubled genius sister River (Summer Glau), and Shepherd (preacher) Book (Ron Glass).<br />I'll leave the show summary there (NO SPOILERS, remember) but just point out that one of the hallmarks of Joss Whedon shows is how people who aren't related become family.  In its short run \\"Firefly\\" was a shiny example of family-building.  Now on to the DVD collection.<br />The DVD set consists of 4 discs, each in individual plastic holders, and an outercardboard sleeve.  The only difference in the packaging is a different cast member portrait for each plastic box; each disc is pressed with the same image of the \\"Firefly\\" title.  There are no extra materials in the packaging.  Here's a breakdown of the contents of each disc.<br />DISC ONE: (picture of Nathan Fillion, \\"Malcolm Reynolds\\")<BR>1. \\"Serenity\\" (original pilot, a double-length episode)<BR>   Commentary by executive producer Joss Whedon & actor Nathan Fillion<BR>2. \\"The Train Job\\"<BR>   Commentary by executive producers Joss Whedon & Tim Minear<BR>3. \\"Bushwhacked\\"<br />DISC TWO: (picture of Ron Glass, \\"Shepherd Book\\")<BR>4. \\"Shindig\\"<BR>   Commentary by writer Jane Espenson, actor Morena Baccarin, and costume designer Shawna Trpcic<BR>5. \\"Safe\\"<BR>6. \\"Our Mrs. Reynolds\\"<BR>7. \\"Jaynestown\\"<br />DISC THREE: (picture of Adam Baldwin, \\"Jayne Cobb\\")<BR>8. \\"Out of Gas\\"<BR>   Commentary by executive producer Tim Minear & director David Solomon<BR>9. \\"Ariel\\"<BR>10. \\"War Stories\\"<BR>   Commentary by actors Nathan Fillion & Alan Tudyk<BR>11. \\"Trash\\"<br />DISC FOUR: (picture of Gina Torres, \\"Zoe Warren\\")<BR>12. \\"The Message\\"<BR>   Commentary by actors Alan Tudyk & Jewel Staite<BR>13. \\"Heart of Gold\\"<BR>14. \\"Objects in Space\\"<BR>   Commentary by executive producer Joss Whedon<BR>Special Features:<BR> - Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly<BR> - Deleted Scenes<BR> - Serenity: The 10th Character<BR> - Alan Tudyk's Audition<BR> - Gag Reel<BR> - Joss Tours the Ship<BR> - Joss Sings the Firefly Theme<br />The episodes originally aired on the Fox television network starting with #2, \\"The Train Job\\", and continued in order through episode #9, \\"War Stories\\".  Then came #14, \\"Objects in Space\\", and (after the series had been cancelled) finally the pilot.  Fox has a long history of starting science fiction shows (usually on Friday evenings) but giving them only a short run before yanking them off the air.  Skipping the pilot of \\"Firefly\\" didn't help the show gain a following.  (Remember \\"Werewolf\\", \\"Alien Nation\\", \\"The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.\\", \\"M.A.N.T.I.S.\\", \\"VR.5\\", \\"Strange Luck\\", \\"Space: Above and Beyond\\", \\"Kindred: The Embraced\\", \\"Brimstone\\", \\"Harsh Realm\\", \\"Freaky Links\\", \\"Dark Angel\\", or \\"The Lone Gunmen\\"?  All of these were Fox shows; most of them were cancelled shortly after their debut.)  The DVD collection restores the shows to their proper order.<br />For a short-lived series, \\"Firefly\\" had a respectable assortment of guest stars.  Recurring villains include Mark A. Sheppard as \\"Badger\\", Michael Fairman as \\"Niska\\", and Christina Hendricks as \\"Saffron\\"/\\"Bridget\\"/\\"Yolanda\\"/whoever.  More notable one-shot guests include Edward Atterton, Richard Brooks, Richard Burgi, Melinda Clarke, William Converse-Roberts, Larry Drake, Gregg Henry, Isabella Hofmann, and Carlos Jacott.  Viewers of Joss Whedon's other shows will spot several familiar faces.<br />\\"Firefly - The Complete Series\\" is a 5-star entertainment package, with plenty of additonal material for fans of the series.  The actual production of the 4-DVD set is disappointing in several ways, though.  Pioneer Disc Manufacturing Corporation (PDMC) did their usual annoying job of arranging the DVD menus using a number of phantom \\"titles\\" that cause slow, repeated disc seeks for each menu selection.  They've also buried the many disc commentary selections three levels deep under \\"Language Selection\\".  On the positive side all the chapter stops are placed properly, and the video and audio transfer are both good.<br />\\"Here's How It Was: The Making of Firefly\\" includes commentary by all nine of the cast.  Gina Torres appears in costume, speaking of her character in the present tense; all the others came back after cancellation to add their remembrances of the show.  Also in this retrospective are Joss Whedon, Tim Minear, Jane Espenson, producer Gareth Davies, Chris Buchanan (President of Mutant Enemy), Chinese translator Jenny Lynn, Kelly Wheeler (assistant to the producer), camera operator Allen Easton, visual effects supervisor Loni Peristere, associate producer Lisa Lassek, and composer Greg Edmonson.<br />The fact that they could get nine different people to come back to provide audio commentary for the DVD collection, and as many more for the retrospective of the series, is a strong indication of the commitment these people have for \\"Firefly\\".  Let's hope the anticipated Firefly movie gets to fruition!

It provides an in-depth look at the history of Christianity and many secret societies that still exist today.  It also explains how through centuries of propaganda, many ancient pagan rituals and symbols for life and beauty were misconstrued and demonized by the early church in order to convert the masses.  If you are looking to read a book that is impossible to put down, and also learn a thing or two in the process, The Da Vinci Code is for you.

You can get plot details from the other reviews.  <br />It was interesting to see the film post-Columbia: for example, the issue of telling the astronauts whether there was a particular problem came up as a small dramatic moment, and the flight commander (the Ed Harris figure) decided not to tell them because the astronauts could do nothing about it, anyway.  Was it ethical for NASA to keep the astronauts in ignorance of their chances?  There were lots of problems they >could< do something about, however.  The representative from Grumman (the movie presents Grumman as the manufacturer of the LEM (Lunar Excursion Module) that is the astronauts' shelter on the way back to earth) is featured 2 times asserting his ignorance of the LEM's ability to fire its rockets for any purpose other than landing on the moon.  This concern with corporate liability stands in contrast to the other engineers' focusing on using available resources to make the craft do something that differs greatly from the original mission plan.  One of the great subplots of the movie shows how a little duct tape, some spare parts, and a lot of ingenuity can compensate for unexpected demand on the air-cleaning system.<br />I think the movie intends to show that individuals display heroism and that great achievement entails great risk for some, but also that great technical achievements float on the collaborative work of thousands of people.  The mass of engineers at NASA are white-shirted, sideburn-wearing, narrow-tie sporting problem-solvers, completely subsuming their individual egos to the collective task of \\"getting them home.\\"  It is compelling to see the astronauts turn off their computer and follow \\"Newton's laws\\" on their way back to Earth; from the perspective of  2004, their \\"computer\\" display looks less sophisticated than pong (that dates me!).  In general, the showcasing of antique technology (31 years old) is really cool, from the TV-camera cockpits at launch to the bizarre analog gauges in the command module (like my mom's diet scale from the 1970s), to the computer displays with their elementary graphics.<br />My first memory of TV is watching the moon landing; near this anniversary of the Columbia disaster, it is bittersweet to watch this story of disaster averted.  The romantic appeal of stepping on Mars aside, I'm relieved that amazing advances in computers and robotics permit us to explore the solar system \\"better, faster, cheaper\\" by keeping people here at home.<br />This movie would be a 5, except the depiction of women was so lousy as to be irritating.  Did the mom really let a 5 year old watch what might have been his dad's incineration on re-entry to the earth's atmosphere?  Did moms really let their kids listen to the TV pundits who emphasized the long odds?  I applaud any woman engineer making her way in the world.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I love Bill Murray. I love Scarlett Johannson. Still, I was counting down the minutes until the DVD was over. Watching two downbeat characters mope about lives overly contrived by a screenwriter (yet somehow incredibly unimaginative) is not my idea of a good film. For something truly profound, with a profoundly moving character in a terribly lost life, see &quot;Five Easy Pieces.&quot; For something imaginative and truly philosophical, with a lost soul who manages to connect with another lost soul (at least for a while), see &quot;Donnie Darko.&quot;
0307120007|1.0|If I'd been able to see inside this book, I would not have bought it. I'm not influenced by nostalgia, so I can state that this is a really disappointment. Pages are ordinary card folded accordion style and bound only in the middle by flat binding leaving the ends unbound. Really easy to pull out and doesn't stand up to any mouthing. For 'simple line drawings' read simplistic line drawings in pastel colors. I can imagine that sixty years ago, this book would've been revolutionary, now its just passe. Baby boy, after two weeks is bored silly with it and refuses to finish reading it. He does however do two or three of the activities before lunging for one of his other books. By the way, the book is not about a bunny named Pat. Also the book comes gift boxed and shrinkwrapped which is why I couldn't return it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd has brought back real hip-hop. Kanye West combines amazing lyrics with great beats. This cd is just a preview of Kanye West because he already planned 3 more albums. I cant wait to hear more because no matter what kind of rap or hip-hop you like, you will love this cd , its one of the best cds in a while.
B00009ATIX|3.0|More of an an excercise in filmaking taking on an atmosphere of Kubrick's 2001:A SPACE ODESSY (the DVD cover of Clooney in the space helmut looks exactly like the picture of Kier Dullea in one of the movie poster/stills of SPACE ODESSY). SOLARIS is a real downer considering Clooney and Soderbergh had just worked together on OCEAN'S 11.  This is a frustrating story about lost love and regret, almost like a depressing GROUNDHOG DAY reliving the death of a loved one over and over again. Clooney plays Chris Kelvin, a psychologist sent to a remote space station to investigate problems with the crew and finds out that they are being visited by &quot;ghosts&quot;. He too gets a visit from his dead wife and it is to no surprise that he he still mourning her death which makes it all the more painful.  This is another in a line of stories where man wants to destroy out of the fear of the unknown.  The standout character is that of &quot;Snow&quot; one of the surviving crew members on the space station, played to quirky perfection by Jeremy Davies. Otherwise, the rest of the performances and characters are too painful to watch in this depressing film.
B00009ATKS|5.0|Another great one.  It's all about the way they mix the sounds together, they repeat harmonics on and on, then add more sounds  again and again until it becomes grandiose, suddently they shift to something else.  The best exemple would be song &quot;Ratts of the capital&quot; starts with one looping guitar, second guitar comes in with some langourous melodies then a nice bass entering in a similar way as the looping guitar and finally a soft drum.  After that point, some other percussions are added like xylophone and everything becomes not defined and kind of confused but so gigantic.  They shut down most of instruments and start over their stratagem shifting to something else.<br />My favorites: &quot;Hunted by a freak&quot;, &quot;Ratts of the capital&quot;, &quot;Killing all the flies&quot;, &quot;Stop coming to my house&quot;.<br />They just turn classical music to rock and propelled it to space.
B000002GJ7|5.0|This band has a great sound and this album is one of their best.<BR>I have long since been a Extreme fan and this album is my fav.<BR>Nuno is awesome and a god on guitar, while Gary hits the notes just perfect.<br />I can tell you this much I wish they were still together still playing music, but at least we have their old music to listen to and admire.
020530902X|5.0|The Elements of Style by Strunk and White remains within easy reach some 23 years after I started earning my living as a writer and editor. Despite attempts by many pundits to displace this venerable guide, it remains solidly perched at the top of the heap of texts on writing and editing.<br />This book endures for many reasons, including the clear, concise prose that strikes to the heart of the matter; splendid examples that do not try to be cute; and short imperatives that codify the essence of good writing.<br />No copy editor can go forth unless armed with this book, and any writer striving to deliver an understandable message likely has a dog-eared copy lying about.<br />These precepts about clarity, correctness, and conciseness cut across all disciplines. Hence, this vigorous defense of clear writing is needed more than ever as a tidal wave of information, most of it ill-conceived, openly manipulative, and poorly written, floods our consciousness.<br />Having an enduring touchstone such as The Elements of Style available helps one write better and dismiss boorish drivel more easily.
B0001AP12G|5.0|KANYE is HIP-HOP!  His beats are as hott as the Neptunes, if not hotter, and his lyrics are amazing.  Hott ass songs, amazing musical guests, and funny ass skits!  You need to cop this album, meng.  NOW!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Readers...keep in mind that all those one star reviews are most likely people to don't believe in giving Britney Spears a chance.  For what reason, I don't know.  Had this CD been released by a different artist, it would get tons of 5 star reviews and better reviews from critics, simply because it is Britney.  I think that people should actually listen to the album before writing a review.  It just shows how much hatred they have for an entertainer for no reason...that's just wrong! <br />\\"In The Zone\\" is overflowing with satisfying beats and song structures.  The opening track, and underrated first single, \\"Me Against The Music\\" is nothing but an enjoyable dance track.  It takes some getting used to, but once you love it you never look back.  This song gets very infectious after recurring listens.  The song is a #1 dance single on its own, with no remixes.  \\"(I Got That) Boom  Boom\\" can only be described as nothing but fun.  The Ying Yang Twins offer their animal-like shouts and raps to add flavor to this southern hip-hop song.  While the Twins' rap gets a little repetitive, it's still enjoyable.  The beat will get you dancing in no time.  \\"Showdown\\" is an appealing song with interesting lyrics about make-up sex (\\"After the screaming's at an end, why don't we do it all again, that's when the fun really begins...\\").  It does indeed have a \\"popcorn\\" feel to it, as one reviewer said.  Now let's move on to the treasure that is \\"Breathe On Me.\\"  Out of all the dance/club songs out there, it's pretty amazing that nothing matches this one.  The alternately thumping single beats that is familiar in club scene goes great along with Britney's slow, quiet, seductive vocals.  The whispering in the middle of the song (\\"Monogamy's the way to go...just put your lips together...and blow\\") is the greatest guilty pleasure...ever.  It makes the whole song, in my opinion, even more compelling.  The point of this song is obvious: To get you in the mood.  \\"Early Mornin'\\" holds wonderful, \\"sensual swaying beats that come and go like a slow inhalation\\", as quoted by Blender magazine.  This song is basically about going out and partying all night with your friends and waking up with a hangover.  \\"Toxic\\", the current second single, as well as the most successful since 2001's \\"Stronger\\", is A-D-D-I-C-T-I-V-E.  It's got a kick-ass dance beat along with strings and guitars...did I mention the unbelievably remarkable chorus?  Plus, the lyrics are original and smart.  Originally lined up to be the first single off this album, \\"Outrageous\\" is a fun and upbeat R&B track containing lyrics about Britney's not-so-private life, being surrounded by paparazzi and media 24/7.  The chorus has catchy chants repeating \\"OUTRAGEOUS!\\"  This would do well as a later single.  \\"Touch Of My Hand\\" is a very controversial song since it is about...um...well, here's what Britney stated: \\"It's about you...with yourself.\\"  Nonetheless, the song is totally listenable.  It's mid-tempo with an Asian flavor.  Though other songs have had the same meaning/subject, this Britney number is truly original in its sound and crafty, smart lyrics.  A mainstream song with an Asian influence is rare in the U.S. market.  Also, Britney's vocals are good throughout the song, especially near the end.  I swear, in \\"The Hook-Up\\", I thought I would hear Sean Paul rapping any moment in the beginning because of the Reggae/Jamaican vibe he has in his music.  It resembles Beyonce's \\"Baby Boy\\" but with a faster rhythm.  Okay, who the hell does someone who says Britney can't sing think he is?  She clearly can, and she proves it on the 10th track and first ballad on the album, \\"Shadow.\\"  This track is dark and moody.  She sings about someone she loved but he didn't love her back in the same way.  As the song reaches its climax, Britney lets out her voice and it soars.  I believe she has the potiental to do even more than that.  Remember... she does upbeat dance stuff, so a powerful voice isn't needed.  But it's good enough.  \\"Brave New Girl\\" is a very fun, futuristic song.  She raps along an urban techno beat in the verses, while the chorus reminds you of the \\"old\\" Britney in its teenybopper-ish catchyness.  It was quoted by Rolling Stone that this song is better than anything Madonna has done in the past decade.  Though one might debate that opinion, it is an encouraging and powerful statement.  After all, Britney IS the next Madonna, right?  Finally, the last track in line...a dreamy piano ballad written by Miss Spears herself.  This song is about a lost love and she tries to forget him but she can't because their love was so powerful.  Hmm...Justin? (Can't stand him, by the way).  The piano sound would make Vanessa Carlton or Norah Jones look mediocre.  Another talent of Britney's...yes, she thought up this melody and rhythm, and played the piano.  Combining the sad piano sounds and Britney's great vocals, this song should put you in a calm or depressed mood.  Probably her most beautiful song to date.  <br />Overall, \\"In The Zone\\" is a masterpiece to people who like pop, techno, dance, R&B, trance, and hip-hop.  If you don't like any of those music styles, don't review and waste your time.
B00008PW2E|1.0|I'm posting this with the hopes that the $$$ grubbers at HBO might get a clue. I'm American, but live in Spain so any HBO subscription is out the question for me. However, I'm more than willing to pay the (IMHO overpriced to start with) $$$ to order the second season of SFU on DVD. Afer patiently waiting for the past 7 months or so, I've had it. I'm going to be forking over the $$$ for other (non HBO) series instead of SFU. I know I'm just one customer and the loss of my $$$ certainly won't cause the execs at HBO to have to drop their country club memberships, but someone has gotta make a stand. Maybe if we, the customers, finally so &quot;NO&quot; to being the money pawns of big business, then they will get a clue because it will hit them where it counts - in the corporate wallet.<br />Sigh....
B00018D44U|4.0|I agree with a couple of the reviewers that this CD is disappointing. This isn't even jazz anymore. Its more country. I loved CAWM, but I was so saddened by this CD. I was expecting a very good album. Its okay if you really like Norah, but for those who are still new to her, try avoiding this CD like the plague. No I'm just kidding, its not that bad. Buy the CD and see if you'll like it, just don't expect it at the top of my CDs of the year list in 2005.
B00005JMGL|5.0|I'll admit, there are some very -VERY- bad parts in this movie (The I DO BELIEVE chant...heh) but those of you complaining that this isn't like the book prooooobably didn't read it all the way. They did change, add, and remove lots of scenes, but no movie doesn't. As far as content and characters, this meets the book fairly well. Those who say this was vulgar, violent, and dark: I have news: THE BOOK WAS VULGAR, VIOLENT AND DARK in some places! The book was fierce and fiery, and every adaptation so far has been lighthearted beyond reason. The boy who played Peter did so wonderfully. He had spunk, cockiness, charm, sorrow, and (a refreshing change) the fact that he's MALE all added up to make him a good choice. I didn't like the girl who played Wendy purely for visual reasons (her face is all unproportionate, it scared me). Otherwise, all the characters were excellent looking. The costumes closely matched the book, most of the scenes were pretty good, the fight scenes were nearly realistic, and there was humor, sadness, loss, regret, redemption, forgiveness, and love - all the aspects of a good children's movie. Definitely worth seeing if you loved the book.
0385504209|2.0|Review:  Popcorn poppycock<br />The premise of Da Vinci Code shows promise: grisley murders, a secret set to shake the foundations of Christendom, and a series of (sometimes too easy) puzzles -- a &quot;Whereisit&quot; grafted onto a &quot;Whodonit&quot; connected to a &quot;Whatreallyhappened.&quot;  While Brown has no stylistic or descriptive talent whatsoever (you'd never want to read this book twice, that's the test), he did keep the juices flowing for me one time through.  (So long as I pushed the &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; meter up to its highest setting.)<br /><br />The book's many inanities and historical blunders are hard to overlook, however.  Brown doesn't know (what one embarrassed pagan historian pointed out) that fear of witches was a traditional part of European paganism, that this fear was squelched by the Church during the &quot;Dark Ages&quot; and then revived during the Renaissance; that tens of thousands, not &quot;five million&quot; witches were killed; or that these crimes occurred mostly in small towns on the margins of State and Church power, not in the shadow of the Vatican.  Ironically, Brown himself exploits the psychological mechanism that launches witch hunts in his choice of villains.  I myself am neither Catholic, albino, nor physically handicapped; but I find Brown's inability to rise above such pernicious type-casting unfortunate.  And his attempt to get inside the minds of his characters is marvelously shallow.  One half expects them to jump out of the book and cry, &quot;Hang on!  If I were this stupid, how did I get to be a Harvard professor / Catholic bishop / successful criminal?&quot;<br />As for Brown's chatter about early Christian history, lost Gospels, Church conspiracies, and the cover-up of Jesus' marriage to Mary Magdelene, which he and some rather breathless reviewers manage to take seriously, I admit I found his historical blundering mildly entertaining.  For the record, though, the Dead Sea scrolls do NOT contain any Gospels (one scholar claims to have found a few words from the Gospel of Mark in one cave, but that is disputed).  As for the so-called &quot;Gnostic Gospels,&quot; Philip Jenkin's Hidden Gospels is a good place to start.  Discovery of the Nag Hammadi documents rather proves the wisdom of the early Christians in dumping these bogus 2nd and 3rd Century writings: Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John show every sign of historicity (as well as socially constructive thinking), and these rather spacey New Age works show no more of either than the Da Vinci Code itself.<br />Still, in a mindless mood, it is possible to enjoy this book.<br />Author, Jesus and the Religions of Mantain any Gospels (one scholar claims to have found a few words from the Gospel of Mark in one cave, but that is disputed).

078881172X|2.0|I would have given this a single star (or none if possible) except for a few redeeming qualities. Before I rant, I'll admit that it wasn't -all- bad. First, I liked Peter's voice, it captured his spirit very well. Second, I liked John and Michael, very cute. Third, I liked Nana. That's all I liked. Okay, first of all, this movie was NOTHING like the story! The only similarities were the fact that there was a Peter, a Wendy, mermaids, Hook, etc, but none of them seemed to have the same personality as in the book! Wendy was horribly annoying in the movie, and only slightly so in the book. Tinkerbell was portrayed pretty well in this version (spiteful and jealous of Wendy) but they skipped the fact that she mended their differences. In the movie, Peter is a fairly normal type of boy. In the book, he's wonderful, cocky, strong, and smart. The Lost Boys were just very different in the book. In the movie, they were cartoony, stupid, and slow, unlike the book. I agree that the portrayal of the redman was sort of incorrect in the movie, but it wasn't so different in the book. There was respect in both, although I think the visuals were slightly insulting. Hook was also very ugly in the movie, and described as very cold and attractive in the book. Overall, it just insulted me how unlike the book it was. If you loved the book, don't inch near this movie. If you haven't read it, then proceed to this movie...at your own risk!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|Wow!  Where to begin??  Side A is incredible, with &quot;Here Comes the Sun,&quot; one of the best Beatles tunes ever, but the real beauty comes on Side B.  The meddley of &quot;story-style&quot; songs, flowing from one to the next, is just amazing.  My favorite album!
B000002AP1|5.0|This album made me an Iggy Pop fanatic.  I bought this album because I bought and enjoyed the Stooges first album.  That first album though in no way prepared me for how much I'd enjoy this album.  The way this album gets my blood racing, the catchy guitar licks, the sick visceral voice and lyrics...this album is STILL ahead of it's time even today.  I think groups of today are not only trying to recreate this sound, they're struggling to KEEP UP WITH IT.  Highly recommended.
B00001MXXH|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this!  No matter how many times I see it, I'm still laughing!  It will always be my favorite movie of all time!
B00013PHGS|3.0|This album is a good, but not great.  All the songs are pleasant and a few are exceptional, but overall it just sounds like an extension of their debut Moon Safari, only not as good.  Not much new ground being broken for the duo here, although I guess it's understandable based on the poor reaction to their last two more experimental efforts.  Still a good purchase, but if you already own Moon Safari, nothing here will really catch you off-guard.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|The matrix revolutions is the greatest action movie of all time. This film is way better than Lord of the Rings 3. No matter what peoople say about the acting, effects, and story it is still the greatest movie ever. I recently read the review for the DVD and they gave the audio and picture quality 10 out of 10 witch is awesome.This is a masterpiece movie and will remain a classic forever. Although it will take three times to watch the movie and fully understand it, at the end it is worth it. The end is fine. Everything is answered but you have to pay attention and some of the answers will be in the first two movies. This will always remain my favorite movie and trligy of all time.<br />By the way, it wups the Lord of the Rings butt by far! Lord of the Rings suck
B00006BTCA|3.0|This band has a lot of potential, and the songs are well-crafted.  The only reason I didn't rate them higher is because I feel like they are a little overwhelmed by their influences, and don't have enough of an original voice shining through.  The 80s throwback, faux-British sound they use gets tired after repeated listening, but this is still an enjoyable listen.
0393317552|1.0|Diamond's clearly stated thesis is that geography is the great determiner of human destiny, though, weirdly, it is left out of the title of the book.  The book actually has little to say about the three items of the title, but rather focuses on the natural resources available to different regions of the world, the animals that could be domesticated, and the possibilities for communicating with other adjacent cultures.  In line with the current passion for multiculturalism, he argues that the people involved are pretty much all equivalent, and that there are no important racial differences that need to be considered.<br />He dismisses the work of the psychometricians whose data, in spite of the taboos of our current state, reveal in hundreds of studies that people's intelligence vary by racial group.  He throws out this data, incredibly, based on his own assessments of personal experience with different peoples.  In fact, he baldly states his belief that stone age peoples such as New Guineans (whom he knows something about) are actually on average more intelligent than white Europeans.  One more example of introspective speculation and personal, anecdotal experience being being mistaken for hard data that can be replicated, graphed, statistically analyzed, and added to by studies with improved methodologies.<br />His attack on such an important question as IQ and the &quot;wealth of nations&quot; is weak,  unconvincing, unscholarly, colored by political correctness, and short.<br />In order to see the importance of geography and race, Diamond might have considered comparing the development over the last few hundred years of the peoples on the islands of Hispaniola and Iceland.  Try spending a couple of hours with your browser aimed at the CIA fact book, Google's pictures, and a few other readily available sources, then tell me why you think geography is the prime mover in the fate of nations!<br />His hopes of helping to see history become more scientific, argued in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious.  Really important questions about the history and destiny of man can and should be attacked by scientific methods, and perhaps Diamond's accretion of observations and speculations do serve as a sort of start, something like how alchemy started chemistry.in his last chapter, though, certainly is meritorious.

B000003S5H|5.0|It's rare that an album can be simultaneously so stimulating and relaxing.  Great beats, hooks, and sound effects.  Very trippy stuff, great to space out to.  Sounds retro and new at the same time.  An album that must be experienced.
B000001FTD|5.0|I don't know why I'm writing a review of Among The Living.  Any thrash or classic metal fan already owns this, has heard it, and basically already knows what I'm gonna say.  But I recently dusted this off and gave it a listen after about five years or so.  I really don't know why I waited so long.  I gotta tell ya, even though I've heard it a million times throughout the years, it really blew me away.  It's heavy, fast, cathcy, and doesn't take itself 100% seriously;  All the perfect fixins for a good album.  Most say that this is the best Anthrax ever got, and I must say I agree with them.  I do admire them for surviving throughout the years and staying heavy without selling themselves out, but lets be honest here-they'll never be this good again.  P.O.T. was the closest they came.  Like I said, I'm probably not telling you anything new, but if you just happen to be new and interested, listen to the other reviewers.  They all know what they're talking about.
B000005IU1|4.0|Given when this album came out, it must have been way out of left field for it's time.  Not as great as the following two albums Funhouse and Raw Power, but the hints of future greatness are definitely there.  This album is worth it just for the song \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" and \\"1969\\" alone.  Buy this album.
B0000DG00B|4.0|There seem to be basically two categories of music lovers in this world:  those that enjoy pristine studio albums, and those who love the energy and spontaneity of a live recording ( warts and zits intact ).  To address another reviewer's speculation, outdoor shows wreak havoc on guitar tuning...humidity, temperature extremes, etc...probably why these tapes were relegated to some shelf for over three decades. Tom Dowd was justifiably sure that they could achieve far better results recording at an indoor venue, and that was amply demonstrated at the Fillmore East shows.  That said, these recordings shine in their own way!  For one thing, I love the fact that there are no annoying fades between songs  ( a Tom Dowd staple ).  On the Fillmore East album, this always destroyed the continuity of the concert for me  ( and Dowd would continue this habit with the two &quot;Evening With...&quot; CD releases).  He rectified it somewhat during the early ninties with the revamped and expanded &quot;Fillmore Concerts&quot;, but still deleted the casual chatter between songs.  Again, people either like this editing or they don't.  One of the things that's always appealed to me about the ABB is how down to earth these guys have always been.  This long-overdue release of their Atlanta performances beautifully captures the essence of a typical show!  And, having seen them myself in 1981 during the &quot;Toler Era&quot;, their stage demeanor doesn't change:  these guys, regardless of incarnation or era, are the same unpretentious rockers that smoke the stage with every performance.  No star trips.  If intonation and &quot;irritating chatter&quot; are annoying, you should stick to the studio albums.  Hearing the occasional bum note actually lends a sense of authenticity for me...I know that, chances are, this is a true representation of exactly what went down at the show  ( no doubt Pink Floyd, had they been rained on, would've edited that &quot;glitch&quot; out, along with every syllable they deign to utter to their audience! ). In this day and age of Pro Tool editing, cut and paste &quot;fixing&quot; of so-called &quot;live&quot; albums, I find this decades-old chestnut from the Lions of Southern Rock very refreshing indeed.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I can't rave enough about this album, it's SO damn good.  The soaring vocals, long twisting melodies, the creepy spirituality of the total package...it's a tight album from beginning to end.  You can just lay back in dark room and let the music wash over you, it's one of those rare albums that can actually transport you to another time and place.  Definitely not for everyone, I'd classify this as an album that you'll either love or hate.  Hard to categorize, but it has shades of Led Zeppelin and Rush, but a little more psychadelic and electronic.
B000069AUI|1.0|Coldplay's parachutes was a fantastic change to mainstream music, but the follow up was so typical. A Rush of Blood to the Head is exactly what one would expect from a millenium rock band. I disagree with people saying they ripoff pink floyd, they are far from such rock icons. This album is boring and has the most unoriginal and typical vocal melodies of a modern album, I think that I have heard this album redone 5 times. And the guy that said there hasn't been a good band out of england sense the sex pistols is missing out on the cure which are absolutely fantastic, robert smith will never let one down unlike chris martin.
B000001FMX|4.0|This is one of the great pre-punk Albums, along with MC5, the Velvets and the Stooges albums.  Great hooks and riffs, raw energy, short, sweet and unpretentious songs, this album is a great listen for start to finish.  When listening to this album and keeping in mind when it came out, it becomes obvious how influential this group was to later hard rock and glam metal bands.

His research is so well grounded that it is difficult to identify any gaps in his findings.  Some of his findings are controversial and he discusses these at the end of his book in an honest and open way.<br />We would have liked the book to have even more detail: more stories, biographies, data, and analysis since it was so well written.  The \\"great\\" companies and their comparison companies offer incredibly rich environments for the research - we especially enjoyed the discussions of Nucor and Bethlehem Steel.<br />The reader should take time to reflect and personalize the \\"Hedgehog Concept\\" and identify where their three circles intersect.  It may take some time and it may even require the reader to reread the book; but these central concepts are crucial for personal and professional growth.  <br />We look forward to Collin's future works.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|In my opinion, this is a good album from DT.  They keep experimenting stuff and prove a successful evolution.  Although ToT has similarities with Awake and 6DOIT, it is heavier soundwise yet progressive as ever.  I would be bored if they kept putting out albums of same nature / style over and over again.  Moreover, I strongly disagree with those who claim that this is a \\"nu-metal\\" album.  All members perform great, expect some riffs and solos lack the melodic creativity they used to have.  All in all, I enjoy this album and look forward to seeing them live in Istanbul again!
B00005JMTQ|5.0|A super movie with great performances by Jack Nicolson and Diane Keaton.  Keanu Reeves is nice in a supporting role.  You'll laugh and me touched by some serious moments.  And like another reviewer stated, its not too heavy.<br />I guess the morale of the movie is that relationships are complex.  However, if both parties keep an open mind and heart, magic can happen.<br />Anyway, check this one out for sure Amazon readers.  Jack can sure brighten up a screen as he ages just fine like a good bottle of wine.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears really came out an really awesome dance album. It's not pop anymore. It's more... hip hope and dance/trance. I really love this cd. It could be another top seller of the year. I still don't think people give enough respect to Britney. She really did try for a better album... and you can tell. IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN HER OTHER 3 ALBUMS!<br />Me Against The Music 4/5: If this track didn't have Madonna, It would have been better. I don't know why, It's just that Madonna's voice sounds...out of place on here. But I really love the beats. Its really hott, check it out.<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom 5/5: It's one of the best songs on this album. The Ying Yang Twins really make this trakc sexy. And it's a great Grindin' track. <br />Showdown 4/5: Basically this whole song is just Britney talking and singingthe chorus! But the lyrics are pretty good and the song is really upbeat.<br />Breathe On Me 5/5: First, i really didn't see the point in listening to this song. But after a few weeks, i listened to it...and now im ADDICTED! Britney's voice is really raspy and kind of low. And it sounds like one of those rave songs. Its something you would listen to while you have the lights turned off with your lover. Its Great! This songs a trance/dance song.<br />Early Mornin' 4/5: This ones okay. Its kinda really like all the songs on here. So its...boring. STILL NICE BEAT!<br />Toxic 5/5: Her single right now. It's my favourite song. I really like the \\"bollywood\\" strings. And the beat is futuristic. This, i feel is one of the more poppy song on this album.<br />Outrageous 3/5: I don't like the start of this song. R.Kelly wrote this song. The song is boring too. The chorus is played over and over and over through out the song!!!<br />Touch Of My Hand 5/5: Another favourite of mine. This song's about having fun with yourself when you're alone (masturbation) and she says how it's not a sin or anything. I like the beat. Its really Tranced up.<br />The Hook Up 3/5: This song'smediocre. I like the beat but the singing's not very impressive. I can't tell what shes trying to say half the time. and its hard to sing to. I like the chorus. CATCHY!<br />Shadow 3/5: This song's suppose to be slow, and its not. Well i dont think its slow. Theres no beat. And Its Just kind of ugly.<br />Everytime 5/5: So sad. It's to Justin Lumberfake...er....Timberlake. I really like the melody. SHE WROTE IT. ITS SO BEAUTIFUL. Just listen to it. You will love it.<br />ME Against The Music (remix) 5/5: I like the beat. Its just the original version added with alota new beats. I really like it...Lots of Scratchin on here. Its really up beat.<br />I Think This cd's really good. I think it's an cd that you'll play at all your parties and dances. Its just..irresistable. I love it..and i think everyone will too (well...people who like dancing and this kind of music)
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt is quickly becomming one of my favorite new bands.  On Rock Steady Gwen, Tony, Tom, and Adrian provide a diverse sampling of modern rock, hip hop, ballads, and even reggae.  More importantly these songs are all loaded with many catchy hooks.<br /> The sound stays fresh from start to finish.  I just adore the reggae flavored Underneath It All.  The rap part fits in like a hand in a glove.  The title track also has some pleasing reggae tones and soothing harmonies.  In My Head is another soft soothing jazz flavored tune.  Platinum Bloinde Life is a cool edgy rocker.  And there so many good dance oriented tunes.  These guys no how to use the hip hop beat without betraying their New Wave Rock N Roll roots.  Some clever lyrics as well.<br />Its amaxing how many people feel betrayed by the slight change in No Doubt's sound from earlier works.  Truthfully this is a band that wants to grow.  And they definitely grow for the better.  I say that in an age of here again gone tommorow stars like Sugar Ray, No Doubt is one band that will be a permanent force in the future of contemporary music.
B00005LAIB|5.0|When I picked up this album I wasn't sure what to expect. I listened to aenema (there previous CD) when it came out and was astonished by that. I didn't think it was possible to do better then that album. Was I ever wrong. This CD is a masterpiece. I put it in my disc player sat back and the grudge starts. From here on in I couldn't move. The CD is more of an experience then just an album. I think you can only get the same effect from listening to songs off this album if you take it from the first song and just let it play. If you go on the net and download individual songs you WILL NOT get the same effect. <BR>Justin Chancellor - His bass lines throughout the album are incredible. He uses some sort of effect for most of the songs that I have never heard on a bass. Makes the instrument alot more interesting<BR>Adam Jones - The guitar riffs in this album consist of crazy effects and never done before riffs.<BR>Maynard James Keenan - What can I say? the best, brightest and most talented singer today? His voice is relaxing, erie, scary, angry all in one. On the grudge his scream is incredible.<BR>Danny Carey - Take a seat Travis Baker and learn a thing or two. Danny's drum beats are the best, most confusing, offbeat and just plain incredible I have ever heard in my life. His skills are incredible making Tool a lot more speacial then other bands<br />This album is the best album I have ever heard in my life. Linkin Park, Staind, Disturbed and more are an embarrassment compared to Tool. If your tired of the same old nu metal rock music that is out today and have heard that tool is &quot;just another nu metal band&quot; I disagree strongly and URGE you to listen to this album. You will never want to hear the short crappy riffs of Linkin Park or any other nu metal band again.<BR>-Kyle Banasiak
0140277447|5.0|Hey Yukizi. Read up you fool. Your father, uncle, grandfather, etc. and their contemporaries went abroad and killed millions and millions of defenseless people throughout Asia. Whenever you and idiots like you admit this and admit that your people were very, very evil in this point in history you can be respected by the rest of the human race. Until then you can live in denial and get NO respect for the rest of the planet. By the way, I live in Japan and am happy to MEET you anytime, anywhere. You S.O.B.<br />Sorry, had to get that out of the way. Now to the intelligent readers out there. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to know the truth about this horrifying period and event in human history. But it is not just a non-fiction horror story which makes the Nazis look like Boy Scouts. It is a tale of courage, the will to survive, and unselfish bravery which the world NEEDS to learn of. Truly a remarkable story. <br />Japanese right-wing politicians, Yakuza, and idiots like Yukizi have been tirelessly trying to bury this story for years.<br />Take the time to learn the truth. Maybe your interests will carry over to more current issues and cover-ups.
6305014140|5.0|It all started with &quot;Vampire Hunter D&quot;, then &quot;Ghost in the Machine&quot;, and now &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot;, which at least equals the other Anime DVDs I have seen thus far. I even picture certain cyberpunk books that I've read, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;, as being good candidates for the Anime transition. Each would prove extremely entertaining. So, come on, Anime writers and artists out there...turn at least one of these books (or all of them) into Anime presentations.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|I cryed.  Multiple Times.  I got it in the mail yesterday and I have since watched it three times.  This movie is up there with the Sci-fi eighties classic E.T.  Buy it, watch it, cry throughout the whole thing, and then look around you and smile because life is beautiful.
6305897786|3.0|A) Polanski obviously loved the book this movie is based on, &quot;The Club Dumas&quot; by Arturo Pérez-Reverte, so he decided to make a movie of it.<br />B) His script, written with John Brownjohn, tosses out HALF the plot, and half the reason for enjoying the work.<br />C) The film suffers, and, while enjoyable, is a much diminished work when compared to the book. So: READ THE BOOK, whether or not you've seen this movie before.<br />I like and respect Polanski, but he screwed up here-- Depp is the ideal Corso, but the film is a misfire only a little less ill-starred than Polanski's &quot;Pirates.&quot;
B00018D44U|4.0|Norah decidedly has taken her career down a newer path for this release.<br />While the voice is still characteristic &quot;Norah&quot; fans have come to love, more of this CD is more folk/country focused than her first release &quot;Come Away With Me&quot;.  Of course, there are a few songs that point back to her first release both in style and content.<br />This CD is packed with fun, more bluesy/folk songs and the traditional standards remenant of her first release. Norah works with the Handsome Band and does a song with Dolly Parton on this release that it sure to please even non-country fans.<br />For fans expecting a CD exactly like the first one, you might be up for a bit of a disappointment.  The older generation of Norah Fans might feel that this CD is a little more upbeat and funky in spots compared to her first CD but don't let that discourage as this album is definatly sure to please &quot;true&quot; Norah fans and maybe even impress a new group of fans.<br />For even more Bluesy, uptempo Norah I recommend trying &quot;The Peter Malick Group Featuring Norah Jones&quot;, &quot;New York City&quot; release.  She covers Bob Dylan and several other songs that make this CD really fan for anybody who enjoys listening to Norah.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I don't know about that just yet, but this album will definitely change the rap game for the better.  There's definitely no other album out there like this one.   Lyrically and beat-wise this is the most creative albums I've heard in years.  I would compare it to the male rap version of Lauryn's Miseducation of Lauryn Hill.  Kanye deserves his props for this one.  The best song to me is &quot;last call&quot; which is a toast to Rocafella and a tribute of sorts to Jay-Z.  At the end Kanye goes into detail about how he got his deal on the Roc. It's a good thing they signed him too, with Jigga retiring, he may be the reason Rocafella records stays relevant in the rap game. Cop this disc don't bootleg it.  Guaranteed to go 4xplatinum!!!!
0800141660|5.0|As I review movies I've seen, I'm beginning to realize how many movies I have gone into reluctantly.  I usually start with &quot;I really didn't want to see this movie...&quot;<br />For &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; things were a little different.  I was basically against all chic flicks the first time I watched this.  I had been bored out of my mind by countless Daniel Steel movies, Molly Ringwold movies, soap operas and whatever else my female friends enjoyed watching.  However, out of desperation one night (as it was the only movie in the apartment I hadn't seen), I popped this one in and expected to be asleep and out of my misery shortly.<br />As the movie starts you are introduced to a family conflict something in the Cinderella order.  A nice old man with money is dying.  He is limited by the law in providing for his 2nd wife and their daughters  because the entire estate needs to go to the son to be preserved.  Therefore, on his deathbed, he requests that his son (from his first marriage) looks after them.  However, this son has a wicked, wicked wife who talks him out of almost all support, and these gentlewoman have to pack up and live off the generosity of distant relatives.<br />And so sets up all the dynamics of a typical Austin work (as I have since learned): very cool gentlewomen who don't have the dowry to make them desirable matches.  Will any gentlemen be willing to sacrifice monetary gain for true love or will the women end up as old maids?<br />While that plotline has been at the core of many boring, cliche, catty, or empty Victorian films, what Emma Thompson (actress and screenwriter) has done with this one is pure magic. Rather than focus on how different the era was (the dress, the parties, the etiquette), Thompson sucks you in to the humanity of the characters themselves.  Yes, they dress differently and have different societal rules placed upon them.  But they feel and love and dream as we do.  She brings the whole world to life, showinghow people like us express themselves though the mediums they had at the time - through music, poetry, significant looks, walks, etc.<br />Marianne's (Kate Winslet) story is moving and heart-breaking because of the disillusionment of her youthful confidence and trust.  She represents the &quot;Sense&quot; in the movie - one who trusts her feelings and the feelings of her beloved.  She lives how we are often encouraged to live today - to do what feels right and to express everything.  Elinor's (Emma Thompson) role, on the other hand, is one of the most mature I've ever seen in a film.  As the &quot;Sensible&quot; sister, she follows the Victorian era values when it comes to confiding in others, expressing herself, and expecting anything from her true love (Hugh Grant).  Yet you see that she does this not out of mindless obedience but because she understands the wisdom behind such etiquette.  When her heart finally breaks in spite of all of her carefulness and reserve, yours breaks with her and I cried for the first time in years.<br />I don't want to spoil the ending (and don't worry, I haven't), but Thompson wraps this movie up to perfection.  She seems to have done everything perfectly in the film - from the timing, the character development, the resolution, etc.  Ever since I have seen this film, I have yeared for another to bring me to that era in a similar manner but have yet to find one.  There are some good ones out there, but nothing touches what was accomplished in this film!
B000002J03|5.0|When this album was being made, Led Zeppelin was firing on all cylindars.  They had just put out one of the best debut albums ever produced.  They decided to take their heavy bluesy swagger to the next level. The result was an album that surpasses their debut in intensity, swagger, and heaviness.  Led Zeppelin II was grittier than the first one to boot.  This album saw Robert Plant come into his own as a songwriter after barely participating in the writing of the first album.  On to the songs:  <br />We kick off with \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"- a killer track with a lot of swagger and awesome guitar playing by Jimmy Page complete with an interlude that will make your hair stand on end.  <br />Now we have \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\".  This is a great slow song with a heartfelt solo by Page.  Plant really shows his ability to write a song here.  This is a real breather after the previous song.<br />\\"The Lemon Song\\"  Another blues song in the spirit of their first album.  They borrowed a lot from Howlin' Wolf's \\"Killing Floor\\" which only serves to enhance the song.  It moves from slow and heavy to fast and heavy.<br />\\"Thank You\\"  A song that Plant wrote to his wife.  While being more laid back than anything else on the album, it (along with \\"Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You\\" from I) lay the groundwork for the acoustic stuff that Zeppelin would do later on, however, this particular track is not acoustic.<br />\\"Heartbreaker\\"-Great track.  The main riff is excellent and it puts forth the angst- ridden story about a woman.  Plant delivers a great vocal performance here.<br />\\"Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman)\\"-This is the weakest link on the album.  It is a good ditty but is hardly worthy of Zeppelin.  However it provides a short break from the angst-ridden heaviness that dominates the album<br />\\"Ramble On\\"-Plant's fascination with JRR Tolkien comes to the forefront with the mention of Mordor and Gollum.  This is a great song.  It shifts from a slower acoustic feel duringthe verses to a faster electric sound during the chorus.  <br />\\"Moby Dick\\"-John Bonham is the star on this one. It starts off with a little drum intro and a guitar verse by Page and then goes into a drum solo.  Bonham played some of these drums for this track with his bare hands.  This track gives you a glimpse into why this guy was amazing.  If you like this, you should hear it live.<br />\\"Bring it on Home\\"-The final track of the album is another blues song.  It starts of slow, with Plant playing harmonica and singing like he's Muddy Waters, and Page and Jones just strumming along.  Then it explodes into a fast rocker with the band out in force and reverting back to a slow tune right before the end again.  <br />If you want an album that helped define hard rock and heavy metal, get this album. This along with Deep Purple's Machine Head, Black Sabbath's Paranoid, Jimi Hendrix Are You Experienced, and Cream's Disreali Gears should give you an insight into the origins of rock and metal.
B00018D44U|5.0|In reviewing the comments placed on Amazon, one cannot help but notice that some music fans are becoming jaded with the recent trend to infuse Pop and Jazz. In 2003, Norah overtook the Grammys with her previous release. As a result of her commercial appeal and critical success, many major labels signed artists that would reflect and follow in JONES' musical footsteps. FEEL LIKE HOME is a CD as musically perfect as her last release. One cannot deny that JONES knows how to tenderly deliver a lyric. From the first chorus in SUNRISE, one can notice how her vocals remain both smoky and sweet.<br />If you enjoyed the last release, do not hesitate to purchase this cd. It is up to you to decide but I seriously doubt that you'll regret the purchase.
0393307050|5.0|This book was close to my heart, being a sailor myself and a bit of a history buff. The language was a mite flowery at times, but, English at the dawning of the 19th century WAS flowery. It did nothing to distract from the story, which was a lively yarn. The book was historically accurate as far as I could tell, and one of the few stories that mentioned an elm-tree pump. A pretty much unheard of piece of equipment.I reckon I'll have to read the whole series now, as this one was thoroughly enjoyable.
B0001AP12G|4.0|1.Intro - No comment here, Bernie Mack just talking bs<br />2.We Don't Care - An infectious chorus Backed by soulful beats and Kanye spitting about his struggles and the struggles of hood life.<BR>\\"ain't no tuition for having no ambition\\": Tight song 3.5/5<br />3.Graduation Day - Bernie still bsing so again no rating but great beat near end. Do wish it was kept the same as the advance.<br />4.All Falls Down - The Guitar chords literally gave me chills at first listen, Then add the soulful singing of Syleena Johnson(replacing Lauryn,I wish it was still ms hill.)This tracks has to be one of the best on this album. Self Conscience as called on the advance fits this right as Kanye spits about our own,and his,complex.Half a point was reduced because it seems to me that kanye was more emotional on the advance and L boggie just sounded so right. 4.5/5<br />5.Ill Fly Away - Nice little intro to spaceship,but again just a skit. I honestly wish all these skits would've been cut and \\"home\\" been put in instead but whatever.<br />6.Spaceshipft GLC and Consequence - Incredible track. No question. Kanye along with glc and consequence bless this song with everyday problems with jobs rap and life as a whole. A nice soothing chorus and an all around ill track.my favorte off this album as of now 5/5<br />7.Jesus Walks - I mean Damn. Kanye ripping normal singles to shreds on this. I never expected this as a second single.(heard it on radio the other day I'm guessing its the single) The Advance again seemed to be more emotional but the sound quality has multiplied by millions. I have to say the \\"they say you can rap about anything except for Jesus\\" was poorly constructed and didn't fit the rest of the flow at all, none the less tight track 4/5<br />8.Never Let Me Downft Jay z and J.Ivy - I'm starting to think hearing the advance might have ruined this album. Again the advanced seem so much more powerful. The sound is much better and The extra Jay verse is nice 2. This tracks finds Jiggapondering his life in hip-hop while Kanye just contemplates life. I really enjoyed the way the advance finished whereas this one doesn't have that Strong powerful ending the advance did. On the other hand the beat brakes after the third verse and the hook kicks in beautifuly and Jays last verse is bananas.One word Ill 4/5<br />9.Get Em High - This tracks features Common and Talib and for some reason its the weakest track on this album. Talib comes in for about half a verse or as kanye states \\"a couple of lines\\" Talib comes ok but nothing incredible I didnt oh or aw at all but flow was hott. Commons verse saves this song.Common comes hott spitting stuff like \\"They say hip-hop is dead im here to resurect me\\" even though Common does bring it with other lines like \\"hard to watch like madussa\\"his verse is still nothing to get that exited over. I wish he wouldve came on some watermelon type hit(it seems that mightve been his intention but he fell short) an aiight track at best 3/5 I really wanted to give it higher<br />10.Workout Plan(skit) - I got a six pac shakur you know' \\" im the botlegg queen Ill give it to you for free.99\\" funny but how many skits we gonna see??<br />11.The New Workout plan - \\"Ohh girl your mouth is harsh cover your mouth like you got sars\\" what the?? I guess I have to be impartial and this is creative. Nice club track but long so we all know this will start up a sweat. great beat I can picture females Jukin(SP,its not a word anyway)now. The females talking in the middle is hilarious and I can pictures women singing this joint at school already so its hott but since this is MY REVIEW,i will now stop being impartial Kanye sounds wack,not just that but he also sounds simple and keeps \\"instructing\\" it sounds like something on some Richard simones does hip hop 2/5<br />12.Slow Jams - By now everyone and my 9 year old cousin has heard and jammed to this. I dont think i need to explain so....3.5/5<br />13.Breathe in Breathe Outft ludacris - why does it say ft ludacris if hes only on the hook? this has to be the only track i wanted luda to spit in he woudlve sounded dope. \\"more of that bs ice rap I gotta apoligize to mos and talib\\" nice that he notices this is simple and overdone. with that said this is a normal simplstic I got jewels song with a bit of a twist with kanye saying stuff like \\"first n*** with a benz and a backpack\\" ok track for cars and if you like it but since its MY REVIEW\\" what you gonna buy next whatever the next trend is\\" what the atleast kanye knows hes messed up when he states\\"what the f was i on crack\\" but lines like \\"i always had a phd a pretty big ***\\" are unexcusable 2.5/5 <br />14.school spirit skit 1 - no comment<br />15.School Spirit - Tight hit which is good because i was starting to loose hope. The chorus is a definite anthem for college students and is an all around tight track like all these tracks kanye blesses our ears with a great beat 3.5/5<br />16.Another funny skit<br />17.Another funny skit<br />18.Two Wordsft Mos Def and Freeway - Sheer dopeness- Mos def-does more-then kill-the mic-its muredered-just wish-two words-was done-whole song. I understand why freeway and kanye coulndt though its hard haha. I honestly think freeway kills this and its obvious mos is the most skilled hopefully everyone else notices aswell.the choir in this is orgasmic so is the violin near the end I mean this track is two words -Just Dope- 5/5<br />19.Through The Wire - again most have heard this already but a tight track nonetheless 4/5<br />20.Family Buiseness - Again the advance seem so much better in the vocal department but still amazing track.on this track Kanye finds himself reminising on his family affairs and memories. great song and great emotion(on advance) 4.5/5<br />21.Last Call - this track clocks in at 12:40 still a nice LONG track. Most is just kanye talking and going through his life in the industry great track and a great finish 4.5/5<br />all in all this album is amazing great tracksand some tracks that to me seem off,but then again im sure some think the ones i loved are off aswell great album kanye walks the line of underground and superstar topics with ease.<br />mean of album = 3.7 which im rounding to 4 mics<br />This album proves Kanye might be the mc to stop this bs seperation of \\"underground and commercial\\"<br />Although not talented mic wise Kanye has the potential to be hip-hops savior.from what I am not sure,but everyone wants rap saved so here you go
B00009V7RF|3.0|An odd mix of styles, from pop to hip hop thru bhangra.  <br />Many of the tracks are predictable fillers, but &quot;the apl song&quot;, &quot;smells like funk&quot; and &quot;shut up&quot; make it worth giving a spin.
B0000035E7|5.0|in the land before commercialist-induced corruption, kurdt was able to walk as he pleased and write about what he wanted to.  He did not have to stoop to the level of the tabloids and etc. that tirelessly misjudged him by his actions when he wrote bleach because authenticity resides in obscurity.<BR>my favorite song is mr. moustache because it strongly portrays kurt's strongest philosophies concerning social corruption (but before you JUDGE you must read and correctly understand his comic of mr moustache which can be found in 'journals').<BR>nirvana had many great guitar riffs and it is inspiring to be able to take a heavy load off the shoulders of a weary, keen-eyed child.<BR>that's pretty corny isn't it? i do say so myself<BR>but the thing that sets nirvana apart from any other 90s band that made it big was that nirvana did not go with the media and publicity and instead, they represented what happens when they intrude too much.  They worked to the complete opposite of the corruption that typically surrounds people after they make big news in the entertainment world.  They won too.  In almost all of their songs, you hear about people swarming around them.  If you understand the lyrics and what they mean to songs like &quot;Radio Friendly Unit Shifter&quot; and especially &quot;Opinion&quot;(rare), you will see how strongly nirvana and kurt were opposed to all the lack of integrity in the world of journalism.
B0000028M7|5.0|There simply has never been a darker album ever created. The only ones that I can think are even close would be parnoid by sabbath or some of danzigs works. But these are almost campy compared to Layne's open tour of his own destruction. It's as if he has knowning chosen to sacrafice his soul to create one of the greatest hard rock albums. The rest the band seem perfectly intuned to his choice and determined to provide the darkest, richest and most engulfing background music. Anyone who has ever lost control of there life to addiction will be stunned by Layne's amazing, artistic, and haunting trip through the steps of his road to the enevitable. What may be most shocking, and also engrossing, is the constant foreshadowing of his own demise, and the seeming complete acceptance of it; without the sightest reference of fear, regret or remorse. There are some songs that step away of this subject, and they are just as amazing. Jerry Cantrell shows he has studied the masters of darkness; Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi, etc. and is no longer a student, but a contemporary. I was a fan of AIC when they first appeared and was disappointed by there strange &quot;disappearance&quot;. The rumors of Layne's struggles were tragically put to rest with his death, The total depth of his addiction; and how he had pushed away any hope; was emphasised by the sad fact that no one realized he was gone for over a week. A loss of an incredibe talent, I have to wonder if he knowing traded himself to create his masterpiece and a heavy metal album that will never be equaled.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I bought this album over a year or two ago. I had read the all the positive reviews, figured that I'd give the album a chance, and went out and bought it. When I started playing it I was a little bit disappointed. It wasn't bad but, other than Paranoid Android (which I thought was brilliant) and Subterranean Homesick Alien, none of it really sparked in me any interest. I put it aside, got into hip hop in a big way and didn't really listen to it for a year or so.<br />As you've probably figured out I recently picked the album up and listened to it from start to finish during a long road trip. I couldn't believe that I'd ignored this album for so long. It's simply a brilliant album from start to finish. It's an acquired taste and definitely won't be for everyone but its genius can not be denied. I wouldn't call this a Rock album; it's probably the best example of an alternative album you'll ever find.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George Harrison's best known songs come to life in this musical tribute directed by Eric Clapton.  Friends of George, some you never heard of, fill the stage to offer energetic and, a times, moving renditions of songs like Beware of Darkness, My Sweet Lord, Taxman, Something, Here Comes the Sun and many more.  For the Eric Clapton fans, his vocals and guitar playing were driven by genuine emotion over the loss of his close friend.  You could also sense the feeling of loss in Paul McCartney as he played George's favorite instrument, the uke, and sang &quot;Something.&quot;  Buy the DVD.

After going through the Xanth novels, all of Tolkien (including the lost tales etc.), Terry Brooks, and others, I found myself bored with the genre. Flat predictible plots were becoming pr for the course with the newer novels.  Yes, the writing was occaisionally good, but the series always ended in the same place and had little real depth.<br />This book, however, is complicated.  I would compare it favorably to Michael Chabons pulitzer prize winning &quot;Adventures of Kavalier and Clay&quot;.<br />The writing is good and the plot is thick.<br />Beware of this novel if you do not want to get too involved!!!<br />NOTE: READ THE NOVEL CAREFULLY (AS WELL AS THE SEQUALS) THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF FORESHADOWING, PROPHECIES, AND HINTS OF WHAT MAY COME.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie offers answers to any person in search of the secrets of life. The book stresses how one can be educated about life by others, especially elders, in addition to our own experiences. Furthermore, if one is positive then one will be able to see the learning opportunities behind ones difficult moments. Consequently, bad events change from only being about suffering to being about valuable life lessons. Mitch Alboms novel is an example of how to face life with courage and how to learn about life from ones hard times.<BR>The novel is a true account of a student and his professors conversations about life. Not long after Mitchs college graduation, he was inspired to throw himself deeply into his career. Gradually, Mitch lost contact with his mentor and professor, Morrie Schwartz, with whom he had a tight relationship. Through a coincidence, Mitch became reunited with his college professor and from that point, they agreed to meet on Tuesdays to discuss life. The novel describes their time together as they talk about life and its secrets.<BR> Tuesdays with Morrie, might be considered a self-help book, but it is not. The novel is quite different from other books that cover lifes issues since its format is simple, direct and it does not make one feel as if they are being preached to. In addition, the books topics are easy to relate to since they are practical and universal. Morries character is very inspiring since he has an optimistic and courageous attitude towards life, in spite of his obstacles. I learned a lot from Morries experiences, which have made me think about the meaning of life more. <BR> The main theme of the book is to love, forgive and live positively. Unlike most people, Morrie chose to look beyond his obstacles, have a positive attitude and express his love for his family and friends. Consequently, he was able to live happily and created an example for every reader to follow. The book is an emotional journey that I strongly recommend everyone to take.
B00018D44U|5.0|Having listened to Norah Jones' Feels Like Home, I now see that the Pete Malick CD was more than just a stopgap release for this long-awaited jewel, but more of what she could do.  While some of the songs have the same relaxing inflection and instruments as Come Away From Me, Norah introduces styles ranging from blues, folk, and even bluegrass.  And the presence of other instruments, such as strings, electric guitar, and Hammond organ shows her styling evolving.  Cute publishing name for her songs--Muthajones Music.<br />The pronounced rhythm section of slit drums and acoustic guitar on &quot;Sunrise&quot; make it a track that wouldn't make it on Come Away With Me.<br />The bluesy/country-ish  &quot;What Am I To You?&quot; with its electric guitar and Wurlizter electric piano is a throwback to her music with Pete Malick.  Here she asks in the chorus:  &quot;I'll love you when you're blue/but tell me darlin' true/what am I to you?&quot;<br />&quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; starts out with that melodic piano, backing drums and soft vocals in the same light jazz manner as &quot;Feelin' The Same Way&quot; from her debut.  Ditto for &quot;Carnival Town,&quot; which also sports a cello and viola.  The use of the carnival as an analogy for life is interesting, how one looks down as the ferris wheel reaches its apex, or the brief laugh a clown gives one, i.e. it's lonely at the top, and life goes on after the thrill of a brief moment is gone.  When Norah asks &quot;Is it lonely?/lonely/lonely&quot; in the chorus, I can sense a silent &quot;yes&quot; being answered within.<br />&quot;In The Morning&quot; is kind of uptempo jazz/folk number about the aftermath of an affair, with these clever lines:  &quot;Funny how my favourite shirt/smells more like you than me.&quot;  That Wurlitzer piano playing indeed reminds me of mellow 70's music.<br />The analogy of a swift current to life and the fish as everyone else who seems with it is shown in the introspective &quot;Toes.&quot;  The first verse I can relate to:  &quot;The current is strong from what I've heard/it'll whisk you down the stream/but I never seem to have the tune/so my toes just touch the water.&quot;  Lyrically, one of my favourites here.<br />The humility felt by a single mother who's broken down on the road and is forced to call her ex, who's now making something of his life and has another woman, is in the sobering &quot;Humble Me&quot;, which features only a pump organ, a prominent resonator guitar, and bass.  The protagonist's feeling guilty in this song.<br />The feeling of hesitancy in rejoining the world, meeting a special someone is felt in the slow and bluesy &quot;Above Ground&quot; of a woman living underground, with nothing but her thoughts and a ceiling fan above her.  The promise is that &quot;I'll be with you someday&quot;, but when?<br />She does two covers here, Townes Van Zandt's &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; and Tom Waits' &quot;The Long Way Home.&quot;  There's a folky/country feel to it, but the bulk of it Norah accompanied by the bass and the tapping on a box, making it a nice minimalist number.<br />Norah tackles an upbeat folky/bluegrass number, &quot;Creepin' In&quot; which features Dolly Parton as guest vocalist.  There's an interesting double meaning here.  Verse one goes &quot;There's a big hole/that's gone right through the sole.&quot;  Hence the water goes creepin' in.  Well, in the final chorus, instead of going &quot;and once it has begun/won't stop until it's done&quot; it goes &quot;and once you have begun/don't stop until you're done.&quot;  It's almost as if she sang in the repeat of the first verse &quot;that's gone right through my soul&quot; instead of &quot;my sole.&quot;  Clever, that.<br />The last two numbers could belong on Come Away With Me, the daydreamy country/jazz &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; and melodic 40's piano jazz of &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;, which includes portions of Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia.&quot;This is quite a melancholy and reflective piece, of watching falling snow and thinking the title.  One of my favourites here.<br />Topping a masterpiece like Come Away With Me would be next to impossible, but lo and behold, Muthajones has incorporated other styles in her light and mellow jazz inflections.  The wait has been worth it, the music still melodic and wonderful.  Muthajones does it again!This is quite a melancholy and reflective piece, of watching falling snow and thinking the title.  One of my favourites here.<br />Topping a masterpiece like Come Away With Me would be next to impossible, but lo and behold, Muthajones has incorporated other styles in her light and mellow jazz inflections.

B00004XPP0|5.0|Big news came out on 11 February.  The Original Star Wars Trilogy will be released on DVD, finally!  I am surprised it wasn't immediately reflected on the Amazon.com website, but I am sure that the details for this are forthcoming.<br />Based on the EP 1 and 2 DVD's, I trust we can expect some real quality DVD's.  So the Five Stars is a guess right now.  It is supposed to be a four disk set with commentary, and normal DVD extras and also a &quot;most comprehensive feature-length documentary ever produced about the Star Wars saga and never-before-seen footage from the making of all three films&quot;.  I expect superior quality sound and video, like we have come to expect.  But they are older films, so we'll have to wait and see just how good they look on DVD.  And lastly, it should be the Special Edition versions, which came out in the late 90's.<br />Sure, this is a lot of guesses right now, but the timing for a Sep release of the original trilogy lines up nicely with the May 2005 premier of the Episode 3. . .  something to watch for.
B00009TB5G|1.0|New and out of the shrink wrap my DVDs won't play.  I wonder how many people are getting rooked.  For the price they charged you'd think they could at least put working DVDs in those pretty cases!!<br />PS: I have multiple DVD players in perfect condition.  I play hundreds of DVDs (and keep all of them scratch free), when I say they are defective it is because they are.
B000092ZYX|5.0|As a personal lover of the Bends (the greatest album of all time) I was not very fond of the electronic beats which Thief had inherited from Kid A/Amnesiac, but even that couldn't take away from the sheer brilliance of the other tracks, so even with only 8 songs I like listening to on the album, they are amazing enough for a 5 star rating alone, I've even started to like the beats.
B0000027RL|5.0|Have no fear; this isn't another my-favorite-band-is-far-better-than-your-favorite-band ranting. Hey, we're individuals right? I'll leave it at that.<br />When I have this album playing through a good pair of headphones and with my eyes closed, I'm the only person on earth. In fact, I almost have to be alone sometimes when I'm listening to Ten; distractions just can't be tolerated when all I want to do is to immerse myself in Ten's incredible sounds, melodies, nuances. To the disappointment of PJ fans, I must admit that each new Pearl Jam album strays a bit further away from my taste. Vs. is a really great follow-up, but Ten just can't be topped. Like as mentioned in earlier reviews, it has a lot do with being the debut album, and with the whole presentation of the music not being affected by self-conscious. Sometimes the raw beginnings of an eventual great band is their best, or at least most cherished, incarnation for a fan. It's great to back and hear a band before they got all polished up.<br />It's simply an amazing work, from the first track to the last. And I'd have to say that any import version of Ten with extra tracks would only take away from the presentation if playing through the whole CD. \\"Release\\" and \\"Master/Slave\\" wrap it up perfectly, and that's that. In my opinion, I feel that Ten is one of the timeless keystones of American rock music.<br />Aside from the usual standout tracks, my faves are \\"Garden\\" and \\"Release,\\" both brilliant and moving tracks.<br />And an added recommendation if I may; If you want a little repose away from the \\"my-favorite-band\\" grunge war, keep an eye out for a new flavor: a 5-man band in Australia named themselves Powderfinger after Neil Young's song and published a 7-track EP in 1993. Since then, they've become a beloved part of Australia's music scene. They're little known in the USA, having released only one album here as well as a track on the Mission: Impossible soundtrack (versus 5 albums, 3 EP's, and a plethora of great singles/b-sides in Australia). Although they've carved out a niche and sound of their own over the years, and proved to be a very creative and versatile band in the process, in their first album, Parables for Wooden Ears (1994), I can hear cues from Pearl Jam's Ten and sounds that would have been welcome here during the early 90's rock scene. Standout albums are Double Allergic (their 2nd) and Internationalist (3rd). They continue to rock it with a 5th album release in mid-2003. Taste soundclips of all their songs and see their music videos at [...]

He is hands down the best new artist/producer of this year, considerin he's been on the scene for a whil. I've never heard anything like this album before. the beats, each seem to have it's own life, and it's own unique story to tell. the artists he chose to feature, are all icons of their &quot;field&quot;, and they all contribute to an already brilliant offering by the new kid.
B000002J03|5.0|To tell you the truth, this is probably my least-played LZ record, but that is only because all of the songs (aside from the blues workout \\"The Lemon Song\\" and the instrumental \\"Moby Dick\\") remain AOR radio staples 35 years after the original release.  If you have never heard psycho-blues of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" or the riff on \\"Heartbreaker\\", then you must get out from under your rock and get this.
B00005JMCT|4.0|After I got up out of my chair, I was shaking my head and laughing, asking the question, &quot;Where do they come up with this stuff?&quot;  This movie was hands down, the funniest movie of 2003.  When I watched the movie for the 2nd time, I realized I had missed many parts of the movie, due to laughter that carried over into another scene.<br />No mention of Oz, his girlfriend, or Tara Reid's character in the movie, which I found a bit strange.  Other than that, the movie was extremely funny, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.
B000002J0B|5.0|Although I never much thought that &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; was distinctive or that &quot;The Crunge&quot; was particularly memorable, the rest of the songs on this record make it an essential for any AOR catalog.  From the affecting &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot; (the superior sequel to &quot;Ramble On&quot;) to the gothic &quot;No Quarter&quot; to the dreamy &quot;Rain Song&quot; to the rock-pop duo of &quot;Dancing Days&quot; and &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; to the riffology of &quot;The Ocean&quot;, 'Houses of the Holy' definitely has a place in the top half of the all to short LZ catalog.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I'll be honest.  I despised John Mayer when I first heard of him, and saw a video of him.  It was almost like he was trying to clone Dave Matthews, and copy his every move.  Plays his guitar and dances just like him, and his voice is just like him as well.  I love Dave Matthews, so I hated the fact that both Jack Johnson and John Mayer were ripping him off.  Well, not so quick....<br />After I heard more of John Mayer's songs, I was intregued.  \\"Why Georgia\\" is the song that sold me.  What an excellent song.  I checked out his CD and ended up not being able to take it out of my CD player.  Sure, he sounds like Dave Matthews, and obviously, Dave is one of his musical influences.  But John Mayer is a clever lyricist, and puts his songs together very well.  He's got talent, but he's written off as a copycat.  That shouldn't be.<br />People don't know what they're missing here.  Very good music.
B000002J09|5.0|The overall ranking of LZ's eight original studio records among LZ fans will vary depending on the disposition - AOR hit fans will probably like the second album (1969) best, blues fans will probably prefer the first album (1969), prog rockers will most likely express a fondness for 'Houses of the Holy' (1973) or 'Physical Graphiti' (1975), but it can be safely said that this fourth record (1971) is the most concise and complete representation of the band and should be the first record purchased by any new fan.  There is not single dud on this record, which covers the spectrum of hard rock (&quot;Black Dog&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot;), power-blues (&quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;), folk (&quot;Going to California&quot;), epics (&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;), and even those songs that defy classification (&quot;Battle of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Four Sticks&quot;).
B000069AUI|4.0|Hype.  That's the only thing Coldplay has going for them.  Who created the hype?  Their record label, and themselves.  You throw around \\"The last band in the world\\" label long enough, people are going to start to take interest.  They tricked everyone into actually believing they are the greatest band on the planet, and are making incredible, artistic music.  I hate to burst everyones bubble, but Coldplay is a Minor League Radiohead and Pink Floyd cover band.<br />Who could possibly listen to the song \\"The Scientist\\" and not see Pink Floyd written all over it?  Even more so on the title track, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\".  If you're not paying attention, you'd think Pink Floyd released a new CD.  I understand some people would like to believe that Coldplay is a savior of Rock music, but they're a knockoff band.  I see NO original sound in them.<br />Radiohead + Pink Floyd = Coldplay.  YAWN!
B000002JSJ|3.0|In the midst of the rise of Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, etc. in 1976, it is no coincidence that Jimmy Page made this one rock harder than any other.  The problem here is that, with the notable exception of the tightly-executed &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot;, the song-writing is uninspired and, since an injured and grieving Robert Plant was phoning in his performance, the result was not satisfactory.  Many cite &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; as a highlight, but I find that it goes about 4-5 minutes too long.  The same is true of the slow blues attempt, &quot;Tea for One&quot;.  The rest of the record is truly unmemorable, although the original album cover art is one of my favorites of all time (even if it does play off of '2001: A Space Odyssey').  Aside from the postumously released 'Coda' (1982), this should be the last addition to your LZ collection.
B0000AUHRG|5.0|Damnit, this film ROCKS.<br />I got dragged to the cinema to see Equilibrium and when I did it changed my perspective on films.  Its deep, well thought out AND has awesome action to boot.<br />This film is SO much better than The Matrix its unbeleivable.  Now, I like the Matrix (the first... the sequels sucked), but this film blew me away.<br />To anyone who likes either emotional or action films, I seriously recommend this to you.<br />And, just so you know, anyone who says this is a Matrix Rip-Off should be hunted down and shot.<br />Thank you for your time...<br />Now go watch Equilibrium.
B000002J1U|4.0|In the grand scheme of things, Led Zeppelin's third record (1970) was the most dramatic shift the band had ever taken from its previous releases, but was necessary to produce their best record a year later.  It is often referred to as the &quot;acoustic&quot; record, but the fact is that it boasts one of the early &quot;heavy metal&quot; tunes (the single, &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;) two outright rockers (&quot;Celebration&quot;, &quot;Out on the Tiles&quot;), and arguably their best original blues song (&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;).  The other six songs are acoustic, but explore a number of diverse avenues, from pure blues (&quot;Hats Off to (Roy) Harper&quot;) to traditional folk (&quot;Gallow's Pole&quot;) to hand-clapping boogie (&quot;Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp&quot;) to spacey pop (&quot;Tangerine&quot;) to affecting ballads (&quot;That's The Way&quot;).  I highly recommend this LP and 'Physical Graphitti' as a starting point for anyone who wants to get beyond obvious hit records down into the real LZ.
B00018D44U|3.0|Although Nora Jones Voice has matured and is even better than on her last CD, the choice of material is not as strong. If it wasn't for her great voice and the wonderful production, this would be a 1 star for anyone else.
B000002JSP|4.0|As history states, Jimmy Page helmed the band for 'Presence' (1976) and Robert Plant helmed the band for this record (1979), the last true studio album from a legendary band.  Because of the changes made in the sound, and most notably the addition of synths and a different vocal style by Robert Plant, it is hard to judge this record in a vacuum without the benefit of seeing where the band would go next.  That is, as Led Zeppelin III is often judged as a misstep, it was a necessary step to get to the arguably best record, &quot;IV&quot;.  That said, it is undeniably better than its predecessor and has a number of tunes worthy of inclusion as official LZ classics, such as &quot;In the Evening&quot;, &quot;All My Love&quot;, &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot;, and the often overlooked, but elegant blues of &quot;I'm Gonna Crawl&quot;.
0451169514|5.0|IT is a novel that you cannot put down, and I happen to be writing this review at 4:30 in the morning, just after finishing up the last 400 pages. Its that addicting folks, you just cant stop reading this book until you reach the final battle between the Losers and IT, be it may be weird but still making sense with Stephen King's special ability for storytelling. This book revolves around the 7 Losers(They're in the Losers club), and their troubles with the evil on and under Derry. They're all kids who are outcasts at school and have developed a bond because of that. They're constantly haunted by IT, the monster that feeds off the denizens of Derry, Maine, and the murderous Henry Bowers, the local school bully who, by the end of the book, chases the Losers with a switchblade with only one conscious thought: To kill all of them. The Losers eventually gang up on IT and almost destroy IT, but it flees deeper underground, and the Losers vow to return if IT comes back, and IT eventually does, in 1985, and the now grownup Losers fight It to an apocylyptic ending. This story delves into the troubles of adolescence(Bullies, being outcasts)and how to get through their troubles, revenge,evil, friendship, and finally, one of the most recurring elements of IT , Love. Unlike your fellow reviewers, I didn't find this book scary, but I truly loved the story and the way King develops his characters into kids you begin to care for, so its really not necessary to read with other people or whatever, just read with the lights on so you can read a great horror story.
B000002JSN|4.0|Like the fourth record (1971), the double LP 'Physical Graphiti' (1975) was very much a culmination of everything that the band had done before and would do in the future.  &quot;Ten Years Gone&quot; and &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; sounded a lot like something off of . . . well, 'Houses of the Holy' (1972), and &quot;Black Country Woman&quot;, &quot;Boogie with Stu&quot;, and &quot;Down by the Seaside&quot; echoed 'Led Zeppelin III.' On the other side of the coin, the toned-down vocal performance on &quot;Trampled Underfoot&quot; and the ethereal keyboards on &quot;In the Light&quot; would precipitate tunes like &quot;In the Evening&quot; on the last true studio record, 'In Through the Out Door' (1979).  But the real essential here is the epic, &quot;Kashmir&quot;, which plays like a cross between &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Immigrant Song&quot;.  However, there is certainly some filler here, like &quot;The Rover&quot; and &quot;Night Flight&quot;.  For this reason, I would recommend this record only for those who already have the LZ essentials and would like to dig deeper.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|After pushing their progressive/experimental roots are far as they could go on their previous two records SCENES FROM A MEMORY and SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE, Dream Theater finally decided to scale down a little bit and deliver the classic-style heavy metal album they've always wanted to do.  The result is TRAIN OF THOUGHT, a dark, heavy, and punishing 7-song set that never relents from the first song to the last (with the exception of the moving 3-minute interlude &quot;Vacant,&quot; which provides a much needed rest from all the heaviness).  Similar in style and tone to their third album AWAKE, but much more straightforward and less diverse, ToT has its share of flaws, but all around Dream Theater have nearly successfully managed to create the metal juggernaut they wanted to make.<br />Out of the seven songs on here, these are my absolute favorites on the record:<br />&quot;As I Am&quot; (track 1)--What a killer opener!  Despite its 7+ minute running time, this is probably the simplest and most straightforward of all of DT's long songs, but that doesn't make it bad.  Nice defiant lyrics, great catchy chorus, earth-shaking grooves from John Myung and Mike Portnoy, and a scorching guitar solo from Petrucci.  What more could you ask for?<br />&quot;Honor Thy Father&quot; (track 4)--This 10-minute monster is the heaviest and most brutal song on the album.  Mike's lyrics, which are about his intense disdain and hatred towards his stepfather, fit the mood of the music and singer James LaBrie unleashes every vocal arsenal he's capable of delivering, from hushed vocals, to sinister snarls, to soaring Maiden-esque vocals, to even semi-rapped (!) dialogue.  Awesome.  A ripping keyboard solo from Jordan and great riffage from Petrucci round this track out.<br />&quot;Stream of Consciousness&quot; (track 6)--This 11-minute instrumental is my favorite song on the album, and may be one of the most well-crafted and composed pieces I've ever heard, from DT or otherwise.  Thesame melody is repeated throughout, as the band twist and turn it in various directions.  It's amazing how smoothly the song flows.  Lovely guitar and keyboard solos, pitch-perfect drumming from Portnoy, and a downright groovy bass solo section from Myung that would make Tony Levin proud.  Just an amazing piece.<br />&quot;In the Name of God&quot; (track 7)--At 14 minutes, this is the longest on here, and one of the more powerful songs DT has written in quite some time.  This song is about religious hypocrisy and how so-called &quot;leaders&quot; use God and religion to do their evil deeds on society.  By far, this is Petrucci's best lyrical effort since the &quot;Mind Beside Itself&quot; trilogy and &quot;Lines in the Sand,&quot; and the band's musicianship shines best on here (love those Latin rhythms around the 9 minute mark).  James also delivers one of his best vocal performances to date, which says a lot.<br />For the most part, ToT is a solid metal album and it's great to see DT rocking out more than ever before.  However, I can't give it the full 5 stars for a couple of reasons.  For one thing, &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; starts off as a great song with more great vocals from James and heartfelt lyrics from Petrucci, but then it falls apart around the 5 minute mark with a pretentious and overlong instrumental section that doesn't fit the dark vibe of the song AT ALL.  It seems to be just put there for the sake of being there.  When Jordan does that brief cartoon riff in the middle, I was shaking my head in disbelief.  Also, John Petrucci's guitar work, while great in some spots, lacks the diversity and emotion of his earlier work and he just seems to be doing '80s-style shredding just because he can.  The guitar solos for &quot;As I Am&quot; and &quot;SOC&quot; are the only ones I can say that moved me, but not on the other songs unfortunately.<br />Despite those gripes, TOT has a number of things going for it.  This has to be the best-sounding and best-produced album they've ever recorded, and it's great to hear John Myung's bass loud and upfront in the mix for the first time in a long time.  His bass playing is also very inspired and bouncy.  For me, he's the main reason why this album sounds so good.  Just one man's opinion anyway.  As I said earlier, James and Mike have never sounded better as they do here.  Jordan Rudess isn't as prominent like he was on SIX DEGREES, but he does what he can, and his lush piano outro on &quot;In the Name of God&quot; is sublime.<br />I think I've said enough.  While it can't compare the band's holy trinity of IMAGES &amp; WORDS, AWAKE, and SCENES FROM A MEMORY, TRAIN OF THOUGHT shows that Dream Theater are still evolving and doing a damn fine job of it.  As one reviewer said, they put the metal back into progressive metal.
B000002JSR|3.0|Released in 1982, two years after the band disbanded, 'Coda' (1982) has only one truly indispensible track, a 1970 rehearsal version of &quot;I Can't Quit You Babe&quot; (originally from the first record).  Also included is a well-executed cover tune (&quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot;), an unremarkable drum solo (&quot;Bonzo's Montreaux&quot;), an outtake from Led Zeppelin III (&quot;Poor Tom&quot;), an outtake from 'Houses of the Holy' (&quot;Darlene&quot;), and three outtakes from their last record, the most interesting of which is the punkish &quot;Wearing and Tearing&quot;.  Bottom line: this should be the last addition to your collection.
B000002HPT|3.0|Although I've always been a little skeptical about Dream Theater's ability to TKO any other band on the face of the planet within 12 bars of music (a philosophy strictly adhered to by many of their loyal fans), never did I expect the champs of progressive metal to arrive in the latter half of 1997 with this much fat around their waste. To be fair, I'll say up front that there's some truly stellar material on this album. The problem is that the bulk of Dream Theater's bloated new epic is just plain tired- not only are old innovations now cliches, but there is just such little effort put into three quarters of the songwriting on &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot; that even die-hard fans should be disappointed. <br />To avoid having this review sound like one big downward spiral, I'll start with FII's strong points. The good news is that a few more classics are added to the Dream Theater canon in &quot;New Millenium&quot; and &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot;. Many may protest the inclusion of the latter, but I feel it's one of the few times the band have achieved a somber emotional vibe without lapsing into syrupy melodrama. Of all the influences John Petrucci attempts to absorb into his repertoire, the Satch-like riffs on &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; (among others) are one of the few that don't sound contrived. Other obvious influences that sound little more than derivative are Queen, Styx, Pink Floyd and even Dream Theater themselves (&quot;Burning My Soul&quot; is a total rewrite of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot;). Overall the shorter songs are far more provocative and consistent than the longer titles, a trend which seems at odds with the epic virtuosity the band are famed for. At first glance, seeing &quot;Lines In The Sand&quot; (12 minutes) and Trial Of Tears (13 minutes- a three part suite) on the back cover will be enough to interest fans of &quot;Metropolis&quot; and &quot;A Change Of Seasons&quot;. What a disappointment, then, to find that these two songs are possibly theleast progressive on the entire album. It seems the band was going for a middle ground between the instrumental sensationalism of their earlier epics and the dead serious emotion of their ballads (which, if you ask me, more often than not have come off as too petulant with a serious lack of irony). There was nothing wrong with this approach, until they decided to use it on their showcase pieces. The simple fact is that Dream Theater lacks the emotional maturity to manipulate the listener's mood over even as large a spectrum as an entire album, let alone a 13 minute song. This emotional immaturity can easily be gleaned by a quick glance through FII's lyric sheet. Most if not all of the songs seem as though they were written from a template; there are a wealth of unimaginative mixed metaphors (&quot;faith don't pay the rent that's overdue&quot;), overfamiliar symbolism (&quot;swept away with the tide/ through the holes in my hands&quot;), primitive rhyme schemes (&quot;it's alright/ it's OK/ it happens every single day&quot;), and just plain nonsense (&quot;where midnight hysteria's no big surprise&quot;). Every line in every song is but a mere shadow of an idea- an aping of genius passed down through hundreds of generations of declining talent. <br />Many have noted the slightly muffled drums which appear courtesy of new producer Kevin Shirley, but the rest of the instrumentation sounds fine, and the band have only themselves to blame for failing to come up with more than an EP's worth of good material. It's obvious musicianship is Dream Theater's strong suit. It's just a shame the band don't realize it. Instead, they saddle themselves with pretensions they can't hope to fulfill, in the process reducing the songwriting to a virtual catalog of '70s hard rock cliches. I read an interview in which James LaBrie is quoted as saying they plan on being a band that sells a guaranteed two million records with each release (Rush is the apparent benchmark for this figure). That could explain the mass production feel of &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot;, but it doesn't excuse it.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Do yo thang kanye. He straight up kilt it, meng.  Hottest beats, hott lyrics, funny ass skits!  Favorite song: Kanye's Workout Plan!  Go cop this album right now!
B00006IU73|5.0|This is the first Porcupine Tree I bought. I actually saw them live too. In Absentia is a pretty good progressive rock album that can be compared as a blend between Pink Floyd and The Cure. Sounds pretty good huh? But dont mistake it as only being that. The transitions in the songs are done really well. The crisp and gentle sound of the acoustic guitar along with some really ambeint keyboards is a real treat to listen to. Stephen Wilson's gentle voice and soothing lead guitar is an added plus. I wish this band was bigger than the crap MTV and VH1 feeds us.     Highlight in this album: Trains
B000002H6C|5.0|maybe a lot of you weren't around when this thing came out but it brings back memories of junior high with every metalhead wearing &quot;and justice for all&quot; t-shirts like it was their religion. it was a record a ton of metalheads identified with yet at the same time had personal effects on probably millions of metal geeks while they were trying to copy pushead drawings in their room thinking how much their parents/school sucked.<br />the production is perfect for a thrash metal record. its just very dark and isolated and captures a real &quot;black&quot; feeling when listening to it. sure, everyone complains about the lack of bass guitar in the mix but seriously - the guitar production/tracking is unrivaled to ANY record to date except maybe Pantera's &quot;vulgar display of power&quot; in the thrash genre... every track whops your speakers. every melodic breakdown is like some epic war song with layers upon layers.<br />the lyrics were metallica's best ever and held some soul to them. in total, youll never see a record like this again in many aspects. in musicianship, in production and holding such timelessness for such an aggressive record.<br />dont kid yourself, all of metallica's stuff predating this is all awesome in its own individual way as they matured the sound. this just happens to be the pinnacle of the art - capturing a time when metallica was technically beautiful and well thought out.
B0001AP12G|4.0|The CD College Dropout was straight the beats were on point but some of the tracks were wack. Kayne got this crazy ass style its probably why he is a college droput but overall the cd was hot for a new artist Good collaberations with Jay-z, Freeway, Ludacris, Tweli, and Common. Just Copp the CD to hear this cats style.
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is like no other book I have read. Its been beautifully crafted by an amazing author name Dan Brown. Dan Brown really grabbed my attention by showing how well researched his book is. He has stunned me by showing how well he can develop characters, so many twists, and so much action in the course of a day. The Da Vinci Code boldly marches into the grounds of religious symbology, secret brotherhoods, and science only to mesmerize the reader with information and mind-blowing code.
B00006879E|5.0|There is not a bad song on this CD.  What a fantastic, amazing debut albumn for Maroon 5.  I bought this CD based on hearing &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; on the radio.  I was a little hesitant, because sometimes great singles don't always translate into great CD's.  This was definitely the case with Maroon 5.  This is a fabulous CD and I cannot say enough about it.  It has literally not left my CD player for weeks.  Maroon 5 has a totally new sound which is remniscent of Stevie Wonder and Jamiroquai (but w/ better songs than Jamiroquai!).  Their songwriting talent is similar to Better Than Ezra ... varied and interesting and with a little something for everyone.  Each song is great, catchy, and you will find yourself singing along in no time.  I highly recommend this CD for those of you who enjoy kind of jazz-y, alternative, rock tunes.  Great music, great voices.  It is simply an incredible CD.  I think Maroon 5 will be next year's Best New Artist at the Grammy's!
B000001GPW|5.0|This is one of those legendary re-releases from the golden halls of Deutsche Grammophon-dom that is sure to make you shiver with amazement.  The sound-job here is incredible.  I simply couldn't believe that this stuff was done in 1960.  There's not even the tiniest TRACE of hiss here.  I've heard recordings from 2003 that impressed me less than this.<br />Bartók's three phenomenal piano concertos metamorphose into magnficent and debilitatingly mind-blowing putty in the hands of Ferenc Fricsay and Géza Anda.  Bartók's compatriots were probably more influential than anybody else in preserving and in some cases establishing his reputation after his death, above all in the German-speaking countries, which had been intellectually zapped after World War II.  These DG recordings from 1960 and 1961 are explosive testimony to Fricsay and Anda's brilliance.  Bartók's concertos pound and pulsate with orchestal thump and shimmer with pianistic glitter like you just wouldn't believe.<br />Mind-expanding music, coupled with a totally revelatory recording.  Miss it and die!
B00003CWPR|4.0|an intensely thought-provoking, moody film that delves into bizarre and interesting territory. Loneliness, fear and lust are a few of the themes captured majestically within a stunning visual landscape and hypnotic dream-like sequences that spirit your mind into vast spaces.<br />Quite enjoyable.
B00003CXV4|1.0|Charlize tries to be a sweet girl but actually she is annoying in the movie, harassing peoples like that and convincing that she wants to help, playing a Polyanna role. Please! Keanu doesn't seems that terrible, actually I found him so normal, he got a life, she doesn't and try to convince him that he is abnormal. Besides, she dress like a homeless, those gloves, scarfs, really vulgar. What peoples saw in her to even consider her sexy? She is plain skinny, no curves. In the movie she sounds as annoying as the leading lady in Legally Blondie 2.
0553801511|5.0|Fantastic book!! Robin Hobb has quickly become my favorite author. With so much fluff on the market today this is a welcome relief. I have read all her books. The mad ship series were my least favourite but all of them fascinating... i'm counting the days until my copy of 'fool's fate arrives'
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is definatly one of the best yet of 2004 and i think it might be one of the only. Very few artists are afraid to express themeselves and who they are but Kanye West isnt. He is one of the most soulful and sought after producers. As a rapper he can drop lyrical bombs just as good as any of the other lyricst. I recommend this album to everybody. Some of the best songs on the album are &quot;Last Call&quot; &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; and &quot;Two words&quot; to name of few. The whole album is genious and flawless. GO GET IT KNOW ITS HOT!!!
0676974562|5.0|I feel all has been said and I'm repeating the earlier reviews but I have to write because I so enjoyed this book.  The first few chapters were a bit long, a lot of descriptions.  <br />Once it picks up, the story is incredible.  This author can write about is characters in a way that is almost impossible to describe.  You get in the heads of the people and there is no going back.  Not only is the plot interesting, hte narrative itself is enough to sustain the book.  And, unlike most novels I've read lately, I was SO happy with the ending.  I won't say more so I won't spoil it for other readers.  <br />This was the first novel of this author I've read.  I'm going to read all his books.<br />READ this!
630463949X|5.0|A must see for any classic rock fan!!! I find myself watching this DVD at least once a week, I never get tired of it. The interaction between the performers, who after many years and all of their trials and tribulations, is still passionate and touching today.
B0000508U6|5.0|&quot;Sparks&quot;, &quot;Yellow&quot;, &quot;Trouble&quot;,..... the list goes on, excellent production, craftsmanship, playing, singing! The band is so innovative that they are constantly compared to the OTHER great innovative British alt-rock band, Radiohead. I happen to love them too, but they are so different in so many ways. True originals who will stand the test of time.
B0001AP12G|1.0|I looked at the other reviews and thought this album might be something, I was dead wrong.  I like his beats but the rap needs lots of work. The songs on this album are all trash with the exception of &quot;Slow Jams&quot; which you could probably download.  I would recomend that you buy Twista's Kamikaze instead.  There's way more GOOD songs on that album.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah has the ability to sing poignantly without sounding ambitious or like she's trying too hard. The beauty is in the phrasing, the simplicity and the lovely tone of her voice. Her piano playing is the perfect accompaniment, equally spare but enthralling. &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; is just one of the unforgettable moments on this classic album. I'm a fan for life!
B000084T18|2.0|Let me get this out of the way, &quot;In da club&quot; is one of the best club songs of all time.Whew! Now,this album is filled with such crap it makes me sick. The only other good tracks are &quot;Many men&quot;, &quot;Backdown&quot;, and &quot;Wangsta&quot;. The rest of the tracks are just repeated attemps to get a single. Real &quot;thugs&quot; don't name drop, brag or boast about the things they needed to do to survive. 50 is the platinum plus performance thug he so desperatley tries to critisize. Burn it, copy it from a friend or just turn on the radio; but do yourself a favor and don't waste your money.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|She is such a brilliant artist, but even they have off moments from time to time and I guess this is it for Erykah. I appreciated the experiment on first listening, but I didn't particularly want to hear it again. Stand out track is &quot;Back in the Day&quot;.
0064400018|5.0|Life is hard living on the frontier of Wisconsin in the 1870's.  Laura is only a little girl, but she still needs to help with chorus around her family's log cabin.  There are wild animals in the woods, and they must provide for themselves since the nearest town in hours away.  But it's not all hard work.  If Pa's not tired, he might entertain his daughters with a story or by playing his fiddle.  With family relatively nearby to visit, life is certainly never dull.<br />I had not read these books since I was a child until picking this up to reread.  I had forgotten how entertaining they really are.  There is no real plot, just a collection of stories covering a year in the life of the Ingalls family.  This makes sense since they really are an autobiographical work.  Still, the simple charm of the stories sucked me right in and I had a hard time putting the book down.  There is plenty of detail here to give anyone a good picture of daily life during this time.  And I must mention the illustrations by Garth Williams that greatly add to the book.<br />There's a reason these books are so well loved 70 years after they were written.  They are an entertaining look at everyday life in a different time and place.  This is a book to treasure.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay are truly one of the most innovative bands around. They have incredible songwriting chops, as was evidenced by the Grammy for &quot;Clocks&quot; Best record, very well deserved. Chris Martin's voice is a thing of beauty, so versatile and surprising. &quot;Amsterdam&quot; and &quot;God put a smile..&quot; are also favorites. I didn't think they could improve on the first album, but I was wrong. This is a wonderful album.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is movie that you'll either rate high or low with little middle ground. I had high expectations, but at the end, I felt I had gone nowhere interesting or enlightening or been entertained. I don't see any Academy Award material here. My .02 cents worth.
B00005OAIE|5.0|What a great talent, his lyrics are fascinating, what a great storyteller. His guitar work reminds me of some of the funky stuff the George Benson put out back in the early 80's. My jams are &quot;Body is a Wonderland&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot; to name a few. He'll be around for a while!
0446677450|5.0|I know a lot of people who refuse to change with the financial environment. They are always talking about how they work so hard and such and such barely works and make tons of money. It is becuase they are stuck in the 50's concept of breaking your back and living month to month. It is the middle class trap. Then there are the psuedo intellects who say that money is the root of all evil, yet they are depressed, paralyzed by their lack of income and cynical of those that make decent money. My dad is the outside the box thinker when it comes to money and has instilled the risk needed in becoming wealthy. I work a job I am passionate about and then my business is making investments and money. People think that objects will buy happiness...which is so wrong. If I have this shirt my life will be so great, if I have this car things will really come together. That is true inslavement, going out and getting creative is freedom. I am only in my mid twenties, and I have used this method to make investments from a young age. This has allowed my to travel the world and go after my dreams. Don't let your ego paralyze you...ask for advice, talk to people that have money. Check out this book and shift your way of thinking to one of risk and financial freedom. At that pointmoney won't control you, you will control it.
B00009P1O0|5.0|I am thankful for this record. It has saved my life many times over when in the throes of black, adolescent despair. It was definitely one of the records I listened to most in the 1979/1980 period. Together with the triple record \\"Decade\\" this record was my revelation if not a salvation when music fought against the suicidal brooding.<br />This is also incredibly even record, all tracks shine with, possibly the exception of the high pitched, (too) intense \\"Revolution Blues\\".<br />For hours I shall listen, entranced, to my favorites here - the astonishing \\"Ambulance Blues\\", the lovely \\"See The Sky\\", the jocular \\"Vampire Blues\\", \\"Motion Pictures\\"-----<br />If I were stranded on a desert island I'd must have this CD in my straw hut collection.
B0000D96NX|5.0|There are no words to describe this cd.  This is defintaly the best cd that I have ever bought.  Well worth the money and the wait.  Just buy it, you know you want it!!!!!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Most of the reviews on here are from NON-musicians.  So, to those, John Mayer may sound a bit like Dave Mathews (who I can't stand).  Dave Mathews seems to whine when he sings.  John Mayer has a blues/Jazz influence that has to be seen live to be greatly appreciated.  I base a CD or a musician on how difficult it is to learn.  Dave Mathews takes me about 10 mins per song to learn.  For lyrics, just mumble and whine and get about 1/3 of them correct and nobody will know.  John Mayer's stuff isn't that easy.  He uses some pretty complex chords and has lyrics that Dave would kill for.  On top of that, he doesn't sound boy-band (thank God).  From his early demos to his current CD, he matures and changes and all of the music is quality.<br />CD was bought on a whim for No Such Thing.  Favorite song is 3x5.  Lyrics are unbelievable.
0312263120|1.0|Mind numbingly banal.  I am not a mystery buff or a thriller buff at all but I figured out the plot developments  pages & pages before any of the \\"brilliant\\" characters in the book. More boring than waiting in queue at the DMV.    Since this book is about Math, lets \\"run some numbers\\" on this book.  There are 384 pages in the paperback and 128 CHAPTERS!  This is an average of 3 pages per chapter.  Many chapters are less than 2 pages and quite a few not even a single page long. I'd guess that none are over 5 or 6 pages.Not much chance for plot or character development.    Instead of a deliberate, well-researched development of plot you get a staccato splattering of scenes bouncing back and forth between 2 primary story lines.  Sometimes, Brown breaks what should be a single 10 page chapter into 2 or 3 chapters for no apparant reason or effect--it almost feels like a COMMERCIAL should appear between some of the chapters..    What is glaringly obvious is that this author watched ENTIRELY TOO MUCH TV when he was young.  I find it amazing that he is allowed a venue to spew this drivel forth just because he can string some sentences together and print a nifty code at the end.    By the way, the code at the end? A simple Cesarean cube just as illustrated in the last few chapters. Notice that the numbers are no higher than 128--the number of chapters in the book.  Put the numbers in the cube, substitute the 1st letter from the corresponding chapter and you get--WE ARE WATCHING YOU.    Oooooooeeeewwweee, how neato! I must rush out and buy all the rest of his books!    Not.
1402541805|1.0|Call me simple, but I couldn't get through the first tape of the unabridged audio book.  I tried to be patient, but after an hour, the plot still hadn't begun to take shape. Although I can't offer much in the way of a review, I nonetheless felt the need to post one, because I bought this book BECAUSE of the rave reviews.  It may warm up, but all indications pointed to ramblings of cultures and complications in simple lives, and I was absolutely bored to death.  The slow speech and accent of the reader may have contributed to the coma this book attempted to put me in.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I have never heard of this musical before. I saw the CD at a music shop but I was reluctant to but it at first because I wasn't sure if it was that good.  After listing to some samples on the net, I thought they were good so I ordered one.  Wicked is wickedly good and I have not stop listening to it since I got it in the mail.  the music is sweet and the lyrics have a lot of emotion.  I am definitely planning to see the real live musical this spring.
0385504209|3.0|With all of the hype about this book I was drawn to see for myself.  It is a good muder-mystery book and the author does point out some interesting aspects of famous icons.  The story moves very fast which keeps your interest.  I found however that there was too many &quot;leaps of faith&quot; in some of the links suggested and some answers were so obvious that the character's failure to spot it must be an obvious device to draw out the story a little more.<br />A thoroughly enjoyable book but just a wee bit too slick in parts.
B00003CXCT|1.0|The revisions Lucas made to the original Star Wars trilogy for the Special Editions remain cheezy and degrading. There is no question that these changes will appear just as corny in DVD format as they did in VHS not to mention on the big screen. <BR>From Greedo's lack of point blank marksmanship to Luke's suicide Tarzan yell as he plummets down the shaft of Cloud City, these revisions effortlessly turn Sci Fi classics into student film comedies.<BR>I find it infuriating that Lucas has refused to listen to the outcry from Star Wars fans for the past 5 years to include the original versions on the DVD. Where would these films be without the people who paid cash to go see them 20 times back in the 70's and 80's? <BR>Keep your S.E. version, George. I'm not buying. Just know that to many Star Wars fans, the \\"S\\" does not refer to the word \\"Special\\".
B00018D44U|5.0|When I first heard &quot;Come Away with Me,&quot; I was impressed with Jones' vocal style and phrasing.  Its soft-scratchiness and lush tone reminded me a lot of Billie Holiday (Even though she's been compared to Dusty Springfield).  That comparison is even more apparent on &quot;Feels Like Home.&quot; She's relaxed and in control, sounding more confident and comfortable.  With catchy tunes like, &quot;Sunrise,&quot; &quot;Those Sweet Words,&quot; and my personal favorite, &quot;The Prettiest Thing,&quot;  Jones' dares to be subtle and understated.  Some may interpret that as an sign that she lacks the vocal capabilities of other performers in her age group. I think that what she may &quot;lack&quot; in hystrionics and repetitive trills, she more that compensates for in her sensitivity and approach to the lyrics. <br />I highly recommend this CD.
B000089RVX|2.0|I don't think so. I can't believe people actually listen to this and say &quot;Yeah this stuff is hard as hell.&quot; This stuff is so far from being hard or real metal it's not even funny. I'll give the chick credit though. She has a good voice, and is a very good singer, that's why I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1, but people, this stuff is not metal. If you think you're a metal head by listening to this type of music you're sadly mistaken. If you want to hear some real metal that makes this band sound as soft as the Spice Girls listen to Slayer, Kreator, Cradle of Filth, or old Metallica. That is what metal is.
B00003W8NM|3.0|Saw this movie last month.  Everyone ranted and raved about this movie (which I avoided seeing for a long time) and while I admit it has great acting and directing, and is very stylish, I was left holding an empty bag at the end of the film.  I won't spoil the &quot;surprise&quot; ending, but I will say I thought the wrap-up did nothing for me.<br />Maybe I'm from the wrong generation?  But I was 24 in 1999 and I doubt even then I could have gotten into the &quot;message&quot; that this movie seems to deliver.  On the one hand, the message seems to be that we ought to abandon the conventional and live our lives as if every day will be our last.  Sort of a &quot;go for the gusto&quot; premise.  On the other hand the message seems to be that your modern young American male is condemned to a life utterly devoid of thumos, hence his only way to attain bona fide manhood is through senseless brutality?  I dunno, but speaking as a new father, husband of ten years, an Army Reservist, full-time employee, full time student, et al, there are more than enough &quot;dragons&quot; in this world to slay without having to engage in any of the nasty business portrayed in the film.<br />The world is ripe with challenge, and any young male with half a brain ought to be able to find a hundred different things to engage himself in that will not only prove positively productive, but also extremely &quot;manly&quot; in every sense of the term.  Pitt's character whines that his generation has no great wars to fight?  Well, 9/11 knocked on our door, and it seems we have a doozy of a war on our hands now.  Pitt declares that you cannot plumb the true depth of your manhood without fighting?  In an age when young males are neck-deep in senseless slaughter, I would argue that unless the fighting is actually for something important (e.g. the real War that is on right at this very moment) the senseless barbarity of the 'fight club' is the furthest thing from manly virtue.<br />Really, that's what I'm left with after watching this film.  Twist ending aside, what point was there to the 'fight club' anyway?  Yes, the film does seem to be something of a rant against our consumerist American culture, but we must remind ourselves that previous generations of young men worked hard and died hard so that we in this age could know comfort, safety, immense material well being, and few real hardships.  If this comfy life is a 'bad' thing that we men supposedly chaffe against, then it is news to me.  And for any young man out there who is looking for challenges and contests beyond the ordinary, I would refer him to his local Army, Navy, Marine, or Air Force recruiter.  The Service has a bottomless list of opportunities for young men to prove themselves, often in the manliest and most noble way possible, and it's all just a phone call away.<br />Okay, enough with the commercial.  I just shook my head at the end of this movie and thought to myself, what was the point??I'm left with after watching this film.  Twist ending aside, what point was there to the 'fight club' anyway?

B00008OLIC|5.0|&quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot; belongs in the same category as AC/DC's &quot;Back in Black&quot; and Def Leppard's &quot;Hysteria.&quot;  It's commercially appealing, yet tough enough and unique enough to stand out as a real gem in the metal/hair band genre.  Motley Crue was at its best on this album.  Every song here is excellent.  The title track is clearly one of the best metal songs made to date.  &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot; growls its way through your ear canal and rips your heart apart as the Crue pounds out this tune.  &quot;Without You&quot; is also solid.<br />The Crue danced that fine line of not being too glam and not being too pop with just the right amount of excessive metal injected in to the music.  This is a commercial masterpiece.  Everyone has heard something off of this album.<br />A funny thing about this album is that it is the first album the Crue did after they sobered up.  That tells you something right there:  commercial success/genre cred is a result of cleaning up your act.  Aerosmith did the same thing.<br />Give it to the Crue, this album is above and beyond the rest of their offerings.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ok many have tried and many have failed. Trying to be a top notch producer and rapper at the same time was impossible but here comes Kanye West. This album is truely amazing from the subject matter to the beats. My favorites are We Dont Care, Last Call, Kanye Workout Plan,Jesus Walks and of course Slow Jamz. Basically, this is a Huge contender for Hip Hop Album of the Year. I cant wait for Late Registration,Graduation and Good Ass JOb, his next albums..Great Job Kanye!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|The best Hip-Hop album I've heard in the last few years. Hip-Hop in my opninon has been heading in the wrong direction for quite some time. With the exception of Talib Kweli, Common, Outkast, and a few others, the game just isnt the same. And then comes along this brilliant work by Kanye West. I was very excited about this project but wasnt expecting anything like this. It put a smile on my face and me made rememder the good old days of hip hop. For anyone familiar with the Chicago Hip Hop scene, you can defintely feel the No I.D.(Kanye Mentions No I.D. as his mentor on Last Call) production influence. Kanye has just taken that sound to a whole new level. And don't sleep on Kanye's lyrics. He is a much more polished MC that I ever thought he would be. Thanks Kanye for letting everyone know Hip Hop still has the creativity that true hip hop fans came to expect over the years.
B00006AW2M|5.0|I read one review saying that the Stones were trying to cash in on the psychadelic craze.  This is not true, the Stones were probably doing more LSD than most bands out there.  This album is pure LSD-influenced psycadelia.  I don't compare this album to anything the Beatle's did either.  The guitar sounds more influenced by Syd Barrett, especially on the reprise to Sing This All Together.  I do have to say that though, it doesn't sound like they are really trying to copy anyone or anything, just doing music that they thought sounded cool while tripping and they wanted the world to hear it.  I think Mick Jagger was quoted with saying &quot;We took too much acid while recording that.&quot; I don't know how accurate that quote is but he did say something similar about taking too much acid.  When bands take alot of acid, you get a psychadelic album, look at Pink Floyd's Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Jimi Hendrix's Electric Lady Land, Bob Dylan's Blonde on Blonde, and Syd Barrett's solo albums.  I think Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts club band was somewhat psychadelic but it was a pop-psychadelic, something made to bring the psychadelia to the mainstream, and make that kind of music more accessible.  This stones album is far from easily accessible though.  The more you listen to it, the more you appreciate it.  I for one wish that the Stones did more psychadelic stuff, but we are still left with a great catalog from a great band.  You can't hate on one album because it was completely different than anything else they did.  One of the most underappreciated albums of all time, and one of my favorites.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I must admit, it took me approximately 20 minutes to actually get into this movie. I so wanted to shut if off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and decided to give it more time. I am extremely happy that I did.<br />While this is not a 'masterpiece' as 'Moulin Rouge', it is definately VERY good. The acting was stupendous. The actors made me feel that the story was very real. In a very 'slight' way, I was reminicant of 'Dirty Dancing'.<br />Scott is this Awesome ballroom dancer who does not adhere to 'Strictly Ballroom' rules. He loses a major competition due to his unorthodox dance moves. His overly dramatic dance partner dumps him right before another major competition, and poor Scott is left partnerless. In appears an extremely 'ugly duckling' who wants to dance with him. What happens next is ..... well, I guess you should watch it to know the rest.<br />Overall this was a delightfully lighthearted movie with some poignant scenes that will leave you teary eyed. I recommend it wholeheartedly.
B000002TYK|5.0|In my opinion this is the Foo's best cd.  Just pure raw energy and agression.  Some of the lyrics are a little silly or have little or no meaning, but the musick more than makes up for it.  Just pure energy and rawness.  Dave Grohl played most of the instruments on here because there really wasn't a band yet.  Thats why this cd is so good because Dave is a great Musician.  If you like your musick, raw, fast, with lots of energy definitley check this out.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I loved Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back and liked Return of the Jedi when they were in theaters from 1977-84. But George Lucas committed an unforgivable sin when he re-edited the movies for the \\"Special Editions\\": the complete altering/butchering of the previously excellent but now terrible Greedo scene. There are also other annoying changes I can't quite remember, along with some positive changes to the backgrounds and special effects. But it's the awful Greedo scene change that stays with me - it completely ruined the movie and soured me on Star Wars for good. Apparently the original versions - the ones that made Mr. Lucas his fame and fortune, the ones that were loved by all  - are not going to be released on DVD. Steven Spielberg knew better with E.T. and released both versions; but then Spielberg is a classy and honorable man, unlike his pal Lucas. Lucas is truly insulting his audience (or what is left of it after 2 mind-numbingly awful sequels) and he does not deserve a penny of your hard earned money unless he releases the original movies either alone or in a set with the Special Editions. Please do not let your love of Star Wars blind you from protesting his revisionist butchery. BOYCOTT THE STAR WARS DVDS!
B000067CPX|5.0|This is a great CD overall. It has a lot of songs that will become some of your favorites quickly. Definetely a Five Star album. However, I think that it is more of a 4.5. Why? It just doesn't quite live up to Californication, but that's what happens with great albums.
B00009W0U4|4.0|perhaps one of the most shocking films i've seen in the past year or so, i'm having a difficult time placing a star rating on this review but let me give you some facts if nothing else. for starters, monica belluci is one of the most beautiful in the actress in the business & i hated watching her gruesome rape scene(even though this isn't the most graphic scene in the film) this montage alone was perhaps the most scary rape scene since baise moi or i spit on your grave. having said this, i can respect the artistry of the film & the terrific performances but i couldn't bring myself to watch it more than once. gaspar noe has a style here similiar to nolan's memento(although a little less confusing i believe) which is cool but certain scenes here tend to drag including the senseless acts of hatred & violence. irreversible opens up with a naked old man sitting on a bed telling us how time manages to literally destroy everything & we should already be forewarned that nothing good could possibly happen throughout the course of 90 odd minutes. he then tells a younger gentleman how his young daughter was taken away from him after he sexually molested her. yuck! in the next scene, we see two young men searching all over an s&m gay club to find some man & we have no understanding as to the urgency of finding this mysterious character. needless to say, you learn more information about each character or event with each montage. in essence, each montage shows us more detail as to what has transpired & what will lead up to the violent chain of events which are shown in the second scene. i should make a point that watching a man's arm broken by another man & then seeing a man's face literally crushed is a bit excessive for an artsy film so this may disturb many viewers. as i stated earlier, the rape scene isn't the only harrowing or intense scene in irreversible. there isn't really a whole lot i can gather from this film except that the terrible things we do to one another often are permanent & humans by nature are barbaric in ways we can't possibly imagine. definately not a feel good film by any means & most viewers will perhaps be subject to much nausea after watching but i still tend to believe irreversible will have a grand cult following for some strange reason. i give it 4 stars out of a possible 5 for great acting, nausea inducing camera-work, & a decent film-making style. the dialogue is an honorable mention but most people will probably only view this film for one obvious reason. they will want to see if this film is as shocking & truly repulsive as so many have stated before me. if you loved memento or baise moi, probability suggests you will probably want to see this one too. it's hard to believe though that you can actually purchase this in a store like best buy. wait a second, best buy also sold a faces of death box set so i'm not too surprised after all.re permanent & humans by nature are barbaric in ways we can't possibly imagine. definately not a feel good film by any means & most viewers will perhaps be subject to much nausea after watching but i still tend to believe irreversible will have a grand cult following for some strange reason. i give it 4 stars out of a possible 5 for great acting, nausea inducing camera-work, & a decent film-making style. the dialogue is an honorable mention but most people will probably only view this film for one obvious reason. they will want to see if this film is as shocking & truly repulsive as so many have stated before me. if you loved memento or baise moi, probability suggests you will probably want to see this one too. it's hard to believe though that you can actually purchase this in a store like best buy. wait a second, best buy also sold a faces of death box set so i'm not too surprised after all.
