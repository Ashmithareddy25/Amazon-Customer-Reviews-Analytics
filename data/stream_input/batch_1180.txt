B0012HCASA|5.0|I really liked this series, I hate that they ended it.  The story was really starting to develop near the end.  Also, the production quality was top notch.  Highly recommend, just be prepared to be left hanging.
B0034G4P8K|3.0|I went to see this one earlier in the week with a buddy of mine.  After finally getting caught up with some of the writing, I took a couple days to see Keith Birdsong and hung out in Muskogee, Oklahoma.  It was his birthday and he wanted to go see Transformers 3.  I have to admit that I wasn't looking forward to seeing the movie.  The second movie was too long, too loud, and too confusing.  I didn't enjoy it at all.<br /><br />Sadly, this movie hit me the same way.  Some of the graphics were really awesome, some of the gags were incredibly funny, and I really enjoyed hearing Leonard Nimoy as a character.  I still maintain that Shia LeBeouf is an immensely watchable star and will be a remarkable leading man in a few more years.<br /><br />Despite LeBeouf's acting, there's just not much of a story for him to work with.  His role throughout this film kept getting minimized and maximized, and I was never really sure if he was going to matter during the resolution.  As it turned out, not much.<br /><br />John Tuturro won my heart with several lines and with his scenery-chewing acting.  He didn't mind going over the top with his character or making fun of it at the same time.  I think I'd love to see a movie that focuses on this character tracking down some government conspiracy.  It would be a lot of fun.<br /><br />One of the things that really bothered me about this movie as well was a separation between Witwicki (LeBeouf) and Bumblebee.  I think they should have been together more.  That relationship was one of the things that really work for me in the first movie, which I did enjoy.<br /><br />The graphic designs and effects were absolutely amazing though.  I loved seeing all the computer graphic action on the screen, as well as how the Transformers changed shape throughout.<br /><br />So much of the story seemed to be add-ons.  Witwicky's scenes with his parents, the whole episode with John Malkovich, and even the subplot with the romantic triangle could have been dropped.  However, that would have left Witwicky off the screen.  They should have just made him part of the team and involved with the situation from the beginning.  That lay there wouldn't have been so much time lost looping in all of these other elements so that Witwicky would have had the screen time he did.<br /><br />A quick look at the box office indicates that this film scored another high success in movie dollars, even though it didn't score so high with moviegoers.  I would suspect there will be a Transformers 4 coming.e left Witwicky off the screen.  They should have just made him part of the team and involved with the situation from the beginning.

B000G7PNAE|5.0|This is an awesome album by Classic Rockers, Journey in 1981. I'll say that this is their 2nd best or 3rd best (Best being Infinity and this is their 2nd or 3rd best depending on how much I like Frontiers.) But this does include some of their all-time best songs: \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", \\"Escape\\", \\"Mother, Father\\", & \\"Open Arms\\". Steve Perry sounds amazing just like any other album, Jonathan Cain makes his Debut in Journey here (Ok he was with the Babys but what I mean is this is his 1st album with Journey), Neal Schon rocks as always, Ross Valory gives us a solid performance, Steve Smith (Best Drummer ever!) is completely awesome here!    Now let's take a look at this music:    1. \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\"- I won't describe this because I've never met a person who's never heard this before! (Yes it's that popular! This puts all modern music to shame.)    2. \\"Stone in Love\\"- Great tune. I like the opening guitar part and the song that follows said opening.    3. \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\"- Mellow but powerful rocker. GREAT guitar solo. This solo really showcases Schon's talent as a guitarist.    4. \\"Keep on Runnin\\"- A fun little song that is fast and catchy. I like it a lot.    5. \\"Still They Ride\\"- A beautiful ballad that showcases Perry's amazing voice.    6. \\"Escape\\"- Best song on the album. As a fan of progressive music, this is amazing. I love the instrumental section between the 2 different parts. And the guitar on the 2nd part is just plain awesome!    7. \\"Lay it Down\\"- None of the songs of this album are bad by any means but I don't like this one and the next one as much as the rest. It's just a rocker.    8. \\"Dead or Alive\\"- A good song but not too interesting to me. It has a good beat and guitar part but I just don't care for it.    9. \\"Mother, Father\\"- A very nicely done Power Ballad about the strength of the family. I love the whole song and I think it's one of their overall best.    10. \\"Open Arms\\"- Their biggest hit of the album. It reached number 2 back in the year it came out. I like this ballad but \\"Faithfully\\" from Frontiers is better IMO.    Bonus Tracks:    11. \\"La Roza del Sol\\"- This is a lame excuse for a bonus track. It's okish but I don't like it. It's like a dance song but it just sounds weird for them.    Tracks 12-14- Live versions of \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" (I like the live version of this one better), \\"Who's Cryin' Now\\", and \\"Open Arms\\".    Verdict: This is a Classic Rock Classic. This was their biggest selling album (until they released their Greatest Hits) and for good reason. It's mainstream 80's and very awesome. This reissue is just awesome. If you like bands like Boston, REO Speedwagon, or Survivor, then this will please you. If you want to get into this band, then get this or the greatest hits. I'd say this over the GH but whichever you choose I guess. IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU ARE DEAF!

0307477479|4.0|One hundred years after Picasso pioneered the Cubist movement in art, we have Sandra Egan presenting the literary equivalent.  A cast of characters, friends from childhood, interact and move forward and backward in time through their intertwined lives.  Presented from multiple viewpoints, the story emerges.  Each chapter is a mini-short story illustrating the rise, mis-steps and downfalls.  Poignantly we see these all-too-humans move toward a grim crippled future New York, suddenly uplifted by the least likely to succeed character.   What worked: the method, constantly changing viewpoints held my attention.  What did not work for me: characters a bit too eccentric and selfish to really care about.   Overall, a solid read.
0553801473|3.0|All the momentum that Ice & Fire had at the end of A Clash of Kings has now been sapped from the story. The characters are getting spread so far and thin that I am starting to lose interest. The plot has likewise become too large and thin. I was looking forward to this book moving the serious forward, but few questions are addressed, almost none are resolved, and more are given. Everything is pretty much the same as it was at the end of A Clash of Kings, with few major plot developments. When you figure that A Feast for Crows and A Dance With Dragons are essentially one book, its hard to believe that so little could get accomplished in over 1500 pages. The characters are already developed, and they development little more. No one is moving anywhere, to fight or do anything. Out of three thousand pages, there are perhaps a half dozen major developments, and even those are somewhat minor in the big picture. Basically GRRM's last 1500 pages in this series equate to approximately half a novel worth of plot and character development. The other 1100 pages or so is just the characters acting in their continually cliche manners(cliche mostly in that we have read hundreds of pages about them, and they are already plenty well-developed)while going from point A to point B.
B004EPYZPI|4.0|I read the book and it was a very good legal thriller with smart twists. I thought they did a good job in the film, especially when you consider that it was a complex story. I thought McConaughey was perfectly cast as the cagey, street wise lawyer.
0765326353|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I had a hard time putting it down to go to work. It is filled with epic battles, lovable characters, both main characters and side characters, and the story flows from one character to the next almost seamlessly. I really loved almost everything about this book.    The problem I have with this book is not anything to do with the book itself, but the time when I found this book. I found this book by chance and have read it literally from cover to cover and loved every page. I was hooked from page one. But the second book is not out yet. I hate waiting for books. Normally I find a book after the second and possibly third book are out, but there aren't really even any rumors about book two yet. I love a good series(i.e. the Wheel of Time) but I hate to wait forever for each book. Well I guess I will be hating life until the next book comes out. I hope you will buy and read this book and be as anxious as I am for the rest of the story to unfold.

0790729407|5.0|If you would like to learn more about the great Michael Collins, this is the movie for you. The actress playing his girlfriend is the weakest part of the movie. I believe this movie is somewhat based on the book, Michael Collins, The Man Who Made Ireland. If you can, read the book and see the movie together. The book is so compelling, you may need to reread it. I did!

I look forward to her next book as well. She also discusses the work of other presentation designers: Garr Reynolds, Cliff Atkinson and Seth Godin.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and immediately purchased the other two in the trio.  I found this book through Amazon's suggestions for me, and got sucked in from the very beginning, laughing out loud several times.  Mr. Hearne's writing is very good, the story didn't leave me wondering &#34;huh?&#34; like something important had been edited out (which unfortunately happens more often than one might imagine) and I enjoyed the surprising twists and turns in the story.  I actually found it very believable even with all the crazy stuff going on.  I'm really looking forward to his other books and hope he is writing more as we speak!!<br /><br />If you enjoy urban fantasy, you'll like this book.  There isn't sex (not described anyway) but certainly a lot of violence and magic.  Thanks for a wonderful read!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I'm a slow reader and this book only took me 4 days to finish.  This character was strong.  She didn't give up.  She was determined.  She wanted to get better.  But what I couldn't understand is why didn't her husband want her too.  Why did he keep telling her that they tried everything but yet didn't want Dr. Nash to help?!  Never did I think of what happened, the thought never crossed my mind.  I thought the whole time Dr. Nash was her son and he so badly wanted to help her but couldn't tell her he was her son.  AMAZING read!
1463534124|5.0|It is always amazing to read something that was written over a hundred years ago and find it to be as relevant as ever, if not more so than it might originally have been.  \\"Orthodoxy\\" by G.K. Chesterton is just such a book, made the more extraordinary because it is his explanation of what led him from agnosticism to faith in Christianity.  Like C.S. Lewis, Chesterton's conversion was made through reason and philosophy and he allows readers to follow him on this intimate journey.<br /><br />It seems as if there is no topic untouched or question left unanswered.  Indeed, Chesterton found all the answers he needed in a place he never thought he would ever find them.  He examines the state of mankind and the world that we have created for ourselves, calling into question our practice of making truths without facts and changing our philosophical answers to meet our current needs.  In doing so, we are not making any change or impact or building anything better, merely running away from the truth and creating more confusion.  Chesterton debunks many of the stigmas that critics push onto the Christian church and popular beliefs (even for many today) that there is commonality among many religions, especially Christianity and Buddhism.<br /><br />It is almost too difficult to sum up what Chesterton had to say, for he covers much ground in a manner that is honest and straightforward but always intelligent, witty, and at times, very, very funny.  It is amazing to think he was only thirty-four years old when he wrote this, for his wisdom seems to belong to a much older man.  \\"Orthodoxy\\" is amazingly relevant for today's world, perhaps the best argument that indeed Chesterton had found and was able to explain that the answer he had found was the correct one.

0307887960|5.0|I started the diet on May 9 and lost 25 lbs to date.  I am two sizes smaller, 5 inches smaller in my waist, and 5 inches smaller in my hips and I feel great.  I left Weight Watchers to give this a try after seeing that Kate's mother (royal wedding) was on the plan.  Something about it peaked my interested.  I did some research and then Dr. Oz had it on his show and he was all for it.  The diet is easy to follow, the food is awesome, and I am never hungry.  You don't have to count points or food journal or anything extra.  Just have fun thinking of new ways to Dukanize your favorite recipes.  I highly recommend this diet and if you read some comment from a nutritionist who says anything bad then its because they haven't tried it.  Im sorry to say but most conventional nutritionist don't really help people.  My breakfast this morning was steak, eggs, and a chocolate milkshake thats just an example of how good it is...lol.  Oh yeah, don't forget to check out the Dukan Diet facebook page for support and recipe ideas.
1451629184|5.0|This is a candid, vivid account of Jaycee's nightmare.  I really respect that she did not avoid the raw truth of events.  It's the type of book you \\"don't want to read, but must\\".  It's NOT a depressing book -- it is INSPIRATIONAL, revealing the infinite depth of the human spirit.  If Jaycee could survive this ordeal, then we can all persevere as well.  Not self-pitying at all.  I did go away not fully understanding how she withstood the extreme isolation.<br /><br />Phil Garrido is a despicable, sick, selfish guy and the details of her misery illustrate it.  Nancy Garrido is shown to be a sicko as well.  The terror, isolation, cruelty is just horror.  The truth of this story is elucidated in the MUNDANE details she reveals -- it makes it so real.  Imagine using a crawling spider for \\"company\\".  And not crying because you cannot wipe away the tears when you are handcuffed. I thought I had a sense of what a human could endure and imagined this type of misery would definitely break a person.  But it DID NOT -- what a strong, beautiful soul Jaycee is.
0823003590|4.0|To be brief, this is a very helpful book on portrait drawing. The author uses clear and precise text to teach readers a consistent method used to tackle the human face. The chapters are broken down into segments that progress from the general to the specific. The author teaches the use of gesture, perspective, and the features of the face including the eyes, nose, ears, and mouth.    There are plenty of examples, a few step by step demonstrations, and even a chapter on concept design where he covers how to combine human and animal features to create your own original monsters; helpful for character designers like myself.
0375851569|5.0|[[ASIN:0375851569 Dr. Seuss's Beginner Book Collection (Cat in the Hat, One Fish Two Fish, Green Eggs and Ham, Hop on Pop, Fox in Socks)]]    I ordered this set for my 2 year old niece..and it is just terrific..nicely packaged. My niece LOVES the books as who wouldn't with these classics. She loves the characters and having someone read to her from them.   The order came quickly so I am very pleased and highly recommend them.
0553801473|1.0|I had thought a 1000+ page book would make up for those 5 long years of waiting. All it does is prove that \\"words are wind\\". We get to read about scrawny harts brought down by scouts named Benjicott Branch who then are never mentioned again. There are so many new bit players introduced that the book feels quite unrelated to the previous books. The chapters with the interesting characters are teasers - they lead nowhere in this book. I also felt like GRRM wrote this book with the HBO series in mind. There were too many convenient plot turns and chapter endings that would fit a tv show.<br />This book has killed my obsession with the series which is a good thing since I don't see it ending.

B004GHBQCE|5.0|Johnny Cash sings acoustic versions of NIN and Depeche Mode songs, and does it very well in his waning/dieing days. Gotta love it.  I still hear this version of Hurt on alternative radio stations, probably more often than the original NIN version.  The other songs are more typical country.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|Kudos to those of you who haven't read the book and were still able to follow this story! I read Deathly Hallows when it first came out but didn't remember much of it, and the movie did little to refresh my memory.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I rented it online, so there were no subtitles that would have helped me at least follow the fast, oftentimes whispered, mumbled or hissed dialogue. But even with subtitles, I doubt that the story would have been less confusing or more interesting.<br /><br />The flashback scenes (or whatever they were) were so fast and so short that most of them didn't make sense to me.<br /><br />The \\"guards\\" (or whatever they were) at the Ministry of Magic wore uniforms that were clearly inspired by the SS. Everybody else seemed to be in Muggle clothes. Why was nobody wearing robes? Wouldn't that have been part of Voldemort's cultural purification program?<br /><br />Why were Harry, Hermione and Ron Apparating around the country? What were they trying to accomplish? Did they think they would stumble across a Horcrux in the middle of a forest?<br /><br />What was up with that Bathilda Bagshot character at Godric's Hollow? Did she talk to Harry in Parseltongue? Shouldn't that have raised a red flag? Why was there no discussion between Harry and Hermione after Mrs. Bagshot turned into Nagini?<br /><br />I'm assuming the locket they were trying to destroy was Salazar Slytherin's, but was it ever explained in the movie?<br /><br />Why did Gryffindor's sword appear at the bottom of a lake, of all places? In the middle of winter, at that!<br /><br />What was the deal with the shining doe that led Harry to the sword? Who (or what) was it and where did it come from?<br /><br />Why did the friends not Apparate to safety when they were pursued by the bad guys (no idea who they were) in the forest?<br /><br />On a general note: 99% of the movie took place in poorly lit locations or at night, and I found the perpetual gloom annoying.<br /><br />The online video quality is not very good. We tried to watch it on our plasma TV but the picture was blurry and blotchy, and we couldn't figure out how to improve the resolution. It looked okay on my computer monitor, though.icture was blurry and blotchy, and we couldn't figure out how to improve the resolution. It looked okay on my computer monitor, though.
0956031609|3.0|This review is based on the Kindle version of the book as downloaded by Amazon.com.    This is unlikely to be a popular review (if it ever gets published with its proposed title) but there you go.    I read the \\"Kindle sample\\" of this book and a few \\"mainstream\\" reviews, and decided to give it a shot.  I almost immediately regretted the purchase. I had the idea that I \\"knew\\" that this narrative of early-apartheid South Africa was going to deal in stereotypes and create scenes I really did not want to read.  As it turned out, it was relatively frugal on the ugliness of South Africa's early apartheid regime. Equally so on the continuing realities of the murders of Indo-Pakistani women deemed to have defied their families and/or communities in search of love (or those who have been raped!!!)    Instead, it turned into a somewhat bizarre presentation of a lesbian's obsession with an otherwise \\"straight\\" woman whose only motivation (even within the confines of the novel) for her \\"loving\\" response to the aforesaid lesbian was emotional loneliness and an abusive husband.    Sarif gets 3 stars here because she is the first \\"gay\\" writer pushing a \\"gay agenda\\" I have read who could actually write. If she were not so consumed with justifying and promoting her sexual predilections, she could be an author who might be considered an equal to Khaled Hosseini.    Instead, as with her film work, she is more concerned in her writing to justify and glorify lesbianism, even leaving open, at the end of the novel, the fantasist's option that a lesbian's love will even overcome its object's innate heterosexuality.
1400031524|2.0|This is the second book by this author that I have read and am constantly dragged down by the awkward writing.    The story line was interesting, but the language was flat and terse.   The books do not exhibit a sense of location or richness of characters.      It is as bland and colorless as a winter landscape.   Perhaps that's the intention.    I wonder if the author is a poor writer or if the translation is just bad.    Perhaps a Swedish reader could elucidate.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Almost from the very beginning of her story, you have to remind yourself that this actually happened.  The first half of the book is very hard to read, Jaycee doesn't sugar coat anything that this evil couple did to her.  It's very courageous of her to even go back to those times in her mind, let alone put them into words that we are able to read.  She speaks very eloquently and plain about horrors that are unimaginable even after reading them.  I hope that she will be able to walk along a street without the fear of having a photo snapped of her, she's gone from one type of prison to another.  I pray that she and her family have continued success with their therapy and adjustment in to a whole \\"new\\" world, and may she and her children look at it with the awe and wonder of the beautiful 11 year old that was lost on that terrible day so many years ago.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I recently saw \\"Billy Elliot\\" at Windspear in Dallas...Came home and ordered the movie...Both were wonderful, heart warming, and funny...I recomend this movie for every one.....
B001HN6922|1.0|There are several decent reviews here (read them), my purpose it to add my two cents.  Movie was a huge disappointment to me and my children (ages 6 to 9).  A failure on many levels.  We loved the first Cars, and have watched it on dvd over and over and over again.  That won't be the case here.  My kids were even sorry we'd spent the money on the big screen, and they do not want the dvd at home - which says a lot!  If you just have to see it, don't pay more than $1.00 at Redbox.  .... What a tremendous bummer this movie turned out to be :-(
B003UESJ9M|1.0|Must be me but I just don't think Gwyneth Paltrow is that good looking.  And she was totally wrong for this movie role.  The script was so lame you found yourself wondering what and who you are supposed to care about in this movie.  Seems like there were bits and pieces of other movies fit together to try and create something.  I never did figure out what.  Billy Ray Cyrus meets Tammy Wynette maybe? Music was only thing salvageable in this movie and maybe that is what it is supposed to be - a promo for videos and cds.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Great movie for those who like the Rome/Jesus era. We added this newer collector's edition recently (not widescreen, though) to our growing Bible-type collection. The fire scene was a little scary for our younger ones (but then again we actually have had a house fire so maybe not such an issue for others) and I'm not a fan of suicide scenes (no matter how mild it is), but overall a real success for our family.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|Is there anyone else out there that has this nagging thought in the back of their mind, \\"Where have I seen this before?\\" Then it hits you, you've been watching, \\"The Son of the Revenge of the Return of The X-Men Part XXVI, The Next to the last Final Chapter.\\" Let's do the rundown, Good Wizards/Mutants over here, Bad Wizards/Mutants on the other side. Kindly, Good & Wise leader of the Good Wizards/Mutants is killed by the Bad Wizards/Mutants. The Bad Wizards/Mutants start a campaign against the poor Muggle's/Normal Humans. The Good Wizards/Mutants must stop this evil act. I can't go on.     Now here is the kicker, I probably would not have noticed the similarities if this movie hadn't been so poorly made. HP & TDH is by far the worst of the series so far.  What little dialog was present in the movie was very choppy and forced. The best actor in this installment was the CG Snake. The pace of the movie went from so boring that my eyes started to bleed, (how many times do we have to do the camping thing?), to disjointed and choppy warp speed. The majority of the scenes in this movie did not flow together well at all. They were more like someone unloading a delivery truck, first scene \\"bang\\" on the loading dock, second scene \\"bang\\", stacked on top, third scene \\"bang\\", you get my drift? Maybe a better term would be cookie cuttered?    Now for the DVD itself, Far too much compression. There were times that I thought that Hermione was about 7 feet tall and 125 pounds. Several of the shots of Harry's face were very distorted. The DVD was also so dark most of the time that it was very difficult to watch. On the plus side this movie did not have the huge volume swings that many modern movies have. The sound level was consistently reasonable throughout the film.    All & all, this movie is a must see only because you must see it before part 2. The worst of the movies in the series. If you're a fan, (as I am), you will buy it for your collection but you will seldom re-watch it.Spence the Elder  \\"Sic gorgiamus allos subjectatos nunc\\"   -M. Addams
0553801473|3.0|Martin's prose in the first three books was much better. It was concise, inventive and the wit as sharp as a Valyrian blade then. Now it's just plain redundant, just count the number of times he uses \\"words are wind,\\" \\"Jon Snow, you know nothing,\\" \\"Winter is coming\\", \\"[insert random situation] crossbow and Tywin joke,\\" and the oath the Black brothers take (I counted at least four instances when the oath was repeated verbatim). It is infuriating as a reader when you finally get to one of the primary characters and then half the POV turns out to be a recap of the previous books or elaboration of some irrelevant historical tid bit.<br /><br />I also have issues with Martins pacing. Compared to the frenetic pacing of the first three books (and a Storm in particular) the pacing in the last two books is glacial. It feels like Martin is stretching the story, introducing a bunch of new fringe characters and stuffing passages up with filler just so that the story can limp on till the seventh book. I sincerely hope the pace will pick up now (and it does towards the final third of Dance) and hopefully we'll get a fantastic finale the series deserves, ala a Storm.<br /><br />The series could have been so much better if the last two books were tighter, more controlled and less carefree with all the historical ramblings, introduction of minor characters and excessive fussing over minor details (remember Victarion's POV where he mentions the names of almost 30 ships, do we really need to know that?). Seems to me that GRRM might just be overwhelmed by the sheer scope of the world he's created. In all fairness this series really deserves an accompanying history text like the Silmarillon and hopefully that is where Martin will limit an extended history of Westeros and the Free Cities and not bog down Ice and Fire with it.<br /><br />These last two books (in my opinion Feast sets the low water mark much more so than Dance) fell short of the quality in storytelling and character building we have come to expect from Martin. It feels like Martin is stretching events and introducing new POVs to get to the seven book target for the series. Some of the fringe characters could have been eliminated and his \\"prose\\" could have been tightened to create a more eventful and gripping fourth book that combined events in a Feast and Dance without losing the momentum the series had generated so far in Storm. Sometimes less is more. But knowing Martin I wouldn't be surprised to get a Missandei POV in the future!!<br /><br />Dance is replete with a lot of positives as well. We see shades of the pre Feast GRRM returning and the pacing is beginning to pick up. So many characters are so tantalizingly close to coming face to face, and some do with dramatic consequences. Drogon puts in nothing less than an awesome cameo performance, hopefully the dragons will be the stars of the next book and not Cersei and her King's Court meddlings. New characters are introduced with one particularly influential one and a promise of more to come. This will sadly mean the end of several beloved POVs. A lot of POVs flatter to deceive and we get our fair share of waiting, pissing, food descriptions, eloquent sunset and sunrise settings and gladiatorial fights no less. The pacing of Dance does not really pick up till the final third but the evocatively languid descriptions of the Free Cities in particular help you appreciate the scope and beauty of Martins world. An entire \\"Lord of the Rings\\" could have taken place just in the shadow mountains of Asshai down South East and I'm sure Daenerys will get there (quickly though without waiting for the slow as snails ships thanks to the dragons). Events in Meereenese are coming to a head but the battle is left in a cliffhanger ending (cliffhangers abound in Dance). All in all I'm just thankful that GRRM seems to know where the story will go next and it looks like it'll be an amazing journey.<br /><br />Three stars from me for this book but GRRM,please pick up the pace from here on end!<br />-Still an avid Ice and Fire fan
B004Y1USV2|1.0|This album fails on virtually every level other than the cover art.      The title \\"suite\\" is hardly a suite at all -- it's five separate songs (with very loose lyrical connection) simply cross-faded into one another, with an \\"Overture\\" drawn from one of the songs at the beginning and a totally predictable reprise of the title song (and single) at the end.  \\"Fly From Here\\" the title single, a song written by The Buggles for Yes some 30 years ago that didn't make the cut for the band's DRAMA album, is the only track here that even comes close to capturing the sound and feel of the band known as Yes.  The second section of the \\"suite\\" is also drawn from a 30 year old discarded Buggles song and the third section, \\"Madman At The Screens\\" land us squarely in Bugglesville.  When the instrumental \\"Bumpy Ride\\" fades in, Yes becomes a mockery of itself, almost sounding as if they purposely want to insult prog music as a genre.      This is an album of pop tunes primarily written by Trevor Horn and Geoff Downes (The Buggles of \\"Video Killed The Radio Star\\" fame) and as Buggles music, it is catchy and well done.  As Yes music, it lands far short of the mark, chasing a long gone Yes style with little relevance to progression in 2011.  Instead of developing an album of new Yes music with amazing lead runs, driving progressive rhythms, and lyrics that beckon contemplation and emotional response, this is an album of Yes covering Buggles pop tunes and feebly attempting to infuse them with the power of Yes' arranging style.      Beyond the \\"suite\\", the other tracks are even weaker.  When Chris Squire takes lead vocal duties on the song \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be\\", between the overly trite lyrics and the horrifyingly commercial songwriting, he actually manages to render the single worst piece of radio pop ever to appear on a Yes album.  This song literally makes me gag.  Those who were hoping Yes might not be as sappy without Jon Anderson will freak when they hear this one.\\"Life On A Film Set\\" is yet another 30 year old discarded Buggles song (it was originally called \\"Riding A Tiger\\" and appeared on the reissue of their ADVENTURES IN MODERN RECORDING album).  Like the other tracks, it's not a bad song for The Buggles, but for Yes it is meaningless fodder, both musically and lyrically.      \\"Hour of Need\\", one of the only songs on the album primarily coming from Steve Howe, sounds oddly like Trevor Rabin era Yes, particularly the song \\"Walls\\" from the TALK album.  This song has better lyrics than the rest of the album but it is musically uninteresting other than the vocal harmonies, which still come up short of actually sounding like Yes.      \\"Solitaire\\" is Steve Howe's obigiitory acoustic guitar solo but instead of having the fun join in feel of \\"The Clap\\" or the stirring immediacy of \\"Mood For A Day\\", here his performance is soft edged, failing to compel the listener's full attention and lacking emotional impact.      The final track of the album is \\"Into The Storm\\".  It tries so hard to sound like Yes, it feels desperate and, again, empty.  Squire tries to capitalize on the feel of bass driven tracks like \\"Does It Really Happen\\" from DRAMA and \\"On The Silent Wings of Freedom\\" from TORMATO, but the songwriting leaves it sounding purely Buggles, except for the refrain, where new lead vocalis Benoit David's singing style makes the track sound exactly like Benoit's \\"other band\\", MYSTERY.  Couple that with Geoff Downes ASIA sounding keyboard work, and this piece of pop music is clearly not the progressive rock from Yes it pretends to be.      Producer Trevor Horn, formerly Yes' lead singer on the Drama album, has left the lead vocals overly dry throughout, sometimes even lacking appropriate reverb and too high in the mix at odd places.  Guitarist Steve Howe lacks punch, with meandering lead lines that build no excitement and offering few of the power chords he used to make the DRAMA album so rich and lively.  Keyboardist Geoff Downes sticks to electronic sounds for the most part, adding very little acoustic feel from the keys (other than a brief piano intro at the top of the album) and his usual wall of sound overwhelms the rest of the band, giving this album the feel of a new Buggles record with three guys from Yes sitting in -- not the other way around.      New vocalist Benoit David is not bad but he adds very little to the project.  He does not contribute as a songwriter and his voice offers nothing particularly unique to make him or the songs memorable.  Yes could have hired a professional singer with a voice and a range and writing capability that could have taken the band to new heights for a new generation.  Instead, they have opted for an lackluster amateur impersonator from a Yes tribute band, apparently so guitarist Howe and bassist Squire can be the center of focus.  On tour, he imitates Jon Anderson vocally; on this album, he imitates producer Trevor Horn from Yes' Drama album (big surprise).      Gone is the mysticism of Jon Anderson's heartfelt poetry, replaced here with the empty, confusing and ultimately meaningless lyrics of Trevor Horn (actually billed in advertisement for the album as \\"cool Yes like lyrics\\", if you can believe it).  But it's not just the voice and words of Jon Anderson that are missing here, it's also his hand in the songwriting and the arranging, leaving the current Yes sounding hollow, empty, lifeless, and uninspired.      Jon Anderson's new solo album, SURVIVAL & OTHER STORIES, with its rich songwriting, excellent arranging, heartfelt lyrics, and the voice of Jon Anderson (also available here on Amazon), comes far closer to the feel of Yes than Yes' FLY FROM HERE -- which is nothing more than a lame rehashing of 30 year old discards and new Buggles songs.  Without Jon Anderson on board, Yes has nothing new to offer.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|After the awesomeness of A Storm of Swords (Oberyn Martell aka the Red Viper is amazing!) Feast is a veritable snooze fest. Nothing of note happens and the pages are dominated by characters I couldn't care less about (that's being too harsh maybe not all but I couldn't care less about Cersei though). GRRM thinks he's the next Tolkien but Tolkien was consistent! Consistently good in the LOTR series, the Hobbit as well as the Silmarillon. GRRM is way too inconsistent. I would rank Storm alongside the Two Towers but Feast really is such a shocking fall from grace. It feels like Martin is trying to stretch the series over seven books by using filler material. Jaime, Cersei and Brienne are not even amongst the five most important characters in Ice and Fire in the grand scheme of things yet they take up 70% of this novel. Relative to Martins previous work this book is worth less than two stars.<br /><br />-rant over
B0055D3EOG|5.0|I love horror movie's.. but the last couple of years since Saw was so popular.. it's been nothing but gore and more gore.. for once this movie brings back the genre of \\"horror\\" and truly grips you, from beginning to end. It delivers when it comes to horror. It was done very well.. from acting, scripting, and music! The eery music add's to the classic horror film feel and the rest kicks it up a notch to bring a new level of horror not seen in movies in years.
B0057KXXFM|1.0|I was there LIVE at Korn's Life is Peachy Tour when Limp Bizkit opened for Helmet & Korn. They rocked that night opening with Counterfeit & breaking out the Faith song they redid. Fred Durst & Sam Rivers walked around that night handing out 3 song demos on cassette tapes, YES CASSETTE TAPES! That was Limp Bizkit then, but after Three Dollar Bills Y'all they SOLD OUT & things went down hill for them fast! I was also there during the Tour where they got booed off stage by an angry Metallica crowd in Chicago, & that says it all. Fred was a cocky arrogant A-hole that night & I'm shocked none of them didn't get lynched by a mob of 60,000+ metal heads! I could barely see Limp on stage because of all the garbage & rocks that were being thrown at them & they deserved it trust me! Since I was there from the start, I had to see for myself how bad this album was so I pre-viewed the songs & that's all I needed to hear. IT SUCKS! I would like to give this album -5 stars but Amazon doesn't have that option, so I gave it 1 just to post this. In fact Limp Bizkit SUCKS & they lost me as a fan long ago. Hey Fred, IF you ever read this... GO AWAY cause things will get worse you Axl Rose wannabe! DJ Lethal, go back to House of Pain! Sam & John, start a new band! & Wes, join Korn since Head is gone now! I bet Korn themselves are regretting EVER helping Limp Bizkit get big. You can now call them LIMP BIZQUIT, enough said!

B004W648Y2|5.0|\\"Arthur\\" is one of the really great Kinks albums, so it only logical and to release it in a deluxe version. Musically the group was really progressing at this point, and the compositions are generally more complex than on their previous album \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\".<br /><br />Ray Davies had big ambitions with his music, and the songs were originally written for for a TV drama which unfortunately never materialized.<br /><br />The original album contains well-known classics like \\"Victoria\\", \\"Shangrila\\" and \\"Drivin'\\" along with lesser known gems like \\"Some Mother's Son\\", \\"Young and Innocent Days\\" and \\"Mr Churchill Says\\".<br /><br />Both the mono and stereo version are included on a seperate CD, and they both sound great - in fact many songs have a very similar sound to the songs on the early RCA albums.<br /><br />Both the CDs are supplemented with great bonus-track among several are previously unreleased and others rare and hard to find.<br /><br />Interesting that it is now possible to compile most the great unreleased Dave Davies solo album, \\"A Hole in the Sock\\", if you have this CD and the deluxe versions of \\"The Village Green Preservation Society\\" and \\"Something Else by the Kinks\\".<br /><br />The songs that were released as Dave Davies solo-singles all are great and sound better than ever. \\"Mr Shoemaker's Daughter\\" and \\"Mr Reporter\\" also sound good, though the first may only be in a demo-state. Another great song from the album \\"Groovy Movies\\" was included on \\"VGPS\\".  Only three songs have never been officially released, and apparently the master-tapes are lost. The three songs \\"Do You Wish to be a Man\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Are You Ready\\" can be found on bootleg albums, but in very poor sound. A big shame, since all songs are quite good. In fact it the album would have been pretty strong.<br /><br />In short: This new deleuxe release can only be highly recommended.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Susans music. I need to hear her sing something faster too...and the God praising melodies and hymns I like.....sacred Music, as opposed to Gospel or the new modern church music.
1440503257|5.0|Last night we had a Harry Potter party in honor of the release of the last film, and wanted to make the same meals that might be served at Hogwarts.  I made everything using this cookbook - roast beef, Yorkshire pudding, Brussels sprouts with Bechamel sauce, boiled potatoes with herb vinaigrette, treacle tart, and spotted dick.  I'd never made or eaten any of it (besides roast beef) before, and it was SO GOOD!  Every single person at the party raved, even people who have spent time in Great Britain. We'd actually made everything ahead of time and reheated it all in a 250 oven - it was fantastic.  I definitely recommend this to all fans - however, the spotted dick steaming instructions were kind of confusing.  I used this website instead:  [...]    These recipes are definitely new favorites and I'll be making these again in the future, and probably trying out a lot of other things in the book as well.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|A very nice start for Adele with this Album 19. I discovered Adele after listening to her newer album 21, so for me it's still a better one. But 19 is definitely worth the money. It's different than 21, most songs only employ one accompany instrument; so if you like the texture of her songs in 21, it will definitely take a little while to get used to. However, the bonus point of this is that you get to appreciate the raw quality of her voice to its fullest.
B00005N6KG|5.0|They better keep making these. I have been using them for the last 14 yrs. I have the same two pairs, and they still work..
1451629184|5.0|This book was a easy quick read with lots of details about the events that occurred in the last 18 yrs. I read the book before watching the ABC special which was nice for putting a story to a face. I wish she went more into our children since I imagine this has been very hard on them however she is very protective of their privacy.
0553801473|5.0|I'm a bit disgusted at all of the reviews that mention how long they had to wait or how book 6 is going to take oh so long. You'll notice that almost all of these \\"complaints\\" have nothing to do with the actual book. No, the actual book is quite amazing.<br /><br />Martin's prose is better than ever, and we can finally see him bringing together the two massive threads of this series (the story of Westeros from the first three books, and Dany's plight in Essos). Yep. This is more set up, just like Feast. No, it does not conclude the story. Why on earth would it? There are two more books still to come! I have to wonder if some of these people who claim that the book is such a disappointment even realize what the word \\"series\\" means. Of course there are cliffhangers and unresolved plotlines. THERE'S MORE TO COME. Why the hell would anything be resolved after only 5 books?<br /><br />Anyone sensible, who can actually stop and think logically for a second, will agree that this is yet another brilliant entry in the series, and I can only imagine how intense the Winds of Winter is going to be. Now that the Mereenese knot is undone, hopefully Martin can push full force into concluding the series in a satisfying manner. I know I can't wait.
B004ETVAH0|5.0|I originally bought the DVD version of this performance, but then had to have it with me on the road and purchased the cd.  While I like roc-a-billy I've never been a huge fan.  That is until Jeff Beck honored the music of Les Paul and other greats of that era.  It came as no surprize to me that Jeff Beck delivered another magnificent performance.  However, the real treat here is Imelda May and her band.  Fantastic!
B004EC5IUW|5.0|omg. i want to die. i love this movie. If you have not seen evangelion 1.11 get it, 2.22 had my full attention, which i very rare. i would suggest this movie to anyone who likes gundam, evangelion, eureka 7, etc. its one of the best anime films i personally have ever seen. i want the next one.
B0034G4P8U|5.0|In 2007, executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Michael Bay delivered to audiences walking, talking, robots in disguise with \\"Transformers\\". The summer blockbuster took the box office by storm and raised the bar for visual effects extravaganzas at the movies.    Two years later, Spielberg and Bay did it again with the outstanding follow-up (although many would contest my usage of the word \\"outstanding\\" in regards to that film) \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\". Once more this franchise blew away box office expectations and elevated the aforementioned bar even higher.    Now, here we are in 2011, and like clockwork a third Transformers film has arrived in theaters under the guidance of the previously mentioned executive producer and director. So, does \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" have what it takes to surpass its predecessors or do these robots in disguise need to go back to Cybertron?    \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" begins a few years after the last film as Sam (Shia LaBeouf) has graduated college, has a new girlfriend (Rosie Huntington-Whitely), and is looking for a job. Meanwhile, the Autobots are still working alongside the U.S. government to protect the planet from future Decepticon attacks. However, the tide of war is about to change as the Decepticons are working to reassemble a recently discovered Cybertronian technology that could resurrect the long-dead planet of Cybertron and destroy the Earth in the process.    Regarding the question I asked a moment ago, whether or not this film has what it takes, the answer is an absolute \\"YES\\", without a doubt! If you were one of the moviegoers that felt disappointed by the last installment, this newest entry will easily erase any lingering ill will you may still be harboring towards this franchise.    Written by Ehren Kruger (the only returning screenwriter from the previous film), this film boasts the biggest story, the craziest action and visual effects to feast your eyes upon, and stakes thatfeel higher than ever before. Plus, the story actually strikes a few surprising emotional chords that I didn't expect; resulting in a movie that feels much more mature and grown up than the other installments.    The previous film, although I found to be enjoyable, many felt was inferior to the original by having a story that was overly convoluted and over-the-top. Personally, I disagree, but that was the major consensus, so I'm in the minority.    This newest movie boasts a much more streamlined plot that is more centralized and focused on a few major set pieces as opposed to the globe-trotting escapades of its predecessor. By taking this approach some might wonder if the final product seems scaled back by comparison.    The answer: yes and no.    In my opinion, the film feels easily as epic in scope as the previous one, in terms of the action on display and the threat being leveled by the Decepticons. But the main story does feel somewhat smaller, more inline with the original film. It sort of brings everything full circle, back to the basic concept of a young man thrust into an extraordinary situation.    Truth be told, I think this was the best approach for the movie. Reason being, since this is Bay's supposed last go-round with the franchise; the film serves as a very nice bookend to the story that began four years ago with the original.    Another area that became a bit smaller is the cast of Transformers in the film. Unlike the last entry, where the number of robot characters increased dramatically; this time around, the core group of Transformers is relatively the same size as the original movie, just with some new faces.    This more concise core cast of Transformers is a wise choice as it provides audiences a chance to get to know who these various robots are and see more of their distinct personalities on display. Thus, allowing us viewers to develop an emotional investment in them, so that they actually become real characters to us and not just CGI creations.    While the robot cast may have downsized a bit, the human cast of characters the story focuses upon is much larger than ever before.    Leading the cast once again is Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky. By now, Shia is undoubtedly as comfortable playing Sam as he is in his own skin. Such familiarity with a character could lead to boredom seeping into an actor's performance, but not with Shia.    It's clear that Shia has grown over the course of these films right along with his character, and this time around everything about his performance feels so much more relaxed, natural, and mature. That's not to say that Shia's wit has died down as a result, far from it in fact. His comedic timing seems better than ever, and his one-liners and sarcastic observations are much keener than previously seen.    Next to Shia, through much of the film, is a new leading lady, played by model turned actress Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. Some may miss former lead actress Megan Fox, whose departure from the film was highly publicized, but Rosie does a good job of stepping in as Shia's new girlfriend Carly. And as surprising as this may seem, Rosie actually is a decent actress, delivering a much more consistent performance than Megan did in either of her two outings.    Other returning cast members fleshing out the familiar supporting roles are Josh Duhamel as Lt. Colonel Lennox, Tyrese Gibson as Epps, and John Turturro as former S7 agent, Seymour Simmons.    Each of these actors get their time to shine in this film, just as they did in the previous two, but their characters feel more naturally integrated into the story than ever before. For instance, this time around the military's involvement seemed more logical due to the presence of Transformers on Earth no longer being kept secret.    As for Simmons, his involvement wasn't pure coincidence as it was last time. With the Transformers operating openly in the public, inserting Simmons into the action felt like an obvious choice given hischaracter's obsession with the robots.    Speaking of John Turturro's character, I thought the eccentric nature of Simmons really fit with his demoted status quo in the last film. However, now that he's a filthy rich author due to his conspiracy theories and first-hand knowledge of the Transformers, his quirks are even better suited to the character.    Now some complain that John Turturro's performance as Simmons has always threatened to derail these movies. Personally, I've always gotten a big kick out of his portrayal and feel that just like everything else in this film, he's never been better.    Also, showing up in two brief cameo appearances are character actors, Julie White and Kevin Dunn, as Sam's parents. I have enjoyed their characters every time they have appeared in the previous movies, and I was glad to see they were included yet again.    Once more we are given several hilarious one-liners, especially from Julie as Sam's boundary-ignoring, borderline inappropriate mother. Sadly though, we were only given their two short appearances in the film. I for one would have enjoyed seeing more of them again, but honestly they wouldn't have really fit into the story, so it was probably for the best.    Newcomers to the cast, aside from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, are several high-profile, A-list actors and actresses ranging from John Malkovich (\\"Con Air\\") and Frances McDormand (\\"Fargo\\") to Alan Tudyk (\\"A Knight's Tale\\") and the increasingly popular Ken Jeong (\\"The Hangover\\"). While some of these characters had moments of seriousness, Frances McDormand's character being the most serious-minded; for the most part, they all delivered great bits of levity amidst the robo-led apocalypse descending upon mankind.    Alongside the actors appearing on the screen were the talented voice-over actors breathing life into the CGI-created Transformers. Each voice-over cast member delivered excellent work and made their characters really feel alive to the audience. As always the sound of Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime continues to make those of us who grew up watching the 1980's animated series feel like kids again.    Joining the voice-over cast is the legendary Leonard Nimoy (\\"Star Trek\\") as the long-lost Autobot, Sentinel Prime. Leonard's gravelly voice brought a sense of gravitas and authority that was vital to the portrayal of Optimus' predecessor. Plus, the nod or two to Leonard's history as Spock from \\"Star Trek\\" was a fun little easter egg for fans to look and listen for.    Of course, with these films all of the cast and crew's hard work would be for naught if it wasn't for the outstanding visual effects work. As with the previous two movies, the bar for CGI in film has been raised once more. The realism on display when bringing the two warring factions of Transformers to life continues to be astounding. Not to mention, the final hour alone, when the war really comes to a crescendo, makes the whole movie worth watching.    So after all that, I leave you with this final thought. If you are one of the numerous fans who lost interest in this franchise after the perceived horror that was \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\", then this latest installment will erase that pain and make you remember what it's like to be a kid again.    And in the end, just like its predecessors, \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" is the epitome of what a summer blockbuster is supposed to be and proud of it.    \\"Transformers: Dark of the Moon\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
0307716511|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I am sure my blood presuure is the worse for wear. I would recommend this to all but the faint of heart. I liked everything about it. More than that I will not say in consideration for those who have yet to receive the book. Enjoy
B0034G4ORC|1.0|So I watched this movie last week and I was looking forward to it. I could NOT keep track of all the freaking characters there was way too many for a movie where you rarely can see their faces and mostly see the uniform their wearing which are all the exact same.

0062060554|4.0|Waking after a one-night stand with a strange married man is disturbing enough, but a look in a bathroom mirror that shows twenty-year overnight aging - the gray hair and wrinkles - is truly frightening. But none of that is true. Christine learns from that man, her husband Ben, that she has to start over every day in understanding even the most basic details in her life. According to Ben, a brain injury in a hit-and-run incident left her with a strange case of amnesia, whereby all she learns in a day is forgotten after a deep sleep, let alone any memories from the past twenty years. It was a twenty-year-old's visage that she remembered and expected to see in the mirror.<br /><br />But is there any hope, a way out of this incapacitating condition? Fortunately, Dr. Ed Nash, a neurologist with an interest in her case, intrudes into Chrissy's passive days by persuading her to keep a journal and visit places from her past, all of which is concealed from Ben who rejects such intervention. He must call every morning on a private phone to tell her anew where her journal is hidden. Miraculously, snatches from her past float through her consciousness, which she surreptitiously records. She seems to have had a close friend; she has apparently written a book; and there is a scenario that has all the feel of an affair.<br /><br />The tension in the story is kept high as Chrissy accumulates more and more tentative knowledge that she must relearn each day, but cannot inadvertently speak of with her husband - never being sure what they had discussed that day. Ben grudgingly admits that he has not been entirely forthcoming about Chrissy's past, supposedly to keep from exciting her. And Chrissy never knows whether she can trust what she has discovered: has she truly remembered or has she merely constructed images. She struggles with her relationship with Ben. For example, does she love him; there are no memories on which to base any such feelings. He disturbs her enough that at some point she wrote in her journal: DON'T TRUST BEN.<br /><br />Despite a certain repetitiveness, the story is compelling. In the author's telling, it is a bit too easy to take advantage of an amnesiac - other than the unofficial interest of Dr. Nash, the lack of institutional support is noticeable. It finally comes down to whether Chrissy will be able to somehow tap into her past sufficiently to pull herself out of her perpetual night - a darkness with some puzzling disconnects.her journal: DON'T TRUST BEN.

B003Y5H53S|2.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released... And finally got released yesterday and I went to blockbuster right away and rented it. I am also a huge Johnny Depp fan, I mean HUGE! I love him, but I didn't really think that this movie was funny. I am so glad he had fun making this movie and I liked the little reference to one of his earlier movies in the beginning. I loved the lizard character and I thought he was an adorable animal but not that funny. I liked the change up of movies that Johnny did though! Good job!
B0055FR5PS|4.0|I saw this in the theater, and I just rented it to watch again. It's a solid, exciting and well-executed war movie. It's really only science fiction in that the invading opponent is not from Earth. In actuality, it's genetically much closer to The Big Red One than it is to something like District 9.    The entire film sticks to the ground-level perspective of a squad of fighters from various branches of the US Armed Forces in combat with the enemy. We don't get a god's eye view of the action, we only see what the squad sees.    The story has a very engaging arc and development. The action is very well directed and staged. The director and editor don't rely on rapid cuts and confusion as their only tools to create tension. Instead, they give the viewer enough visual information to get a sense of where things are happening in relation to each other, which enables the viewer to see tactics in action an assess their progress toward success or failure. They succeed at this without sacrificing visual dynamism and energy. For me, this approach is much more satisfying.    There are elements that seem cliche - character types and motivations - but the movie is so well put together that these were not problematic.
B0000AGQ6Y|5.0|Unlike the edited movie release version, this uncut version completely explains the complicated relationship between Leon and Mathilda not merely as father-daughter, brother-sister or friend-to-friend but more impportantly as lovers. Although this brought about some uneasiness to the viewer, it is an important point for the whole plot.
0545259088|3.0|This is going to be a hard review for me to write! I hate writing reviews when I didn't really connect with the story but I feel like because I wrote reviews on the last to books I should conclude the series.<br /><br />I loved reading Shiver!  There was a tiny part of me that felt like I shouldn't continue reading after Shiver but I really connected with Grace and Sam and I wanted to find out what happens with their story.  Then I read Linger and I was a bit frustrated at what happened with them and the story just didn't flow well.  However, I thought that Forever would clear up any frustrations I had and leave me satisfied with a good conclusion.  I was wrong!<br /><br />In Forever there was a lot about Isabel and Cole and not so much about Sam and Grace, the true characters of the Wolves of Mercy Falls.  It's not that I don't enjoy Isabel and Cole, I actually did and I was okay for the most part that a lot of the story was about them because I wanted to see them grow and work through all their issues.  I never really felt like that happened with them.  The resolution with them felt false and the ending just didn't click with me.<br /><br />The best thing about this series was Sam and Grace.  Yet in Forever we are left with only tiny tidbits of their connection and it felt forced.  The reunion was awful and I was so disappointed in the scenes that involved them. I was more impressed when they weren't together but were thinking of each other than I was when they were together.  There was just a huge lack of emotional connection.<br /><br />There was a lot of issues completely unresolved or resolved weird.  For instance, things were never really concluded with Grace and her parents, well they sort of were but we are left still wondering.  The cure and its conclusion sucked and I was disappointed how that ended.  The ending was frustrating and you are left to try to understand what happened and who survived and who is cured or not. I guess the author wanted you to come to your conclusion but there were just too many unresolved issues to come to a conclusion that I enjoyed on my own.<br /><br />I know that Stiefvater is a good writer because it was very evident in Shiver and even though I was very un-satisfied with Forever, it wasn't for the lack of good writing.<br /><br />Now that I'm done with the series, I look back and think that I probably wasted my money buying all the books.  I should have never kept reading after Shiver and in fact I probably would have been fine if I never read Shiver to begin with.  I am disappointed.were just too many unresolved issues to come to a conclusion that I enjoyed on my own.

I should have never kept reading after Shiver and in fact I probably would have been fine if I never read Shiver to begin with.  I am disappointed.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|Great movie-just watched it with my daughters that are 14 and 11.  They loved  it to.  My 14 year old is reading the book for an English assignment and   thought it would be great to see the movie.  Excellent!!
B004Y1USV2|5.0|This is the strangest YES album of all time. It's rather chameleon like, being more like 2 different bands come together.    Once upon a time (1979/80), Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman quit YES, the rest of the band joined up with The BUGGLES--Trevor Horn & Geoff Downes--to keep YES going and produced the amazing hybrid album, DRAMA. The music was part YES, part BUGGLES songs. While hardcore YES fans didn't take to it, it was a rather modern and remarkable album that has stood the test of time, still sounding fresh today. That version of the band lasted one tour and one album before imploding. But the BUGGLES had made their mark with the prophetic song/video, \\"Video Killed The Radio Star.\\" And Trevor Horn went on to produce a lot of hits with The Art of Noise, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, Grace Jones, Propaganda, and many others. Geoff Downes went on to mega-success (along with YES' Steve Howe) to form ASIA.    10 years later, a reformed YES  (without Downes or Howe), once again with Jon Anderson on vocals, brought in now famous producer, Trevor Horn, to helm their new album. The result was 90125, an album which produced the hit, \\"Owner Of A Lonely Heart,\\" and YES was reborn, becoming as big as ever.    Now it's 20 more years later and Jon Anderson has been gone for a few years, replaced by the young Benoit David. The band, older and struggling to still be relevant in today's changing music scene, brought in legendary producer Trevor Horn to produce their new effort. Along the way, keyboardist Geoff Downes joined the band again and the circle was complete.     Horn brought along 2 old BUGGLES tunes, one, the 23 minute title track, which YES had played live, but never recorded (2 parts of it were on the expanded 2nd BUGGLES release, ADVENTURES IN MODERN RECORDING). The other track, \\"Riding The Tide\\" (also on the 2nd BUGGLES release), was redone as \\"Life On A Film Set.\\" The sound of the whole album is vintage Horn/BUGGLES. The production is crisp and very cinematic.    So Trevor Horn has resurrected YES from the ashes for a third time. Will the third time be a charm? Hopefully the band will retain the services of Horn as producer/collaborator, as he seems to know how to bring out the best in the band and give it a modern edge.    If you are a fan of the DRAMA album, the BUGGLES, or Trevor Horn, you will love this album. If you are a hardcore YES fan, you may hesitate to let the music get under your skin, but let it, you'll be better off for it.
0071762345|5.0|I have read dozens of books on social media, and hundreds of books about marketing. I have also attended expensive seminars and done whatever I could to learn about social media for my small business. I have also been looking for a tool to help teach my staff without having to send them to weekend classes. Well...this book not only helped me to tie it all in in my own head...but I plan on ordering several copies for my staff so that they can get a handle on what social media and being \\"likeable\\" really is. Dave distills what can be a complicated subject to get a handle on, into to easy to understand plain English. Not only that...he gives you ideas that you can put into action right now. So whether you are somewhat seasoned like me...or know nothing about social media...this book is for you. Thanks Dave for your masterpiece. Well Done!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I suggested this to my bookclub after reading a Q&A with Ransom Riggs here on Amazon. It's our August book, but I started reading it immediately, as I was so keen, and I simply could not put it down. A wonderfully escapist story, that is well structured and imaginatively written. I really hope there is a follow up book in the works, as I would love to delve into this world again.
0553801473|2.0|Preface: I read book #1 of this series in the summer of 1997. It pains me that 14 years have elapsed and this story is not only still incomplete, but more sprawling than ever. As others have noted, there are certain similarities to Robert Jordan. I abandoned him in 1994. Martin is a much better writer, however.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />- the reviews of this book would not be so tepid had A. Martin not stated upon the release of the previous book that this one was largely already written, B. were it actually a decent continuation of the previous books, and C. had this large tome arrived somewhat sooner.<br /><br />- Martin has too many threads going, as others have noted. I don't want to feel as though I need an encyclopedia to read and remember a good fantasy.<br /><br />- Many chapters of this book were just plain tedious and I scanned them.<br /><br />- The better characters (Dany, Tyrion, Jon) spend this book bogged down, seemingly getting nowhere. The events they're caught in may have larger significance but it translates to tedium in this book, when no one gets anywhere.<br /><br />- When I started the series and Martin killed off Ned Stark, I applauded that as a ballsy move in a genre where main characters often have little of note befall them. However, his insistence on killing or maiming just about EVERY character of note that he has introduced has become tiresome. As a reader I need something to keep me going, and I'm not finding much here. I want to hold on to those good early characters and not be introduced to hordes of new ones . . . . but that's not the way things are unfolding. And I don't much like the new ones. They come too late.<br /><br />Bottom line: winter is still coming, Jon Snow still knows nothing, Tyrion is cruder than ever, Arya's storyline seems so deviant as to never return, Sansa is missing entirely, Jaime, Brienne and Cersei were almost absent, and the chapters' incessant globetrotting in this book is hard to keep up with. It was good to be back in Martin's world, and I hope it's not another 5 years until the next one, but I skimmed the last half of this book and feel as though I missed nothing of import.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. A wonderful novel about the strong ties of family and hope in times of despair.
B004ULEEY8|1.0|This movie is not only boring to hell but packs a plethora of subliminal messages aimed at the young and dumbed down generation. I guess \\"uncle\\" sam aka big brother is using this movie as a front to boost army enrollment and promote fear against a possible alien encounter (be it friendly or not).  If you get thrills at this type of propaganda this movie was made just for you.    Just think, why so many movies lately about alien invasions (Battle LA, Skyline etc?) The government is up to something and as always we're \\"entertained\\".
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The absolute horror of such an experience at 11yrs old. For 18 years, this sick bastard kept her hostage & was being visited by parole officers!! For 18 years, Phillip was getting psychiatric treatment for voices and delusions.   This was a very hard book to read. I put it down a lot, especially in the beginning. Jaycee put everything out on the table. She was very candid and honest and I think this book was probably very therapeutic for her. I fear for our kids when the system failed Jaycee for so long, and there are a million more sick bastards out the with their equally enabling and sick wives!   I also watched the Diane Sawyer interview, and Jaycee appears pretty together, which shows just how strong she is.   This book saddens, yet inspires. We all just need to make sure we watch our kids closely.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Just pre ordered it...I've been waiting for the Blu Ray Trilogy.... can wait till it's released and I receive it so I can watch it all day long..I love all 3 Jurassic Park, the best movies of all times!
B003YL4LYI|1.0|Had to give it a star due to there rating system. Wanted to be a minus but can't. If you did not know how to right the end of the book I wished that instead if the volumes of pages written I wish he just said on the second page . (then they all were run over by a bus). Would have been better reading then the dribble that was put upon the pages.( Poor Jon Et Tu Martin )
0525425578|4.0|Storyline - When April, Theo's best friend, disappears, he starts investigating and searching different areas of town with the help of friends in hopes of locating her. But as time goes on, the stakes get higher and April seems to be slipping more and more from their reach. Will they find her? And who is Leeper, a man convicted of kidnapping who just escaped from prison and has been seen within town? Did he take her like everyone thinks?    Personal Opinion - The book was pretty good. Because of the cover, I kept waiting for Theo to go somewhere alone at night but he never did which I was thankful for. Too smart for that I guess. One of my favorite parts, besides the exciting and mysterious mystery of the missing April, was the funny spot in middle of the book which broke up the tense situation. The story was well developed and the mystery progressed well, making you wonder what was going to and what did happen to his friend. Wondering if she was okay and if they would find her in time. Wished it had developed some side characters more, especially one boy because of how much this he was in the story, and had toned back on the lying. This book will interest more readers than just those who want to be lawyers with the exciting storyline it promises. The book leaves you with a hint of a third book, which, perhaps, will continue the mystery of the first book (maybe I shouldn't have said that. Gave too much away perhaps?).
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|This is what the producer originally desired.   A must see in German with English subtitles.  Yes it is long...yes it has boring parts and that precisely is the point.  War is hours of boredom punctuated with moments of terror.  The drama and unprofessional behavior by the crew is in some places unrealistic but  understandable and certainly forgivable.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|I'll be the first to say that I believe Ben Stiller to be overrated, but he impressed me with this hilarious movie. Tom Cruise could be reason alone to watch this flick.
B0001Z52RU|4.0|I thought this was a very engaging story, with very good character acting. The sci-fi mechanism is handled with a minimum of fuss, and lets the character-driven story shine. I haven't seen any other analysis that touches on this point: I think \\"The Butterfly Effect\\", that a single small event has massive repurcusions downstream in time, is an extended metaphore for the latency effects of child abuse, which is the real (and terrible) event at the center of this film. Many reviewers complained about the unrelieved grimness of the events in the narrative, but it only goes to show that the Freudian \\"return of the repressed\\" repeats the grimness of the original event. Try as he may, the main character can't seem to stop (or block out) all the repurcussions of the original child abuse event. The metaphore is given filmic visual gravitas in the image of the \\"perfect\\" gabled house (the mailbox which perfectly models the house behind it) being blown apart violently, an unconscious acting out of violence by the kids who were damaged by the abusive father -- an image that says that families are blown apart by domestic sexual abuse, which says the \\"address\\" of the issue is the home where it starts. Looked at in this light, the narrative is cohesive and justified. An excellent film that is underrated in my opinion.
B000E5N6LG|4.0|It's too bad this movie came out on the heels of \\"Tombstone,\\" because it was awesome in it's own right. Production issues and the string of bad films for Costner aside, I found this film to be well made.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I went and saw \\"Rango\\" in the movie theatre. My podner :) and I loved it so much, I bought the Blu-Ray. We LOVE it. This is a movie for ADULTS who love SPAGHETTI WESTERNS. It's NOT for kids, none of the incredibly detailed critters are cute and fuzzy, they have eyes shot out,spit tabackky in their beards, have horrible teeth...your standard spaghetti western characters.   This movie is an homage to the \\"Good and Bad\\", no more, no less. Rango is clearly \\"the man with no name\\" the GOOD( and he, the GOD of all things good and western, makes a cameo, but I won't ruin it for ya-well ok I will, CLINT EASTWOOD ((without using C.E.))) and Rattlesnake Jake is \\"the BAD\\", same 'stache and hat as Lee van Cleef. Rango is on a search for who he is, and to write his story.    My other favorite thing about this movie is Los Lobos. The music, and their characters, are absolutly awesome in the traditional spaghetti mariachi music embrace of the genre. A++ to them!
B003L77FYS|5.0|5 stars for the series. I just can't get enough of CASTLE!. Have not begin to watch Season 3 yet. Just into Season 2. I was blown away by every episode. Still, is it me or have anyone noticed that the cover of Season 3, the picture of Beckett looks very much like the actress, Robin Tunney (Teresa Lisbon) in THE MENTALIST.
B004Z7AHZC|4.0|The kids love this movie, I've sat through it like 4 times already.  It is cute and there are some funny parts.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|It was an enjoyable book.  The photographs are beautiful.  I love how the story wraps around each image.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Well made camera holster that fits a standard size DSLR camera with a moderate telephoto lens attached.  It also has enough zippered pounches to carry your basic accessories.  Recommended.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|The story gripped me right away and I read (and ignored housework) until I finished. I adore the main character, Rose, and am happy that this character will continue on in future books. While the story is a mystery-it is full of small-town charm and is often hilarious.  I look forward to reading more from the author.
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Don't expect a masterpiece. It is not. But it is a good action film and you can enjoy it a lot provided you accept the clich&eacute;s that come with the genre.<br /><br />Of course the first agent shown as the victim of the monstrous communist North Koreans has to be the good one, even if it is a double or triple agent. In the same way the first American agent shown as snow white and crystal clear has to be a traitor and a double agent.<br /><br />So what is the difference of this film as compared to Bourne, Stallone and Terminator?<br /><br />The first element is that there are so many levels of secret agents that ignore one another that the Russians will inevitably lose. They have yet an easy task infiltrating the USA to the top, except the President of course; But this system at one moment has to fail, especially when they start taking hostage the people who are close to their agents and then killing these hostages in cold blood when the effect has been reached, or they think it has. Then the double secret agent has nothing left to lose.<br /><br />Infiltrating the USA is as easy as easy can be because they are a technological sewage or wasteland as for security and screening people and events. Even the procedure to start a nuclear war is so flimsy with confrontation of simple digital signals or alphanumerical codes via machines and nothing else is of course a farce.<br /><br />But good is always the victor in these films. The most positive element is that the main character is a woman, which will satisfy the transfer desires of girls and women in the audience to be able to identify with that demoniac agent impersonated by Angelina Jolie. That's a good change in the genre.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B0051QIGP4|3.0|I like Lady Gaga so I was excited for the new Cd. I am not that impressed with the CD but for $1 I can't complain!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|while there was nothing surprising about the plot, the storyline was still excellent and the movie was action-packed and very entertaining.
0553801473|3.0|This series may have been inspired by the Wars of the Roses, but readers now find themselves in the grim landscape of the Hundred Years War.<br /><br />I start with 5 stars for good writing, inventiveness, seriousness of theme and purpose and in  general what I would call truthfulness.  What I mean by that is that most of the more dire events throughout the entire series have been set in motion by the follies and failures of various of the characters.  For example,  the sequence of events which ended in the Red Wedding began with Caitlyn.  She presumed to insert herself into war and statecraft, persuits for which she had no training and less aptitude.  Possibly she did so out of a deep seated jealousy of the intriguer Cersei.  She failed in her duty to provide motherly comfort and support for her remaining son, provoking him into an unwise marriage, and then compounded that folly by seriously underestimating the vengefullness of the Freys.<br /><br />I take away one star for poor, as in, perhaps, nonexistent, editing. For this there can be no excuse.  This series has been lucrative for author and publisher alike.  The publisher could and should have afforded editing which might have excised some of the too often repeated phrases, maybe pointed out to Martin that Tyrion the Oversexed Dwarf does not make a good picaresque character.<br /><br />I take away another half star for what I think are structural flaws which have plagued the entire series.  Chief among these is the conceit of telling the story through the increasingly clumsy device of POV chapters.  I think so intricate a story could have been better told by straitforward narrative.  Another half star for borrowing a new plot device--the heir in exile--from another recent fantasy series, and doing so badly.  That leaves a three star rating.<br /><br />Martin's writing is far better than what is on offer from most of his contemporaries, and this book has its moments.  The two scenes between Lord Manderly and Davos, the King's Hand, were my favorites; also, the Prince of Dorne makes a welcome reappearance.  Please, let us have more of the Sand Snakes, some of the most delightfully wicked female characters to appear in popular literature for some time.  But, something is going seriously wrong when the minor characters steal the show from the major ones.  I have never been able to abide Tyrion the Oversexed, but as a strategist, he had some interest.  A picaresque hero he is not.  He has neither the humor nor the humanity for such a role.  Jon Snow is a good character whom Martin didn't seem to know what to do with. Take away Dany's clarity of thought and purpose, and you are left with another willful teenager.<br /><br />I am wondering to what extent Martin is being influenced by the producers of his HBO series, because some of the more unwelcome developments in the book, such as dumbded down Dany, are exactly what one would expect from the idiots in TVland. Do we now have a new heir because HBO needed a beefcake male lead??  Usually, they wait till a work of fiction is FINISHED before they ruin it.<br /><br />There is a work of greatness buried in this series.  Its' theme, IMHO, is justice. I think the theme explains the lenghthiness of the series.  These books are not, and, I would suggest, are not meant to be, adventure stories.  Martin shows us cities and provinces both well governed (White Harbor) and neglected and plundered (King's Landing)  He shows how seemingly small acts of selfishness or foolishness can have large, even dire, consequences.  The bleakness and misery depicted are what happens when there is no justice to be had.  Thugs, wicked lords and their retainers, blood soaked cults,<br />  and serial killers do flourish in a Randian universe.  And that home truth is one which many readers don't want to hear, so they complain a bout lengthy wait, or boring descriptions etc, etc.<br /><br />My suggestion to Mr. Martin would be a) just like George Lucas, he needs an editor, and b) he should tell the HBO vampires to take a hike.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this about a month ago and it has been excellent.  I had an old set of Hampton Bay knives we bought when my wife and I first got married.  They were exceptionally dull after a few years and using other sharpeners were a minimal success.  They only made the blade sharp enough for slicing up a salad and then it was too dull to slice a tomato.  After a few minutes on the whole set, the blades are razor sharp and it like it's a brand new set.  It is amazing.  All me hunting knives and my hatch have an amazing edge.  For something so cheap, but well made and valuable, this item is a steal. I'm buying all the hunters in my family this tool for their packs.
B004ULEEY8|2.0|This movie is a mashup of all of the worst cliches of war movies and alien invasion movies. I tried to sit through it, but just couldn't do it. The aliens have no advanced weaponry or technology, not even so much as advanced materials out of which to craft battle armor. They are easily dispatched with standard infantry rifles - didn't they bother to check out our capabilities before sending their troops in? Why did they land a bunch of individual soldiers to try to kill the humans one at a time instead of standing off in orbit and smashing our cities with megabombs? The paint-by-numbers \\"relationships\\" between the soldiers are laughable, the dialog beyond corny. We have the classic aliens-slaughtered-everyone-but-our-heroes plotline, complete with our-heroes-discover-how-to-defeat-aliens nonsense. Unless you actually enjoy having your intelligence profoundly insulted,Ten minutes of \\"DISTRICT 9\\" worth entire this JUNK! skip this one.C
0425242099|3.0|Kiss of Snow was a nice addition to the psy-changeling series. This is Hawke and Sienna's story. At first I thought I wouldn't be into it, because I am not a big fan of these two as a couple, but It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I still don't find them totally believable, but I wasn't cringing at every kiss and/or touch. I really enjoyed the secondary stories going on in the novel. Before I really hadn't had an opinion on Walker, he was always just kind of there, however, him and Lara.... I love them. They were such a good match and I have to wonder why they didn't get their own book, I'm not sure if this author is still continuing this series or if she is taking a break and that is why she had two couples mating along with the young ones pairing off as well. The only other thing I had a issue with was the whole deal with Sienna's power. I found it to be confusing. At times she is this ticking time bomb, yet at the same time she can control it and only hurt certain people? And I felt like her cure was too easily wrapped up with her and Hawke being a mated pair and Walker thrown in to the mix. It wasn't my favorite psy-changeling novel by far, but it was one of the better novels that have come out lately in the series. Out of 5 stars I give it 3.5.
B004KD5TQI|5.0|I really like this CD!!!!! Whoever said that all of the songs from the soundtrack aren't on the movie is TOTALLY wrong because every single song from the movie IS included on the CD Some of my favorite songs are: \\"Sweet Dreams\\" (Are Made Of This)\\" by Emily Browning, \\"Army Of Me\\" (Sucker Punch Remix) \\"White Rabbit\\" and a few other songs but overall this is a great CD with an great mix of rock/pop music and If you enjoyed watching the movie then you'll definitely like the soundtrack!!!!! I would highly recommend it!!!!!
1451629184|5.0|As with many others, I read this book in one sitting, knowing I couldn't leave Jaycee's words for a moment.  Her voice comes through on every page -- honest and without pretense.  She speaks in a simple and straightforward way that hits you right in the gut.  She's an amazing and inspiring person and it felt like an honor to be reading her story in her own words.
0743289692|5.0|Infidel now means hero. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is living proof that sometimes you have to lose absolutely everything in order to find yourself.<br /><br />Her story begins with the final moments of free speech martyr Theo Van Gogh - the Dutch filmmaker who was brutally murdered in the Netherlands for having made a film criticizing Islam. His Muslim killer shot him several times in broad daylight, his throat slit and a 5 page letter stabbed into his back. \\"That letter was addressed to me,\\" begins Ayaan Hirsi Ali in Infidel.<br /><br />She was the impetus and writer of Van Gogh's short film, \\"submission\\", criticizing the oppression of Muslim women. She now lives with bodyguards in safehouses, but Ali grew up a Muslim in Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya - firmly believing in Allah, often abused, learning multiple languages and all about her \\"clan\\". She and her sister endured female circumsion when a man came to their house and as their clan held them down, he mercilessly snipped off their clitorises with scissors.<br /><br />The excision results in a scar that covers the vagina so thoroughly that there's barely room to leak out urine. Girls who could be heard urinating a full stream were mercilessly made fun of - as clearly they had not been genitally mutilated and thus were unclean. It also meant that sex was a painful experience and the new husband, post-wedding, having thrust and penetrated through this scar, would run around to show the family his pride: the blood-soaked sheets.<br /><br />Unlike many, Ali was given an education and occasionally got her hands on Western books that spoke about sexual and intellectual liberation. Not that she ever dared at all in the way of insubordination. After all, \\"submission\\" is the very definition of Islam. Her father was a rebel leader attempting to free Somalia (still hopeless!) and her mother a woman who learned to accept her lot and constantly blamed others for her unhappiness. When her father arranged a marriage to a devout Muslim from Canada, she uncharacteristically tried to reason her father out of it.<br /><br />Then, on her way to Canada to consummate the marriage to this man she had met once for 15 minutes, she had a layover in Germany and something sparked. She walked out the door, took a train to the Netherlands, registered as a refugee and disappeared. Somehow she summoned a courage she was never taught.<br /><br />Infidel is a riveting journey of awakening, nothing short of a woman's total renaissance. An escape to home that is hope and inspiration for humankind. We don't have to be afraid of the dark.<br /><br />Of course, her \\"husband\\" and her clan chased her down, but by now she was strong enough to resist their wrath and say yes to freedom. She even got her sister Haweya refugee status in Holland but she did not fare as well. Haweya said it was like being locked up in a house and suddenly the walls fall down and you are confronted with so many options you simply become paralyzed. She floundered, refused to assimilate, retreated into Islam, raced back to Kenya, went mad and died.<br /><br />But Ali was empowered, ignited by the flame we call purpose. She learned the language, studied political science, and was elected to Dutch parliament where she spoke out about the dangers of Holland's tolerance of new immigrants who still practice customs like female genital mutilation and honor killings. Ayaan Hirsi Ali became wholly apostate after 9/11.<br /><br />Ironically, it is in finding purpose that the struggle truly begins.stically tried to reason her father out of it.

0743289692|5.0|I always struggle with the balance between understanding and accepting people's differences, and fighting for what I believe to be `right'. Ayaan Hirsi Ali's story sheds great light on this balance. She grew up as a strict Muslim with rigid beliefs, believing this was the path to God and goodness. Her eventual rejection of Islam emerged through direct experience of an alternate way of life. It started with reading works of literature and romance novels while still in Africa, to experiencing  compassion and freedom in the Netherlands. Something inside of her realized that this was how she wanted to live her life; this was a better life for her, and perhaps a better life for everyone. It was not easy however. Once a person is God-fearing, the fear of defying God is extremely difficult to overcome, as shown by Ayaan's constant struggle to push her anti-Muslim thoughts to the back of her mind. In the words of Martin Luther King, \\"Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.\\" The first step to creating change in the world is understanding why people are the way they are and exhibiting compassion towards them. Aayan clearly mastered this.    I appreciated Ayaan's approach to writing this book. She saves her commentary and opinions for the last few chapters.  Her story is bare and unflinching, and allows you to react to it in your own way and draw your own conclusions.
B00529J7JE|5.0|Ok so I have to be honest: with the exception of \\"Blue Bayou\\", I've never heard any of the original versions of the songs featured on this album. But I do know that after hearing Andrea's versions, it makes me curious to hear the originals and compare, even though I know I will be biased towards Andrea's. I just love her voice and I really don't care what she sings, just as long as she does! Songs from this album that stand out for me are: \\"Tinseltown In The Rain\\", \\"State Of Independence\\", \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\". If you're an Andrea Corr fan, definitely listen to this! If you're a Corrs fan, well, you might be disappointed because this is just Andrea's voice/song covers, so it's definitely not gonna sound like the whole group since, as Andrea has said in the past, it took 4 people to make that sound.    Can't wait for her next album!

B0037RDPEG|1.0|All the hype and good reviews may have set my expectations too high, but this is the worst book I've ever read. I slogged through it trying to find what others said had \\"changed their lives\\". It was boring beyond belief; and I particularly hated the pretence of being honest.
0553801473|2.0|I am not sure if Martin has simply lost interest in this project, has become distracted, or simply been overwhelmed...Or if editors have helped or hindered him. Though, I think it is telling that one of his editors admits he's left a book's worth of material on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />The book somehow manages to feel both too meandering and too rushed at the same time. And I can't help but feel that some of his experience in writing scripts for the HBO series has rubbed off on how he writes the books. In fact, I'm certain of it.<br /><br />If so, we're all the poorer for it.<br /><br />I can't imagine events being wrapped up in two books, given what he chose to spend so much time on in this one...and we'll have to wait ten years to find out.<br /><br />Martin was probably a bit too cruelly gratuitous in his cliffhangers. Reading this book might be a much different experience as part of a completed series, but taken alone, is painful, and not as re-readable as the first 3 books.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|I have a hard time reviewing \\"Soul Surfer\\" because I liked the movie a lot (five stars) but I squirmed in my seat a little when the Christian stuff came up.  If the heroine had been a devout Hindu or Buddhist or even Muslim I don't think the religious content would have bothered me.  But hyping Christianity makes me want to duck and hide.  I know this is a personal problem.  It has to do with politics rather than religion.  In the U.S. fundamentalist Christianity is connected to the Tea Party movement, which I absolutely abhor (I'm convinced Jesus would too).  In a nut shell, I really liked the fact that the movie had great actors, no profanity or toilet humor, a great message of acceptance and inclusion, wonderful characters.  And I didn't even know I personally had a problem with Christian content until I saw the movie.  And I hate myself for being so narrow minded.  As far as I know, in real life the heroine and her family are very religious and the movie got it just right.  I'm going to work on keeping politics out of how I view entertainment, or religion for that matter.
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|Bought to pass time on way to San Francisco and absolutely loved it.  What a performance - goosebumps stuff.
B00138KGOS|5.0|this album is good. its got some great songs, some i like a lot, and a few that i have deleted. it's definitely not the joke that many claim it to be. If you cut the weak songs it is just as good as nashville skyline, and in the same style. and it's way better than most of new morning. I suspect that what upset many of the critics was the fact that it doesn't have a lot of the surreal lyrics that a youthful bob entranced them with. Here it's mainly bob singing straight forward songs in a country style, which he does beautifully. I have no idea why his version of the boxer is considered to be some form of parody. i also like the cover painting, but i am shocked that bob gets so much money for his paintings, which are pretty amateurish. i love this record
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard tells her story in her own words, in her own way.  You actually see the monster and his actions through the eyes of an eleven year old.  But what makes this book five stars in my book is that through it all, Jaycee doesn't just survive--she grows into an intelligent, insightful, and caring young woman, in spite of the horror she had to live in. She made me realize just how many things we have and take for granted, and that our priorities become clear in adversity. I couldn't stop reading once I started. I wanted to know more about her therapy and life when it was over. Hopefully, she will write a sequel one of these days.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Really, this has been reviewed to death, but Firefly was by far my favorite TV show of all time. Sadly, a fifteen episode run and one movie didnt really do it any justice. The blue-ray however, along with all the extra features, such as the interviews and the like do in fact do the series justice and are a must own for any fan.
0790744295|5.0|This movie was one that started the whole Crypt Keeper fad. You can't be a true horror fan and not own these movies. I was so excited to get my copy!
B004R63MWQ|3.0|This was really an average effort IMO. The idea of Tron is cool, and some of the CG effects were very impressive. Really though, the story itself was pretty average. That, and the main antagonist, who is supposed to be lacking in emotion actually has quite a bit of it in a wooden way. Kind of a glaring story flaw. Overall, it is just like watching somebody playing a video game with just a bit too much emphasis on a shaky plot.<br />It wasnt horrible, but really wasnt special. Worth a rental, but no chance i would ever buy the discs (no pun intended).
B0058VW36U|5.0|The game play is fantastic, addictive and fun. The sound effects are infectious.. Music was fine, but I play without music in most games. The critter is adorable, and really draws you into the game. The levels were varied and interesting, as were the mechanics. My complaints are that the game was too short. I was able to three star all levels in a few days of casual play. There were four or five levels I would call challenging, likely do to my solution.. But there needed to be more challenging levels. Excellent game, more fun than angry birds (which I like), absolutely worth a buck.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|Good:<br />1. quick GPS reception. better GPS accuracy than my Garmin Forerunner 110.<br />2. tons of functions.<br /><br />Bad:<br />1. it is a typical product designed by a bunch of engineers. a great product in concept but not very well executed.<br />2. not very intuitive to use.<br />3. battery counter is not very reliable. (better with firmware update). Not sure if there is a way to stop this thing to save energy. Have to plug to the power cord all the time.<br />4. the bezel does not work well when wet. Have you ever got wet while running????<br />5. pretty heavy.<br />6. light stops working after a year of use. i have rarely used the light function.
B0034G4P8K|2.0|What's a lot: Action, for one. About the first third of the movie sets the scene, then the remainder runs full tilt down to the end. Buildings collapse, robots battle in elegantly choreographed mayhem, and bloodless violence abounds. (Robots give and receive almost all of it, so even limb amputations drip a little hydraulic fluid at worst.) Animation also stands out. It wasn't that many years ago when [[ASIN:B0024FADAQ The Last Starfighter]] blew the top off the computed imagery of its day. That technological wonder look almost Amish by \\"Transformer\\" standards. Not only are the animated junkyards vastly more complex as simple images, their articulation and movement reach levels of visual credibility that just weren't possible even a few years ago.<br /><br />What's a little: Plot, character, dialog - you know, everything other than eye candy. The robots speak like the Silver Surfer reading Shakespeare ([[ASIN:0764585681 Cliff Notes]], not the original). The autocratic control freak in charge of national security never even tries to rise above two-dimensionality. Teleporting a whole planet arm's reach away from Earth -  well, even if you ignore the whole teleporting thing, the physics just don't add up. (Roche limit, anyone?) Then there's Carly with her high heels in a combat zone. I think that phrase says everything.<br /><br />Great for tweens enamored of their action figures, and for computer graphics propellor-heads who don't read the research journals (and for some who do). OK if you need an air-conditioned space on a summer day and want to see property values drop faster than collateralized debt obligations. Otherwise missable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B004LWZW24|3.0|To sum up my reaction after watching this film in one word would be \\"eh.\\"  Insidious carries on its title \\"Scariest movie since the Exorcist.\\"  Keeping in mind that the critic(if one would call them that) came from Access Hollywood i wasn't completely sold.  Having seen my fair share of horror movies I can rank Insidious in the cliche ridden pile of shocker horror films that Hollywood has been churning out every year.   No new ground is uncovered in Insidious.  It takes the haunted house motif of horror movies from the 70's like The Amiyitville Horror, adds a a dash of the Exorcist with a peppering of of Poltergeist and voila you have just made Insidious.    The beginning starts out convincing enough with a bright young family buying a new house and hopes of starting a future.  The father played by Patrick Wilson is a teacher.  A teacher of what we never find out, but in the initial first scenes we learn that his past is somewhat mysterious.  Rose Byrne who plays the mother in the film seems to enjoy playing the piano while looking after her three kids.  Besides the look of sadness that pervades her every move, she spends most of the film either in tears or imploring her husband of the impending doom that is running rampant in the house.    Cliches riddle the tingling plot from the husband who doesn't believe the house is haunted to the crazy grandmother who hires exorcists to get rid of the demon lodged in her grandson.    High expectations may have ruined the film for me.  Looking for something fresh and exciting in the horror genre i was left disappointed and only mildly chilled.  Half way through the director seemed to inject a bit of humor into the film with the appearance of the three exorcist experts.  A chance to lighten the mood just turned into a desperate attempt of high camp comedy.    All in all Insidious is middle of the pack horror at its best.  It's high ambitions were trumped by cliche and tired acting from the people involved.  Insidious makes fora good rental on a Saturday night with nothing else to do!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Like many others, I have been waiting for this book a long time. And it was okay.  I think it's an improvement over feast, but not a very big one.<br /><br />The return of the narrative to the North is a welcome one and developments at the Wall and beyond have always been central to my interest in this series.  The best chapters (Theon, Bran, Jon, Asha & Davos) all are focused there and that is where the story flows and feels like the first three entries in the series BUT...<br /><br />when the focus turns to Essos in the East it floundered. Dany has never been my favorite character, but I have felt her tale has tightened and grown more interesting with each new book. No more. Her character development went backward in a bad way.<br /><br />That was bad, but Tyrion's tale was worse. Imagine, if you will, a travelogue of Belgium randomly inserted into your favorite sitcom... no matter how well it's been done it won't fit and will irritate. That was how I felt during Tyrion's story.<br /><br />To put it plainly: I care about Westeros and the calamity coming from the far side of the Wall.  Too much of the story diverged and lingered on other places.  It felt very unfocused and ultimately uninteresting. I'm desperate for some resolution here and Martin does not appear to be at all interested in providing any, which is a shame.
B000FA57N0|5.0|Ranks IMHO with top SciFi titles of all time (Aliens, Bladerunner) Diverse cast, classic struggle against THE MAN and other monsters.
B000002U8G|5.0|Fantastic album for lovers of rock, blues, experimental music or Pink Floyd. If you already own it, I recommend checking out \\"Live at Pompeii - Director's Cut\\" for video footage. About the song \\"Echoes,\\" I haven't seen a better comment than this one:      \\"Absolutely love this song--especially the eerie keyboards right in the middle. I hope when I die or I'm near death, this song is playing nearby--what an awesome last thing to hear...\\" -- Anonymus from an internet forum.
B000RJO58M|4.0|Unique take on cop buddy movie format. Loved the directing style.  Very gory in some parts.  Brilliant casting.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|After Liar's Poker which brought out the excessive, the extreme, the corruption I couldn't wait to get my hands on this one!  In his witty and intelligent manner, Michael doesn't disappoint here.  A great follow up would be \\"Inside Job\\" narrated by Matt Damon.  It would seem after studying the markets, the participants, the winners and the losers, the game is obviously rigged and only the casino makes $$$. In the odds that a major player wipes out the casino, they have a free hedge by the US taxpayer.  This crisis has brought the world to it's knees which I belive is still somewhat in it's infancy is simply a transfer of wealth.  Like energy, which is neither created nor destroyed, $$$ simply changes hands,  12 years ago, the wealth of the world was primarily in the top 10%. Now, only 12 years later, that number is 1%.  99% of the worlds wealth has been transferred ot the top 1% of the population.   This is a 1000% increase in 12 years!!!  The Illuminati and the secret societies have become very real truths, previously ignored.  What is next? Who knows? I guess we'll find out...
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Actor's performance, direction and art direction was exceptional.  Story line is a bizarre attempt to combine martial arts, video gaming, and music videos that left me with a jaw agape for much of the movie.  Seems to target 16 year old boys as an audience.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I just can't believe that after OK Computer and The Bends they could come up with something better. Yeah it's that good. This is just simply Radiohead's best work. There is not one bad song in this!  15 Step (10/10) - This track is just fantastic. It's maybe the best intro song on a Radiohead album. The drum'n'bass style is just awesome.  Bodysnatchers (9.5/10) - Yes, a ROCK song, with GUITARS!!! This is Radiohead coming back to their roots.  Nude (10/10) - A beautiful song, very mellow, with one of the most beautiful endings I've ever listened to.  Weird Fishes / Arpeggi (10/10) - In my opinion, the best track in the album. This one is one of the most beautiful songs by Radiohead.  All I Need (9/10) - Starts slowly and buids up until a great ending. Beautiful.  Faust Arp (9/10) - Beautiful violins and guitar. Also great lyrics.  Reckoner (10/10) - Beautiful cymbal solos and melody. One of the best tracks in the album, truly beautiful.  House Of Cards (10/10) - Very beautiful lyrics and melody. It has a very nice ambient feel, with echoing vocals.  Jigsaw Falling Into Place (10/10) - Another Rock song!!! Great melody and vocals. Second best track in the album, in my opinion.  Videotape (10/10) - The perfect ending, lead by piano. The drums also play a vital part, giving a hypnotic feel to it.  Here it is, the best album by Radiohead!  If you are getting introduced to Radiohead, In Rainbows is the perfect start. This is a truly great album by truly great musicians.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|If you want to watch a movie where a hot girl wearing kinky clothes randomly fighting \\"FORCES OF EVIL\\" then you will love this movie.  But, if you actually want a movie with substance and a point or a plot I would strongly avoid this film.  The entire time watching this movie I was like what is going on!  Where's the plot, where's the story line?  It was just a huge choppy mess and reality was nowhere in sight.      This is the movie... Orphan sent to mental institution for accidentally killing her sister while attempting to protect her from their bad daddy. Then the movie transforms from a mental institution (in her mind) to a whore house and THEN transforms again to fighting EVIL every-time she had to strip for the men, which means she's being sexually abused by the guy that runs the mental institution (rapist).  When she finally defeats the forces of evil she gets lobotomized with a metal rod through her eye socket and the force of evil (the rapist) can no longer manipulate her... the end.    If you we're lost during my explanation, or think that I missed something, or are pissed off because it makes no sense.  Get over it, because I just saved you money and time for wasting it on this movie.
B004NSULHM|2.0|To begin with, I'm a die-hard Radiohead fan, but all I can say is:  This is sad. After the long wait since In Rainbows, we have an album with eight songs: this is the longest wait between two Radiohead albums and it's the shortest album of theirs.  I mean, in my opinion, In Rainbows is their best album. Not OK Computer nor Kid A. In Rainbows. Every song in this album is just great. Now... how the hell can this \\"album\\" follow such a beautiful work as In Rainbows?  Well, I don't know. The King of Limbs is just one of the worst albums I've listened in my whole life. This one is all about poor drum loops and strange noises, like blips and electronic bird singing. Even Thom Yorke isn't singing, he just moans all the time! I just didn't expect this after the brilliant In Rainbows... it's a shame.  I just wish they stop playing with their laptops and create more real music, like they used to.  Now, to all you die-hard fans saying I should stop thinking about another OKC or The Bends, I do not expect them to create another album like this. But I really didn't expect another Kid A. And where Kid A was interesting, this one is just annoying.  Let's hope for a better next album.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Even through all of the terrible things this woman endured growing up with the Garrido's, she has grown into a better, more compassionate person than most people in the world. (Especially better than the ones on here criticizing her writings)  When I think back to when I was in the 5th grade and how innocent I was then, I cannot imagine the horror that little girl felt with all he put her through. Even a grown woman couldn't deal with that and come out of it sane.   How wonderful is it that Jaycee is strong enough to have the courage to write about all that happened in that 18 years?  Even as young as she was, she was smart enough to know that these people were crazy and was always more intelligent than her captors.  They may have had complete control over her physically, but they were not able to control her thoughts, feelings and the love she held on to for her Mother. That says so much about the bond between a mother and child!    Jaycee, you hang in there baby, you've got your whole life ahead of you. It may not always be easy, but just always remember that it is a hell of allot better than where you've been. I for one am so proud of you for making it out of there with your sanity and a wonderful heart full of love. I admire you for your strength and determination to survive against all odds!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I read this book in less than a day. I kept picturing my 13yr old daughter, the emotions just grow that much more. I recommend this book 100%. My heart goes out to Jaycee and her family. God bless them and their ongoing healing.
1932100660|5.0|This book is very easy to read. It is a must read for everyone concerned about our food and our planet. It explains what is happening to people without their consent or knowledge ! Buy this for everyone you love and care about !! I can't stress that enough!  My husband and I are very concerned for our ongoing health, and this book gives you the knowledge you need to learn how to protect yourselves with the food that we choose to eat.  Don't wait any longer, order your copy today! It will change your life forever.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry birds do more than fly, they ROCK!  Yet another great game from Rovio.  Addictive, fun, and challenging. A must play game!
B0051BNXXO|5.0|If a book inspires you to turn your business mobile and take your office with you to virtually any corner of the world, what more can you ask? For me, it did just that.     Unorthodox? Yes.   Possible to everybody? No.   Worth reading? Absolutely.
B001675YQ6|5.0|I was just looking for something to play on the background while finishing some work on my computer and had the luck to find this movie, and in two minutes I was just enjoying it and forgetting all that I had to do. Totally refreshing, light and funny, perfect to end a stressing day.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|The cast and characters really shined in this romantic comedy.  They were all funny and I enjoyed every minute of this smartly written and well acted movie.  I watched it twice in one day and you have to watch the 'behind the scenes extras with the director and producer'; it made me appreciate the movie and the cast even more.      Ashton Kutcher is so sexy and funny, how could you beat that?  Natalie Portman plays a smart and sassy doctor.  Kevin Kline is hilarious, as expected.  The entire cast was very carefully and well chosen.  It's witty, sly, and silly humor, not 3 stooges.  I love that they didn't once rely on 'misunderstandings' and all of the scenes were unpredictable, not the same old tired plot.  I loved this movie.
B0055OK2T0|2.0|Not a bad movie, but not particularly good either. No climax really. It's so Hollywood-tsy, yet so boring at moments. Was probably inspired by the premise behind Fringe - the \\"angels\\" wear the same hats as the observers in Fringe, they constantly \\"observe\\", etc. Unlike Fringe though this movie was too artificial and shallow, and failed to make me believe and identify with the characters. In Fringe love is used as the differentiator, the force that saves humanity, here... meh. Then it has also borrowed stuff from the Matrix - the door-opening to access various route shortcuts, etc. In the end though, it's just that - a sack of borrowed ideas and \\"moments\\", which were so badly mish-mashed, nothing really meaningful came out, sorry.
0937381888|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. Look like it was very informative and a very good book for someone who wants to learn the process of brewing beer.
0553801473|3.0|If I wasn't bored enough after reading AFFC, which droned on for hundreds of pages about characters I couldn't care less about, I just hit the end of the boredom spectrum. Rarely am I so uninterested after finishing a story I have waited years to chance upon but this one did it. The story made advancements sure, albeit at a snails pace and sure we got to see some new character developments, most of which could have been left untold in lieu of a better story. One can only hope that his next book doesn't disappoint as much... and hopefully comes out in a timely manner, unlike this monstrosity, which leaves me with the feeling that I wasted 3 days of my life reading. Read the prologue and call it a day, that's pretty much the only thing worth a damn that came from this book. As much as I wanted to, I couldn't in good conscious give this less than a 3, but this was definitely not one to phone home about.
B0031Q0XCA|1.0|I mean, wow. I've enjoyed some terrible stuff, but this was just too much. I usually enjoy Jordan Gosef Levinson, but I think Katie Perry is awful. She's a much better singer.     Three glasses of wine in, I still didn't understand it... why was I watching this trash? I'd watch Van Helsing again, but maybe in French, so it'll be artsy.
B0002S947K|4.0|Excellent CD. Grab it and let it grab you. Ray LaMontagna has an excellent voice and cadence and writes memorably. His voice has been compared to many of the all-time greats like Van Morrison but I find him to be rather unique. Soulful and ranging with a gravely voice, his compositions on this 2006 work vary although each is skillfully executed.
0439023513|2.0|I don't know what to say to folks reading this other than \\"lower your expectations.\\" If you've read the first two books (as I'd assume you had if you're picking up the third) you've been introduced to well written characters and engaging story-lines. In the third you have a taste that more may come only to be forced to wrestle through congested plots and expedient situations that produce chaotic conclusions.    I felt that through the latter half of the book Ms. Collins must have been rushed or coerced to finish the book (perhaps both). It pains me to write a review like this because I and my family truly admire her work; her books have a special place on our shelves along with the likes of C. S. Lewis, Lois Lowry, Katherine Paterson, Madeleine L'Engle  and E. B. White. But even great writers can have a bad outing and to me this is. I met few who've read it that believe that this concluded the series well and too many that were dismayed.    Lower your expectations and this book may surpass them. It's still a visit into the lives of some great characters/cultures - just not as good as it could have been.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|This movie will always be one of the best HP movies. But I have to admit, the Deathly Hallows (1&2) is better.
1600241824|4.0|I have never laughed so hard in my life than when I listened to this.  Seriously, whenever I'm having a bad day or I know something stressful is coming up, I listen to these essays. Sedaris takes weird stuff that happens in life and turns them into hilarious and insightful pieces that entertain and give a whole new look at the absurd situations life frequently contains.<br /><br />It's hard to give a long review of this, because they're composed of non-fiction essays, so there isn't really a long plot line to critique or character development to discuss. I will just say that this collection will have you laughing out loud and will make you look differently at weird situations that arise in your own life.<br /><br />I also highly recommend the audiobook version of this. Hearing the essays read in Sedaris's own voice with his intonations really sets the tone and adds to the comedy.
0971407614|4.0|I would have given this book 5 stars if it were not for the misinformation/myth in Chapter 4 \\"why Strength Training? (or Why Cardio is a Waste of Your time)\\"  I've trained for years as a competitive runner from 5k to the marathon.  My training has always incorporated strength training.  When running, and depending on how long your training session is, your body burns off calories in the following order: sugars, carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.  Your body burns off proteins LAST after the other sources have been exhausted!  To get to that point, you will have had to run a very long distance (marathon or ultra distances).  Did you ever wonder why overweight people who run for fifteen minutes a day never lose weight?  It's because they did not run long enough to burn off the fat; they burned off the sugars first and then some of the carbs, but did not run long enough to burn the fat!  The same principle applies to protein, you must run a certain amount of time before your body starts burning off protein.  Using protein for energy is the most ineffient of the four sources of energy because it causes dehydration (water is lost in the process).  This is why the body resorts to protein as a source of energy LAST.  What WILL cause muscle atrophy is a carb and/or protein deficiency in your diet.  If you are eating a lot of carbs and proteins daily, then you will not have to worry about muscle loss during running.  Don't believe the myth in Chapter 4.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|After seeing the first 7 movies and constant badgering by my ex girlfriend, I finally caved and read all the books before DH2 came out. I loved all the books, LOVED them. DH1 had so much emotion that you felt for the characters even if you had not read the books. My expectations were raised so highly for this film, especialy considering all the praise it had garnered. I saw it Saturday night and boy was it NOT what i expected. Storytelling is great but with this much buildup, you also need EMOTION. I wasn't able to connect to the characters as i was in DH1. Scenes were cut short that were near epic in the book. I consider myself disappointed that this is how it all ends. It's a shame.
0553801473|2.0|Some good plot points are thrown in in random places in the books, but for the most part it's just wading through useless paragraphs and chapters to find little nuggets of interesting plot development. Then at the end of all that wading, you are still left without any resolution to the vague story lines that are the central part of the book. There's very little advancement to the plot and the majority of the plot points left unresolved in the last two books are still dangling. A good editor could have easily combined this book and the last in about 500 pages and still have room for the plot resolutions that should have taken place but didn't. At this point in the story it would have been very easy to make a list of things that needed to happen by the end of this book, write those pieces, and add the filler around it. Instead we have lots and lots of filler, and little storyline. I'm done with this series.
0553801473|1.0|A lot of people waited a long time for this book.  When it finally arrived, and was as long as it was, I expected something to happen.  Very little did.  It drags, big time.  Now the wait for the next installment, which may never happen.

1853287512|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1F77N5HLT7CSK]]<br />THE BASICS OF BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LEXCEL version 4 STANDARD - WITH ACCOMPANYING CD ROM<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Robson Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers, Richmond, Surrey<br />Be it fire, flood, IT breakdown, negligence or crime, any emergency that overtakes your law practice can be expensive.  Yes, you will have insurance. But you may still lose considerably in terms of those all-important fee-earning hours while things are put right.<br /><br />The sensible way forward for any practice is to implement a continuing programme of business continuity planning (BCP).  The concept began with the increasing importance of and dependence upon IT systems and broadened into contingency planning for management and staff problems, the people element being vital to the success of any business.<br /><br />If you need any examples, just check out the case studies in this excellent Lexcel `toolkit' from the Law Society.  Don't worry; they're very brief, these anecdotes, but chillingly illustrative.  Although anonymous, they all relate situations which actually happened to law firms or organisations within the legal sector.  Each is followed by a `learning point' which we would be tempted to call `the moral of the story.'<br /><br />Business Continuity Planning therefore is part of any well observed and administered risk management programme - and implementing such a programme is made much easier for your practice with this succinct paperback volume and its accompanying CD as your guide.  It's designed to help you identify and manage areas of risk.  Most importantly it helps you comply with the Lexcel version 4.1 Standard (Section 2.3)<br /><br />Like the other wildly popular Lexcel Toolkits, the book and CD ROM together pack in a wealth of information and resources in a compact and concise format.

B003UESJHO|3.0|I was caught up in the film as the conclusion approached. It built up to the BIG FIGHT as (almost) all fight movies do. Of course, I'm not going to tell you how it ends; about the only reason I watched the whole film was because I did not know the ending.    But as the credits rolled and I began to think about writing this review it occurred to me that this film is just too \\"cluttered.\\" That is, there are too many elements coming together. I know it's based upon a true story, but even excellent documentaries try to streamline.  The people who made this film, however, tried to cover \\"all the bases\\" (mixed metaphor), and the film lost its effectiveness, as far as I'm concerned. There's the domineering mother, the girlfriend that the family won't accept, the eccentric (but adorable) family, the older sibling who missed his big chance, the failing boxer furiously training for glory, and the hometown hero. Was there a \\"plain\\" woman who falls for the pugilist? What about crack addiction? How about a mobster who has his claws sunk into the hero? Is there a \\"movie within a movie\\" element?  You'll have to watch it and see.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|The best word to describe this fourth album by Beyonce is enigma. At one moment you are completely depressed, the next minute you are feeling mellow, and the last your ready to run the world. This album is composed with a blended mixture of 80s,90s,00s R&B with added ingredients of modern pop and dance club tunes. This is not an album that will instantly grab you in order to appreciate this album you are going to have to listen to it at least 4 times before you start liking the songs. I believe a strong reason why the album took time to sink in is because the arrangement of the songs started with ballads rather than a strong upbeat song so you are practically depressed until you hear the number five song\\"Party\\" where the album becomes more upbeat. Alas this is my review of each song on the album:   Best Songs of the Album  1+1 = The best ballad of the album hands down  Party = The best beat of the album I feel like partying after hearing the song  Countdown = Modern R&B with a vocal twist  End of Time= You feel like going back to Africa  I was Here= An inspirational song for people who are trying to find out what they want to do in life  Run the World= Girls we gotta run this world    Okay Songs  I Miss U= Nice Beat but depressing  Best Thing I never Had= I think of late 80s Pop with this one  Rather Die Young= Starts of really weird then it goes to R&B  Start Over= Nice  Love On Top= Very 80s R&B    Songs that should have been left out of the album  I care= Did not care for this song    Although predominately R&B there were some songs that definitely were not. But arguably this is the best Beyonce vocal album period. Her vocals in this album were outstanding and better than all of her previous albums and I believe this is the point that the artist is trying to convey. Anyone can perform a club song but how many songs can artists sing live but most importantly with emotion? How many artists of todays musical genre can even reach alto or sorprano notes? None. And that is why Beyonce switched the game. Beyonce went back to her roots and wanted to reinforce the R&B that she grew up with where your vocals and performing made you an artist not if you can do a Michael Jackson move or by cutting your hair short attempting to be unique.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I enjoyed the book a very good read. Bought it at Sam's Club for about $6. The Kindle edition was just too expensive.
0553801473|3.0|First of all, where Geo. R.R. is concerned, I've been a waiter, not a hater.  However, there are some writers whose work would benefit greatly if their computers were taken away from them and they were forced to go back to using typewriters.  The ease with which changes can be made using word processing software leads, in certain bestselling authors, to bloated books and inert plots because no one can or will edit them any more.  If George R. R. Martin had to retype all of Dance over again every time he changed something, it would have been a much more concise and compelling book.<br /><br />My love of the first three books carried me through A Feast For Crows and A Dance With Dragons.  While actually reading, Mr. Martin's prose and style were more than enough to engross me; it was only afterward that I realized that for all the action, the fighting, the sex and the snow, this book was like a swarming anthill: Plenty of activity, but it never actually went very far, and where it did go wasn't necessarily good.  Jon Snow clashes with Stannis in the North while winter  takes hold, and Daenerys learns that ruling is harder than it seemed, while things get even worse for Tyrion--Nearly every POV character from the first four books had one or several chapters in this book, with a few new POVs for good measure. One of those POVs introduces a new character--.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil anything, so I will try and write around it.  The concept of Chekov's Gun (the playwright, not the Star Trek character) is this: if you show a gun on stage in Act One, it has to go off in Act Three.  There should be a corollary that says: if you're going to have a gun go off in Act Three, you have to show it, or at least refer to it, in Act One.  This character is dropped into the story in Book Five without any foreshadowing in a way which smacks of daytime soap operas and leads me to suspect the author is desperately trying to revive his own interest in continuing the series.  Sadly,since this character has been added, he/she/it is now canon and can't be redacted.<br /><br />I had wondered why Mr. Martin, who began by writing fanfiction, is now so strongly against it.  Dance makes that unfortunately clear.  Ninety-nine percent and more of fanfic is dreck, full of syrupy Mary-Sues, deficient in grammar and spelling, filled with wildly improbable (and horribly written) same-sex character pairings--but those responsible for the fraction that remains would be capable of writing a sequel with more spirit, forward drive and plot development than this book shows.<br /><br />I fear ASOIAF is like a ship becalmed at sea, lost in the doldrums, badly needing fresh wind for its sails.
B000003C5C|5.0|Back a summer ago, I began exploring more outside my favorite genre of metal thrash to some old-school death metal styles. Before that, I had tried to get into it, but nothing really clicked with me, in particular the vocal styles. So one day, out of impulse I listened to some songs off Death's Leprosy. To my surprise, the album had a very raw, thrashy sound to it but with some different vocal styles of course. I decided to get the album just for something new, and boy what a great decision that was. This album and Death opened me up to Death Metal, and since then Death has become one of my favorite bands and Chuck has been a great influence on me as a musician(R.I.P.). This album is Death's second album and keeps almost the same vibe as their debut Scream Bloody Gore. This is still Death's early brutal, gorefest galore era, and this album is the best representation of that era. The songs on here are very memorable unlike some on 'Scream', and the production is a little better and more crisp on here. After this album Chuck would begin expanding the Death sound to higher and higher levels which is why I love this band so much. So if you're out on a limb about the Death metal genre, try Death and see how much more Death metal is than meets the eye.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|In order for the Harry Potter movies to be regarded as a triumph of film-making it was essential that the final movie should be not only a satisfying conclusion, but the best film of the entire series. Happily, it is. This was the movie they got right.  David Yates moves the film along at just the right pace; the action is practically non-stop, but not so frantic that there isn't time to take in what is happening. Steve Kloves provides the best script yet, retaining most of the essence of the book while upping the humor and the dramatic tension of the finale. The acting, especially by the three principals, is the best of any of the movies and although there are relatively few newcomers (Aberforth and the Grey Lady are the only substantial introductions) the stalwarts produce their best work in this film.  There were a couple of things I really appreciated. The deaths, though not glossed over, were indicated subtly rather than in a gruesome manner. Those of the supporters of Harry were really not shown at all, which I thought was well-considered and made this movie much less sombre than might otherwise have been the case; and the deaths of those on the dark side were either off-camera or done in a surreal fashion. That makes this movie much more acceptable for younger viewers (and for this older viewer) than if everything had been shown in gory detail. In addition, the disposal of the final horcrux was done extremely well- in fact, to my mind, rather better than in the book, which relied on a somewhat far-fetched coincidence. Congratulations to those who came up with these ideas and also to J.K. Rowling for accepting them.  There was one part I thought was missed and that was 'the gleam in Dumbledore's eye', which occurred in Book 4 and was the single most speculated-about phrase in the whole series until it was explained in Book 7. Here it is simply omitted, which leaves a gap in the logic of Harry's relationship with Voldemort and its consequences. However, that'sa minor matter and those of us who know the books understand why things happened the way they did.  The special effects are magnificent and all the more so because they don't take over the movie. The conflict between good and evil and the choice between the desire for power and the dread of the corruption it brings are concepts based on the characters rather than on the special effects and the characters are always in the forefront in this movie.  No review would be complete without a tribute to Daniel Radcliffe. The whole series depended entirely on Harry being believable, likeable and someone with whom the audience could identify. Important though Ron, Hermione and the supporting cast were, it was with Harry that this series stood or fell. Without ever being guilty of scene-stealing, Daniel Radcliffe brought Harry to life brilliantly and never more so than in this movie. I'll be very disappointed if he isn't recognized by the Academy for a performance amazing in its scope for anyone, let alone someone who first played the role when he was 11 years old.  This was a fitting conclusion to a series which is by far the most successful in the history of film-making. Did they save the best for last? Yes, they did.    A short additional comment on the DVD. While I am not interested in downloading the movie, I am loving the fact that WB is being told in no uncertain terms what it can do with its Ultraviolet streaming system. Power to the people!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really wanted to like Mockingjay. No, to put it more accurately, I wanted to finish the book and be utterly satisfied with the outcome of Katniss' life. Because, along with so many of you, I'd grown to care deeply for the feisty teen. I wanted her to take out Snow (and Coin as well.) I wanted her to have a profound happily-ever-after with one of the boys she loved. I was even willing to be persuaded one way or the other although I leaned towards self-sacrificing Peeta just a bit. I wanted Prim to grow up to be an herbalist and healer. I wanted Buttercup fat and happy, Haymitch back on the wagon for good, and a cherry on top, please.<br /><br />So did I like it? Did the novel, in fact, satisfy?<br /><br />If you've read the novel, you know that what Ms. Collins delivered fell somewhat outside the purview of my expectations. So much so that it has taken six weeks for all my feelings to settle into something like an opinion. So here it is. Collins didn't deliver either happily-ever-after or up-yours-Capitol the way I expected. Instead, she delivered what I'm going to call realistically-ever-after. Given everything that we know about how humans survive trauma, wartime, and devastating loss, the picture of Katniss rings absolutely true.<br /><br />First the Capitol, and then Coin, spent untold effort trying to figure out how to complete unhitch and neutralize Katniss Everdeen. And they came so close to succeeding. It's nothing short of miraculous that she retains a semblance of sanity after two rounds in the Arena, seeing her entire District destroyed because of her actions, watching as a warehouse filled with people she's comforted are bombed, watching as her companions are horrifically slaughtered while she leads them towards Snow in the Capitol, and seeing her little sister burn to death before her eyes, and so many other horrors. A superhero could survive these things. A fictional character could survive these things. But what makes us love Katniss? She's as true-to-life as they come. A real person--a person who loves and feels deeply--cannot experience these horrors without some degree of insanity, without some desire to end it all.<br /><br />I agonized through the pages detailing Katniss' mental derailment. Why? I kept asking. Why can't I just have Katniss happy and married or happy and single or, well, just happy? Do I need this as a reader? Er, well, yes. Actually I do, if I value truth-telling. And that is what Collins gave me: not what I expected, not what I wanted, but Truth. The last paragraph, the last sentence--these are what reconcile me to the way in which Collins told Katniss' truth:<br /><br />I'll tell them how I survive it. I'll tell them that on bad mornings, it feels impossible to take pleasure in anything because I'm afraid it could be taken away. That's when I make a list in my head of every act of goodness I've seen someone do. It's like a game. Repetitive. Even a little tedious after more than twenty year.<br />But there are much worse games to play.eal person--a person who loves and feels deeply--cannot experience these horrors without some degree of insanity, without some desire to end it all.

B004RC8NUQ|5.0|This has got to be one of the best romantic comedies I've seen, along with The Ugly Truth (Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. Natalie Portman is a great comediene as well as being a great serious actor (Black Swan). There's great chemistry with Ashton Kutcher, who also does great comedic work. A little on the \\"racy\\" side, and stretch of the imagination, the plot has these two as friends with \\"priviledges\\" who eventually fall in love. Lots of laughs and human little twists in the plot that are straight out of true life as most of us have experienced it. Loved it. Buy it. It's a keeper.

B000002MUN|5.0|This is a beautifully written, perfectly performed album.  If you look at the lyrics alone, they are all very personal and every listener can relate to the subject matter.  From \\"There's someone I used to see, but she don't give a damn for me,\\" and \\"people come people grow, some grow young, some grow cold\\" on \\"You dont know how it feels,\\" to \\"you live your life waiting, walking around in a trance, you hang out forever and still miss the dance, and if you get lucky you'll find someone to help you to shoulder the pain that will come\\" Tom Petty's sentimentality and vulnerability reach an all time high, unparalleled in his the \\"Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers\\" years.      But to say this album is sentimental leaves out a whole lot.  \\"Wildflowers\\" contains some of Petty's most bluesy moments as an artist.  The riffs on \\"Honey Bee,\\" \\"Don't Fade on Me,\\" and \\"Cabin Down Below\\" are perfect.  \\"Crawling Back to You,\\" \\"A Higher Place,\\" \\"To Find a Friend,\\" \\"Only a Broken Heart,\\" \\"You wreck Me,\\" and \\"Wildflowers,\\" sound like something that could've been released during the heartbreakers era.      In my 15 years of compulsive cd buying and day in day out listening to the radio 6+ hours a day, I dont know if I've ever heard a more perfect cd.  Front to back, you can listen to this cd on repeat.  There are no low-points on here.  THe music is on point, Tom Petty sounds great, everything down to the order of the songs is perfect.  Its a real ride through the mind of Tom Petty at this stage in his life and career.  Beautiful.  That's all I can say.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|When I finished the Trilogy.      My 11 year old son purchased the Hunger Games for our new Kindle.  I decided I should read it first to make sure the content was appropriate for his young age.   I could not put the book down.  Read day and night!  Purchased Catching Fire within minutes of finishing the first book.  And when I finished that a few days later went right into Mockingjay.      While reading the books, I felt like I really knew Katniss and was a part of her life. There were times when my heart pounded with excitement, pounded for fear, ached for love and at times I cried.  In the end, when I finished the books, I felt like I had to say good-bye to my best friend.  Its been a long time since a piece of literature has stirred so much emotion for me.    I Loved the series and I my son has started reading it now. He may be a little young for the content, but he and I can discuss any questions he has.
B000X1N440|2.0|Lynne Truss spends an interminable amount of the reader's time grousing about misplaced apostrophes, but scattered throughout her book are misplaced quote marks, one of my pet peeves. I had to tie my hand behind my back to keep from transposing them with a pencil. Why didn't the publisher also produce a book for American readers? I understand the book has sold well, so it couldn't have been for monetary reasons.<br /><br />Maybe it's sort of a snobby thing like Alex Trebek's penchant for misplaced quote marks in the Jeopardy answers. People used to write to him about it; he made it very clear to his audience that he wasn't changing them. Apparently, people have given up because he doesn't mention it anymore.<br /><br />For a superb critique of this book, read the one that appeared in the New Yorker. I did, and I learned more about punctuation than Lynne Truss knows.
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|Jaycee is indeed a survivor and I hope she lives a long happy life but this book needed far more editing.  There is too much written about the various cats and other animals.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Stick a fork in the Harry Potter film franchise or as I like to call it - the Revival of Geriatric British Actors. There's a bittersweet pang because it's all over now, the books and the films and whatever was left of that sense of anticipation. But overriding that is this sense of relief and satisfaction. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II has kept faith with the source material, with the fans, and with fans of good cinema in general. It's a terrific send-off. I'm not saying this is the best film in the franchise; I've got fondness for THE PRISONER OF AZKHABAN and THE GOBLET OF FIRE, but it's damn close.<br /><br />J.K. Rowling's final book is my least favorite, or, more specifically, the bits in that book that involved wandering the friggin' woods. So you won't be surprised when I say that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART I meandered and moved like molasses for me despite all the terrific character work that went into it. Conversely, PART II is ridiculously fast-paced and, for the most part, focused on the epic Battle of Hogwarts, and it didn't lack for harrowing moments (this is rated PG-13, by the way, and the film handily earns it). PART II picks up very soon after the closing events of PART I, with the death of the house elf Dobby. There's a stillness - or maybe it's hushed anticipation - to these opening scenes as Harry, Hermione, and Ron are caught in temporary respite. But it's only the calm before the storm, and soon enough these three leap back into the fray. Minutes into the film, we witness an audacious heist at the Gringotts Wizarding Bank. The pace doesn't let up after that.<br /><br />- Harry Potter, to Hermione: \\"When have any of our plans actually worked? We plan, we get there, all hell breaks loose.\\"<br /><br />That right there is indicative of Harry's mindset. And maybe what I've liked best about Harry is that he's clearly not the brains of the outfit (that's Hermione). Harry Potter gets by on sheer pluck and determination, and since I'm no brains either, Harry's qualities are those which I can definitely relate to. You can work your way to being plucky and determined - brains are more problematic to come by. It's been six months since Harry, Hermione, and Ron were last at Hogwarts, and sweeping changes have been effected. There's a palpable repressive mood hanging about. Professor Snape has become headmaster. Harry's allies have hunkered down into this rebellious guerilla unit. The search for the four remaining Horcruxes - enchanted items which house parts of Voldemort's soul - has led our kids back to their school, just in time for the final reckoning. Voldemort, thru his mystical link to Harry, is all too aware that three of the Horcruxes have already been destroyed, and he takes immediate steps to amass his army and lay siege to Hogwarts. There's something fairly awesome in seeing the professors of the houses of Hogwarts combine their mystic arts to invoke a protective spell around the school. The action sequences are granted epic stature, and there's even this gritty HENRY V vibe to the thing. When one invests in seven previous films, these final battle scenes definitely mean something, especially since plenty of the combatants end up paying for it. Hogwarts is demolished.<br /><br />Was there a lump in your throat, I wonder? The film delivered moments in which I threatened to tear up. But then there are also those \\"Hell, yeah!\\" moments. It's gratifying to see Maggie Smith let loose as Professor McGonagall. Those familiar with the books are clued in about Neville Longbottom, and he drew some of the biggest applause in the movie theater. But I have to say that my favorite bit of death duel happens between the wicked loony Bellatrix Lestrange and Mrs. Weasley.<br /><br />I'll have to see this again, and maybe several more times. Partly it's because I know I missed out on some detail, some tidbit I overlooked and, ergo, never got a chance to savor. Partly, it's because I don't quite want to let go yet. How do you follow up on Harry Potter? What, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians? Please. J.K. Rowling had layered in such richness and charm and a sense of spectacle and wonder into Harry's world that it's achieved its own reality, and the movies have conveyed those traits brilliantly onto the screen. The acting, across the board, is superb, with our three teens - Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint - holding their own against the vaunted elder thespians (I had a feeling Alan Rickman was gonna be outstanding, and he is). The special effects retain the standard that's been held to this franchise - meaning that it's superb. HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART II acts as an entirely satisfying, emotionally gripping finale to what has been one of the finest cinematic franchises ever. Well, okay, the epilogue may possibly draw a snicker or two.<br /><br />Oh, and there isn't enough of Luna Lovegood, dammit. For that bit of neglect, I say to the script writers: \\"Furnunculus!\\"ant to let go yet. How do you follow up on Harry Potter? What, with Percy Jackson and the Olympians? Please. J.K.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|UPDATE: Apple's support for MIDI via USB is great and works flawlessly for me. It would be nice if photo viewing wasn't limited to camera formatted folders so that you can use flashdrives (without formatting them), but it overall works very nicely as-is.<br /><br />------<br /><br />The SD card function I had no issues with (I used an 8gb Toshiba). It does take a while to load the first time, but that's understandable since I had a lot of pictures and videos. And you must import to the iPad first, you can't just upload from the SD card.  The USB function is entirely useless thanks to Apple's voltage restriction to this adapter (and any others). It WAS useful, now it's useless by an update. Until they fix the problem, I keep my rating.<br /><br />As for Blueproton, I don't trust them. I got it shipped fast and all, but their promotion did not work for me. I added both to my cart, and in my final balance it did NOT subtract the price of the promotion. Also, a few days ago this was 30.99, now it's 34.99, so beware of their price. They toy with it.

B004WJRF6C|5.0|I made the decision to buy this new remastered version because of reviews here on Amazon. Although this was never my favorite solo McCartney album, I was intrigued when I read reviews that mentioned the clarity and seperation of each instrument, and how each loud snap on the drums could be heard as if he was recording in the same room with you. Yes I agree completely....I'm hearing sounds on this new cd that I never heard on the old one...every little guitar lick, and every bass note, even the softest ones, have been lifted out of the mix. Also his voice is so clear and robust, it really does sound live, especially on great tracks like Maybe I'm Amazed, and Ooh You, (always my favorite). As for the bonus cd, I am pleasantly surprised. Not too many reviews mentioned how good it is, so I will. There are fabulous sounding, live versions of the wonderful classics, Maybe I'm Amazed and Every Night, plus an interesting version of Maybe I'm Amazed from One Hand Clapping, which is very nice to hear also. Another great sounding, and enjoyable surprise is the instrumental backing of another favorite of mine, Momma Miss America aka Rock and Roll Spring time, but it's title on the bonus cd is Don't Cry Baby, and starts with the sound of baby Mary crying. There are only two tracks that are forgettable. The horrible 'Suicide' demo which seems to go on forever, and another horror, Women Kind is less annoying and kind of comical, but nevertheless best forgotten. However the remastered sound on all of the bonus tracks is as clear, and exciting as the main cd. Like the Beatles 2009 remastered catalog and the 2010 Band on the Run cd, the remastering job was done by the same team of Allan Rouse and Guy Massey. I'm happy to say that this is a must have. Fabulous remastering job! A treat for the ears.
B00004TJKI|5.0|A flawless and ground-breaking work.<br />The first movie to handle court-room drama.<br />One of the first movies also to go so deep in a rape case.<br />Script is top class, and so is acting and casting.<br />A great performance from James Stewart and George C Scott.<br />Duke Ellington's music fits extremely well - another first timer!<br />Overall, a great work. A must watch.

B004YM67TI|3.0|Possible Spoilers<br /><br />Catherine Hardwicke (who directed \\"Twlight\\") puts a new spin of the classic fairy tale of Red Riding Hood. In a remote village named Daggerhorn there is a deal between the villagers and a werewolf, present a sacrifice and they are spared. Now after so many years the wolf has broken this truce by killing the older sister of Valerie (Amanda Seyfried, \\"Mamma Mia\\" and \\"Jennifer's Body\\"). Her mother (Virginia Madsen \\"Sideways\\") has set her up to be wed to a man of wealth but Valerie loves another. After a group attempts to hunt down the beast, a hunter (Gary Oldman, \\"The Fifth Element\\") warns everyone the beast is someone in the village and that it takes human form. As the body count rises it becomes obvious that the wolf wants Valerie who seems to have an odd connection with the beast, and it will kill to get her.<br /><br />The movie is a very different take on the Red Riding Hood story, it has a cool setting, the acting is decent by some and passable by everyone else. It is kinda obvious who the wolf is from early on and especially when Valerie comes face to face with the it, its even more blatantly obvious. This doesn't take away from the movie being entertaining and cool visually, but its just very predictable which is a notch against it. That aside it is worth watching, some will love it, some will hate it, and more will find it like I found it. Like the headline says, \\"Its unique but flawed, but it does have good parts and they outweigh the bad.\\" **1/2 out of 4 stars.
1451629184|5.0|I saw Jaycee Dugard's interview with Diane Sawyer a few weeks back and was very touched by her honesty as well as her positive attitude after all she's been through.  I wanted to show my support and sometimes the best way to do that is with your wallet.  :)    Like I told my husband and friends who have not read it yet, it feels wrong to say this book is fantastic, because doing so is at the expense of her suffering...and let me tell you, Jaycee suffered at the hands of a monster and his wife.  The book is very simply written, but don't be mistaken, it is very detailed.  She does not leave anything out and at times, it was hard to keep going.  I found myself reading it as fast as I could to get to the part where she and her daughters were rescued.      The whole time I was reading A Stolen Life, I kept wondering who suffered more, Jaycee or her mother.  18 years is such a long time.  But both of them hung on to each other and the longing to be reunited.  As a mother, I can't imagine the pain Terry suffered...the not knowing, the guilt, the waiting.    If you want to believe miracles happen, read this book.  It will validate that there is always a flicker of hope in even the most grim situation.  It will also put your life in perspective and remind you how lucky and blessed you are.  You'll also probably hug your kids a little tighter tonight and never forget to kiss them goodbye.      Enjoy this story of triumph.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Not only is this the story of the sad life of Jaycee Dugard, her fight to hold onto her sanity for the sake of her children, and the hope of someday reuniting with her lost loved ones, there's also an underlying story about the two weak women who contributed to her abduction.      One of the two weak women to fail Jaycee was, of course, Nancy Garrido, the wife who assisted her husband, Phillip, in the abduction and enabled him to carry out his sick fantasies with Jaycee.  She could have refused to help him, she could have helped Jaycee to escape without her husband's knowledge, or at the very least, she could have reported him while he was in jail, but she was too weak and too afraid of having no man in her life, of being alone.  She's a pathetic, weak woman.     The other weak woman to fail Jaycee was (and I'm sure this will not be a popular opinion) her mother, Terry Probyn.  While Terry should have been Jaycee's ultimate protector - keeping her safe - she instead married a man that did not make Jaycee feel safe, a man she didn't think even liked her, a man who was mean to her, and a man who constantly criticized her.  I have to blame Terry for choosing to marry this man, when it should have been obvious that she was allowing a man to become a part of Jaycee's life with whom she was not happy to be around, let alone live under the same roof.  If Carl wasn't so scary to her, she would have asked him to drive her to school or walk her to her bus stop, since she didn't like walking alone.  At the very least, she wouldn't have been afraid to say good-bye to him before walking out the door, but she simply felt that he didn't care about her, and she didn't want to hear the next in a long line of criticisms before she left for school.  Carl has interviewed that he walked her to the bus stop, but Jaycee says in her book that she never saw him that morning.  Isn't it telling that, two years after reuniting with her mother, she hasn't wanted to see Carl?  Carl interviews that Terry could never forgive him for not doing more to save Jaycee that morning, which led to their break-up.  Terry may not want to admit it, but I'm sure that part of the reason for their break-up was that she couldn't live with the guilt of bringing him into her daughter's life and forcing Jaycee to live with her mother's choice for a husband. As much as my heart aches for the 18 years she lost with her daughter, I think a little blame could be placed at her feet.  She picked a man who didn't protect her child.  He was uncaring and unloving towards his step-daughter.  I have real doubts about his recounting of that day.  I'm not saying he is responsible, but he failed to protect his step-child by making her feel as though he didn't care about her, and that is the reason she was alone that morning.
0545259088|5.0|If you've read the past two books involving these lovely characters, all from mercy falls. Don't wait..GET IT NOW! When it involved bringing everything together and giving it an ending to die for, final books like these don't come as they go. These characters that she has created develop so much it helps you understand and just love the characters even more. Isabel and Cole relationships grows into something no one but the readers and the two characters can understand. The ending was a bit of a cliff hanger, ya know? of course you wouldn't unless you already have, sorry sorry i just finished the book and i HAD to write a review, but back to this, it leaves you knowing that its there..the love that they now have realized has been there all along. Grace and Sam, well they're just meant to be from the get go. All in all i don't want to spoil it i'm sorry but you just have to read it. The book just draws you in, giving you nothing but that urge to know what's going to happen next. Mercy Falls is a place where unexpected things happen every day good or bad, I loved it all! (:
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|And so here we are, the end of the line. After 10 years and billions of dollars in ticket sales, much critical acclaim and millions upon million of people entertained, we have the final installment in the Harry Potter saga. Is it everything the fans could hope for?    Basically, yes.    The film picks up where last year's film, the aptly-named Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, left off. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson), are all hiding out at a beach house. Dobby the house elf has died and been buried. Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), is dead (and despite that state, he still gets more to do here than he did in the recent Doctor Who Christmas special), Snape (Alan Rickman), is in charge of Hogwart's, and Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), is on the rise. All is grim and doom for our heroes.    But in typical Potter fashion, Harry doesn't take it lying down. He bribes one of the Gringott's goblins (Warwick Davis, playing one of his two roles in this movie), to help him and his friends get a sword from the vault. This launches them back into the fight and in quick order they've dealt with a dragon, defended Hogwart's (with no small number of deaths on both sides), and everyone, especially Harry, has grown and changed.    I really liked that everyone had something to do in this story. Ron and Hermione get their own little adventure getting a basilisk fang, Snape gets the most character development he's had in the entire series (and proves that, in many ways, he's the real hero of the stories, not Harry), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith, who would make an excellent Granny Weatherwax, should those books ever get made into movies), organizes the Hogwarts defenses in a battle that includes most of the best actors in the UK, including Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, David Thewliss and Miriam Margolyes (who would make an excellent Nanny Ogg, should those books ever get made into movies). Even Draco gets something to do, and proves thathe's not an evil little thing like he's been set up to be in the past.    For those of us who were at all concerned that the producers might pull a few punches in order to keep this a \\"kids\\" movie, worry not. The level of death and destruction is quite high. Everyone that I can recall dying in the book, dies here, some in more spectacular ways than others. The film also does a great job of sustaining an atmosphere of dread and fear, eventually leading to... well, you know what it leads to. Frankly, the make-up job in the end scene got several laughs in my theater, though I thought it was just fine.    I also appreciated the fact that, frankly, this movie flowed better than the book. Much as I liked the novel, it was, as I've mentioned before, a bit of Harry Potter and the Endless Camping Trip. Here there's none of that. I think the producers made an excellent choice in breaking this up into two separate films. It really benefited the material.    This is usually the part of the review where I say, \\"Not everything is perfect,\\" but really I can't think of a single thing to complain about. I would definitely recommend against seeing this in 3-D, for what that's worth. All you're going to get is a darker, washed-out version of a movie that already has a fairly dark palette. Don't cheat yourself like that.    The Harry Potter movies and books have been a real cultural triumph and the fact that even the weakest among them have still been better than much of what's out there is no small accomplishment. Kudos to everyone involved for making a truly great series!

B004Y1USV2|2.0|To begin with the ONLY positive comment I can make concerning the latest \\"Yes\\" (and I use the term VERY loosely) is the Trevor Horn did an admirable job production-wise. Spot on throughout. However, that's where the good part ends and everything is a sham. Jon's voice and lyrics were the heart of Yes. Benoit David, while being a decent singer comes across as a wannabe. Having seen/heard him sing with \\"Yes\\" on YouTube, I had to laugh as he was exactly what he was before Chris found him.....a singer in a Yes cover band.    Over the years Yes has gone through many personnel changes, some good and some bad. Having been a Yes fan since their very first recording, imho, this is the absolute worst ! Without Bill Bruford and Rick Wakeman, the band may as well hang it up. Alan's drumming is putting me to sleep with that constant 4/4 rudimentary drumming. Bill can do syncapation in his sleep! What this band did to Jon was criminal. During the \\"Making of\\" video at one point Chris and Trevor were talking about having a discussion over \\"several drinks\\" which I assume led to the brainstorm of recording material that is over 20 years old, utilizing lyrics that are insipid at best and totally ignoring the man that helped make this band what it was for over 40 years. Well guys, look who has egg on their face now ? Go back to Asia, White, Conspiracy or ANY other band. In this incarnation, Yes is done.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I've seen some reviewers (negatively) compare this movie to Twilight. I would only guess that the majority of these reviewers haven't actually seen Twilight - because, aside from young people and romance (which describes quite a few movies out there...), they have nothing in common. This movie is interesting, exciting, and light on emo; the story is one of survival, rather than a lengthy romance seasoned occasionally with just a pinch of adventure. This is an adventure complicated by romance, rather than a romance complicated by adventure. All of which isn't to knock Twilight - it achieves what it tries to do successfully - but to point out that this is not Twilight. At all. So, enough about what it isn't. Now onto what it is.<br /><br />(spoilers)<br /><br />I am Number Four is the story of a young alien who has yet to come into his powers; he is one of 9 gifted alien youngsters who were destined to protect their (now destroyed) planet. After Number 3 is killed by the marauding invading aliens who destroyed Number 4's planet, Number 4 and his protector flee to Paradise, Ohio. Number 4 (now \\"John Smith\\") gets involved in some teen drama (football players who pick on the science nerd, Sam [who claims that his father was abducted by aliens]) and falls for the football player's ex, Sarah. While highschool trouble brews, the evil aliens are getting closer and closer to discovering them; when \\"John's\\" protector goes missing, he and Sam set out to find him. Things go south from there, ending with a spectacular showdown that includes a fight between dragon-like monsters and a dog/dinosaur-like \\"pet\\".<br /><br />(end spoilers)<br /><br />I won't say that any of this is original (it's not; it's mostly all been done somewhere). But it is good, and it's done well. The acting is good, the interactions are more or less believable (even with the well-used bully-football-players theme), and it's quite interesting. Would see again. A friend of mine put it like this: \\"This was a movie about aliens *and* teens - by all rights, it should have stunk.\\" Maybe so, but lucky for us, it didn't. 5/5 starsall rights, it should have stunk.\\" Maybe so, but lucky for us, it didn't. 5/5 stars

B0034G4ORC|4.0|Overall, I was pretty impressed by this film. There were times that I thought the characters were a little too stereotyped or the dialog a little too cheesy, but all things considered, this was a well done and interesting film.<br /><br />The setting is earth just as an alien invasion begins; the story focuses on a band of Marines who have to escape and then destroy a bunch of aliens. It's simple and straightforward, and doesn't deviate from that; there are no surprises or jaw dropping moments, but it is exactly what it promises to be. The characters are, in many ways, a whole bunch of stereotypes...the older Marine who is past his prime...the commander who is young and green...the commander whose men died while he made it out alive...etc. But they were handled in such a way that you didn't notice, really, unless you thought about it - in other words, no one stood out as being a stereotyped character. They all just made sense how they were, and made for some interesting team dynamics.<br /><br />As it was, I thought this movie came together quite well. It reminded me of a sort of modern day take on War of the Worlds, which is pretty cool. 4/5 stars; very well done.

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|I have a 2007 Honda Accord with a build in iPhone/iPod jack. Problem is, the phone constantly disconnects from the cable. After buying the converter cable, I've had no problems whatsoever. Couldn't be happier.
B004V6MWFU|2.0|This is coming from a huge Pearl Jam fan who has been a die hard fan of both PJ and EV since Ten. Into the Wild was a incredible album, but Ukulele Songs is just plain old bland. I've listened to it 6 times now and it has not grown on me at all. I'm actually kind of surprised that Ed would release this since he is such a perfectionist (in the studio). I was really expecting a great album from one of the greatest rock singers in American History, but I'm sorry to say this is just plain laughable.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|The best way to see this movie is the Original Theatrical Version, because it has the original audio track from 1978.   But the problem is that Warner Bros. messed up the audio track on the early releases of the Four-Disc set, with no distinction between the early releases and the later ones, so unfortunately it's a gamble on which one you will get.  The 2000 Expanded Edition, has a new audio track with different sound effects than the original. The only reason to watch the 2000 version is the Music Only Track. The added scenes are not that important. The bonus material is great. Disc 3 has all of the previous extras from the 2001 release, disc 4 has all new extras(New as of 2006).
B0045U9WPU|5.0|Warning: MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.    Delirium....Wow. What an amazing, heart tugging, gut wrenching, tear jerking, beautifully written piece of literature. I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down.    It could be described as a typical teenage love story: a girl who views herself as utterly average is admired by a boy she consideres to be perfect. The girl, in this case, Lena Haloway, meets and eventually falls in love with Alex, a boy from the forbidden lands outside her community's borders called the Wilds. In a futuristic society in which love is considered a disease, the deadly amor deliria nervosa, Lena has to come to terms with her intense attraction to Alex and what will happen when she has to face her 'procedure' that will cure her forever of strong emotions like love. Lena is also haunted by the memory of her mother, who committed suicide because lost love was too much to handle. Or did she?     I found Lena to be a very relatable character, and I really enjoyed reading about her journey and her struggles to defend her right to love Alex. Was she slighlty hysterical at times? Yes. But wouldn't you be if everything you knew and your way of life was turned against you? Wouldn't you be shocked and angry that your mother wasn't really dead, and the people you trusted most to take care of you lied to you your whole life? Lena finds strength at the end of the novel that makes her a refreshing heroine.     As for Alex, while I did think that his and Lena's romance was a beautiful and heart breaking tale, I found him almost too perfect. Lena's perception of him proved her intense love, but her constant downing on herself made her seem unappealing. Still, I was rooting for them to escape the entire novel so that they could be together 'without walls' as they both said.     And the ending.... Wow, the ending. Could never, in a million years, have seen it coming. A climax to the very end. And an end that brought me to tears. A cliffhanger. I watched the percentage bar on my Kindle and was frantically wondering how she would finish with only 4% left, then 3, then 2. How could it possibly end so quickly? How would they escape? I don't want to give it away completely, but it was heart stopping, tragic, and intense. If Oliver wanted her readers to be clinging onto her story and drooling for a sequel, she succeeded.    I cannot say enough about the quality of Lauren Oliver's writing. It was wonderful, it was descriptive, it was so metaphorically perfect. There was no question exactly how Lena was feeling at every point of her journey. There was no doubt in my mind how the town of Portland, Maine looked. It was refreshing and wonderful and rich to read. There were moments of passion. Moments of breathless anticipation. Of shock. Of tears. Delirium peaks your interest, lulls your senses, then wakes them up again in a way that is thrilling.     Amazon rated this one of the best books for Kindle, and I agree. Oliver has created a new world that is both believable and heart pounding. Her characters are endearing. The heroes are relatable and wonderful at the right moments, the cured are hatable and feared at the tense twists. I have read that this is the first of a trilogy, and I will be waiting with baited breath for the sequel to Delirium. Its and infectious, wonderful book, one that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good read. But be prepared: when you pick up Delirium, you won't be able to put it down. If love is a disease, then I am infected with love for this book.
0553801473|2.0|Six Years.<br /><br />I waited six years for progress and answers and all I got was more cliff hangers.<br /><br />Because George knows the only way we will wait another 6 years is if he resolves as little as possible.<br /><br />When I neared the end of the book I had such high hopes. So many threads were converging, it would clearly end in an amazing climax.<br /><br />But it didn't.<br /><br />I am sure this book will get some good reviews. It has some pleasant chapters and was enjoyable to read, but that is simply because I and many others have waited so long, that we would be happy with anything new.<br /><br />But this is no book to re-read.<br /><br />For every surprise, there is a hundred pages of tedium.<br /><br />The book meanders about, and feels like George wrote simply for the sake of writing. It was all build up and no release, and that's bloody unacceptable after six years of waiting.<br /><br />I know there will be fans of the book, those who angrily defend it, and I really wish I was one of them. But instead of sliding this book onto my bookshelf, well satisfied, I simply want to throw it out a window.<br /><br />I really couldn't be anymore disappointed.
031237593X|5.0|I loved this book.  I found the characterization to be outstanding.  The main characters really came alive.  The dialogue and description were also quite good.  This is just very good writing and very entertaining.  Personally, I've rarely felt 900 pages fly by so quickly.  I also learned a lot as I read, and regardless of whether it's completely accurate in how it handles Richard III and his nephews, it inspired in me an interest in Richard III.  I would highly recommend this book to those who enjoy historical fiction and are not daunted by the length.      Note: this book had more sexual content than I care for (I prefer it to be implied rather than described), but it wasn't extremely explicit and was relatively little considering the book is over 900 pages.  Some language, but not that frequent.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Although other reviewers have pointed out that the film is based on Patrick O'Brian's \\"canon\\" of 20 books which constitute, in their entirety, a 7,000 page novel, complaints that 'Master and Commander' doesn't tell the story of any one of the books are misplaced, in my opinion. In fact, the film cherry-picks the highlights of certain themes that run through most of the 20 novels, and does it very well. The personality conflicts that give life and substance to the friendship of the two principal characters -Captain Jack Aubrey and physician/naturalist Stephen Maturin, are revealed, but not overdone. The depiction of the early 19th century British Navy as a square-fisted, hard-drinking band of brothers brought together by shared hardship and mortal danger is vividly displayed in a way not often found in cinematic nautical adventure stories.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a narrow viewpoint, but in my opinion the visual effects of HMS Surprise seal this film as one of the greats in its genre. This is not a model in a millpond, but a genuine working square-rigged ship: the Rose, renamed Surprise for the film. The scenic shots of the ship under way are breathtaking. So often in sailing films we see sails flapping in the breeze so as to make it seem \\"real\\" in Hollywood's misguided opinion. In 'Master and Commander' every sail is drawing, luffs quivering, lines taut... in other words, it seems real because it is real. The depiction of the almost unimaginably crowded and Spartan conditions, taken as quite normal by the men of those times, are wonderfully brought to life.<br /><br />The music is delightful, based as it is on a significant element of the story. Aubrey and Maturin are in fact fairly accomplished musicians on the violin and cello respectively, and that shared delight is a strong part of the glue that holds them together. Use of period music (Bach, Corelli) for violin and cello as background for well chosen scenes is inspired. The ship and the music flow together, giving both a visual and aural sense of the times.<br /><br />Crowe was an excellent choice for the Aubrey character. He seems to understand that while Aubrey isn't given to excessive displays of emotion (except laughing while drunk at table, or in the midst of battle), he is not immune to them. Crowe resists the temptation to overplay Aubrey's subdued emotional reactions in order to \\"give them life\\", and instead gives us the man imagined by the novelist: naturally inclined to a jovial nature, extroverted, often kind, but quite steely when it came to his ship and his duty. Crowe captures the man splendidly.<br /><br />The Maturin character is sometimes cited as miscast, but in my view the only miscasting lies in his appearance; the Maturin of the novels is frequently described as \\"ill-looking\\". Given the Hollywood obsession with good looks, it must be hard to cast for \\"ugly\\" and still get excellent acting skills, the field being so limited. And having Maturin reasonably good looking doesn't really detract from the story, except for the purist. He is otherwise true to character in the film.<br /><br />It would be easy for a devoted follower (of which I am one) of Patrick O'Brian's canon to concentrate on the mixed plot inconsistencies and thus mutter through the movie. But that would be at the cost of missing out on a truly outstanding look at a colorful and exciting time, and the kinds of men who made those times history.<br /><br />'Master and Commander -the Far Side of the World' will be an excellent addition to your library. I bought and received it only a month ago, but have already watched it three times. It's not that one expects anything \\"new\\" with the re-viewing.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I am an active and enthusiastic home cook who was fed up with knives so dull that they could simply no longer cut much of anything. I have a block of fairly costly knives, but in lieu of replacing them, I had become dependent on my serrated tomato knife because it was the only reliable one left. Having reached my limit, I sought out a really excellent yet relatively inexpensive sharpener and gave this one a try after all of the glowing reviews. My only concerns were that (1) I have no experience sharpening knives and hoped I wouldn't wreck my knives in error and (2) this seemed to be a sharpener beloved by professionals and folks who depend on work knives, so I wondered if I was in over my head. Dear home cooks: this sharpener is worth every penny, it's so easy to use, and in three strokes on the ceramic side, I have knives that are sharper than when I first bought them. I easily, smoothly, swiftly *sliced strawberries* this morning with one of my formerly useless knives - no big deal in the grand scheme of things, but for me, terrific. I repaired my trusty tomato knife, and now it's unstoppable. I basically have a block of new, extremely sharp knives. Just be gentle and slow about the sharpening, and I think at least the inexperienced, basic knife users, and ordinary home cooks out there will be just fine.

B004S699K4|3.0|Im on the fence regarding this release. Yes it has better picture quality than the dvd however as previously reported the aspect ratio is off. The good news is that you dont lose any picture, you actually gain picture. The bad news is that the extra picture is really not what the director wanted. Its not the travesty that everybody is making it out to be but it is annoying if you care about the directors vision. BTW I took a star off my rating for the cover alone. Why they just didn't use the original cover art is beyond me/

0307454541|1.0|The only element saving this book from immediate assignment to the Boring Bin is its Swedish setting, which brings one a little insight into that culture and climate and geography.  Otherwise, it is a dull read, much over-ballyhooed.  The publisher must have been having a very slow year to promote this book.<br /><br />It is too long and most of its characters shallow and unrealistic, especially Salander, \\"the girl with the dragon tatoo\\", who is not even the principal character -- and the dragon tatoo is totally without significance to the tale!  The author seems to have little sensitivity to the feminine mindset and emotion  -- no young girl has been that cold and calculating lately.  The Salander character resembles more a delinquent teenaged boy.  The translator, if he or she had any imagination, could have done this book a world of good.  Really, the cover is the most interesting part of this book.

For an ereader I love the nook.  - battery life is awesome.   would be nice if this was solar powered like calculators.  - the display looks great, even in direct sunlight more or less.    - The simple touch looks cool, very simplistic. no buttons all touchscreen for the most part.   - The extra $40 warrenty guarentees replacement of damaged nook.      covers anytype of damage from what I understand.  - Not as many CCNA/cisco books in epub as kindle but the list is growing fast.  - No adds    what I dont like;  - only comes with 200mb of internal memory.  You have to pick up a microSD card  - Cant delete files or books, there is simply no option for it. Im hoping for a patch.     which means you have to plug it in usb and delete stuff from your desktop.      Its very annoying.    What Id like to see;  - new screensavers for download  - better support for PDF files  - ability to read word doc  - solar power, geez why not it only makes sense.
0671449028|5.0|My daughter loves this book (along with all other Sandra Boynton books!).  We read this story almost every night at my daughter's request.  It's such a cute and funny little book.  The illustrations are great along with the rhyming storyline.  I know we will continue to enjoy this story for years to come!

B0056BMK6K|5.0|Being someone new to commercial writing and Kindle Direct Publishing, any help or advice on marketing is appreciated, especially from someone who has generated over one million sales in just five months.     The thing to remember when considering direct-publishing is that now writing becomes just the beginning of your literary adventure. If you can write creatively, and write in a style that endears you to an army of loyal readers, then your primed for success. And with the launch of eBooks, portable reading devices (Kindle) and places like Amazon, publishing itself has become a doddle.     Nowadays YOUR greatest task is in getting the public to buy your book. According, marketing is the key to success, and John Locke's guide will give you the edge over those who procrastinate and dither. And while some may argue that John Locke is teaching others to \\"suck eggs\\", any proven advice is very much appreciated, especially as sometimes it's so easy to miss the \\"bleeding obvious\\". John Locke's book details the mistakes he made in the world of direct publishing, so you don't have to...     Sure his book is short and sweet, but then again, why write a chapter when a paragraph will suffice. Personally I think John Locke's book could have been shorter, while the advice given could have included detailed information on formatting and uploading your book. The key to your success will be in your ability to adapt John Locke's methods to support your own circumstances. The premise behind John Locke's success was in his ability to write a series of books, each supporting each other to gain sales.     My own book, [[ASIN:B0059V8462 The Lost Diaries of John Smith]] is a single, stand-alone work of post-apocalyptic science fiction. I have no intention to write a sequel. Accordingly, my first task is to adopt/adapt what will work for me. Consequently, I've created my own blog site and have started to use twitter, both suggested and proven tools in John Locke's arsenal.     His readers are drawn into the Locke family of books through loyalty and carefully nurtured friendship betwixt author and reader. This is where blogging and tweets come in handy. This closeness itself is something new to publishing, and is in stark contrast to the days when the publisher maintained a buffer between the reader and the author. The internet has created the means to bring these parties closer together, which for some (me included) can be daunting, especially if like me you find it difficult (frightening) to make new friends on the internet.     It's difficult to add to what John Locke has readily provided in his book. My own advice is to note down what will work for you and your circumstances. You need to formulate your own marketing plan, and not everything that John Locke suggests will work for you, but take it from me, what didn't work for him probably wont work for you either.
0061353248|5.0|My short and sweet review is:  intellectual and entertaining. Dan Ariely is one of the best and you may find (as I did) that this book is smart, funny and well worth your time. Based on reality and not just theory, Dr. Ariely is full of useful knowledge that he transfers to the reader in an enjoyable way. This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|It is difficult to imagine the life Jaycee led with her captor and his wife.  It is difficult to comprehend the experiences this brave girl, now woman, went through: abuse, delivering her 2 children at home with no medical care, providing as normal a life as she could for her 2 daughters, and much more.  Despite the atrocities and incomprehensible actions imposed on her by her captor, Jaycee put on a brave face everyday for her children and for all of their survival and now she puts on the brave face again and relives those moments to tell us all about it so we can try to understand.      Jaycee does a good job trying to explain and illustrate to us her life during captivity.  While describing her ordeal she provides moments of reflection of what she felt or thought during these times.  Kudos to Jaycee for being brave enough to share with her story despite the difficulty in rehashing the past.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I feel this was a very good movie and with a great plot.  But even with a headset, I found some of the talking somewhat hard to make out and its a complicated movie and if you cant hear it, that makes for bad.
B003Y5H542|5.0|It was a nice surprise to find that the blu-ray version had both theatrical and extended versions! The storyline is very funny and the animation was best i have seen of any CG animated movie! The Mexican setting was excellent and the OWL Mariachi band was the best. I hope Nickelodeon continues to make CG movies!
1439153663|2.0|I was intrigued by the first half, but as the story progressed there was too much tension between the opposing forces, only to have everything resolved in the last two pages.  Not very satisfying.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|Brandon has never been a powerful singer - he always had good voice quality but limited range. Earlier in his career he could hide this defect by just painfully screaming through a rocker. Now that he wants to be Steve Perry his warts come out for all the world to see.  I guess what people have been saying about him - that he can't sing - had some grain of truth after all. The last good Incubus album was \\"Morning View\\" (a slow album like this one but with way more highlights) after that everything went to the toilet for this band. It's also worth noting that that was the last Incubus CD devoid of political antics - some bands can get away with it, some bands can't. Incubus can't.  I've given Incubus two chances to make things right after the absolutely horrible \\"A Crow Left...\\" and they have failed miserably.  This will be my last Incubus album purchase.  It's been nice knowing you guys! Don't worry songs from old records will always be in my playlist. Thanks for the great times!
0780626966|5.0|I can't really write a review for this because I don't own it.  I purchased it via fulfillment through Amazon and the product arrived damaged to me and so I had to send it back for a refund.  Was very disappointed.<br /><br />UPDATED 03/30/2014:  Well, I found this collection via somewhere else.  I changed the rating to 5 stars because the series was awesome, but if I could have rated the service by Amazon at the time that it would have been rated one star for the hassle I went through.  Robert England is by far the one and only Freddy Krueger that plays the roll perfect.  I recommend the series to anyone who can find it that doesn't get it damaged in shipment.  It wouldn't have been so bad if Amazon had another one to replace it with at the time, but they didn't... That is why it was refunded.
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|What lurks beneath? Das Boot. The Boat. If you have watched it you know. If you have never watched this film it is time. Das Boot was directed by Wolfgang Petersen. This is an epic World War II historical classic that takes place in 1941. The perspective is unique because Das Boot is about a U-96 submarine and its German crew. This film basically outlines the trials, tribulations, and dangers that a submarine fleet would face during WWII. Das Boot is an experience because it takes you inside the submarine and practically makes you a member of the fleet. At times it will keep you on the edge of your seat leading up to an unexpected grand finale that you will never forget. The film works well as a distressing vision of war, a critique on the soldiers fighting & generals safety celebrating, and the overall structure of warfare. The lead of this venture is taken up by that of J&uuml;rgen Prochnow as the Commander. He plays an outstanding and unforgettable role as the courageous spirit filled leader of the ship. Check this one out.
B004KNM3EY|5.0|I won't repeat the details already listed elsewhere about the contents of this set, but I will say this is one of the finest deluxe reissues I've ever owned by any artist. Elaborate packaging, impressive liner notes, superb sound quality, fantastic DVD material, and the B-sides on Disc 2 in particular could easily function as a stand-alone album--they're that good.     When a band has a creative epiphany like this, quality seems to pour out of nearly everything they record within that brief window. This set captures Suede's moment of serendipitous chemistry and determined songwriting perfectly. It still amazes me that they were perhaps designated for the scrapheap after Bernard Butler left. Who guessed a masterpiece was on the horizon?    Finally, check out Amazon UK to save some money: This deluxe version of \\"Coming Up\\" is only GBP 9.93, which is approximately $16.00 USD.

B0043RSJ8G|3.0|I love, love, love Jodi Picoult. This book, though, made me mad, and not for the reason you think. I'm an open-minded person, so the homosexual aspect didn't bother me. What bothered me is that the author seemed to spend SO MUCH TIME emphasizing that the Bible doesn't specifically say whether homosexuality is wrong or right. I read a book to enjoy a story, not to be \\"lessoned.\\" Did it pull the heart strings? Yes. Was it as good as The Pact? Not at all. Waiting for the next one....
B004INNRFK|1.0|This concert is not good as the first one. Duet of Michael Bolton and Seal was the worst performance I have ever seen. I am very disappointed. Do not waste your money.
0545259088|2.0|Okay, so the first thing i had a problem with is.. Miss Stiefvater just did not draw out the conclusion like a third book should. Where was the hint of the possibility that a cure could be made!? What happened to Sam? Was he forced to return back into a wolf after he had to lead them to safety? Did he manage to overcome it and still maintain his humanity? How did the mind to mind communication between Sam and Cole work? What happened to Isabel? What happened to Cole? There were a lot of answered questions that I would have loved to have read. It probably would have given the book a hundred more pages but, I like seeing a little chaos in a final book of a trilogy. It just didn't work for me. The first two books were a great read. This book? Complete disappointment. I would have expected a lot more interesting ideas to pop up with when writing about wolves/were-wolves. Creativity wasn't flowing. My imagination wasn't getting enough exercise with this book. Its just like I said, it could have been so much better.
0743299795|2.0|It is now 2011 and Hyundai's manufacturing model is showing substantial superiority to the Toyota model of \\"lean production.\\"     While book makes some valid and relevant points as to why Toyota's model is superior to the conventional Detroit model of mass production, it fails to address the failures of the \\"lean production\\" system, namely the massive recalls of Toyota products. The book also makes some fairly outlandish and frankly preposterous claims of the \\"lean production\\" system becoming the dominant manufacturing system worldwide. A system that Hyundai tried implementing but failed, adapting instead, a system controlled and managed by engineers and scientists driven by information technology. In contrast to a highly trained and skilled common work force of Toyota's \\"lean production\\" model.     Hyundai's model so far has been superior to the Toyota model resulting in remarkable gains in quality, market share and a superior development time frame. In fact, LG and Samsung are also showing far more resilience and market penetration than any of their Japanese electronic counterparts.    Hyundai's model is also far more adaptable to exporting their factories, resulting in greater penetration into developing markets than Toyota's model. Hyundai has factories in China, the United States, the Czech republic, India and bringing factories online in Russia and Brazil as well. Toyota's model requires years of training or the exportation of vehicles from Japan, limiting their adaptability to the markets in which they sell.    The authors show definite favoritism in their bias for Toyota which clouds their judgment and lead them to far fetched conclusions that have, number one, not been realized and, number two, have at best, failed. Toyota's model is not revolutionizing world industry. In fact, it is failing and failing in spectacular fashion.    These same authors must have been part of the original MIT think tank in the early 1990's that concluded Hyundai essentially hadno chance in competing against Japan's and Toyota's, in particular, model of \\"lean production.\\" The Japanese industry felt much the same way and never really took Hyundai as a viable competitor until it was too late. It is now a matter of time until the inevitable takes place and Hyundai supplants Toyota as the best auto manufacturer with the most highly desired products in the industry. Like what Toyota did to GM and Ford, Hyundai is now poised to do to Toyota and Honda.    It will be interesting to see how Toyota adapts to the new challenge posed by Hyundai. Their \\"lean production\\" model has essentially failed and will need some serious modifications in order to make Toyota competitive once again. If history is any guide, Toyota may not recover, even with what the authors' believe is the superior manufacturing system. The Japanese ship building industry isn't competitive with the Koreans and neither is the Japanese electronics industry. In fact, in the United States, Apple is doing very much similar to what Hyundai is doing. Designing and engineering superior products and modularizing the manufacturing process. Apple is the most successful personal electronics company on the planet and vastly more successful than Sony. GM and Ford are looking like they are following the same path and are becoming competitive again also.     It isn't about labor relations either. Hyundai's relationship with it's unionized Korean workers has always been quite adversarial, even more so than GM and Ford. Yet Hyundai puts out world class products. Hyundai, however, has a very good relationship with their Alabama workers much like the Japanese do with their United States plants.    All in all, the book is an interesting read. However, the authors, somehow come to an erroneous conclusion that Toyota's system of \\"lean manufacturing\\" is superior to all others and have let that premise blind them to believe that nothing else could ever be better or supplant it. Hyundai and Apple are showingotherwise with a remarkable resilience and tremendous success using a much different model. Especially in how both were relegated to the grave by the so-called pundits, even the experts at MIT.
030726999X|4.0|I wasn't expecting such a nice hard cover for the book.  For the price I was paying for this book, the hard cover is super bargain.  I will definitely buy again from Amazon.  Hopefully the story lives up the hype and expectations.  A note to buyers from Australia - the parcel will take about a month to arrive but the package is neat and the goods are in great condition.  Plus the cost of buying 3 books from Amazon including shipping to Australia is about the same as buying 1 book in store in Melbourne!!!!  Try it to believe it.
0061784788|5.0|This is the latest book in the Sigma Force novel series, and it's just as thrilling as the rest of them. You continue to get to know the characters, and Rollins is just the best thing going when it comes to suspense.
0553801473|3.0|Something is rotten in the state of Westeros: 5 chapters into the book and suddenly the writing changes dramatically. Who wrote this and what did you do with GRRM? What happened to the deliciously brutal content, the sharp and crystal clear intent that kept me enthralled for days? This text is full of rambling inconsequential details, floppy prose, sophomoric college level fantasy-101 dialogue, then inexplicably interspersed with phrases displaying flashes of the GRRM ferocity. The master seems to be struggling, graceless, exhausted, desperate. I'm not ready for yet another fantasy god to fall ill.
0553801473|3.0|It may be waiting for quite a few years that did it, but the latest installment lost its excitement. I used to swallow the Ice and Fire installments whole in just a couple of days, but I have trouble finishing this one up. I keep putting it down. Some details from the previous books in the series are difficult to recall. I also have trouble connecting with some of the new characters. The book is a lot longer, and it feels like it should have been two books instead.<br />There are still very few fantasy books that compare to this series. However, I give it 3 stars because it has lost its dynamics, some new characters seem one-dimensional and a lot less captivating, and because the book's voluminousness makes the developments hard to follow.<br />I hope that the next installments arrive sooner than I forget this one in its entirety.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|In some alternate world, the classic Yes line-ups for CTTE, Relayer, GFTO etc. might still be in their 20's,making 'classic' Yes albums, and clearly some wish they were, anything else unacceptable. But it's this world, and worth remembering that in this world Yes made one great album pre-Wakeman (The Yes Album), and that the classic line-up also made one brilliant but over-reaching failure (TFTO), and was responsible for the worst Yes effort ever, Tormato. Fly From Here, inevitably given the current line-up, has echoes of Drama and Asia, but there's far more to it than that. It's unmistakeably Yes playing, and with ambition and dynamism. Just nothing like it when that great shining engine hits top gear, and Trevor Horn's production makes the most of some excellent composition. All individual performances are on the spectrum very good to outstanding, and Andersonians should give vocal credit where it's due--- Benoit David is a revelation, and it's great to hear a Chris Squire lead-vocal. There's an interesting difficulty rating it. If you go by Yes's own exalted standards, ok it's not CTTE, but still worth ****. By any other standards at all, it's *****, if not an absolute Masterpiece, certainly a Masterclass in prog, intensely listenable, an inexpressible relief to the ears, to hear an almighty band back on such astonishing form.
0545265355|3.0|I had read that this series equated to Harry Potter or Twilight therefore I was interested.  While this series was good, I would not have equated to the other two series.  The plot was unique and contained interesting twists.  However, it was not a \\"I can't put this down - stay up past my bedtime to read' series. I would recommend the series to others - but found it to definitely be a 'young adult' series.
6304119046|1.0|Even though it was advertised new in its original wrap, the product arrived defective. When I placed it in the VCR, it kept spitting out.  I tried everything, rewinding, fast forwarding, to no avail.  On the fifth try, the tape caught in the machine, so I stopped trying so as not to break the tape or machine.  When I tried to return the tape to the company, they refused to replace it, citing a 30 day return policy. I don't want my money back; just a working video. But no luck.  I am a film teacher on a limited budget, so I won't be using this company in the future.
B00127RAJY|3.0|i've never watched Jillian Michaels on television. i purchased this dvd because each program was 30 minutes and it had such high reviews overall.    although i believe her workouts have value they weren't my style; i felt like i was back in high school gym class. i like jillian but she exudes too much masculine energy for my taste in workouts. also, i found it annoying that she wouldn't complete the sets, she would do a few but then stop and point out what her assistants were doing, i.e. proper form and somesuch. she did this on every interval.
B005869U6G|1.0|Beyond \\"Switchbalde\\" and \\"Adolescents\\", there is very little here that will leave an impression on new or old Incubus fans; its simply dull. Brandon's voice sounds as good as ever, but the guitar work, usually a hallmark and highlight of any incubus album, is all but gone. Its as if the entire album, save the two tracks mentioned above, consists of tracks suitable as the last on an album...forgettable.     Many of the reviews on here compared this to Morningview-era Incubus; I can assure you, it is not; that album had many highlights.  I am not entirely sure what they were going for with this album, I suspect in time I'll find the value in these songs, but for now, its fallen on deaf ears.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In my opinion, this album is Britney's best. It's almost hard to say so for various reasons. One, being that I love all of her music before and after In The Zone. Second, I am a huge fan of hers! I believe this album is her best mainly because of her artistic control she had on this album. She co-wrote almost every song, and sounds like it came from her heart. This album was (or is) Britney at the time. A young woman, not entirely sure of herself, but just going with her inhibitions. The feel of this album is much different than her previous ones. It's more mature and adult. Even so, I didn't like the album when it came out. Being twelve at the time, I couldn't relate much to it. It wasn't as easy to \\"get\\" as her last efforts. This album has love, heartbreak, sex, girly, and down right dance-at-the-club songs. Britney's vocals, I think, are at her best. Sure, auto tune is used, but her vocals are most raw on this album. Her musical guests on the album are the Ying Yang Twins, and Madonna. If you listen to Britney's music today, it's overly auto-tuned, she doesn't seem to have the same vocals, and her artistic control is almost gone all together. I miss this Britney, and I hope someday she can make an album that's not at least as good as this, but even better.

1451629184|5.0|I downloaded this on my Kindle this weekend and read through the book pretty fast. I have to say that all of the trauma aside, what I walked away from this story with was a complete amazement of how Jaycee had such an \\"old soul\\". She was really a little girl who stopped having emotional enrichment, love, formal education, positive human interaction, etc. at age 11. Despite all of this, she found bits and pieces of this throughout her captivity. She never lost hope and never really completely lost her sense of self. This became evident to me through her journal writings. She allowed herself to hope, she put her hopes, her wishes on paper and thought there was a chance they might come true. She didn't know how but hoped they would. She also found and wrote about things to be thankful for through this process.   We all have tragedy in our lives to varying degrees, but to read what this young woman endured and to see her hang onto the positive has been an inspiration to me. She wrote it, believed it and then manifested it. It was her positive thinking and hope that got her through this ordeal.  We can all learn a lesson from this story. It has inspired me begin journalling again and to make sure that I am keeping a positive attitude an being thankful for all I have.  Jaycee is a survivor of the greatest kind and I have no doubt that as she continues on this journey of healing that she will be fine.
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This was one Amazon's recommended book of the month.  And it started on such a promising note -- historian in the Oxford libray, old alchemy text, DNA investigations of supernatural creatures.  Then a third of the way in, it disintegrated into a Harlequin romance, breast heaver.  Forbidden love, transcendent kisses, lots of hot baths. The hero is prefect, the heroine is helpless, but spunky, they tell each other how in love they at least twice a page. And then 50 pages from the end I realized, there's no way they can clean this up by the end...  It's the beginning of the series, so the book just stops with our heroes fleeing the bad guys and their outcome unknown.
0553801473|2.0|I've been waiting for the release of A Dance With Dragons for six years. It would be hard for anything short of brilliance to live up to expectations after such a long wait, yet ADWD still manages to disappoint.<br /><br />I believe the fundamental problem here is the same one that the late Robert Jordan ran into at around the seventh book point of his epic The Wheel of Time. Put simply, the thought and care that the author puts into world-building comes at the expense of plot development. And such attention to detail becomes extraordinarily draining as the smallest details become magnified and the cast of characters expands and collapses under its own weight. I appreciate the clearly extensive research that GRRM has put into all the different aspects of medieval life, whether it be the clothing or the castles or the ships and so on. I just wish he would get on with the story.<br /><br />To give a concrete example: I consider myself to be a diehard ASOIAF fan but I still have trouble making the distinction between Yunkai, Astapor, Meereen and the other locales in Essos. I simply can't bring myself to care about the characters that inhabit the region either. Unfortunately, much of ADWD is devoted to the exploits of characters bearing names like Hizdahr, Shakhaz, and Yezzan who are not interesting or sympathetic. In my opinion, one of the most compelling aspects of ASOIAF is the dynamic of rival houses with histories stretching back thousands of years, each family tied to a geographical region/landmark and the sigil of some creature with whom they are closely associated. None of this comes into play in the eastern continent, where the storylines focus primarily on the tension between slavers and those opposed to it (something I feel is well-trod ground in other literature). Reading about anonymous men described as wearing the masks of a lion, locust and wolf is not very interesting compared to the ancient enmity between House Stark and House Bolton.<br /><br />GRRM does make some strides when it comes to working in the literary medium. I'm referring mainly to his usage of the POV chapter headings as an indication of a character's state of mind and self-perception. This is especially effective when it comes to the story of Theon Greyjoy. I would go so far to say that ADWD can be read as a self-contained story of his character's development set against the backdrop of larger events taking place in Westeros. In light of this improvement, it is disappointing that primary POV triumvirate of Jon, Daenerys and Tyrion are so flat despite them getting the meat of the book. Jon somehow is portrayed more more dourly duty-bound than Eddard Stark in AGOT, Daenerys can't seem to go anywhere while Tyrion is mobile but never ends up in the right (i.e. more interesting for the reader) place.<br /><br />ADWD is obviously a must-read for those who have been invested in the series from the very beginning, but be forewarned that you will probably leave this Dance feeling hollow and unsatisfied. On the bright side, the bar has been set fairly low for The Winds of Winter which we can all hope will offer more significant plot developments.
B0023ZLMHK|1.0|I am so disappointed in this Kindle rendition of the book: It was hard to read because of sentences like: \\"Mrs. Bolton made hint aware only of outside things\\" and \\"men were beyond atty mental age calculable.\\"   Many other words are incomprehensible. For $3.99, there is NO EXCUSE for this kind of sloppy editing, when transferring a work to the Kindle format.

B003UESJH4|5.0|We need many more movies like this one--history told like the great human story it is. This movie is well written, well directed, and superbly acted.

B000X107GI|5.0|The original battery in my '06 Audi A4's key fob lasted almost three years before I switched and started using the backup key fob.  Then that battery died and I had to get replacement batteries for both.  Went to Amazon and picked these up.  Real quick to replace: just pop the cover off the fob with a coin or something, pull out the old battery, put in the fresh one, and finally replace the fob cover.  Done.  Great seller.
B0053YEM7U|5.0|I know I'm the one guy on the whole planet who liked the Drama album the most of all Yes albums. So this album gets 5 stars, just because of Trevor Horn and Geoffery Downes involvement.    If you liked Drama you'll like it, although you can absolutely hear bits and pieces of Yes musical styles through the decades throughout the album (which is cool). Don't expect it to sound just like Drama, because it doesn't. That was over 30 years ago after all.    Remember these guys are retirement age now. So it's more mellow edged - nothing like Machine Messiah on this album. It's good though. Good enough to buy in fact. If you liked Drama. Otherwise you probably just won't get it and will make inaccurate comments like \\"it's not Yes without Jon Anderson\\". :)
B0034G4P8K|3.0|Pretty entertaining. Lots of things blow up. There is sort of a story - that makes no sense. The ending went on too long for my taste. Shia LeBoeuf pulls off running pretty good - he's up there with Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford in that aspect of physical acting. Plus they give him some decent lines to say. I think he's improving as an actor. Still he should stick with this franchise. Definitely better than Transformers #2. Ken Jeoung of Community (TV series) fame is absolutely hilarious in a bit role as an engineer with special knowlede of the Decepticon's plot.
B000063V8S|5.0|The fourth seasons of The Next Generation continues the greatness of the third season, but with a few ups and down. The first few episodes are great and focus on family - particularly the parents and brothers of some of the key crew members. In the middle of the season there are a few mediocre episodes, a few good ones - a mix. Towards the end of the season, the focus shifts towards the tensions in the Klingon Empire. Some of the best in this season include \\"Family,\\" \\"Reunion,\\" \\"Data's Day,\\" The Wounded,\\" \\"The Drumhead,\\" and, of course, \\"Redemption.\\" Definitely recommended.
B0053F042G|4.0|Mysterious agent - Jake Glyllenhall,  has to repeatedly go back in time to relive the last minutes of a commuter train before it is destroyed in an explosion. The time window he can go back is limited. When he returns to the present he gives all the information he has deduced to his handlers. All trips back in time begin with him talking to an acquaintance - Michelle Monaghan. The charm factor of the two leads is quite high and probably what makes this movie go down so well. Good thrills and heart felt tragedy as well.<br /><br />Fans of reality based thrillers - please note - the laws of physics, thermodynamics, time, and common sense are rudely violated along the way.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I'm very sad to see this series end. I wish they had made 2 movies out of the other books. For me the magnificent hoary edifice of Hogwarts was always the star of the show. Snape, Hagrid and Dumbledorf a close second. Ron Weasley, Harold Tiberius Potter and Hermione Granger round out the cast of excellence. I say nothing more about this particular movie except that it was great. 4.5 to 5 stars!
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Since there are some 234 comments posted on amazon about this collection, I will only add something not included in this collection.<br /><br />Sara Libby Robinson just published a new study \\"Blood Will Tell,\\" which reveals startling information about Bram Stoker's \\"Dracula.\\" Stoker never identified Dracula as a Jew, but he attached many of the charicatured stereotypes of Jews to him. Dracula had a hooked nose, bushy eyebrows, pointed ears, sharp and ugly fingers, was rootless, of East European origin, dark-complected, and lustful for the money and blood of others. He was loyal only to his own tribe. The only person Dracula uses to help him escape from Britain is a Jew. The myth that Jews drank blood existed in the past and at the time that Stoker wrote his book and is known as the notorious \\"blood libel.\\" It is shocking to add that Bela Lugosi wore a prominently displayed Jewish star around his neck throughout the film.
B003Z2LAAO|3.0|After reviewing many reviews - many negative ones regarding \\"preachy\\" story - I wasn't sure what to expect. Yes, this movie is more about \\"message\\" - conserve water - than featuring 3D graphics, so if you don't like the environmental doom-and-gloom, this probably is not meant for you.  If you're looking for great 3D graphics, I'm afraid it won't meet your expectations either.  However, for $10 in experiencing Blu-ray 3D, I think it's not bad - you do get to experience some 3D graphics, scenery is pretty decent, and while story is preachy, the message is pretty important.
1601251505|5.0|Good quality book that appears to hold up well (unlike the 4th edition books which smudge horribly when you so much as drag a finger across a page).  Comprehensive introduction and reference to the Pathfinder game; essentially includes both the player's handbook and DM's guide all under one cover.  Would've been nice if they included a small bestiary section as well; you know, to let a fledgeling group get started with just this book.  Nevertheless, I think Paizo did a really nice job all-around on this.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|In 2003, Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg alienates most of his classmates when he creates a website comparing the attractiveness of girls on campus. However, a trio of other students are impressed by his technical skills and hire him to create a social networking site. When they discover that Zuckerberg has created a rival site based on the same idea, 'The Facebook', they decide to sue him for intellectual theft. At the same time, as Zuckerberg's fame grows and the site becomes more and more popular, he risks alienating the friends who helped build him the site.    The Social Network is a movie which has a substantial problem: the premise is a very hard sell. The story of Facebook's founding is pretty straightforward: geek hits on winning idea, becomes billionaire, cheeses off a lot of people along the way and gets sued. In order to make a compelling and entertaining movie, the producers decided to bring out the big guns: hire the writer of The West Wing to pen the script, get the director of Fight Club and Se7en to direct, employ the creative force behind Nine Inch Nails to produce the score and finally bring on board a number of the best, promising young American actors of their generation to play the roles. And it more or less works.    David Fincher directs the film like a thriller, using intense close-ups and a steady pace, intercutting between the two court cases in the present and events unfolding on-campus in 2003-04 to give us a clear overview of the situation. He uses some great techniques to make otherwise dull scenes real energy, such as the use of rather bizarre camera techniques whilst the Winklevoss twins row in a boat race to the sound of a crazy cover of Flight of the Bumblebee. He is helped by Sorkin's clever script with its rapid-fire dialogue and cutting insults which may lack realism (were these young people really all that incredibly witty?) but is a lot of fun.    Performances are excellent, particularly Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg, who delivers a controlled, twitchy performance with outbursts of (improbably good) acerbic humour. Armie Hammer plays both of the Winklevoss twins through a combination of CGI and split screen techniques which are flawlessly executed (not being familiar with Hammer's prior work, I genuinely thought they'd hired a pair of twins to play the roles), and his performance is excellent, reaching a height in a scene where the twins confront the president of Harvard and are told to their incredulity that they don't have a leg to stand on as they try to punish Zuckerberg for 'stealing' their idea. Andrew Garfield - the soon-to-be new Peter Parker - is also great as the most sympathetic character in the film, Zuckerberg's best friend Eduardo Severin who is screwed over for no real reason (though note that Severin is the only major player to cooperate with the writing of the book the movie is based on, which may account for this). Justin Timberlake fulfils his early acting potential by playing Sean Parker, the founder of Napster whom Zuckerberg turns to for advice despite Parker's irresponsible reputation, to Severin's disgust.    So, we have a great script, some great actors and a great director. Does this add up to a great movie? Almost. The film is ticking along nicely and is saying some interesting (if somewhat over-familiar) things about fame, avarice and genius when coupled to a strong work ethic but a lack of morality, when it just stops. There's no real climax or a conclusion, the movie suddenly screeches to a halt on a rate trite note: Zuckerberg is told, completely contrary to everything we've seen, that he's not a bad person in an awkward scene that might as well have, \\"PLEASE DON'T SUE US,\\" flashing at the bottom of the screen. This is one of the risks of making a film based on events that are so recent. The Facebook story is still ongoing, and the film simply catches up with the present day and then runs out of plot. No real conclusions are reached, or are indeed reachable, since we are also told that none of the major participants could take part in the movie due to various legal gagging orders and NDAs, meaning a fair amount of guesswork has to go into the story. There's also some rather interesting deviations from the facts for the sake of drama, such as the fact that Zuckerberg had a steady girlfriend for almost the entire timeframe of the events in the movie, but in the film he is presented as a bachelor who is motivated by a bad break-up.    The Social Network (****) almost succeeds in being a modern dramatic version of Seinfeld: a movie about nothing that succeeds thanks to winning scripts, performances and direction. The tremendous creative forces involved make the film as tense and effective as it can be, but at the end of the day there is the feeling that this is a movie which is based on a thin premise. That they make it into such a compelling movie is a tribute to their skills, but the lack of a climax leaves the film feeling a little incomplete. The movie is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).
0756404738|3.0|As a big fan of Name of the Wind, I was looking forward to reading this second entry.  Unfortunately, it's a lot more scattered than the first book and seems to have less relevance in the overall arc of Kvothe's life.  It reads as a collection of 4-5 different adventures, with the latter ones really dragging and a severe lack of continuity between the stories.  I get that he's trying to show Kvothe coming of age, but I felt that was already done better in the first book.  This one spends most of its time covering his journeys exploring romance, sexuality, philosophy, nobility, and martial arts.  The problem is it begins to feel redundant and uninteresting by the time you hit the chapters on sex.  The Adem section was only mildly more interesting, but still not entirely relevant.  It becomes difficult to appreciate and empathize with him, when we're led through the same type of story each time.  We've already watched Kvothe mature--we don't need to keep seeing it over and over in subtly different ways.    I also found that towards the end I lost most of my interest in Kvothe as the character development seemed to tip the scales towards the unbelievable.  He's clearly a prodigy in many things, as is covered in the first book, but we see him accomplish so many incredible feats that it becomes unconvincing--he's never in any real danger anymore.  He overcomes each and every obstacle without there being any real doubt that he'll succeed.  As a result, you never share in his sense of accomplishment with each story.  His near constant struggles in the first book helped lend it much more depth and substance.    I know some authors struggle at times (I'm a big fan of Salvatore, and he had a handful of stinkers before returning to form).  I'm hoping the next entry in Rothfuss' series will be better.  As this is only the second book, it's hard to recommend anyone skipping it, but I think most will be more than a little disappointed by the end of it.

0316113506|5.0|An excellent book-am only part way through it yet but it is very interesting and thought provoking, especially the chapter about childrens sport at school and the imnportance of them all getting excercise-not just standing on the sidelines waiting for a turn to bat or catch a ball.
6304698798|5.0|The `Good the bad and the ugly', is indisputably the best western ever and arguably the best movie of all time. With a genre defining director, cast and score, in a just world this film but for its horse opera image would have garnered a shed load of awards from the opening credits, onwards. Could go on and spoil the effect for the few who have yet to see the final in the Sergio Leonie spaghetti trilogy featuring the relatively unknown Clint Eastwood as the Man with no name. Instead I recommend that you get the box set and watch: `Fistful of dollars' and `For a few dollars more' first. This is how the West was or at least should have been. Anyway all the positive reviewers can't be wrong. Simply put the GBU is a movie right of passage. Icon.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I once learned about a technique in art called deconstruction, it's used when you're looking for a different way to come up with new ideas.     Basically you go back to an earlier time in your artistic development and say \\"OK, we were on this branch of the tree and we made a new branch by going off in this direction. Let's start from this place again and instead let's go off in that direction.\\"     This is deconstructed Yes. They went back to an older lineup (and for one track, an old song) and made new branches. And it's really good work, so it's a very fresh, interesting thing. Not as many catchy hooks as I'd like at times, some of the music is more subtle or a little bit more left of center, but there are enough immediate melodies (Fly From Here part 1, The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be, Into the Storm) that it's not too much of a problem. And the less immediate stuff is still really good. All in all a very different and enjoyable Yes album. It grows on me the more I listen. Definitely worthy of 4 stars.

0894803123|5.0|This is a great first book for the novice homemade ice-cream maker. I just made my first batch of homemade ice-cream on Saturday night using the Sweet Cream Base #1 recipe and I was shocked at how well the ice-cream turned out! The consistency was the exact same as Super Premium ice-cream straight out of the grocery store freezer. My dad has been making ice-cream for several months now, and after trying my batch from the recipe in this book, he even said, \\"Now THIS is what ice-cream is SUPPOSED to taste like!\\" I can't wait to branch out and try some of the other flavors in this book.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I was completely taken back when I first listened to this album and not in a good way... a lot like every single Incubus album I have listned to for the fist time. I'm always hoping for more of the goodness off the previous albums, but I don't find it...right away. Definitely listen to the album a few times. It's just as amazing as all of their other albums. It's light, airy, makes you drift off with a smile on your face. The lyrics as just as good as ever--the real reason we love Incubus, right??? It's missing the rock, which I love and I think if they would have incorporated more of Adolecents' sound into the album it would have been more attractive to new fans as well as the fans waiting for SCIENCE to come back. Regardless, this album is for \\"the fans,\\" not people who don't know and get Incubus like their true fan base. I'm stoked for their tour and I'm stoked they are still making music. Keep it up! :)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I have to say, I loved this book. For only having a 5th grade education , she did a great job.  It is very difficult to read at times but well worth it. It has opened a line of communication between myself and my children. She is a very brave young women.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Honestly, I mean this poor girl/ now women.  I know there are a couple of people who commented on the writing style.  I for one loved that it was written by her. I thought the writing and her words were authentic and I thought that if it had been written by a \\"ghost writer\\" the heart of her would of been lost on paper. On her experience I just cannot find the words to summarize/ or judge because I cannot get my brain around someone living through what she lived through. I also loved how clearly she explained and detailed not only the physical captivity but her mental captivity.  I mean this poor girl lived in a tent!!!!! I just can't comprehend on that of a human being doing that to another.  The progress she has made since her physical realize was really courageous! Bravo Jacyee Dugard!
B0058VW36U|1.0|This game has a lot going for it.  It's cute and accessible with a great hook.  Like angry birds in slot of ways though nowhere near as simple.  Definitely more of cerebral.  But the insane long load times and freezeups on my freshly reset and otherwise fast Samsung vibrant make it too much of a bother to play.  A one star implementation of a five star game.
0375842381|4.0|I enjoyed this trilogy immensely. This definitely isn't the usual tired 'swords & wizards' fantasy. It reads more like old-fashioned science fiction, with alternate worlds, alien beings and worlds almost like our own. It is wonderfully written. There are so many wonderful, densely portrayed characters worlds, it is just captivating.    The reason this series got only 4 stars is that I had some problems with it. First, in some parts there is so much going on that the reader gets lost. Too many minor characters, dead ends, red herrings. Then there's the part about \\"killing God.\\" This provoked a \\"you've got to be kidding' reaction from me. It was just so 'over the top'. Why does all fantasy have to be about universe-shaking events? The more overblown the storyline got, the more my attention began to wander. And what really irritated me was that the same old religious tropes are being recycled after all: prophecies about a miracle child who will save the universe, a replay of the Garden of Eden. We are being preached at, by the author who wants to tell us that the love of two young folks will save the universe from disintegration.  How come everyone has to preach a sermon to me? Mostly what I want from a book is engaging characters, an interesting plot and an escape from mundane reality. Yes, this series did offer all of that. Thumbs up.
0002247399|1.0|Mr. Martin is failing his readers big time! This series is turning into The Wheel Of Time by whats his name Jordan. This seems to be all about the money and his connections to the HBO series. I guess the readers are just considered idiots by the publishers. The last two books of this series are pathetic!

0553801473|4.0|This book similar to all George RR Martin books is brilliantly written.  I continue to have a love hate relationship with most of the major characters.  For example, as much as I detest the character Cersei I began to feel pity for her in this book.  This is the nature and the beauty of the series where no one is completely evil or good.  I think the brilliance of the writing makes the disappointing portions glare more brightly than one would see in an average to above average book.<br /><br />Problem 1, Lists and Lists of useless information. During one visit to the wall almost a full page is dedicated to listing all of the shields that were arrayed on the wall by the family name and crest.  As with so many of the Martin lists the names are rarely ever seen or heard from again.  I have gotten to the point that when I see these lists I usually just read the first and last one.<br /><br />Problem 2, Premature ending.  When I finally arrived at page 1000 I began to feel anxious because I knew Martin could not give me the satisfaction of some resolutions before the book was over with only 100 pages left.  In a series of this nature it is expected that some plot lines will continue unresolved until the next book but in this case Martin left virtually all plot lines unresolved.  I thought this was supposed to fix the problem with Feast of Crows but again I was left wanting.  While writing this review I was tempted to fake satisfaction because the book was still an enjoyable read but it is best to let prospective readers understand the book's limitations.<br /><br />Problem 3, There are still some characters that leave me clueless.  I really don't understand what is going on with Bran.  Martin has spent a lot of ink chronicling Bran's sojourn with mystical undertones but I'll be darn if I have any inkling how this will impact the story line.  What was up with Jon Snow?  He turned from a position of zero intervention with the world of men to a highly political being.  Character disconnects and unresolved story lines abound.<br /><br />One would think that with this critique I would have given the book a lower rating but when evaluated based on the writing merit and the enjoyability factor George RR Martin continues to deliver.  Now if he can just focus on writing some plot resolutions, publish Book 6 withing the next 12 to 18 months and reduce the mundane lists I will find myself completely satisfied.<br /><br />My recommendation is to read it but don't expect it sate your appetite it is merely a morsel to wet your whistle.acter disconnects and unresolved story lines abound.<br /><br />One would think that with this critique I would have given the book a lower rating but when evaluated based on the writing merit and the enjoyability factor George RR Martin continues to deliver.

1400052181|5.0|As much research that I do for alternative medicine, I have never run across this story. It is a must-read for background work.<br />The story is heart-rending and tells of a terrible injustice under the guise of \\"research.\\" I was not aware that once you have anything removed, mole, blood, tissue, it becomes the property of the hospital. There is no \\"permission slip\\" of any kind, so they can do whatever they want with your harvested parts.

0061876755|5.0|William Boyd's ORDINARY THUNDERSTORMS is a thrilling homage to Charles Dicken's OUR MUTUAL FRIEND.  In both novels, the river Thames is a major character to the development of the story.  Boyd also successful develops his plot in a very Dickensian way - with characters turning up in more than one plot line.  It is important to note the Dickens was the master at six degrees of separation long before anyone else thought of it.    This book is an excellent summer read, and Boyd captures much that tells us about the way we live now.  smm
034552554X|3.0|I had mixed emotions about reviewing \\"The Language of Flowers\\"  While I thoughts parts of the book were achingly beautiful, there were other parts that did not add up to a 5 star review.<br /><br />The story of Victoria Jones is told through alternating chapters.  One chapter depicts the abandoned, and emotionally scarred 10 year old Victoria, finally finding a home, after years of neglect in the California foster care system.  She is taken in by a no nonsense but loving single women, Elizabeth, who owns a vineyard and teaches her the language of the flowers.  While Elizabeth and Victoria appear to complete each other, we come to understand that some disaster has driven them apart, and sent Victoria back to foster care.  For me it was the character of Elizabeth who broke my heart. Multifaceted with her own childhood damages, she was by far the more interesting of the two central female characters.<br /><br />The second chapter depicts Victoria on her 18th birthday, when she has been emancipated out of foster care, and is left homeless to live in a park tending to a garden she has planted.  The years in-between have made her even more emotionally unavailable.  Victoria is a plant-whisperer, and comes to realize she has an almost magical ability to match what is missing from a person's life with the correct flower.  Luckily she is given a chance by a neighboring florist to be her assistant.  It is at the flower-market that she meets a male vendor, who also appears to understand the actual language of the flowers.<br /><br />\\"The Language of Flowers\\" was a cross between a Sarah Addison Allen/Alice Hoffman novel and Anne of Green Gables.  While the prose was beautiful and the storyline unique the central character of Victoria did not touch me the way she did most other reviewers.  Victoria appeared to have an angel on her shoulder.  Although sometimes she is her worst enemy, she always lands on her feet.  At 18 years of age, she finds the perfect boss, the perfect job and a perfect man.  Of course her emotional baggage, feelings of self worthlessness and the vicissitudes of life do not make it quite that easy, but this is certainly not \\"Oliver Twist\\".  I also felt the middle of the book tended to drag and the ending felt rushed.  Take away the fascinating language of flowers, the indomitable Elizabeth and for me you are left with chick-literature.  This in itself is not a criticism, as I have given 5 stars to chick-literature which I felt more involved with.Of course her emotional baggage, feelings of self worthlessness and the vicissitudes of life do not make it quite that easy, but this is certainly not \\"Oliver Twist\\".

B004J4WN0I|4.0|This is not quite the same kind of urban fantasy books I'd read previously (Dresden Files, Kate Daniels).  For one, Atticus is an ancient druid who tries to avoid attention, and openly consorts (yes, including sex) with goddesses (note the s).  Also, the gods and goddesses in this setting are immortal, but can be killed.  Personally, I find the story to be quite entertaining and easy to read.  My only gripe is that Atticus seems to overcome his problems too easily.  In the first book, he goes against a god who drew a huge amount of power, a horde of demons, AND a coven of witches, and he won.  Granted he is a 2500 yr old druid with some help, but still, this felt kind of overpowered.

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out and put it on my bookshelf and promptly forgot about it. I pulled it off the shelf to read last week and was instantly transported to another world. It was well written without being stuffy. So refreshing to read something written by someone with full command of the English language and grammar. There was nothing cutesy about it, but it was mesmerizing to me! The story was richly woven and full of detail. An instant classic as far as I'm concerned. I can't wait to read the next thing Diane writes!

0307591549|5.0|I'm not one for self-help books, but after a friend recommended \\"The Happiness Advantage,\\" I took a chance and got it on Amazon. For me what was most telling when reading this book is that normally I am a speed reader-- something like this would normally take me 2-3 days maximum to read on vacation. But I took so many notes and re-read the stories and exercises that it took me about 2 months!<br /><br />What I love most is that the author, Shawn Achor, has a great style of writing and interlaces his own anecdotal examples for many of the sections, making him very relatable. He writes with a sense of humor, and is never condescending in his writing. I've been practicing the exercises recommended in the book for about 2 months now and I've noticed a huge difference. I was a positive person before but it almost felt \\"fake\\"-- now I feel more grateful and proud of my successes at work and at home, and more geniunely happier.<br /><br />Best of luck to those of you who take the leap-- this book shows you that happiness is a choice, it takes work, but it is well worth it.

B002ZG98FU|4.0|As far as romantic comedies are concerned, they really are a dime a dozen and for the most part I could do with the eradication of the entire genre.  For every `When Harry Met Sally' there are a billion Sarah Jessica Parker/Jenifer Lopez/Freddie Prince Jr. debacles that it becomes overwhelming just looking at the movie posters clogging the theater with film after film after film promising the same premise with the same actors botching up the same scripts.<br /><br />Gag me.<br /><br />But, with all of that madness circulating the local theater, there was one particular rom/com (as they are affectionately referred to) that looked so incredibly dull and yet wound up kind of blowing me away.  That isn't to say that it is without the curse of the clich&eacute;, but `Morning Glory' kind of owns it every step of the way and delivers a really fun and entertaining ride that didn't make me feel guilty for one second.  I kind of loved it (kind of) and wish that more rom/com's would find the same fresh mixture of witty dialog and capable actors.  That is really what makes `Morning Glory' surpass the competition, for it really understands how to make something so predictable dumb feel smart and infectious.  The cast of characters are well handled by their actors and the screenplay gave enough one-liners with bite to the cast so that they could grab hold of us with wit and charm and really make us WANT to watch them.<br /><br />Can we all just bow in the presence of Diane Keaton for a moment.  Seriously, this woman has had her ups and downs with many (including me) and I often find her breed of manic comedic timing to be overcooked and detrimental to her own talent (which is undeniable).  I prefer her when she's serious because she doesn't try to hard (where was that Oscar for her in 1981, when her `Reds' performance toppled over her fellow nominees?).  Striking such an appropriate balance, Keaton lets her hammy tendencies sell every ounce of character that Colleen Peck possesses.  She attacks this performance like a beast and because of that she winds up the very best thing that could have happened to this movie.<br /><br />Yes, Rachel McAdams and sweet and charming (she does rom/com better than Amy Adams) and Harrison Ford is adorably grouchy and Patrick Wilson has great abs, but at the end of the day it is Diane Keaton that runs away with every scene with her biting delivery.<br /><br />There is no escaping the eventualities of the genre though.  The relationship troubles thanks to the overworked is present, even if the relationship McAdams's character has with Wilson's isn't given the time of day to begin with (so unimportant so why should we care if they breakup to makeup), and the overall dynamic and eventual decisions made between McAdams's character and that of Harrison's can be seen a mile away...and still, this film just works!<br /><br />I can't complain.  For what this film was reaching for, it nailed it.  And to be honest, in a sea of drek disguised as `feel good entertainment', `Morning Glory' feels very much like its name suggests; glorious!ce like a beast and because of that she winds up the very best thing that could have happened to this movie.    Yes, Rachel McAdams and sweet and charming (she does rom/com better than Amy Adams) and Harrison Ford is adorably grouchy and Patrick Wilson has great abs, but at the end of the day it is Diane Keaton that runs away with every scene with her biting delivery.    There is no escaping the eventualities of the genre though.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I started reading this series recently, so I did not have to endure years of waiting between books.  This probably makes me less annoyed about the extraneous bloat, found particularly in the first half of the book, that seems to have put off many of the other reviewers. And yes, there are cliffhangers. But there have been cliffhangers in all the other installments so it's not a huge surprise that the author resorted to more of the same.  And with 2 more books scheduled in the series, the next one is also unlikely to bring resolution to most of the story lines.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the majority of the story. Do I wish I knew more of what happens to everyone? Do I wish that the first half of the book was pared down by thoughtful editing? Do I wonder exactly where the author is going with this? Do I hope I don't have to wait 5 years until the next one is published? Do I wish I had my own dragon? Yes, yes, yes, yes and yes! But it was still a worthwhile read, and I look forward to the finding out what is next in store to these interesting and flawed characters (and the dragons...)
B000003TAL|3.0|It is not my intention to negatively criticize this at all since this is not a bad record. The enigma for me is that this is supposed to be a ground-breaking, landmark work and I just don't get it.<br /><br />I like \\"Sonic Youth\\", they're a cool band. I like the sound, respect the different approach with the guitars and love, love their bass player (she's so sexy and cool and confident and creative and charismatic).<br /><br />While recognizing that this can be a daring band, I can only take Sonic Youth in bits and pieces. Too much of this band is too much of music that is not always that palatable. Their perfect when they make the rounds on the late night talk shows. You hear one song and they come across amazing.<br /><br />Daydream Nation is a sprawling work that has too much avante garde and not enough melody. Ironically, when they do a more conventional song it comes across weaker than something more daring yet tuneful. This band is best when they find the balance between noise and dissonance with melody and good songwriting.<br /><br />Maybe this band should be applauded for taking a far more adventerous path than their cohorts.<br /><br />There are flashes of brilliance, some good songs, and challenging art in \\"Daydream Nation\\". It's just too much for repeated listening.

0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay takes the story out of the arena and into a vicious and brutal war between the Districts and the Capitol. However, not all is how it seems. There are those who are even supposedly on the good side, that have their own agenda. Events transpire that showcase the brutality of war and Collins must be applauded for her depiction of these horrors.<br /><br />The book is unique in that we are not completely surrounded by a world controlled by the Capitol or in an arena fighting to stay alive with the Tributes. This may case some disorientation but in all honesty, getting out of the arena and into the thick of the conflict is a nice breather (in a sense). Katniss is further developed and we get a better understanding of her choices and reluctance to let herself become romantically involved with either Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />At one point in the novel, Gale mentions that Katniss will eventually choose the person she thinks she can't survive without. In a way, this impresses on the reader that Katniss never really wanted to be a hero of the rebellion and rally people to the cause. She's always been interested in preserving herself and the one's that she loves. This is what makes her a real, identifiable character.<br /><br />Colllins isn't the best writer but she is able to develop her main characters well and provide enough social commentary to make for a very interesting and worthwhile read. Fans of dystopian novels will naturally gravitate towards the story and embrace the many controversial twists of this last entry. Fans of flawless happy endings need not apply.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|I never saw BSG when it originally aired on TV but was recently drawn to it after a friend told me it was amazing. I bought this complete series DVD-set, Season 1 to Season 4.5, and have been glued to my TV ever since. I thought I'd space it out and watch an episode every few days. Was I wrong. It's *impossible* not to watch one episode after the other because of the cliffhangers. I was engrossed, spellbound and cared deeply for all the characters. This is the greatest series I've ever seen on American television. Perfection across the board: Writing, Directing, Cinematography, Design/make-up and Acting--every element is sublime.    I've often said that the BBC 'Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' and 'Smiley's People,' both starring Alec Guinness, are my idea of flawless TV. Those George Smiley stories, and the BBC series 'The Jewel in the Crown,' have been my standards for series excellence. I couldn't imagine seeing anything as great as those again. However, 'Battlestar Galactica' now joins my tiny list of television series transcendence. Bravo and Standing O for everyone involved.     For discerning fans, this DVD set includes Razor, the story of The Pegasus. The quality and extras on these DVDs are perfect. I can't imagine wanting more.
B000JIHP88|3.0|My 3 month old son loves this Mobile, but mechanically it leaves a lot to be desired.  The leaves often get jammed in the down position which stops the animals from circling.  I had to rig the leaves so that they stay in the up position.  This allows the animals to circle freely.  It stays on for about 15 minutes which is just right for us.  The volume is really low, but since it's so close to the baby's head, I think this is a good thing.  I recommend it because I searched high and low for a bright rainforest mobile and this was, by far, the most attractive option.  And, again, my son really likes it.

The Hero of Ages wrapped everything up and gave me a great sense of satisfaction! If you haven't read the series yet, you should!    PS be warned if you're an avid fantasy reader you won't be able to get much done while reading this series, it literally ate up 95% of my free time!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|this game is amazing, which makes its terrible performace on the T-mobile Sensation so much worse. awful graphics, sluggish gameplay, and frequent loading screens that result in random pauses, not to mention the havoc its been wreaking on my phone OS!

B003ZSH606|5.0|I had looked around the net for news of a new Jamiroquai a couple of years ago and read up on JK and the trouble with Sony, specifically that Sony had wanted to peg Jamiroquai as a dance-oriented band or limit their sound, and JK wasn't happy. Well, I wasn't either. It isn't that the 2001 and 2005 weren't good, they were just pretty restricted, and that betrayed they're initial sound. They are good at straight dance music (pop-trance), but listening to their early work, you can see they were always much more, and had been narrowed and confined into a place they didn't want to be, and when JK said they were at work making the kind of album the band wanted to do again, I held out a lot of hope for what became Rock Dust Light Star.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to a album with wide ranging style and feel like Travelling Without Moving or The Return of the Space Cowboy. I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED, and neither will you.<br /><br />I don't get why anyone seriously a fan of the band would give this less than 4 stars. Crazy...<br /><br />Rock Dust Light Star moves from style to style over 12 (my custom reburn is 13... includes the Smile track from Facebook) but never loses its coherence as a Jamiroquai album, and feels, as a work, very similar to my favorite album of theirs... Travelling Without Moving (1996).<br /><br />Want dance tracks?  White Knuckle Ride (the cd maxi single has five excellent tracks, BTW), She's a Fast Persuader and Hey Floyd<br /><br />Want a more natural sound?  Rock Dust Light Star, Hurtin', Blue Skies, Two Completely Different Things, Never Gonna Be Another<br /><br />Want more of a disco style?  Smoke and Mirrors, All Good in The Hood, Smile (Download it off Facebook - free track)<br /><br />The album moves from style to style without losing the classic Jamioquai feel. I love the whole vibe of this album, and highly, HIGHLY recommend it to three groups of people:  1) any longtime Jamiroquai fan, 2) any fan of their early albums that maybe didn't like their later work like Dynamite or A Funk Odyssey as much, and 3) especially to someone who HASN'T listened to the band before.<br /><br />Their newest work is actually a good intro to what the band is about. If you want a dance album, an acid jazz album, or a disco album, look elsewhere.  If you want a Jamiroquai album, buy Rock Dust Light Star.ey as much, and 3) especially to someone who HASN'T listened to the band before.

0439023521|2.0|In search of the next Harry Potter I tried this series, though I am sad to say it fell short.     At times the story was an enjoying read, but all the inconsistensies in the story kept annoying me. I actually read the entire series to perhaps get an explanation (as it is in fact critically acclaimed), but that never happened, and Im left with a feeling af wasting 30$ and hours of reading.    It is hard to be spesific without pointing out the quite simply illogical action, so if you are new to the series stop reading here    **SPOILERS** (a few from book 3 also)    - The writer fails to explain why the hunger games is in fact a workable scheme. I am really quite aware of what human beings can do to each other (eg. WW2 eastern front + holocaust, as probable low points..), but usually evil doing happens for a reason, and getting kids to kill each other for fun, and make the parents watch and celebrate the event is really just a recipe for a major uprising (it just doesnt make sense to use it to control the districts as the writer claims).    - When the kids are picked you would get a lot of them refusing to just play along and smile to the cameras, though that didnt happen here. Why? I found battle royal way more credible in that sense.    - In the arena there are cameras literally everywhere. With such technology the capitol would have little trouble to follow every move of Katniss and the other rebels after the games, and uncover their scheme.    - After the games, every credible dictator would have Katniss killed. It would be so easy to let her have a \\"hunting accident\\" while out in the woods. Just get a few shots of her out in the forbidden woods and air it with pictures of the corpse; problem solved (silly little girl got herself killed while doing illegal hunting).    - In book 3 it gets worse (Katniss shooting down high-tech choppers with a bow and arrow wtf?; the capitol using bunker busters on dc 13.. why not send off one every 3 hours to shut down the entirerebellion? it just doesnt make sense that they send like 4 busters then quit; why doesnt the capitol fire nukes when they get exterminated?; why use nets as traps in the street in the capitol? every decent insurgeon in Iraq knows a couple of 155mm shells is vastly superior to a net!)    OK I could go on and on.. In short; the book just isnt credible enough, and the main characters are too shallow to be interesting.

038572179X|3.0|Very well written...but dense.     This took me forever to read in spurts on the exercise bike at the gym. Basically, a young girl with literary aspirations and an amazing gift for fantasy ruins the lives of her sister and her sisters lover. After serving time, the lover goes to war. The stories during the war have pace, keeping the pages turning. But the introspective thoughts of Briony are tiresome...but important. It's her inner dialouge that allows as to see how she changes and matures throughout the narrative.     Nevertheless, it's a heavy read.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I might come off as cold, but I am also an avid reader myself. However, I just couldn't continue with the book after reading through the first few chapters as I thought that it was so boring and painful. I decided to skip to the ending and read about her so called released but however find it particularly odd. I understand that she was suffering from a psychotic breakdown and whatever, but also find her emotions and descriptions seemingly odd and unfitting. I guess before we start feeling sorry for Jaycee's so called \\"stolen\\" life, we should maybe consider the possibilities that there are \\"stories\\" behind this so called pathetic kidnapping story.
B004A8ZX2S|4.0|I went with my wife and another couple.  All of us are around sixty.  Interestingly enough,I was the only one that really liked the film.  The other three had criticisms,one even said this is the type of film you should smoke weed before seeing!  However,the four of us went to eat afterwards and had fun intensely discussing the films and our own reflections for an over an hour.  How many films have you watched and five minutes after walking out of the theater you are discussing something else?  This is a very thought provoking film and for some who had similarities in their own upbringing in the fifties, it will hit home hard.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|If you're not looking to overclock but are looking for spectacular cooling at a cheap price then look no further. I upgraded to this heatsink/fan from the stock Intel cooling fan and core temperatures immediately dropped by 5C. The fan blows HARD but absolutely silent, and the heat dissipation is incredible. Hot air goes straight out the back, without hovering around in the case at all. It also comes with a little tube of cpu paste, as well as an extra pair of fan attachment pieces, in case you plan to set up a second fan.    The setting up is a HUGE pain in the ass if you already have your pc set up, not going to lie. The odd size of the unit requires you to screw a large inconvenient piece onto the back of the motherboard, my case unfortunately has a sealed back meaning I had to disassemble everything and pull the motherboard up to attach the unit. However it was totally worth it in the end.     I would STRONGLY recommend this product.

B004SGWYW4|5.0|Let see were can i start, this anime is one of the best zombie anime series that I have ever seen. I think its the only Zombie animated series out there.  I like how the charaters dont take themselves serious all the time and that brings out the comedy element of the series. I really like the first disc because it really focused on survival and how the students were going to get out of the school alive the second disc kind of focus more on comedy and sex but the action and violence was still there. Overall great anime good series especially for zombie fans after watching this i think CAPCOM should make and Japanese Animated Resident Evil series now but with less comedy, I know I would buy it thats for sure, as long as it is with characters from the game though.
0553801473|2.0|I have to agree with pretty much most of the other low rated comments. The book is mush, it is mostly filler, and is a pretty big waste of time. As someone else pointed out, they could have combine A Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons, kept the book to 500-600 pages and made a decent book. However they cut it into two 1000ish page jumble-fests that left you wanting on both ends. Even with the big cliff hangers he tries to lure you to continue with, I have lost nearly all interest in continuing this series.
B00000JHAU|5.0|If You're Feeling Sinister was one of the most successful products of Great Britain's chamber/twee pop scene, but most importantly it was one of the first albums to describe a different outlook on the life of nineties' youth. Rather than the bleak and nihilistic portrait of life that grunge and other of the band's contemporaries popularized, the album shows the other side of the coin, specifically the delicate sensibility and repressed attitude that another portion of the crowd could relate to. The music is brilliantly layered in order to expose this way of life; on the outlook it is innocent and laid back, reminiscent of the naivety of first social experiences and anxious feelings, highlighted by light strings and delicate horns and piano, and of course Murdoch's breathy, calm vocals reminiscent of Nick Drake. But just as Nick Drake hid his opaque messages behind his soft voice almost 25 years before them, so does Belle & Sebastian throughout the record. A close listen reveals themes of alienation, unrequited love and hopelessness.<br /><br />It goes to show that both sides of the coin, one representing the youth that grunge portrayed and indie pop representing the counterpart, share the same emotional connection; whats different is the way those feelings fit the performer. Coupled with a love for narration and literary passages, the album gives the band the upper-hand with respect to other contemporary chamber/twee pop acts, crafting an original and relatable set of songs. Many times Scotland is under-appreciated in terms of music with England, but in the late 80s and mid 90s, producing masterful pop iconoclasts like Cocteau Twins, Jesus & Mary Chain, and of course the leading Belle & Sebastian, it is essential to recognize the high level of talent and music culture that was being produced.

B00000AFFF|5.0|One of the most brilliant and yet unlikely collaboration of songwriters, it seemed that Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach were brought together by luck rather than preparation. The initial product of their reunion was set to be exclusively a single - \\"God Give Me Strength\\", for the soundtrack to the 1996 film Grace of My Heart. Yet after an outstanding result the duo decided to strike back with a whole set of songs with the same successful formula; orchestrated, modern torch ballads with a sensitive focus on unrequited love and loss. The result was the one and only album Painted From Memory; not only a late career burst in both of the composers careers, but also one of the rare gems to come out of the late nineties.<br /><br />At the time the recording process started around mid 1995, both artist were at the lowpoint of their careers; Costello have had a string of disappointing albums since 1989 Spike, while Bacharach had not penned a successful composition since 1985 \\"Thats What Friends Are For\\". The reality is that what both artists had in common was hunger to revive their success, and timing couldn't have been better. Firstly, Costello had just ended a rather troublesome relationship with Warner Bros, allowing him to have a fresh start. Secondly, with the rise of alternative music in the mainstream there was a renewed interest in Bacharach's material, as many artists from Oasis to Air held him as inspiration. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the music industry was yet to be flooded by the explosion of teen pop and boy bands; on the mean time there was a high interest for orchestrated material since the success of chamber/twee pop acts, such as Tindersticks and Belle & Sebastian, gave the public a rennovated interest in the genre.<br /><br />Upon listening to the record, the compositions have a timeless quality at first impression; it recalls the grandeur and flair of the past era most related to the best known compositions of Bacharach/David, thanks to the arrangements of the former, while portraying a melancholic, passive aggression towards love throughout Costello's lyrics. However the material is not affected by the deficiencies of both artists; Bacharach does not overdo it to the point it becomes muzak, while Costello is not make the material overly complex for its own good. Instead both artist complement each other to exploit only their strengths. Noticeably, the songs do not sound outdated or misplaced at any moment of the record; from beginning to end it flows as a personal music statement, tasteless of any trend.<br /><br />Musically it is not revolutionary; the record is rather formulaic in that sense. However the duo does not overuse it at any point of the album, but rather shape it into many different passages. The originality of the album, in that sense of the word, comes from the fact that Costello croons throughout the record, and does it rather masterfully. I believe the duo noticed that the best that could come from using the torch ballad formula could only go so far, that may have been why they were wise enough to not push their boundaries and they released a single album.

0553801473|1.0|Run, don't walk, as far away from this latest installment of the Song of Fire and Ice. Considering that Mr. Martin took 6 years to come up with this novel, you'd think that there would actually be something redeeming and interesting about it. However, what he has managed to deliver is essentially a 1000 page bad \\"Seinfeld\\" episode. Nothing happens. At all. Its a meandering book about people meandering around and having political discussions, complainig about the conditions of their current physical environment or endlessly describing their food.<br /><br />The characters do not grow, no situations get resolved, and the \\"new\\" characters do little to advance the novel beyond adding pages and pages of exposition. I say \\"new\\" because one of them is simply a re-named character who wasn't interesting enough to be a full-blown POV character in the earlier books, and now we get a lot of material on why he has a new name and his own inner monologue about his new identity.<br /><br />This reads less like \\"the other part of A Feast for Crows\\", and more like stuff salvaged from the cutting room floor that the editors pulled out of A Feast for Crows as being too boring and non-relevant. This is one of the very few books where it will be better to wait until HBO tackles the book to see if they can somehow distill 1000 pages of ennui into a couple coherent episodes.<br /><br />Use whatever terms you like: \\"jumping the shark\\", \\"abandoning the fans\\", \\"phoning it in\\", \\"resting on his laurels\\", \\"contractually obligated to write a book, but not contractually obligated to put any effort or quality into the product\\". This is awful and huge disservice to his legions of fans who have made him a wealty man. Its like he and George Lucas made a bet on who could put out the worst material that their fans would actually pay for. Lucas was in the lead with The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, but Martin is pulling neck and neck with A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />Save your money!

0385334206|5.0|From the time I was in high school and given the opportunity to read one of Vonnegut's books, I was inspired. My view of the world was and still is changed. This BOC or \\"Blue Monday\\" is an eye-opening, shocking, and truthful book of a picture of our society post-Vietnam. KV is a true philosopher and honest fellow of our century. Not only is this book wonderful, the characters and the side stories for each of them are captivating for the reader. Once you read BOC or any of KV's novels, you will become enchanted and hooked.    KV changed my life and put into words so many abstract thought I could never had vocalized on my own. I never met the man before he passed, but in my eyes and my heart, I know him as the man who gave me something to believe in. Other People.
B0053YEM7U|5.0|Briefly - I was very apprehensive about purchasing FFH due to not being wild about new material from Yes in a while but after listen to the samples, I went for it. I am pleasantly surprised at how good this recording is, songs are good, production is fantastic and playing is as good or better (particularly Steve Howe) than it has been in a long while.     In all honesty - I do not miss Jon Anderson on this, David Benoit (sp)does a great job!! It is my favorite new Yes recording since Talk.    I just hope now they hit the stage and perform some of this - I stopped going to see YES because they rarely play anything new.

B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was still curious after the Dianne Sawyer show so I bought a Kindle copy of Dugard's account of her capture and imprisonment. Not having the account closely edited by a professional helped her story in that we could hear a woman who was still in many ways a young girl. Confusion exists between Sawyer's account and Dugard's account of how Dugard was finally given her freedom. Dugard says that her identity is revealed when the family goes with the captor to register with his parole officer. On tv we see the family on a university campus being interviewed by the campus police. Which is correct?
0553801473|2.0|If you have read all the previous books, expect another AFFC in term of general plot development and satisfying resolutions (not much).<br />If you are new to the series I can only recommend to wait at least till the next book or even better till the end of the series.<br /><br />First three books were great and I would recommend them to anyone who has nothing to read, because they are very good by themselves.<br />The last two volumes - \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" are not that great. Almost nothing is really happening to move the plot ahead. You can get through them on a momentum gained from the first books, but if the series are never finished (Martin began to write them in 1991, so do your math) it will be just a waste of time and a source of disappointment.
B003Y74AZ2|3.0|This case has been pretty good for me as I just wanted something small for added protection of my iPhone 4. The good thing is that it seems to provide adequate protection from slipping and falling. I can set it on an uneven surface and my phone will not slip.    As for the negatives: it is kind of flimsy around the edges and does not hold real tight on the sides and bottom. However, I have not had any problems with the case coming off unless I intentionally try to remove it.     This item could be improved by somehow making it tighter, using some kind of harder material, or reinforcing the sides, but with the same soft feeling.
0062060554|2.0|I read some of the reviews about this book and thought it was going to be a page turner.  I was totally wrong, this book is EXTREMELY repetitive, the first 300 pages were the same thing over and over, and there was no suspense.  The book finally got to the nitty gritty with about 50 pages left and then it started to get interesting.    Overall if your looking for a good book you cannot put down, look elsewhere.

0061537934|5.0|This is the first book that I have read by Garth Stein. It is a wonderful story! It is a quick read (I read the entire book - cover to cover - in less than two weeks). The narrator is the family dog, 'Enzo'. Enzo is about as lovable a character as you could ever ask for. Seeing human life through the eyes of a dog provides a very interesting perspective. I highly recommend this book!
1416585710|1.0|This book is definately a miss from Stephen King.  I tried reading this book and it was like pulling teeth.  The book is about the wife of a famous novelist who died at a young age.  It is an account of her past life with her husband and her current life.  Part of the story revolves around her digging through her husband's manuscripts and the connection they have to the deep dark memories that she forced herself to repress.  Finally she is stalked and attacked by a crazy fan as she starts to learn more and more about her own husband's dark secrets, as well as his obsessive, violent behavior.    My first complaint about the book is how slow moving it was.  The book truthfully went nowhere fast.  The plot took forever to develop and really presented nothing new to Stephen King's works.  Secondly, the use of random made up words as part of Lisey's \\"code words\\" from her marraige was very annoying.  I did not find it creative or cute, I just found it irritating.. Lastly the plot was very convoluted.  There were several stories going on at once, all of them progressing at snail's pace and going nowhere.    I think this book is a definate skip or at least a library rental.  This one was pretty torturous to read and was absolutely brutal to get through.

Anyways I like it,.

0061784788|5.0|Did you know that the USA was founded on a lie?  Did you realize that the government, while not correcting that same mistake has continued that lie?<br /><br />Rollins' new book explores the foundation of the United States while exploring what some have called \\"the White Indians\\", an extinct tribe that have more Indo-European features that those of the Native Americans.  Who were these people, and what did they have to do with Merriweather Lewis and Thomas Jefferson?  How did they fit into the founding of the United States?  And why did they have an ancient language and draw maps on buffalo hides?  What is the message they have left for us today?<br /><br />Mr. Rollins has scored yet another perfect 10!
0553801473|1.0|Everything that happens to each character can be summed up in a sentence or two. Nothing of real consequence happens. Editting is terrible. A long thought dead character is pulled in out of GRRM's bottom while characters we have invested in go nowhere. This book is a ripoff and copout by GRRM. No cliffhangers resolved, but more are added. No prophecies fulfilled, but more are added. I can't believe I was stupid enough to wait for nearly 6 years for this rubbish. It feels like he wrote most of it last month in a rush with no time for it to get properly editted.<br /><br />I believe this will be the last book in this series. It is obvious GRRM cannot control his characters and plot anymore and I truly think he has grown to hate writing this series. He brands himself as an American Tolkein, but he's NOT EVEN CLOSE. He's more like a combo of Robert Jordan/Chris Carter/ JJ Abrams (read Wheel of Time/X-files/LOST). The only way we see the end of this is if HBO gets the rights to finish on screen and I hope it happens that was rather than letting GRRM mess it up more.
B0058VW36U|5.0|great game!  especially when u r trying to get that last star and u have to try over and over.  It's fun and challenging
B0015AARJI|5.0|It came when it was said to and it was in the official packaging that it would come in at the stores for twice as much it was a great buy.
0739384198|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the series, and this book did not disappoint. The first two books in the series seemed to be more of a thriller type, and this last novel was slightly more action. I appreciate how Stieg Larsson infused the book with Swedish culture, so you really get a sense of what the daily life is like.<br /><br />It's nice to have the cd's as backup, and upload them to your iPod/iPhone as well. I definitely recommend the series if you like edgy thrillers, and why not pop into your car to liven up your road trip or daily commute?
B00364K6YW|4.0|I love it, It's a great story of love. I also read the book and it conserves all the details. Really I recomend it.

142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero is full of unimaginable events so thrilling you will never be able to put the book down. I myself stayed up till midnight reading this great book. The start makes you ponder about a boy named Jason losing his memory and it stays in your mind about who he really is. Anyway this award winning, best selling book I recommend for   any age of readers. Again, don't be surprised when you realize its 3 in the morning and you're halfway through the book!
B004A5EWZK|5.0|Purchased this series for my grown daughter as a gift.  She's a real fan of The Tudors and watched every episode on air but really wanted her own set to watch whenever she wanted.  She absolutely loves these dvds and watches them all the time; she's very happy with them.
0736092269|3.0|I read very positive reviews about this book before purchasing and had high expectations from it. It turned out to be just a list of exercises and their specific anatomical actions. Some tips and tricks here and there regarding sport injuries and performance but that's about that. I own other books such as The Bodybuilding Encyclopedia by Arnold Schwarzenegger which I felt gave me more bang for my buck. Arnold's book contains muscle maximizing technique, nutrition, and philosophy of the sport, it's a lot better. This book does not contain any new information that does not exist in the Arnold book, but instead it is less informative and concernes only with what the title talks about.. basic anatomy which could be learned by playing around with a human body anatomical model.     I did however like the drawings in this book, they're fantastic and well detailed.    All in all I don't regret buying this book but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone who already have the Arnold book or Power Training by Muscle and Fitness. All the information in this book is wildly available online and unless you're training to become a fitness instructor you might not need it.
030726999X|5.0|This is the third of the Stieg Trilogy, that should be read as a set...This is a well planned and thought out Mystery Thriller that takes us into the world of preconceived notions about looks and emotional health and political intrigue to the tune of the Bourne series.  Some might stumble as it is a lengthy set, each book about 600 pages, but a great vacation read.  I stumbled a bit with the vast introductions of Swedish governmental bodies and names and places from Sweden but by book three got most of the characters straight.  This is a monumental feat for Stieg and I really wish this were the first of many, not the last of his works.  I'm a nurse with Psych leanings and avid CSI mystery fan and this was the best of the best read I've read in many a year...
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Nothing gets done.  This book could have been 500 pages if GRRM, the author, combined all of Jon Snow's story lines, how many separate times do we need to read about Wildlings coming through the Wall? And Dany's story lines, how many times do we need to read about Dany wondering what to do to keep peace in Mereeen? And who cares about Mereen anyway?  She's lived to conquer Westeros again but that's all on hold to marry some slimy guy in Mereen who can keep the peace there.  Gimme a break.  The 3 biggest game-changer characters in the book, the 3 dragons, are locked up or gone wild for most of the book.
0553801473|2.0|I loved the first three books in this series, but it took a turn for the worse in book #4 AFFC.  Unfortunately book #5 ADWD was also pretty disappointing.<br /><br />Not enough progress in the main plots, while entirely too much time spent on extraneous story arc's, and painfully tedious chapters describing minute details of characters we have little reason to care about.<br /><br />I had hoped ADWD would be a return to what I liked about this series but ended up being more frustrated and don't really see myself buying book 6 until the whole series is finished and I can get them all for bargain basement pricing, and just skim over all the meaningless stuff.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|If you could bring back the horror of every original scary movie made and combine it into one. this is it.  Poltergist, Exorcist, The entity and more in one great film.
1607882302|5.0|Admittedly, this type of book is one of my favorites and so I read quite a few.  I've read books by Kemmons Wilson (Holiday Inn hotels), Howard Schultz (Starbucks), Ray Kroc (McDonalds), etc... One of my other favorites was by Conrad Hilton of Hilton Hotels. But this one really hits home.  As a software developer and budding entrepreneur I can really connect with Tony Hseih's background and his desire to create a tangible company that provides value instead of yet another built-to-flip company.  Highly recommended!

B004WPYNY8|5.0|SYMPHONY X CALL NEW JERSEY THEIR HOME AND IT'S BEEN NEARLY FOUR YEARS SINCE THE LAST RELEASE, \\"PARADISE LOST\\". MANY PEOPLE THINK THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF PARADISE AND I WOULD AGREE, BUT I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS DOUBLE CD BETTER. I THINK THE SONGS ARE STRONGER, HEAVIER AND LESS SYMPHONIC AND MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH SOME SONGS HAVING SOME CATCHY SOUNDING HOOKS. I'VE BEEN LISTENING TO THESE GUYS SINCE THE 90'S AND THEY SOUND BETTER WITH EACH ALBUM. I WAS LISTENING TO MICHAEL ROMEO(SONGWRITER/GUITARIST)ON A YOU TUBE INTERVIEW AND HE SAYS IT TAKES THEM A YEAR TO RECORD A CD. HE ALSO MENTIONED TOURING FOR TWO YEARS FOR PARADISE LOST SO THEY TOUR QUITE A BIT AND I IMAGINE IT COULD BE ANOTHER THREE-FOUR YEARS FOR THEM TO RECORD ANOTHER CD. BUT FEAR NOT SYMPHONY FANS BECAUSE IF YOU GET THE LIMITED DIGIPACK CD, YOU'LL GET OVER 80+ MINUTES OF PURE PROGRESSIVE METAL AT IT'S FINEST. WITH THE DEATH OF RONNIE JAMES DIO, I THINK RUSSELL ALLEN IS ONE OF THE BEST VOCALIST IN PROG METAL. WHILE I ADMIT NOT TO WRITING MANY REVIEWS, I FELT COMPELLED TO TELL FANS THAT THIS CD IS REALLY INCREDIBLE AND THEY WILL ALWAYS BE IN MY TOP THREE OF FAVORITE PROG BANDS OF ALL TIME! AS A GUITARIST FOR OVER 30+ YEARS OF PLAYING EXPERIENCE, I FEEL MICHAEL ROMEO KEEPS RAISING THE BAR FOR HIS INCREDIBLE STYLE AND TECHNIQUE, AND HE'S REALLY A HUMBLE GUY, WHICH IS AMAZING IN THE MUSIC BUSINESS. ALL PROGRESSIVE METAL FANS, BUY THIS CD!
1451629184|5.0|I have never written a book review...frankly, I haven't sat thru a book and read it cover to cover since college (which is embarrasing to admit, but it is the truth). However, something pulled me towards this book and her story since she was discovered in 2009.     It took me less than a day to read this and I too had a hard time putting it down. The first 1/4 of the book is very, very difficult to get thru in one sitting. I found myself having to put it down several times as the raw emotion you will feel is overwhelming. You can't help but put yourself in her experience as well as thinking of what you would do if other loved ones in your family had been abducted and thrust into this life. For me, it was my 4 year old niece...the thought of a sicko taking her and doing this to her was truely painful to fathom.     I am Jaycee's age and I think that also played a part in my experience with this book. She mentions several times the feelings of \\"missing out\\" on certain milestones in life and it really makes you appreciate all those things in your life that may not of worked out \\"perfectly\\", but yet you are still afforded those experiences...these experiences Jaycee never had.     The down to earth perspective this young woman has is heroic. Yes, she speaks often of animals and as a none animal lover, this really didn't bother me. Jaycee takes you back to the mind of an 11 year old and progresses you to her present age. It is impressive given her 5th grade education. I am also glad she did not use a ghost writer, I believe her message would of been skewed. She writes this book as if you are in her shoes and that is what makes it so incrediably powerful.     My heart was broken for her for much of the book, but in the end she turns this into a true miracle of strength and dare I say it, a happy ending. Which I found to be impossible when I first began to read it. The biggest message I took from this book is we are all dealt a hand in life, sometimes fair, sometimes not fair... and it's not the hand we are dealth that matters, but how we handle it. I will never forget her story. Ever.
B002ZNJW0O|3.0|Saying that the story isn't well told isn't entirely true - the first 90% of this book moves at a nice pace with a great amount of detail.  The book then climaxes and is wrapped up in 4-5 short chapters (10 pages or so).  From the climax to the end there wasn't a lot of detail and there were a lot of unanswered questions.  It was disappointing to have such an abrupt ending to a story that was told so nicely otherwise.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|Great music and I'm glad I finally found a version that didn't have the talking all through the songs. It's nice sometimes to hear what was going on but I think they interrupt the music too much in the remastered version. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and listen.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|'Black Swan' is a pseudo-psychological thriller exploring the depths of depraved and demented behaviors. I can't recall when I last viewed a film so unpleasant. Only after several weeks have I been able to get these few lines down, so obviously it's had an impact on my sensibilities.    Perhaps one day I might watch again and attempt to determine if the film at all has any redeeming social and personal value.    Until then, we're looking at one star only--and that because of the photography and special effects.     Russell de Ville  18 July 2011

0307272702|5.0|There are a lot of books about how to lose weight. But losing weight is not a reason you might want to read this book. The things I like about this book is that it talks about \\"WHY\\" we get fat. It's not all about how much we eat and not about how much we exercise. Obesity is caused by fat regulation disorders. And, the cause of the disorder is carbohydrate we consume over time.  This book takes you down the the deeper level of what carbohydrate do to our fat and muscle cells.    It sounds too technical for most people, isn't it? But it's not. The authors, for most parts, use common medical terms that we heard when we do annual check-up such as cholesterol or tri-glyceride. By the way, if you'd like to know why \\"tri-glyceride\\" is call \\"tri-glyceride\\", you have to read this book.

0553801473|1.0|Don't get me wrong.  I loved books one, two and three.  LOVED them. After reading book four, I had a strong feeling that Martin was going off the deep end. Chapter after chapter of crap I didn't care about, hundreds of pages of back story download, useless information, useless characters, gobs of side stores and adventures only to finally culminate in disaster for EVERYONE I DID care about.<br /><br />Still I had hope. I thought ... this HAS to get better.<br /><br />So on to book five. The first quarter of the book is a trial. Again, hundreds of pages of back story blather, much of it about characters that were minor in the first books, but suddenly are the central figures in the series ... for no apparent reason.  Theon Greyjoy?  Really?  Why? Suddenly, some old knight that got retired in book one gets page after page of point of view, a new princeling gets his own storyline. Meanwhile, the characters you really want to know about are forgotten, pushed to the wayside, no longer worthy of a page or two when their stories are what made you struggle through all that back story to get to in the first place.<br /><br />STILL, I had hope. So I plowed through the rest of book six, only to be totally and completely furious with what he does in every single storyline. It's almost as if Martin wanted to lose the fantastic readership he had in the beginning. What was he thinking?<br /><br />When you start off a series with a handful of characters the readers love, then KILL EVERY SINGLE ONE, you've got to at some point say, enough is enough.  Did any of his editors try to reign him in??  Did anyone say .... you know, do we HAVE to kill off this guy? We all really like him.  Or, can't we get a little more of THIS person's story?  Her character is interesting and the story is great ... does she HAVE to go through this bloody hell you've designed for her?<br /><br />It would be one thing if he replaced the characters we LOVED with MORE characters we love ... but no. Most are simpering, directionless, two dimensional nuisances, that take the place of fully fleshed out personalities like Eddard Stark, Rob Stark, Brianne the Maid of Tarth... not to mention Jon Snow...Oh, we get a lot of Jon Snow in book five.  But take one guess what happens to him!<br /><br />I want them back.  I want them all back, because the dregs we are left with offer nothing of appeal for me.<br />It seems in Martin's world, all the good guys die. Everything bad you can expect to happen, will. Evil rules the land. We're left with a place no decent person would want to be. If I have the ability to leave a world that seems fraught with nothing but senseless killing, rape, murder, disease, I think I will choose to leave it.<br /><br />Which is why I won't be scrambling to read book six if there is one.  It's time to get out of this world...before I get myself killed, like everyone else does.mpering, directionless, two dimensional nuisances, that take the place of fully fleshed out personalities like Eddard Stark, Rob Stark, Brianne the Maid of Tarth... not to mention Jon Snow...Oh, we get a lot of Jon Snow in book five.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|Cameron barely hides his political views here: save the planet, evil white folk running off Indians (aliens), the military and corporations are bad, and he couldn't resist throwing in the phrase 'shock and awe', an embarrassing and obvious reference to the Iraq War. This film was borrowed and in my possession for quite a while and it took me months to finally watch it for free. It just had no appeal for me and actually lived up (or is that down?) to my low expectations.     If I wanted a political movie, I'd look for a documentary. This was basically Cameron's liberal views glossed over by colorful characters and scenes. Apparently audiences really are dumbed down if they find this drivel so entertaining. I still hold out hope that most of the movie going public wants more sophistication in their films. I have to wonder though, when so many folks are apparently so easily entertained by a film because of somewhat stunning visuals and unnecessarily foul language.   Without the visuals, what kind of film are we left with?
1451629184|5.0|Ms. Dugard has written a very personal and poignant memoir and I commend her for her willingness to share!  The story is well written, especially when one realizes that the author's own formal education ended in 5th grade.  I hope that Ms. Dugard continues with her writing career, as she has a special gift, and I look forward to her future books.  I also look forward to seeing the fantastic ways in which Ms. Dugard will surely impact our world, as she has an empathic soul.

B0051OTBI2|5.0|\\"Lionville\\" is the self-titled debut album by Italian AOR/melodic rock super group built around newcomer vocalist/guitarist Stefano Lionetti, featuring lead singer Lars Safsund (\\"Work of Art\\"),  keyboardist Alessandro Del Vecchio (\\"Edge of forever\\", \\"Eden's Curse\\") and drummer Pierpaolo Monti (\\"Shining Line\\").<br /><br />Lionetti's vision is to deliver authentic, unblended AOR/melodic rock emphasizing subtlety and intensity on each and every of the eleven songs found on \\"Lionville\\". The objective alone is incredibly demanding yet through the support of his band, Stefano more than meets his goal. There is a fair amount of AOR ballads namely \\"Centre of my Universe\\" \\"World without you love and \\"Say Goodbye\\"; still it is probably the up tempo material that uncover the potential of \\"Lionville\\": \\"Thunder in your heart\\" is a powerful-as-it-gets melodic rocker with a classic chorus. \\"The power of my dreams\\" is the potential radio hit, up lifting and harmonious with an equally infectious chorus. Finally there is the male-female duet \\"The Chosen ones\\", a majestic melodic opus featuring guest vocals by Arabella Vitanic (\\"Alyson Avenue\\"), guaranteed to deliver an adrenaline rush to any fan of the genre.<br /><br />Overall \\"Lionville\\" delivers on the promise of a classic sounding AOR/melodic rock album that sounds fresh and mature at the same time. No question \\"Lionville\\" fits perfectly with the summertime vibe and could be considered the ideal AOR holiday album at that. If you are a fan of any of the groups mentioned above, you will definitely make the most of this exemplary AOR/melodic rock release. Definitely looking forward to a follow up.

0618526412|5.0|...it was all part and parcel of the American South, on the eve of the Second World War, along with polio, typhoid, pellagra, poverty and legal racial segregation.<br /><br />Carson McCullers captured this period brilliantly, in one of the masterpieces of American literature. There are a number of very strongly drawn, complex characters. Two are Biff (Bartholomew) Brannon, and his wife, Alice, who own the caf&eacute; which also serves as the community center and place of refuge. Alice, in a fit of anger, accuses her husband of being partial to the \\"freaks\\" of life. Later, Biff acknowledges the truth of the charge, at least to himself, as he gives discounts in the diner to the \\"misfits.\\" All of McCullers' characters are \\"misfits,\\" either unable or unwilling to adapt to the norms of society. There is Jake Blout, an itinerant, alcoholic labor organizer, from Gaston S.C., who will not leave the South, for more favorable political climes.  One scene has him shouting from his window at the unhearing, uncomprehending \\"masses.\\" Lucile, Alice's sister, has a child she calls \\"Baby\\", and \\"dolls her up,\\" at the age of four, for a career that the mother missed.  Dr. Copeland is the Black medical doctor for \\"his people.\\" He reads Spinoza in the evenings, and even has named one of his children \\"Karl Marx.\\" He too has his shouting moments, frustrated with \\"his people's\\" dependence on alcohol and promiscuity instead of changing, and casting off their dependence. Mick Kelly is a coming-of-age young girl/woman, 13 (and four months!), in a large poor Irish family that runs a boarding house. They are always living at the edge of financial catastrophe, from which she is seeking escape through music. John Singer is a Jewish deaf-mute who has come to live in the boarding house. He is devoted to another deaf-mute, his only friend, a fat Greek named Spirios Antonapoulos. All the other characters seek out Singer, a convenient \\"blank slate\\" upon whom they can project their problems and loneliness.<br /><br />McCullers never explicitly states the date. The first hint is \\"the war in the Orient,\\" and moves on to conclude with Hitler making a \\"fuss\\" about Danzig. It is the South, at the end of The Great Depression, with the dirt, diseased streets of poor blacks and whites near the mills. The workers were \\"lintheads,\\" and a radio or a bicycle was purchased on the installment plan. One would stoop to pick up a penny. It was also an era when the mentally insane did not wander the streets, but were placed in asylums.<br /><br />Numerous eternal themes, both \\"political,\\" and of the human condition are well depicted. Dr. Copeland gives one speech to the unhearing that is directly derived from Marx's labor theory of value. There is more than the edge of sadness in Mick Kelly's father who cannot economically provide for his family, and therefore feels useless, and is often treated that way. There is a \\"first love\\" scene between Mick, and, Harry, which includes some skinny dipping at the local water hole. One of my favorite images is of Mick, searching the neighborhood, in order to find a radio that plays classical music in the evening; she sits under the shrubs, and listens to Beethoven's 3rd  Symphony.  Economic constraints are omnipresent. There is Dr. Copeland's utter disappointment in his children and the fact that none of them decided to help him \\"carry the torch.\\" Part of the strength of the novel is McCullers' prescience: she depicted anti-Semitism before the crushing reality of the concentration camps; she also depicted the wrangling, and internecine fights of those who wanted to change the existing system, in part by describing a bitter argument between Copeland and Jake Blout. Copeland argued for a \\"march on Washington\\" 23 years before it actually happened.<br /><br />McCullers' own life was ill-stared, with an unhappy marriage, multiple health problems, and alcoholism. Graham Greene is often quoted as preferring McCullers to Faulkner, since \\"she writes more clearly,\\" and I might add, just a bit more insightfully, and even honestly. \\"Change\\" was more readily on her \\"plate\\" than Faulkner's, who was more content to brilliantly depict the \\"as is.\\"<br /><br />Can one woman make a difference? Yes, McCullers did, but also Oprah Winfrey, who has done much to elevate the reading habits of so many. Currently this book has 372 other reviews.

I will re-rate if I can ever get it to work.<br /><br />EDIT:  It works with my custom ROM.  Never worked with my stock Verizon Droid 3 ROM, but works with Eclipse custom ROM. Gave it a 5 Star instead of the 1 star.

0553801473|3.0|It is not my practice to post reviews when my Kindle says I have read only 48% of the book in question.  I am making an exception hoping that things are going to improve.  Right now I am not hoping, I am praying...to the old gods, to R'hllor, anyone...that GRRM has become a factory operation, like Thomas Kinkade Painter of Light, and that he has a horde of apprentices racketing away at their keyboards, occasionally pausing so that He Himself can insert telling phrases like, \\"Words are wind,\\" to lend authenticity to the product. At this stage of the \\"narrative\\" (I know, a jape), we have Tyrion penned up on \\"The Stinky Steward\\" with Penny (I used to know an irritating one I dubbed \\"Small Change,\\" and I pass that along) and a sow named Pretty Pig.  Now that's harsh even for crossbowing your evil father in the gut. I think.  And it's not as though we haven't witnessed Tyrion's remorse for the deed again, and again, and again...  Right now this isn't A Dance With Dragons, it's a Plod With a Pig.  And achingly unreadable.  Thanked be fortune, it hath ben otherwise:  Asha, dead or alive, got a world-class shag out of young what's-his-name before the northmen arrived; I applaud the chapter which made Melisandre actually pretty sympathetic, which I did not previously believe to be possible-- still can't quite get the interplay of Mance Rayder and Rattleshirt, but hell, details-- and as long as I can quit thinking, \\"This is just like American Graffiti,\\" with all the feckless adolescents cruising after the semimystical Blonde in the White Convertible, things are going along.  Sort of.  Except for this wish I have that someone (Daario is my candidate) would tie Dany up and tell the Unsullied to let those dragons loose after allowing sufficient time for prediction and handicapping on a city-wide basis.<br />  I am going to finish this book somehow.  My prediction is that there's no way all of these stories are going to wrap in only two more volumes.  Keep those apprentices typing and call Pizza Hut.

0345529057|3.0|I purchased the four volume version, the boxed set, and I would have appreciated a warning that the print was miniscule. I have now ordered the Kindle version so I can read it more easily. It would help if Amazon would warn readers of small print. The three stars is for the print, not the content.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|2010's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is the beginning of the end for this franchise, which began nine years ago with the cinematic adaptation of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must admit that while I'm a Harry Potter fan, I'm not quite a Harry Potter fanboy. I read the first five books and enjoyed them immensely, but didn't read the last two. It's no fault of the series that I neglected to do so, merely my lack of drive to do so. I have seen all six of the previous films, each in the year of their release and only once. I know that Harry Potter fans can be hard to please, especially when it comes to Hollywood adapting their sacred text. It seems no matter how faithful the screenwriters stick to the story, there is always room for error here. With that in mind, I am only at liberty to discuss this as a standalone film; not bothering to compare it to the previous films nor discuss how it differs from the novels. What I can tell you, and it should come as no surprise, is that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 functions as a film in context with the other books/movies. If you have not seen any of the previous films, don't bother seeing this one. If you've skipped a couple films or a couple books, but are familiar enough with the ones you've skipped, you may find this film mostly enjoyable...But I recommend having as much knowledge as possible before watching this; I admit even I was unable to catch a few references throughout.    In describing the plot, not that the plot or anyone involved in it need introduction, I'll be careful not to offend the spoiler police. Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is gaining power throughout the Wizarding and Muggle worlds, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is in far greater danger than he ever imagined. With Voldemort in constant pursuit of him, Harry and his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must locate the remaining Horcruxes (powerful objects in which Voldemort has hidden fragments of his soul) in order to eventually destroy the Dark Lord.    The excitement level of this entry rarely lets up and the film is very fast paced, but what's remarkable is that there's an actual plot behind the action and part one isn't just an introduction to the epic battle that will likely take place in part two. While most Hollywood productions begin to drone on and get lazy by the second installment (sometimes after a lazy first installment), the Harry Potter films, seven films in, continues to thrive and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 may be one of the strongest entries in the series. I can say without a doubt that it's better than the sixth film.     This film is such a strong entry in part because it works on levels of story, adventure, character, and plot. I initially found the decision to split the book into two films a way for the studio to milk this franchise for every last dime, but I concede that this was a great idea. It allows the filmmakers to finish this tale without sacrificing any of the necessary elements that have made people embrace these films. Here is a film, a Hollywood blockbuster no less that moves at a fast-pace yet continues to move, un-rushed, through the plot and develop its characters further. I think it's hard to deny the effect of a film when it elicits sympathy over an elf. Yes, for a movie about witchcraft and wizardry, there's a surprising amount of effective emotional cues throughout.    All of the actors who have worked tirelessly for the last decade have really blossomed in their roles, particularly the three leads: Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson. They've grown into these characters and are completely convincing. Any doubt about their casting should be brushed away if it hasn't been already. Fiennes' performance as Voldemort is a particularly impressive feat, especially when one considers that the wrong actor could come off as completely ridiculous in this role. There's a lot of makeup and CGI involved in the physical creation of Voldemort and yet Fiennes makes him wholly believable and appropriately menacing. His performance is wonderfully realized, as Voldemort does come off as an incarnation of evil without becoming a computer-generated joke. Fiennes also adds a certain amount of pathos that I think few actors could muster. In addition, the actors all share a chemistry and on-screen bond that can only be acquired from knowing and working with their group for many years. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have been playing best friends for ten years and they're a believable group. Most of the 145 minutes of part one focuses on Harry, Ron, and Hermione's quest to find the Horcrux, leaving little room for other actors to really strut their stuff; but Alan Rickman (as Snape) continues to stand out as memorable, even with little screentime. Meanwhile, Dobby (played, in voice, by Toby Jones), the memorable house-elf, is adorable, making for effective comedic relief and lending the film one of its most surprisingly emotional moments.     In addition to these various elements related to story, one can't ignore the high production value of this film. Yes, it has plenty of CGI (lending perfectly to the mystical aspect of the series), but it's also beautifully rendered with the world of the books lovingly recreated. Ten people are credited with various aspects of set design, production design, and art direction and their efforts set the movie-world of Harry Potter apart from everything else. Meanwhile, the cinematography by Eduardo Serra looks absolutely majestic.     The Harry Potter films rarely get enough credit. Despite being extremely well-made, high-grossing films based on a beloved series of novels they're mostly grouped into the category of simple Hollywood blockbusters. While the previous entries in the series only exist in my mind as vague memories, I can say from this film and those small recollections of the previous films that these are high-quality films that deserve more attention than they've received. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is a fine film; an emotional, entertaining, and all-around terrific set-up for part two. It's a film that long-time fans of Harry Potter will not want to miss and new fans will want to get through the others to watch as soon as possible. It's worth the wait.    GRADE: A-
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Not for children for two reasons: First, it's hard enough for adult hairy mammals to feel empathy for a reptilian lizard (the oohhh, isn't he cuddly cute factor just isn't there). Second, a lot of the humor is so esoteric than even adults would have a hard time catching it.     But for adults for these reasons: The sound tracks; the background sounds (creaky windmill); the ever changing clouds, smoke and dust; the lighting (especially inside rooms); the textures (especially the animal bodies and the wood); the detail (every piece seemed unique); the colors; the expressions; the background sets; the destruction of the background sets; the emotional expressions; and best of all each movement seemed natural and to have a purpose. The script seemed excessively cognitive although interesting to hear the dialogue in a context other than a university classroom or text. The number of unique character animals must have approached 100 so the computers being used to create all those unique entities moving independently must have been borrowed from the Defense Dept.     Finally, not sure but it seemed that Eastwood and his 5 Academy Awards showed up at the end so was this an homage to Sergio Leone or Eastwood or Spaghetti Westerns? Did I notice \\"Unforgiven\\" and \\"Pale Rider\\" allusions within the storyline and in specific scenes. Also, the sunset monologue at the end sounded like a JFK inspirational speech?
B001P06GX4|5.0|This game is fantastic.  I bought it for my 6 and 8 year old boys and they love it.  To my wonderous eyes my 6 year old (Then 5 at the time) kept pulling the game out to play.  He caught on real fast and this has become his favorite game.  It keeps you thinking and has your child think before each move as well.  This game is 5 stars all the way!!!!
B00314VYNE|2.0|I purchased this elsewhere, but it was in a box and I didn't realize she wasn't like the Woody doll we had from long ago. This was before Toy Story 3 came out so Jesse dolls were rare and I snatched this up when I saw it.    Her face and hair are very good, but as others say, her hat won't stay on, her legs and arms don't bend. This makes her hard to play with and not as cuddy as Woody. If she's a fashion doll then her clothes and boots should come off and on easily for a small child. Wardrobe changes would be nice if so.     I wish I'd shelled out for the model that had soft body and a pull-string voice like Woody too.
1439153663|1.0|Terrible, TEDIOUS story-telling! Totally implausible, outrageous, soap-opera-esque, inaccurate depiction of life and characters inside a Southern plantation household. Characters are cardboard cut-outs. The narrator is a dolt -- she's been raised in a culture where people of color are SLAVES -- not servants! -- and yet she doesn't understand any of it as an adult! Give me a break! I won't even put his book in the \\"free\\" bin at the library.  It's going into the trash.  So glad it was a gift and I didn't waste my money on it. I don't understand how people rate it 4-5 stars unless they don't know much about Southern plantation/slave culture.
0575081600|5.0|(Note: this review is of the 2007 Orion edition, updated and revised for the 25th anniversary of the release of the film)<br /><br />Paul M. Sammon's Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner is not merely a must-have book for any fan of the film - it is _the_ must-have book, both for Blade Runner fans and for anyone interested in thorough and quite readable account of how a film comes to be made and the incredible number of things that influence the evolution of a film as it goes from original idea to finished product.<br /><br />Future Noir is clearly a labor of love for Sammon, who started following the project from its early inception and has continued to follow it through its evolution and ultimate release - and its later re-release and multiple revised cuts - and the long-term impact it has had on the scifi film genre. First published in 1996 - some fourteen years after the film's original release - he has gone back and updated it to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary and the release of Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Final Cut which is supposedly the director's ultimate and last word on the film. The revised edition of the book does in fact contain a great deal of new material which makes it worth finding and reading over the original edition.<br /><br />In reading Future Noir, one quickly becomes aware of just how thorough Sammon has been, having interviewed seemingly _everyone_ who had any involvement in the making of the film, from Philip K. Dick, the author of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel on which Blade Runner was based, to Charles Lauzirika, the DVD producer who was instrumental not only in the production of the Special Edition DVD set for the Final Cut of the film but also in locating an enormous trove of \\"lost\\" film from the original production without which the Final Cut would never have happened. And in between of course are quotes from extensive interviews with director Ridley Scott; screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Peoples; _all_ of the actors, from the major ones (Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Darryl Hannah, Brion James, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel) to the minor ones (M. Emmet Walsh, James Hong, Hy Pike, Morgan Paull and others), and dozens upon dozens of people involved in the more technical aspects of the film.<br /><br />Sammon's prose is both wonderfully descriptive and engaging, as can be seen in this bit on what makes Blade Runner so significant as a film:<br /><br />\\"Blade Runner presents one of the most elaborately visualized fictional environments ever constructed for an American film; each frame is bursting with an obsessive accretion of detail. Still, it's not a pretty sight. Ridley Scott's twenty-first century is a decayed, jaded, mutated place, a cheerless landscape whose meager humanity is being ground down by the microchipped jackboot of a ruthless technological zeitgeist. Its mean streets teem with hundreds of oddly dressed citizens (mostly Asians, some punks, street gangs, Hare Krishnas, and the ever-present police). All scurrying ratlike through concrete canyons whose confines are constantly bombarded by ubiquitous neon advertising, by the blare of unctuous announcers hawking pristine 'Off-world colonies,' from huge, insanely graphic-heavy blimps, and by the sodden, perpetual downpour of a numbing acid rain.<br />--It is exactly this deluge of details -- the striking costumes, the fantastic flying cars, the atmospheric ethnicity, the moody music, the lavish, lived-in sets -- which makes Blade Runner such addictive eye-candy. And it is to this bewitching visual surface which most viewers repeatedly return. Like its industrial counterparts in the worlds of high fashion and architecture, Blade Runner is a form of ultrasophisticated 'designer cinema', one whose astonishingly complex visual field has, despite a subsequent decade's worth of futuristic/alternate world spectaculars like Time Burton's Batman tilogy or Judge Dredd, remained the high-water mark against which all other big-buget SF entertainments are measured.\\"<br /><br />In addition to Sammon's narrative attention to detail, Future Noir is also lavishly illustrated with hundreds of production shots taken during the making of the film giving the reader an intimate feeling of what it must have been like to witness the making of Blade Runner.<br /><br />My only quibble with the book (at least the 2007 edition that I read) is that it lacks an index.  It's still a great read, but the lack of an index makes it hard to look up particular points of interest if you're trying to do research or answer a specific question.<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for anyone with an interest in Blade Runner as a film or in how the film-making industry works in general.ainst which all other big-buget SF entertainments are measured.\\"    In addition to Sammon's narrative attention to detail, Future Noir is also lavishly illustrated with hundreds of production shots taken during the making of the film giving the reader an intimate feeling of what it must have been like to witness the making of Blade Runner.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I am wondering: is GRRM \\"over his head\\" with this series after the 3rd book? Or is he just lazy and greedy? How and why did editor(s) let it happen?

What would you do in that case?<br /><br />5 interesting chapters out of 73!

0307454541|3.0|Easy to get through, entertaining but rather boring compared to other mysteries when read alone. This book provides the necessary background for the other books in the series to be fully enjoyed, for the next two books are all about the characters who solved this first mystery and the mysteries surrounding them.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Just finished 'The Book Theif' and must admit it may have been the most emotionally moving book I have read in awhile. As an Enlish Literature major I have taken a literary theory course which focused on Fascist literature, and the works that developed out of Fascist periods in time, but nothing quite highlighted the guilt the German people have as a result of this time period like this book did. This book's slow and deliberate structure acts like an infectious and uncurable disease, methodically contaminating the characters and the reader and in so doing provides a glimpse at the guilt and shame that still hangs in the air of the German people as a whole. It leaves the reader haunted over many things but in particular the power and ability an individual has to do good or evil in this world and does so through the words and images that haunt its narrator, death.
B004WKOCP8|4.0|If you read the reviews here, it will probably be very confusing to figure out what to expect when listening to this album.    Essentially, the reviews here are mostly a matter of either \\"OMG it's amazing, just open your mind and you'll see how great it is!\\" or \\"OMG it's terrible, what happened to the Incubus I used to love?\\".    The album really fits neither of those descriptions, instead lying somewhere between being an unmitigated masterpiece and an epic failure - it is not close to either of those extremes.    Every Incubus needs to be viewed in the context of the evolution of the band. Clearly, this is not the band that produced SCIENCE, and even Make Yourself seems pretty distant at this point. I have fond memories of listening to the funky metal of SCIENCE in my college days, but that unique style of music is something that Incubus left behind long ago, and you can't realistically hope they're going to do anything like that ever again.    This new album, If Not Now, When? (INNW), seems to complete the transition from the funky metal to the laid-back melodic band that we caught glimpses in songs like Drive, Stellar, and Mexico, and started to see coming into full force on songs like Dig and Love Hurts.    Ultimately, however, no matter what kind of an evolution a band is going through, the only thing that really matters to me is, do I like the songs? Do I want to listen to them on a regular basis? SCIENCE and Make Yourself were truly masterpieces - every song was good, and about half of the songs on Morning View were on that level of greatness. ACLOTM and Light Grenades were low points for the band, IMO, as only about 3 songs on each of those albums were worthwhile.    INNW falls into the middle of the spectrum, just like Morning View. About half of the songs are good or great - good enough that they'll stay on my iPod anyway. The other half are not good enough, and unless they really grow on me over the next few weeks of listening, I'll probably delete them from my iPod.    Specifically:    THE GOOD SONGS:    If Not Now, When? (good but not great, and kinda sounds like U2, a band I despise, but nonetheless an iPod-worthy song)  Promises, Promises (a favorite of mine)  Isadore (another favorite of mine)  Defiance (short but sweet)  Switchblade (they're trying too hard to be funky and badass on this one, yet it's catchy enough that I like it)  Adolescents (not quite as good as I was hoping it would be, given that's it's the lead-off single, but still a good song)    THE NOT-GOOD-ENOUGH SONGS    Friends and Lovers (not a terrible song but doesn't do enough to interest me)  Thieves (sort of in-between and might eventually make my cut among the good songs, but for now it just doesn't work for me)  The Original (pretty lame - I'm hoping maybe eventually I'll grow to like it, but I doubt it)  In The Company of Wolves (so disappointing - first 3 minutes are pretty good, and could've worked as a stand-alone song, but then the band tries to stretch things out and get into a groove, and it just gets boring because they don't bring enough, musically, to the table to make it interesting)  Tomorrow's Food (I could say the same about this that I said about The Original)    Overall, it's a pretty even mix of good and not-so-good, so I should probably give it 3 stars, but I think it's more like 3.5 since even the not-so-good songs are not terrible, and have some redeeming qualities, so I'll round up the 3.5 to be a 4.
0756404738|1.0|This was a pretty awful sequel to be honest. Out of the 994 pages in the book I'd say about 100 of them were needed to advance the story. Not only was the plot long and boring, but most of it was so unbelievable that even under the fantasy genre it was unbelievable. I would have given it 0 stars if I could have because this was a HUGE let down from the first book. I'm not sure whether I'll get the third book given how poorly constructed this one was

Beck, Imelda May, and rest of the great musicians provide interpretations which remain true to the original song, without trying to be a cookie-cutter copy. I'm glad I bought it!

B0038BBA4I|5.0|Mumford & Sons is the most creative and cohesive band out there today. I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert, and it was an absolute honor to hear these guys play live. \\"Sigh No More\\" is an absolute masterpiece, with each of its songs containing intriguing melodies and contemplative lyrics that are easy to relate to. They make it so easy to connect to the music and the band members themselves. One of the things that makes them so refreshing is that they are so modest, and they play beautiful and honest music simply because it's their passion. I have always been a huge fan of all genres of music, but no band/musician has ever impacted me as Mumford & Sons has. Their second album can't come soon enough.
B00005JLD4|5.0|It is so incredible to see one human being could hold so much power over other beings. And did so much harm and injustice that literally makes you disgusted and cried. This movie provokes similar disturbing images as those of our dark history: Japanese-American interment camps. Although we only see it through three innocent lives, the magnitude is just the same one way or another.  Rabbit-proof fence is a deceiving title. \\"Longest fence in Australian history\\" is meant to keep out of ravenous rabbits but the fact slowly reveals what is enclosed within the other side of the fence.       Don't read any further review(s) because most have given away too much of the plots.  You must pick it up and watch it yourself first.  You will see how truly a wonderful movie this really is.     Adorable little Molly is nice to watch along with her courageous and witty big sisters. There are a lot of delightful moments in this movie. And one not so: like sex slave scene.     Go get it.  Highly recommended!

1402238843|4.0|Between 1921 and 1972, in addition to a number of mysteries and other less-remembered works, Heyer turned out nearly three dozen historical romances set in the Regency era -- the second decade of the 19th century, during the close of the generation-long war with France. Naturally, though none of them is terrible, some of them are rather better than others. I've read most of them over the years, and I put this delightfully complex story among the top three or four. Twenty-five-year-old Venetia Lanyon is mistress of a comfortable though not huge estate a dozen miles from York, managing the place while her brother, Conway, serves in his regiment during the Allied occupation of France -- both their parents being dead. In fact, she's been expecting him to sell out and come home for some time now, but he apparently prefers the life of a gentleman officer. She shares the house with her sixteen-year-old brother, Aubrey, who suffers from a bad hip and a short leg and who loathes pity and being helped; he's also a promising scholar preparing to leave for Cambridge, so Venetia isn't worried about him. She's never been to London, never \\"come out\\" in society, and is on the way to spinsterhood, but she's of a very independent turn of mind and those trivialities don't much bother her either. Of course, she's a stunning beauty and at least two respectable local guys have designs on her -- one rather smarmy and superior prig and one six years her junior -- and Venetia is frequently annoyed that neither they nor anyone else seems to believe that she really means whatever she says. So the scene has been set, . . . and then things get interesting when Baron Damerel, a noted rake, turns up at the Priory, his estate adjacent to the Lanyons. Damerel is a dozen years older than Venetia but his reputation as a rake was established in his youth when he eloped to the Continent with an older, married lady. And he seems to have made every effort to live up to his bad press since. Damerel and Venetia, both being not much concerned with other people's opinions, quickly become close friends, to the scandal of friends and family. The Baron, of course, isn't so vile as he's made out to be and friendship gradually turns to something else. The plot develops gradually and Heyer tosses in a couple of very nicely crafted narrative bombshells later on -- the nature of which I decline to divulge. Not only the half-dozen major characters but a good many minor supporting players are carefully portrayed in vivid and multiple dimensions and the dialogue is some of Heyer's sparkling best. Best of all, it's not all just frothy fantasy but an interesting picture of a intelligent, capable young woman's quest to obtain what she discovers she really wants out of life.netia, both being not much concerned with other people's opinions, quickly become close friends, to the scandal of friends and family.

0553801473|4.0|This is rather strange but the book does feel too short, despite it's almost 1000 pages long.<br /><br />Overall I liked the book, but too few resolutions in it and the ending... well, almost every POV ends exactly before its time. It does look like few more pages would make the book complete.<br /><br />So while I enjoyed reading it did finish unsatisfactory for me, especially thinking it will take at least 2-3 years to get the next one (and I am being optimistic here).
1933771690|3.0|After reading \\"Biocentrism,\\" and reading numerous articles written for Huffingtonpost, and watching lecture videos and listening to radio shows, one concludes that Robert Lanza is a brilliant thinker but a terrible communicator. The biocentric universe may be a transformational resolution of the current crisis in physics -- but the way Lanza presents the theory, it's unlikely to make any inroads. He should have stuck close to the physics and laid out the program in a linear manner, guiding the reader through the complete mental paradigm shift necessary to grasp it. Instead, he takes a popular \\"new age\\" approach, telling endless personal anecdotes, speaking of things like a \\"field of mind\\" (meaningless), and relying heavily on the vague idea of \\"consciousness\\" to explain all -- without even examining what consciousness is. When he does go into the physics, he is erratic and breezy, using language that makes him sound like a dilettante rather than a scientist. (Hint: It's the \\"double slit experiment,\\" Dr. Lanza. No one calls it the \\"two hole experiment.\\") Worse, Lanza's appearances with Deepak Chopra are disastrous for having this theory taken seriously.    The book is OK for a non-science person or someone interested in a philosophical treatment. But if you're interested in the science that grounds biocentric theory, you will need to look beyond Lanza's writings. The Wikipedia article on biocentrism has some good links, including the physics-oriented Biocentricity website, which explains how these ideas are not as mystical as Lanza would have you believe. Also the Wikipedia articles on the double-slit experiment, the delayed-choice experiment, and the quantum eraser provide much better descriptions of these central discoveries than Lanza does.

B004WJREMW|3.0|I'm collecting all McCartney's album, and until now this is the one that I appreciate the least.   I dislike all of the synth oriented tracks, and that could be the 85% of the content of this CD, even including the bonus album.  I think I will never listen McCartney II again, unless I am at a party with middle aged adults having a bad time.

B004WKOCP8|3.0|On its seventh studio release [[ASIN:B004WKOCP8 If Not Now, When?]], rock band Incubus are noticeably more reserved than they have been in the past.  The album's restrained nature is prone to off-put fans who are used to the more aggressive sounds that characterize the band, even on 2006's [[ASIN:B000JBXXZ4 Light Grenades (Snys)]] with cuts like the passionate \\"Dig\\" or the driving \\"Anna Molly\\" and \\"A Kiss To Send Us Off.\\" This newfound restraint does not make this album `bad,' but it does restrain some of the excitability of previous, more dynamic work.<br /><br />Title cut and opener \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is the first sign of a more restrained Incubus.  Opening with a synthetic string pad (sort of), the cut eventually settles into a definitive groove, though it is very simple and minimalist with Brandon Boyd's lead vocals serving as the most exciting feature of the cut.  While \\"If Not Now, When?\\" never reaches the dynamic heights of other Incubus cuts, Boyd does sound as great as ever and the cut itself grows on one with successive listens, even if it is never a `hit' per say. The bridge is a highlight.  \\"Promises, Promises\\" is a bit more `moving' than its preceding cut; a quicker tempo contrasts the slow tempo of \\"If Now Now, When?\\" \\"Promises, Promises\\" remains restrained, particularly given the prominent use of keyboard, however the melody is notable and the songwriting and production are also high points.  Some will still yearn that the solid \\"Promises, Promises\\" could be even more `soul stirring,' but it is enjoyable and nothing for Incubus to hang their head down about.<br /><br />\\"Friends And Lovers\\" opens mysteriously, but a solid groove is established.  Like the previous cuts, \\"Friends and Lovers\\" never feels `urgent,' meaning everything kind of sits and simmers but never reaches a `boiling point.'  Pleasant, the track is not necessarily memorable by any means.  \\"Thieves\\" hones in on minimalism, which is a pro. The lyricism of the cut might be its selling point, dealing with politically- and socially-charged themes.  The build-up of \\"Thieves\\" is more considerable than the previous three, but still there is a lack of that extra `something.' \\"Isadore\\" is a `B' cut at best coming off as the most forgettable cut at this point.  The main rub with \\"Isadore\\" is the vibe given off is just `too sleepy,' even given Incubus's `low key' vibe across this effort.  The chorus is effective: \\"If not who you were/it's who you are/and we've come this far, lover/No I won't rest until the world/knows the name Isadore.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Original\\" falls somewhat in the same trap of \\"Isadore\\" until it reaches an epic 3:44 mark in which the band achieves a bit more sound, depth, and grit; the first three-plus minutes proved bland and uninspiring.  The guitar effects nearing the close of this five-minute cut are sound and the chorus is catchy if nothing else: \\"Doors were starting to close/and you drew a rose/my,my/your mind it is original/yeah, you're a skeleton key/opening me/my,my/your mind it is original/Girl you're the original/always and always will be...\\" What is appreciated is the sincerity that Incubus try to attain, though more acceleration of intensity and grit would have made \\"Isadore\\" more well-rounded.  \\"Defiance\\" falls short despite its faster tempo while \\"In The Company of Wolves\\" is only slightly more sound, given its change of style within it's seven-minute plus duration.<br />\\"Switchblade\\" redirects conceded momentum by the boggy \\"Defiance\\" and \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" finding the band sounding much more energized like their past work.  The quasi-rap/sung performance by Boyd is perfect for this cut and the songwriting is superb. The highlight is definitely the well-penned refrain: \\"Nobody wears it like you anymore/Nobody wears it like you anymore/Light as a feather/bright like a dying star/cut those together/girl that is what you are/Wild eyes forever/built to punish and persuade/I'd like to get here/but all I got was a switchblade.\\" \\"Adolescents,\\" the first single from If Not Now, When? is enjoyable, finding the band experimenting with mixed-meter and finding Boyd achieving more vigor within his vocals.  Closing cut \\"Tomorrow's Food\\" ends the album less exceptionally than it began, but is not a bad showing by any means.  Boyd's lead vocals are commanding and the groove has a folksy edge to it, somewhat reminiscent of the 1960s... sort of.<br /><br />Essentially, [[ASIN:B004WKOCP8 If Not Now, When?]] is not a bad album, even proving enjoyable within its best moments.  The effect, however, is that the band try to `reach for the stars' on this effort but never attain this; some of the experiments fly high while others fail to resound with such glory.

B0055D3EOG|5.0|James Wan [[ASIN:B000PMLJMQ Dead Silence (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]][[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] has transcended himself with \\"Insidious\\".  This is any horror writer/director's wet dream, whatever the nay sayers may write.  He uses his obvious talent with puppets to maximum effect, lifting the rather mundane plot (a child hits his head and falls into something that is not quite a coma, but something else) and transforms it into a truly terrifying film. Wan is an uneven talent who often cashes in, but he was taking things quite seriously with this one.<br /><br />Patrick Wilson (always great at playing a creepy man in whatever he's in) and Rose Byrne (a phenomenal actress judging from this) are a couple with a secret they don't know about: their son's (and husband's) talent for astral projection, a fancy term for those who have the talent for leaving their own bodies.  As soon as their son Dalton (child actor Ty Simpkins) falls into his semi-non-coma, some really screwy things begin to happen around the household.<br /><br />What makes this film so frightening on a visceral level is that Wan is unafraid to turn the whole ordeal into a derangement of perception almost immediately.  You really can't trust anybody except Rose Byrne's character.  When Wilson's character Josh goes into the astral plane to save his son, that's when this film reaches the real great creative heights--it is like something out of the fiction of Arthur Machen, Algernon Blackwood, take your pick.  This is the best American horror movie since [[ASIN:B00006AUIG Session 9]].  Unreservedly recommended for any serious fan of the genre or anyone who wants the daylights scared out of them.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I have bought these on April 2011 and until last week it was the best purchase I had ever made in terms of gaming. The headset it totally awesome, as you may already know by reading the top rated reviews on this page, so I will not describe in details about that. The sound is awesome, it is very comfortable, the mic is perfect, it is very beautiful. But my final recomendation is: do NOT buy these.  The headset is made with a very cheap plastic and just by putting it into my bag I heard a \\"click\\" and it was broken. It was still working perfectly but with a loose earcup. I fixes that with a tape and I was happy again.  But last week the WIRE broke. And now I get a very bad sound with a strange echo and no vocals, and the mic does not work at all. I can not have a new one since the warranty has already expired. And now I'll have to spend more money on a new headset, which we all know is not cheap. So buy these and you will be very satisfied, and you will think that all the negative reviews on this page are just not real. But use it for 4 or 5 months and you will feel regret of not having trusted on this.

0385341679|5.0|Shadowfever was the perfect ending to Moning's Fever series. It builds on the previous four novels and takes you on an incredible journey, both emotional and exciting. Nothing is as it seems. I gave up trying to guess what's what or who's who and decided to let the book surprise me. There were quite a few twists and turns in the storyline. By the time you finish reading the book, you are satisfied with the ending but simultaneously crave for something more and don't want to leave the Fever world. I can't wait to see what Moning has to offer next!
B0028RXXFC|2.0|This series is great, which is why I got it on bluray. This case looks amazing the first time you open it up. It just feels nice and expensive. Unfortunately, it requires the discs to be slid out, and I believe this allows the discs to get damaged while removing them. My second disc skipped when I first tried to play it, and then it played fine after I really cleaned it off with a microfiber cloth. My third disc won't play at all in my bluray drive (HP BD240i on Win7 PC). I had a friend who could play it on a standalone player. Thus, people with more robust player hardware might not notice the playback issues. People with cheaper bluray readers may not be able to playback all discs. I actually can see a tiny surface scratch on my disc that's about the size of a hair. I have no idea how it got there but since I have never had issues playing bluray discs that came in a normal container (where the edges are held in place and you push the center to release the disc), I strongly suspect that this case design played a part.
B004Z4LVZK|3.0|Not my favorite.   A very interesting that inspired many day-dreams, but not a fascinating read. I didn't feel terribly connected to the main character, or any character for that matter.  If you want to read it, I would look for it in a public library or borrow it from a friend. It's not worth the money, and I would never read it a second time.
0756404738|3.0|My title sums up this book perfectly.  At the end of Name of the Wind, the University section felt like it started to drag on a bit, and this book opens with the University plot line still dragging on.  This something amazing happens, Kvothe decides to leave for a year and wonder the world a bit.  For the next several hours of reading, this books deserves all the five star reviews that have been posted.  And then the bad happens.  Kvothe gets sent away to do a favor for someone (I'm trying to keep this spoiler free for you here) and then it drags on with mundane stuff.  Then that ends in a big BANG and you start feeling good about the book again.<br /><br />Then the fabled night with Felurian than has been teased since the first book.  Felurian, the equivalent of Aphrodite, and somehow, even that is a let down.  What's worse, afterwards our young hero goes off and decides he now wants to be a playboy and sleeps with half the woman he comes across, even though he is madly in love with Denna.  There is even a terrible line here where Kvothe meets up with this woman who works at an inn he stayed at before he met Felurian where she looks into his eyes and all of a sudden she is embarrassed as if he saw her naked because he had a look in his eyes of a guy who knows women intimately well.  The first thing that popped into my mind when I read that part is that Patrick Rothfuss was one of those guys growing up that envied the star quarterback because all the girls through themselves at him at parties and how he wished to be him.  That somehow those kinds of people just have to look at women to make them go weak at the knees and they throw themselves at those people.  Just utterly ridiculous.  Some people may write off the part of Kvothe going around sleeping with so many woman as just a horny teenager, but at the end of the day, that horny teenager has been pining after a beautiful woman for well over a year and for him to go screwing as many woman as possible is a real break of character and implausible for us, the reader, to believe this person would do.<br /><br />While that part bothered me, it was nothing as to what came next.  Kvothe goes off with one of his new friends, who is called an Adem, to a different country to help him get out of trouble.  These people are such a rip off of the Aiel in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time it isn't even funny.  Great fighters, secret code of honor, a precious tree that ties into their initiation rights, funny clothes, buildings built into the ground because of the climate they live in, how they were chased off by the rest of the world so that the only place they could live is such a harsh place, the list goes on.  As Kvothe is learning to fight from these people, he is continually being beaten up by a 10 year old girl (who is his sparring partner).  Just about any full grown man, which is what Kvothe is supposed to be, can beat a 10 year old girl, no matter how talented, simply by overpowering her.  Just throw a big bear hug around her and spin her to the ground anything.  Yet this full grown adult, who is perfect beyond all imagining in everything else, continues to lose to her.<br /><br />And while all that is eye rolling, the one big gripe I have about this section of the book, and the one that has stuck with me in the past couple days after I finished the book, is that these people consider themselves to be the most cultured civilization in the world, yet they don't even know how babies are conceived.  They scoff at the idea of a father, they think a woman just because pregnant and drops out a baby like a plant will produce fruit.  They don't know who the father is because they are basically screwing anyone who happens to stop long enough.  When I was hanging out with a friend the day after I finished the book and he asked me my thoughts on it, I ranted on this part of the book for the better part of 15 minutes.  The worst part of this is that it is a common ploy in books.  I call it the make the reader feel like an alien ploy, that this really isn't our world.  The only problem is that is was done so utterly poorly.  How he could think the reader would accept that over all the years of human civilization, that these people don't know how babies are made, when they have so much contact with the \\"barbarians\\" that they never notice that sons look so much like their fathers?  That just because they can't stop screwing anyone that walks by, other cultures don't and families actually look alike?  It is just to much to take.<br /><br />I might have been kinder to this book, if the first wasn't so utterly brilliant.  But it set expectations that this one couldn't live up to, and I hope that Patrick Rothfuss realizes his shortcomings from this book to close out this initial trilogy with all the amazing awesomeness that the first book deserves.  And to go back to the hurry up and wait theme, which I ranted myself away from, the Felurian section lasts way to long, then it hurries it way to the learning to fight section with the Adem which then lasts way to long, then it hurries it self along to the end.  The book could have been greatly improved just by cutting off 200 pages or so of stuff we don't really care about and doesn't really add to the story.an alien ploy, that this really isn't our world.

B001EO2UJK|4.0|I consider myself a Genesis fan, though not rabidly so. I like pretty much every phase of the band's career (except maybe the very early and very late stuff)--my favorite two Genesis studio records are Selling England by the Pound and Invisible Touch. Really. However, although I'm a pretty big fan of the band, I have VERY mixed feelings about Peter Gabriel's contributions. He can either make or break the band, depending. I love \\"Supper's Ready,\\" but I can't stand \\"Counting Out Time\\" and all that silly crap that he does. I have nothing against silliness, just I don't like Gabriel's.    Okay, so that background aside, how do I feel about this box set? I think it's pretty awesome. Previous CD releases of these albums sounded kinda crappy (because, well, the albums were mostly kinda crappy recordings, to be honest). But they've done a fantastic job with the remixing of all those old tapes. Everything sounds much more clean, crisp, and with much more presence. \\"The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway,\\" previously one of my least favorite Genesis records, sounds dramatically better with the new remix. To my ears, it's gone from almost unbearable to pretty awesome (I can put up with Gabriel's antics long enough to get to good stuff like \\"Back in NYC\\" and \\"Anyway\\").    There are occasional little deficiencies in the mix (usually when Hackett's guitar is mixed too quietly), but it's mostly pretty great. Phil Collins's drums in particular sound fantastic, with lots of snap. I had read a lot of concerns about the lack of \\"dynamics\\" with the new remixes, but I don't hear any such thing--the quiet parts are very quiet, and the loud parts are plenty loud.    About the bonus material .. well .. there's not much of it, but what there is isn't bad. I don't really like their very early stuff (like \\"Let Us Now Make Love\\"), but hearing the \\"Genesis Plays Jackson\\" stuff (with early versions of later songs) is interesting. Haven't watched any of the DVD's or listened in 5.1 or any of that fancy stuff yet, so I can't comment on that.    In conclusion: Classic albums done right. Remixes/remasters sound dramatically better than previous CD releases. Recommended.

Studio Ghibli has been responsible for many good films, but Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind was actually released in 1984, just before the studio was founded. It remains Miyazaki's most ambitious work because of its epic scope.<br /><br />Nausica&auml; is set approximately a thousand years in the future when pollution levels have threatened to destroy life on the planet.

The jungle is protected by giant insects and other creatures.<br /><br />We meet Nausica&auml; (Lohman) early in the film when she discovers a discarded ohm shell. Ohms are giant creatures which seems wiser than any humans they may encounter. Nausica&auml; recovers one of the parts of the shell and takes it home. Ohms are not always calm and their eyes grow red with rage when they are angry. Nausica&auml; helps save Lord Yupa (Stewart), a master swordsman, from an enraged ohm.<br /><br />Yupa knows Nausica&auml; well and has a present for her; a small fox squirrel which she names Teto. Her first encounter with the creature shows us her true nature. She says that there is nothing to fear, but the fox-squirrel bites her. She makes no move, but simply repeats that there is nothing to fear. It stops biting and licks the wound. It's such a touching scene and gives a hint at how Nausica&auml; interacts with strangers later in the story. She's an easy character to love.<br /><br />Nausica&auml;'s life is peaceful. She lives in the Valley of the Winds where everyone works together in harmony farming the land. Although her father is the king, princess Nausica&auml; doesn't put herself above other people. She lends a hand repairing machinery or whatever else is needed. Her people love her; especially the children. For any parent thinking of showing the film to their children, Nausica&auml; is a good role model.<br /><br />The film has quite a few battle sequences, but they are brief and involve misguided people who think their causes are just. I think Miyazaki is showing us what could happen if we continue to pollute and exploit the planet without giving any thought to the future. It's a common theme in his stories and is more prominent here than in later films.<br /><br />Unlike any other animated film I have seen, Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind shows us a vast world. We explore some of it and see Nausica&auml; discover secrets about the world and the creatures inhabiting it. She has a way with animals and insects and seeks solutions that avoid killing any kind of creature. She seems to empathize and realize how to stop seemingly wild creatures from attacking. People around her are frequently amazed by her actions.<br /><br />The film shows the futility of war and the power people have to change their lives by thinking about their course of action. So much happens in the two hour running time that the film seems to move at a breakneck pace. There is always something happening, whether it's action or a discovery of some kind.<br /><br />Joe Hisaishi is again responsible for the music, and it's one of the best scores he has ever produced. There's a particular scene with a piece of music usingchildren's voices which has me in tears every time. I'm not sure why, but the music is powerful and fits the scenes perfectly.<br /><br />I know I haven't revealed much of the story. That's because I want you to discover the secrets for yourself. Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind reminds me of scenes in Avatar and Star Wars, but the story is arguably more powerful than both. If you have seen other titles from Hayao Miyazaki, be aware that this contains more adult themes than most. That said, it can and should be enjoyed by the whole family.<br /><br />Video Quality 4.5/5<br />If you have seen any of Miyazaki's films, you'll know that his animation style looks nothing like modern studios such as Pixar or Dreamworks. He's an artist in the true sense of the word and the frames of the films look like watercolor paintings. It's been 27 years since the film was released, so the animation style looks a little dated. Some of the supporting characters in crowds won't move, but the overall effect is still wonderful. Disney has delivered another great transfer. Colors improve dramatically over the DVD version. Some scenes look slightly soft, but that's partly due to the animation style. This doesn't look like Up, Ratatouille or Rango, but detail is strong and any Miyazaki fan will be delighted with the result.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The film comes with three audio mixes. Disney failed to provide a lossless Japanese option for Ponyo, but purists will be happy to see the Japanese: DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 track included this time. Other versions include English and French: DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. Although a 5.1 mix would have been welcome, I'm not disappointed by the options on offer. Dialogue is clear throughout, while battle scenes pack a considerable punch. Ambient sounds such as wind in the valley come across well, as does Joe Hisaishi's score.<br /><br />Special Features 3/5<br /><br />The additional features are split between the BD and the DVD.<br /><br />As with other Miyazaki films, Nausica&auml; of the Valley of the Wind includes the option to view the entire film with the original Japanese storyboards.

She sees the best in everyone and is a positive force. The whole experience makes the film one I love to revisit and it's always rated among my favorite animated titles.

I'm amazed at how she was able to keep hope alive. I cried several times while reading the book. I think her will to survive is very inspiring.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I had high hopes for book 5 of the ASOIF series.  Having read book 4 and found out that many of my favorite characters were not in it, I couldn't wait to read the rest of the story.  The good news is that Jon, Tyrion, Dany, Arya and other favorite point of views are in it.  The bad news is that they are merely present and not doing anything. I can't believe that it would take George RR Martin 11 years to write about nothing happening.  It is possible that he has lost his way and that he is just not simply trying to milk as much of his success as possible.  Unfortunately, from a huge fan's perspective the wait was a gigantic waste of time.  Granted there are 2 more books left in the series and things may pick up to the pace of the first three books, but right now the series and plot line are crawling. Finally, to top it off there are several Batman (think TV series) cliffhangers at the end of the book that are cheesy and unnecessary.<br /><br />I would not recommend reading this book until the series has been finished.

B00127RAJY|5.0|The video offers three 25 min workouts (less hard, hard, and really hard - yup, I didn't use the word \\"easy\\" because non of them are easy), and I have only one word to describe them: excellent. You get a really good workout in a short amount of time and then you're good to go.  I have to say that I wasn't expecting to like the workout or Jillian Michaels very much (expression such as \\"ma'main bad ass girl\\" don't really attract me) but I found the workouts to be really engaging and motivating, and I highly recommend them.  I alternate this video with \\"MTV pilates\\" by  Kristin McGee (which has more stretching) and Ellen Barret's \\"burn and firm\\" and \\"fat burning pilates\\" (longer workouts, for the weekend) and I find the combination of all of them really works for me.

0553062182|5.0|I first read this book when I was dating a therapist.  She got me into reading Elaine Aron as part of my self discovery quest.  Seems obvious that you're not likely to connect well with other people if you don't know yourself well.  So I took up the challenge of considering if I was one of these HSP folk.  Yep.  If you are wondering who you are in relation to others--even your own grand kids, I'd recommend her other book, too: The Highly Sensitive Person in Love.<br /><br />I read this with other \\"wiring books\\" about the brain (A General Theory of Love by Lewis and friends; and Why We Love by Helen Fisher).  And, of course, heart and soul books (Care of the Soul by Thomas Moore, The Authentic Heart, by John Amodeo)along with poetry.  No self discovery tour is quite complete--seems to me--without lots of poetry salted in, read and written.<br /><br />My big take away with this book was to be able to stop judging myself for being different, knowing after this study that from the womb 20% of us are HSP...highly sensitive persons.  I understand full well now that when I enter a party I see everything and everybody, all the conversations going on at once...that's just the way I am. It's just how my brain is wired, my brain and heart.  I see now why I can only watch one movie a night, for example, and why a double feature sends me spinning.  I need to process what's been in front of me (lots of things, says HSP wiring) and can't move on to B until I've exhausted A.  Another reason here that I suppose I am and always be one who takes things way too seriously.<br /><br />Also, if you live with someone who is a HSP you need to read this book together so you'll understand why you are both so annoying sometimes.<br /><br />What I got from this was that it's not a good thing or a bad thing but a wiring thing if you are a HSP man or woman.  Indeed, if you're not the one in five who are wired this way...wouldn't that be good to know?<br /><br />Yes, get this book so you'll understand the HSP/non-HSP interface.<br /><br />I'd also say that if you are not in the position to date a therapist, save some couch time, go easy on your wallet and your insurance plan at work and buy this book.also say that if you are not in the position to date a therapist, save some couch time, go easy on your wallet and your insurance plan at work and buy this book.

0393324818|5.0|On the months before the opening of the movie adaptation of this book, I decided to read this book for the first time.<br /><br />- Narration is fluid and smooth. As a baseball fan, I'm very pleased with the way in which Lewis explained and detailed baseball events and his experiences following the 2002 Oakland A's team.<br /><br />- Love the chapters about Scott Hatteberg and Jeremy Brown. Their undesirable characteristics are detailed perfectly, and you can't help but root for them and see how well they perform. I found myself engrossed in the story about Jeremy Brown, who was eventually picked in the 1st round by the As's in the 2002 draft. Scouts imnput, Beane's obsession with Brown, and the general baseball community's disapproval for Beane's selection made for a good story. That is just one chapter. The whole book is filled with rich information and new ideas to munch on.<br /><br />-  Billy Beane's mindset is that to go against the grain of  a hundred years of baseball tradition. He continues to ask questions and discredit some of the traditional outlooks of building a baseball team. He goes on to state that defense, stolen bases, and bunts are overrated and unnecessary, because they cause an unnecessary risk. Beane wants to minimize the chances of a player making an out, so walks are emphasized, which leads to the focus on OBP (on base percentage).<br /><br />- Application towards real-life is neat. Using Beane's mindset of questioning events and tradition can be applicable to everyday life. As Beane is a product of \\"looking like success,\\" he wants everyone to know that there's always more than just the appearance and obvious features; it's also about the mental side of the game.  In our lives, we can translate this to: once we discover something that you believe in, you will be successful because you will do what it takes to make it work, despite others' disapproval.<br /><br />A must read to any baseball enthusiasts, and perhaps even some who want to use some of the unconventional mindsets into everyday life.everyday life.
0316069353|4.0|After the disappointing Reversal and the absolutely awful Nine Dragons I was beginning to lose confidence in Connelly, who I thought was one of the best crime and mystery writers out there.  With more than 20 books in less than 15 years, well--do the math--Connelly was pumping them out like Romances.<br /><br />Happily, The Fifth Witness reverses this trend.  The story is incredibly timely, smack dab in the middle of our mortgage/debt/banking crisis and taps into that powerful v. powerless vein the author plumbs so well.  The amorality of the law is well documented from the first chapter--Mickey Haller has shifted gears fending off bank foreclosures in a lousy economy.  Ironically, he is mopping up.<br /><br />The book is fast paced and tightly drawn.  The style hard-boiled, noirish.  While I did figure out who the killer was I didn't figure out the how.  Overall The Fifth Witness is excellent and a tremendous relief.  Just when I thought I was going to have to give up on a favorite author, he bounces back with a bang.

B003Y5H4SY|4.0|Somewhere between 2007 & 2008, little known Director John Erick Dowdle basically stole [[ASIN:B0028DRGDQ [REC]]], inserted American actors and released [REC] as a \\"re-do\\" in America under the title [[ASIN:B001MVYUQQ Quarantine]]. Yes...I said \\"re-do\\" as opposed to \\"re-make\\". A re-make is when a director takes an older film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2008 version of Quarantine was clearly just a re-do. So I had little hope that Dowdle's next big project would be anything better than average. But I was wrong.<br /><br />Devil had been way down on my movie queue list since it came out, but I should have watched it when it hit the DVD shelves back in December 2010. Here it is 7 months later and I can think of a few movies that I've watched since the beginning of the year that would have been time better spent watching this.<br /><br />Devil succeeds almost everywhere that I thought it would go wrong. I should have paid more attention to the old axiom \\"don't judge a book (movie) by its cover\\" before finally watching this movie. The promos showed  some folks stuck in an elevator seemingly haunted by some kind of presence. That to me looked and sounded pretty unexciting. But as I said, I do indeed stand corrected.<br /><br />Redemption for Director Dowdle. He took a few little know TV actors and a couple of familiar character actors and made a great suspense film...and best of all he did it in less than 90 minutes. He got believable performances from his cast, and he never lets the viewer get bored.<br /><br />Speaking of redemption, Devil Co-writer M. Night Shyamalan should have directed this one himself, because his last 4 directorial efforts sure were flops. Oh well, at least it shows the guy can still spin a good tale.<br /><br />Check Devil out if you're into the Suspense genre (with a bit of Horror thrown in). I think 4 stars may be a bit generous considering the company that puts the movie in among those that I've rated, but Devil is one better than average movie.t puts the movie in among those that I've rated, but Devil is one better than average movie.
B004KPLVW2|4.0|there was nothing like it. Graphics at the time were primarily 8-bit.  Videogames were seen as a niche amusement, and computers were for business. It's lucky for everyone that Disney took a chance on a concept they didn't really understand and greenlit this movie. And who would've thought that the project would attract the likes of artists like Syd Mead and Moebius, and fire the imaginations of artists and programmers everywhere. Look at the opening reveal of the whirling insides of CLU's tank.  It's a stunning synthesis of art, film and sound- it was a new visual language. It paved the way for CGI, and to a lesser degree it also popularized the idea of free networks, at a time when people didn't know what a network was. I feel that the sequel really missed a golden opportunity to make some social commentary about how far we've come since the first film.<br /><br />Tron came out at a time when personal computers and cel-phones were science fiction ideas. Creating a representational world of the inside of a computer was pure greek to the older generation, but us children?  We got it. I saw Tron in the theater when I was 14 and I was overwhelmed by the artistry of it. I don't know if children today could click with it.  Videogames are passe now and graphics are expected to look more real than real life, so I think Tron will best be remembered by those who saw it when it came out and were drawn into it's neon minimalist world.<br /><br />To those fans I will report I am very impressed with this bluray.  The image and sound has been lovingly restored, and that's all. It is, IMO, as beautiful as it's ever going to look and sound. A worthwhile purchase, and one of the high notes for American science fiction films of the 1980s.

B003UESJHE|5.0|I guess that I just don't know what \\"my kind of movie\\" is anymore. Certainly The King's Speech didn't seem like my kind of movie. Reviews and promos for the movie made it seem intelligent, sophisticated, mature (which is the opposite of me) and uninteresting (my picture is next to that word in the dictionary). So I was not compelled to watch this movie at all. Thankfully, my mother-in-law did indeed want to see it, and rented it last week. So we all went over to \\"Mom's\\" house for movie night.<br /><br />Ironically, \\"Mom\\" fell asleep half way through the movie (that says nothing about the film; she does that during every movie); I on the other hand had the pleasure of being captivated from start to finish by this classic tale of King George VI and his plight to overcome his infamous stammer. The movie is so well acted by all players and so well directed that you might think you are watching all of the scenes as they actually happened circa the late 1930s. The King's Speech may just be the most entertaining history lesson that I've ever had.<br /><br />All of the high appraise and awards that this movie received were warranted. See The King's Speech no matter what your favorite genre is. You will walk away with a smile on your face.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|i ordered this for my 91 yr. old father who fought in ww II in the south pacific, mostly guadacanal.  it was for his 91st birthday and he was so excited to get it.  he said that he was there over 2 yrs. and never heard as many swear words as he did the first 2 min.  he also said there was some sex in it (he was going to share the dvd with his pastor; not now)  while it is my fault for not looking into it closer, i just assumed that it was actual footage or at least, interviews by actual marines and that it wouldn't be hollywoodized!  i am sorry that i bought it and am ashamed that this greatest generation was portrayed this way.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Like many I got this after hearing Porcelain, a song that for me (and I'm positive many thousands of people) caught me off guard the first time I heard it. A great song in its entirety. In any case, the rest of this album has a strange mix of gospel-sounding + rap + dance, it's strange. But it's very interesting and a solid listen from start to end.    This is Moby's best album that I have heard. 18, the album following this one, is also very good, but Play is his best. And in 2011 I'd easily recommend it still, it won't sound aged in the least.
0143116177|4.0|This book lived up to its billing as giving good insight into financial issues.  You can read it as  a simple primer if you're not familiar with economic issues, and a quick read-through will accomplish this.  But it also contains material that goes into more depth, and if you want a deeper understanding, it will require a careful read, and lots of thinking, depending on your economic and financial sophistication at the outset.  I think that almost anyone who reads this book will learn some worthwhile facts and concepts.
B0053YEM7U|4.0|I was very hesitant to pick up this album. I'm a big Yes fan, my favorite being the classic Close To The Edge. This current lineup has jokingly been referred to as \\"Maybe\\" instead of Yes, in much the way Yes fans jokingly refer to the Drama lineup (one of the worst albums in the Yes repertoire, and the album for which \\"We Can Fly From Here\\" was originally written) as \\"The Yuggles.\\"    The biggest news about this album is the addition of Benoit David on lead vocals. I will give credit where credit is do. Although I lament the loss of Jon Anderson, David has a fantastic voice. He has the angelic delicacy of Anderson, as well as an earthy tone that adds very nice weight to the vocal lines. If Anderson is unable to return, I will be happy to listen to David on future projects. He deftly manages to save the title track, even though it is obvious that Trevor Horn tried to get him to sing it exactly as he would have if it had been included on Drama.    The biggest downside on the album is the keyboard work of Geoff Downes. His stuff is just... lame. I don't know how else to describe it. Boring, uninspired, 80s pop pablum that adds nothing to the mix and drags the whole production down. Maybe that's why he once broke the Guinness World Record for most keyboards on a stage - to distract people from the fact that he's not a very good player.    That's the main reason for the review title - the obvious influence of Trevor Horn (the producer who destroyed Drama with his vocals, and then \\"popified\\" Yes with 90125 and Big generator) and Geoff Downes makes much of this album sound like Asia which, to be fair, did put out 2 really good albums before the departure of Steve Howe.    The rest of the lineup is solid. Chris Squire remains the only member of Yes to appear on every official Yes release. Steve Howe is here. As is Yes veteran Alan White on drums. The final selling point for me was the beautiful Roger Dean cover art.    Some of my words may seem overly harsh, because overallthis is a pretty solid effort and after 10 years I'll take it!

Some choice quotes: \\"Sometimes, when it's going badly, she wonders if what she believes to be a love of the written word is really just a fetish for stationery.\\" And: \\"the whole restaurant seemed drunk, even the silver-haired pianist, clattering sloppily through 'I Get a Kick Out of You', his foot pumping the sustain pedal as if someone had cut his brake cable.\\"
1440503257|5.0|I bought this book for my dad for Christmas for three reasons. He loves to cook, he loves to read, and he loves HP! When he opened it he was very surprised that I thought of something like this for him and that it wasn't just some old movie. He has yet to use it, but not because he doesn't want to use it. He has been very busy. After my sister and I looked through it we knew he would love it!        -treyrg
4770031246|5.0|I have followed Makiko's blog at JustBento.com and I was very excited about purchasing her first cookbook.  I was not disappointed in the least!  I actually spent a couple hours reading it cover to cover and out of 160 pages only found 2 recipes I didn't think I'd like.  My husband and I drooled over almost all of the recipes (which 4-5 are included on some pages).  There are many tasty variations of the recipes and besides that, Makiko offers detailed information on bento staples, different types of boxes and substitutes for the boxes/ingredients/tools if you can't find something.  I have been making bentos for my children for a while but this is the best bento cookbook I have found yet.  Whether you are new or seasoned a bento making, this book has a wealth of information for either with very economical, healthy recipes, many of which can be prepared ahead of time and frozen.  If you are looking for cutsy bentos though, Makiko is more concerned with making food tasty and healthy foremost so cuteness is not the center of this book like so many other bento books.  Thanks again Maikiko for such a wonderful, comprehensive guide for bento-lovers!
B001Q1QF2O|3.0|Sounds like Allen threw this album together in haste or just ran out of ideas. Half the songs sound like \\"The Fear\\" and the other half are just plain boring. She is a Debbie Downer on this album (no problem with that) but in a bad way. I thought she was just as provocative on her first album but here, she just blurts out her problems without any creativity. If I want to hear that, I'd get paid and call myself a licensed shrink. I was hoping for more but I am left sad. Hopefully the next album will bring it all together in a better package.
0553801473|3.0|*Sigh* What a glaring disappointment. 1000 pages of secondary characters. Yes, their POV add to the meat of the entire story, but really, an entire BOOK of nothing but (for the most part) secondaries? And of the primary characters covered, we are left with the same questions we asked at the end of \\"Feast\\" - WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM? Tyrion? Unresolved. Dany? Unresolved. Jon? Well, he does have a problem. Bran? AGAIN, unresolved. Cersei? Unresolved (although, I WILL say that most everyone will join me in appreciating her walk of shame!). Jaime? One chapter of...well...nothing really. Davos? UNRESOLVED. Arya, at least, is progressing - but in the way expected, so no real surprises there. No word of Sansa, no word of Littlefinger and his plans for her, a one sentence mention of Brienne - what the heck is THAT? She was hanging, yelling a word! WHAT HAPPENED, fer cryin' out loud?? No mention of Catlyn and what she has become... These are the characters who were left in the most dire of situations, yet they are not addressed. This book is a great deal of bread...but very little meat.

B0053EZXRS|4.0|Not intended for the timid artistic souls amongst us.<br /><br />Falling into and under the \\"grindhouse\\" genre of filmmaking, this is the best of Saturday-Night-At-The-Drive-In homage: Naked women, extreme bloody violence and outrageous storytelling. I remember this period of movies well and have very fond memories of places that today exist only in historical images and in the hearts of wistful times long gone. These action/thrillers and ubiquitous kung-fu flicks were the dominant form of cheap entertainment from the late 1960s through the early 1980s when home video cassettes were introduced into the marketplace, thus killing the popular weekend gatherings. It's actually quite sad. I can recall families and friends who would meet up at the drive-in, bringing their potluck foodstuffs, kids all running around, having a blast as a community at the drive-in; now we're separated by byte and HD home set-ups. (apologies for the misty tangent)<br /><br />It's interesting how much more enjoyable Cage can be when he actually acts, and by that I mean, when he stops acting like himself. Because his real personality is so much less enjoyable, less interesting and infinitely more lame. Pompous overbearing fool would be a step up if you've ever encountered the man. So I really enjoy the times when he's able to put aside his real-life persona in favor of a movie character. And playing Milton (obvious nod to 'Paradise Lost' author of the same moniker) has Cage at his best - his real self is completely gone and replaced by a seriously focused deceased dude on a hellbent mission.<br /><br />Shotgun blast of pure adrenaline with Amber Heard portraying kick-ass temptress Piper, lending her ample assets to help Milton save his granddaughter from a demented cult. Her performance is spot-on perfect. With just enough trailer trash, just enough action, just enough hot pants, and just enough modern fully-realized hip chick to pull off her role with supreme skill. Impressed with this young actress; it'll be interesting to see what she does next.<br /><br />And Hell hath no fury like The Accountant; the Devil's own bean-counter who doesn't take it well when one of the beans jumps out of the pot. Deliciously played by William Fichtner, who does the dry humorless soul cruncher with wicked fun. Been a fan of the man for many years going back to both the small and big screen. He's a consummate actor of range who always seems to be on the verge of breaking into big screen leading man roles, but unfortunately might be too gothic to pull off the all important romantic lead. Which is just as well, I'm fond of his cool calculating characters.<br /><br />Loved the extreme explosions, outstanding muscle car chases and the over-the-top brutal violence. And, no, bodies hit with .45 caliber rounds do not 'fly' off their feet and out of windows. (laughing) But that's the point. Outlandish outrageousness is the theme of this grindhouse.<br /><br />Strangely enough, I found the story deeper, richer and more complex than so-called \\"serious\\" films of today. There's a genuine energy born from movie makers like Director Patrick Lussier, an energy that eludes many cerebral arthouse productions. It seems we're stuck with an entire generation of navel-studying writers and directors who, collectively, seem to believe that having people aimlessly vomit lines from a mundane script, then shooting that screenplay with unsteady high-contrast video somehow constitutes drama. An example of this was the highly touted '[[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]]' - which epitomizes pretentious dung heap filmmaking. I was caught up in the hype and paid good money to watch that pointlessness. That's a good two hours of my life I'll wish I had back when I'm on my deathbed.<br /><br />Lot's-O-Fun if you can appreciate this kind of harsh action/adventure.o see what she does next.

B0050KEVO6|5.0|This app is really fun and incredibly creative. It's well designed, really easy to play. I just downloaded it, and I'm already addicted. You don't really have to be a science person to figure out, just have fun! I like that it also teaches while entertaining you. One thing that could be better is how the game lets you know when two elements can't be combined. However, this app has a lot of great features that make up for that.
B004Y1USJE|3.0|I have been a fan of Yes since the \\"Fragile \\" days. I have seen Yes countless times. Here is my opinion of why energy is lacking...I think the problem is Steve Howe. His playing over the last few years has been weak and uninspired. Listen to some of their better albums and the guitar is forcefull and driving. Not so much lately. His live playing is just as boring. Call me crazy but I think thats the problem.

Instead of going home, he has another task that he and the Gladers must complete. They must travel over the Scorch, the hottest place on earth, in two weeks and make it to the Safe Haven. If they don't accomplish this task then they will die. This book was amazing and I finished it in very little time. If you have read The Maze Runner then you should definitely read this.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|The BBC \\"Emma\\" starring Romola Garai is a slightly different interpretation of Emma and shows a beautiful, vivacious young aristocrat who has lived her  entire life surrounded by love and beauty and protected from the unpleasant side of life.  If you have seen all of the \\"Emmas\\" of the past, try to forget them and enjoy this production for itself.  The scenery is incredible (and there is a segment dealing with locations included), the costumes (also discussed in a segment) are amazing and the characters are loveable, or laughable, as they should be.  Romola Carai is enchanting.  Yes, she is bouncy and breathless, but who could not love this very special young lady.  I fear those who really like their Jane Austin predictable and a little stilted, may not  like this interpretation, and judging from other reviews, are actually offended by what they feel are liberties taken with our plain Jane.  Nonsense!  Slip in the disc and get set for a beautiful production.  Romola Garai is radient and Jonny Lee Miller is, well, very sexy!  Barbara Grant

I really enjoyed the tail end of the book the most though. I was most interested in how she is coping now. How she has developed relationships with her family again after so long and how much life has changed for her and her children since they are \\"on their own\\" now. This was a good read and i'm glad I was able to pick it up. I Would recommend this book to anyone who is remotely interested in the case or is having a hard time moving on from something tragic in their own lives. Her story is really motivating and inspirational.

B000XR4OC0|5.0|I ordered these,not expecting much out of a shoe with a soft sole.The inside has a nice leather piece that really molds to fit your foot.It has wonderful support,which I certainly wasn't expecting.Because the inside is fabric,I would not advise using these shoes if it is raining or wet outside.Be sure if you aren't wearing socks with your TOMS to clean your feet off before every use or you will have smelly,dirty shoes that are uncomfortable to wear in no time.<br /><br />It is VERY important to know that,over time,your shoes will stretch out.I typically wear a 10 in shoes but I chose to order mine a half size smaller.Upon receiving them,they did fit rather snug,but after only a few wears they fit perfectly.I couldn't be happier.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|Based on all the excellent reviews I bought this film... I love a good love story but this one is the worst I've ever seen. For one, the camera work is at times odd (jumping about, unsteady), the story is very slow to unfold, at first hard to follow and at times exceedingly boring, and honestly.. there isn't a single pleasant-to-look-at person in the whole cast! I hate to say such a thing, but it's sooo true! Don't waste your money and time on this film. If you happen to REALLY want to see it, borrow it from your library.
B000B8QG4A|4.0|'Lady and the Tramp' has certainly earned its high ratings. The characters are charming and fun, and those with dogs will certainly identify at least one of the dog characters. Every dog in the movie has its own original personality, though there is not much character development (which may be due to the fact that it's a simple plot...with dogs as the main protagonists). The romance between Lady and Tramp is so sweet without being overdone. As for the songs, they are not up there with other Disney songs (Circle of Life, Whole New World, etc.) but are certainly memorable--especially \\"He's a Tramp\\" sung by the incomparable Peggy Lee. The plot skips around at times, so there is no real plot development, but is a small \\"sacrifice\\" in light of this wonderful film.
0385333846|5.0|I first read Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five as a very young man.  At the time, I was an avid fan of science fiction, especially those books featuring time travel, and that is what drew me to Slaughterhouse-Five.  As a science fiction novel, I thought it was pretty good, especially considering the amount of random time travel its main character, Billy Pilgrim, experiences in this relatively short novel.  The problem with my early assessment of Slaughterhouse-Five, however, is that this is not simply a science fiction novel - and it should not be judged by the standards of that genre.  Even worse, I managed to ignore the novel's message.<br /><br />Vonnegut's deceptively simple masterpiece is about life itself; it is about the futility and utter waste of warfare; it is about time, and the way that we perceive it; it is about fate and whether any of us really has any control over what happens to us next.  Poor Billy Pilgrim certainly had little to say about the course of his own life.  Swept up into World War II, where he is captured by the Germans almost as soon as he arrives, Billy will be held prisoner in Dresden's Slaughterhouse-Five, from where he will survive the Allied firebombing that destroys the entire city.  He will be abducted by a crew of aliens from the planet Tralfamador and displayed in a zoo there along with the former porn star chosen as his mate.  He will become a successful optometrist, popular and respected in his community.  The only problem is that it all happens at the same time.<br /><br />Billy Pilgrim has become \\"unstuck in time\\" and he never knows, from one instant to the next, when he will flash forward or backward to a different part of his lifetime.  It is all real, and it is always happening - all of it at the same time.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-Five is generally considered to be a classic anti-war novel.  Even with that reputation, its message is subtle enough that it is possible to get so caught up in the rest of the story and its mechanics that the novel's serious theme is only recognized some time after turning its final page.  This book is funny, even to the point of being absurd, but it is a serious piece of writing by an author with something serious to say about the foolishness of killing \\"enemies\\" by the thousands/millions at the behest of politicians who have failed at their own jobs.<br /><br />The effectiveness of Slaughterhouse-Five is compounded by the ease with which it can be read; Vonnegut has disguised a complex novel, one filled with thoughtful points, as some kind of comedic science fiction piece.  And, he makes it all look so easy.el's serious theme is only recognized some time after turning its final page.

0316044695|3.0|This book tells an extraordinary true story.  However, it is only part of the story and one which incorrectly attributes the bulk of the intelligence gathering leading up to the mission to the SEALs.

B004Y1USV2|1.0|Ok, here are who wrote the music:    1. \\"Fly From Here - Overture\\" [Horn/Downes] (1:53)   2. \\"Fly From Here Pt I - We Can Fly\\" [Horn/Downes/Squire] (6:00)   3. \\"Fly From Here Pt II - Sad Night at the Airfield\\" [Horn/Downes] (6:41)   4. \\"Fly From Here Pt III - Madman at the Screens\\" [Horn/Downes] (5:16)   5. \\"Fly From Here Pt IV - Bumpy Ride\\" [Howe] (2:15)   6. \\"Fly From Here Pt V - We Can Fly Reprise\\" [Horn/Downes/Squire] (1:44)   7. \\"The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be\\" [Squire/Johnson/Sessler] (5:07)   8. \\"Life on a Film Set\\" [Horn/Downes] (5:01)   9. \\"Hour of Need\\" [Howe] (3:07)   10. \\"Solitaire\\" [Howe] (3:30)   11. \\"Into the Storm\\" [Squire/Wakeman/Howe/Horn/David/White] (6:54)     As you can see, some 80% of music here were written by Horn and Downes. The output from Howe and Squire is small and not really good, even according to \\"big fans\\" of \\"current Yes\\".  So, what we have here under the glorious banner of Yes is essentially Horn/Downes album.  Horn is an excellent producer, and he and Downs are defintely solid professionals. But is it enough to be Yes? Have they ever wrote anything even close to Roundabout or Gates Of Delirium or Siberian Khatru?   No offence to those two guys, but their contribution to Yes music during the band's long carrier is microscopic.   The three \\"original\\" members that kicked Jon from the band when he almsot died and stole the well-know \\"brand\\" Yes, definitely had hard time to write a good music AND lyrics.  So, they kicked out Oliver Wakeman and persuaded the duo Horn/Downes to join them with their material, and now trying to presuade us this is still \\"Yes\\".  How one reviewer put it here?  \\"The best Yes album ever\\"? WOW!   Can I smoke the same thing this guy smoked when he was writing that review? :)  I can suggest him to listen to Close To The Edge or Fragile or The Yes Album again!  I agree with many guys here who said the Yes as we knew it and loved it is over without Jon and Rick.  For me, the current \\"Yes\\" is no more than a tribute band with three members from the classic line-up.
B004TACMZ8|2.0|I bought the GMS120 based on a review in Fine Homebuilding magazine, but reality did not match expectations. It doesn't seem to be more accurate than my existing Zircon deep scanner, which I use more than the GMS120. The circular lighted indicator which changes from red to green is blinding in dim light. It shines in your eyes and prevents you from reading the display or seeing the wall behind the scanner. I had to get a flashlight to overcome the birghtness of the indicator light. I've been very disappointed with the results it produces in actual use. I should have waited until this product accumulated some reviews on amazon instead of buying it as soon as it became available.

B004LWZWE2|5.0|All fans of Bon Scott-era AC/DC should look no further and purchase (if there are any copies left) of the limited edition re-release of 'Let There Be Rock' on DVD and Blu-Ray DVD. Although I only have the former, this collector's edition is very well served...an individually number tin including the DVD as well as a sleeve of goodies including 10 still photos, a collectors guitar pick and a 32 page synopsis of the movie is well written and presented. If you have the funds, I encourage you to pick up a copy of the limited edition release, as you will not be disappointed...did I mention that the DVD showcases AC/DC at the height of their career? A cracking visual of a show from Paris, France in 1979 that illustrates a band at the top of their game. Highly recommended!
0553801473|1.0|I had hoped that book 5 would move the story forward, sadly it does not. My reaction to book five; Mr. Martin could have deleted half of it and no one would have noticed, It is unfathomable to me why he included so many chapters about Quentyn. Why introduce this charactor to just have him end up dragon fodder, Mr Martin could have saved 200 pages right there!! And Daenyrs in Merreen.. who gives a flying fig about Mereen!! who cares? really who cares? Young Griff is introduced as Daenyrs' nephew the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and 2 days later, ( not literally two days but it sure seemed like that)there he is army in hand, landing in Westros.<br />  All the foreshadowing about the \\"Others\\" and the threat beyond the wall, and we are still waiting. I am begining to believe that those who scorned Old Nan and her fairy tales had the right idea. Jon Snow is struggling with the mantle of responsibility of being Commander at the wall, Stannis' demands pulling him in one direction, family loyalty and love for his siblings gnawing at his soul, all the while struggling to remain faithful to his oath, finally something to wrap your teeth around and bam he is dead( well he had better be dead because if Mr. Martin pulls some rabbit trick I will burn book six and never read anything he writes ever again). Yes I know ..ooh ahh everyone was shocked when Ned Stark was decapitated.. a bold move yes.. but who the hell cares about the wall now? That big old boogey man the \\" Others\\" still is just a faint rumbling and the only reason we cared about the wall has now been stabbed four times by his own men( stabbed four times by trained professionals, I will never believe he could survive that and to foster some half assed miracle on us in box six would be an insult to our intelligence)<br />  Eleven Hundred pages and the only mention of Brienne was her coming to Jaime and saying I found her(her referring to a daughter of the house Stark) excuse me but last we saw Brienne she was beinghung. I do not care that the author attempts to explain this with a disclaimer that the first half of book 5 runs parallel to Book four. We already know she does not find the girl and ends up hung, it is just another 50 pages that should have been left been out.<br />  And where is Samwell Tarly? We are given one chapter, and that is not even about his studies in Old Town, but his send off from \\"The Wall\\".. We all read AFFC we know where he ends up.. another 50 pages that could have been left out.<br />  And Theon Greyjoy, the author has already established what a craven dispecable lout he is.. so he is tortured ..who cares..another 150 pages that could be chopped.<br />  So what have we learned in 1100 pages: Daenrys is still wandering ( but her dragons are now big enough to ride).Daenyrs has a nephew named Aegon that was secreted away during the war, he has come back to claim the Iron Throne. Varys believes that Aegon should ascend to the Iron Throne. Cersei is still an idiot who can not read the writing on the wall. Tyrion is plotting a way back to Westros, and bringing friends ( why he couldn't do that before he got to Mereen, who knows?). Before Jon Snow's assasination he let the fleeing Wildings settle on the gift in hopes of using them to help fight the \\"Others\\" because no one else seemed to care, (and quite frankly I am begining to not care myself). Arya has finished her assasin training and regained her eyesight ( a ploy to force her to discover her warg skills). And Bran is living underground in some sort of symbiotic relationship with a tree.<br />  Words can not express how disappointed I was with this book, and I realize I have used this review to vent my fustration, for that I apoligize. I have waited so long for this book and to be presented with at least 500 pages of fluff is truely disappointing. This series started out so promising and now I am begining to think it will end up like Jordan's dreaded \\"Wheel of time\\" so much promise only to be crushedunder it's own weight. Is this the fate of all great series that start out strong? The author becomes so popular they begin to believe that readers will just be so happy that they have delivered something they will not care if it is drivel.I thought more highly of Mr. Martin's talents, but I have begun to doubt my own opinion. One star because we find out Varys is firmly in Aegon's court, would have given it two.. but I think Mr. Martin is going to pull some slight of hand and try to bring Jon back with either some R'holl religious mumbo jumbo.. or as a cognitive \\"Other\\", thereby making any shock at his death pointless.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I bought this book without even reading a sample, based on the multiple rave reviews from several women I know.  Big mistake.  The book is a thinly-plotted mystery (thriller??) which read more like an outline for a one hour television show than a novel. The writing is adequate, if a little breathless. I did finish the book, in part because I kept waiting to get to the part everybody loved.  The part I loved was that it was over.
0439023521|5.0|I wasn't going to read this series.  I read the book summary and thought it was a brutal and ridiculous plot.  I usually don't like sci-fi/fantasy, so I decided I would skip these.  Then I was given a copy of this book and thought I may as well give it a try.  I was hooked immediately.  I loved Collins' style of writing.  It was familiar, detailed, and kept me yearning for more.  I loved her word choices.  But the plot...oh my gosh.  It was completely different than I expected.  The \\"arena\\" the Hunger Games are played in is like being lost in the woods and trying to survive while being hunted.  Yes, it was brutal at times, particularly the end, but it felt very authentic.  I almost gave this book 4 stars because I didn't like how it ended, but after reading the second book I am in love with the series again.  This book is incredible and I would recommend it to anyone.

I have been on the road a lot lately, and the audio CDs of this series have made the miles go by very quickly.  An excellent read; the only disappointing thing is that I am almost through with the 3rd book, \\"Hammered\\", and there is no 4th book in sight. :-((
1400052181|5.0|Finished this book within 24 hours of starting it. Highly recommended.    HeLa cells are famous in biology for their almost unparalleled ability to survive and replicate. The cells are responsible for numerous breakthroughs including medical techniques, testing the polio vaccine, AIDS research, and many more. The book looks at the life of Henrietta Lacks and her family through ethical, racial, and political lenses. The great irony is the multi-billion dollar industry and immeasurable combined success of numerous people (scientists, doctors, Nobel prize winners) yet her family is unable to afford healthcare.    If you're a biology student, you must read this book. Even if you're not (like me), you can appreciate the story because we have all benefited from research involving the HeLa cell line. The issues raised in the book are well-researched, accessible, and important to modern society. The questions raised about who should profit from individual tissue samples, the difficulties of patenting cell lines, and how racism played and plays roles in medical and modern society were provoking. This is the sort of book you read and immediately give to someone saying \\"you have to read this book!\\" It's a book I want to discuss with others and one that made me think. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Heartbreaking and uplifting all at once.  The book makes me want to reach out and just hug Jaycee, Thank you for sharing your story.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Must be her oldest fan being over 60 but if you like guitar riffs and a nice voice this is one you will like. Check out some samples on Utube or Itunes.
B004Y6CS8I|4.0|I really love electronic/dance music, but it's rare that I hear something in that genre that really blows me away. Sbtrkt is the first artist in a while to really turn me on.<br /><br />People keep calling this \\"dubstep\\". I have no idea what that means, so maybe I'm getting old and out of touch. If anything, this album reminds me of vintage Massive Attack ... where hypnotic, minimalist production is paired with soulful vocalists (as well as the occasional track with no vocals at all). Equal parts sexy and trippy, it's the kind of album that could be just as useful in the bedroom as it is in the club.
B004026N9G|5.0|Aren't these crocs beautiful? My niece is so happy wearing these shoes... I got them very quick and they were in perfect condition. They seem to be made a little bit small and I bought a pair one size bigger but she is growing so fast! Good product. I absolutely recommend this.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because, quite frankly, she deserves it and so does the book.  This young woman is, as I said in the title of this review, simply amazing.  That she could put all of this onto paper and share her story shows her strength.    This book is not an easy read.  She is very open and honest about what has happened to her.  Many times I had to put it down because I found myself literally not breathing.  As I was reading, I was holding my breath.    I hope Jaycee finds everything she is looking for with the rest of her life.  It amazes me how she has chosen not to be angry with her captors and how she has chosen to see the positive in everything.    God bless her and her family.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I originally purchased the Beatles Mono Box set in March of 2010 from JDM Enterprises.  Upon opening the set I got that sinking, sweaty feeling that I had purchased a bootleg copy.  Many of the packaging clues that have been published in the Amazon's \\"Counterfeit Mono Box\\" discussion pages were evident and I won't go into them in detail.  Sonically, I believe the original set I purchased was excellent, at least to my non-professional ear.  None of the bad news regarding the actual recordings was present and I listened to every track closely.  The packaging and CDs were stamped as manufactured in Japan as they should be.  Here is the reply from JDM when I inquired as to the authenticity of the package: \\"I have not received any similar comments from my customers. To the  best of my knowledge, these are legitimate. I have heard that there  can be some variations in the packaging including shrink wrapping  when they were made at the factory in Japan. I believe that the  discs should say \\"Made in Japan\\". I am not sure why the White Album  and Mono Masters discs were switched. That is strange, maybe an  error at the factory.  If I can further assist you please contact me.\\"  Jon/JDM Enterprises.  Who knows?    Back to my recent direct  purchase of the Beatles Mono Box from Amazon.  I left the purchase in my Shopping Cart until the price dropped to $99.99 in May 2011.  I breathed a sigh of relief when I opened it and all of the authentic packaging as described elsewhere on these pages was there.  I've listened to a sampling of the CDs and they sound absolutely fab. (Sorry!).  I haven't had the time to compare them to my third-party purchase (who does?) but I will update this review when I do.  That said, buy the original Mono Box Set from Amazon and avoid the second guessing, self-doubt and \\"Why in the hell did I do this?\\" feeling you may get by taking a chance on a cheaper alternative.    I watched the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan Show those three consecutive Sundays in February of 1964.  The magic is still there.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I have been a fan of Harry Potter from the beginning. The imagination it takes to write such fantasy has always amazed me. The movies have stayed true to the books; taking me on an exciting adventure each time. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 is the beginning of an end I don't want to see. I DO want to see part two, but am very sad that it will all be over. I would prefer to have Harry become Head Master of Hogwarts and continue to entertain us. I loved the movie as I have loved all of them.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This is an all time favorite of mine and I decided it was time to won it! The 15th Anniversary Edition was awesome! It had extra scenes in it that I had never seen before and I loved them! Greay buy for anyone!
B000002MY3|5.0|Raw, pure, talented, this CD has them all in it, it may as well be a \\"best of\\" on it's own.
B00130UFY2|5.0|Good action movie, one of the recent classics. This si my first online rental from Amazon, and it went smoothly, every so often it looked as though it was having some trouble but if you pause for a second or two it would fix itself and it's also cheaper than renting the physical movie. If you have a fast internet connection this will of course help your quality and download rate but unless you have a considerably slow connection you should not have any trouble.
0393061310|5.0|Mr. Diamond created a classic book for understanding the development of the human race.  It spans a huge swath of human history.  Please read this if you love history.  It is quite enlightening.

B004EPYZU8|4.0|I can tell you this: it is my personal belief that whether you hate or love this movie is determined entirely by whether you have done the same thing as the main characters. So to speak. Otherwise the action sequences are out of place. I'll explain my point.     What we see in the opening sequence is Baby Doll, a person who even this early in life has gone through some kind of traumatic experience with her step-father. What we see, in hurried sequence, is how a person remembers how they got to where they are now. We see the implications of a sexually abusive relationship and we see the terrible death of Baby Doll's sister. She is eventually shunted into an awful asylum which is implied to be a place where they sent \\"uncooperative\\" women. In five days, our main character will be lobotomized. Based on what she sees, she concocts an escape plan. But what happens in those five days is horrific---too traumatic for Baby Doll to take. She therefore constructs several layers of fantasy. The second, the \\"bordello\\" layer, is a metaphor for Baby Doll's perception of the asylum. Note her PERCEPTION: we see later that things aren't always as they appear. It should also be noted that the character performances are simplified in the same way that you cannot know the inner lives of your closest friends. You are you, and they are in your head as you see them: mere grasps of the complex entity that is themselves.     If you don't know what the second layer's supposed to be and how it connects, well....how many fantasies have you HAD in your life? o.O;; The second layer is Baby Doll's fantasy reflection on what occurred: a protection that many people create to escape the stress of their lives. Baby Doll's life is simply more stressful than we can imagine. In a woman's fantasies, she often sexualizes herself out of a desire to be \\"better\\" as it were. I know this from experience; I did it even as a thirteen year old girl. XD We are also however impossibly powerful, gloriously badass, fighting nameless enemies as a representation of our very real fears and resentments. It's true that this is an odd thing to watch, deeply private for most of us, but if you know what it is it becomes rather more dramatic. ;3 She's actually astonishingly unselfish: how many of your friends take central roles in your private world?     In short it was a blast: the true villains were painful to see (There ARE real people like Blue in the world, and I was proud of the movie for being honest about the dark subject matter in its own bizarre way) and the victory was of a different kind. But in a world where you have so little power, a happy ending would have been deeply unrealistic. The movie shows you a very real hell some people live in and it shows the kind of victory you may be lucky enough to find there. A victory in which you win by being stronger psychologically than those who crush you underneath them. Save another's life, perhaps.     So in short...I doubt it's for everyone. The themes are deeply disturbing to most people, when they're thought about. It creates a sickening feeling in the chest, the proverbial sucker punch. Intolerable to some. The dialogue is a little crazy at points and sometimes the story wandered more than it should, focused on the wrong elements. But I saw no misogynistic tendencies in it: merely the revealing of what real misogyny is like to the powerless. So...make of it what you will. It is a strange movie.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|I love every season of Supernatural, and this finally leads up to the point of Sam's journey in life.  Great episodes with a lot of humor but seriousness.  Gotta love Dr. Sexy. Sam still has that tender personality, and they show they are truly close brothers in this season.
B000002BHE|5.0|Celine is an exceptionally gifted vocalist. Her voice can convey lots of emotions. One moment soft, tender and filled with longing. With a sudden burst in octave, it can sweep an entire stadium off its feet.    Besides the well loved Because You Loved Me and Its All Coming Back To Me Now the other romantic numbers are also classics. I especially like Dreaming Of You, Call The Man, All By Myself and Falling Into You. During 1996, this CD was on almost daily rotation.    The international version or the Asian Tour Package comes with more songs than the US version.
B004L3AR0K|3.0|If you want a good naughty laugh this is for you. The chemistry between the actors is believable, but the plot is thin. This is more about a little lust than a little passion. Censorship at its best if that is what floats your boat. Soften the lighting, make it sepia or black and white. Get to the point that the \\"reveals\\" are more natural than directed.       Tony Clark    Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres
B0057UVLQ0|2.0|I listened to the songs on YouTube, and there were about three I liked. They are basically all the same, and they're nothing like her previous songs, which i totally loved. I seriously don't get why they put \\"Dices\\" on there. No offense or anything, but if I wanted the Spanish version of \\"Who Says\\", i would buy the Spanish CD. In short, I haven't bought this CD, and I don't plan to.
B0046MKWU6|5.0|The credits in the begining are completely missed because you are too busy watching Sam work out!  I don't like his personality with no soul, but it's fun to see him have a little control over Dean and the fact Dean notices it.
B000002L6P|5.0|I remember buying the vinyl during Christmas 1984 and thinking what a saucy bride Madonna resembled.    The songs are sung with a kind of girlish innocence which made the title song Like A Virgin so funny and terribly ironic. The same vocal style resulted in radio friendly ditties like Material Girl, Over And Over and Angel. Girls wanted to be her and boys wanted to squeeze her. The upbeat and bouncy tempo permeates the album making it an extremely fun record.     I kind of miss Madonna when she was young and immature and said silly things like:\\"Crucifixes are sexy because there's a naked man on them.\\" Just imagine, nuns everywhere must be itching to spank her but she would have enjoyed it anyway.    Like A Virgin is tops for me given the flirtatious vibe that carry the whole thing through.
B004EPZ084|5.0|My brother and I saw this on a whim last night... listened to \\"The Lonely Island\\" the whole way there and didn't think we could laugh any more. Man! Were we wrong!... this movie was hilarious.  In fact, this was the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time.  Definitley going in my DVD collection.
B0044KI7B6|5.0|I got this for the begining where Sam worked out.  It was worth that 20 seconds of beautifulness.  The story line was great too, good plot and the fact that the brothers had a little jealous compitition going on was fun.
0439796636|5.0|Given some of the responses to the movie trailer (some are concerned that the director will gloss over the horrors of WWII), I was pleased to discover that War Horse is a children's book, and the narrator is the horse itself!  The story about the special relationship between a young man and his favorite horse who is sold to the military during World War I manages to communicate the tragedies of war without minimizing its effects.  Characters and situations are detailed enough to keep the reader's attention.  One caveat:  a few stories are left unfinished, and some people may find this unsatisfying.  Nevertheless, I can't wait to see the movie!
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I love this version of the classic.  It's nice she got to know the man before she fell madly in love with him unlike other Disney stories, but they are getting better with that.  Animation is lovely, and the kids will love it of course!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Having seen series one and two only to miss out on the third (Only one and two were shown in Australia) I couldn't resist buying this box set. I ended up watching them in two sittings as the story keeps you on the edge of your seat. Walt works his way out of some very tricky situations and the ending means I cant wait for series 4. I have ordered series 1 and 2 and will watch them all again because they are so well scripted with the reappearance of themes and images throuhout the stories.
1451629184|2.0|Thanks, Kindle -- I had the book in my hands the day it was first released. Read it in two days. I was intrigued; her story was poignant and tragic. I felt Jaycee never saw herself as the mother to her daughers ... her diaries spoke only of loving kitties and butterflies, never the girls! And I do believe it was ghost written. Some of the vocabulary was more sophisticated than Jaycee would have used. Remember, she left school at 11, and never admitted to any more education the rest of her life. Never mentioned reading any books at all. I think if I had been imprisoned without books I would have commiteed suicide. The most telling was the story of a victim who learned to \\"love\\" her captor, when there was a strong chance the villain could attack Jaycee's own daughters eventually, just as he had attacked her when she was 11. I hope the young woman heals soon, and can face the world with real strength and courage. I'm anxious to hear what my psychologist friend has to say about this book.
B005869U6G|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Incubus for a long time, their albums/music have always had a very drastic range from heavy/hard rock to flowing/beautiful mellow songs..but this album is a far cry from any of their past works in both aspects. Every song's intensity starts exactly how it ends, with no variation in between. The most upbeat song of the album, Switchblade, has such a promising start...but the unchanging beat that goes throughout the entire song grows boring very early on and makes it one of the least appealing songs of the album. I can appreciate a musical group trying to change their sound and experiment with different things on an album, but with this effort they have almost completely abandoned what made them the great musical group they are. Saying this album is mellow is an understatement, it is mellow and boring. Drive, Are You In?, Talks Shows On Mute, Diamonds and Coal, Punch Drunk...all very mellow but still interesting and great songs. Almost every song on the album feels like they started writing it, ran out of ideas and just ultimately looped the initial idea for the song...resulting in the songs all growing very stale very early on.    Despite being very disappointed with the album, there are three songs I feel are still worth listening to.  Isadore: The only song on the album I feel that actually had some interesting variation and could have been a great mellow song on a typical Incubus album.  Defiance: Not sure why I like this one...it's a very short song and there is not a whole lot going on, but I still enjoy it.  Adolescents: The single that got me excited for this album. In comparison to their past stuff it still feels very reserved, but despite that it's the only song from this album that contains any shade of their past heavy/rock side.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was fantastic! I agree that there are not too many books out there that write about this particular age group. I found the story taking me back to my college days (early 2000's). It was so realistic to how things actually go down in college now and within the last decade. Readers past their thirties may not be able to relate and may feel that the story is juvenile, but I think readers in their 20's and 30's will agree that the disaster that was Abby and Travis hits close to home. I loved how possessive Travis was and how much his character changed. It was amazing to see him brought to his knees (both figuratively and literally) by his love for Pidge! While there were parts where I thought Abby was being stupid...so is life. We all make dumb mistakes! Some people complained the book was too long. It was long, but I found myself grateful that I could spend more time with Travis and Abby. The thing that kept hitting me the most while reading this novel is that their relationship was truly, truly a beautiful disaster!!!!
B004GCQ2WS|1.0|One More Love is just outright garbage, I cannot believe the DJ MAG named this guy the 2nd best DJ in the world? I listen to electonica and trance and I am not impressed whatsoever. Just because you put a minute of new beats you do not call it a remix, All of the songs on this CD is nore more than 3 and half minutes long, do not buy this. This guy is riding the coat tails of these HIP HOP and R&B artists he is no way in the class of ARMIN VAN BUUREN, BT, COSMIC GATE or ABOVE AND BEYOND or PAUL VAN DYK.     In matter of fact these DJ's that I have just mentioned do legit remixes in matter of fact these guys do not play simple beats a trance DJ's remix is seven or eight minutes long. Also DAVID GUETTA just appears on Music Video's doing nothing.    All this guy does is remix commerical garbage and he calls himself a DJ???  Come out with something of substance not pure garbage. Trance DJ's are just warming up compared to what this guy puts out.  TRANCE will never be big in the United States and I do not want this guy to try!!
B004LWZW24|5.0|One of the reasons that a lot of young people do not like INSIDIOUS is because the film is not for them. It is a film aimed at adults--particularly parents. Everything in INSIDIOUS is allegorical, each idea representing the aging parent whose aging children eventually grow up and enter a world (The Further) of which the parents are not part, but that the parents have experienced but have forgotten. Moreover, in this world exist terrors that may consume the children, changing them into something recognizable only in body while the spirit transforms into something awful--killer, paedophile, even a lonesome elderly person (an elderly mother or father who would leech the life from their children whose youth and success they resent)who seeks to draw the life from those that she latches to. Each ghost in INSIDIOUS represents a specific worldly terror. I'll not spoil the film by drawing comparison for them all, but think carefully about the parricidal ghost. What is the wish of many adolescents? And what parent does not fear being \\"killed\\" and forgotten by one's children? If one looks at INSIDIOUS through this lens, the film glows with subtext making it a far superior accomplishment that is apparent.
1441870008|5.0|This review is for the Audio version:    First, I love the fact that there is so much Celtic Mythology in this book. I didn't even know there were so many colorful characters. This book made me want to learn more, and research Celtic Mythological tales.    His dog is funny: and mildly disturbing. Over sexed and always hungry for italian sausages and steaks. The interaction between the two is very comical.    The fight scenes are well crafted, and very imaginative. The scene where the crow (the Morgan)comes to speak with him, and all he can think about is having sex with her is unforgettable.    Lastly, the betrayal of the sisters three witches, his comradery with a vampire lawyer, a werewolf lawyer (who both work for the same law firm), and a pack of werewolves, and the siren who has agreed to share her body with an old witch, makes this a very intelligent book, with well-deserved praise.    I must also say that the audiobook is out of this world! Whoever that person is reading the book, and playing all of the characters (even the dog), really does a good job!
B0034JKZ86|1.0|I am a Disney fan. I watched Bambi as a child and got blown away. Since then, I've seen most if not all the others, the major ones certainly. I watched Aladdin in college and thought I died and went to heaven. When I became a mom I watched Beauty and the Beast and thought it was still amazing. The plot, the music, it's still Disney grandeur. The latest one I watched was Tangled. It's not as good as the big timers, but I could still see charm in it.<br /><br />Not The Princess and the Frog. This one has finally hit bottom. There is not a piece of magic in there. The plot is totally predictable and yet lacking sense. The music is uninspiring. The only thing cute in there is the girl frog. The prince frog is ugly. Their romance is totally unconvincing. The dark side is incomprehensible. Some people claim that it's scary; I think it's just absurd. Everything moves too fast, with too much \\"flash the audience with nonstop action so that they don't realize what a crummy piece of junk this really is.\\" The movie has no point: is the girl doing the right thing working so hard, or is she supposed to lighten up? It is not clearly convey, like nobody really knows where this is all going, but somehow we got to the end and let's make it stop right there. Supposedly, this cartoon is made by the same guy who made Aladdin. Well, I guess Phantom Menace is also made by the same guy who came up with Star Wars. Can't expect them to keep coming up with miracles.<br /><br />I thought the head of Pixar is heading Disney's cartoon division after Pixar got bought. So why doesn't he teach them how to make up a good story, like Up? Finding Nemo? But perhaps he's too busy doing Pixar stuff to give a rip about the old fashioned cartoons. Even then, Disney needs a good plot! Don't just crank something out because summer is near. Make it good! You are Disney; don't ruin the good name!
B0000252YK|5.0|maybe a couple songs have that cheesy 80's hair band sound but the drums and guitar make this album rock,and make the songs wail.lightning strikes,ultimate sin,little giants,shot n the dark,thank god for the bomb are the best songs to me.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|I love love love Emma Stone so I had to see this. I thought she was great in \\"Superbad\\". Easy A jumped the shark because I never knew of a public high school that was so concerned about someone having sex. In high school, most people were having sex as far as I knew. It wouldnt be such a disgrace or big deal like it was in this movie. Also, my high school had no zealot Jesus freak lemmings either, sitting around singing hymns before homeroom. It was cute though- I liked the backround idea that she was helping out the downtrodden and unfortunate guys in her school from being \\"outted\\" as losers and all, but at times it was just unbelievable. I loved the end though with the guy she really liked. That was adorable.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|To start, I'm perplexed by the negative or lackluster reviews of this album, on here, by fellow music fans.  Although there are few negative reviews in relation to positive ones I am left wondering why or how there are any.  Did they really listen to this album?  I, myself a musician and a member of a band, often take a while to warm up to contemporary bands and find myself being quite picky when it comes to songwriting, melodies, and instrumentation.  The Fleet Foxes pass all of my music snob tests (if you will) and then surpass them with their collective brilliance.  I understand there are alot of bands, at the current moment, going for this folk, mystic sound but none of them get anywhere near the universe of this band in execution and originality.  Their debut Ep Sun Giant was a juvenile preview of the breath of fresh air yet to come.  Their self titled debut was a \\"Holy Hell\\" wakeup call to the dying music industry.  Helplessness Blues is a young band with an already incredibly mature understanding of music creation growing up and reaching stunning heights.  I love how they didn't re-create the old-world feel of the first album and went for something a little more straight forward, yet more beautiful and enticing.  This album has layers, technically, lyrically and vocally that the first album didn't come close to.  In essence, I don't understand the reservations toward this release-it's brilliant and get's better with every endulgance.
1567184855|5.0|Case studies written by a Hypnotherapist, detailing what transpires in the Spirit World. Discussed are what happens after death, orientation and study by transitioned souls, the various levels of soul development, and what happens before, and during, the entry of a soul into the Earth Reality. Fascinating and Compelling. Highly recommended, but note that the hypnotherapist has a PhD and communicates like one.
1451629184|2.0|I purchased this book and after the first 100 pages I was ready to put it down. It was very dull (especially her journal entries). I wish I would have loved it but I didn't. Terrible thing that happened to her but the book was not hype had made it seem.    A ton of the book is her talking about her kittens and her dreams. 600 pages of mostly journal entries.    ** since so many of you are upset that the book made me bored then read this. I did not mean that what she experienced was boring what so ever but I expected more of her life story not her journal entries. I wanted to read about how she conquered this not about her cats. Sorry that I was honest and reviewed the book based on the content and not on her terrible experience. Some of you are so twisted to think that I wanted this book to be all about the bad experiences. SO please don't assume. Thanks :)
0316044695|5.0|Hi,I read this book 2 times and it was very hard to put down.It taught me what frienship, honor and sacrifice are all about,not to mention to never give up!  I never realized what these men go thru,makes you reflect on your own life.Could you do what they did?Would you make the same decisions?What do you believe in?  I just thank God for men like these.I think when your done reading this book,you'll thank them too!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I love reading and can devour a book in 24 hours, if it's a great read. This book is a great read, but that sounds just wrong when you read the details of Jaycee's captivity. I could only read a bit of this book, before I had to put it down to process the terrors this girl went through. Jaycee really is a saint and the strength she had to go through this ordeal. Mental preparedness is necessary to handle this book.

1609419693|5.0|Hilarious audio book! Made a long drive a very enjoyable experience.  Must go and read the hard copy book now...
0553801473|3.0|This book is between 2 and 3 star for me and I'm being generous with the 3, rather than 2 given the previous books...<br /><br />I just got done reading the book, and wow...it was really disappointing in many respects.  Fantasy books are suppose to entertain us, not lock us into some boring tale to stroke the writers ego for his ability to describe every flower and every stone in the world created.  There were some great parts to the book, but overall, Martin seems to been afflicted by the Robert Jordan syndrome of getting far too enraptured and engulfed in his own yarn being spun, that he gets tied up in knots.  This book was indeed a VERY long yarn, just as many of the later books in the Wheel of Time series, before Sanderson took over.  This book is just simply boring and extremely repetitive is so many parts that I found myself forcing me way through arts of the tale.  I'll forgo any deep spoilers, but one of the most interesting characters in the story has been Tyrion, but what the heck was up with his boat trip?<br /><br />Another of my favorite Characters, Jon Snow...I'll save any spoiler here, but I was HIGHLY disappointed with regards to his development in the story (I also think I clearly know where he's going with this angle...which is only adding to my dissapointment).  Yet another POV that consumes so much of this book...Daenerys...WTF Martin?!??!  What happened to the confident queen that had arisen in the previous book?!?!?<br />Bran's tale was a dead end...and I'm not sure where he's going with that, but at least we saw movement with that.  The only saving grace of the book was My favorite of the series, Arya...my fingers are crossed, but there is A LOT of horizon movement on her story as well.<br /><br />I had enjoyed the series, because of the gritty writing and Martin's boldness in having all cards on the table in telling the tale.  I've always dislike writers who heavily rely on \\"gotcha\\" plot devices and \\"cheap\\" mechanics to get plot moved, but this book was riddled with it to an unprecedented level.  With two books projected to be left in the story, I can't see how it is going to be remotely possible for Marin to tie up all his loose ends without gutting the plot and heavily rely on even more plot devices to reach a conclusion.  The even worst alternative is a money grab and extension of the series to additional books past the stated 7th one.  I only started reading this series 2 years ago, so I didn't have the painful 5 year wait, but likely, if he takes that long for the next book, I'm almost going to skip it.

B004UHF51S|5.0|I've been an admirer of Michael Franks' records and the songs within for decades now, and only discovered him because of the openness of FM radio in the 70s.  A station such as WNEW-FM, known for it's rock sensibility, frequently played tunes off \\"The Art of Tea\\" and even interviewed him in studio one morning.  I was immediately hooked (and floored) by the intelligent lyrics even before I could begin to sit back and let those melodies sink in. No one could drop cultural and historical references in his songs with such aplomb while dressing them in classy, palatable jazz arrangements.  His persona at the time seemed to be that of a more than casual observer and participant in the trials and tribulations of love and romance.  Over the years, those cynical views had largely given way to a picture of domesticated bliss, while taking a sideways glance at the past. Just one look at the cover art of \\"Time Together\\", and the first thing a seasoned fan might notice is the absence of tropical imagery, showing instead a pastoral setting depicting him, his wife, and their recently departed, beloved dog. Franks' latest release, \\"Time Together\\", appears to have completed some kind of musical and lyrical circle.  The relatively spare arrangements are reminiscent of Franks' earliest releases, though his lyrics are now reflections of someone who is both looking back at his life so far with an appreciative eye, and forward with the wonder of a child.  If it's possible, his lyrics reveal an almost \\"mature innocence\\".  This is someone who knows the meaning of life.  The usual all-star roster of sidemen makes a distinguished appearance, and in particular, I was happy to see brilliant pianist and producer Gil Goldstein (who played in my favorite touring band of Michael's way back when) lend a steady hand.  Franks is one of those unique songwriters who can hold your attention with his words, even if the band takes a 2 or 3 minute solo. The artist seems to be extending a hand to his audience this time, inviting it in to share his world. This is a lovely addition to Franks' body of work, and an album I can easily recommend to longtime fans, and those who need an introduction.
B000KQF6X0|5.0|I've been a fan of Black Rain since I first saw it on HBO, decades ago.  Its been a go-to movie for me since then, on VHS, cable, DVD, Special Edition DVD...seen em all.  You dissect a film like Black Rain, and the individual parts may not make you think \\"classic\\", but to look on it as a whole, it has \\"something\\", an intangible vibe that captures an embellished world you want to revisit. Michael Douglas' acting is outstanding even if he is unlikable, and Andy Garcia mumbles through his lines with a sincerity that foreshadows his amazing career. Supporting cast is mostly strong, Hans Zimmer hits it OUT OF THE PARK soundtrack wise (this score has been used and reused several times in random movie trailers and the like, which exemplifies its longevity), and Ridley Scott directs the smoky, high contrast worlds of New York and Japan.  Again, I cant quite put my finger on what makes it such a great film, but its there, and maybe you had to be there, growing up with the movie all these years.  I'd be interested to hear what a first time reviewer would think about the movie juxtaposed to modern action/dramas.<br /><br />Several have bashed the Blu-ray treatment, and I'm not saying I haven't seen better, but I've seen worse, and this is far from them.  The picture, to me, is clear as I've seen it, and reflecting back on the many versions over the years, its the best I would imagine would could expect, from a shot-on-film movie from the 80s.  Considering the source material, its pretty amazingly sharp, with details popping out that I hadn't noticed over the course of many, many viewings.  The copter-pan as they fly into Japan, overlooking the hazy industrial setting looks vibrant saturated, and it never took on that life the 30+ times I had seen it before.<br /><br />The DTS track is nice, although inconsistent - music booms and various action scenes pop out, but slower paced dialogue drops back a bit too much, level-wise.  I watched it on a solid surround system, and it required some adjustment to either hear the voices or not get blown out of your seat by various sound effects.  The Dolby 5.1 is fine overall, but has nowhere near the weight of the DTS track.<br /><br />Parts of the movie hold up over the many years, and to say they don't make em like they used to would be accurate.  The gritty earnestness of a movie like this is what made pre-CGI movies so special, and classics that, frankly, won't be produced again.  Fantastic film, and great to own it on such a remarkable media.tment to either hear the voices or not get blown out of your seat by various sound effects.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is the type of book that you will not be able to put down once you start reading it. You will fall in love with the main characters and will be craving the type of passion and love the author so brilliantly describes in your own life. You don't want to miss this one. I can't wait for book #2 in this series to be released.
B0051BNRTO|3.0|This is one of Hornby's more introspective works and unlike his most popular novels, contains a higher ratio of melancholy vs. humor.  Hornby's best works have a snappy pace to them that provides a dazzling reading experience filled with a melange of eternal man-child characters, pop culture references, humor, and lines of dialogue worthy of quotation amongst friends.  While this particular work lacks the overall vitality that one would expect it still provides a read worthy of your time, especially if you're a fan of the author's previous works.
B004WMKSH2|4.0|When I say this film is dark, I don't mean in its visual presentation, which is superb. The cinematography and special effects are top notch. But much like \\"Half Blood Prince\\", DH Part 1 has very little of the delight and joy which were evident in the early books and movies. Yes, those stories had the dark elements associated with Voldemort and in the dangerous seeming climaxes, but other parts of the stories were highly entertaining and uplifting in their depiction of life at Hogwarts. Harry's problems with his aunt, uncle, and cousin were played for laughs. Classroom scenes were at time frustrating, and at times funny, but always interesting.<br /><br />At some point in this process JK Rowling lost the wonder of her early books, and began to see herself as a SERIOUS WRITER OF DRAMA. At that point all the fun drained out of her stories. I have finished them merely to finish them, not because I really had fun with the last books, or these last three movies. DH Part 1 is a lot like \\"The Dark Knight\\" in that the movie is expertly crafted, but just gives the viewer very little hang onto in terms of tension breaks. I think this is a big mistake for any movie. The goal of a movie such as this should be to entertain the audience, not exhaust them. I'll have no problem re-watching the first five movies at times, but I seriously doubt there will be ANY repeat viewings of the final three movies for me. Just as even though I'm a big time Batman fan, I've had absolutely no desire to watch \\"The Dark Knight\\" a second time. Unrelenting tension and misery for the main characters isn't my thing. I get enough of that just running a business. LOL<br /><br />So if you have read all the books and watched the first six films, certainly there is no way you are going to miss this one, or the conclusion. You have too much invested in the story over the years, just as we do. You will be impressed at the special effects, which are so natural to this vision of a magical society by now that you will forget that they ARE special effects. You'll be uplifted at our heroes' little victories, and sad at the tragedies which befall them. If you're like me, in the end you may also feel a bit empty, because the charm and joy which the first books and movies in this series promised is long gone by the stark and depressing tone of its ending.at they ARE special effects.

0670022411|5.0|This is a book you can get lost in, and spend all day on the couch reading while you ignore all the chores you should be doing.  It is one of those books that you pick up for some bedtime reading and before you know it, it's 11:30 and you think to yourself, dangit, I need sleep, but just a few more pages...It is true that it is very reminiscent of Twilight, but for grownups.  And besides, I loved Twilight.
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|Not having seen all the Harry Potters I went to see this on opening weekend with friends who updated me on part 1 to bring me up to date.<br /><br />If you have not seen Deathly Hallows part 1, or the previous Potters here is what you need to know.  Harry Potter, young wizard with friends, gets into trouble (again) and uses magic to get out (again).  Mortal enemy Voldemort intends to get him and rule the magical world with his evil powers.  He must be stopped before it's too late. His soul is in seven different locations.  Some of these have already been found in part 1.  In order to win against this enemy HP must find all these remaining portions, and destroy them, and in so doing end Voldemort's reign.<br /><br />Another key character is Snape played by Alan Rickman, who also goes by the name of Severus.  His role in previous movies has been occasional ally, occasional foe.  Here his role will be completely defined, and understood.<br /><br />Voldemort needs serious plastic surgery, particularly, a nose job, an ear job, and eyebrow implants.  You would think with all his magical powers that he might work some magic on his appearance first, but no!<br /><br />Not being an HP aficionado, I did enjoy the movie.  We watched in 3D. I think it would be just as enjoyable in 2D.<br /><br />One thing I enjoyed about the movie were the turns of phrase:<br /><br />'I want to speak to the goblin.'  We found this quite amusing.<br /><br />'The wand chooses the wizard.'<br /><br />'If you ask you will never know.  If you know, you need only ask.'<br /><br />'If no one alive has ever seen it, then let's ask someone dead.'<br /><br />'Now is the time to come forward or be destroyed.'  Voldemort.<br /><br />The deeper you go into the movie the better it gets, as you get drawn into what is particularly Harry Potter, goblins, invisible swords, diodems, as the train pulls out of Hogwarts for the last time.  Finally you get a sense of clarity, and even some unexpected emotion at what happens to key characters.  Those will they, won't they moments. Even those life and death moments.<br /><br />Obviously, HP has kept the British acting industry employed for several years, and made Emma Watson the world's highest paid actress according to the Guinness Book of Records.<br /><br />Having seen four of the series, this is the best one I have seen.  The quality of the movie, direction, acting, story is top notch, demonstrates that Britain also can produce not only the James Bond franchise, and Harry Potter, but also many other movies that can rival the best of Hollywood.  Lord of the Rings was made in New Zealand, so it's great to see diversity in filmmaking, not just in Hollywood but all over the world.<br /><br />You may have noticed that Harry Potter continues its magic ways, conjuring $168 million at the box office on its opening weekend, making it the highest opening weekend ever for any movie, surpassing Dark Knight.  Now that's magic.  I wonder if you found this review helpful.<br /><br />Will Potter return?  I wpuld not be surprised if there was a spinoff of some kind.th moments.

B00004SC3M|5.0|I was so happy to finally get this title on DVD. Sean Connery stars as an aging thief living the high life...alone. When a woman comes into his life (Catherine Zeta-Jones), tasked with monitoring him for the police force as an agent, Connery is one step ahead of her. Abiding by the laws against entrapment, Connery invites Zeta-Jones into his home, tutoring her in the art of thievery.     This film is filled with drama and suspense until the end. The action sequences are great during the thefts, and one can really get immersed into the world Connery crafts as a master-thief. Furthermore, the interplay between the two actors is brilliant, with both coming together with their respective A-games. All-in-all this is a classic, even if it has not been celebrated to the extent that it should be! The DVD brings better quality and maneuverability to this classic. By all means this is recommended!

At first, I thougth the start was a little slow and then \\"GOTTCA\\"  I was hooked.  Deborah did a great job weaving her tail to create a believeable  book that is a real page turner.  It grabbed me and did not let go.  The ony problem was that she left everyone hanging as the second book is not yet ready!!!    Keep them coming Deborah!!!

B0053F042G|2.0|Jake Gyllenhaal continues to create unimpressive movies.  If you can't figure out who the terrorist is in the first scene, you aren't very good at noticing the obvious.  If you think the movie won't end exactly how it does, then you are not good at noticing the obvious.  Yes, there is a minor twist in the plot - one that makes the premise even more absurd - but maybe some will find that cool.  I did not.<br /><br />This is not a good movie.  It requires zero critical thinking and even less intelligence.  It's almost like a comedy writer tried to write an suspenseful action film, but forgot that you need a solid storyline and plot to create suspense - and a halfway decent special effects budget to blow up trains.<br /><br />Don't do it.  Not worth the time, not worth the money, and not worth the time.
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|The scenery in the movie is stunning. Absolutely jaw dropping stunningly beautiful. The movie is shot very clearly and vividly. And then that's where all the good ends. Most of the time the characters are staring at each other. We see Valerie's red almost crying eyes every 5 minutes of the movie. She does have lovely eyes but it seems that is what the movie boiled down to. Who can stare at each other the longest. I really wanted to enjoy this movie but it did not go anywhere. The trailers built this way up, so it was just a huge let down for me.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|After listening to this 3 or 4 times ,....I've come to the conclusion that Yes doesn't sound much like Yes anymore.  The basic elements are there,...but the whole doesn't add up to much of a Yes-like album.  This sounds like Drama but only slightly,it sounds a bit like a solo Chris Squire album in a way,....but over-all it's a short-falling attempt to sound like YES of old. Heck,it's not that great of a \\"prog\\" album,only hitting \\"pretty good\\" on my scale.         Worse than that there are no recognitions towards their \\"canning\\" of Jon Anderson,...he doesn't get mentioned in the \\"making of...\\" DVD(which,by the way, has NO live footage at all!)and he's not even thanked for his years of service in the \\"thank you's\\".  It's a shame.         I know most of you don't really care who sings here....as long as they are a good singer.  But after hearing this,with it's strained attempt to sound like the clasic group,to me it's clear that this band should change it's name(at least out of respect). For me if this were released under a new name then I could accept the sounds here easier.  It's a fairly well done prog album,......but it doesn't sound very much like Yes to me.  Gone are the orchestral moves in the music,and it all sounds a bit forced(especially since most of it was written by former Buggles members).            Sadly one song talks about helping someone in their \\"hour of need\\",...this coming after dumping their lead singer during his sickness ,and then not even contacting him for any duties (even as back-up singer/co-vocalist) on this or any farther albums or tours.   Theirs is \\"all disgrace\\"!  Shame on you,\\"shadow of Yes\\".
B004X0XA82|2.0|I must say I was really hyped up to get this album. Yes there are definitely hundreds of cases where you get excited off an artist's new release based solely off of their previous releases.Fleet Foxes and Sun Giant were so good to me that I ASSumed that helplessness blues would be the next level or an album to cruise their recent compositions through. I'll have to agree with the reviewers saying that lorelai was ripping off fourth time around by bob dylan. Seeing i'm a huge folk fan and I know the classics such as Crosby, Stills, and Nash, Neil Young, Simon & Garfunkel, and Peter, Paul, and Mary, I can see that the Fleet Foxes are trying to bring in their influence into the modern world of music [some who call it all indie unrightfully so]. So i'll make this a brief review and say while some of the melodies are kinda okay, and the lyrics and vocals are horrible, this album does not hook you in or does it reach any level of musical experience as their previous works do. I sure hope they suit up for future releases. God knows they'll be doing more now that they've made millions off of this new album.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This film adaptation to the first segment of JK Rowling's final Harry Potter book was acceptable. The imagery and film quality greatly make up for the flawed story line that was strewed together by the film writers. Characters are consistent from one film to the next, and therefore cannot be discredited for their out-of-place appearances later in the series. Realizing that film is a much different medium to tell a story, the point of the films is really to admire the beauty of the world Jo made for us. Thank you.    However, this movie is far from a 5-star rating. The ending was rather anti-climactic. I was severely disappointed with the closing scene. The viewer was left without any \\"what next?\\" left in their mind, and instead were left with a sequence unrelated to what the lead characters must do from their previous predicaments.    If you've read the books, this movie ends at the conclusion of chapter 24, yet about 2-3 pages before the actual end to that chapter.    I'm extremely glad that I did not see this movie in theaters... otherwise, I would have been sorely disappointed and not really given to wait another year or two for the conclusion... Especially when now there is such great anticipation that it might not be surmountable.    Brava to Jo for a wonderful tale and world. Nod to David Yates, but shaking my head at the writers.

B001TH16DI|3.0|This package has an outside sleeve that slips over the top of the slip cover. Normally I would just remove this and keep the slip cover with the blu-rays on the shelf. The slip cover has a Star Trek insignia on it that sticks out a little (which catches the outside sleeve when you try to put it back on) but there is nothing else. No list of movies or even so much as Star Trek written on the outside. All of that information is on the outside sleeve. I don't want to have to pull that sleeve off and put it back on every time I want to watch a Star Trek movie. The movies are in individual blu-ray cases.    The extra disc was interesting, but not worth getting the set just for the interview. I haven't watched the other 80 minutes of new special features yet.    The Motion Picture is not the directors cut as it was in the DVD boxed set with 1-10.    My 3-star rating reflects the packaging and lack of extra content I had hoped for. I do like the movies and would recommend this set for anyone who did not already have the movies, or if you are a huge Star Trek fan and love every minute of new special features you can get your hands on.

I teach gentle yoga and these asanas in the beginning section are fantastic for my students! I've learned so many new (to me) asanas to teach them, I think it sets the stage for a better foundation. This book is FULL of asanas from beginning to advanced. The names are different on some of the asanas, this doesn't really bother me. I can't wait to continue picking through this book!

I was a little worried because I am using Windows 7 64bit and some reviews sounded like it might not work.  But this has worked great.  It installed easily with the supplied drivers and has worked perfectly.  It was also much cheaper than other competing products but it is well built.
B00005JNX0|5.0|After watching Madagascar, it quickly became my three year old daughter's favorite movie.  The movie was interesting enough to keep her attention and contained enough adult humor to make watching it over and over and over and over again a bit less mundane.  The story of four NYC zoo animals running away and ending up in Madagascar is hilarious and the music is very catchy.  We \\"move it, move it\\" all the time in our house now.  There is little violence and I do not have any qualms about my young daughter watching the movie.  This is fun for the whole family!
159514188X|5.0|I loved this book. Not only does it make you realize the challenges teens face daily with their peers. But it reminds you that everything you say and do can affect someone you care about in ways you never imagined. Not only is it 13 reasons why but it is 13 things that tilted this young girl deeper into depression and away from hope. This book reminded me to be kind, and that you never know what someones day or home life is like. Have patience and kindness for everyone you come into contact with.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This movie is great for boys and girls alike.  My two year old was enamored and actually had a CARS party for her third birthday.  She became obsessed with collecting each of the CARS.  She was also the only girl in her daycare with lightup Lightening McQueen shoes (yes, boys shoes - they make NO girl CARS stuff).  The movie is cute and the G rating is appropriate.  There is only one scary scene where Mater and Lightening go \\"tractor tipping\\" and a large tractor named \\"Frank\\" chases them through the field.  The story is simple enough for young children to understand the plot, but interesting enough for the parents that will no doubt have to sit through it countless times.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|This is not a rating for the durability of the product because I have not owned it long enough to rate.<br /><br />I needed a xbox style controller badly because my PS3 controller hurt my hands. Everyone says not to go 3rd party but in the world of PS3, I had no choice. I read all of the horror stories about deadzones and bad connection, but I had to buy something. The power A feels great in my hands. I don't feel the usual tension that I normally get with the sixaxis. The responsiveness of the L and R analog sticks felt nice, but had slight deadzones. I had to turn my sensitivity on Black Ops down to compensate for the force required to turn normally. After that, everything balanced out. The D pad, however, is a problem. I sometimes had to hit it 3 or more times to get a resonse. It has lost connection for no reason as well, but I wouldn't say it does often.<br /><br />So is this controller for you? Well, that depends on what you are looking for. If you looking for something to compare to the sixaxis with smoothness and responsiveness, then this is not what you are looking for. But if you want a controller that feels wonderful in your hands and gives slightly less gameplay quality, then this might be for you. All of my testing was done playing Black Ops. There was a slight feeling out period when I couldn't kill anything, but after an hour, I got my stuff together and was able to maintain the same quality of play as I would with the sixaxis. Except this time, My hands didn't hurt from holding a tiny controller.
B003XDZLTG|5.0|I was skeptical about purchasing Crocs as my daughter has a pair of the classic clogs and falls everytime she wears them.  However, I needed a pair of \\"Camp shoes\\" and these fit the bill.  My husband and I do a lot of backpacking and these are light weight enough for us not to think about whether or not we really need to take a pair of comfortable shoes to change into.  They are perfect in camp with socks and also good for light river crossings.  I purchased the Mary Janes particularly for this reason as the top strap provides a bit more security in the water.  I wouldn't recommend them for strong river crossings as they can be a bit slippery and are still loose (go Teva for that).  These shoes have gone with us from the North Georgia Mountains, to Yellowstone, to the Inca Trail in Peru and up to the top of Mt. Kilimanjaro.  At home, they live in a basket beside the back door and I wear them out the water the plants, play in the yard with my daughter, run quick errands, etc.  They are not highly fashionable, but the are quick and serve thier purpose.  I definately recommend these shoes.
0553801473|1.0|Let me say I think GRRM has a great sense of character and can do a plot twist like nobody's business.<br /><br />That said, does he know how to wrap up ANY storyline without a death to the main character in that storyline?  We've invested hours and pages in characters and plotlines, only to have brand new characters introduced...AGAIN... and a character we are invested in killed off because GRRM doesn't know what else to do with them.<br /><br />I was hoping to find Dance With Dragons have more focus and development on Jon, Arya, Bran and their wolves, Tyrion, Cersie, Jamie, and Dany and Sam.  Was I disappointed?  In the end - yes, big time.  (possible spoiler ahead)<br /><br />I got a lot of back & forth with Dany and Meeren and almost no development of her relationship with the dragons or who else may ride them.<br />I got bits of Arya's growth, but not much and only toward the end of the book.<br />Bran - a few chapters of odd situations that seemed like filler and a way to put him aside.<br />Jon got chapters about his dealings with Wildings and Stannis, but not the Others or Ghost.<br />Cersie - chapters toward the end of the book ending in her being marginalized and set aside.<br />Jamie - one chapter only!<br />Sam - nothing<br />Tyrion - Hurray!  Some interesting bits of intrigue but not what I was hoping for.<br />New people - lots and lots and I didn't care about any of them at all.<br /><br /> I loved books 1 & 2 and they got me hooked on this series.  Book 3 was annoying at times, but I stuck with it.  Book 4 was a dissappointment because of the new characters, but I gave it a chance & held out hope for this book.  That said, I will not recomment this book or series to anyone and I doubt I'll read anything else in the series in the future.  GRRM is a good writer, too bad he cannot end a story.  Maybe a new editor would help, but I doubt it.
B004LWZW24|4.0|It really was scary...not just a once in a while type scary, but an all through out the movie scary.  My 11 year old son watched it with me (he's seen all the great scary movies)  I was surprised how much this scared him.  A lot of the movies that I find scary, he calls cheap and cheesy.  LOL  This one had him sitting in the chair with me.  I would have gave it 5 stars...but, they left me hanging at the end, wanting more.  Maybe the way they ended this, was to where they could make another??
0061715050|4.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe takes an adventurous journey through a mystical land, Narnia. As Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy learn of their royal inheritance, they must fight the evil witch of Narnia to claim it.     The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe will take your imagination to a place it has never been before with its mystical land, talking creatures, and suspenseful journey to a hopeful victory. After having visited Narnia only once, Lucy states, \\"It's a magic wardrobe. There's a wood inside it, and it's snowing, and there's a Faun and a Witch and it's called Narnia; come and see.\\"     If you like magical adventures and action, this book is for you. Narnia will captivate your mind as it takes you into a new world full or excitement. Twisting and turning, the journey of four young children through an unknown land to ultimately restore peace and claim their awaited thrones will keep you on edge the whole way through.     This book is easy to read. The sentences are short consisting of lower level vocabulary making this book perfect for kids. If you are looking for a serious, in-depth adventure of a similar sort, I would recommend J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. C.S. Lewis uses a simple writing style that makes the book very easy to understand, especially for youth. He also narrates the book like he is telling the story right there giving a homely feel to the experience.   The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an excellent read, quick and easy. I would rate this book high for plot and creativity. The value of the story is exceptional. If you have some free time and want adventure, this book is great and will satisfy your need.
B001USHRCK|5.0|This was purchased for my granddaughter's birthday (end of July), so she has not seen it yet.  This is another cool building because the back of this is open just like a doll house.
B004MNVKVO|5.0|Nice addition to my collection. Would of liked some \\"live\\" concert videos instead of the common studio ones on the 2nd disc. Sound is much improved over the original CD. You'll like it.
B003Q6BQPS|3.0|I'm saving this to give to my granddaughter for Xmas.  We love the other Creator sets that I've purchased, so I expect the same joy from this one.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This works good on my pocket knife, but not so much on my kitchen knives.  Maybe its the width of the blade or the quality of the steel.  Either way, for the money it's good in my book.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I loved this show the first time it aired on AMC. I was so happy to pick up the whole first season on DVD to enjoy again and again.    I was also very happy with the service I recieved from Amazon.com. I will definitely use this site alot more.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|No question I am a film noir, especially a crime film noir, aficionado. Recently I have been on a tear reviewing various <em>crime noir</em> efforts and drawing comparisons between the ones that \\"speak\\" to me and those that, perhaps, should have been better left on the cutting room floor. The classics are easy and need no additional comment from me as their plot lines stand on their own merits. Others, because they have a fetching, or wicked, for that matter, <em>femme fatale</em> to muddy the waters also get a pass. Of course when I think of noir it is 1940s-50s noir, black and white in film and in the good guys-bad guys constellation with a little murder and mayhem mixed in to keep one's eyes open just in case there is no <em>femme fatale </em>to muddy the waters. Neo-noir, such as the film under review, Sin City, is another matter, perhaps. Here's the why of the perhaps.    Central to the old time <em>crime noir</em> was the notion that crime did not pay and as stated above the bad guy(s) learned that lesson the hard way after a little mussing up or a date with a bullet. Kids' stuff really when compared to the over-the-top action of this three vignettes series on modern day good guys versus bad guys. Three separate male characters, all tough guys and guys you would want to have at your back if real trouble headed your way, are trying, trying within the parameters of common sense or believability, to clean up slices of Sin City. Sin City as the rather obvious name implies, is in the grips of corruption from the top down, including in virtually every civic institution. Our avengers are trying to cut a wedge into that bad karma by individually, one, tracking down a bizarre, politically connected heir whose thing was slice and dice of very young girls, two, avenge the death of a high class call girl who was kind to one tough guy, and, three, keep the pimps and cops at bay in the red light district where the working girls have set up their own Hookers' Commune.     All of this doing good is, of necessity in today's movie world, linked up with, frankly, over the top use of violence of all sorts from cannibalism to barbaric death sentences, well beyond what tame old time noir warranted. Apparently the succeeding crime waves since the 1940s have upped the ante and something like total war is required to exterminate the villains. That and some very up-to-date use of cinematography to give a gritty black and white feel to the adventures. And also a not small dose of magical realism, suspension of disbelief, and sparseness of language to go along with the plot and visual action.     But here is the funny thing, funny for an old-time crime noir aficionado, I really liked this film. Why? Well go back to the old time crime noir premise. Good guys (and then it was mostly guys- here some very wicked \\"dames\\" join in and I know I would not want to cross them, no way) pushed their weight around or tilted at windmills for cheap dough or maybe a little kiss. They got mussed, up, trussed up, busted up in the cause of some individual justice drive that drove the \\"better angels of their natures.\\" Guess what, sixty years later, a thousand years advanced cinematically, a million years advanced socially (maybe) and these guys are still chasing windmills. Nice, right.
B004I654WQ|3.0|There's really nothing wrong with this; it fits the mold as a smart kid's movie with enough subtle nudges and winks to keep the adults happy, a formula that Pixar has mined extremely well over the past decade and a half. It's even got that one weighty central topic, the moment the entire picture balances upon, when the collective audience presumably takes a sharp breath of air and has some sort of mini-epiphany in connecting it to their own lives. The major pieces are all there, truly, so why didn't I find this picture as rewarding as the rest of the animation house's legendary catalog? It's got something to do with the moments in-between. Usually, it's precisely those instants off the beaten path that Pixar absolutely swallows up, enveloping the screen with tiny jokes, dazzling visual wizardry and deep, circumstantial character development. In Cars, for whatever reason, the power in such moments is lacking. The studio goes through the motions, which makes for a more-than-decent facsimile, but in the end it doesn't feel as complete and engaging as their other masterworks. I would've loved it as a kid, and plan to share it with mine some day, but as an adult I'd rather throw in Toy Story or The Incredibles.
0061438294|4.0|What Every Body Is Saying is an excellent primer for learning about body language. I was not interested in body language at all until I saw the television show [[ASIN:B001QOGY54 Lie to Me: Season One]]. After seeing all of the different ways that body language can be read, I wanted to get a few books on facial expressions and body language. This is the first on body language that I have read and it is a good introduction. Even though it is a short read and written on the popular level, I can already read others much better than before. More importantly, I am more aware of my own body language and what I am communicating with it.<br /><br />After reading this, I am convinced that everyone should read at least one book on body language. Even if you only use a small fraction of what this book teaches, it will help improve many areas of your life. The photos throughout the book are very well done and help communicate the points effectively. The two negatives that I would point out in this book are the emphasis on law enforcement body language reading and the author's tendency to drag in some chapters. Would have been a better book with less text and more pictures. Recommended for everyone.
0307716511|4.0|\\"Sister\\" is a pretty good book by a new author.  It is well written, with good character development, and she defintely keeps your interest till the end when you find out \\"who did it.\\"
B005AUWY90|3.0|Having to explain to my 4-year old Cars-aholic daughter why bad guy cars were out to \\"kill\\" other cars in Cars 2 was a little unsettling and unexpected.  I was very surprised by the amount of automobile \\"deaths\\" and threat of \\"deaths\\" in the film.  Cars were always out to get other cars.  The spy genre was just not right for a Cars themed movie.  My daughter LOVES the firetruck character Red, but he only appeared, what?  A total of 2 minutes?  I felt so bad for her.  All those familiar and loved characters from the first film were castaways in Cars 2.<br /><br />With that all said, we still enjoyed the movie.  Finn McMissile became her newest favorite Car.  She even calls him Finn McMiss-Sile, as Michael Caine pronounces it.  We will still buy the BluRay and enjoy it at home.
0312323867|4.0|I'm a sucker for tales of redemption and Darcy's story is Redemption with a capital R. So extremely unlikable in the first book, Something Borrowed, you'll somehow find yourself rooting for her by the end of Something Blue (and I even like this book much better than the first!) The author does an exceptional job of taking us to the most uncomfortable places with her characters. They are always incredibly flawed, very frustrating, and tremendously human. If you like stories about people turning their lives around then I think you'll enjoy this one.
0307477479|1.0|I've read some of the reviews that called it the \\"smartest book you'll pick up\\" and \\"hilarious.\\"  Well, I don't get it.  It didn't make me laugh and it was so disjointed it was distracting.  Because it' was written this way I could have cared less about any of the characters.  There isn't enough time spent on them for you to care and they aren't really nice people to begin with.  Not worth my money or time.
B001GKJ2DE|5.0|So, I think my title says enough, but I would like to be a little critic in respect to some things.    *So first the movie, it is a great movie full with action (no too real, but cool) and some nice performances. It is not for all audiences since it has too much fiction, if you liked Matrix, you are on the right way. (not comparing of course)    *The set, well it comes with some cool thing, first of all the solid package with a bullet in the middle, loved it! The cards and all are not that amazing, and the target where the Blu ray is placed is a little cheap.  The best of all is the 3D film cell...just \\"amazing\\"! For this is the whole set worth it, besides the price can't be better.    So if you haven't seen the film, you like Action and Angelina Jolie, just buy it!
0857680986|5.0|I am happy to write that the Titan Book company has done an excellent job in re-printing one of the most important books on the art of drawing from the 20th Century. Andrew Loomis's book FIGURE DRAWING FOR ALL IT'S WORTH has been one of the most sought after out-of-print books on drawing in the field of commerical art. I have several copies of this timeless book printed in both 1956 and 1981 respectively. This current 2011 re-print is a welcomed addition to my library.    Titan Book's re-print of this Loomis Classic is well done; the paper is smooth and durable, the images of the artwork are clean and distinct and the size of the book is equal to that of the original printings. I have waited many years to find an affordable edition of this book that I could purchase and recommend to others to purchase, I have found such a book.    I am amply prepared to give my favorable review to this re-print. I hope it sells well in excess of its initial printing and has to be re-printed again.
B000VE439Y|3.0|After a 32 year wait I finally sat down and watched the 1979 cult film classic 'Monty Python's Life of Brian'. With the wait over I can honestly say I was neither surprised or disappointed, nor particularly amused or insulted. It was in fact pretty much what I had expected. Maybe I just don't get British humor, or maybe it's a problem with the heavy British accents. If I hadn't already been familiar with the religious context on which this satire is based I would have found large portions of the film all but unintelligible. Aside from the translation problem I found the truly funny moments in the story to be few and far between.<br /><br />Memorable Moments:<br />1-The stoning bit was hilarious,<br />2-The singing on the cross was a clever touch and<br />3-All the re-occurring joisting and one-liners between competing Judean liberation groups was amusing and probably the only thing that keep me watching.<br /><br />There were a few other good moments here and there but not enough to persuade me to endure a second viewing. I guess the comedy of Monty Python is an acquired taste that I apparently lack.
B003Q6BQPS|5.0|Our grandson is 12 and he has received LEGOs for every birthday and every Christmas for about 8 years.  Our granddaughter has a July birthday and just turned 11.  She couldn't think of anything she wanted for her birthday.  It's not that they have everything, she just has enough.  Her mom told me that she mentioned LEGOs last year at Christmas and had a LEGO Holiday Bakery on her list.  Naturally, it's out of season but I found it on Amazon!  We were going on vacation with them to the lake and I was not sure it would arrive in time, and was very happy it did!  The children shake their gifts and they always know when it's LEGOs...so they think!  I took the pieces out of the box and secured the bags of pieces so they wouldn't rattle. It was a gloomy day on her birthday, but not after she opened it!  It was a delightful surprise.  The bakery set was rated for 12 and up but she had no difficulty.  She was thrilled with every tiny piece as she put the items in the bakery window and loved the string of Christmas lights.  She was gracious enough to allow her brother to put together the boy with his head in the snowbank.  I love LEGOs because they allow and encourage the children to use their imaginations.  The stories they made up as they played with the family, imagining the snow and winter fun was priceless.  It's nice to see girls have fun with LEGOS.  It was a hit!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|As always I PITY the FOOL who just watches Harry. You need to read it too. This is a pretty good film and good set up for the battle of Hogwarts and final duel.<br /> I must say Hedwig had a much more heroic death in the film. In the book she just died in her cage.<br />But they should have used JK's dialogue between Harry and Ron about the deluminator.<br /><br />Ron: Dumbledore left it to me because he knew I would run out on you.<br />Harry: NO Dumbledore left it to you because he knew you would always want to come back.<br /><br />Or SOMETHING kinda like that, I can not seem to find it in the book now, but it was far more moving than the movie version.<br /><br />I am going to scribble on my scar with purple sharpie [ Dead center of my skull right between my eyes as JK intended.] Put on my round glasses, my black cape grab my wand and off to the final film. I MAY review it but who cares we have all read the book anyway.
032147404X|5.0|As a self proclaimed amateur photographer and owner of a mid-range DSLR camera, I can attribute much of my knowledge and skill in photography to this book as well as volumes 2 and 3. An absolute must if you just got a DSLR or are trying to figure out why you can't get the shot you want.
B001NHNG64|3.0|Jack Reacher helps a pretty young woman limping on a crutch with her dry cleaning and ends up kidnapped, along with the woman, by a white supremacist cult.<br /><br />Reacher's a great character and the writing is beautifully detailed, but the plot in this one fails to hang together.  The reader ends up running around the woods an awful lot, watching an increasingly difficult to believe series of escapes.<br /><br />Still, Reacher's intelligence and West Point education make him fascinating to follow.  It's not a bad book, but it cannot be rated very highly.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Nice, going to drama and keeping the universe intact.  But where's the humor?  It's what kept me watching the other two series.  Other than that not bad, but science fiction drama is not what viewers want to see or expect from StarGate on SciFi.
1451629184|3.0|I saw the TV interview of Jaycee and felt the book was just \\"okay\\". I have read several true crime books by Ann Rule, who is a fabulous writer on this subject. By comparison, this book was lacking. In particular, what I would have liked to have read more about was some background on Philip's life and Nancy's life. Ann Rule always focused on \\"why\\" deranged people did evil things, as opposed to the crime itself. I would have like to read how Philip developed into this monster and how Nancy became this person who felt that she had to go along with everything Philip did and did say that she still loved him in the end.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Nice to be able to have more apps available immediately! Simply wonderful! Keeps your scteens nice and organized. You wont be disappointed!
0385493622|4.0|I loved this book.  I bought it several years ago and have re-read it several times.  It reads like a mystery novel.  Its a fun and interesting read.
B004ZISVWC|5.0|If you ever see a 1-2 star review of this, make sure they can back it up. Trust me, they can't. I saw this last week in a limited screening in DC and loved it. We (The entire audience) laughed through the whole movie. A review had said, the entire movie is in the trailer?? He wasn't reading the subtitles then. There is so much humor in the plot and lines from the cast that you have to pay attention. It's not just the trolls that make the movie.<br />So now Christopher Columbus is supposed to be making an Amercian version? As an American I am insulted when movie makers think;<br />1. I am too lazy or stupid to enjoy a film with subtitles.<br />2. That director has an ego big enough to think he/she can make a better movie.<br />It's awesome in the original Norwegian dialogue.<br />What you get (in the form of a mocumentary):<br />We get college students who think this is all silly at the begining.<br />They learn pretty fast that it's all real. (not a spoiler we know this from trailers)<br />An ending press release that had the audience laughing as they left the theater. Stay for it all.<br />- Yes it is sort of Blair Witch with some cool special effects but to think of the film they made with the low budget is cool all around. It's so worth it to see the original.
B004R13U6Y|2.0|Used to think was the best but now it won't open lots of files that it used to and I can not save files anymore, I just get &quot;it is failed to save&quot; error.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|I wanted to like this movie, but it was a let down.  The acting was boring for me.  Gary Oldman could not save this picture and he's a fine actor.  I rented this movie and had I kown it was a little like watching the Twilight movies, I wouldn't have watched it.  The scenery was eerie, which was nice. I need more than that for me to enjoy the storyline though. Glad I rented instead of buying it.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|There has already been so much said about this book. It is very straightforward, and packed with facts and studies that reinforce the theory that exercise is good for your brain! It is not a simple read, but if you are interested in the subject, it is a page-turner!
0811875040|1.0|Such a pretty book. Recipes are all over the place.  Science degree needed to make a simple cupcake.  What a waste of time? I want my money back.
0553801473|3.0|Well, at least the wait is over. This book is what we waited 11 years for, and quite frankly, its a disappointment. GRRM's writing is just as good as ever, and there are some shocking/disgusting/heartbreaking chapters which are a joy to read. However, once again GRRM fails, or rather purposefully evades, advancing the plot a significant way. It feels like this book is just a giant filler filled with cliffhangers at the end leading into the next book.<br /><br />I am honestly quite shocked at how little happens in this book. You know there is something wrong when your skipping Dany and Tyrion chapters to read the new POV's, but in their 25 chapters, almost nothing happens! In other chapters, the pacing is better, but could still improved upon. It seems like GRRM feels compelled to take this small plot and transform it into a massive novel of 1040 pages, just so he can fit two extra books into this series.<br /><br />So the pacing is slow, but worse is that all the events taking place are largely irrelevant, predictable or extremely frustrating. Yes, for me, GRRM has become far too predictable. He seems to assume that everything going wrong is realistic, so in his universe, nothing ever goes right. Take Tyrion for instance, at the start of the book he plans to go to Mereen to act as an advisor to Dany. However, this being GRRM, we can assume that Tyrion defintely won't arrive at his destination, which is exactly what happens. Yes, he meets an interesting person on the way, but I can't imagine why anyone would want to read his misadventures with the dwarf Penny. What is GRRM thinking?! Its like a Series of Unfortunate Events in a fantasy world for adults.<br /><br />Other characters... Jon was forced to make idiotic decisions constantly, whereas Danerys was just frustrating. It seemed like George was forcing her to make strange decisions just to ensure that nothing would happen in her chapters. She made the ridiculous decision to remain in Mereen, shunned aside her dragons and married someone she should have known would backstab her. And Daario... I'm not sure whats more ridiculous about him, his purple facial hair or the fact his name has two a's.<br /><br />There are several new POV's. Two, in the north, are a joy to read. However, their stories end in a cliffhanger as well . Other new POV's, such as a Dornish Prince, are completely irrelevant and have no point in being there other than serving as filler. Arya's, Jaime's, and Cersei's POV's are short and feel like they should have been in AFFC rather than this.<br /><br />I hoped that by the end of this 11 year wait, at least some of the mysteries of the series would be resolved in this book. That doesn't happen, instead we have a predictable, frustrating, long and slow book filled with cliffhangers, violence, pointless talking, sex and more cliffhangers. There is a bit to chew on here, like the two POV's I mentioned above and one insane omg moment at the end of the book, but overall its far too little. It seems like George is just adding lots of filler to add another book in the series (six, or even five would have been more than enough.) He's also done himself no good (besides some good extra money) by waiting to release this after the amazing HBO show. The quality of this novel simply does not compare to the series or the first three books. Seriously, this is almost like Wheel of Time all over again.
B002ZG997C|3.0|The writers came up with an interesting premise on this film, but how much you buy into it could depend on your religious perspective. I thought it was novel and perhaps even a realistic idea for a futuristic film, but the movie starts to feel increasingly thin as it progresses.  Perhaps i would have liked it more had they trimmed 10 minutes out of it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Seeking vengeance for the loss of his love in the last film, James Bond (Daniel Craig) defies M (Judy Densch) to track down an important figure (Mathieu Amalric) in an international criminal organization who has some big plans in South America.    Given all the things that are wrong with this film, I like it more than I should.  The best thing about it is Craig, who makes a great Bond.  Unfortunately, the action scenes are quick cutting mash-ups that are often incomprehensible and the plot is one of those connect-the-dots affairs in which the hero travels from Point A to Point B, where someone tells him to go to Point C, where someone tells him to go to Point D, and so on.    Does everyone have to be darker and grittier these days?  Bring back the smooth, suave, womanizing Bond who can jump off a moving train without mussing his suit.  Craig is perfectly capable of playing him.
0545259088|3.0|I really enjoyed Shiver and Linger, the first two books in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. I was highly looking forward to Forever, hoping that this final book would take the best of the previous two and become something even better. Unfortunately, as it is with most trilogy enders, Forever didn't end this story in a way that satisfied me.<br /><br />Linger left the story off in a crazy, tense place which I'm sure made other series fans, like it did me, anxious for this next book. It was one of those cliffhangers that made it impossible not to wonder what would happen next. Forever never really got my emotions ramped up to that level, and the last book in a trilogy, that's kind of necessary. Even while the wolves are being hunted, I never felt scared for the characters.<br /><br />Things kept falling into place, which wrapped all the lose ends up nicely, but never let you worry for too long. I appreciate that the story made sense as a whole and they it progressed in a realistic way, but the wasn't much in the way of raw, powerful emotion. I anticipated something more, which I expect will be the case some other series fans as well.<br /><br />I dislike loose ends when a series finishes, but I actually would have liked Forever more if it had been a bit messier. Everything was so neatly ties up that it lost some its thrill for me. Forever is a good book, but it didn't blow my mind like expected.
1451629184|4.0|As a mother of an 11 year old girl, I found the sexual abuse this poor child endured to be unbelievably disturbing. It almost seems impossible. I hope Phillip Garrido has the same things done to him while he is in prison.  What a sick, sick man.  I wish Jaycee and her mother the best in her life.
0061537969|5.0|I read this as the first selection in my book club at work. I loved it from beginning to finish. It is beautifully written and full of sentiment, heart ache and laughter. I couldn't put it down and often laughed out loud, then having to explain myself to my family. It's a must read for dog lovers and animal lovers in general.
0812548094|1.0|I'm not one to do reviews, but I had to give my two cents worth for Stone of Tears.  I must say, I enjoyed Wizard's First Rule very much, as I'm a big fantasy novel fan.  I found I couldn't put the first book down, so naturally I was excited to continue the series.    Obviously (or I would think) you've read Wizard's First Rule if you're considering Stone of Tears, so I'm sure you enjoyed the MordSith (ha ha).  Goodkind did a great job of making you feel the story \\"in your stomach\\" on that one, which in my opinion makes him an incredibly talented author.  BUT I feel like he crossed the line on this one as far as I'd like to read.  Some situations were just a little too \\"sick\\" if you ask me.  I feel that an author does his best when he reaches that point where the reader's imagination takes over, but in Stone of Tears he pushes the envelope a little too far for my tastes.  I found some of the text downright revolting at times, and eventually just had to put it down.    I'll admit, I still give Goodkind credit for his writing skill, and we all have different opinions as this makes us different, but this was one book that stopped the adventure early on for me.  I hope you found this review helpful.
0307595862|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  Indeed, it was hard to pub it down; Nesbo's books are almost compulsively readable.  However, the plot was full of mind-bending coincidences and more red herrings than a stuffed Vita herring jar.  And then--and perhaps this is to be expected in a book that is meant to be read at supersonic speed--there was a major loose end left at the end; one of the murder victims remains unaccounted for--perhaps her murder will be solved in the next book!
B0055D3EOG|3.0|Strong opening but, all too quickly, the movie reverts to bad make-up and cheap thrills. Certainly not a movie that scared me. Watch it for its potential, or if you want to burn some time having a few (unintended) laughs.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This fits perfectly on my City Mini stroller by Baby Jogger. Love it. It can still fold perfectly and I love being able to carry a drink, my keys, and phone easier. Thank you!!
0783233477|5.0|I bought this for a birthday present for my mom. Its her fav movie and it arrived on time and was in excellent condition. No scratches on the disk. I highly recommend this seller. :)
B00005MM67|5.0|One-of-a-kind cinema I will always recommend.  Definitely aging, but still a great film worth viewing.  No, this ain't a documentary--and so it shouldn't be judged so harshly based on a few inaccuracies.  Overall a really entertaining flick, w/ a good combination of drama, realistic mountaineering, artistic camera work, and comedy.  Don't know if many would agree, but for some reason I find Michael Biehn to be f'n hilarious in this.  Haha, what a great fit for the role.  I originally borrowed the VHS from the public library on a whim when I was like 14.  Realizing years later that this was a badass movie, I just had to buy it!  (It's rare:  Specialty video stores like Scarecrow Video in Seattle have it available for rental, but that's about it.  None of the big dudes like Netflix or Blockbuster offer it)
0316154687|4.0|I had very little clue what to expect, behind this crazy cover other than some sort of \\"humor\\" because I'd never heard of David Sedaris until I saw him profiled on CBS Sunday Morning Show. They showed very long lines of people who were waiting to listen to David read his own books. I thought, \\"how bazarre that people would do that\\".  Now I understand that his work could only be grander.<br />I looked up his work on Amazon.com and chose the one that stood out for me.<br />When I cracked the book the first few pages had me a bit confused. It didn't take long to catch the drift.  The deeper I got the more I enjoyed.  He strikes me as a slightly twisted, (I'm sure he'd like that), Erma Bombeck with lots of dry humor and touching side notes while getting to know what seems like \\"the real him\\". Ultimately I've ordered four more of his books and I am holding my breath till they get here.  :)
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Very few films grab your eyes and glue them to the screen, within a few moments of viewing, this film is one rare example. The film that will make you get lost in its own atmosphere and then. all you care about, are the  characters, specially the main protagonist Daniel plainview, played with extreme brilliance by Daniel Day-Lewis, who once again, proves to be someone who is simply born for cinema.  Day-Lewis throws immense light on the characterization of Mr Plainview, infact we are forced to witness every situation, every circumstance from his eyes, a similarly powerful performence by Paul Dano, who within a very sho. Words will fall alone to describe the performances in this film, they are strong, moreover very genuine display of human natures. A fine masterpiece of a film, not to be missed.
0143117009|4.0|A warning from Diamond that if humans don't become better stewards of our planet, we too could fail. The choices are ours. In a somewhat detailed account, Diamond takes the scientific approach, providing the step-by-step analysis of the factors causing the demise of a number of cultures beginning with the situation in Montana's Bitterroot Valley. It presents an ominous sign of the future due to historic neglect, disagreements among newcomers and old timers as to possible solutions and lack of financing. Although \\"modern\\" in its causes and solutions, Montana's problems often parallel similar issues in older societies that once flourished in various parts of the world, such as Easter Island, Polynesia the Anasazi of SW U.S.:the Mayan culture of Mesoamerica and many others.  Recommended reading for all who care about future generations.
0765365278|4.0|I purchased this because I recently read and enjoyed the Mistborn novels by Brandon. This book was very slow to get started, but it looks like Brandon is setting up a lot of things that he will probably connect together later. The story picked up a lot for me after about halfway through and I am enjoying it more now.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. No matter how many times I've watched them, and its been several each, I am in awe.  I will update the blu ray versions as soon as they are released, but they can't possible be bad!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|This movie is the magical, emotional conclusion to the series that defined many childhoods. Yates once again proves his mastery of balancing story, action and magic in this finale of the series. It does not seem like it is a two hour movie, its pace is quick and draws the audience right in. Full of pithy lines, exciting battles and heartbreaking revelations, this movie does the series justice.<br /><br />By far the best!
0670022411|4.0|Well, I got the book and loved it. Now I'm reading these reviews and wondering what everyone else was reading.  I guess it doesn't matter.  I wasn't bored. I liked the pace of it and I was happy with the read.  Matthew is definitely hotter than Edward.
0062064304|5.0|I'll keep this short since there are 15 other 5 star reviews, but this is a model for what all other \\"art of\\" books should be. Complete design evolution of characters and weapons, along with photos of final Weta props. The book even shows a lot of the graphic design: everything from the alien language to the human corporations. So many awesome. Buy! Buy buy buy!
3551354014|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is studying German.  I had a little German myself, and the translation is nice.  It's a little startling, however, that the Dursleys are referred to as Mr. and Mrs. rather than Herr and Frau, and that all names are in the UK English, however.  With the care given to make an American English translation (for example, the American cars have trunks instead of boots as in the UK version, and Dudley's first American word is 'won't' instead of 'shan't'), I figured they'd totally German-ize ;-) the German version.  Perhaps in Europe they are so accustomed to the practices of nearby countries that it does not matter.  However, my daughter was thrilled, and so was I!
0894803123|5.0|I got this book for my dad as a gift and it has been a huge hit! He loved the background on how Ben and Jerry's got started and found the book very entertaining. As for the recipes, they are extremely easy to follow and get the hang of. It's great for learning how to make a base flavor (chocolate, vanilla, etc.) and then you can mix and match whatever add ins you want. Every time I talk to him, he raves about how good his ice cream is turning out! Would definitely recommend to others.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was such a good book. I read it in one sitting. There were so many emotions that it took you through. I did not know how it was going to end, but when I finally finished, it was just the ending I was hoping for. I was sad to finish the book because I felt like I knew the characters. I'm going to miss them. =) I would definately recommend this book. I loved it.
B0000041Z6|5.0|Mahler reviews are funny because you have a great many partisan points of view that are driven by reasons that go well beyond the listening of the music. I listened to the 4th symphony yesterday by Solti and the Chicago Symphony and I could not find anything but the most wonderful interpretation. Kiri Te Kanawa was sublime. The engineers were exceptional. The sound was clear, rich, perfect in every way! My small sorround sound 5.1 speakers never sounded better. Solti's approach was well thought out. The nuances were there. I would not want another performance. Challenge yourself and be honest. Forget the nonsense about Paradise and heaven or hell. Sometimes the libretos are part of the problem. This is really beautiful playing from an orchestra that was on top at the time. What a joy!!!!!!!! I listened to the 5th on Saturday.  The engineers were in top form throughout.  I am so happy I bought this set years ago.  Its great to compare these recordings to all of the new interpreters.  Solti and the Chicago are tough to beat!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I'm not sure why so many people (reviewers) found this book repulsive.  Yes, there were a number of errors in it (surprising because the book is so popular as is the series with movies, etc), but I have read a lot of ebooks and found that errors do seem to abound.  Many can be distracting, but I've decided to look for the storyline as much as I can and gloss over errors I cannot resolve while I am reading the book.  One can always complain to the author as most of them have email addresses that can be used at any time.    Now, on to the story ....  I love the resolution to this series.  Okay, so there is grossness here and there -- after all a knife wouldn't penetrate the sac around the little one -- and the name for the little one was a mouthful, but it was a sweet tribute to the two grandmothers and made it all a little more human.  That the middle name was after the two grandfathers was also endearing.  I guess I'm an old softy!  In fact, I am feeling sorry for anyone reading these reviews before the story as they give away certain very important parts to the story.  Sigh.  In spite of all those naysayers, I give two thumbs up to this series with a smile for the wrap up in this last book.  I loved it.
B004DMIIO6|5.0|This is an excellent movie. I originally saw this on netflix and liked it so much i bought it on blu ray. The picture quality for blu ray is much much better. I have read that some people have a problem with the cgi in this movie, i however don't see anything wrong in that. I feel that cgi can make a movie much better depending on how well it is done. For the most part the cgi is very well done. but there are a few scenes that i feel the cgi is kind of blurry looking. This is only in 1 or 2 scenes though, so it really doesn't affect much. This movie is definately worth checking out, but it isn't going to be for everyone. I suggest you view it on netflix first (if you have netflix) and decide from there if you should purchase it on blu ray. Overall i felt the plot, visuals, and quality of the film were great. 5/5 rating.

B002X02V02|4.0|Lady Gaga is extremely talented! She plays the piano, she sings, she writes songs and she is great at all of it! This is the first album of hers I have listened to, but it will not be the last because I am very impressed with \\"The Fame Monster.\\" This album is mostly comprised of hard dance tracks with a strong concentration on techno. Generally, I associate techno music with a good beat and lame lyrics, but Lady Gaga's lyrics are great and so are her beats. Music listeners need not worry about not hearing songs familiar to them because this album has plenty of hits. \\"Alejandro\\", \\"Telephone\\", \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"Paparazzi\\" are all here! All of the aforementioned songs are incredible, but out of the 22 tracks, most of them are incredible.<br /><br />I didn't dislike a single moment on this album. Some songs are a bit better than others, but that is to be expected when dealing with an album containing 22 tracks. Gaga's dance tracks are more likable than her ballads, but she still holds her own with ballads. Don't delay, music listeners, get your copy! I'm sure you'll love it!<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br />1. \\"So Happy I Could Die\\"<br />2. \\"Alejandro\\"<br />3. \\"Speechless\\"<br />4. \\"Paparazzi\\"<br />5. \\"Poker Face\\"

0780626494|5.0|'Blast from the Past' is one of those silly little films that gets a big boost from a very enthusiastic cast. The premise is a bit far fetched, but kooky scientist father Christopher Walken makes everything seem fairly plausible. Sissy Spacek plays his loving wife with superb comic ability and timing.<br /><br />The story of the above couple who escape (from what they think is the drop of \\"The Big One\\" )to their fall out shelter buried deep under their backyard is both silly and heartwarming. The film is part fish out of water and part romantic comedy and with the help of Brendan Frazer and lovely Alicia Silverstone as a modern day Adam and Eve so to speak, this film stays entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />Dave Foley plays Silverstone's gay BFF and he certainly adds a lot of hilarity in his supporting role. It's just one of those films that really grows on you if you're into such things. The 5 stars all turn in excellent and funny performances. The DVD has some interesting extras and the transfer looks decent, but this film is due for an upgrade.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|This is one of the best movies i've seen aaron echart in. he was absolutly awesome. this movie was awesome and the story was awesome. this is the best and the most realistic alien movie i've seen. great specila effects and all. If you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This show just keeps getting better with every season! I was a little wary of a new doctor after the awesome 3 years of Tennant but Smith delivers. I was also surprised at how quickly Smith made his own doctor whereas Tennant took a few episodes to find his character. Smith is quickly climbing up to Tennant in my book and the only reason they're not equal quite yet is probably because Smith hasn't been around as long. I like them both for different reasons; Tennant was more of a funny spaz at times and Smith is just hilariously weird. I'm also glad that they're using more Moffat stories because those are my favorite episodes from earlier seasons (Blink, Girl In the Fireplace). I especially like the River Song story arc and can't wait to see where that winding road leads. The new music is also even better!

0553801473|4.0|For The Winds of Winter. Of course Martin has again hooked me into hanging on for the next nail-biter, lathered and rabid to learn what is next to befall the characters I love and those I love to hate.<br /><br />Did ADWD answer all, or even most, of the questions I carry or even give proper time (in my opinion) to characters I desired progress and movement with? Well, no. Did the novel exceed my expectations by annihilating my expectations and proving that Martin is the master of ASOIAF? Without doubt. If nothing else this novel blew the lid off the scope I thought I had on this world, giving me a greater admiration for Martin's vision and ability to bring that to his audience with artistry. This is a great big world with great big characters and with this installment Martin proves again that his great big series has plenty of juice.<br /><br />Whilst I did read this one slower first time through (clever monkey catches the clues) I once again lost nearly a night of sleep as the final third of the book was inescapably un-put-down-able. Martin's lovely prose and careful character development are stunning in this installment, and he does offer fans a bit of karmic satisfaction, though admittedly not nearly enough for my bloodthirsty self. Of course there are even more cliffhangers and even less resolution with additional story-lines, but I prefer to look at it as all the more to love.<br /><br />I cannot fathom what it is that motivates some of the controversy and acrimony of some of the other \\"fans\\" and reviewers, especially those airing grievances about the time it took to publish, the fate of their fav characters, the Tolkien comparisons, the list of the utter ridiculous complaints could go on and on. I will not presume to speak to any of these but to say that in reading through the nay-saying I found myself struck by Martin's infamous \\"words are wind\\" line and how apropos the words feel in this instance. Stop whining and rise up all you irritated, short-changed readers and really stick it to the man: write and publish your own international best selling series, do everything right and show everyone how it is done. We will surely all be the better for your example.<br /><br />For my part, rather than taking Martin's decisions as the storyteller or the length of time he requires to produce a finished product as some manner of personal affront, I will thank the man for having a brilliant imagination and outstanding ability as a storyteller and hope he is at the bloody laptop at this very minute cranking out copious pages on TWOW.

B003UESJEM|3.0|This movie provides a glimpse, Hollywood-style, into what happens to the white-collar workers when the downsizing moves to their jobs. It is presented in the middle of what I've seen a few other films do: some films simply vilify the wealthy men and show them getting their just desserts of financial collapse. Others push for the mythical view of chivalrous wealth.<br /><br />The Company Men tries to shoot down the middle. One character is troubled by the damage caused to attain his wealth, but his solution is hardly self-sacrificing. There's the one who can't cope, there's the one who just doesn't care, and the one who survives because he's got a great wife. What else? Of course, the hard-working folks who aren't living in the upper-class lifestyle who go back and forth between sympathy and near-gloating.<br /><br />In all, the mainline of this film is that life at the top may be well-compensated but it's still empty. It's easy to lob stones up the line, that with all that money they should have been happy and all that, to think how much better off they were than others, but the truth is, the crisis is just as real. The bottom still hurts, however far the fall.<br /><br />The movie had some nearly funny moments: if the depiction of \\"outplacement\\" hadn't been so close to the corporate self-help nonsense I've seen in my own life, it would have been hilarious. Cady Huffman did an excellent job with the role she had there.<br /><br />Somewhat predictable, somewhat disturbing. Film earned its \\"R\\" due to language and brief nudity. The language was definitely there, the nudity was fleeting.
B004ZZS4CC|2.0|I really wanted to gain a new perspective about this horrendous tragedy.  However, it fell short.  I found the book to be quite dull and noticed that I started scanning the pages instead of reading them.  There was waaaay too much focus on her pets.  It was odd, I expected more information than what the newspapers gave, and this did not give anything more.  I noticed that some people stated that the book was very detailed and graphic.  I did not feel that way.  I have read romance novels that were more graphic.  Don't get me wrong I didn't want the graphicness but I felt that people were putting too much thought into their reviews.    I am glad that she was found and that she can try to have a \\"normal\\" life.  However, I found the book boring and lacking.  Perhaps, she should have stayed with her initial thoughts and not have published a book.
B000QUT9RY|3.0|Purchased because of optical input. Sound good for the price, and volume adequate for small spaces.<br /><br />Cones not protected, so handle carefully, if at all, and need original package to transport safely.<br /><br />Would have served for casual DJ use with my laptop were they not so fragile.<br /><br />With a protective front, I would have given them top rating. As is, the Logitech Z-2300 with a couple of old Realistic Minimus 7s, though a bit bulkier and without optical input, is much better.
B003UESJEM|3.0|It's pretty obvious in the first 20 minutes of the film (as well as by reading the back cover of the DVD) that a bunch of well to do folks are going to lose their jobs, and they're going to have trouble finding new ones. While the film does expand on a few more themes (the standard husband/wife/kids relationship, parents, blue vs. white collar, etc.), unfortunately, there's really nothing overly unique about the film. The main character, Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is this family man -- while we see shadows and the toils of tribulations of other higher level corporate types (Chris Cooper and Tommy Lee Jones.) At this point, you realize you're pretty much seeing microcosm of the 2010 financial crisis in the United States -- and that corporations are out to increases profits as much as possible, perhaps without the regard of the status of (formerly) successful employees. If you've been reading the news headlines of the past few years, the plot is quite predictable.    The middle of the film stagnates a bit -- we quickly know that Bobby is not going to find another similar position in the corporate world, but does find another opportunity in a vastly different industry. While embracing this new lifestyle, Bobby re-evaluates the world around him and finally takes stock in the change around him. Some of the other characters have a much harder time doing so, and there are significant consequences for them and their families -- reaching the denouement of the film. Craig T. Nelson's character, as the main antagonist, plays a good corporate president and shows little remorse towards those let go.    The ending is formulaic yet provides limited closure. Nonetheless, at the time I write this review the 2010 economic crisis still isn't resolved and hangs in the balance, much like this movie's conclusion. I've seen worse dramas and I've seen better -- the acting and casting is above average, it's just the story line that needs work, even though I didn't expect a happy ending.
B004BFM3CI|3.0|The 2nd DVD in the package won't always load in my DVD, and this is a problem exclusive to that DVD only. Non of my other DVD's (50 or so), ever have a problem when I load them. The music is GREAT, although I like the format of the previous CROSSROADS show better. To be fair, that format may not be possible with the larger turnout of musicians that are in this show. Steve Winwood was the only artist I was disappointed with, as the songs he did were also on the last CROSSROADS.
B00506NRBS|4.0|It's more like a long magazine article than a book but it's length is not directly proportinal to it's wisdom. Highly reccomended.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Such a happy ending to a horrific experience for Jaycee and her children.  The world IS scary, it is the repetition and practice that makes everything seem 'normal'.  For many years her 'normal' was the backyard, that is all she knew.  Going to the bathroom in a hole in the ground?  It probably seems weird to use a toilet now,and to go to the doctors.  Thank God the three of them never got really sick and had to go to the hospital.  The cameras will go away someday and you will feel free.  A movie would be good now while the book is out and then all the curious caring people in the world can feel releived you are free to live your life the way YOU want.
0553801473|4.0|I just got done with it last night on the Kindle. I thought it was 10x better than A Feast for Crows. Sure, there are a few slow parts, a few story lines that are less interesting than others, and never the resolutions you're hoping for, but it's an amazing piece of work and a joy to be back in Westeros (and Essos)!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Amazing and inspiring memoir. VERY candid and may not be for everyone. I did find her strive for survival simply amazing. Love the line at the beginning stating ask yourself: what would  you do to survive? Jaycee also states this isn't for everyone and if you want a less confusing book that's well put together come see her in ten years when she has things a little more together! Ha loved that and this book.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|Clyde (Gerard Butler), a former Black Ops tech, watches his wife and child die in a home invasion. A law-abiding citizen, he turns to the Justice Department for help, but instead of Justice he gets Nick (Jamie Foxx) a slick Assistant District Attorney whose only motivation in life is maintaining his 96% conviction rate.<br /><br />Nick, seeing holes in Clyde's eyewitness case where there are none, and fearing his numbers might go down, does a deal with Darby, the actual murderer (who gets three years for hacking Clyde's wife and daughter into bloody little pieces) to send Darby's accomplice (who never touched them) to the Death House.<br /><br />Ten years go by, and Darby's accomplice is put to death by lethal injection. Something goes horrifically wrong, and the man dies screaming and writhing before a roomful of witnesses. At the same time, Nick's family gets a FedExed DVD of a man in a mask hacking Darby into, not coincidentally, little bloody pieces. Nick is such a self-absorbed law-and-order ass that he doesn't come home from work when his hysterical wife calls him, much less attends his Elementary School-aged daughter's first Cello recital.<br /><br />Clyde is arrested on suspicion of the deaths of the two miscreants, and is sent to jail without bail to await trial. While Clyde is in jail, people connected with the Darby verdict continue to die spectacularly (my favorite is the judge, who is shot through the head by her own cellphone).<br /><br />So begins LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, an F. Gary Gray film which, despite its action movie veneer, asks serious questions about the nature of justice and the justice system. There is nobody who doesn't agree that the system is a creaking monstrosity that doesn't work right. Just as in LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN, overburdened or overly ambitious prosecutors make deals that mock the ideas of punishment and rehabilitation, the death penalty is wrongly sought (leading to acquittals) and applied (leading to miscarriages of justice), and ultimately justice is not done, either upon victims or upon the accused and/or convicted.<br /><br />LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN is about the right of the individual to ensure that justice be done. Neither Clyde nor Nick is particularly likeable here, and neither is entirely right nor wrong. The storyline is highly implausible anyway. But, like many other reviewers, I found myself very disappointed in the ending, where Nick finally outsmarts Clyde. This unsatisfactory ending costs LAW-ABIDING CITIZEN two stars (at least). It would have been far better had Clyde chosen the ending of this story, leaving the chastened Nick to gather lessons from amongst the ashes of his own self-righteousness.e, either upon victims or upon the accused and/or convicted.

0553801473|3.0|There are too much uninteresting characters and side-plots. The main plot does not advance enough and is buried in a see of useless fillers. I think the author should have made book 4 and 5 into one book, it would have been faster to write and more interesting to read.<br /><br />The good news is GRRM has no choice but to end side-plots has we get close to the saga conclusion in book 6 and 7.  I once taught the TV series could combine book 4 and 5 on the same timeline and then show it over 2 seasons. But after reading ADWD, the TV series should just slash 50% of the material and cover book 4 & 5 in season 4.

I said \\"no, I'm just trying to get to the point when something happens\\". By the time I was 6 chapters away from the ending, I just said \\"screw it\\" and simply read last page of every chapter. Seriously. 6 years in writing, over a THOUSAND pages and the plot advances by five baby steps?<br />TDWD is extremely disappointing.<br /><br />PS: It's sad to admit that I'm more excited about second season of HBO series than about the next book.

0553801473|1.0|Why has this book been highly rated by national critics?<br /><br />The answer is because George RR Martin continues to astound us with his world building. And that is what critics love. They want a book immersed in the minute details, they want to be able to imagine themselves in the book. They want to smell the smells, eat the food, and watch the sights. And this book delivers that in droves. Add a dash of oppressiveness and this book becomes an instant classic amongst the criticatti.<br /><br />This is also precisely the reason I hate this book. There is too much detail, and this is not what I (as a fan) do not want to read. Is this a food guide or fantasy fiction? I would rather watch the Food Network than read about the excrutiating details of each meal. Is this a travelogue or fantasy fiction? I would rather buy Fromer's guide to Westeros than read about the boring nature of traveling from one place to the next where nothing (important) happens in between.<br /><br />As a result, we get hundreds of pages of filler. It delights the critics but it bores the heck out of me. I don't care where whores go nor do I care to read about urinating into rivers.<br /><br />Admittedly, the action picks up 75% into the book, and the last quarter of this book is actually readable. However, this means that 250 pages is actually fairly good and the remaining 700 pages could have been cut out without impacting the book.<br /><br />The saddest part of this is that we will need to wait another five years for \\"Gorge\\" RR Martin to write the next installment of the foods that he dreams about.<br /><br />As a huge fan of this series (hey, I have not only the board-game, but the expansion for it!), I'm sad to say that if this were book one, I would not have read book two.

The pages of the Kindle copy are practically solid yellow from highlighting and I cannot wait to put many of the strategies into place.

0553801473|4.0|I enjoyed this book, part 4b of the series, although I agree with many of the critics, too long, unnecessary new characters, little resolved.  But I love the series, first 3 books are 5 stars... I would really rate this a 3 1/2.<br /><br />My question however is this:  I have heard there are two more books before series ends....  George RR Martin is 64 years old and it took 6 years to release this tome.... Does he have it in him, especially with the other distraction of the GREAT HBO series, Game of Thrones, which I have heard he is also very involved, to finish 2 more 700-1000 page books....?<br /><br />Or is this another job for Brandon Sanderson, the person who is now finishing the late Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series... Good Luck George...!!!

0545123291|4.0|Linger is the sequel of Shiver, and it follows Grace and Sam's story after he was cured. Although Shiver wasn't one of my favorite books, I wanted to know what would happen with Sam and Grace.<br /><br />In Linger, Sam and Grace are still very much in love and want to be together forever. They are a very sweet couple and their relationship is almost perfect, expect for Grace's parents and her \\"disease\\".<br /><br />The book is still written from Grace and Sam POV, but it was refreshing to read Isabel's and Cole's thoughts too. They were very interesting, more than Grace, because I felt like I knew what was going to happen to her.<br /><br />The writing was lyrical, almost poetic. It's perfect for this romance, but sometimes for me it was a too descriptive and dramatic.<br /><br />What doesn't really grabs me are the characters, their feelings. They are always like depressed, even when good things happens to them (ex. Sam). They are too intense and sometimes were too much for me. Maybe that's way Isabel was my favorite this time, she has big troubles but is much more practical and strong.<br /><br />But, I have to admit that the author managed to convert this book in not another book about werewolves, but a sweet and heartwarming story.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I read Linger. I wasn't so sure after reading Shiver, but I think this book is much better. It's romance, mature, with a little bit more of action and an ending that left you wanting more.
B000001DYD|5.0|I love this album, I think it's probably better than they say: it's got the magic of early blues.  She evokes whole worlds and universal situations with a few seemingly simple lines that are anything but simple.  And the playing rocks--they play it like they absolutely mean it, it spits blood, it's what it's all about.  It's not whiny or angry for its own sake or indulgent in any way, not \\"art punk\\" or whatever, just dead honest about the big stuff, passion, compulsions, one's own bs.  She puts it out there.  Some people hate the production--you will too, unless you play it very loud, then it makes perfect sense.
1451629184|5.0|I, like a lot of other people, read this book within a day.  My heart goes out to Jaycee and her daughters.  Unlike some reviewers, I am amazed that Jaycee with her 5th grade education wrote this book and conveyed the absolute horrors she endured at the hands of a madman and his wife.  Not only did she survive, she has an amazing outlook on her reclaimed life. I don't know of many adults who could've gone through everything she has and still be loving, caring and not filled with hate.      I did not find the talk of her pets unnecessary to her story.  These pets helped her through her imprisonment.  Everytime they gave her a pet, then took that pet away was another form of control over   for her.  I honestly think it helped me understand the many forms of mental torture she experienced at such a young age.      As a 37 year old woman, reading this book makes me want to pull her into my arms and give her a hug and let her know that she did what she had to do to survive a horrific situation.      I support Jaycee in making her dream come true of being a best selling author.

0596805527|4.0|This text, in all of its editions, has maintained a valuable spot on my bookshelf for over a decade.  It's also the text I assign my students in an advanced client side scripting course I teach.  Obviously, I like this book, and I have a whole lot of respect for the author, who does a great job at explaining the language, particularly the many often misunderstood parts, in unparalleled detail and clarity.  There's no questioning the high and incomparable value of information contained inside.  It's famous and truly indispensable among us client-side coders, and therefore, I can give it no less than 4 well deserved stars despite the limitations which follow.   That said, it's not perfect and not a truly comprehensive source of information as other reviewers represent it as being.  There are holes in this text that will need to be filled from other sources.  Probably by design rather than oversight, Flanagan falls short on best practice information.  As Javascript matured, editions of this book has kept up with new features but they fail to keep up with the changes in the way we use it.  Common non-intuitive practices have been established to accommodate large scale web applications which are now common and these practices are not included in the book.  I consider this an unfortunate omission and necessitates companion book(s) to get the full picture (such as Stoyan Stefanov's Javascript Design Patterns and Douglas Crockford's Javascript the Good Parts).  With regards to the newly added server-side section, I think Flanagan would have been better off focusing completely on client-side as opposed to trying to squeeze in Node as well.  Looking ahead, I don't see this all-in-one approach being feasible for future editions as Node continues to grow in breadth and complexity... it will just be too much for a single book.  Even now, while I love the eventsource and websocket server-side demos, they were just too brief and didn't really demonstrate practical use of Node.js for real multi-page websites or come close to the comprehensive detail given to the client side.  The examples worked fine and demonstrated how you could quickly hack a small project together, but that's about it.  It wouldn't have taken much space to include information about Content Delivery Networks, gziping, minification, layering, and build tools, so I'm surprised this was left out.  These concepts, especially as libraries and modules are integrated from third parties, are absolutely critical to performance of modern web applications.  There are also some smaller strange omissions that are hardly worth mentioning... I'm only doing so hoping they will be read and noticed + included in the next editions:  - Regular expression chapter has no examples of positive and negative lookaheads.  This is frustrating considering these are usually the most difficult features to grasp.  - No xpath? (document.evaluate). Seems like this alternative should at least be mentioned along with Selectors API given how widely it's implimented.  - I get why Flanagan chose JQuery as the Javascript library to go over in this book--it's the most popular library out there.  By the way it was decoupled from the rest of the book, I assume its inclusion was either a last minute decision or one that might be corrected in the future if its popularity falters.  Like server side content however, I just feel this book is an odd place for this information.  Especially given the number of other high-quality library out there that aren't primarily for DOM manipulation (i.e. are relevant beyond the browser).  Other libraries are much better suited for certain tasks such as class based design (dojo, mootools, yui), utilizing future ecmascript features today (mootools), integrated build tools, etc.  - Personally, I don't find the last 300+ pages of reference material in the back of the book useful at all. This information would be much better presented online in an indexed+search, and I'd be happy to seeit removed/replaced in future editions as well. Save the paper!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|So this is the end of a eight movie long, decade run of films that has somehow managed to not have a stinker in the bunch. With Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, the movie series comes to a very satisfying conclusion. Make sure you are up to date on the other movies, especially the last two. You will probably still enjoy it, but you won't know what in the world is going on, other than the fact that Harry and Voldemorte are going to fight by the end.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of what David Yates done directing the last four Harry Potter movies. I liked all the films, but it seems he lacks the ability to give every character the proper amount of screen time and he drains out some of the fun by using a darker looking color for filming, to go along with the much darker material. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1 was good, although I found it rather slow, spending too much time with the kids running around in the woods, but it was more of a setup for the chaos that Part 2 delivers.<br /><br />You want tons of action without sacrificing the emotional connection? Got to love that Snape flashback sequence. Yates got it right this time. I'm having a hard time ranking any of the previous 7 movies ahead of this one. How often can you say that about any long running series? The visuals are better than ever and the musical score is the closest thing to what the great John William's accomplished in the first three Harry Potter films. Most of the cast, roles big and small, are back and it feels almost like we know them personally by now. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have grown before our eyes sure, but the real magic is in how they have grown as actors. Alan Rickman as Snape is still my favorite character in the series. Nobody could play that part any better. Ralph Fiennes also does an excellent job turning up the menace as the snake nosed Voldemorte.<br /><br />The movie ends with an epilogue set 19 years later. They re-shot this segment after seeing how silly the old age prosthetics looked on the actors, but the CGI touches they ended up going with were good in being less distracting, though they looked maybe 5-10 years older tops.<br /><br />It's sad to see this franchise end, but through the power of Blu-ray or whatever muggle invention the future holds, Hogwarts will always be a button or two away.<br /><br />By the way, I saw it in IMAX 3-D and I don't feel it was worth the extra cash. If it was filmed with IMAX cameras or at least shot in 3-D it would have given Transformers: Dark of the Moon a run for it's 3-D visuals.osthetics looked on the actors, but the CGI touches they ended up going with were good in being less distracting, though they looked maybe 5-10 years older tops.

B000002LAB|4.0|`Tutu', released in 1986 was one of Miles' last works and defines his later, `electronic' period. Sometimes criticised for being more the work of the highly talented multi-instrumentalist Marcus Miller than of Miles himself in the same way that `Porgy and Bess' and `Sketches of Spain' might be seen as `Gil Evans Albums', nevertheless Miles' signature style and virtuoso trumpet playing define Tutu's principle character.<br /><br />The history of this project is that Miles' new contract with Warner Brothers stipulated that all songwriting credits henceforth should belong to WB rather than to Miles himself. To get around this legal irritant Miller was hired to compose the main theme for each piece as a framework over which Miles could solo, and took all legal songwriting credit. Miller has been described as \\"A producer who could play as well as a player who could produce\\" and did a good job: the resulting electronic rhythms and synth-dominant sound gives `Tutu' a distinctively 1980s feel which leads some to claim that Miles had `re-invented' jazz for the fourth or fifth time in his illustrious and multiply-groundbeaking career of continuous innovation. Well, that's stretching things a bit: `Tutu' is OK but hardly `great', in the same way `Do-Bop' is OK but not really a classic.<br /><br />`Tutu' was certainly a new, fresh sound in 1986 and unlike anything else at the time which could be found under the `jazz' category. The album has a lot of energy and Miles' trumpet playing is as inventive and energetic as ever. However after several numbers it can begin to sound samey, and in the context of Davis' long career and particularly high-points such as `Kind of Blue,' `In a Silent Way' and `Bitches Brew', `Tutu' is justifiably seen by most (but not all) fans as a second-tier effort and not really one of his best works. The album is, however, easily accessible to the new-to-jazz listener and even to people who profess to `not like jazz' but are OK with high-energy electronic instrumental music, and so offers a gateway to the deeper and more interesting musical milestones of the genre.<br /><br />RIP Miles. You never failed to surprise and delight us, even with your more hit-and-miss projects like `Tutu.'instrumental music, and so offers a gateway to the deeper and more interesting musical milestones of the genre.<br /><br />RIP Miles.

Feast was also a brilliant little book that Dance improves upon. New themes come to us in the form of disease, new Targaryen claims, and the fact that winter is, indeed, actually coming.<br /><br />All the setup in Feast and Dance is more than preparing us for what is no doubt going to be the best fantasy book ever, The Winds of Winter. Check it out!

B000002JKA|5.0|\\"Awake\\", Dream Theater's fourth album, is just another example of just how awesome Dream Theater really is. This album is downright incredible, an album that is another one of my favorites.    \\"6:00\\"    Although this is a great song, it is actually one of my least favorites. But, I still find it to be a really good song.    \\"CAUGHT IN A WEB\\"    This song is a must-listen for every diehard Dream Theater fan. I never turn this album off without hearing this song first.    \\"INNOCENCE FADED\\"    Another favorite song of mine.    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": I. EROTOMANIA    Though, split up into 3 separate tracks, \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" is actually one full-length song, clocking in at 20:26. \\"Erotomania\\" (which clocks in at 6:48) is, obviously the first portion of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\".    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": II. VOICES    Here is, what would be, the second portion of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" (clocking in 9:53).    \\"A MIND BESIDE ITSELF\\": III. THE SILENT MAN    The final portion of \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\", \\"The Silent Man\\" (clocking in at 3:45). \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" is one of my all-time favorite Dream Theater \\"Epics\\". Dream Theater has been very well-known for their lengthy \\"Epic\\" tracks, and \\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" is no exception.     \\"THE MIRROR\\"    Awesome track. Way too awesome to describe.    \\"LIE\\"    Another one of my all-time favorite Dream Theater tunes.     \\"LIFTING SHADOWS OFF A DREAM\\"    Another song that is way too awesome to describe.    \\"SCARRED\\"    Great track.    \\"SPACE-DYE VEST\\"    One of my personal favorites from this album.    As I stated before, \\"Awake\\" is another great example of just how amazing Dream Theater really is. This is album needs to be in your collection if you are a diehard fan.     NOTE: This album was Kevin Moore's final album with Dream Theater. Kevin was Dream Theater's first keyboardist, where he left the band shortly after they finished recording this album. According to Mike Portnoy, Dream Theater's now ex-drummer, Kevin was growing very distant from the band on a personal note. Professionally, Kevin was more into doing things on his own, rather than having to make compromises with the other four guys (James LaBrie - Vocals, John Myung - Bass, John Petrucci - Rhythm & Lead Guitars, and Mike Portnoy - Drums).

B000002HK4|5.0|Dream Theater's fifth album, \\"A Change Of Seasons\\", is another amazing masterpiece. The album contains only one original \\"Dream Theater\\" studio-recorded compisition (the album's infamous 23-minute epic title track), and four live cover performances (all of which were performed on January 31, 1995, at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London).    \\"A CHANGE OF SEASONS\\": I. THE CRIMSON SUNRISE / II. INNOCENCE / III. CARPE DIEM / IV. THE DARKEST OF WINTERS / V. ANOTHER WORLD / VI. THE INEVITABLE SUMMER / VI. THE CRIMSON SUNSET    Dream Theater continues with their amazing lengthy \\"Epic\\" legacy with this downright incredible title track. This track was actually written back in 1989, but it was considered for the \\"Images And Words\\" album. When being considered for the \\"Images And Words\\" album, the track (from what I've read) was 17:00+ long, being deemed to long, by the album producer, to go on the album. In 1993, Dream Theater did perform this song twice in concert (obviously two different concerts). Fans loved the song and actually created petitions, requesting that the band officially record the song. That final recording is what you hear right here.    Medley: \\"FUNERAL FOR A FRIEND\\" / \\"LOVE LIES BLEEDING\\" (Live)    This track is one of many cover performances Dream Theater had done back in January of 1995 at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. Now, I am not an Elton John fan, but the guys perform this medley extremely well. I believe Elton would be proud if he had heard it (that is if he hasn't heard it, yet).    \\"PERFECT STRANGERS\\" (Live)    Another live cover from Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club. This is an incredible performance of a Deep Purple classic.    Medley: \\"THE ROVER\\" / \\"ACHILLES LAST STAND\\" / \\"THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME\\" (Live)    When I first heard this live performance, it completely blew my mind. Dream Theater knows how to pull of Led Zeppelin.    \\"THE BIG MEDLEY\\": IN THE FLESH? / CARRY ON WAYWARD SON / BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY / LOVIN', TOUCHIN', SQUEEZIN' / CRUISE CONTROL / TURN IT ON AGAIN    This is one of the best medlies I have ever heard, with Dream Theater performing \\"In The Flesh?\\" (originally by Pink Floyd), \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\" (originally by Kansas), \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" (originally by Queen), \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'\\" (originally bu Journey), \\"Cruise Control\\" (originally by The Dixie Dreggs), & \\"Turn It On Again\\" (originally by Genesis).    Believe it or not, \\"A Change Of Seasons\\" was the first Dream Theater CD I have ever heard, which is why it holds a special place in my heart. This album (though, really an EP in name) is pure amazement, and it should be in the collection of every Dream Theater fan.    NOTE: This marks the first Dream Theater album to be recorded with keyboardist Derek Sherinian. Derek Sherinian was originally hired in 1994 when Dream Theater were about to embard on their 1994 \\"Waking Up The World Tour\\", where Derek was to be just a fill-in on keyboards. A few months into the tour, Dream Theater discovered that Derek was exactly what they had been looking for, which led Dream Theater into hiring Derek Sherinian as a full-time member, where he officially replaced Kevin Moore.
0345529057|5.0|I hadn't heard of this series until the HBO hype, unfortunately.  But, I got all four for $20 to give them a shot and they're fantastic.  They're long, but I don't realize it until I already finished with 200 pages at a time.  Every chapter leaves me in awe.  My husband doesn't like gut-wrenching suspense as much as I do and I doubt I would let kids read them.

B00337KM2S|5.0|A very strange film that proposes no way out in the crisis situation which is part of everyday life in the USA: firing and getting fired. Today quite a few businesses have outsourced the processing of these firing procedures. So a business specialized in firing people comes into the picture to do it properly, to make limbos presentable and hell palatable, heaven-like if you want, with some nice words and a lot of mind manipulation.<br /><br />These professional firers are plane people who can fly nearly 320 days a year and spend exactly 7 times 24 hours boarding planes in one year. They have very strict requirements about traveling light and traveling on light and flexible wheels. Home is airports all over the USA, some day all over the world. And they learn how to live with light sushi, and accepting or refusing a \\"cancer\\" when the stewardess proposes them \\"a can, sir\\".<br /><br />They thus learn how to wrap up horror and death on a slow fire and so many other evils in the shiny suits of rebirth, a new beginning, an opportunity to excel in a new field of creativity. They forget the suffering they are going to create or even the death they are peddling day after day, be it jumping from a bridge, or slow poisoning on alcohol, or just triggering some fire arm.<br /><br />But on the other side the younger ones out of Cornell University or some other high-rise higher education schools are just developing a new technique based on the Internet and communication tools and technologies to dehumanize firing by making direct contact, even be it only eye contact, impossible since two screens, two cameras, two mikes, two modems and a telephone line are between the firer and the firee. That's what  they are told and taught in these deluxe schools that can wrap any crap in gold to make us think it is a nugget or a piece of chocolate.<br /><br />But Clooney brings another dimension in his airport ever perambulating home: that is to say just not being alone. Of course in those terminals and in those planes you can always find some human contact, be it purely professional and paid for, or be it some person casually met in a bar or restaurant, or for the more deprived be it only a chambermaid, or as for that a chamber-\\"valet\\" or plain janitor. But he shows us how at one moment in this life the traveler will want some more permanent or regular contact and meeting. But that is nothing but an appearance meeting an appearance and hell it is for the one who believes this appearance, on this side or on the other side, is the real thing. Harder will the fall be, and harder is the fall.<br /><br />A small film showing the total artificiality and somewhere absurdity of that civilization based on transience and mobility and rootless-ness and professional distance and non-empathy. Cruel but absurd. Samuel Beckett at its highest acme.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUan always find some human contact, be it purely professional and paid for, or be it some person casually met in a bar or restaurant, or for the more deprived be it only a chambermaid, or as for that a chamber-\\"valet\\" or plain janitor.

B004EPZ084|4.0|\\"Horrible Bosses\\" is a very funny and very raunchy film. Three downtrodden employees hate their despicable bosses and conspire--with the \\"help\\" of \\"M.F.\\" Jones (amusingly played by Jamie Foxx)--to kill them. The bosses are very good at being crumby to their underlings, but their victimized workers are quite inept at murder.<br /><br />The actors playing the bosses have the meaty roles, and they all handle these wonderfully. Kevin Spacey keeps Jason Bateman on a leash with promises of a promotion, getting him to do pretty much anything he wishes; Jennifer Aniston is a nymphomaniacal dentist, who sexually harasses Charlie Day, her dental assistant; and Colin Farrell is a greedy, callous, and perverted crud, who is hated by Jason Sudeikis.<br /><br />There are a number of comic twists and turns, with the murder plots going right, then wrong, then right, then.....<br /><br />This is a film that will make you laugh a lot, with the excessive behavior of the hateful bosses leading to most of the laughs.

This isn't quite the biter taste in my mouth that I had with Feast but its not a pleasant sensation either.  How can a book that is nearly 1000 pages feel like it 300 pages to short?<br /><br />The story is good when it centers on the north<br />Devros, Bran, Reek and John and the Ironborn<br /><br />Middle of the road is probably Tyrion who doesn't do much except travel from one place to another and never quite arrives at the place he needs to be.  I also have to give credit where I can in the three Cersei chapters we are presented with she manages to come across as less intense and insane then she did in Feast.<br /><br />There were also several more POVs that were captivating its two bad we only had 2 max of each of them.<br /><br />Downright frustrating is Daenerys who regresses quite a bit in this book and it is just as confusing that in the end Martin simply pushes the reset button.  I guess dealing with the knot by...not dealing with it yet is one way to manage it.<br /><br />Overall-Martin writes really well and that is almost enough to mask the fact that nothing of many major substance is accomplished in this installment.  If anyone has read the Dark Tower by Stephen King you should be familiar with the feeling.  The first books were full of much promise but considering what this series has evolved into I can't recommend getting emotionally invested.
B003VON1S0|4.0|Just bought the MP3 album and I love it so far. My only complaint is that track 5 (Curse My Name) has a strange high pitched whine that I've never noticed on any album before. My speakers aren't the best (JBL Creature 3) but I don't think they're the source of the problem because the artifact also shows up on my ipod mini. Running the track through Audacity and using the AUGraphicsEQ to drop everything above 16khz fixes it. Please let me know if you've noticed this. The whine only happens for about 30 seconds around 3:20 of track 5.    Otherwise definitely buy this album. It's my first BG album coming from Demons & Wizards and Iced Earth. :)    Edit: Just noticed one of the other reviewers mentioned this as well. Glad I'm not the only one.
B003WTE886|5.0|I think that this is Taylor's best album yet.      I think the best songs are Sparks Fly, Dear John, Mean, The Story of Us, Never Grow Up, Enchanted, Better Than Revenge, Haunted, and Last Kiss... which is basically every song.
B005AUWXZ0|5.0|I couldn't believe my eyes: 6 1-STAR REVIEWS???? SERIOUSLY???   I just saw Cars 2 about a few hours ago, and this amazing movie has taken my breath away and stolen my heart. Oh, where do I start? How about that story! It's the craziest idea I've ever heard of and would've never imagined that the long-anticipated sequel to the equally amazing Cars would be a spy thriller! But it's a good kind of crazy, you know? It's hillarious, touching, and edge-of-your seat awesome, more so than the usual animated movie. One thing I loved about this one was that they let Mater take the spotlight for this. He plays a larger role, much more than the sweet, loveable sidekick (not that he still isn't) he was in the first one. He even gets a chance to prove that he's actually got brains under that hood of his (even though he doesn't have one... LOL). The action was amazing, the suspense made me grip the edge of my seat, the humor kept me laughing 'til I cried, and it was filled to the brim with surprises. Let me tell you this: Pixar is an amazing company, they are some of the most talented storytellers in the universe and haven't yet disappointed me with their amazing films, and they probably never will! This film is insanely amazing and takes you places you could've never imagined. If you loved the first and the shorts, you'll love Cars 2. KA-CHOW!
1433527189|5.0|For most of my Christian life I have always been NIV-positive. Someone introduced the ESV Study Bible to me about a year ago and I haven't reverted back to my NIV Bible ever since. I have understood that the ESV is a revised version of the RSV and perhaps the most accurate English translation of the Bible to date. Similar to the Tyndale English Bible, it captures both the thought-for-thought and word-for-word translation better than any other English version. This study version has excellent commentary from notable Bible scholars, theologians, and seminary professors throughout the English speaking world. I highly recommend this study Bible to any Christian ready to dig deeper into God's Word.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Having worked for a production company as an audio technician I can tell you that this inexpensive little microphone will solve all but about 5% of all audio applications. Today I use it to produce a \\"How To\\" series for leather crafters. If the audio wasn't any good I can assure you I would have heard about by now.
0440241901|2.0|I first read this book about a year ago and was left underwhelmed. I came across it again as I was looking for a light summer read and decided to give it another chance. Let's just say I now fully remember/understand why I didn't like it in the first place. The only thing the book has going for it is some of the laugh-out-loud moments, which are the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one. Everything else is annoying and just way too unrealistic.     The main character, Emma, though hilarious at times, is juvenile, immature, not very smart and downright annoying. The author does not give the reader any reason why we should root for her. In fact, some of the things she does or says are so moronic, after the first few chapters, I was ready to smother her!    Another disappointment is the male lead. Never do we really understand why in the world he is attracted to someone like Emma. Also, I never really got a sense of him, and not just in terms of his physical appearance (how old is he? what does he look like?).     Was the book a good laugh? Yes, some parts are truly funny. Is it worth reading? If there really is nothing else for you to do, if you don't have any other books lying around and if you really, really, really are desperate for something to read, then yes. Otherwise, find something else.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|We must recognize the seventies was the decade of the great dare devils. One on one hand, Evil Knievel, making the riskiest numbers with his bike and then the tightrope walker Philippe Petit starring at 1350' high true an unthinkable urban feat far from simple circus jugglings.<br /><br />This epic documental captures with maxim eloquence the irrverence, efforts and inner tensions that accompanied this singular human being, who bet everything for being there at the top of the world.<br /><br />Petit - as well as most of these intrepid beings - crossed over the land of the forbidden, rules and this universe of current conventions to make his dream come true.<br /><br />Something inside me, took me back to that well reminded film of Robert Bresson \\"A man escaped\\", where the climax sequence was precisely to escape from prison thanks to a similar device.<br /><br />The documental is brilliantly portrayed. Not recommended for acrophobic.
0743270754|1.0|Well, after reading this book for forty-two days and making progress to the 37th page, I have quit. This is the most boring, stultifying text I have suffered through since college 4 decades ago. The author is undoubtedly a great researcher but she has difficulty converting that research into readable prose. My god she even quotes such trivial passages as \\"never again\\" or \\"he wanted to return to the US to die.\\" Why? Who knows. This book is just not worth the money I paid for it. While struggling through it, I managed to read four other books that pleasantly zipped along. \\"The Floor of Heaven\\" was fun, well-written, and well-documented. \\"Lost in Shangri-La\\" was also a good read. The two mysteries I read were great entertainment. Then I faced each day, my reading of Ms Goodwin's treatise (I forced myself, eventually, to read one page per day). Just don't spend the money or time on this book.<br /><br />My usual disclaimer: This is MY book report, not yours. If you do not like it, c'est la vie. I do not subscribe to reading follow-on comments, so anything you post will not be read by me.
0618918248|2.0|This book is a hit and miss. I say this because atheists will love it and theists will not. When I read a book I try to look at the information as objectively as possible. I will admit that it is often difficult to do so. This book is written very well. There is no doubt Dawkins is a very intelligent man. I only question his purpose for writting this book. None of the information he offers is new or ground breaking. They are the same old ideas presented by atheists for centuries. In most cases this book will not convince anyone. Most people will believe the same after reading this book as they did prior. I think there are better books available on this topic.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I wasn't fond of Haven to start with but then I finished the first episode and became hooked. Its a great show and when I saw it had been released on DVD I had to buy it.    The new season on the other hand has a ways to go before I can get into it. What is with shows that want to fix things that aren't broken? I mean its only its second season why must they change things or add things that aren't needed?    We'll see if this new season is as great as the first because thus far I am extremely disappointed.
B0050LJIRK|3.0|First off I am a big Limp Bizkit fan, and as a fan I expected that with the whole original lineup being back they would do much better. Now this album actually gets 2.5 stars, heres why. Guitarwise this album kicks ass, Bass was decent, drumming was generic, and vocals were ok. Fred Durst has lost his edge, he says the same stuff over and over. We know you don't give a F*** man, how many times do you have to say it on this album. I hear vocal struggles on this album, lyrics range from amazing to utter crap. The worst songs are Bring it Back, Douchebag, and Shark Attack. But... as always there are badass songs on here. They are Gold Cobra, Get a life, Walking Away, and Loser. The songs I didn't mention were pretty forgettable. Sorry Bizkit, nothing special.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|Judging by all comments below, there are many self-styled audiophile authorities, eager to tell you how things sound on stereo systems that are probably worth more than their cars, or show you .wav file outputs that demonstrate \\"the truth\\". All well-and-good, but the bottom line (which cannot be ignored) is this...how does it sound to YOU on your cd player-ipod-whatever-you-use? Either you like it or you don't. I agree Death Magnetic sounds (very) rough on the ears, but to insinuate that this Peace Sells remaster is in the same ball park is ridiculous. It sounds phenomenal to me, everything being crisp and clear without sacrificing any quality. I couldn't stand the \\"remixed\\" versions that came out in 2004 (Peace Sells in particular was butchered, resembling nothing like what my vinyl sounded like). Various hi-hat, guitar line and vocal sounds were gone (or added)...huh??? The wave-crack at the end of Devil's Island could barely be discerned, the snare drum in the title song was obliterated...YEESH! Thankfully, all is in order now and I can only hope Dave chooses to do the same for SFSGSW + RIP as well. The bonus concert from 1987 isn't exactly the greatest quality, but it's good enough considering it's something of a bootleg, and the energy of a band that's clearly \\"on their way\\" is apparent.
B000007UA4|5.0|This was her final cd before she changed labels.. May not be her best ever but it is a must for true fans and this cd is really the rarest of all her albums. Buy it Now!
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee is an inspiration.  What she endured is just unbelievable.  This book was a good and easy read.  From now on when anybody cries or whines to me about something insignificant going on in their life, I am going to tell them - \\"Really? Were you kidnapped at age 11 by a PYSCHO, raped repeatly while living in squalor and then did you give birth twice in a backyard to this PYSCHO's children?  No?  Then shut the !@#$ up!\\"
B003IPC5SO|5.0|This album was released digitally on my birthday last year (July 5th) it was the most amazing gift ever cause not only did it include my favorite B-side Go Hard Or Go Home but i got 3 video's from her amazing first trek of the US which I regretfully missed cause I had long given up on her touring here... Anyway I digress not only was this album fabulous but also brought forth Kylie's greatest tour she ever  went on which I got to witness front row in New York  of all places there is only 1 word I could use to describe this album and it's amazing every fan should own this!
0071762345|5.0|I had a pleasure to read \\"Likeable Social Media (...)\\" by Dave Kerpen. I don't know Dave but this book is absolutely MUST on everyone's list. Dave tried (successfully) explained how social media works...and he did a great work.    Step-by-step guide that's what it is. How to understand social media environment, and how to survive there.   Dave's book is one of those which I will read over and over again.
B003Y74KAW|4.0|This product has been wonderful! It fits my iPhone perfectly! I am very impressed with the cover, I wish I got it sooner! It has a great grip and has not fallen out of the case once. I recommend this product to anyone who has the Verizon iPhone 4.
B004EPYZPI|5.0|This was a great movie, one of the best I've seen in ages glad I took the chance on this blu ray. This movie is Proof that Matthew McConaughey can put on a great performance, hes great when booked in the right roles and I hope we see more of him like this in the future. Marisa Tomei still looking great and acting it as well, great movie all around.
0545123267|4.0|From the first few pages of this book, I knew I loved it. I've kept away from it for so long because it was about wolves, which I associated with Twilight and those wolves really turned me off. So, imagine my surprise when I finally picked up Shiver and found it was nothing like Twilight!    This is such a beautiful story and what I liked most about it was Grace. I found her to be truly authentic and while she describes herself to be somewhat plain, from Sam's view we find out she's anything but. Switching between both Grace and Sam's perspectives gave me a better view of the big picture and I felt like this gave more detail to a mostly straightforward story.    Maggie Stiefvater really nailed it when she created Sam and his pack. Unlike other shifter stories I can think of, Maggie perfectly transferred Sam's presence as a wolf into his human character and I loved him in both roles. Some of the moments between Grace and Sam as a wolf were some of the loveliest and saddest of the entire novel and by the end, I was desperately trying to find a way for Sam to be both!    I'm looking forward to Linger, the next in the series. I hope it's as good as this one!
B002NZK5TG|3.0|Best plant movie since Invation of the Body Snatchers.  Good PG entertainment with Steve Martin adding his own brand of comedy.  Enjoyable family entertainment and music.
B003B7OUL4|5.0|Really another great album by one of the greatest bands to almost make it big in the mainstream, but still become legendary worldwide outside the mainstream. There are even some more soulful vocals from Neil on this album. \\"10001110101\\" is by far my favorite song, and like always, the lyrics are super cool, and yet can make you both laugh and think all at once. My girlfriends favorite song is \\"Burning Beard\\"...so, there you have it.<br />Really great album you wont regret owning.
0767812387|3.0|Good story line.  Nick Nolte added a lot and Williams is a living fox on the dance floor.  Have seen this movie many times and trying to duplicate some of the latin moves.  Great workout!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|So much happened in this season. I swear that after so many episodes, I was wondering how the finale could actually top it. The HSQ (Holy S*** Quotient) was through the roof in every single episode!    Also, Castiel. He is amazing.    Now, this can count as a minor spoiler...maybe? Anyway, if you don't like spoilers, try to stop reading.    Anyway, first three seasons I was a Sam fangirl. I actually think I kinda hated him this season. He was given the idiot ball, and held onto it with all his might. I mean, he had his reasons, but still, after a point it just got ridiculous. I hope he's better next season, and wait to see. Dean became my favorite of the brothers, and it made me realize that I'm a sucker for Break the Cutie (Sam in seasons 1-3, and Dean here).     Anyway, amazing season, full of action and twists and turns. A great buy, and I'll never regret getting it.      (sorry about the over abundance of trope titles used; I've forgotten how to talk about/review works of fiction without using them...)
1594744769|5.0|Excellent read!  I was engrossed from the first page.  The book comes with sepia colored pictures and it doesn't feel like a child's book, as some may think. The characters are lovable and interesting. Well done, Ransom Riggs!  I would recommend this book for all age groups. Even mom would love this book. It's a bit fantasy/sci-fi. A fun read.
B000J5XS3C|3.0|This is a very functional small mixer, and you get what you pay for. It works as advertised. It's a simple, small utility mixer.    Here's the downside, pretty common issues to all Behringer products:  The construction is mostly plastic, including much of the chassis. Use a lot of TLC in transporting it.  The mic pre-amps suck - it doesn't take a lot for them to quickly get distorted.  The power supply connection is a silly DIN connector, does not positively lock, and VERY easily comes out. Even at this price, this is an inexcusable design flaw.  The 4 LED meter is pretty useless.    But like I said, for $60 it gets the job done (mostly).
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I loved this book and have recommended it to everyone I know.     Reading about what she went through is heartbreaking, but also shows what a strong person she really is.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|This movie turned me into a big Alfred Hitchcock fan!  I went into the film wanting to see the classic shower scene, and I left with a fond appreciation for film.  More than just a horror movie, Psycho was a groundbreaking film that continues to influence the film industry to this day.  Aside from the subject matter, the texture and tone of the film is both unsettling and beautiful to behold.  Hitchcock could manipulate the lens in such a way as to keep you glued to your seat and leave you spellbound!  Forget the remake with Anne Heche. there is nothing like the original!  A landmark film, and one of my favorites!
B002ZG976U|5.0|I am not a huge Cher fan, but I love Christina.  She has an amazing and powerful voice that compares to no one of her time.  I love musical type movies but this is the best one I have seen in a long time.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|I was so scared to watch this when I was a kid.  It's not a very bloody film, but the atmosphere and that feeling of isolation seeps into your mind as you watch it.  Jack Nicholson is one of my favorite actors, and he does not disappoint in this film.  He plays a struggling writer over looking a hotel with his wife and son for the winter.  From there he begins a descent into madness or was he already mad to begin with?  This are the questions you will struggle with as you watch.  Stanley Kubrick creates a beautiful looking film which takes on greater meaning with repeat viewings.  The last time I watched the film I focused on the colors used in the film, especially the use of the color red.  Kubrick is a master of film making, and with this film he was able to prove that horror could be just as artful as other films.  The Shining is a classic and should not be missed!
0738711500|4.0|These were easy for my 13 year old to learn for \\"Divination class\\" at our Harry Potter party.  Lots of fun.
B004WKOCP8|5.0|I love this album, it's abosultely beautiful.  Billboard seekers should probably keep it moving, as only true Incubus fans are going to really appreciate this masterpiece.  SCIENCE was like 20 years ago.. get over it. Appreciate the music they have made in the past, but the present is also wonderful, and I look forward to the future. Incubus is the most underrated band of all time.  Thank you Incubus.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|tried playing this game and didn't really get it. maybe I needed to give it more time. but I was annoyed that I continued to get prompt after prompt to update. I did 8 total and it still wanted me to do more updates. more annoying, none of them worked. uninstalled.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|I highly recommend this show!  Won't disappoint!! Great story line to keep you hooked and awesome humor that will keep you laughing all the way through!!  :)
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I thought the subject matter was interesting when reading the reviews. Amnesia; One of those mysterious afflictions. About two thirds of the way through, I was hoping that something different was going to happen, as it started to seem redundant with the unknown mornings, and journal writing. Well, it definitely happened. Kept me home reading instead of going on a family outing.   I've read quite a few books this summer, and this one tops the charts.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I just finished book 3 and I don't know how I feel about it.  I will say I am a bit disappointed.  Books 1 and 2 were so incredible!  But I think it was due to all the action from the hunger games.  There is some action in book 3 but it doesn't provide that adrenaline pump that the other 2 had.  Our main character, Katniss, just feels so lost throughout most of the book, you feel so sorry for her!  How much does one character have to go through?! I didn't like what happened to Peeta either but I guess it shows what war really does to people.  I don't really think you can recover from such atrocities.  I was happy with the ending and who Katniss ended up with...he was the perfect choice!  I probably need to re read Mockinjay a little slower this time.  I found myself a little bored in some parts and read through some parts too quickly hoping for the pace to pick up.  But for me it really didn't.  Do I regret reading this series?  No way!!  It will probably always be on my top series ever...it was worth it!!  I highly recommend it to everyone!
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|They just don't make TV like this anymore.  One of another many bitter-sweet ventures of television artistry.    Wonderful cast of actors.  Great stories, direction and cinematography.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|If you happen to be in an upbeat mood and want to stay that way, you might consider skipping this one.  While the storyline and acting are pretty much unbeatable, there are deep moral underpinnings and scenes of recurrent sadness--many of which involve young children. I'm now going to add a mild spoiler alert so you may not want to read further.  Namely, the opening scene unecessarily \\"telegraphs\\" the ending, and thereby tamps down the overall suspense level.  This scene could have easily been omitted without compromising the integrity of the film.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|After searching through local stores in my area, I discovered that a lot of the Disney Classics are hard to come by. Most stores carry the same 2 or 3 movies, and their pricing is ridiculous. I was pleased to find this copy of Beauty and the Beast at such a reasonable price. I received the movie well before the expected shipping date that was indicated, and the package and product were in excellent, still-wrapped condition. I would highly recommend this seller. A+++
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Note - this a review of the product, not of the the movie.  Sucker Punch is an amazing movie and I have been eagerly awaiting the extended version.    What the package reeds \\"Blue-ray, DVD, Digital copy\\"  The product features list include :  Extended Cut Feature Film  Theatrical Cut Feature Film    What they do not tell you is that the extended version is only on the Blu-ray disc. The DVD is the theatrical release only. If you do no own a Blu-ray player you can not watch the extended version.
B004V7XWEE|5.0|I was surprised that this purchase was more than I expected. It is a great purchase and I enjoy it. If you are a fan of Marvin Gaye, you will like this CD/Vinyl.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|i do not have a vocabulary that allows me to express the fascination and joy that this album brings.  it's actual music - not the overproduced and auto tuned style that seems to have inundated the music world.  this album is true heartfelt music, with thought and care put into the producing.  her lyrics will evoke the emotions of even the most cynical.  five stars are available so i give them all.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|Is a dish serverd best cold. This woman serves it frozen and her recipients don't have anyway of thawing it out. What goes around comes around.
0307592839|1.0|This book was disappointing from the first chapter on. Each time I got involved in a character, the chapter ended and there was never a satisfying conclusion to their story. There would be a mention in another chapter later on, but way too many loose ends. And overall, most of the characters ended up one dimensional---privileged people in existential crises with no serious effort to change. Maybe in my old age I'm getting lazy or boring, but I have enough people with problems in real life, I don't need all my books to be about unhappy, disenchanted, unappealing people.
B0053F042G|4.0|This was a very good movie and worth renting. It's not that long of a movie (only 93 minutes) but the story kept moving along and it wasn't drawn out which I like for the most part. If you like sci-fi type movies then check this one out.
B004Y1USV2|1.0|This isn't a Yes album! There is no Yes without Jon Anderson it's a simple as that! The rest of the members of the band that are here that worked with Anderson should be ashamed of themselves for putting out this garbage under the guise of Yes. Call it a Buggles album if you like but don't call it a Yes album as that insults us long time fans!

030745455X|4.0|\\"The girl who played with fire\\" is the second in a trilogy by Steig Larsson.  The first was \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" and the third was \\"The Girl Who Stirred the Hornets Nest.\\" I highly recommend this series to those who love action mysteries.  Sadly, Steig died shortly after fininshing the trilogy.  We lost one of this eras best writers.
B003Y5H556|4.0|There are 2 things that will put off the average viewer from this film as soon as it starts. If you can't get past them you'll likely hate it.  1) The non-accents. People automatically assume that any period piece must run with an English accent. But if you want to be more accurate, they should've had a German accent since the tale was originally set in Germany. This is not a period piece since it is a fairy tale. Possibly a consideration for it's target audience.    2) The relatively modern dialogue they used. Likely because this was meant for Teens, going archaic will probably be lost on them.    To be fair these 2 issues did bother me at first viewing. But since I also watched the Alternate version and the comments version, I did get past those 2 issues and I found the film more enjoyable and satisfying.    The thing that really bugged me though is the crossbow man with the crusader helm. It's just wrong to combine those 2 things. Also Father Auguste was just too odd.    This is clearly not a big budget spectacular. Not too many overbearing characters. But it held my attention thanks to some of the leads.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|While troubling, Jaycee's story is so inspiring. Despite being kidnapped at age 11, raped, and held captive against her will for 18 years, Jaycee's spirit remained positive.    This book recounts her experience as well as her re-integration, along with that of her daughters, back into society.    This is a great book, although it is troubling to read some of its content. Certainly not a book I would recommend for younger readers.
0061914177|4.0|Holy crap this is a popular book. Here are two big reasons why...<br /><br />1. Gary is a huge fan of Facebook and Twitter, two very overhyped tools that are used more for public masturbation (figuratively speaking... mostly) than for actual self-promotion.<br /><br />2. Gary believes that social media generates money, a hypothesis widely known but rarely, and I mean RARELY, proven with objective evidence.<br /><br />You'd think after reading this far that I'm a hater. Well, yes and no. I think Facebook sucks and I hate it and I shake my head in disbelief when I hear, multiple times daily, how badly people screw themselves with it. I do, of course, reserve the right to change my mind, and may do so if I ever manage to find a way to make it work for me.<br /><br />Am I a Gary hater? Hell no. The man is smarter and ballsier than 99.9% of the world's population, and he knows how to make it work for him. Here's what I got from this book, which is why it got four stars and why I will keep it and definitely read it again:<br /><br />You need to know what you want and go for it. Full speed. There is no break from living your dream, you either do it or you don't.<br /><br />You need to know your voice and speak in it. Don't try to be someone you're not so you can get more customers or have more \\"conversations.\\" Screw that - you're better off losing 20% of your audience than constantly trying to keep up with someone you're trying to be, but you know you're not. The hit you take to your quality of life is not worth it, period.<br /><br />When you figure out what you want, make a list of 50 things to say about it. And don't make them things about yourself or your product. In other words, don't preen and act like anyone cares. People will only start caring when you ask questions they want to answer and give answers to questions they actually have.

B0042J6VUS|1.0|Awesome shipping time.  Ordered on 7/15, arrived 7/18!!!  Yet it took less time to break. This thing is very flimsy and poorly designed and constructed. It reminds me of the products we used get from the \\"5and10\\" stores when I was a kid.  In fact the product is built like a toy, not something you would mount an expensive camera or cellphone unto. I should have been more discerning with my shopping.
B004LWZW24|1.0|I was invited to watch this movie by a friend of mine with the promise of being scared to death. I sat through most of the movie bored and wishing for the end. If you enjoy seeing random bloody hand prints, greyscale ghost children and children's toys moving or their own, well this movie is for you! They show maybe two or three ghosts during the entire movie, the plot is poor and I have seen better acting as well.  I've read so many reviews on here of people raving about how scary this movie was, although that is subjective, it does make you wonder what world these people are living in.
0385737955|5.0|I loved this book.  It was easy to get in to.  It was easy to be entertained.  I like the connection between characters.  No cussing.  No sexuality.  It was clean, good reading.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I saw the first part [[ASIN:B001UV4XHY Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1]] and I thought that one was fantastic. That one was fantastic and the last one is even better! I thought that the last one was phenomenal! There are some changes from the book, but even with those, the movie is still phenomenal! The movie still follows the book very closely and they included so many of the important scenes from it. I can't wait to get this one when it comes out on DVD!
0385738757|5.0|I liked this one even more.  It had love.  It had betrayel.  It had so many emotions.  I can't wait to see how it all ends.  I also hope they ultimately end up together again!!!
0062060554|4.0|I liked the story, and I won't repeat the synopsis here as so many before me have said it well.  The book was a page turner for me, and it went everywhere with me until it finished it.    However,  I found 4 continuity errors which bothered me.  I found myself stressed/anxious and wanting to yell at the character to go back and pick up the journal that she dropped in the previous paragraph.    I didn't care for the ending, I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it.  On the fun side, I keep trying to decide how to cast the characters.  My overall favorite actress for Christine is Sandra Bullock, but I don't think she looks old enough for the older Christine.  Debra Winger?  Cybil Shepherd? Or Jamie Lee Curtis?  The Ben character:  Brad Pitt or George Clooney.
031606792X|5.0|I loved the way she pulled it all together.  I love her humor between Jacob and Rosalie.  I love that she chose to keep her baby.  I liked this book better than number 2.  I understand why Bella chose the name Renesme, but I still don't prefer the name.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Great app. Setting up the app took a few minutes and I was getting frustrated that I couldn't create a folder on my home screen.  I didn't understand the widget aspect. once you add a widget to your screen all the apps that you selected into the catagory show up in a scrollable box. I have a ton of kids games that I wanted to be able to place in a folder for my 3 year old.  I hope now he can open the one folder and choose a game to play instead of looking through the entire app list.
B003Y38YFS|5.0|These are adorable shoes.  They weigh nothing and feel as close to barefoot as a shoe gets.  I usually don't like thong shoes because they don't stay on.  The straps keep these shoes on solidly.  If you order the right size the toe strap should not be irritating after the first day or so.  My first day wearing these shoes I walked around the zoo with my family.  They felt great!  Water doesn't hurt them and they clean up easily.  The straps are on the narrow side but loosen up a bit after some wearing.  Might need to order a size up if you have wider feet.  Good simple everyday shoe for warmer weather.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|I love Incubus so much but this album was such a disappointment. I love all their albums but I just can't get into this one. I enjoyed the first single but the other songs aren't as good. I was really looking forward to this album too which sucks.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I normally don't review apps that i get on app of the day but I see myself using this one a lot so might as well. I have a lot of apps and this allows me to categorize them and put folders on the main homescreen. I'm pretty sure it does a lot more and ill find out soon enough.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Excellent way to organize widgets on your homescreen. Select desired Apps o a preset label and marvel at the space saving, clean looking and downright intuitive scrollable widget on you homescreen. The takes a little trial and error to get things he way you like but the payoff is great.   I am happy to have this on my nook color and Htc Thunderbolt!  Don't miss out!
B000002TYX|5.0|If you love the Beatles and want to listen to some of their lesser-known tunes, this is the album for you.  It starts with my favorite, \\"Free as a Bird\\".  You will hear speeches by John Lennon, Brian Epstein, and Paul McCartney.  Did you know that they recorded \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" and \\"The Sheik of Araby\\"?  This album is full of surprises.  I would have liked to have known all the song titles before ordering this album, but surprises can be a lot of fun.  This is a 2-disc album with 60 tunes for your enjoyment.  I highly recommend this one.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is the best app. It is essential to anyone who wants to be organised with their apps. I bought it over a year ago and it has never given me any trouble.  Rooted Eris
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have been using the free version of this app for about 5 months.  In that time, FolderOrganizer has become one of those apps that I must have.  I love keeping all my homescreens clean and organized, and this app is essential to that.  With over 200 apps installed on my D2, FolderOrganizer allows me to have one touch access to any of those 200 apps in only two touches and no scrolling.  Sure, you can just open your app drawer and scroll through all the apps.  But this makes it so much easier by organizing all your apps (games, book readers, dev tools, market apps, maps/gps apps, etc.) into folders and having them available right on your homescreens.  I'm very excited to now have access to the paid version options!
B004XJHBCE|4.0|One of the best folder and organizing app out there. A lot of options to choose from. Wish the font size of the created folder, was also customizable.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I play this game regularly on the subway (on my Evo) and it seems to make my commute go by faster. From what I can tell, the game is missing puzzle mode and Zen garden, but for the asking price I can't complain. For those of you losing your game progress when there is an incoming call, I suggest playing the game in airplane mode.  Plants vs. Zombies is a must have game for your Android device. @NYCMediaMix
B0001ARCFA|5.0|AKG K240's Awsome! I am very happy,they give a rich natural sound reproduction.It seems like the sound is all around you not just in each ear these are studio quality, I wore the first version a similar pair back in the 80's for<br />ON AIR work, these sound better than back then.<br />These Cans Feel very comfortable and for extended use aswell they are light on your ears and seem to breath my ears don't sweat when I wear them.I couldn't be more happy you will be too.
B004WKOCP8|2.0|Sometimes when you listen to a band you want them to bite your head off.  Other times you just want to feel chewed on a bit, but in most cases you want your band to have some teeth.  It pains me to say this because I love me some Incubus, but this album is toothless and I feel as if I've just been gummed into a monotonous musical abyss by my favorite band.  This album is the equivalent of eating plain yogurt, no flavors, fruit or granola.  Some people enjoy that, but I've always considered Incubus to be a band more akin to having the smoothness and tang of yogurt, but with all the fixings that makes listening to them a more exciting sensory experience.      I will say that I appreciate a band that takes risks, and is constantly challenging themselves and trying new sounds.  For that I commend them on this album, because it is a different \\"version\\" of Incubus than we've heard in the past.  But not all new directions are good directions, and some risks simply don't pan out (hence why they're called 'risks).  This album is a good example of that.  Part of me wants to say that even a bad Incubus album is better than something other than Incubus, but I kind of doubt that after the newness of this album wears off I'll ever listen to it.  As it is I've had it in my CD player for a week, and haven't really developed any more appreciation for it than I had on my initial disappointing listen.     It isn't that this album is mellow.  I'm not one of those fans harping about \\"the old days\\" of Incubus yore.  I actually prefer some of their mellower songs like \\"Are you In?\\" \\"Oil and Water\\" \\"Drive\\" and even most of the Crow Left of the Murder album.  But this album is just lacking that vibe and flare that Incubus is known for.  You can still have 'teeth' and sing mellow music as they've demonstrated in the past, and are completely capable of today.    The lyrics are good, and Brandon's voice is great as usual, but there doesn't seem to be as much musical depth to the songs as in the past.  To be fair this album seems to be influenced by a lot of different sounds including Kings of Leon (Theives could easily be on one of their albums), and some 70's era Elton John style ballads.  But the title track sounds like it's from a Disney film.  It reminded me of something that could've been in Aladdin or Hercules, not because it was bad, but because the music was that simplistic.  What bugs me about this album the most is it's uninspired and forgettable.  This is yet another example of a great, creative, and unique band putting out average music that could be done by any band.    What I would really like to see Incubus try sometime is to go back to the mindset that lead to the Morning View album, where they essentially went someplace and just vibed out for awhile.  I'd love to hear them put together an album that has more Asian sounds similar to the last song on Morning View, \\"Aqueous Transmissions.\\"  I think that would've made a much better \\"mellow\\" Incubus album if they had at least tried to infuse some sort of unique sound into their songs instead of just resting comfortably on repetitive everyday sounds and beats. There are glimmers of brilliance on this album that I think could lead to some decent sounds later on, and as much as I'd like to rate this album higher...the truth is when I asked myself \\"would I like them to make another album like this one?\\"  The answer was, absolutely not, and if they did they'd no longer be my favorite band.  So the best I can do is pass this one off as a misstep that may appeal to some, but will probably go down as one of their worst albums, and wait for the next album (which I hope comes sooner than usual).
B0052UYJDC|5.0|This is a FANTASTIC compilation of articles. The one at the end is particularly useful being# 59 of 60 (60 great articles equal a wonderful full size book btw). It is entitled 100 ways to simplify your life and make yourself happier).    It functions as a marvelous little to do list. A starter set of things to consider when embracing minimalism.    I like this little kindle book (99 cents!) even better than her book \\"the Joy of Less\\" which is also an excellent addition to my Kindle but this 99 cent version is sharper, clearer, more distilled. Dare I say \\"more minimalist?\\"      Like any good book, I don't agree with everything 100% but even a disagreement that causes a person to think thru what they DO believe is a great point. I appreciate how she makes me take a second look at my beliefs.    Great book, I'd buy it even if it was $20.
0316789720|5.0|I love this book. I remember having this book when I was a kid and when I saw it on Amazon I had to have it. It shows you step by step how to draw several different things. It's easy to follow and fun. I had a blast learning to draw these things when I was a kid. Some of them are still stuck in my head today. Great buy. I would absolutely recommend it, for children and adults alike.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|This is a great show, or was.  James Woods is a phenomenal actor and why the executives would cancel this show is beyond me.  I just finished Season 1 and am going to pay Amazon to see all the episodes of Season 2.  The executives need to get off their boozing or whatever their problem is and keep the really great and good shows on and cancel the dimwit ones (which shall remain nameless as anyone with any intelligence knows which ones I mean).  Sorely disappointed this was canceled.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|for me would be, \\"How I sold over 1 million ebooks myself, because I read John Locke's ebook!\\". I did read John's book, and I must continue writing to be able to publish my own first book myself first. John Locke's book did inspire to me enough to put into action a publication deisre that has burned slowly inside me for over 40 years now into a reality. His book was not only a step by step \\"how to\\" guide. His style is combined with an internal, \\"c'mon kid, you can too\\" firestarter. The guide also blends common sense wisdom, with personally earned success principles of life lived by John himself that transitions success into a path that when you are willing to follow, can lead you places few get to go and see. You must pay the price, for the price to be paid to you. Thanks for writing a book that once I began reading, I could put down until I was finished with the whole book. Dr. Mike
0553381695|2.0|I approached \\"A Clash of Kings\\" reluctantly. Another thousand-page fantasy novel was not something I looked forward to adding in my life, but my admiration for the previous installment was so great that I overcame my reluctance and dived in.<br /><br />The results? Meh.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Game of Thrones\\", \\"Clash of Kings\\" lacks imaginative characters. The plot picks up where GOT ends, with the principal characters fighting among themselves for the spoils of Robert Baratheon's kingdom. Unlike GOT, however, Martin introduces few memorable characters, instead parading a seemingly endless troop of minor princes, dukes, and lords before the reader's ever-wearying eyes. One gets the impression that Martin, tired from his imaginative feats in GOT, simply wished for a respite, and allowed plotlines to meander in somewhat predictable ways in COK.<br /><br />The momentous events which close the preceding volume become staid fixtures in the new one, including Daenerys' dragons, the capture of Jaime Lannister, the ascendance of Tyrion, and the deaths of Ned Stark and Khal Drogo. These plotlines quickly lose momentum in COK due to over-familiarity and predictable developments.<br /><br />COK reminds one of the Robert Jordan series, \\"Wheel of Time\\" for its endless detail and over-wrought cast of characters-- an unfortunate development for what had been a promising saga.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />J.J. Abrams' \\"Super 8\\" hearkens back to the days of early Steven Spielberg (who co-produced the film) - a time when summer blockbusters could appeal as much to the heart as to the eye, when a group of intrepid suburban kids could unravel mysteries and take on evil forces, when the military-industrial complex was clearly up to no good, and when tear-stained characters could look in wide-eyed, tight-shot amazement at wonders unraveling above them in the heavens.<br /><br />Set, appropriately, in 1979 - in a time before digital cameras and CGI technology, when children had to express their creativity and imagination with what was then the technological equivalent of chewing gum and baling wire - \\"Super 8\\" centers on a group of nerdish preteens who are attempting to make their own amateur zombie-splatter film for an upcoming contest. While filming one night, the kids are witness to a horrifying freight train crash, the repercussions of which go far beyond just the mass of mangled, twisted metal strewn across the area. For it seems the Air Force has taken a more than casual interest in the event, and soon strange and inexplicable occurrences begin happening in town.<br /><br />The focal point of the story is Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney), a young boy whose mother has just been killed in a tragic factory accident, and whose grieving father (Kyle Chandler from TV's incomparable \\"Friday Night Lights\\") serves as the town's deputy. Joe also has a crush on the pretty and alluring Alice Dainard (Elle Fanning), who has been brought into the boys' film project at the last moment.<br /><br />The similarities between \\"Super 8\\" and any number of Spielberg - or at least Spielbergian - films (most notably, of course, \\"E.T.\\") are both so numerous and so obvious that they really don't bear repeating here. Yet, while I admire much of what Abrams is trying to do in this movie, so much of it falls flat that I really can't recommend it in the final analysis. What's actually missing is that special Spielberg touch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like \\"E.T.\\" into a timeless classic. One never questions Spielberg's belief in his material, but I'm not sure one can quite make the same claim about Abrams, at least not in this particular instance. Abrams' story lacks the streamlined clarity of an \\"E.T.\\" and, by extension, the emotional resonance that comes along with it. \\"Super 8\\" seems to be going off in so many different directions at once that it winds up going nowhere. And, frankly, the sci-fi aspects of the story feel awfully stale at this late stage in the game.<br /><br />In addition to \\"E.T.,\\" there are bits and pieces of \\"The Goonies,\\" \\"Stand By Me,\\" \\"Gremlins,\\" and \\"War of the Worlds\\" in the film as well. And that, in the final analysis, is what's most wrong with \\"Super 8.\\" It's made up of so many borrowed parts that, in the end, it's left with nothing it can truly call its own.uch, that almost Quixotic visionary conviction that could turn even a simple work like \\"E.T.\\" into a timeless classic.

B004WKOCP8|3.0|They may be using their \\"classic\\" logo -- the one associated with alt-rock/nu-era favorites such as \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E.\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" -- in conjunction with their seventh album, \\"If Not Now, When?\\" but don't expect much of a return to form for Incubus. With nearly half a decade gone by since the release of their last studio album, \\"Light Grenades,\\" there's a noticeable evolution in sound, for better or worse.<br /><br />While Incubus have always strived to re-invent themselves with the release of each album, the shift in sound and style on \\"If Not Now, When?\\" may be just a bit too jarring for even the most hardcore of hardcore fans. Gone are the noodlings of guitarist Mike Einziger (which were at the forefront of the band's previously most polarizing \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\") and the emotive and often empowering words of frontman Brandon Boyd. What has emerged and what defines Incubus circa 2011 is, for lack of a better term, a blend of adult contemporary and alt-rock. Quite frankly, it's a surprisingly middle-of-the-road sound for a band who has, time and time again, proven themselves capable of tackling several genres in a unique and creative fashion.<br /><br />On one hand, it's refreshing to hear a mainstream band refusing to cater to one particular demographic while pushing themselves in different directions, but unfortunately the creativity and unique compositions that had previously defined the group are all but vanished, save for a few savory numbers such as \\"Adolescents\\" and \\"In The Company of Wolves,\\" which are hardly vintage Incubus but bright spots nevertheless. What really rubs the salt in the wound though is the performance by Boyd, whose delivery on the likes of \\"Promises, Promises\\" and \\"Isadore\\" will likely irritate the average listener's gag reflex, unless, of course, you're a twenty-something female who imagines herself being seduced by the band. Boyd's voice still sounds just as good as ever, but his lyrics hit an all-time low and drag down the potential of quite a few decent tracks.<br /><br />It'd be unfair to outright call this a bad album. A more appropriate adjective to assign to the experience of listening to \\"If Not Now, When?\\" would be \\"underwhelming.\\" While there's a handful of standouts (mostly at the tail-end of the record) the album is mostly cluttered with forgettable throwaways that sound like outtakes from \\"Light Grenades\\" and \\"A Crow Left of the Murder\\" that deserved to be left on the cutting room floor. It's hard not to judge this body of work without considering the gems that precede it, but it's blatantly obvious that \\"If Not Now, When?\\" is a failed experiment of sorts and in no way, shape or form lives up to the legacy of the band that created it. All we can do now is sit and wait, hoping the band will come back sooner than later with something that washes the bad taste of this album out of our mouths.

If you're seeking plot advancement, this book is like watching grass grow...on Quaaludes.  It seems to me that Martin started off this series strong, but lost control over his storyline over the past two installments.  Things have gotten a little too complex to move the story forward smoothly.  And given the pace at which Martin writes, it's a gamble as to whether or not I'll live long enough to see him finish this series off (I'm 55 - really just jabbing here at the years between book releases).  I hope Martin regains the magic in the next book.<br /><br />2 stars...zzzzzzzzzzzzz.

1439102724|4.0|From scanning many of the reviews it is plain to see the reviews reflect readers' politics! I'm certainly not surprised. I am always a little put off when reviews spoil the book and offer plot spoilers, which was the case here.<br /><br />I read JP books knowing that I'm getting some interesting cut from the headlines story and I'm fine with that. At tines some of the characters are flat and other times they are not. This book was amazing. I enjoyed her use of different voices with the chapters as a storytelling device. I enjoyed this book and, yes, it was about such personal and political issues. The book is sure to anger or frustrate some.
0743298020|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is a debut novel by Diane Setterfield that pays respect to predecessor gothic novels like Jane Eyre and Rebecca.  Contrary to some misleading descriptions, this book is not a true ghost story.  Metaphors people!  After a lifetime of lies and mysteries, a famous author named Vida Winter tells her \\"true\\" life story to Margaret, a random bookstore owner's daughter.  The book is interspersed with some present day sections following Margaret's own less interesting story.  Vida Winter's tale, on the other hand, contains oh so dysfunctional family members, sociopathic twins, ghostly mysteries, warped love, suspicious deaths and surprising twists.  What more can you ask for?<br /><br />While I am a notorious skimmer and flip-to-the-end spoiler-lover, I actually didn't spoil the ending and just enjoyed reading as the story and mysteries unraveled.  Savor some well written moments as Setterfield manages to capture various small emotions perfectly with words.  I think Setterfield does a great job of capturing moments and feelings (like the anxiety of nearing the end of a good book) but sometimes overdoes it a bit (especially if you're listening to the audiobook).  The pace was pretty good for the most part, but there were a few lags, especially with Margaret's modern timeline.  I also think that Setterfield did a great job of setting up some of these great and strange characters, but then kinda fell short with them later on as they slowly shuffled away.<br /><br />This would be a great book club pick because there are so many different interpretations and unanswered questions.  And of course this book appealed to the booklover in me.  Book lovers will enjoy immersing themselves in the world of boutique bookstores and dilapidated mansions and will appreciate the nods to classic literary pieces.  I wish Setterfield wrote more books since I think this is a great debut novel with plenty of room to grow and develop.  More modern gothic novels please!
B001LNOOG6|5.0|...The book had me dying to hear (I listened to the audiobook version) the next move Danny Cartwright would make. Stephen Craig in all his arrogance and self-importance was a brilliantly written antagonist; his character is shrewd and did not bore me to tears with the foolish antics many opponents have. The plot was neither predictable nor slow and kept me on the edge of my seat until the very last word...\\"Guilty\\".
B00005B36H|5.0|I have a respect for Tool that I'll probably never be able to verbally explain to anyone. All I can say is that they are masters of their instruments, and write incredible songs with emotionally/spiritually driven lyrics.

0545259088|5.0|***May contain spoilers***<br /><br />For the last few years Sam and Grace have occupied a large part of my heart, they are most definitely one of my most favourite YA couples and I have always rooted for their happy ending, however I must admit that when I first started reading this book and saw that they did not play as large of a role in it than they had in the previous books I wasn't as heartbroken as I had thought I would be. Why would that be? Because of Cole. While in the previous book he was totally swoon-worthy with his bad-boy behavior he was even more so swoon-worthy in this book because he showed a completely different side of himself- a gentle, caring, and selfless side- while still maintaining his trademark sarcastic edge.<br /><br />In the parts that Sam and Grace were the focus of the story you couldn't help but experience the emotional turmoil that they were feeling alongside them. From Grace transforming back to a human and trying to remember who she was- let alone remembering who Sam was, Sam frantically trying to find the now-human Grace before the cold took her away from him once again,and the realization that no one was safe with Jack Culpeper in town.<br /><br />What I also loved also appreciated about this book was how humorous it was, when you were in the pits about the Grace and Sam situation, someone would come along (usually Cole) and do something to really uplift your mood- for instance, all of the voicemails that Cole left on Isabel's answering machine, Sam and Cole bonding as Cole tried to teach himself how to play guitar, Isabel and Cole dancing around the kitchen, and Grace bugging Sam when he was in the shower.<br /><br />I think that my largest complaint about this book was the ending. I am the sort of person who needs an epilogue that spells everything out for me (for instance in the epilogue of \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" we find out which characters married one another, their occupations as adults, their children's names, etc.), I hate things that are left up in the air, and therefore not knowing what truly happens to the characters, specifically Grace, eats me up inside (especially when taking into consideration that THIS IS THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES! *Fingers crossed that Maggie extends the series a la Cassie Clare and her \\"Mortal Instruments\\" series, or that she writes a spin-off a la Richelle Mead with her \\"Vampire Academy\\" and \\"Bloodlines\\" series).<br /><br />All in all, aside from the little problem I have with the ending of the book, I think that this is a perfectly written finale to such an amazingly emotional series.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have used this app for almost a year now and I love it. I rarely have to open my app drawer at all. all of my apps right there on my home screen, neatly organized just like I like them. i highly recommend this app. I paid for the full version so get it for free while you can.
0810997827|2.0|After reading a chapter of the first book, I think its great for 3th or 4th graders to read but no younger than that because of the context of words used. I had stopped my kid (1st grader) from reading them till later. Still a good sets of books for more matured kids to read and have. Thanks!
1451629184|5.0|I have not yet finished this book, so it might not be appropriate to write a full review, but I have things I want to say already.<br />This woman is a survivor, an incredible person.<br />I was afraid to read Jaycee's book, to hear the real story of so much horror. I bought it mainly to support her effort to regain her life,to tell her story in her own words.  But I opened it, and began reading, and I am glad I did.<br />What an amazing little girl she was, and what a memoir of her survival.<br />I am about halfway through the book, and I reccommend it.<br />This is a fascinating woman with a story that as horrifying as it is, will still uplift you.<br />Thank You Jaycee, for having to courage to share your story.  Thank You for writing this book.
B004Y1USJE|4.0|I have every Yes album from Yes to this one. I am a huge fan. I have seen virtually all line-ups live. As a huge Jon Anderson fan, I admit, I was pre-disposed to hate this album. I was holding out hope because White, Howe and Squire are always great together. I'm a Geoff Downes fan too. My real concern was the singer and the songs themselves. It feels like Squire had to get Anderson out of the way in order to blow the dust off this 30 year old Trevor Horn song.<br /><br />The live version from \\"The Word is Live\\" was poorly recorded but always sounded like an intersting song. Did this interesting song deserve 6 tracks on this CD?<br /><br />The vocals are good. The new singer has been able to sound like Anderson at times, but on this album he sounds more like Trevor Horn.  The harmony of Trevor, Benoit, and Squire really sounds good.<br /><br />As good as it is, Jon Anderson's writing and spirit are missed for sure.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Buy it to complete your collection as I did. I think any fan of Yes will enjoy these well written and well produced songs.<br /><br />While you are buying stuff get the \\"Union Live\\" CD for some real Yes magic or pick up Jon's new CD \\"Surival and Other Stories\\" if you like Jon you'll love it.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I have used the lite version of this app for quite a while a recently purchased the full version to access some advanced sorting features (Yes, despite Amazon's erroneous description, this app has been available for quite some time in both the Amazon Appstore and Android Market). While many of the more basic features of this app are built into the newer versions of Android and some of the more popular alternative launchers, the more advanced sorting and organization features make this app invaluable to anyone who wants to declutter or organize their homescreens. Exploring the options for folder widgets reveals that you can display many apps with smaller icons, make scrolling widgets (with launchers that support scrolling), theme folder widgets, and probably more that I haven't figured out yet.    App permissions on Amazon are always thought to be suspicious, but it would be impossible for this app to create shortcuts to contacts or bookmarks without being able to access them, and it would be impossible to use the contact shortcuts to call anyone without being able to access phone calls. The functions of the app detailed in the description are all made possible by accessing specific permissions...
0525423273|4.0|I received this book in February with the intention of reading it right away. I had heard nothing but phenomenal things about it, but unfortunately, it languished on my shelf.  After much prodding from Jennie, I pulled the book off the shelf and proceeded to devour it.  When I finally finished it and closed the covers, I wanted to hug this book. That was how much I truly and immensely enjoyed it.<br /><br />Anna is such a fabulous character. I loved how normal she was, despite being thrust into a situation that she didn't want to be in. Anna is spunky, funny, flawed, fallible, and utterly perfect. She was so real that I felt like I was reading about someone I knew. I adored her world, her friends, her handling of complicated situations. I loved Anna.<br /><br />And then there was Etienne St. Clair. Oh, Etienne. How could Anna not fall for this amazing, beautiful boy? He was such a contrasting character to the other teenage boys in the novel and in other Young Adult novels. Etienne is every bit as remarkable as Anna. He, too, is thrust into a very complex situation having to do with his family dynamic. His family relationships, particularly with his father, were already rocky. But when life springs the unexpected on Etienne, I wanted to put my arms around him and tell him it would be OK. Etienne is such an honest and genuine character. Much like with Anna, I was able to tap into his emotions and feel what he was feeling.<br /><br />The plot can sound like it is a sappy teenage love story. And it is a teenage love story, but it is not at all sappy, and it is so much more than a love story. Stephanie Perkins deftly created not only amazing and loveable characters, but a beautiful story of coming of age, love, and playing the hand fate deals us. She set this wonderful story against the backdrop of Paris, and I don't think anything could have been more perfect. When I wasn't busy falling in love with the characters and their terrific quirks, I was mesmerized by the descriptions of the city. I think if this story had been set anywhere else, this novel would not have had half the impact on me that it did.<br /><br />Every detail about this novel was superb. Perkins totally hit it out of the park with this novel. I cannot wait to read her next work, Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this novel 100%!hink if this story had been set anywhere else, this novel would not have had half the impact on me that it did.

B0050BEM1M|4.0|I'm kind of new into the whole Mike Leigh film-fan thing.  I've seen a few of his films, but I actually really need to get into his 90's work, which is where a lot of my friends say his real gems are.  That being said, I really do like what I've seen so far.  Even films that initially didn't strike me (like `Happy-Go-Lucky') have intrigued me all the more as time as passed; and there really is no denying that `Vera Drake' is a modern masterpiece.<br /><br />So that brings me to `Another Year', a film that seemed rather dull and bland to me (from an outsider's point of view) that wound up being anything but.<br /><br />The film revolves around an aged couple, Tom and Gerri, who live in England.  They have an eclectic group of friends, namely the middle-aged Mary.  Mary is desperate for attention, in and out of bad relationships and determined to find Mr. Right, but Mr. Right is elusive and her personality (possessive, clingy, frantic, pathetic) is a deterrent, especially when her obsession with age and feeling or appearing younger than the lines on her face would suggest cause her to seek out the affections of inappropriate suitors, namely Tom and Gerri's son Joe.  Spanning over the course of a year, the aptly named `Another Year' takes the time to expose the frailties in friendships as well as the lasting bond formed by those who share something special.  As the characters are introduced and incorporated into the fabric of Tom and Gerri's lives, we can see how the dynamic works between everyone.  Each character has their own identity, all but Tom and Gerri who seem to be mere props to `tie everyone together'.  That is probably my one quibble with this film.  I would have liked to see the two central characters feel a little more alive, especially Tom, but at the end of the day their reflective and observational personalities allowed the more aggressive characters to shine, so maybe it was for the best.<br /><br />We can't all be scene stealers.<br /><br />The film is broken down into four sections (Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), and those sections mainly consist of one elongated scene each, thus playing out much like a play would.  I actually adore this structure because it allows the dialog and character interaction to take center stage and really unfold beautifully, giving the characters rich development and persona's all their own that mesh and conflict and cause that feeling of awkward, uneasiness that lets the audience know that what is happening is `real', as in `authentic'.  And that is really one of the best assets this film has in its arsenal; it feels real.  The acting is all splendid, especially Lesley Manville who nails every ounce of Mary's emotional complexity.  She creates a character that is equal parts adorable and repulsive.  You can understand why Tom and Gerri love her, but you can also understand why she grates their nerves so excessively, and it is very hard to construct a character that obnoxious that doesn't make the audience long for their departure.  In fact, I kept hoping she'd come back the moment she faded from view.<br /><br />Parts of `Another Year' could have been cleaned up, especially in the first section, which took some time to pick up, but overall I really enjoyed what Leigh did with his characters here.  This is the type of film that demands subsequent viewings, for once is certainly not enough to fully `get' everything that Leigh is delivering.(Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter), and those sections mainly consist of one elongated scene each, thus playing out much like a play would.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I hardly ever post comments. But this is a must have for android. I now have 2 home screens compared to 5 previously. This coupled with swipepad has made me into a multi-taking god...samsung fascinate
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is the first app that I ever paid for. I tried the free version for a month or so before actually ponying up the cash, but even the free version was useful enough that it quickly became one of the cores of how I organize my home screens. Eventually I just wanted some of the additional functionality, and was happy to support the developer.<br /><br />This application allows you to create organizational tags for your apps and shortcuts. The paid version allows for you to tag tags, so you can have a nested folder structure on your home screen (click games, then brain teasers, then cut-the-rope).<br /><br />As you install new apps it will ask you to tag them so that they automatically show up where you want them. It's flexible, powerful, un-intrusive etc.<br /><br />Great App!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I didn't buy this through Amazon, but when I saw it show up on the featured daily app, I wanted to put in my two cents. This is the first app I ever paid for when I first got my Android. I tried the ad-based version first, and quickly paid to get rid of the ads.    My home screens are nice and neat, and I only use about 2 of my screens yet all my apps are right on my home screen, organized by category. Everything about the folders are customizable, from icons to naming to folder-in-folder.     This is a simple program that works like it says. I've never had a problem with it, and I recommend it to everyone.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|This is something that should come with every phone. Very easy to use and helps maintain a nicer home screen.   A Must have for everyone.

0061914177|4.0|Crush It! is a call to action for living an uncommon life.  Instead of going to school, getting a degree, work a career to gain experience, all while maintaining a sheet of paper that, most of the time, doesn't stand out from anyone else's, Gary proposes we take matters into our own hands.  Instead of working for years at a job that you aren't entirely excited about, why not work on something that sparks a passion?    All to often people enter the work force and devote all their time and energy into their new found profession, checking their hobbies at the door.  Complacency sneaks up on you as well.  Thinking we have a job for the rest of our lives when that just isn't necessarily true.  Why not make yourself recession proof and tap into that hobby you've loved your entire life?    In his book, Gary outlines just how easy it is to start your own business.  With the internet, social media, and crowd sourcing, starting up a business or marketing yourself to the world couldn't be easier (free too)!      Social media can even be carried over into a professional career.  Comcast wasn't well known for its customer service but a customer service rep decided to start up a Twitter account without any prompting and immediately became a superstar within the company and put Comcast's customer service on the map!    Great information and motivation about harnessing the technology age for your benefit!
159420229X|5.0|Foer writes some great passages about whether or not the \\"externalization\\" of our memories to devices like books and computers is a good thing. Besides that and the interesting content you'd expect, the story of the young author, living with his parents while struggling to make it as a journalist, really hit home for me. I think it would resonate with a lot of nerdy kids like myself, who came out of college in the last few years and had trouble finding the jobs they hoped for.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I had been looking for an app that would let me change app names and/or icons on my stock Thunderbolt and this one does the trick. In addition, it doesn't seem to suffer from the same problem (disappearing icons for apps in folders) that I get when I use the HTC folders. When using folders or shortcuts, performance is excellent with actions being accurate and fast - comparable to stock interface, no lag at all.    Just a quick update... I've been playing with this app quite a bit since I downloaded it this morning and I have to say that the more I use it, the more I like it.  It's quite flexible - you can use the installed icons or use something you created/downloaded.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|This book was published in 1969, a time of a lot of social change in America.  It immediately became a best seller.  It represented the spirit of the outlaw who is also a conservative family man, a legacy brought over from Sicily and now planted in American soil.  I read this book when it was first published and will never forget it.  Now, all these years later I read it again and I must say it still has the same impact.  Every character came alive on the page, and it was easy to understand the violence because I saw it through their eyes.<br /><br />This story is rooted in the old world, where vendettas are commonplace and people live in fear for their lives.  Don Corelone's story starts in Italy.  He fled to save his life.  Later, as an immigrant,  he fought for justice for the common people.  And yet he also demanded tribute money, ran gambling dens and forced competing olive oil companies out of business.  Murder was not unusual, but only for people who deserved it.  Thus is the myth of the compassionate, stern and loving Godfather, a truly American story.<br /><br />Don Coreleone had three sons.  The smartest, Michael, enlisted in the army during WW2, fell in love with a girl who was not Italian and didn't plan on following in his father's footsteps.  But circumstances changed when his older brother was gunned down and Michael enacted revenge.  This set the course for the rise of Michael as the next Don as the older Don slowly weakened while still running the family with wisdom and intelligence.<br /><br />This book is a real page turner.  I loved it and  literally couldn't put it down. It is the stuff of legend and I expect it will continue to be a best seller in years to come
B000VDUWMC|4.0|The book itself is supreme but..  How can a book based on Geography lack all of the figures constantly referenced from the Author...  It was a big disapointed from my first kindle version book!!!!
B004XJHBCE|4.0|This app looks nice and is fairly easy to use. It does everything it says it does, and it does those things well.   That being said, many of these features are already built in to the phone. Sorting contacts into categories has always been built in, and you could always add quickdial widgets. Sorting apps into categories was added in Gingerbread, and was in ADW before that (though poorly implemented).  The only thing that's new is adding folders to the desktop as widgets, and even that is not all that useful. If you've had your device for any amount of time, you've probably already organized your desktop the way you like it anyhow.  Overall, this is worth a perusal while it's free, or worth buying later if you're really picky about how your organizer looks.

1416583432|2.0|I was looking so forward to learning from this book but was disappointed in how little real information it contained.  So much postulating, so little confirmed data.  How does my dog view me, the world, other dogs?  I was looking forward to answers.  I think about my dog all the time and this book could be a transcription of my thoughts with lots of questions asked, observations offered, and no real answers.    I did learn that dogs with long snouts are more likely to pursue motion because of their vision on the horizon.  I can't think of anything else I learned.  Facts presented in this book were old news to me.  Since the author is a professor in a prestigious Ivy League university I was expecting results from original research but none were presented.    One factual error I found...  10 db (decibels) is a 10 times increase in power and 20 db is a 100 times increase.  The book implies 10 db is a 100 times difference.  The author got the math of decibels wrong.  I don't know why the author tried to explain the quantification of sound power because it adds no real understanding to dog hearing.
B000P0J0AG|5.0|I hadn't seen this since its 1995 heyday, but it has really stood the test of time. Nothing is dated even 16 years later. The Michael Mann script is brilliant, as is the photography and the classic Michael Mann/Miami Vice score. The action is as good as the \\"romantic\\" moments, and the classic Pacino/DeNiro moment in a coffee shop is unforgettable. Lots of bullets and gore, but forgivable this one time only. I laughed because the actor who plays the psycho killer in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" plays a cop here. Val Kilmer is top notch, too.
1594744769|5.0|Once upon a time there was a story, unlike any other story. It was a brilliant, creepy, heartwarming, adventure full of unforgettable characters of epic proportion. The name of that story? Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.    I found this book one day while wandering through blogland. As soon as I read the premise, I knew it was something I wanted to read. Then I saw the book trailer! I can honestly say that this trailer is the single best trailer I have seen to date. I have watched it many, many times. Then? I heard that they are going to be making the movie. I had to read this book! I will admit I was nervous when it arrived in the mail this week. What if it did not live up to the expectations I had for it? After the first page? All my worries were crushed and exploded on impacted! Do you remember the feeling that first book gave you? The one that took you away, to another world, another time and left you breathless and excited? This is what this book did to me. It took me back, back to a time, to a place in my heart where magic lives.    Words can not express how much I love this book! Just as Harry Potter, Narnia, Lord of the Rings, Alice in Wonderland and so many others have become Classics? So to, shall Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children...at least in my heart and soul. Every single one of these characters are brilliant, no matter how minor their role. They have all left their mark on my heart and I will never forget them.     In making my decision to purchase this amazing book, I decided to buy the hardcover instead of the ebook, my choice of reading format as of late. I am so very, very happy with my choice. Why? You need to have the hardcover to get the full effect and experience of this book. The book is filled with these creepy old vintage photos that add so much to this whole amazing experience known as Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.    In the end? I 100% recommend that EVERYONE read this book. It is for young and old and truly is a Classic in the making. Now watch these trailers and tell me you are not enticed and in need of devouring more!

0321687299|5.0|(yes I know the tags in the title won't alter font)    I recently purchased several books ranging from CSS3 to HTML5 to more specific things like jQuery and WordPress. In the bunch this book got left on the side, because I believed I had already read it. I progressed through the pile, making mental notes, and writing gems down. When I found this book to be empty of margin notes, and any abuse to the binding or cover, I was curious and started reading through it, or 'back' through it as I believed at the time.    I quickly started appreciating not only the content, but the structure. I found myself staring things, making notes in the margin, etc. This was going to be my go-to HTML5 book. It was not my only HTML5 book, I actually had purchased 3 well recommended books on the topic. I won't mention those other 2 books by name because I don't want this to come across as a brand loyalty review or anything. I want to make it clear that this is simply what it is at face value; a customer who stumbled upon a book that offers everything I was looking for in a reference, and it offers it in a well constructed format, with plenty of thought and example put into its pages. Of the 3 books on this subject that I purchased this was by far the smallest of the 3, at least in number of pages. In usefulness it was by far the most broad, yet well refined and concise reference.    I highly recommend this book. It has a wealth of information in its pages, and expresses and explains the why and how of things. Rather than simply saying an element was depreciated it talks about the why; how it was used in HTML4 and why it isn't necessary in HTML5, what it might have been replaced with, and why. There are plenty of other HTML5 books worthy of a spot on your shelf, but this one stays on my desk.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I bought this mic and tested on my D5100, and it delivers a great result. However it only records the left channel. So to achieve a stereo effect, you'll need to spend extra time on the editing and it is a hassle and a crippling process. I wish I knew about this before I made the purchase. But again it's a very affordable mic.<br />Do not buy if you're looking for a stereo mic!
0062060554|2.0|I was so excited to get this book from Amazon. When I told my husband about it, he instantly burst my little bubble by saying, \\"it sounds just like Memento..\\" I hadn't even thought of that! Oh well, there's no way it could be the same. Well, not exactly.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about this book is that it took so long to get into the story. By the middle of the book I still felt like I was in the first or second chapter, being introduced to the story. It was like an uphill battle, without the climax or fun fall down to the end. It was like come on, come on, come on, BAM! The end.<br /><br />Also, it was a bit predictable. I had assumed the story line very early on and I turned out to be right.<br /><br />Others may like it. It wasn't terrible. I'd lend it to someone for a read, but wouldn't recommend they pay full price for it.<br /><br />Happy reading! :)
B004KKZ45M|4.0|The book itself I must give five stars. This first novel by Agatha Christie really sets the groundwork for what would become the most successful and highly lauded mystery writing career ever.<br /><br />There are a few moments in the book where an image is references, yet this Kindle edition does not contain the images referred to. While it doesn't impede the flow of the story much, it would be nice if they had been included in this Kindle version.
0545123291|4.0|I was such a huge fan of Shiver. I was amazed by each detail Maggie placed inside the story. It was beautiful! Much of that continued with Linger, but I will say that I didn't love it as much. Sam and Grace go through a lot in Linger. Grace fights against her parents in order to stay with Sam. It seemed to be typical teenage drama but much more goes along with their love story. Something is happening with Grace and they don't know how to deal with it.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of multiple points-of-view and this book seemed to have too many. It often switched from Sam to Grace, to Isabelle and then Cole. I felt that even a majority of the book was focused on Isabelle and Cole..but honestly, that was fine with me because I preferred their story this time around. Sam and Grace were sooo depressed. I understood why but it just made the book harder to read. I felt myself dreading Sam and Grace's POV, and wanting to read more about Cole and Isabelle.<br /><br />Isabelle is a great character. She is tough, stubborn, and sarcastic. That made the perfect match for Cole. He played the role of the tough guy but there ended up being so much more to him than first expected. Cole has a lot of demons from his past and he soon discovers that no matter what, he can't run from his past life. Isabelle is still going through pain of her own and together they seemed to bring some hope to each other's lives.<br /><br />Sam and Grace are still strong characters and their level of love for each other cannot be denied. It goes beyond puppy love and each character goes through a lot to be together. They had several scenes that were completely adorable and I do really want to see what happens with them next.<br /><br />Even though Linger didn't grab me as much as Shiver did, it still built upon a fascinating story. It has many dramatic moments, twists, and surprises. I'm looking forward to reading Forever and seeing what's in store for these characters!
B003UESJH4|5.0|The King's Speech is one of the best, most moving, movies I have ever seen.  It's an amazing story that is so well performed by this all-star cast.  The Oscars this film has won were all very well deserved indeed.  What a delight!
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I've been on a major paranormal romance kick and had little interest in this book until I saw all the fantastic reviews. I decided to put my love of all-things-paranormal on hold and dive into \\"Beautiful Disaster\\". I give this a 3.5 stars overall but 4+ stars for the fantastic chemistry between the lead characters.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />- Travis. Yes, he's a frigging wreck and a big-league player and, frankly, not remotely the type of guy I'd ever imagine myself pursuing. But....he's just so darn sexy! And he has a big heart.<br />- Abby. I thought I had her number in the opening scene and was prepared for a story about an all-too proper young woman who falls for a guy from the wrong side of the tracks.  Boy was I wrong. She's got a lot of surprises up her sleeve and I can easily see why Travis was so attracted to her.<br />- The friends. Fitch, America, Shep...each had their own personalities and quirks and I enjoyed how well they played second fiddle to the lead characters.<br />- The chemistry. No need to explain that one!<br />- The author's ability to stretch out what is essentially a very long, very angsty \\"on again, off again\\" romance into an entire book without making me want to throw it against the wall halfway through.<br /><br />What I could have done without:<br />- The copious amounts of smoking, underage drinking, illegal fight clubs, and casual sex (as integral as they were to some of the better scenes in the book). I do like realism in my books and I think it's a bit silly to represent the high school/college experiences as one devoid of partying, sex, and other activities. But I must say I was a bit disappointed at how much the book relied on these activities to move the plot along. For example, was it really necessary to have Abby down 19 shots at her birthday party? Or to have Travis drinking and then hooking up with one (or more) women on a daily basis? Again, I realize much of this is part of the \\"college experience\\" and I'd be lying if I said I hadn't dabbled in a bit of this myself back in the day. But as the chapters flew by, the constant partying and lack of repercussions started to grate. I say less is definitely more.<br />- Parker.

0553801473|2.0|Martin's forte was his political intrigue and the unexpected way he killed off major characters.  Now, it seems everyone comes back from the dead, the political intrigue goes nowhere and he traded realistic fantasy for stupid absurd talking-tree fantasy.  Lots of people are on the move, but no one seems to get anywhere.  The Reek chapters are so over the top and frequent that I started to hate reading them - \\"Oh God, not another stupid internal rhyming dialogue\\" was a frequent thought.<br /><br />Martin has really started to let the size and scope of what he's doing overwhelm him.  It took five years for this...series of unresolved events.  I can only imagine how long we'll wait for more unresolved events, new POVs and new stupid rhymes from Reek (aka Theon).
0002247399|2.0|This book is forgettable. I just finished it reading it and I'm sitting here struggling to think of what actually occurred in the book and the answer is: not much. Some people sail, some people have sex, Tyrion makes jokes and rides a pig, and there are A LOT of inner monologues. That is the majority of the book. It feels cluttered, and even more viewpoints have been added. The writing is still good and there are some great moments in this book.<br /><br />But overall it's just disappointing. This is the result of 11 years of work?
B0031ES8P6|5.0|Bought this for my niece's 3rd birthday, along with a Hello Kitty backpack, and she loved it. Looks just like the picture and is the perfect size for little hands to hold onto.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|The quality of Jaycees' writing style isn't brilliant, maybe repetitive, however I don't think her LIFE varied much from day to day. The title, \\"A STOLEN LIFE\\" tells the tale....little details are all that she had to rely on for sanity....Please don't blame the victim here....My wish for Jaycee is that she is finding closure by putting into words the horrible circumstances of her captivity. The fact that she survived such horrific abuse by her captors all of those years is proof, beyond a doubt, of the amazing person she is and was. Abducted as a CHILD of eleven, she became a mother at fourteen, and accepted the responsibility for her daughters above all else...how many children would be able to do what she did?  May Jaycee find peace.....and financial security through the release of this book!  Thank you Jaycee for sharing, may you succeed in whatever you desire.
0131103628|5.0|I have had experience in x86 and PIC assembler, pascal, ADA, BASIC, and I wanted to play and contribute in the OSS world.    I have found this to be a detailed, very readable book for getting up to speed with C for those with some programming experience.    It is also shedding light on the utility of C in *nix generally for me.    Concise, information packed, this somewhat seminal K&R ANSI C textbook lived up to my expectations.    The GCC handbook also available from Amazon is a neat little book if anyone is struggling to get up and running with their compiler toolchain.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've been looking for an app like this for quite some time.  This is much more flexible and usable than the built-in AWD folders.  It looks great.  It includes several collections of good looking icons.  It works not only with apps but also with contacts and bookmarks.  This version supports nested labels.
0553801473|3.0|I had high hopes for this book; maybe too grandiose (but what do you expect after waiting 5 years).  I desired a return to the detailed, fast-paced immersive writing of the first three books in this series, after the bad taste Feast left in my mouth.  The uneven writing across chapters and surprise plot contrivances detracted from some truly glorious scenes.  Here's hoping GRRM stops listening to the mindlessly praising syncophants and \\"must needs\\" to return to producing quality writing.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I enjoyed the book. But was disappointed that the ending was a setup for book 2. It's a fun read.
0345529057|5.0|Just an amazing series, GRRM is a genius. The story captivates you, these books are very hard to put down, beware.
B004ULEEY8|1.0|So I felt like giving this a chance one evening, and it was a big mistake. Yes it is nothing new, yes, the CGI is used for all action scenes, and yes they use Marines in the movie. I hope that IF this movie made any money, that it went to feed the costs of our wars because the producers and actors deserve not a dime. The movie was lame and slow. You know how it will end and nothing will surprise you throughout the entire film. IMHO, no originality. There was no connection to the characters or their situations. I ended up forwarding through the movie just to get to the action parts, which were pretty decent, but nothing that will amaze you. Just another reason why you shouldn't waste your time/money on Hollywood these days.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|Not sure why people are giving this app a 1 star and I think its lame to give an app a 1 star review to counteract what you think is a fake review.  This app has been available on the Android Market for quite a while.  Folder Organizer is one of the most useful Android apps out there.  Purchased on the Android Market almost a year ago never had a problem with it taking too many resources and is way better than Androids built in folder functionality.  With this app you can also change an apps icon and place a shortcut to it on the home screen.
B004WJRJNQ|5.0|EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE SINGLE EDITION, IT'S A VERY GOOD PURCHASE. ONE OF THE BEST USA BANDS OF THE 90'S !!!!
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book - I've recommended it to many. The concept is very easy, but we don't often realize how much it makes sense.
0553801473|2.0|The Sub-plots thicken part B.  Of the ~5000 pages published thus far, the last 2000 have been sub-plots going nowhere.  Exceedingly uninteresting (there were a few moment though, so 2 stars),  I believe this can clearly be blamed on the poor editing at this point.
B004XANKVO|5.0|As far as someone who owns computer backpacks I am definitely not average.  Due to a combination of work and generous people who think a computer backpack would be the ideal gift for me, I have a LOT of them.  But none of them cost well over a hundred bucks.  Can this one be worth that much?<br /><br />The first thing I want to say immediately is for the amount of gear this bag holds it is remarkably compact.  Another way of putting it is that Thule are genuses at efficient design.  I can safely say I am more pleased with the various pockets and places this bag has than any other I own.<br /><br />This bag is totally \\"today\\" in that it has protected zones for not only a laptop but a tablet or BOTH, instantly making it my #1 choice for overnight trips or to be used in addition to other luggage for longer trips.<br /><br />Two of the most impressive features are the hard-shell accessory pouch at the top, a great place to store those expensive sunglasses or other breakables, and the Shove It pocket, which is essentially a large open area between the front and the back of the bag where you can throw a newspaper, sandwich, sweater, ballcap, whatever for instant access.  A word of caution though, anything thrown in there is subject to falling out ... the two side cinches only partially pull the pocket shut.  I've never seen another bag with either of these two features.<br /><br />The zippered clothing compartment is big enough for a change of clothes, some swim shorts and maybe another pair of shoes.  Watch the video on this page, it does a great job of showing off all of these pockets.<br /><br />The little pocket on the very bottom is also a nice touch for things like chargers for your laptop or cell phone.<br /><br />Since I just got the bag I can't say how long it will last but the construction quality is undeniably first class.  If I rank the bag on two things - versatility and quality of construction - that will answer my initial question if it's worth it.  The answer is yes.<br /><br />The final thing that is important to most of us is how does it look?  Well, it won't win any awards for cutting edge styling, it is low-key and basic black but it's one of those items that it only takes one look at to think \\"classy\\".<br /><br />If backpacks are part of your daily life style why go cheap?  I could not be happier than with the Thule Crossover.  Maybe I'll start giving my other backpacks away ;-)to most of us is how does it look?

B002SR2PKG|5.0|I read this book more than 15 years ago. I was in college at the time and it was the most scarying book I've ever read!! I could tread on an gallery plate in the street without remembering the face of the clown turning into the monster with its evil and monstrous teeths.<br /><br />until now I could make a breefing sumary of this book. IT marked me. I trully don't recomend it for teens. It gave me fully nighmares and it took me almost a year to read it. Because of how scary I was as a 15 year teen.<br /><br />Do you want a ballon?!
0062060554|3.0|The book had a good premise but at times was monotonous.  It was also very predictable.  I had figured out the plot before I was even half way through.  Even though I knew how it was going to end, I was disappointed in how the author left the story.
B004E0Z4XK|5.0|After constantly listening to the Burton/Mercer Broken Bells album for the past year, now comes Burton's Rome collaboration which I'll be constantly hearing for the next year!! What a beautiful record! The combination of vocal tracks and the lush instrumentals is flawless. Luppi, Jones and White add greatly to the final product. Ennio Morricone has always been one of my favorite composers and this 'soundtrack' really captures the feel of his music. Finally a suggestion for Norah Jones. You might want to consider doing an entire album with Brian Burton producing and Burton/Luppi writing the songs! Its certainly an album I would buy!
B0012GMW34|5.0|These guys fell for the divine pap of Sri Chinmoy, and inadvertantly got him more devotions, money and followers than ever before. Sadly, Chinmoy was found to be a fraud and Carlos and John were eventually able to move away from such nonsense and be creative, sans guru. But, let's discuss the music, shall we? For this is why this album stands the test of time as a great tribute to John Coltrane. The three longer pieces are jams, with Billy Cobham, Jan Hammer, Larry Young and other session cats reaching those high notes inside the cathedral basement of Saint John the Divine in NYC. Completed it in about a week, as I recall. I would imagine they may have only done the album in less than a few takes, because the jamming effect takes mainstage here on the longer pieces. But then, there's the gem, the acoustic version of \\"Naima,\\" one of the truly great love songs anyone has ever written. If you are a guitarist like me, trying to find the correct tablatures online or at a music store for this is nearly impossible. Trying to play this song entirely by ear is difficult, but challenging. The guitar of Santana seems not to have been miked loud enough, and it does not come through as succint as McLaughlin's. However, this song reaches heights one can only dream of for many acoustic players. I would like to see this album digitized so as to perhaps get more clarity and instrument separation of such a magnificent sound. I would encourage players to make attempts to play along with these pieces, as certainly it will improve one's playing and intensity. Nowdays, McLaughlin is playing synth music, and Carlos is still rocking with Santana. To have seen them together at live shows would have been quite something. Those of you that were that lucky, my hat's off to you. I was lucky to see Mahavishnu Orchestra as well as John in a solo show. I also have seen Carlos with Santana many times. But this band, my goodness, they were magnificent. I still play this album on long drives, and it is terrific. I would imagine Mclaughlin would say \\"that was a long time ago.\\" Yes, but still. Wonderful. Worth every penny.is terrific. I would imagine Mclaughlin would say \\"that was a long time ago.\\" Yes, but still. Wonderful. Worth every penny.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|My husband and I are huge movie watchers and have been disappointed that great movies haven't been coming out lately. We decided to watch this for the hell of it and it turned out ot be great! I don't want to tell you too much because people tend to give away the whole movie when writing a review, but I will tell you that the ending was amazing and had me still thinking about the movie hours after it wsa already over! This is a MUST see/buy. You won't regret it!
B002QBS9KE|3.0|Had ordered these ear buds for my Plantronics Bluetooth. Unfortunately the model has changed. The ear buds I received have little locking tabs on them. The ones for my Plantronics Bluetooth are just rubber like push on. I matched up the type of ear bud by picture of the bluetooth. The warning is be careful of what you order. My mistake or model change cost me 4 days of time waiting and about $10.
0062060554|5.0|I reserved this book at the library after reading a quick blurb about it on CNN.com.  Good move! I found the book to be a true page-turner, tightly written, no false moves.  One of the best I've read this year.    I am surprised the New York Times has not yet reviewed it.
0783228457|3.0|This is not a critique of the movie itself (which you should definitely watch), or the Criterion releases.  This applies only to the Universal DVD, which blinded my good judgement with its low price.    The details on Amazon's listing are wrong (hopefully to be updated soon).  The Universal DVD release of this film is not anamorphic.  It is not enhanced for widescreen televisions.  No 16x9.  However you want to say it.    If picture quality matters to you, or if you like bonus features beyond \\"production notes\\", just pay the extra money and go with Criterion.
0553801473|3.0|How can anyone give this book 5 stars?  It makes me wonder if those people are paid to post good reviews or they mistakenly posted a review that belonged to another book.<br /><br />Here's why this book should never receive 5 stars:<br /><br />1) The story moves extremely slowly and is clogged up by filler.<br /><br />If the author removed many of the unnecessary descriptions of food, clothing, and lineages; there would be only 150 pages worth of actual story.  But even if we were given just the story, most people will soon find out that three-quarters of the plot is wasted on describing the travels of characters getting to somewhere important (it's comparable to how Brienne was aimlessly traveling to find Sansa in AFFC.) Then finally, the last quarter of the book teases you with what happens when some (not all) of the characters actually reach their destination.  The pace of the story is so horrible you will be screaming to ask for progress -- only to be disappointed more.<br /><br />2) Previous cliffhangers are not dealt with (such as the fate of Brienne, Sansa, Catelyn), while even more cliffhangers are shamelessly tacked on to the already frustrating amount of loose ends.<br /><br />What happened to Brienne? How is Catelyn alive?  What happens to Sansa? Where is Rickon? ----  None of these are answered.  In fact, we will only have more cliffhangers by the end of the book.<br /><br />3) There are even MORE unnecessary point of views from new and old characters, including new plot lines.<br /><br />Uh... how many characters do we have now?  Do we really need more?  How about you start finishing the stories of OTHER characters before you tack on new ones that further overwhelm this already exhausting story.<br /><br />4) Nothing important gets accomplished in this book.<br /><br />After you are done reading this book you will literally sit there, stare at it, and wonder why it needed 1000+ pages to tell the grueling slow paced story.
B001QXE0OC|4.0|Selena Gomez's debut album is mostly upbeat and happy music, something kids can dance and sing along to. The only slow track is \\"The Way I Loved You.\\" For a debut album, this one meets expectations. She is a rising Disney star and this album is aimed at kids. So no, none of the songs have a lot of \\"substance\\" in them. Her voice is rather strong and she will definitely delight little kids as their next favorite artist. The lyrics booklet (one of the reasons I prefer physical CDs) is also well made, packed with colorful photos.    Overall, the album is a fresh start in the music industry, but is not award-winning material. For kids who want to have a great time, this album is perfect for them. For anyone else looking for deep, meaningful music, I suggest to look elsewhere.
0345529057|5.0|Great read.  The TV series did a good job covering most of the book.  I'm looking forward to reading the next four books of the series.
B003FSTN52|5.0|While scanning my DVR, I noticed that I had the first 32 episodes of \\"Good Wife\\" in the \\"keep\\" bin.  Usually, if I start keeping large numbers of episodes, that is my signal to go buy the DVD.  In this case, the DVD was scheduled, but not quite out, so I pre-ordered.    When the package came, it held six full length DVD's.  Besides the 23 episodes from the first season, they help a plethora of extra features, outtakes (eh, not impressed with outtakes), writers' discussion, character profiles, just a lot of good stuff.    Bottom line, this set is not nearly as expensive as it seems at first glance.  You get a lot of good stuff for your Euro.  If you like the series, I recommend it, highly.
B003Y5H54W|1.0|How in the world could Billy Burke and Amanda Segfried star in this awful movie.  I've never seen such a let down.  I can't even describe the thing.  It was terrible.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  In fact, if I could sell it back I would.  I would not give it any stars at all but the system won't let you give it 0 stars.
B005529BDK|5.0|This is a fun game that is easy to learn. I was also surprised by how much I had to exercise my brain in this game. It isn't so much just lining up colors but also looking for opportunities to make bigger matches and flipping over coins to work towards your advantage.    I played for a little bit and saw the geniusness in the game. Whoever programmed this did a great job of making it different than other games and giving us a nice, fun, brain-twisting game.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Right away...from the opening sequence of this classic film...you'll know that you are in for a real treat with the BluRay version.  Even if you've seen this movie hundreds of times, this version of the film will amaze you.  The mountain, the blades of grass, the reflection on the stream - everything - are absolutely and perfectly crystal clear.  It is amazing, and carries through the rest of the film with the same power.  It literally blew me away, and convinced me of the power of BluRay in the presentation of classic films in a new and wonderful way.  Though I do not purchase many BluRay movies, I can honestly say this one is worth having in the collection.  It makes the masterpiece even more masterful.  Highly recommended!
B004SIIBGU|4.0|This Ap, used on my Incredible, allowed me to keep up with an auction at all times with very timely notifications. I used it to make the winning bid with only 4 seconds left!
0756404738|5.0|So I read about this book in my local newspaper's Sunday book review section. It struck a chord with me as being just the type of book I like so I picked up Name and ordered AWMF.     I read these two books back to back (much to my wife chagrin) as I just could not put them down. It dang near became a problem because I was taking a college class at the time and would rather read the book than study for a mid-term...    Well, since finishing both books, I have turned on these two books to four people that all loved them. I don't get the one star rantings that are going on in some of these reviews, Patrick Rothfuss is poised to become one of THE great American fantasy writers, he is just simply incredible.    The story sucks you in with an older man who tells the story of his life. He weaves this tale in and out of his current life. The early part of the story was just riveting. While some people have said the first book is better than the second, I found them to be seamless.    It blows me away that this is supposed to be just a trilogy, I feel like there is alot of story left, and even if the third book is 1000 pages it doesn't seem like it would be long enough. The good news is Patrick won't drag us along for several more books.     When done, this may be one of the best fantasy trilogy's ever.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|Just a well done compilation of Guns n' Roses song 'videos' along with awesome footage from past concerts for the Paradise City cut.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|One of the most useful android apps I have, i'd say one of top 3 for me out of 200+ I have. Absolutely great on Xoom to augment standard launcher, I sort all my apps to categories/labels and each category is easily accessible as folder view. And its widgets look awsome with dark theme. Very convenient on my N1 as well where I setup same categories.  Ignore those fake 1 star reviews, try it out - if you are an organized person, you'll love this app.
0553801473|2.0|After the first three books i was convinced we finally had a Fantasy genius on our hands, who broke down all the typical traditional fantasy story telling walls, and he did it without Elves, Dwarves or Goblins !<br /><br />Like millions of others, the first 3 books left me salivating for more in a way i never had before.<br /><br />Book 4 shocked pretty much all of us leaving us wondering if Martin was pulling a fast one.<br /><br />Book 5 leaves us in no doubt, he IS pulling a fast one, or rather an excruciatingly slow painful boring one.<br /><br />I gave up reading Jordan after book 3, as it was obvious he would milk his single successful series to death.<br />Here however, i feel Martins reasons are different. He really dosnt know where he is going, or rather, he isnt confident that where he is going is the right place to go, thus he \\"Dallies\\" for 1000 pages.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I get so absorbed while playing and riding the stationary bike that an hour flies by.  The game gets so intense I find myself pedaling much faster than I do when not playing.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I first used the Lite version many months ago, and I liked it so much that I paid for the full version.  This is totally worthy as a free app-of-the-day on Amazon!  People on here who give it 1 or 2 stars just don't seem to understand what this is app does and how it works differently from the stock Android OS capabilities.  I've never noticed it as a waste of CPU or any of the other resource complaints I've read on here.  I use WatchDog to notify me of overly-busy apps, and this never gets flagged as a trouble maker.    Here are the ways I use this app:  * tag apps as they are installed (eg. Games, Tools, Internet) [tags are custom too, make your own]  * view a sortable list of your apps - sometimes I like to view my apps sorted by install date, so I can see the most recently installed ones.  As far as I can tell, the stock OS doesn't do this, and most home launcher replacements don't either.  * view only specific subsets based on tags, such as only seeing a list of Games  * create folders for home screens that are automatically kept up to date based on tags - create a Games folder, and the next time you install an app and tag it as a \\"Game\\", it will show up in that folder    Also to mention the Honeycomb interface is quite nice.  Could be improved a bit (the left/right arrows to apply tags doesn't make much sense), but nothing to worry about.  This developer does update the app somewhat regularly, so if you think something is awkward right now, hold tight.      If you actually take more than 5 minutes to play with this app, it will make sense.  People who claim otherwise are just being dense.  As far as permissions go, I see nothing out of place.  However, if you are that paranoid about permissions, then you'll never get to be an Android power user by taking advantage of useful apps such as this.  Stick to the stock OS and stop giving 1 star reviews to awesome apps.

B004SIMNF0|5.0|Hi, first and foremost the SpiderPro Single Camera Holster System is awesome and possibly the most practical way to carry a heavy pro-body camera around and still have handsfree capabilities to arrange subjects for your shots as well as being able to take the strain off of your arms and shoulders.  As a wedding photographer, it is not uncommon to be on the go for 8 - 10 hours with two pro-body cameras on you at all times.  Having the holster allows you to accomplish this with the least amount of strain to your body.    However, if I wanted this review to be more about the outstanding customer service and support I received when I had cause to contact Wolfe's Camera Shop.  I had the best customer experience ever.  I received the SpiderPro and it was missing the SpiderPro Pin.  When I contacted Wolfe's Camera Shop and got a response from Brad, he not only helped me understand what might have happened he offered to overnight me the missing piece.  True to his word I received the pin in record time.  Seldom do people follow through like this and my experience with Brad and Wolfe's Camera Shop would make me sing their praises to all that listen and I will definitely buy from them again and recommend my friends and family members to do also.  Great Products, Great Prices and Great Customer Service!
B003Q6D282|5.0|First of all, after reading all the negative reviews on IMDb, I was happy to see so many positive ones here.  This is a terrific SAW movie; it ties up all the loose ends, and it moves at a breathless pace.  Even watching it the third time, it held me spellbound.    But the final chapter?  Hoffman is still alive, and in much better condition than at the end of SAW 6.  Doctor Gordon is alive and apparently willing to continue Jigsaw's work.  And who's to say that Bobby, now that he is a true survivor and not a fake one, will not want to help out Gordon?    So I predict that Halloween 2011 will bring SAW VIII.  And I hope it does.  This is one of the best horror franchises in the past two decades.  I'd like to see it go on forever.

1451629184|5.0|I wasnt sure what to expect when i first started reading the book. After the first chapter i was hooked. This book brought so many tears to my eyes, i feel so hard for this woman and what she went through. I love how she is not embarrassed about what happened to her and doesnt want to protect the garridos. She exposed what they did to her and who they really are. I am so proud of Jaycee for writing this book and being brave and strong like she speaks about in her book. I wish her nothing but the best and hope that she continues to grow everyday. God bless your heart.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I saw this series when it originally aired on the Discovery Channel in the U.S., and it became appointment television for me.  Sunday nights became the night when I knew I would have my mind blown away by some of the incredibly imagery from this series: a great white shark hunting seals, a pride of lions attacking an elephant at night, the funny mating dance of the birds of paradise.  Although this box set has the David Attenborough narration, I think I'm one of the few people that enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's American narration more.  It may be because it's what I heard first when watching the series, but I also think her female voice was a plus, like Mother Earth was explaining to me what I was seeing (I think it was much better than Oprah Winfrey's narration on Life).  I loved how this series didn't get preachy with the effects of humans on animal habitats, but instead just showed the wonders of these creatures in their natural state.  If you want to show off your new high-def TV, this series has the perfect visuals for you to do so.

0553801473|2.0|Alright, so I don't want to hate for this entire thing, so I'm going to start off with the high points:<br /><br />1. The Theon chapters: Just as Jaime sustained the previous book, Theon provides a much-needed lifeline throughout.<br />2. The Selmy chapters: Same function, but fewer of them, and they only show up later.<br />3. The last chapter in a series favorite's story: This one is ambiguous because I don't know whether Martin will have the balls to let him stay dead or not, but if so, not even I saw that coming.<br />4. The writing: It's evident that Martin is still an immensely gifted writer and the language is often beautiful without going over the top.<br /><br />Now let's get into the somewhat more extensive list of things that didn't work so well:<br /><br />1. The length/plot ratio: 959 pages. Very little happens.  Towards the end there are more almost-happenings.  This is not the same.<br />2. The Dany/Tyrion/Jon chapters: Tyrion sails on a ship, develops awkward friendship with female dwarf. Jon and Dany have the same chapter over and over again about not knowing what to do.  Dany's gets interesting at one point later on, then goes back to being boring.<br />3. The last chapter in a series favorite's story: He's not going to let him stay dead. Once he brought out Lady Stoneheart, I knew this whole \\"anyone's fair game\\" thing was over.<br />4. More stuff no-one cares about in Dorne: I think this speaks for itself.  Thankfully it's less than it was in AFFC.<br />5. Cliffhangers in last book not resolved in a satisfactory fashion: I wanted some blood!
B004XJHBCE|4.0|Bought this for my Xoom rit off the bat. Easy to use. Customizable icons neat-my 3 year old knows to click the picture of his Hot Wheels to get to hid apps. Real neat trick if you use the empty theme on a widget to get smaller icons and get a cleaner looking home screen. Kinda bummed I didn't get it free (like you can today), but easily a worthwhile purchase.

0061134007|2.0|This is the second Jo Nesbo book I have read.  I was so excited, but I did not read the last 20-ish pages because I was so tired of it.  I give 3 stars because for most of the book I was interested to see how things turned out, but when I realized that I had figured it out, and still had a hundred or so pages!, I started to lose interest.  The worst part, though, was (not really a spoiler, but maybe gets close) when the person starts recounting all of the things that actually happened during WWII from the beginning of the book, I just could not go through it all again.  It seemed like it was a book about the WWII stuff and then a book about modern Norway, but someone put them in a blender and wound them together.  In fact just in writing this I changed to 2 stars.  I was really disappointed.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|This DVD is absolutely amazing, I never get sick of watching it and there are a lot of extras that you wont want to miss if you're a Gilmour fan.
B003UMW66G|5.0|This is hands down the most beautiful movie ever filmed in my opinion.  If you really want to test your A/V equipment and your perception of color and depth I would really encourage you to buy the Blu-Ray over the DVD set.  The movie itself is amazing, but it is driven by the quality of the cinematography.  They work in harmony beautifully and tell an amazing story that will keep you engrossed throughout.  There are some issues with the audio not being fully decompressed in all languages, but the visuals (in this case) are what sell the movie...not the sound as some would lead you to believe.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I'll keep this review short and sweet, if you are a Pink Floyd or Gilmour fan, you will not regret buying this DVD.  These guys are at the top of their game here and it shows, what an amazing performance.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This series is really well done and the Blu-Ray only adds to the quality of the films.<br /><br />(1) The first film is very understated in its action sequences.  Only 1 explosion, completely justified, and a chase scene that rivals any in film history.  To get an idea of the accuracy just watch the sequence when the police officer on the motorbike flips over the car and smacks his helmet.  Every sound is authentic and really adds to the overall product.  I will say that the greatest disappointment in the films is the female lead played by German actress Franka Potente.  Being of German decent and speaking German quite well I can say that she over acted many scenes and was never really a well-developed character.  She just whines throughout the whole movie being surprised by the same issues over and over again and saying scheiße every two seconds.<br /><br />(2) The second film is where it gets a little fuzzy on cinematography, but the story is so sound that you don't mind the seizure inducing camera movements.  Again the action is understated and all reactions seem appropriate.  The opening scene of Bourne and Marie crossing the bridge being chased by a sniper is still my favorite seen (see above for reference).  The new director I think takes the 'sense of action' idea a bit too far, but again the Blu-Ray captures everything in the scenes and the sounds perfectly.<br /><br />(3) The third and final Matt Damon Bourne movie is a nice combination of the first two films.  The scenes are well thought out and the plot is quite deep and comes to a solid conclusion as to why and how he became the way he is.  You will get a little bit of the blur 'sense of action' junk from the second film but it is much reduced and returns to the actual story.<br /><br />Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this set to anyone who is a fan of spy movies.  While Bourne and James Bond are really nothing alike, because of the series success they are constantly compared.  If you like big explosions, gadgets, and amazing vehicles and women keep watching the Bond films I certainly do (Skyfall is Amazing!).  If you like deeper characters, realism, and amazing hand to hand combat then Bourne is for you.  I like them both, but they should be held as exclusive from one another.  I think the Blu-Ray, like most films, is really only needed for cinephiles or audiophiles. So if you are a general movie watcher the normal DVD set should be fine.
0316098329|5.0|An AWESOME book! I was a little taken aback at first, when you start reading and realize the perspective is from the eyes of a child. But as you read, you are sucked into such a fabulous, inspiring, scary, sad, and emotional story, you cannot put the book down!

B00000DF6O|5.0|This B.B.King album is just made to mellow you out on a hot summer evening. \\"Blues on the Bayou\\" is great sound and BB really gives it his all, his voice like you seldom hear it. He wrote all the songs, which sound like they are already old favorites from long ago, he really captured the feel of the blues. The backup band is perfectly matched to his way of playing and I think every song is great, no bad ones here. (plus, if you already have his other albums you have more than enough of \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" to last you, it's not on this one)Love the laid back mellow sound of this album, which will get lots of play.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Where does your imagination lead you? Blowup is a 1966 film directed by Michelangelo Antonioni, his first English-language film. Right off this is arguably a pretentious filmmakers dream come true. The level of style over substance in this film borders on comical yet somehow it all works well. It is true that a person could make the argument that this film is a major in depth critique on the roots of imagination. On the other hand you could also make the argument that this film is merely a romp that mixes attractive female models with illegal substances.  The hero in this film is a glamorous photographer Thomas (David Hemmings). He is really a pompous jerk but the kind people can relate to. Thomas exudes relatability because he is alone. This is a story about alienation. In that sense the film is timeless. Blow Up takes place in London in the mid 60s. It is a time capsule of style. The photographer is cruising around the city and stops to take a few pictures of a random couple in the park. It turns out that the pictures he took miraculously reveal that there was a murder in progress. This leads to him having a suggestive and revealing attractive woman in his apartment. One thing leads to another. If you want to be happy then be happy. If you want to be sad so be it. The real beauty of this interesting film is that it really leaves it up to you. You might even dislike Blowup but good luck looking away or turning it off. You never truly know what will happen next. The soundtrack was scored by Herbie Hancock. There is also a particularly unique performance by the Yardbirds where everyone in the audience is really just to cool to care. Sound familiar? Borrow this one from the library. It will ultimately remind you of a time that is very similar to now. That is the power of Blowup.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Personally I did not like this movie, compared to all the other 7... (Yes!!! I've seen all 8 films)<br />I didn't hate it either, but there were many changes from the book (emissions & additions) that really upset me and many other fans.<br />One thing I will say (to people that have read Yates's bashing comments) about the direction & production is:<br />1-STOP bashing on David Yates (director) people... He did not ruin the movie! He's only the director not the screenwriter (who adapts the book 2 screen version)<br />2-Too many unnecessary changes to the screen version that omitted the real action of the book<br />3-Although I'm not a fan of David Yates, he's a decent director and did a great job in the final movies (Deadly Hallows 1 & 2)<br />4-STOP BASHING ON DAVID YATES... If anything, hate & yell at Steven Kloves who's the one that writes the scripts. Also yell & complaint to JK Rowling for allowing the changes to the book... NOT DAVID YATES!!!<br /><br />***OMG, I can't wait to have all 8 DVDs... I love HP***
B000FVE3AC|4.0|I have had this watch for 4 or 5 years, (can not remember what year I bought it).  All and all it has been a good watch.  It is large, but I am a big guy so I do not really notice the size.  It has been in the water a lot, no problems.  Was not two worried about the band clasp, when I dive it is under my wet suit.  It has not come undone while I swim laps.  I have two objections to this watch; 1. The bezel scratches easily  ( I am hard on watches, the good news the crystal still looks good)  2. The automatic movement does not seem to be compatible with watch winders.  I have tried two different winders, neither would keep it wound.  It stays wound while you wear it.  Because the bezel is so beat up I have been using it as a work watch, it is a sturdy watch.
B00004YTIQ|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit hesitant to order knowing that people were experiencing some issues with how well the cover actually covered.  Well, for the price I was willing to take the chance.  I am now questioning those low ratings since the cover works perfectly.  It fits well and stays on with no issues after 4 weeks of use.  I could understand a problem if your pool is too large (obviously) and even too small.  Make sure your pool size is just under the cover dimensions and slide the tie down rope along the bottom of the pool to secure it and you should be fine.
B004WPYNY8|5.0|Are you paying attention, Dream Theater? THIS is how heavy prog-metal is done!<br /><br />Kicking off with the 10-minute, epic opus \\"Iconoclast\\", this record picks right up where the excellent \\"Paradise Lost\\" record left off and doesn't let off the gas for a seoond; if anything, it's even better! The powerhouse duo of Michael Romeo and Russell Allen have become a serious musical force to be reckoned with. The combination of Michael's epic, HUGE riffs and face-melting, memorable solos along with Russell's diverse and powerful vocals are the perfect blend of power and precision. The rest of the band is just as good, and the grooves laid down by Jason Rullo and Michael Lepond are ENORMOUS, and provide the perfect foundation for the melodic fury of Romeo and keyboardist Michael Pinnella, whose muscular, intertwining lines and scorching shred trade-offs are the meat and potatoes of the Symphony X sound.<br /><br />The truly amazing thing about this band is that for all the across-the-board incredible musicianship on display here, it never interferes with or detracts from the actual SONGS, and make no mistake, it's the SONGS that elevate Symphony X above the rest of the competition. For all the aggression that can be found here, there are also plenty of great melodic hooks in abundance. The chorus sections of songs like Dehumanized, Children Of A Faceless God, The End Of Innocence and When All Is Lost provide great melodic counterpoint to the overall power and aggression of the record. Russell Allen is truly one of THE great metal singers working today; the guy has Dio-like power, grit and snarl, but can also sing clean, precise parts with equal aplomb. He and Michael are the creative heart and soul of this band, and I can only hope they'll continue on for many years to come setting the gold standard for excellence in what great progressive heavy metal should sound like.<br /><br />If you've ever been a fan of Symphony X in the past, or progressive metal in general, DO NOT MISS this record, and make sure you get the special edition with the three bonus tracks, they're simply too good to miss!make sure you get the special edition with the three bonus tracks, they're simply too good to miss!
B0000AUHPK|5.0|This is a well-acted and good production of the classic engrossing but disturbing tale of two somewhat immature lovers, a wild, self-centered, brusque, uneducated, vengeful man and a beautiful, somewhat silly, frequently smiling girl who is unable to make good decisions. The film lacks the heavy morbidity that pervades the Emily Bronte's novel, and this is good.<br /><br /> Heathcliff, a gutter waif, is brought to Wuthering Heights as a child by charitable Mr. Earnshaw who tells his son and daughter that from now on they should consider him their brother. Hindley, the brother, takes an immediate strong dislike to the boy, while his sister Cathy loves him. She and Heathcliff form a star crossed deep and stirring romance, swearing eternal fidelity. Earnshaw dies and Hindley forces Heathcliff to be the house servant. Cathy meets Linton, a rich young man, who falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Cathy, thinking that Heathcliff is not in listening, tells a servant that she is thinking of marrying Linton because a marriage to Heathcliff would degrade her. Heathcliff rushes off and does not hear her say that she loves Heathcliff; he is her heart and soul; in fact she is Heathcliff.<br /><br /> Heathcliff is gone for two years during which time, since he is gone, she marries Linton. He returns rich, determined to have Cathy despite her marriage and determined on revenge. The rest of the tale tells about his revenge and how it destroys every one of his generation and the next.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I'm a big fan of the original film [[ASIN:B001MYIXAC Let The Right One In]] and I've got to admit I watched this expecting not to like it. Despite that, I was pleasantly surprised!    Matt Reeves re-make keeps closely to the Swedish film apart from some obvious changes like moving the action to New Mexico. The story - a sort of pre-teen horror romance - is really touching and will appeal to anyone who felt like a misfit at school and/or wanted that special friend when they were growing up. The acting is superb, especially from the two young leads with Chloe Moretz (who you might recognise as the little sister from [[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]]) particularly strong. She really captures something ancient, youthful, magical yet terrifying.    Having said all that I didn't find it as good as the original. There's more horror and less subtlety. In fact several aspects which are handled very delicately in the Swedish version - the 80s setting, the paedophilic angle - are spelt out here. I guess it shows the difference between American and European film-making. And thank heavens they kept out the scene where Abby becomes a vampire! It's seriously misjudged - though you can check it out in the DVD 'Special Features'.    If you've seen the original version this is definitely worth watching. If you haven't, and don't mind subtitles, watch that one first.
0553801473|3.0|Well, I waited anxiously for this book to come out and was really disappointed.  I am quite new to the series, and the first 4 books flew.  But, this last one never picked up speed.  Yes, Tyrion made me laugh a lot and Daenerys chapters were interesting, but nothing seemed to happen.  Each chapter I kept expecting something to happen.  It was very slow reading this time along and I hope I will not have to wait 5 years for all these plots he's built up to resolve.  Still I am a huge fan, but I really hope his next book comes out quick.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Who wouldn't like to be extremely smart? But being extremely smart also would mean that you would be able to easily outsmart a bunch of ignorant rough necks.<br /><br />Also being very smart would mean that you would know that discretion is the better part of valor. Unfortunately the smarts that they were given really wasn't all that limitless. Then on the down side there are the blackouts and the psychotic murderous behavior.<br /><br />The long and short of it is that these persons allowed greed I suppose to really cloud their judgment and then had to deal with the consequences.<br /><br />While this is an interesting film, it is really an oxymoron. But if it was written without these flaws, it then may not have been as interesting. Hence we are left with a limitless dilima.  Watch the film and enjoy it , but don't think too hard about it.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|First thing - I almost didn't load this because of the 1 star reviews claiming this is a new app so older reviews are bogus, questioning why it wants browser history so must be malware, etc.  Well, if you look at the history of this in the Google Market and online you'll see it's been out since last year.  As to browser history - it appears to use that to allow a special folder of your most recently used bookmarks (a GREAT tool IMO.)  So, it would appear those 1 star reviews are the bogus ones.   Anyway, I had been using Go Launcher EX's folders (really the main reason I use Go Launcher) but in the short time I've been playing around with this FolderOrganizer I'm finding it MUCH more versatile and easier to use.  I love the easy way to add apps, the custom icons for the widgets, and the extra folders such as bookmarks and recent apps.  If I had known about this app before it being out today as Amazon's free app of the day, I would have gladly paid for it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I did P90X for 3 months before this. I think have noticed a better fat shred with Jillian's DVD....I can't believe I am saying that but it is true. Much more aerobic. I use 2 of the 3 programs each time so I get a 30-40 min workout. There are 3 workouts to choose from, so I have 2 in mind and I do the warm up and work out of the first one I choose then skip the warm up for the second one but do the main work out and the cool down. So it ends up being a nice 30-40 min workout for me. I believe you can make any workout tougher by upping the weight, not taking the breaks they take to talk, etc. so I can't say which is harder, between P90X or Jillian. I just make sure I am challenged throughout whatever workout I choose. I think this was worth the money spent by a busy mom with little time to workout!

0553801473|1.0|Time Magazine needs to take back their statement that GRRM is the \\"American Tolkien.\\"  Tolkien was never this tedious, not even in the Silmarillion (which sorely tested my patience).  Hell, I'd take a book of JRR's lengthy elvish ballads over this dreck any day of the week.<br /><br />I lost patience with this series 2 books ago, but I felt revitalized after watching the superlative HBO series this spring.  I think that made things worse, actually, since Peter Dinklage was so amazing as Tyrion and in this book Tyrion is reduced to drivel.<br /><br />Other reviewers have covered the many problems with this book already, so I won't rehash.  I will say that it is now clear to even the most devoted GRRM fans that he has gotten to full of himself to write a decent book anymore.  He believes his own press and as a result has become a pretentious wind-bag who needs a swift kick in the pants and a fascist editor who will slash his work to the bone.
B00004R99F|5.0|any Goofy fan will absolutely LOVE this movie!!!!!  We went from Goofy's classic cartoon shorts to \\"Goof Troop\\" where his son, Max, was introduced and now we get a full length movie!!!! I really wish more films were made! Disney Studios really need to make that happen LOL  But this movie, beginning to end, was great! Good music, great story, and a nice growing understanding relationship between Goofy and his son. I think this movie was amazing and a real feel good movie. I saw it in theaters and i still watch it to this day. Real great and funny movie.   The original characters, Pete and PJ, are also in the movie. Sadly, Pete's wife, daughter and puppy aren't in it. I really wish they were.

B0053Q9DHW|4.0|When I first saw this version I was initially disappointed because all my favorite quotes from the book had been omitted. Even the ending was missing one of my favorite lines.  Once I could over come that and look at the movie without my past prejudices, I grew to really love this movie.  As many of the other reviewers have stated, I too have see all the movie and TV versions of Jane Eyre and have read the book countless times.  What a joy it was for me to see the director bring something new to the interpretation. The Gothic feel and look to the movie is breathtaking.  I thought the two leads did an outstanding job conveying the passion that would have existed between two people from a different era.  Unlike the 2006 BBC version which was a cross between the vampire movies and Jane Austen, this one stays true to the intent of Bronte's book. Is this the definitive version of Jane Eyre? No, I don't think it is possible for anyone to capture ALL the complexities and intricacies of the book.  However it is a version that deserves watching.

B002N5N5QQ|2.0|Somebody thought he had a great idea: to carry on the torch of amoral, testosterone-fueled series like The Shield or the underground antics glorified in The Sopranos and x-rayed in The Wire, why not a soap opera about a motorcycle gang?<br /><br />What could be more exciting than watching a bunch of bad hombres get drunk, watch porn and start fights? Well ... actually it's not that exciting to watch! Especially when the narrative pacing is closer to tricycle speed than Harley Davidson. These guys spend so much time debating about what they're going to do, and whether they should have a meeting first, that they don't have much time left for actually getting on their bikes. There are also lots of power plays about who gets to be boss, but since their main way of dealing with enemies is making threatening gestures and riding away, they bring more misery on themselves than if they'd simply stayed put drinking beers in the clubhouse.<br /><br />But it's the soap opera aspect of the show that's the most surprising bit. Who'd have guessed that these manly bikers spend so much time hugging and saying stuff like \\"I'm so proud of you!\\" They emote endlessly about whether to tell ... or whether it's best not to for his own good ... and then there's The Book, a legacy of The Founder, which contains wisdom to be passed on to future generations so that The Club May Go On (and The Series Be Renewed). And I won't give away the tear-jerker season closer!<br /><br />The Shield and the Sopranos remain to be dethroned.

0553573403|5.0|I stumbled upon A Game of Thrones in 1997 when I walked by it and saw a quote on the cover from Jordan.  I liked Jordan and was really getting in to the genre so I thought why not.  It is perhaps one of the best random selections of a book/series that I have ever had, and since then am a die hard Martin fan (being one of my top two authors of the genre, the other being Erikson).  I'd recently had the pleasure of re-reading this one because of the HBO series as well as the fact that A Dance With Dragons was coming out.<br /><br />The book does not disappoint, never has.  The second go around, around 14 years after I first read it, was just as special as when I read it the first time.  The characters are so fleshed out and real that you can imagine them existing in real life.  The honorable yet stoic Starks in the North, protecting the realm from an age old, almost mythical threat.  The sinister and greedy Lannisters conniving for power.  The gluttonous King Baratheon who was once a proud and formidable knight.  The homeless Targaryen siblings feeling their way through an alien land yearning to return in triumph.  Let us not forget all the lesser houses and noblemen, the characters that help make Martin's world so colorful and alive.<br /><br />You cannot help but hate Jaime and Cersei, respect Eddard, and admire Tyrion's wit.  And yet despite all of this Martin writes everything in a way that leaves you wondering and doubting about how you feel about them.  He isn't afraid to kill off characters and illustrate political intrigue with a deft hand.  You finish A Game of Thrones shaking your head in anger or pumping your fist.  You finish A Game of Thrones feeling content, and yet you suddenly want to read the next in the series to find out what happens.  Treat yourself to Martin and immerse yourself in the lush, vibrant world.<br /><br />5 stars.<br /><br />PS The only possible downside that some readers suggest is that there are too many characters and that it gets too confusing.  I strongly feel that this style of writing, where each chapter follows a specific character's point of view (rotating through about 7 characters) only makes the narrative that much stronger.at this style of writing, where each chapter follows a specific character's point of view (rotating through about 7 characters) only makes the narrative that much stronger.
0062060554|3.0|I read the entire book, which means that I found it somewhat interesting.  I agree with another reviewer who called it \\"monotonous\\" at times.  It wasn't the most original book, and I didn't identify with any of the characters - so I didn't really sympathize with anyone.    I don't think it is worth the price tag of $12.99.  Maybe $4.99.
0307476154|5.0|I must say that I usually don't like these thrillers, the dime a dozen books that you find being written everywhere.  Your suspense thrillers, detective killer books.

I read all genres, but this is the genre I read the least of, popular fiction.  I couldn't put it down.  I love Lisbeth and Mikael.  The bad guys are over the top, which is what makes them fun.  Lisbeth is almost comically proficient at everything, but I couldn't help but pump my fist or smile when she fights men who weigh twice as much as she does.  I think this is why this book, and series so far, is so captivating.  Larsson touches upon many of the tried and true writing techniques but he does it with finesse.<br /><br />I can't say that this is a favorite of mine, or that I will ever read it again.  For that matter it doesn't rank up there as a book that I will remember years down the road.  But today, and now, when I had a few days to kill, this was the perfect book to pick up and lose myself in.  Give it a go.  A definite recommend.<br /><br />5 stars.

B003UESJEM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly.  It made me angry but that is not a bad thing, it just goes to show how realistic the story is.<br /><br />In 1994, I was \\"outplaced\\" although I was not a company woman.  I was just a lowly technician for a large manufacturing company. I had to laugh at the scenes of the Outplacement services.  I found the whole thing just hilarious (my experience and the ones in the movie).<br /><br />But this movie speaks volumes about the values of our country and how the middle class is treated.  I thought the person who made $150,000 lived in a pretty big fancy house for that salary.  People have lived too high on the hog for too long.  But corporations are still living it up at the expense of those of us who work for a living.<br /><br />I wonder why it did not make first run theaters....maybe it was too close to the truth.
B003CHNP50|5.0|When I first saw the series pilot, I thought, WoW...an edgy, gritty drama about a mild mannered average guy lured into a world of crime by unlucky and heartbreaking circumstance. I presumed it would be a TV series making of the movie \\"Falling Down\\", you know...Good Guy had enough and snapped. How very wrong I was! This drama brings to the screen the vivid reality of human pride and it's rippling effects on the world around us. The character \\"Walt\\" shows us how we can let pride fester within us from losing a love early in his life to another, and allowing it to rationalize the refusal of heartfelt help in a time of need. How pride, unchecked, can cause the death and destruction of countless lives. This series masterfully invites us to take a hard look at ourselves, and asks us, How far will we let our own pride drag us down.

068485743X|5.0|Noah Lukeman's The First Five Pages provides excellent advice for beginning writers, so this book is not for more experienced writers.<br /><br />What I found interesting is that Lukeman addresses the questions of many who attend writers conferences. They ask editors and agents if formatting, spelling, grammar, and noun-verb dense writing are important. The editors and agents politely explain that they are, and I suspect they would just as soon roll their eyes.<br /><br />Moreover, I've read manuscripts that contain such errors, and I wonder if the writers think their ideas or their plots are more important than manuscript etiquette, so I know first-hand that Lukeman addresses problems that shouldn't be.<br /><br />Lukeman does not promise publishing success, nor does he offer advice regarding characterization or plot development that other books do. He simply points out reasons why many manuscripts are rejected. Since publishing houses employ fewer copy editors and proofreaders, Lukeman's advice is particularly appropriate.<br /><br />I believe that The First Five Pages is more useful than many creative writing textbooks that are replete with artificial exercises. Lukeman provides room for writers to write their own stories.

However, virtuously talented musicianship, distinctive heavenly soundscapes with Robert Fripp's signature and in overall an album that should be regarded as one of the highlights of this year when it comes to musical quality that flies high above any defined genre and will definitely trascend... GET IT IN VINYL IN ORDER TO ENJOY THE WHOLE EXPERIENCE!!!!

B004Y1USRG|5.0|As many hard-core YES fans, I too was reluctant to listen to this album and I even passed on a concert they gave here in Mexico City (unforgivable mistake)...  And I must admit, it took only the first sections of the eponymous track for me to fall to the charms of this renewed yet-classical band.  Somewhat reminiscent of the DRAMA era, this album captures the essentials of YES' sound and Benoit David's voice fits perfect in the overall ensemble.  Certainly, I'm still hoping and praying for Jon's return to YES but in all fairness Benoit will certainly not fall short when it comes to adding perfection to an already close-to-perfect prog band.

B004EPYZUI|4.0|I highly recommend this film to basically anyway with half a brain or any taste. It's a big budget, Hollywood \\"art film\\" that was butchered in the theaters to get the coveted MPAA fascist regime's PG-13. On top of that we STILL don't get to see Zack's intended ending surreal musical number, due to the test audiences in the \\"inner city LA\\" thinking it was too weird. If this Blu-Ray sells well, we'll probably see a \\"ULTIMATE DIRECTOR'S CUT\\" coming out with the real ending.
B004XJHBCE|3.0|Hopeful about its promised functionality, I installed Folder Organizer Lite (the free version) a couple of weeks ago. I spent time creating new labels and labeling my apps, but didn't get much further at the time.  Having just installed today's paid version, I was astonished to find that it does not automatically recognize my previous work. I had to export (back up) my existing labels, then import them into the paid app.  Also, I am concerned that this app takes permission to make phone calls without telling me. Why would it need to do that?  I'm giving this app a second chance because of the many favorable reviews. I hope they are for real. And I'll be looking for a way to disable the phone-calling permission.

Also hard to find when you want a video that doesn't have letter-box spaces at the top and bottom of the screen, but fits those of us with older TV's.  This video was exactly what I wanted.  Amazon, by showing pictures of the box cover greatly helps the search.    The puchase was smooth, and delivery fast.

1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Lee Dugard's \\"a stolen life\\" rings with the kind of honesty and truth that make it difficult to describe without resorting to clichés.     Since she was abducted on June 10, 1991 by previously convicted sex offender Phillip Garrido, and finally freed on August 26, 2009, Ms. Dugard has produced a searing journal of her unique experience. In between those two dates, she was forced to bear the daughters Garrido fathered, and held prisoner for longer than probably any other child who has ultimately escaped her kidnappers. Consequently, this story really has the feel of a secret unearthed, and a victory against all odds, when even many of those investigating her case must have wondered if the girl who disappeared so long ago would ever be seen again. As a spokesman for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said, \\"She's alive, and she becomes a symbol of hope for so many searching families.\\"    \\"A stolen life\\" is a harrowing book, but Ms. Dugard makes it bearable and instructive. Part of her considerable skill as a writer comes down to simply knowing what she wants to say in the first place. And while much of her tale is confusing, non-linear, and sometimes even contradictory, in some ways these qualities are more suited to her narrative. As she notes at the beginning, the jumbled nature of her memories and thoughts reflects the disorientation of being held captive for 18 years by a cruel and controlling pedophile.    When Ms. Dugard talks about the sexual abuse she suffered at the hands of Garrido, she is candid but dignified, never shying away from detail where required for context but avoiding any appearance of sensationalism throughout the text. Her bravery in recounting the violent \\"runs,\\" during which Garrido would subject her to extended bouts of drug-fueled sexual molestation, is both heartbreaking in its explicit particulars and a model of decorum all at the same time.    The book has a few flaws, but those are mostly technical. Ms. Dugard commits several unforced grammatical and spelling errors, but even through the occasional tautology (\\"two a.m. in the morning,\\" on p. 111, for instance) she describes her ordeal with clarity, precision and perspective.    And yet Ms. Dugard is unpredictable in her views. Her personality is full of paradoxes. She doesn't take drugs. She doesn't trust cops. She repeatedly calls herself a coward but endures unimaginable pain with a resigned stoicism that would make any soldier proud. She doesn't consider herself religious but wonders about the role that souls play in human relationships. She is understandably angry about the horrors visited upon her, and how they were allowed to happen, but she does not wallow in self-pity or long for vengeance beyond the hope that justice will prevail.    Some reviewers have complained that too much of \\"a stolen life\\" involves accounts of the various cats (and the rare dog or two) the author has known. However, this criticism seems misguided when you realize that - apart from being an animal lover even before she was snatched away from her family - caring for other creatures was an important coping mechanism that helped keep her sane when she had to deal with a degree of loneliness that would have driven a weaker person crazy. Indeed. You don't have to agree with everything Ms. Dugard says to recognize this is memoir of uncommon power and exceptional value that readers will be discussing - and benefiting from - for many years.    And that brings up the need for one last word to the Internet tough guys who blather that Ms. Dugard should have done more to escape, fight or struggle against her tormentors. Take this challenge. Listen to this lady's side of the story and try to explain how you could do better than her, especially when she was a terrified 11-year-old child in a nightmare situation, and then an adult who had to think of how to protect her children, too. Also remember that, for most of her time she was missing, Ms. Dugard was extremely isolated from the rest of the world. As the days turned into weeks, and the months into decades, news of outside events seemed not to penetrate the \\"backyard\\" compound where she did her best to get by and care for her daughters. And if she did hear of the harsh reality that existed outside, the attacks on 9/11, for example, who could blame her if she was scared of the other, unknown dangers lurking elsewhere? Maybe it was easier to dream of a better future and wait until she had the opportunity to ensure that her release would mean safety at last.      Whenever any critic reviews an author's creation, one of the questions he or she must ask is, \\"Was there anything to be learned from this work?\\"    With \\"a stolen life,\\" the answer is a resounding yes. For anybody who has ever felt insignificant, overlooked, or powerless to break out of a trap or find his or her own brand of happiness, that is, most of us, Ms. Dugard's courage is a lesson in perseverance.    In the end, the impression one most gets from reading \\"a stolen life\\" is that of a strong woman who is far more of a survivor than a victim. I can't wait for Ms. Dugard's next book. May she live long and prosper.

1401229921|5.0|This is much more than an \\"Absolute\\" DC version, as it gives you all of Jim Lee's pencil work pre-Colorist.

Won't replace the original, very nice as an addition.
1439107955|5.0|Mukherjee has written a detailed and comprehensive view of cancer, from its earliest written reference (2500 BC in Egypt), through the early attempts at surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, up to the present day, including palliative care, early detection, and avoidance. Mukherjee's writing style is so accessible and understandable, it's hard to believe how much information he gets across. He manages to set a perfect tone - he never minimizes the struggle that so many have faced, and the reader is certainly left with an understanding of the enormity of the task ahead of doctors and scientists, but the reader is also left with the hope that some cancers will be made manageable and others may even be eradicated forever.

1594202842|3.0|I read some scathing reviews of this book, but I guess I had a hard time agreeing with them. Sure, the parenting methods that Amy Chua describes throughout this memoir - yelling at her daughters, not allowing them to attend sleepovers, and generally holding extremely high expectations and punishing the girls when they did not meet those expectations - were unnecessarily harsh in some cases, but I felt like those reviewers missed a few important points. First, Chua obviously wants the best for her children - she just went about it in a different way than most normal American parents would. It may well be that she's correct that many American parents spoil their children, but it's also pretty clear that she realizes that she may have gone overboard in some cases. And, most importantly, she obviously didn't intend for the book to be a parenting manual. In fact, she essentially makes fun of herself throughout the book for being so crazy, and she even admits that her younger daughter outsmarted her and didn't accept her overbearing methods. Worthwhile to know what everyone is talking about - and for some pretty amusing stories - but not recommended as a parenting how-to book.
B00506NRBS|4.0|I'm a Bzzagent and received this book through The Domino Project. The book is a quick read and was able to keep my attention, even though this is not the usual type of subject matter I read.  It is an account of one man's journey of seeing a need for a product, and how he grew that product, and eventually sold it.  He never intended to have his company grow as big as it did, he started it out as a way for him and his buddies to sell their music CD's.  The author goes on to describe his successes and failures through this business venture.  I have not read any other business books to compare it to; however it seemed to have some good basic tips if you are thinking about starting a business.
B004WJREMW|3.0|Sometime Paul McCartney doesn't get the credit he deserves for separating himself from his past. As a Beatle, he all but defined what popular music is to this date. As a solo artist and Wings-man, he reinvented himself as the leader of a band and made a lot of substantial music under that name. And sometimes, he just wanted to do something that was in the way-out-o-sphere. Thirty years later, when you put \\"McCartney II\\" in sequence with albums he's done as \\"Thrillington\\" or \\"The Fireman,\\" there's an experimental streak that becomes clear.<br /><br />\\"McCartney II,\\" originally released in 1980, I remember a Rolling Stone review that was titled \\"McCartney Hits a New Low Again.\\" Granted, this is no \\"Ram\\" or \\"Band On The Run,\\" it's not even \\"Pipes of Peace.\\" However, with the burgeoning new wave movement surrounding him, Paul made the effort to see if he could rein things back and go minimalist. He did the one man band bit, and recorded the whole thing by plugging his mic right into the tape deck. He then proceeded to ape Devo on \\"Temporary Secretary,\\" while \\"Coming Up\\" sounds like he was trying to write a Beatles song for Orchestral Maneuvers in The Dark. \\"One The Way\\" and \\"Nobody Knows\\" tilted towards blues and rockabilly, while the lovely \\"Waterfalls\\" and \\"One Of These Days\\" are the kind of earnest ballads it seems Paul can toss off in an afternoon.<br /><br />What is telling is how much of \\"McCartney II\\" is devoted to electronic instrumentals. \\"Front Parlour,\\" \\"Summer's Day Song\\" and \\"Frozen J**\\" could easily be from his Fireman persona that he debuted in 1994. I don't think that these are the songs any McCartney fan would have in a heavy rotation, but they did show that, after years of being a rock idol, he was willing to go way outside his comfort zone. That still doesn't excuse \\"Bogey Music\\" and \\"Darkroom\\" or the album's overall this sound. The remaster does help a bit with that issue, though.<br /><br />The bonus disc is a worthy addition, as it includes the USA hit version of \\"Coming Up (Live at Glasgow)\\" the considerably improves the song's qualities. Both \\"Blue Sway\\" and \\"Secret Friend\\" could have easily been a part of the original album without affecting its sound. The Christmas tune \\"Wonderful Chritsmastime\\" makes another appearance on CD, which is OK for those that haven't heard it enough already. The rest are experiments and songs that were left off for good reason. All together, not worth the scorn heaped on it when originally released. Makes me eager for coming reissues.Up (Live at Glasgow)\\" the considerably improves the song's qualities.

B004WKOCP8|4.0|I know that a lot of people are disappointed in \\"If Not Now, When?\\" and that's understandable because it is unlike anything Incubus has done to date. However, if you keep up with Incubus you would have known that something different was what they were going for and because of that I think they were able to create something very beautiful. I love this new album. It's very chill and I've been listening to it everyday. I love \\"Promises, Promises\\", \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" and \\"Thieves\\" this is the first album of theirs where I actually find myself in love with the title track as well. It has been a long time since they're released a new full length album and it was worth the wait. I can't wait to see them here in Chicago in August!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|The Schrade SCHF9 Extreme Survival Knife is what I would describe as a \\"hidden gem\\" among very few, true bargains (Asterisk and underlined) in the category of survival knives on the market (Please don't bombard me with rants or lists of personal choices and preferences - this is MY opinion).<br /><br />For those of you who like to do their own research on Amazon, YouTube, gear publications and some of the many blogs that help guide shoppers to a good survival knife; then you have developed an eye for detail, a filter for buzzwords and gained knowledge of trends that have come and gone. If superior products (Read the specs!) and saving money appeals to you - then your search may be over! Sure, there are many choices out there, but do your homework and you will see the benefits of a knife that is under $40.00 and one that will last you for years in the field! Years...? Yeah, years. This is one tough, hef-ty blade.<br /><br />Bottomline? GET IT - you won't be disappointed.
0553801473|4.0|Probably not the best in the series, but that's hardly s detraction since the series as a whole is so good. It's a bit plodding at first with two many similar narrators, too much traveling and too much talk of rape, but there is a lot of satisfying and surprising character growth. Watch out for the Reek storyline, it's intense.

B003Y5H542|5.0|The animation is top notch, very well done by paramount.  The story is a bit predictable but keeps up a good pace. The film is no more vulgar than anything else on the tele so those complaining that its not a kids film must be ultra conservatives. I watched it with my 8 year old daughter and we both loved it! Perfect for adults and children. What else can I say but R.I.P Hunter S. Thompson.
B004NS710C|5.0|What more is there to say, but, \\"Yea!\\" Denzel is fabulous as usual in this exciting movie. Enough suspense to keep you interested with individual story lines to keep you engaged. From restraining orders and corporate BS to blue collar smarts and heroism, Unstoppable is definitely a treat to watch. There is a balance between not to complicated and simplistic that makes this a success. I'm certainly glad this is one of the ones I choose to watch On Demand.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I was thrilled when I watch it the first time!    This anime tells a great story based off our own world-society as a widely known and used operating system/social media is affected by an unknown user, throwing the entire world into total chaos. Family meetings, feuds, love, hate, different people joined together in an adventure of a lifetime, all under a single roof. Many compare it with famed series Digimon, but this is how Digimon should have been.    On a deeper note, it reflects mankind's almost total dependence on the virtual world on all matters, from online shopping, social sites to managing people's health, lifestyle and even further, managing proper order in cities and countries and their governments. This movie shows how fragile our real life infrastructure, dependent mostly on computers can really be. But it also shows that with determination, anything can be resolved, from family matters to world crisis, of course, determination en masse.    Movie is longer than an hour and a half, and the climax towards the ending is only matched by, say, mission impossible, but with a different twist!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|As a new band the xx stand out from the rest. This album is simply beautiful. Lyrically it's simple but perfect, and musically the xx has created a sound that is unique and groundbreaking. There is no album I can more highly recommend.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Even beating one of my favorite bands, Radiohead, this is the best album of 2011 so far. I've listened to this so much, I know every word of every song when it comes on, and I didn't even try to. Helena Beat is amazing, Pumped Up Kicks is their magnum opus so far, Call it What You Want is so much fun (I heard it in Hollister yesterday, and tried not to scream), Color on the Walls reminds me even more of fun. Waste is probably my favorite song on tthe album. And the rest is still so good, and I bought it not knowing it would be this good! This album is highly recommended.

1594744769|5.0|The top few reviews for this book hit a lot of the main points right on the head.  This book is a wonderful introduction into a world where you can get swept away.  I see this series becoming just as popular as the Harry Potter books.  I read the first three chapters on-line and absolutely had to get the book.  When I did get it I finished it that same day, which isn't a normal occurrence for me.  I simply could not put this book down once I started to read it!  Ransom Riggs has a firecracker of a story on his hands and I can't wait to see what's next in book two.  This is a series that would translate easily into a comic book, movie or TV series if done right.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|My problem is with the labeling.  The only way you can tell which disc is which is by the teeny, tiny lettering on the outer edge of each disc.  I don't know whose brilliant idea it was to not clearly label these discs but it was a really stupid idea.  Other than that, this is a great set and a must own for any fan.    UPDATE: I posted that review before I read the others and got through all of the discs (Only watched the first 3).  Seems I too have the Spanish version and I would agree that some of them are less than stellar quality.  In addition, no Green Lantern ticket.  I feel very, very cheated by Amazon and sincerely hope they rectify this situation ASAP and allow all of us who've been deceived to get the proper versions at that price.    UPDATE PART 2: Amazon came through and quickly set my up for a return.  Granted, it will take 4 weeks for me to get my money back, but to their credit, they realized their mistake and corrected it.  In addition, they informed me that they don't have the correct one ins stock at the moment and that's no fault of theirs.  My rating is not for them, it's for the item.  Since the item advertised is not the item sent, I am retaining the 1-star rating.  Until it's corrected, I will keep it that way.  I bit the bullet and went to Best Buy and bought the thing for full price (it's my cross to bear, so don't give me a hard time).  If you order this and end up with the version where a) the inner box slides in the SIDE of its outer box (as opposed to the top, with a cool lid) and b) the disc are clearly label in English, you got the Spanish (i.e., WRONG) item.  Return it.
B004289ZW0|1.0|* I am an ex-pat Helicopter Pilot visiting the USA from my residence in the UAE - for approved further training. As I had very little time, I read all the reviews here and elsewhere and so purchased both one of these units and a Black-Elf.    Delivery of the items was to a friend with whom I stayed in NY.    * On arrival, I checked both items against the software being used on my iPAd 2 - Foreflight, WingX Pro, Topo Maps, Air Nav Pro - and whilst the Black Elf worked straight out of the box (after downloading some small connectivity default-required software) - this unit was TOTALLY spastic and NEVER, EVER functioned.    * The Slide On/Off switch is a peripatetic JOKE and works once in 10... USELESS.    * Connecting it both to the iPad and to my spare iPhone 4 - alternately - I walked down from E37th Street - in the open - to Brooklyn Bridge and half way across the Hudson River. This idiot unit just kept blinking and NEVER picked up any Satellite signal AT ALL - whereas the Black Elf tracked perfectly - and accurately to within 30 m most of the time - whilst in the open - and 100 m on the return walk through the skyscrapers along 5th Avenue.    * The ONLY saving grace (as far as I am concerned) is that AMAZON - and their \\"Chat Function\\" - helped me very speedily arrange a return and refund of the unit - even though I didn't still have the packaging.    * No - I would DEFINITELY NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNIT - despite it being both more practical, elegantly attractive and less prone to disconnection than the Black Elf with its propensity to cause some stress on the connector.    OK - granted - more than likely I had a duff unit and other purchaser's experiences have been, as I see, both positive and complimentary - though the On / Off switch - it would appear - also causes similar reticences.    However, THAT is not the point: a GOOD, well tried and carefully conceived unit - especially one on which Pilots are supposed to be able to rely as a back-up - should not attract ANY appreciable, and consistently neagtive degree of criticism.    This \\"thing\\" does - just read the reviews. ... And THAT can't make for a generically positive kind of impression...    * (... I ONLY give it ONE Star because that is the necessary minimum required default-value possible... Otherwise it wouldn't even rate ANY at all...)      * TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT

B003UESJH4|5.0|First off I do love period pieces so you would think this would be right up my alley.  Alas, it's the period before the 1900's that I love so much but to be truthful now I found this movie quite amazing.  The actors were spectular with their roles and I can only imagine how hard it must have been to studder throughout most of the filming.<br /><br />This movie takes place during the current Queen Elizabeth's childhood and deals mostly with her father and somewhat with her grandfather and uncle.  King George VI and his Queen must have been a gloreous pair and you can truly see it was a love match with the way they act together and care for each other.  Their strength combined is what helped King George VI during a most trying time in a position he desperately did not want but accepted with the courage and finasse' that comes with the breeding and education of someone of his status.<br /><br />I really cannot say enough about the King's Speech and it really is not something you should miss.  It portray's the royals as people also, they come with problems, doubts, fears and an amazing array of emotions that the rest of us carry.  This is one period piece I will watch many more times to come.
B0041CGP02|4.0|While I really like Bon Jovi's music (and always have), I have a hard time calling this \\"Ultimate\\".  There are a lot of great tracks on here like \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" and \\"It's My Life\\".  But can anyone explain how \\"Never Say Goodbye\\" from the 1987 Slippery When Wet LP got left off of both this compilation and the 1994 \\"Cross Roads\\" cd?  \\"Crossroads\\" was a full collection of hits from Bon Jovi.  I would have swapped out the \\"Prayer '94\\" for \\"Never Say Goodbye\\".    That being said, each of these discs could have a few more songs on each one.  I would have liked to see \\"In These Arms\\", \\"Edge of A Broken Heart\\", and of course \\"Never Say Goodbye\\".      I like this compilation, but it's still missing a few pieces.
B000040OBS|5.0|Suicide debut album is perhaps one of the very unique albums to ever be made. Historically, it arrived after the sheer experimental music landscape of the late 60s' and before the new wave/synth pop explosion of the 80s'. Culturally it lies somewhere between the aggression of low class youth and the iconoclasm of the artistic cliques; and those are just remotely similar to the output of Vega & Rev. Musically its somewhere in the middle of a triangle of musical genres; on one angle lies Electronica, on the other one Pop and on the other one Rock (punk rock most likely).<br /><br />Yet despite being an utterly unique album, a variety of musical genres that dominated the next decade, from post punk to dance, owed to Suicide for being the proto-pioneers of these trends. And it is evident by listening to the material that so many genres come to mind. True, it is an experimental album on the surface, but only in a vague sense of the word; its not musically a bin of noise or a rhythmically irregular work as those of their contemporaries Throbbing Gristle. It does have experimental elements; the vocal range from whispery to cacophonies of screams, as well as the minimalist melodies of the cheap synthesizers. Outside those elements the songs are full fledged compositions just as mainstream music, but heavily processed as into raw synthesized melodies and eery vocal deliveries. This is what makes the individual songs, from the satirical \\"Ghost Rider\\" to the ominous pseudo-harmonies of \\"Keep Your Dreams\\", work as single, powerful works of their own.<br /><br />Suicide was a product of many sorts and their intense debut album shows it. Influences as the likes of Krautrock contemporaries such as Can, and hard edge proto punk figures such as The Velvet Underground and The Stooges come to mind. This only adds to their cultural mystique; the duo were aggressive personalities far and out from the status quo, culturally placed between American outcasts and underground, Europe-flavored artistic mentalities, and this can be appreciated in the lyrical content of the album. Despite being so different and unique, the band's first two albums spawned a generation of fashionable cliques in music over the next decade. Beautifully ironic.alities, and this can be appreciated in the lyrical content of the album.

0553801473|5.0|I find it amazing that some are criticizing George's fifth book.  So let me guess those who expected answers are dumb struck that Martin didn't settle those unresolved questions?  I find this laughable, George never said anywhere that book five would end the saga...In fact he said it would build on the saga and open some new questions...If you want a short read, maybe you should walk on down to your nearest library and rent out some children's books?<br /><br />I thought book 5 was superb.  Yes, it opened up some new questions.  And yes it left me yearning for book six.<br /><br />My guess is that Martin concludes the saga by book 10.  He has already said numerous times, he doesn't want his series to end like the \\"Wheel of Time\\".  Give the guy a break he is a literary genius.
1451629184|1.0|I thought I would find out more than I had known from the tv special that aired recently. That is not the case. The book is detailed enough to make you want to throw up a times - thinking about what he did to an 11 year old girl but it's still not well written by any means. She never talks about trying to find a way out or escape.....which bothers me even more! I know that no matter what I would fight to the death to have my freedom from some sick demented pervert who wanted to constantly rape me. I understand survival but this is insanity.<br /><br />If you want to comment on my review please feel free. I don't care what you say. I STICK BY IT.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I bought this when the stock Android system only had 3 home screens because some reviewer mentioned that we should stop whining about the # of screens and get Folderorganizer.  It works.  It's reliable.  Each update makes it better vs many of the apps that I paid for (to help support a struggling programmer) that eventually collapsed under their own weight.<br />Great program, everyone should download this.  It works with ALL roms.<br />Amazon has to come up with a way to filter out the trolls that complain about the one app per week that is for grown-ups.  Anyone that has used this app would know that the 5 star reviews are NOT the developer.  If you only want games, then only download games, stop being a troll, you ruin it for everyone.  The permission to monitor the phone is not because it wants to make a call, it is so it can jump out of the way when there is an incoming call.<br />Ignore the trolls, the little-kid gamers, the conspiracists, and even the genuinely concerned permission people.  This is a great app that you will use every day.  Is that 20 word minimum hit yet?
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Season 6 of Greys is just as fresh as the previous seasons. This show has never become tired, the dramas less involving, the characters less engaging,  than the first season, and I admit to having difficulty showing restraint in not watching each episode as its shown on TV. I prefer watching my Greys in nightly episodes, totally commercial free, from the comfort of my bed - self-prescribed dosage of one episode per night. I already have Season 7 on order, not yet available here in Australia.

Being a vegetarian, I get lots of inspiration from this book, and you see the list of vegetable ingredients, the beautifully shot photographs, and your mouth just waters.    This is a must for vegetarians and carnivores alike.    The list of ingredients for some of the recipes looks frightening, and I have had to find shops that supply some of the lesser common ingredients.

B003QNXPUK|2.0|The ZAGG invisible Shield for the iPhone 4 comes with the front, back, and side films. The ZAGG does what its suppose to do, which is protect your iPhone from scratches and dings. The material feels strong and sturdy, it doesn't feel like a cheap plastic like others. However, it does not last very long. The ZAGG was on my iPhone for less a few months and the back film started to peel. The edges wouldn't stick anymore and eventually it completely peeled off. So I had to buy an actual case for the phone. About a month or two later, some edges of the front film started to peel also. As of today, the front film is still on, but there's ripples around the edges.    Overall, the material is good, but the durability sucks. I guess you could just get a replacement or something, because there is some sort of warranty on this through the company, but I didn't want to bother with the hassle. Also FYI, if you plan on putting a back/side case on your iPhone, don't put the side films on because it will make the sides to bulky and your case might not fit.
B0000256KE|5.0|I won't lie. I like the cut of this bands jib. From the moment I started listening to them they engendered a very individual opinion. Also when you hear them from an album AS individual as [[ASIN:B0000256KG Roxy Music]] you have to deal with the fact that this is one of those bands who will not make the same exact album over again and again. The potential to grow was part of their concept and it continued with this album. Yes so this was their final outing with Brian Eno as a member-didn't seem he and Ferry could be in the same band together without something of a matter/anti-matter reaction occuring. But in a way that's what distinguishes this album from the previous. The debut deals with a lot of implied eccentricity. Here it's right in your face. Not just in terms of lyrics but also by the fact the music,both in tempo and instrumental sound is intensely powerful. And in terms of how the band handles a melody....well that's undergoing a change too.<br /><br />  After a debut that handles each song more as part of a piece than singular pieces with seperate personalities,each one of these songs is more like a little journey all it's own. Even if they hold together as seamlessly as those on the debut did. \\"Do The Strand\\",\\"Editions Of You\\" and \\"The Bogus Man\\" are all quite a lot heavier on the rock end of things than the previous albums. Even with the presense of heavily wah-wah reverbed guitars,bassess,keyboards along with other musical effects,the the rock and roll \\"heart is in the beat\\" and it's there for sure. The quirkiness comes more compositionally than musically here. That's especially true for the sparer ballad type numbers \\"Beauty Queen\\" and \\"Strictly Confidential\\". The somewhat gospel/soul inflected \\"Grey Lagoons\\" is actually close to being a full on pop song. So would the closing title song....if it weren't for that abstract fusion instrumental second half of this 9+ minute song.<br /><br />  \\"In Every Dream Home A Heartache\\" pulls all of it together,musically and conceptually. Is Ferry taking about the decedance of wealth?Fetishism?An inflatable doll? ALL of them? By tying all the musical themes presented on this album into one song actully keeps it's lyrics from coming too much in to focus,much to my surprise. And that's the one thing about this album that's important to understand. It's individual songs coming together to CREATE a whole rather than the other way arund. That goes for the music and lyrics as well. That to some degree brings it just a hair closer to pop. But Roxy Music wouldn't exactly get to that for a long while to come. The ideas here are stil thoroughly based in some form of controlled chaos. Okay so the music is challanging. It is different. But somehow it's also extremely inviting and ammusing even. And how much music can we,in all honesty say that about?me A Heartache\\" pulls all of it together,musically and conceptually.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|It's a great app.  The reason the trolls rate it with 1 star is because other people rate it with 5 stars.  How ignorant is that?  Oh, if it's a good app that people are reviewing high, those reviews must be fake, because these trolls know it all.    I've used the predecessor (Apps Organizer) of this app for the past 11 months and I jumped at the chance to get FolderOrganizer today for free--I couldn't believed my eyes when I first saw it on the Amazon FAOTD webpage. FolderOrganizer has been available on the Android Market for about a year.  (FYI: Apps Organizer works the same way, but is for apps only--it has no contacts, no shortcuts, no bookmarks, no subfolders, etc.  Luckily, you can export the app configurations from Apps Organizer to FolderOrganizer.)  I spent an hour or so setting it up and playing around with it and it works perfectly.  Like I said, it's a great app.  Everything on my phone is now nice and neat and organized exactly how I want it.    Yes, Android already does have the concept of folders, but they are those ugly generic folder icons.  And if you have multiple Android folders on your homepages, they all look the same.  With FolderOrganizer you can customize the folder icons via several sources.  Plus, Android folders only go one level deep.  You can have as many subfolder levels as you want with FolderOrganizer.    My friends with iPhones have told me they are actually jealous--they can only go back and forth with their icons--they think the iPhone UI is boring.  Androids can go right and left, up and down, and, with this app, down sub-levels.    Oh wait, I rated this app with 5 stars, so this must be a fake review too.  Of course, I've rated a few other things here on Amazon, so that must mean the developers must have faked those reviews too.  I checked out some of the other people giving 5 star rated reviews--most have posted reviews on other items as well.  I guess the developers must have set up all those fake people and added their otherfake reviews too--just to look good.  Yeah right!  You trolls need to move out of your parent's basement!

0553801473|3.0|I love the Song of Ice and Fire series, though A Feast for Crows suffered from \\"Robert Jordan Syndrome\\" - in other words, splitting the narrative into too many viewpoint characters meant that the pacing of the plot slowed to a crawl. So much so that this book is really the second half of A Feast For Crows.<br /><br />This book is better. The writing is engaging (Tyrion is hilarious as hell in this book, even when being emo) and I care more about the characters in this book than in the other.<br /><br />Buuuuuttttt... the plot goes nowhere. GRRM sets up a wonderful predicament for Daenerys in her conquered city. In fact, it is the main plotline of the book. And yet... everything is exactly as it was at the start of the book. The plot doesn't advance.<br /><br />In fact, if you picture the world as a chessboard, between the beginning and the end of the book, only a few pieces have moved. A couple have been removed, a couple have been added, but for all of the extreme length of the book, nothing really happens.<br /><br />It's a shame really, since it was actually a very enjoyable read, much more so than A Feast For Crows. Except for a couple wonderful (and horrible) plot twists, you could easily skip this book, read a one-page summary, and wait for The Winds of Winter.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|This is one addictive listen. I haven't repeat listened to anything so much in years (not even their first album, and that is saying something) when this was released back in April '07 it seemed as though the band were unstoppable.<br /><br />This album was a huge step forward that I'll bet alot of people didn't expect from the band. Far from cracking under the pressure the Arctic Monkeys had delivered one hell of a strong album, an effort to be proud of. Upon its release it was heaped with praise, won many awards and the world thought very positive thoughts about the band.<br /><br />Songs like `Teddy Picker,' and `Balaclava,' gave listeners what they'd came to expect from the band, with jaunty riffs, brash chords and their unique brand of lyrical genius while songs like `Only Ones Who Know,' displayed the melancholy ballad style as previously heard on tracks like `No Buses,' or `Riot Van.' Its basically still the early Arctic Monkeys sound, but executed and produced much better, a mature and professional version of the raw and lovable debut.<br /><br />A special mention is also in order for drummer Matt Helders who's skill had improved exponentially, impressive considering most people would already say he's the most talented member. The fills on this record are awesome, and his technical disco meets rock swagger style fits the album very well.<br /><br />The stand out songs are the energetic `This House is a Circus,' the chilled out '505,' and the aforementioned `Teddy Picker.'<br /><br />The band may have lost some of their public appeal now, having released more complicated and difficult work since but fans shouldn't forget the feelings these songs inspired at the time of release. Furthermore; If you haven't already, you should pick up a copy of this album right away, it is one of the finest records in the genre.

B002LCCNW8|4.0|Arctic Monkey's threw the world a surprising curve ball with their third studio album Humbug, changing their musical direction quite considerably and releasing an album of complicating, challenging music that bore little resemblance to the fun and easy going style of their debut.<br /><br />The music started to incorporate both psychedelic influences and desert/stoner rock influences, which, while not overwhelming the album certainly left the overall impression as something different and odd. It hasn't become a Sleep album or a Down album all of a sudden, but you can hear twinges of that style here and there. Josh Homme of Kyuss/QOTSA fame co-produced the album and guest featured on four tracks, which should give you some indication of the direction the album took.<br /><br />At first, I did not care for the changes one bit, I thought they should have had more fun lyrics, more fast songs and less jarring time sig/tempo changes, many fans did in fact, given the backlash against this album.<br /><br />The album really grew on me however and now I'd rate it very highly indeed. The material just as an enjoyably hypnotic quality, and there is much to like about the album.<br /><br />Standout tracks include the opener `My Propeller,' the oft-played-in-concert number `Pretty Visitors,' and `Secret Door,' which I think most bridges the old and new styles.<br /><br />Overall, many people may be put off by Humbug, but if you enjoy a bit of prog or stoner rock then you may find that this album grows on you after a while.<br />Comment

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|You can't help but admire Jaycee Dugard, who survived not only abuse but piercing isolation for 18 years.  How she survived mentally as well as physically is impressive.   As a story of human courage and adaptation, it's a breathtaking story.  It is, more than anything else, about loneliness, and what being lonely does to the human spirit.    It's not well-written, though.  That's probably too much to expect--Dugard isn't a professional writer, and because of her kidnapping, she's not trained.   I tip my hat to her that she writes as well as she does (which is better than most people!).  But the book is often slanted in strange and maudlin ways.   The pages and pages about her kitten are probably more than most of us want to read.  I would have liked to hear more about her daughters, and what they made of their confinement, and less about Dugard's pets.      I know lots of people love that it's a feel-good story.   But honestly, I think the Oprah-style play to the emotions is really forced.  Whether that comes from the editors or her publicist, it feels strangely disrespectful of what she endured to pretend that it has all ended up making her stronger and better, yada yada yada.  As I was reading it, I thought of the scene in Emma Donaghue's \\"Room\\" when the main character, who had been kidnapped, blew up at the TV host for asking \\"are you stronger at the broken places\\"?   This isn't a feel-good story.   It's a horrifying story of depravity, pain, and loss.  Why cheapen it by tacking on a cheesy moral?  Why not let it stand for what it is, and let readers feel it for what it is?
B002JTHFV2|5.0|Of all the things that can be said about the re-issue of this album, the most important is the listening experience.<br /><br />If you own any of the previous releases of The Unforgettable Fire, you'll know that experimentally and sonically, this is one of U2's best albums hands down, but for whatever the recording restrictions that existed were at the time, the album, CD, cassette, mp3, radio-play ... or however you heard it, always made your brain want to reach in and adjust it.<br /><br />Apparently U2 felt the same way and a lot of work has been done to enhance every aspect of this album to the listening glory that it deserves. It no longer sounds 'flattened' so to speak, but very dynamic. You can actually pick out Adam's bass-lines  much easier without straining and Bono's voice has also been 'opened' up, clarity wise, to a much wider experience.<br /><br />I spent a lot of time in the eighties listening to this on cassette, delivered via the beauty of a personal Walkman device. Yeah, I could've said Sony, but I've purchased so many non-Sony's over the years that it's just not fair to single them out even though they opened the door. I drove many miles in the car while this was on, putting me in a trance sending my imagination elsewhere, often to some girl or some place long gone. I have nothing but good memories with this album and I'm very happy with the end result of the remastering process of this album. Just beautiful.

1594202842|3.0|Part memoir, part dyspeptic Dr. Spock, Amy Chua sparked quite a \\"national conversation\\" with this book and its pre-publication PR.  Having the right cultural background and liberal creds, Ms. Chua is able to engender discussion where others would have found opprobrium.  That being said, the book would likely have been less successful if not for the resonance of some of her points (irrespective of her child-rearing methods).  The one constant throughout the book is her criticism of American (Occidental) parenting.  I'm using Occidental in this sense to mean American parents who are not of Asian, especially Far-East Asian, descent.  One of the initial issues one encounters with the book is her lack of specificity.  Does she really mean that all Asians parent in this way?  Does this style of parenting cross geographical, cultural and class boundaries?  This problem is compounded by side-stepping the nature/nurture question early on in the book.  Someone in her social circle who wants to stay there simply must say, albeit briefly, that tiger mothers can be of any lineage and the results will be equally fantastic.  Of course, one gets the sense that she doesn't entirely accept the blank slate hypothesis that represents conventional wisdom among her peers.  Towards the end of the book, she speaks of several frustrating weeks attempting to train a seemingly obstinate dog.  After doing some research and finding the canine to not be among the more intelligent breeds, she relaxes and accepts the dog for what it is.  Although she claims the dog is not a metaphor, it's difficult to explain the inclusion of the dog training vignette if it isn't.  The fact is that Chua's father is a UC Berkley Electrical Engineering Professor and she's a graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School.  Her husband is Jewish and a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School.  Is it possible that genetics could play a role in the success of her daughters?  She certainly won't admit it, but I suspect she realizes that there's a strong likelihood of its possibility.  There are some other points that it would have been helpful for her to address.  For example, the occidental parenting that she loathes is of a more recent vintage.  Helicopter parenting, the belief that one's child is an excellent student and that a lesser grade is the teacher's failing, etc., are additional gifts bequeathed to us by the baby boom generation.  Just a couple of generations ago, many parents would have been more likely to push their children to work harder and study more in the face of lagging grades.  This isn't to say that Ms. Chua's strict standards were ever the norm in the U.S., but strong, responsible families were certainly in greater supply.  The author also fails to deal adequately with the negative aspects of her style of parenting.  Clearly it doesn't work on all Asian children; her father and youngest daughter are testaments to this.  More importantly, are there externalities associated with raising children in such a strict, regimented way?  Mainland China has been locked in Communist rule for well over 60 years.  Tens of millions have lost their lives at the hands of, or as a result of, the government.  Yet throughout it all, very little in the way of rebellion has occurred on Chinese soil (Tiananmen Square protests being a notable exception).  Perhaps the rigidity she advocates produces well-mannered, well-educated conformists.  I don't know and she never explores the idea.  Finally, the impact of her parenting on her husband is dealt with only infrequently and obliquely.  Her husband does not seem to be fully on board with all of her methods, but they keep their disagreements hidden from their children.  While a united front may spare the children additional strife and conflicting signals, it doesn't resolve the underlying divergence of opinion that exists between the married couple.  I certainly won't defend the sorry state that parenting has devolved into in the United States over the course of the past 45+ years, but as I think Ms. Chua came to realize, her ways aren't always effective either.  Battle Hymn is an interesting read and a quick one at that.  I do think it suffers from, among other things, a lack of focus.  I'm not entirely sure of the author's intent for the book: memoir, prescription, proscription, income source for music supplies???  If you're looking for a positive lesson in how to raise your child, this isn't the book for you. Surprisingly, despite some of her negativity and tone, you come away less with a poor impression of the author than with a desire to discuss/debate what you've read and there's something to be said for that.
1907410716|4.0|I decided to read this because even though I'm almost 30yrs old I got sucked into the TV show on ABC Family. The show just finished its first season and during the downtime I figured I'd read the series of books to see if I could figure out who \\"A\\" actually is! haha.<br /><br />I'm actually quite surprised at the book. I expected it to be very young adult, and what I got was a young adult novel filled with drinking, smoking, swearing, and sex. Not that that is a bad thing at my age haha, but I figured this was aimed at 12-15 year old girls, but I guess I was wrong.<br /><br />While the book isn't anything mind blowing, its a very quick read and I did enjoy it. I was surprised at how well it followed the tv show. Only a few differences (from what I can recall). I'm looking forward to the next book, and the next season of the show.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|Bought this a month ago. takes a little setup time, but works much better than dropping folders on the home screen. I like the higher density options, and like the notification to add new downloads to a folder.  Oops, gave this 5 stars - must be a fake review, right?

B003Y5H542|4.0|Yes, it is somewhat derivative - the \\"Spirit of the West\\" is obviously an homage Clint Eastwood. Noticed that the \\"Beans\\" character looks unsettlingly like the 'baby' in \\"Eraserhead\\". The biggest nod is to \\"Chinatown\\",  with which \\"Rango\\" ultimately shares a very similar plot (Dirt's mayor and John Huston's character in \\"Chinatown\\" look alike, sound alike, and even share some lines).<br /><br />Still, \\"Rango\\" entertains from start to finish, and belongs in any computer animation fan's library. Just stunning visuals - fur/hair textures that were very difficult to achieve in films as recent as \\"Monsters, Inc.\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" abound in \\"Rango\\", and seem to be effortless at this point.<br /><br />There's just so much to absorb in this film, it's worth multiple viewnings.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I loved this movie and all the points it hit, i am the most stuborn and ignorant person when it comes to \\"organic\\" but after watching this movie, it has really changed my outlook on what i am going to be eating and why i will change what im eating. I have always said that its no different and they just put organic on there to make it look good, but boy was i wrong....i am extremely happy i watched this and would recommend this to anyone, especially the ones that are like me and dont think this chicken is better than that one.
B004LWZW24|2.0|Worth a rental, no way you're paying moviegoer fare for this.     Starts off well enough, using the ole' less is more formula of haunted houses, but that's the essence of fright - letting the audience scare itself by leaving out concrete details such as the true appearance of ghosts/demons. Paranormal Activity used the less is more formula to great effect. Amazing how scared you can get on a budget flick.    Anyway, Insid builds it up but lets it down in the end, where the film just implodes, turns on itself and removes any sense of fright created so clearly in the start and middle.    The most frightening film since The Exorcist? Demon, please.    The most terrifying film since Poltergeist? Shame on you, promoter-voice guy.    A two-star one-night rental to enjoy and forget? Right on, daddy-o.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've been using the light version of this app for almost as long as I've had my phone. Those one star reviewers obviously never explored the normal Android market for this type of organization app (of which there are only a small handful that are this powerful), otherwise they'd know this app has existed for a long time.  Ecellent app. It has a bit of a learning curve. I had to go to the dev's website to really learn how to use it, which might earn it 4 stars from some reviewers, but I give it 5, because once I learned it, this app has been a dream for organizing my phone exactly the way I want.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Hola, acabo de recibir este excelente Box Set  Lo espere por mucho tiempo, y por fin puedo decir que tengo la discografia completa de los 04 grandes de Liverpool  En relación al diseño y la parte externa, es estupendo, las fotografías, el booklet es impresionante.  En cuanto a la musica misma, puedo decir que si bien el sonido Stereo te da la sensación de estar cerca o en frente de la banda, me parece que en algunas canciones se sobrepasaron de separar los canales, osea hay temas donde el Stereo es fascinante pero en otros, prefiero el Mono, pues al separar los canales de audio, se siente como muy extremos los sonidos de la voz y el audio por otro lado,.. creo que hubo un cierto grade de no exactitud por parte de los remasterizadores.   Hay canciones de los Beatles que son fascinantes en Stereo pero no todos,.... en otras el Mono es recomendable.  En fin, disfruten de este excelente Box Set

0385732554|5.0|This well-crafted novel purports to be a young reader's novel, but I cannot imagine children or even teenagers getting as much meaning out of it as an adult.  This is unequivocally one of the best pieces of literature of the 20th century.  This novel constantly challenges the reader to adjust his perception of what is real and what is right.  It is definitely a page-turner, full of unexpected twists that force you to readjust the way you interpret circumstances.  The underlying issues --- gritty and complex as they are --- invite, in fact compel, further thought.  Deep thought.  I wanted to talk about this book, as I was reading it and afterwards.  That, to me, is the signature of a classic; it makes me think during and well beyond the course of my reading.  It might even impact my life.  I highly recommend this book for all ages. If you read it in middle school, reread it now.  As an adult, you will appreciate it on a whole different level.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|When it comes to Lady Gaga : everyone exagerates. Firstly her with her outrageous outfits and attitudes, secondly her fans who worship her so much it becomes almost impossible to critize her and of course her haters who seem to have no limits at trying to trash her and ruin her reputation ignoring constantly that she is, no matter what they might say, an innovative artist and a pretty good singer.    Because no matter what people think about her, they can't deny that she has a voice, and what a voice. Sadly, it's often obstructed behind all the electronica and hype but on songs like Marry the night, The edge of glory or You and I, it's pretty obvious.    And when this album was released a few months ago, everyone's reactions to it were over the top as well to say the least so I think it's time to set the record straight.    No, this album is certainly not the album of the decade as she claimed months before its release but it's a good album nevertheless.     She doesn't innovates a lot in here, but in some songs, she did (Americano : daring to mix mexican mariachi with modern techno : who would have ever thought of doing that ?!, Government Hooker : a great modern rhythm like you don't often hear them in pop music, Sheisse : well, this track is strange I know, but it's so much fun !).     What bothers me the most about this album is that a lot of tracks are reminders of ancient Madonna songs, she even tries (and succeed quite well as a matter of fact) to emulate her voice on songs like Bloody Mary or Electric Chapel.    And like in all her previous albums, her influences are quite obvious as well (a little bit of Madonna here, some Cyndi Lauper there, Spagna, Whitney Houston etc...) but this results in a melting pot album where everyone (and I mean everyone) will always find a track to love, even though it doesn't help making this album as cohesive as The Fame Monster was but it makes it a very entertaining and joyful experience that's for sure.    But this album isvery different from her previous album The Fame Monster. Monster was a very short album (only 8 tracks) but almost all of them were great. Here there are (in the Deluxe edition which I bought at least) 16 tracks and the problem is that inside you can find very good tracks and some awful ones as well, let's be honest.    On the plus side you have songs that could have been great singles (Marry the night, Hair, Sheisse...), what have already been singles (Born this way, Judas) but on the downside there are a lot of fillers as well which I can't seem to warm up to, no matter how hard I try (Highway unicorn, Americano, Heavy metal lover...).    And finally you have also tracks like Electric Chapel who could have been even greater if they had a proper chorus for instance because the guitar in there is great but it doesn't remplace a good chorus in what could have been another smash hit that had the potential of rocking the charts madly otherwise (too bad this experiment failed but not by much really).    But in the end, it's still one of the greatest (if not the greatest) album(s) released this year. And even though it's not the album of the decade, I'm sure about one thing : it certainly paves the way for an even greater album to come. I have faith in Lady Gaga for the future and I'm certain that we're not still done with her yet.
0316069353|2.0|Michael, Michael, Michael....<br /><br />I can't believe I'm giving a one of your books a 2 star review (I've read them all) but here it is.<br /><br />I don't know what to say Mike.  This is an uninspired and tiresome novel that has none of the complexities of your early novels.  I couldn't help but notice you included an obligatory attack on our hero by hired goons sending him to the hospital.  It's the kind of thing a screenwriter would insert into a script even though it wasn't in the book because the movie needs a `little something in the middle' to step up the action before the big finale.  But you made it easy for them by working it right into the novel. That scene will look great in the trailer for the film.<br /><br />Which brings me to my biggest complaint. The Fifth Witness reads like it was written for the silver screen.  The Lincoln Lawyer has been turned into a big budget Hollywood movie and it appears you want to provide Matthew McConaughey with steady work and a franchise character.<br /><br />And don't get me started on that little `life altering twist' in the final pages regarding Mickey's future.  Ugh.  That just screams \\"Hollywood\\".<br /><br />I must say, I thought the whole novel felt flat but I was especially annoyed by the ending. The conclusion was as predictable as it was improbable.  It may work for a popcorn movie where the viewer's investment is much lower, but for readers (at least this reader) you need to aim higher.  The ending has to bear scrutiny and this one doesn't.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder why you're releasing a new novel a mere six months after The Reversal hit book stores?  I know Hollywood can be enticing and the money must be good - really good (a lot more than book sales I imagine) but if this is the future - a new screenplay, thinly disguised as a novel, churned out every six months a la James Patterson - I may have to add you to the list of authors I have given up on.  (I know - I can't believe I said it either).<br /><br />Do me a favor - resist Hollywood and the pressure from the publishing industry - and produce quality, not quantity.and the pressure from the publishing industry - and produce quality, not quantity.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I use this adapter regularly to connect my MacBook Pro to my TV. This adapter worked great at first, and worked great until just now. It no longer works. It appears that the individual wires inside the white cable have broken. Wiggling the neck of the adapter flashing the display on and off. My adapter didn't come from Amazon, it came from one of the 3rd parties, so I'm S.O.L., but FYI mono price.com is selling a different adapter that does the same thing (including audio support) for $7. That's where I'll be buying my new adapter from.
B004XJHBCE|3.0|There are a few of these organizer apps in the Android marketplace. The problem with all of them is that they do not integrate well with the Android file system or the Android desktop. They create a layer on top of everything that you have to organize separately from your native Android folders. I have tried these organizers a couple of times and always gave up because they were more cumbersome and resource intensive than the native Android tools. You can try this organizer to see if it works for you. But if you want a new look for your Android device or more file management features, I suggest trying a new launcher like ADW or a lower level file manager like Astro.
B0036S4CTS|3.0|I was really enjoying this book until close to the end.  I think it should have ended in another way.  I'm not sure why the author decided to end the way she did.  wish I had just stopped reading it about 75 pages from the end.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I had, of course, heard and read the rave reviews for \\"The King's Speech.\\"  I had, of course, heard of the Oscar nominations and then the wins (Best Picture; Best Actor for Colin Firth plus more). I bought it quite a while ago and put it aside until I was \\"in the mood\\" to watch what I thought was going to be a fairly dry movie.  I pulled it out tonight and finally watched it.  And I am so glad I did.  What a marvelous, heartwarming glimpse of history.<br /><br />I personally don't remember King George VI but I definitely remember the Queen Mother and of course Queen Elizabeth and Princess margaret.  This movie not only told a story of the King but gave me some insight into the rest of his family's lives.<br /><br />Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush were superb in their roles, as was Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />This movie touched my heart.  I would recommend it to anyone.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I do not remember ever watching another movie like this. It comes from a Philip K. Dick short story, which does not surprise me as his works are somewhat off the wall (in a good way!). This is a very interesting movie, with a cool and fun plot. At then end, there are some unanswered questions that, to me, only add to the mystique of the movie. What is the purpose of all that happens? Why is there a \\"plan?\\" Who is in charge and why?

B0052OWGYW|5.0|I like this version of The Mechanic more than I liked the original. This has a better ending.

Small detail, I know...
0670022411|4.0|So, what do we know about this author?  She's obviously read the Twilight series.  She is also obviously planning a sequel.  Oh, and we obviously know she's a very good writer.<br /><br />I kept feeling Edward and Bella nearby the whole time I was reading this book, and that, at first, made me angry.  Then, as I read on, I realized that although it is quite reminiscent of the Twilight series, it is also a good book that can stand on it's own.<br /><br />I am not happy that there is a sequel.  I would have liked it if she wrapped the whole Ashmole mystery up, but, oh well...so much for that!  I get the impression, and I could be wrong, that at first she had no intention at all of doing a sequel.  At first it seemed she was getting to the point, and that we would see some conclusion to this book, but then it took a turn when the main characters left England and went to New York.  Then things dragged and seemed to take on another direction altogether, which led me to quickly assume we were in the Sea of Sequels and I was drowning!  Not that I don't like sequels...don't get me wrong...I just was expecting this was a one time book.  I am hoping she doesn't drag things out like Diana Gabaldon has done to her Outlander series.<br /><br />All in all, this is a good, solid book with engaging characters and interesting, complex storyline.  If you are up for quick read with tidy ending...this isn't it.  This is leading us elsewhere and it seems like Deborah has set us up for some great reading in the future!
B0053F042G|4.0|This was worth renting. Interesting plot, suspenseful at times, fast action, love interest. Good flick that will appeal to guys, but with some chick-flick characteristics.

Frank Langella was good, but his character was predictable, as was the plot. Think about it as you watch: \\"what is the only reasonable reason for the actions of the wife, January Jones.\\" Whatever. Definitely worth the time and money to watch!

0802473156|5.0|i loved this book (i read the kindle version). a lot of the people who gave it low ratings said it was full of simple common sense.  to a point, that's true. but 1) simple is NOT the same as easy and 2) when your marriage is in crisis, common sense goes out the window and you start trying crazy things to solve the problem. or you can't even TRY to solve it at all and it spirals out of control. who can think clearly when there is that much tension at home? its nice to have someone point out some really basic changes to make.    my husband and i have COMPLETELY DIFFERENT languages. because of that, we didn't really understand what the other person needed because it was SO DIFFERENT from what each of us needed. we didn't realize how much our actions or lack of actions around a certain \\"language\\" affected the other person. now that i understand, of COURSE it seems like common sense, because it is SO SIMPLE. but i DID need someone else to point it out. thank god for Chapman!    this book gives PRODUCTIVE, action-oriented things you can physically DO to help your marriage. most of them take not even 5 minutes a day.     its made a HUGE difference for us. i read it about 7 months ago and my house has been a happy and peaceful place ever since (even through some heated arguments and differences of opinion). i hope it helps you as much.

0553801473|2.0|I was a huge fan of the first four books. The grim realism, the details, the mix of flawed characters and their flawed decisions making such a huge mess, the crafty storytelling - all of it set this series miles and miles above much of the fantasy out there.<br /><br />Something went wrong here though. The first 350 pages of this book are painfully boring, with the exception of Bran and \\"Reek.\\" We have travelogues, endless tangents about irrelevant people and places, far too much exposition, and chapters that could have been cut. I am all for atmosphere and immersion into a fictional world, but there's a point where the story gets buried under it and it becomes self-indulgent. The book picks up a bit somewhere between a third and halfway in, once the plot in the North gets going, but overall it's still bloated and riddled with POV characters I'm not entirely sure needed to be POV characters.<br /><br />(Warning: Some spoilers ahead)<br /><br />Dany, Jon, and Tyrion are the least interesting of all the POVs, and sadly they take up most of the book. Dany is shown to be an inept ruler, emotional and slightly crazy, and after pretty much showing us the same thing in different ways from his only other female rulers, Cersie and Lysa Tully, he seems to be endorsing the notion that women (particularly mothers) are unfit to rule. Men have honor, women have emotions, seems to be his idea when comparing Dany with equally well-intentioned but unsuccessful male rulers such as Ned and Jon. Tyrion's arc is meandering and ridiculous, and goes nowhere. Tyrion himself has become unsympathetic and somewhat disgusting. I am sick and tired of his sense of entitlement to the mutual love and attraction of beautiful women, and the terrible things he does to them when he doesn't get it. And this is GRRM's favorite character. Jon is the best of the three, taking on the hard task of putting aside centuries of bad blood between his people and their enemies in order to work together to save humanity from a worse enemy. He cares for others and does the best he can. Unfortunately, his arc ends in a tacky cliffhanger.<br /><br />There are other problems too besides a serious lack of entertainment value. GRRM's gotten lazy and repetitive. The same phrases are used over and over. The good old switcheroo/fake death is overused. He used it well with Bran and Rickon in the second book, and with the fake Arya, but now we have this ridiculous &lt;s>shark jump&lt;/s>\\"plot twist\\" where a long presumed characters turns up so he can... have Dany's plotline! I hope he's fake and a political pawn, but nonetheless the story arc needlessly convolutes the story. Another character gets magically switcheroo'd at the Wall, Davos gets switcheroo'd, and there's always been the possibility that Jeyne Stark (nee Westerling) has switcheroo'd herself as well.  Ashara Dayne might be alive and well too. That's too many and all of it takes away from the realism that once made the story so great.<br /><br />Speaking of the realism, which I was as thrilled to see in a fantasy series as much anyone else, I feel we've moved past accurately and unflinchingly depicting the harsh realities of a pseudo-medeival society and descended into the dark pit of TMI about the author's twisted fixations. AFFC slid down this slope too, but it's gotten worse. Rape, rape, rape, rape, rape, rape. GRRM's begun to revel in the primitive sickness of his society, and his villains, in the crudeness and grossness. Honestly, it's getting creepy. Uncomfortably so. Same with mutilation, maiming, and horrid disfigurement. The Right of the First Night has cropped up, that fantasy of all twisted males (which is certainly not to say all males). We have a stomach-turning wedding night scene, which happens to include a male character forced into a sex act with a pretty, frightened, and naked 13 year-old girl. I'm neither a prude, nor the sort who looks for reason to be offended, but I found some of the content over the line. Villains like Ramsey Bolton, and Roose in this volume, are cheap shock value at any case. I expected more from a series of this caliber than the standard rapist/torture villain. \\"Behave or I will flay you all!\\" Come on now.<br /><br />GRRM has included his first gay male POV character, and though it's always good to see this sort of diversity, I'm wondering why he portrays sex between women as a casual diversion in order to scratch an inch, whereas male homosexuality (Loras/Renly and Connington, who loved Rhaegar) is held up in the light of great devotion and loyality. Hmm.<br /><br />All in all, I give praise for Bran, Asha, \\"Reek,\\" and Melisandre, and I may skim through subsequent volumes to see what happens to a handful of characters, but I no longer have the fierce love for the series I did before cracking this one open, and I'm very sad to have to say that.
B004WPT3ZM|5.0|This is one of Megadeth's finest pieces of work, a thrash masterpiece if you will. This remaster completely blows the orignial recording out of the water! I listened to the disc on my Dolby Pro-Logic System and it sounds completely phenomenal and flawless. Just wish this came out with a stand alone version w/o the live disc. I'm not big on live recordings for the most part, just a few exceptions. The quality of the live disc isn't nothing to write home about. Hopefully they will remaster their entire catalogue sooner than later.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|There is no way you can give the whole series one star, just because of the changes. It hasn't ruined the whole movie(s).  Am I crazy about it, no. I am going to wait till the \\"Bits\\" gets the discs, and then decide if I'll keep my pre-order  alive or not. But I really would like to see these in HD. It could be MANY years before another version is available.    Consider all the Re-masters in the audio world. Now even though they try to get it exactly right,  there is no way all the Beatles CD's have the same exact mix as when George Martin originally mixed them,  or any other artist for that matter.    Of course that is done to \\"improve\\" what we hear. But you could call  this tampering with the original work as well. But for some reason,  this is more accepted as being OK.    The only thing I can figure, George feels this is an improvement as well.   Of course, that is a matter of opinion.
B004UHF51S|4.0|It seems so many of us have lived our lives with and through Michael Franks' beautiful music - Time Together is another glorious and welcome chapter in in our Timeless journey Together. I particularly like the lyrics and melody of Mice but then all the tracks are great.

B003JZCL4Q|3.0|Does anyone know why this set is more than a $130 and [[ASIN:B00402FGEE Sgu Stargate Universe: Complete First Season [Blu-ray]]] this one is like $30? is there any difference?
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I've been using this app for several months, and it's near the top of my list of apps I couldn't do without. It makes organizing and finding my 250+ apps nearly effortless.  It is extremely flexible--just note that the most obvious way of doing something is not always the optimal way. Reading the documentation will get you started on the right path.  Recommended without reservation!
