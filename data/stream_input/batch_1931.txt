B004J4WL50|5.0|Blake and business people like him need to be the inspiration for the future of business. We need to recognize that businesses are not in a vacuum, but are part of the world around them and business leaders and entrepreneurs need to enjoy what they do, follow their passion, create a vibrant work environment, and try to improve the world around them. If this ethos can take hold, we will reach a higher plane in business and a new, deserved respect will come to those in the business world. I wish more large corporations and investment banks could learn from stories like this. A great read if you are a business person, entrepreneur, investor, if you are anti-business (this will open your eyes). I guess this should be read if you are human.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|This is another advent calendar that brings many smiles.<br />The story that follows along is fun and enjoyable.<br />Definately a positive!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|The streaming was great, no interruptions. The movie was great, lots of action. Will add this to my movie collection
1449410243|4.0|Saw this and knowing a lady devoted to her cats, I had to get it for her. She said she had seen it in the bookstore and was curious about it but did not buy it. Glad she didn't as it was the perfect gift for her.<br />Pat N.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|This show is without a doubt the funniest show on TV. (Okay that's a bit biased) Maybe only ONE of the funniest shows on TV but it's definitely in the running for Funniest.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|While this is not my favorite author, this was a good read. I would recommend it.<br />Pat has an interesting take on her character's  fictional occupation.<br />Pat Nieman
B00632HWOG|3.0|Easy to use, installed on kindle fire original, but needs littile bit of work between screen navigations and font size maybe big buttons and there are alot of settings (not sure if regular users would get to use them all) in particular allow user to swtich between pages easier.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Need I say more.  I've not read all his works but of those I've read this ranks among the best for action and mystery.
B008GXHOFW|4.0|My grandson has not complained about this game so I'm assuming it is okay.  It definitely keeps him quiet and that's a good thing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|He's one of my favorite mystery writers so my review is totally biased,  I enjoy his work featuring a rough and ready Rapp who speaks his mind and is tough enough to work through political BS.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't really have any complaints about this game as I haven't played it very much.  I'm into Pyramid Solitaire and play that a lot right now but once I tire of pyramid, this is waiting.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|If you have not started watching Downton Abbey then you are missing out. At first when I heard about a soap opera like show on BBC about maids taking place in the early 20th century I was skeptical, but I was hooked after the first episode and saw all 3 seasons in 2 weeks. This show is second only to Battlestar Galactica for my all time favorite shows list.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|This novel had it all:  Characters that were interesting, setting and descriptions that had me looking at maps, action all. The way, and a feel-good conclusion.  I want more John Corey action!
1449408656|5.0|Great Book.<br />Has great illustrations with great humor that cat owners(or people that interact with cat owners) can relate to.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very entertaining story and hope to read about cylo 17.  If it follows Wool 1_5 then it should be another great story.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Too bad Scalzi is done with this universe. Otherwise it would have been a five star rating from me. wtf with kindle price being more expensive than cutting down a tree, transporting it to a paper mill, making paper out of it, printing the book, binding the book, and mailing it to me?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was a great book, it caught my attention right from the start and went in depth to develop the characters backgrounds and kept my attention the whole way through.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is a nice app.  It works great on my Kindle.  I like the way that I can get the current, local forecast.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I had no idea what to expect from this book when I started. I sat with my mouth open at the end in shock. Very well written.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is a great app!  It working just like I want it to.  Choice of different decks and colors is great!
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|This is a wonderful historical romance with flawed characters that grow throughout the story.  I love Ms Milan's writing as she weaves stories with amazing characters.<br /><br />Robert Blaisdell, the Ninth Duke of Clermont is a puzzling man who is trying to make amends for his father's wrongs.  His father was not in the habit of treating people well, including his wife and son.  Robert has a secret that he does not want anyone to know about, yet it helps him deal with who he is.<br /><br />Robert meets Wilhelmina Pursling while she was being accused by George Stevens, Captain of the town's Militia of writing handbills that may cause worker upheaval and problems for factory owners, and although not a true beauty, he sees something in her that attracts him.<br /><br />Minnie leads a quiet life living with her Great-aunts and has no wish to be the center of attention, as a matter of fact when she is in a crowd, many times she faints as she has a memory of a swarm of people surrounding her, calling out her name as they spit and throw rocks.  She was twelve at the time and her world had just been destroyed.  When Minnie was a child, her father passed her off as a boy for the first twelve years of her life.  Her father loved and adored her and wanted to take her when he traveled, so he dresses her up as a boy and called her Maximilian Lane.  She was a brilliant chess player and they both played all over while traveling, until her world crumbled around her and she was betrayed.<br /><br />Minnie figures out Robert's secret and although silently applauds his ingenuity, she does not want anything to do with it, as she does not want her past discovered.<br /><br />As we learn about Robert's past we see how his early years shaped who he is now and notice that he is an emotional wreak as he had no love while growing up until he was accepted unconditionally by a half brother he never knew about.  Oliver was raised by loving parents however Robert's father was cruel to both hismother and to Oliver, never accepting him.  Robert would do anything for Oliver including telling secrets.<br /><br />As Minnie tries to prove her innocence Robert is amazed by her and asks her to marry him.  Because of her past and his, she doesn't want to; feeling someone of her status should not marry a duke.  She is also worried about what people will think if and when they find out who she really is.<br /><br />What an emotional story, Ms Milan writes such compelling characters in all her books, they usually are surprisingly wonderful people with interesting histories.  I loved how Minnie and Robert are not necessarily attracted to each other in the beginning and when they marry, they may not even feel love.  However we see the feelings grow as they spend time together and when they have to deal with a crisis we see the emotional tug of war that goes on between the two and how heartrending to see how it is resolved.  I really enjoyed the secondary characters which include Oliver, Sebastian and Violet and look forward to their stories.
B00511PTWM|5.0|I got this adapter to be able to power my gps while also listening to my iPod through the radio adapter. My car has a short lighter plug and some adapters don't fit, so I was happy to find that this one fit fine. It is large in size, as other reviews have said. Because it swivels, I was able to put it into the socket and then arrange it so it is parallel to the dash rather than sticking out perpendicularly, so everything fits pretty well out of the way. I'm happy with the adapter.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a very interesting book with a lot of unexpected &#34;twists and turns&#34;.  I would tell people to read it.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The possessive, obsessive, and mood-rocking perspective on romance The XX take in this album is the other side of the ecstatic large-hearted hopefulness of their first album. Things get dark here, and the music evokes a crazy love only an adolescent can't express without concluding you're just not getting it. It sounds sparse, slow, and at the same time antsy, impatient, and frustrated. It's the oddest thing I've heard in a long while and what's strangest is how well it works.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Quick, easy, large colorful buttons.  I also like that it remembers your last calculation upon restarting.  Great little app. Price is a plus also.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This is in the top five of worst movies I have ever see in 52 years of movie watching.  Only two Will Ferrell movies were worse than this.  This is 1 1/2 hours of my life I can never get back.  Seth McFarlane- not funny IMO.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The series is a departure from  the usual thin depictions of British archetypes. The characters are never out of the persona, the role, that living in England at that time has assigned to them. But because of the changes in that very rigid and tidy world, (as charming and gracious as it is), the conflicts those changes have created is a fascinating story about the end of the Victorian age and ultimately the end of Empire. The symbolic commitment to the bricks and mortar of the Abbey as a commitment to a way of life is brilliantly  expressed.
0385344333|5.0|Loved the book. It was as good or better than all the other Jack Reacher novels from Lee Child that I have read.
1558908846|5.0|This movie is some solid 90's sci-fi cheese. A little groan-worthy at parts but never unwatchable. Easily a 4 star movie for any sci-fi fan, though I'm giving it 5 simply because of the price. Almost everyone has 5 bucks to spare, and if you're a regular Amazon shopper, and a sci-fi fan, this is one of the best deals you'll find.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|received the movie in time for Christmas!  It was a great deal and my kids love it!! Very happy with my purchase!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun way to pass the time that does not require too much brain power enough levels that it lasts for a long time
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 9 year old likes this game, he just prefers the full size version on the computer better.  He said he does recommend this product :)
B004H3WWU2|5.0|I use this as my daily work bag.  It very compact, so if you are they type to take a lot of things back and forth to work, this might not be for you.  For those of you that travel light, this thing is awesome.  I still receive compliments on my bag a year after I purchased.  This are pricey but totally worth it.  They have held up like no other bag I have.  I used to go through messenger bags and backpacks about every 6 months.  This thing still looks brand new.<br /><br />The product did come with an interesting smell, like a cross between new rubber and skunk, but it wears off after a little while.  Tons of pockets to hold charges and adapters and I have no problem toting my 15&#34; laptop and iPad.  It is rather small, so the strap pockets do do me any good being over 6' tall.  But the durability and design trump those minor issues.<br /><br />The next bag I purchase, will be from this company.  Excellent product.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Plenty of room for extra lenses your camera, your camcorder, all your accessories etc..Tripod attaches to the outside of the bag ..and it was a gift from Amazon.com for purchasing the Canon Rebel T3...Only problem was one of the inside pocket zippers broke...But other than that excellent product....!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The movie was wery entertaining  but fell short in providing adequate background information.  After reviewing the movie, I purchased all three books and then watched the movie again.  I am anxiously awaiting the second movie of the trilogy.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a bunch of crap. So what he bought a lot of toys and she learned to like them. Take the toys away neither of them do anything creative in bed.<br />EL James' husband said in an interview that he edited it. He also said they had no promoter. I wonder if it is self-published and they just got lucky with word of mouth. She uses the same adjectives, adverbs, verbs over and over, words such as chastely. It is gratingly annoying. One of my favorites was when she mentioned a painting of a fiesta in an Italian restaurant. Seems like sombreros just don't belong there. Maybe they should have hung a picture of an Italian FESTA!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is a mix of Greek  mythology and something else.<br />I really liked this book.<br />I would recommend it to every one i come across.
030758836X|4.0|It's been a long time since I read a book that falls so squarely into the adult-psychological-thriller category, and to be honest, I doubted whether I could really enjoy it. I often find that books in these categories are either a) completely unbelievable and I get eye strain from rolling my eyes so often, or b) the characters are so flat and transparent that I really don't give a fig about what happens to them.<br />In Gone Girl, however, Gillian Flynn has created a story that is both believable but also stretched my imagination as a reader and characters that although definitely not in the likeable category were anything but flat.<br /><br />The story smacks of tension right from the beginning, and as the story progresses I found myself more and more drawn into the world of Nick and Amy and wanting to know more about them - their families, their relationship, their whole history together and how it related to what was happening in the current day.<br /><br />Gone Girl has some really good points for more thought too - were Amy's parents' overbearing and more than slightly over-protective nature so damaging on her psyche, or was she simply born the way she was, hard-wired into her brains? Was Nick's upbringing and his father part of the reason he felt it so difficult to connect with and empathise with his wife? Do we ever really know the person we are partnered with, or do they have a side that we never really see? Such questions are what makes this book a true psychological thriller, and so very hard to predict exactly what will happen next.<br /><br />My only criticism, and it's not even that, it's more a warning to other people that need to like at least one main character is that I found none of the main characters particularly likeable at all, with perhaps the exception of Nick's sister Go, who with her unique personality and sarcastic, dirty sense I felt quite an affinity with and I do wish she had played more of a part in the story. But for the most part, Nick, Amy, their parents and friends are either quite self-centred, arrogant people or they don't play a big enough role to really have an impact.<br /><br />And the million dollar question - the ending? I anticipated it because I wanted to know what happened, yet dreading it because I was really enjoying the twists and turns of the story, but in the end I can say I was pretty satisfied as a whole. It didn't feel rushed, contrived or unbelievable, and that's a true testament to the way that Gillian Flynn writes.ck, Amy, their parents and friends are either quite self-centred, arrogant people or they don't play a big enough role to really have an impact.<br /><br />And the million dollar question - the ending?

B00AAX68HG|5.0|I can't stop playing! One of the best puzzle games off amazon! Very cute and awesome game. Very different from other games<br />.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid yet!!! On the kindle it was even better!! I loved it!

B009FZHYKU|4.0|This show is great and streams well. Its not your zombie series, it has meaning and is interesting and i dint like zombie related shows or movies! Very happy I bought it!!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good book. It kept my interest and was hard to put down. I hated that it ended so soon. That in my opinion is what a good book is.
B008J34466|1.0|Pink, please have more respect for yourself. You are a role model; whether you like it or not you have more social responsibility than most. I've always admired you and picked up this CD on faith in your talent. On listening I wish I'd been more careful with my time & money. Little musical merit, lots of repetition, and sickening for young people who may think these lyrics describe what life is about. If I had really looked at the cover art or read the track titles I'd have gotten a clue as to the trash this CD was going to deliver, but unfortunately I was blinded by my appreciation for your previous work. Never again!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked this series very much, though had some issue with getting into book 4, Beautiful Redemption. The writing flows well and I had a hard time putting it down. Throughout the series I genuinely laughed and cried. I would reccomend for anyone who liked the Twilight/Trueblood/Hunger Games series.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This is for the 3-Disc DVD Extended Collector's Edition. I have not even watched either of the two alternate extended versions of the film yet, but even at that it is worth five stars, and can only get better. This set is beautifully contained in a slipcase hardcover book-style package. As someone who loves real, tactile objects, I like this very much, and feel compelled to put it on a bookshelf or something. One other nice thing is the availability of an alternate \\"family friendly\\" audio track that is sans-profanity. That is a rarely seen but very nice, inclusive touch.<br /><br />There is really not much that I could say to add to what has already been said about this film. In terms of the official Amazon product review above, I am one of those people who sees the characters as, \\"broad, useful archetypes.\\" Yes, the plot is simple, relatively unsurprising and not a story that hasn't been told before. And yes, the message is very overt. But it is all executed clearly and concisely. So many films that I have seen lately end up as train wrecks of convoluted or unfullfilled thematic ambitions. I realize that for some people, Avatar's very deliberate method and occasionally blunt-force symbolism (\\"unobtainium\\") are not the ingredients of a great film. For me, though, it is a very powerful story that is told very effectively.<br /><br />The other element, of course, is the visual one. I do not know if I have ever seen anything so incredibly awe-inspiring. Beautiful, gorgeous, ominous, obviously otherworldly. This is a film where James Cameron and company went all-out to create the most immersive sensory experience that had ever been onscreen. This is something completely different from a standard \\"effects blockbuster\\" movie. Even the music is perfectly in sync to the environment. And the greatest beauty is how it all serves the story. These aren't visual effects for the sake of saying, \\"hey, look what we can do.\\" It's all story driven and for me it is captivating like nothing else.
B006WWUDGQ|5.0|I gave this a 5 Star because unlike most singers her albums have several hits and singles on them.  Most artists have one or two hits on an album but her entire album is full of hits you would know and love. Great stuff!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a great series for anyone, but especially for those that have a love of history! Season 3 starts soon and I can't wait!
030758836X|4.0|The book kept my interest, and the plot line was not predictable.  The  writing itself is just standard, not sublime.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book. Different from what I normally read. Spoken from the dog's perspective. I would highly recommend it to everyone.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game Jet Pack Joy Ride! Its full of fun difficult levels that r addicting! U can change his clothes hair and jet packs when u have the coins u need! The game sends u on missions to complete certain tasks that will help u out through the levels! I'm certain that u will enjoy this fun filled game and will not regret purchasing this item!

B00A03WBVI|5.0|If u r a fan of One Direction u will absolutely love their latest album Take Me Home! Its full of fun amazing songs that u will never get enough of. I not only bought this album to hear those talented 5 voices but also those songs in that album can make u feel up when ur down or better about yourself. It also has a great beat to were u want to get up and dance! Obviously the boys have great taste in music and now u can to!
0307352145|5.0|I love reading this book and though I'm not done with it, this books is excellent.  I am an introvert and I thank the author for writing this book and showing the world that invtroverts can be and are powerful people.  We just don't have to make a lot of noise to be powerful.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The three books in this series provides a scenario for the post Obama decades.  I would suggest this book to anyone with an open mind to the current situation of constant authoritarian encroachment on the freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States, to include All of the Amendments.  Being a male I didn't identify with Katness, but being the father of two beautiful daughters, I felt a great deal of protectiveness and desire to give support to her and all the characters,  The theme is this is what we and our children/grandchildren have to look forward to if we don't resist the current slide down the sippery slope of liberalism.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I still recommend this cooler for custom builds this long after it came out.  There are updated and new models, but this one is the truth when it comes to air cooling.  There are more expensive coolers that might drop the temps a degree or two, but this thing is a beast for the price.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|The special effects were very good but the directing was terrible.  This young gal has been locked in the tower for years and as soon as she breaks out she runs like hell down the hall and through the village. She manages to escape through a drainage system then jumps off a cliff and swims to safety.  And there, behold, just happens to be a white horse to save her.  After years of captivity she somehow knows how to ride a horse bareback, at breakneck speed,  without falling off.<br />The Huntsman made the movie.
1587613379|5.0|I am sure that there are two people somewhere on the planet that have abolutely no contact to other people other than their spouse, and they are perfectly happy.  For that couple, monogomy is for them.  For the rest of us, however, we are all polyamorous.<br /><br />Some have said \\"It takes a village to raise a child.\\"  I also believe that for most of us (99% of us) it takes a village to bring us happiness and fufilment.  For some people, that fufilment and happiness is aided by a large extended family, children, friends, and coworkers.  For others, that fufilment and happiness is helped by lovers, swingers, and prostitutes.  While those two examples are on far different ends of the \\"social norm,\\" the truth remains the same that most of us need more than our significant others to be happy.<br /><br />Once we realize this fact, we can free ourselves from the guilt, responsibility, and burden of feeling like we have to be the one who provides this happiness and fufilment to our partner.  We also can rid ourselves of the constant fear that our spouse may not be \\"the one\\" as we question the root of our unhappiness.<br /><br />On the surface, most people will think a book promoting polyamory will be about ignoring your spouse and finding happiness elsewhere.  This couldn't be further from the truth.  We ALL need more than just our spouse.  This book helps us to realize that, and actually helps us to appreciate and love our spouse like we did when we first fell in love.<br /><br />If you truly believe in the \\"Leave it to Beaver/ Brady Bunch\\" myth, then do not buy this book.  If you want to take relationships into the 21st century and the cutting edge, then please buy this book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|In parts not as easy to follow as books 1 & 2.  Overall a stirring conclusion to the series.<br />Do not read the books out of order.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|me and my boyfriend play this all the time. we love it. great app and great on the kindle screen since its bigger that a cell.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Work perfectly with Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Allowing my son to view youtube on Kindle Fire HD 8.9. It still works in  Kindle Freetime too. There is a litte add banner on the bottom. It is free so I can not complain but I rather pay for it to remove the ads. The best part is we have YOUTUBE on Kindle Fire HD. I still can not believe that Amazon use Android OS for its Kindle Fire HD but does not allow youtube on its kindle Fire HD. Come on Amazon.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|The app is alright. Kinda disappointed in the camera. You can only take pictures facing the screen on the kindle do to the placement of the lens and the flash isn't great. The app is good for the quality of the camera in the kindle hd.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Lot's of futurist eye candy and tons (and I mean TONS) of plot holes but, in general, a decent scifi escape for a night on the couch with pizza.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters. That's more a commentary on the high rice of movie tickets than it is a comment on the quality of the film, by the way. That said, the $4.99 for the HD stream was pretty much exactly appropriate for the two of use.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Was a gift for my teenager. They loved it. I will order the next season when it comes available. thanks.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|For what you pay, it really is a pretty good amp. It's not the biggest bass booster, but sometimes I like using this one more than my E6, due to the more neutral bass boost on the E5 v.s the distortion the E6 sometimes brings to bass heavy tracks on boost.

B00913DPW2|4.0|Fun but it was too easy to beat. I downloaded it as the free app of the day on my kindle fire, and beat it that night.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|this game keeps my kids interested for atleast an hour a piece! I like to play it too. maybe more for older kids though, around 6-10 or so... Overall***I think its pretty awesome
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Ian Rankin as ususal does it great job with his Ebus novels and this time it is especially interesting in dealing with the all too prsent political correectness climate where no one speaks their real mind.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game. It's fun and my grandchildren love it.<br />Download and give it a try. It sure is a neat game. I recommend it.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|This movie is not awful, as some reviewers expressed. It is predictable following a typical Hollywood trajectory around self discovery and ending up with the good girl and a bright future. In fact, Matthew McConaughey does a pretty good job of acting as a nightclub owner, con-man, and ex-stripper.  The stripper numbers are comic but fully of muscle boy eye-candy. Channing Tatum does a respectable job of acting and a surprising job as a dancer and stripper. Alex Pettyfer plays the innocent 19 year old construction worker whose eyes are opened to a world of sex and drugs by Magic Mike, the role played by Tatum. Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer played minor roles which was a bit disappointing. In the end, I would summarize by saying that this is a fairly predictable Hollywood production that is entertaining but not has no message other than everyone has to grow up some day.
1444737112|5.0|Very uplifting true story which was a nice offset to all the bad news around.  Sent copies to all family members and close friends and all loved it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Ok, that may be a matter of taste.  But I read Bossypants in bed as a way to relax after a long day of studying, and frequently woke my wife up because the bed was shaking from trying to hold in my laughter.  Fey is a riot!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Great app, well organized, and love the &#34;scan and search&#34; feature.  I just wish it would give you the &#34;remember me&#34; option for the password, like the computer based version does.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Love the show and the fourth season is just as good as the other three! The interplay by the leads is the best!
034580404X|3.0|No idea really. The wife read it. If things get kinky, I'll let you know in greater detail. Good luck.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|We watch it every year. And the old VCR finally gave up the ghost. The blu ray is crystal clear.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|This is a great movie with well written narration.  Tim Allen does a great job with the narration.  Great story and I hope they do more on Oscar.
B00AP5Z2F8|1.0|Regretfully I have to give this book a poor review.<br /><br />I love the GoPro camera (Black Edition) but this book misses a lot of explanation and useful tips. It seems the author wants a quick win by writing a useless book of a perfect product (GoPro cameras).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the thrilling end to a wonderful series. One of many thins I wish is that it wasn't over. Many sad things happen in the book, but all of them are made up for by the excitement, the romance, and the ending that I was both dreading and eagerly awaiting.
0843178132|5.0|Yes, you can find this information in the product dimensions, but unless you've ordered a bunch of these Little Miss books for a collection only to find that some are the larger book and some are the smaller book, you probably would not think to check the dimensions first.<br /><br />My daughter loves all the Little Miss books.  This smaller size easily fits into most little girls' purses.

B009JNXK88|4.0|This is a great platformer, and is easily played as-is, but I, personally, would highly recommend a (Bluetooth) gamepad if you want to truly enjoy the game.<br /><br />Objectives are clearly spelled out, but not overtly so, and the game is adequately challenging and rewarding.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|This is quite whimsical, go a little bored half way thru though, The ending was a little disappointing. In general an entertaining book.
0525478817|1.0|I read dozens of young adult books a year. Many have difficult (even horrifying) topics, so please don't say I was squeamish. I also record a number of these for a non-profit each year and the voices need to ring true. (I work with adolescents, so I know their voices).<br />This book is poorly written and painfully long.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|I love this game on my Kindle Fire. It is difficult to find Kakuro books in stores. I just wish that the larger puzzles had smaller boxes to better fit my screen! Other than that, worth every penny!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I can read this book over & over & over again and never ever get sick of it! This book is my favorite of the whole trilogy!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|amazing! would read again & again! I just finished reading the trilogy for the second time! Christian Grey...where on Earth are you?! LOL
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this dvd, The acting, history and scenery were wonderful. Sorry to see it end. Can't wait for Season 2
B005LAII08|4.0|Great familiy film, 3D effects add to the overall experiance. The voices are great and match the animated characters perfectly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Suffers is amazing. Its lightyears ahead of the popular Temple Run. The game is not repetetive at all and is constantly updating you with new challenges to complete. But the best way to play this game is to synch it with Facebook to compete with your friends. Amazing game. Get it, and plus, it's free!
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|My son loves this app, didn't take too much work to download it on his Nabi, the only bummer is he has to play it on mommy mode. Other than that no issues at all! :)
B005I64U5C|4.0|If you like comic book heroes, add this one to your collection.  I''m only giving it 4 stars because I felt there could have been more 3d content,  Still, I would recommend this item to my friends.
B007XF0X6G|4.0|Excellent 3D effects throughout this movie.  We also have the sequel and it's just as good as the first one.  I would recommend this movie to my friends who like the movies about the ancient Gods of Greece!
B003QTUQGU|5.0|I'm a big Johnny Depp fan and this movie in 3D was worth the purchase price.  The 3d effects are outstanding - would put it in the category of one of the best 3d movies I have seen yet.  It's not just for children, adults will enjoy this movie also.  It feels like you can reach out an touch most of the 3d effects!  AWESOME ADVENTURE to watch!!!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I love it. Wish there were more shows like this on tv.  Great stories, great writting, and fabulous characters. It always leaves me wanting more.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it is a good fast paced solitaire. easy to use and fun.plenty of chances for success.I would recomend Mitford anyone.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Fun game! Wish I could afford to buy the full version. Very creative game. The graphics are fantastic. The story line is great.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I find myself opening this often. You feel like you have more control over keeping your tablet alive! Good app
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I was looking for a case that would allow me to set it in my lap at a comfortable reading angle. Many times, holding an e-reader for longer than an hour will cause come hand/wrist discomfort. This case allows for some much needed &#34;wrist rest&#34;. Also it is nice to use in the kitchen when looking at a recipe. I also love the sleep feature. It would be nice if this same case was created for the original kindle fire. Then I could upgrade the kids cases.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|It had none of the fun, campiness of the original and yet somehow still managed to not be straight enough to take it seriously. Fail on both attempts. And the special effects were not great. It was basically nothing but boring.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|this is a great mix of music for anyon who loves the show and would be a great gift to the people who do like the show
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|I almost didn't get this version because it was missing in my opinion two essential songs from Les Miz, Do You Hear the People Sing and A Little Fall of rain, but the fact that it had all the my other favorite songs and the price was right (only $5), and I wasn't disappointed.  The songs sound great with the huge Hollywood orchestra, Hugh Jackman is amazing as is the rest of the cast, and I have had it in my car constantly  since I got it.  Before you give it a low rating before even listening to it just because it is missing the songs you feel should be on there, remember it is only the Highlights, and give it a listen anyway, you might be amazed anyway.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I lost my kindle Fire cord and couldn't find it anywhere. Hard to get a replacement. Some places advertise that their cords are good for the Fire and they DON'T work, I've tried. I gave it another shot and ordered this one and thank goodness that it works just fine! Very satisfied. Thank you!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book is very cool and very good I read it in a week please get it in the app store
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This is truly amazing set of DVD. Each episode filled with thrills. Peter Falk acts so well as Lt. Coloumbo. Does anyone know his first name or seen his wife?
B002RI9UBS|5.0|A wonderful book, made into a wonderful movie. Yann Martel's amazing book, beautifully made into a movie by Ang Lee. Every moment of the story is a Zen parable.
B005CA4SJW|5.0|did not expect to get caught up after Breaking Bad, Madmen, Dexter. But the cliff hangers are great and the storyline is evolving.
B00A6N8F4Y|5.0|Loved this movie. I have to say this is one awesome part for John Travolta he played it well. Loved the house that the movie was shot in it was awesome. Great movie that kept you wondering.
B007704HO6|3.0|This was a cute book but not quite what I was expecting.  I enjoyed it but wouldn't necessarily recommend reading it as a purchase.  Good from the library.
B0083Z6AH6|2.0|The wording was a bit too antique for my liking. The storyline was good but I was disappointed in this book.
B0072V394E|3.0|After seeing the new Django in the theater, I thought I'd watch the original.  Wow surprised.  I liked it even thought the story line was different. Thank Amazon Prime.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|I have no problem with the songs being as they are in the movie (it is a motion picture musical soundtrack, after all). I knew before I made my purchase that it was a highlights album. Still, I didn't realize \\"Look Down\\" wouldn't start from the beginning. I'm also very disappointed that \\"Do You Hear the People Sing\\" didn't make it. I'm looking forward to an actual soundtrack release with all of the songs, in full version, as well as background music.
B0030B624E|5.0|Have always loved this movie, as do my kids. Now I have it on my kindle for us to watch anywhere we want.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Ordered this last minute because it was not available on Netflix.<br />Prime shipped super fast and we were able to watch before Christmas.....made the wife very happy.<br />Good flic.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|A true fan will buy all of his music ,a real singer songwriter , always a truly  entertaining voice .
B0097EWK3A|4.0|this is a really good app. completely worth the money. Had a really good time playing the game. If yiuo<br /><br />you like hidden object games, buy this one
030758836X|5.0|I needed this book for a book club discussion and it arrived on time and I had plenty of time to get it read. It was in great condition.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Beautiful musics! Waiting for others CD or DVD.<br />Brilliant performances. So lovely!<br />Congratulations to Steve Sharp Nelson and Jon Schmidt.<br />My favorites instruments, piano and cello!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is good because this book has a lot of action. And the way it goes it makes you want to keep reading to see what happen. Especially during the games is when it gets real good. And just to let you know Peeta and katniss have kids in the next book:)
B004LWZWGA|2.0|The DVD does not work correctly.  No matter what we do we can not get the captioning to turn off- so there were words across the screen the entire movie.  The &#34;captioning off&#34; button never worked.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Had me reading all day and night. I wouldn't suggest this to younger kids (pre teens) though due to language and sexuality..
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is by far the best book I have ever read. I normally don't cry when I read books but this book really got to me. I would tell everybody who gets the chance to read this book to read it. You won't put it down.
B005HSL626|1.0|this stupid app won't let me open it and when i do open it it goes back to the home page its really irratating me,stupid app
B00A9X9ORI|1.0|I guess middle-aged women are not the target audience for this movie, but I was shocked at the overall good reviews.  I thought it was nonstop violence, and filled with characters who I didn't give a hoot about it.  Not worth watching.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I simply love this book.  I had already read Book 1 and this book lives up to my expectations.  Ordering Kindle books is fast and easy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its flexible with different calculation types. love the big buttons. i like that it displays the previous calculation under the answer line.
055380684X|5.0|I have just read some of the reviews and was honestly surprised to find anything negative??? To each his own... Here's my take: I've read the book four times now and am now working on my fifth... I have given it to my son's violin teacher: She has completely reworked the way she teaches. I gave it to my other son's piano teacher (concert level pianist): she has greatly altered the way she teaches. I have given a copy to a professional triathlete who is the director of a large training program: he has dramatically altered the way he approaches his program as well as his own personal training. I have given it to several different individuals who work extensively with youth (teachers, scout leaders, and others) and each of them have found great success as they have worked to incorporate these ideas (they have each told me so)... If there are academic contradictions or inconsistencies that derail you then that is unfortunate... From a practical perspective, if you in any way work with youth, teach, instruct others, or are working in improving any skill or ability, then this is a must read. It has positively influenced the way I run my business (heavily skill based with myself and my staff of over twenty), it has influenced the way I work with youth (in numerous capacities), and it has influenced the way I work with my own children in my home. If there are any shortcomings, they are far outweighed by the practical yet powerful insight it gives. It is truly one of he best books I've read. (PS -- I have actually given away over ten copies and was just logging on to buy five more) (PPS -- I mistakenly posted this as a response to another review so I am reposting it here so it doesn't get buried)
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|A good ending to a great series. Not as  good as the 2nd book but still a captivating read for all.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|The ads for this movie are the best parts. Pass on this movie, very over rated by the reviews here, lacks story line, typical earth at an end crime lords rule. Writing 20 words in order to simply give this one a one star.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I really like how this book is written ...it's not only a fascinating story, but it has the &#34;proof&#34; so to speak from the medical team that took care of Anita as she was going through this journey.  If you have ever wanted to know more about our existence here on earth and beyond, this is definitely a book you want to read.
B00782O7IY|1.0|Follow me, without sound...<br /><br />Man is good husband (unlike the lead character in 'The Artist').  He watches 'The Artist because wife wants him to.<br /><br />Man wants to grab about 4' of rope and tie a noose and attach to vaulted ceilings about twenty minutes into film.<br /><br />Man's desire to hang himself doesn't change after one hour and forty minutes.<br /><br />Now, with sound....<br /><br />I'm really happy that 'The Academy' deemed a film about an idiot who fell from grace, hated his wife, longed for an affair, drank too much, set his apartment on fire (unfortunately he and his annoying-as-hell Jack Russell Terrier were not tied to a wall while this was going on), and lived in self pity worthy of a Best Picture Award.<br /><br />All I can say is I was/am happy there wasn't a boom operator involved with this so I could hear these imbeciles actually speak.<br /><br />Just a complete embarrassment and verifies 'The Academy' has zero credibility (not that modern-day-Hollywood does, either).<br /><br />F-ing horrible.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Ice Age: Continental Drift was hilarious!!! I really enjoyed seeing the familiar characters again and it was nice to see a possible love interest for the sabertooth. Very fun movie
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|After reading a summary of what the book was about I was intrigued and was pleasantly surprised at how much the book drew me in.  I looked forward to my reading time every day.  The author put forth a complicated tale and pulled it together very well. I will read more from this author in the near future.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Love trying to get all the gnomes. I like how you can replay the levels. Fun graphics and character comments.
B0059GVBHG|5.0|There are a few stories being intertwined in this movie. Very gritty and very real! Jennifer Jason should have had an OSCAR for her performance.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|I like it. its just that the missions coulde be more difficult becuas I got to a beginner to a graduate in a day
B004DM0UII|5.0|I've been looking for a streaming app with timer functions and this works great. It also was able to locate one of my favorite radio stations that I couldn't  find in other streaming apps. Thanks!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book of the hunger games trilogy is bound to be as good as Hunger Games and Catching Fire!
B008VBYN80|4.0|So... this game isnt too bad. The fighting is neat.. It's a huge pain runnin out of energy tho and basically if you want to keep playing it you have to keep spending real money.. but if you just hop on for a few mins here and there.. it's an okay game
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is very easy to use pintrest. to post and repine photos are a breeze.  I will consider this to my friends
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|omigod I love this game so much! oh my gosh its so addicting and soooooo fun!!!!! I love it a lot
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Good book.  I really enjoyed it.  Better understanding of the afterlife thru the eyes of a previous unbeliever.<br />Would recommend it to others
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is sso addicting I love it sooooooo much the dragons are soooo cute and to all the idiots who by accident payed real money, your really dumb for getting mad at teamlava just because you didn't read the description
B007EECSFA|5.0|As usual, Kate Morton has written a spellbinder.  Her characters are finely drawn and the plot is intriguing.<br />I was completely astounded when the 'secret' was revealed.  I can only hope Ms. Morton will keep on writing for a long long time.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|good  mix of  new and past story lines. entertaining  Smith carries his character well  awaitinwell done follow waiting for men in black IV
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|ordered and a couple days later, wa-la here it is in the mail box.  Works as good as the original.<br />Love it and my Kindle!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|Laurel finds and learns all about her family history specifically surrounding her mum. The story is told through her Laurel, her mother and people in her mothers past. It mainly stretches over the war years in England during the second world war to the present day, unfolding mystery and secret around her mothers life.<br />The story has love, family, humour and historical facts woven in through the fictional story.<br />Great read, great story, I throughly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very fun but everyone is correct don't do the update. It's nice to see some old games in there and some interesting ones as well.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I loved this movie so much that I bought the book. It's an okay book but I was so sure that there was going to be a more detailed connection between the different stories that I was extremely disappointed. Besides the comet tattoo, there is very little connection and evolution of the characters. Maybe that wasn't the author's intent but from this reader's perspective, it could have been a much deeper and more meaningful book. I loved Mr. Mitchell's decision to let the Wachowski siblings make important changes to the movie. I'll buy the blue ray now and enjoy the behind the scenes sections.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|couldn't stop reading.  amazing ending totally unexpected. gave one much thought about how much we trust our children and how we handle this situation
B009O2XY12|3.0|I mean its okay but its the wick you no I mean why do we need wick to play a game and its asking too much money
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! It's silly fun that lets you be a bit creative as well. It makes you think but isn't horribly challenging, which is good for a nongamer like me.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Always the best from this group. One of the best shows on and hope they can continue for many more seasons to come.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Very relaxing and great idea going to many countries and capturing its beauty. Ive visited some of the locations and brings back great memories.
B004DM0UII|5.0|I've tried slacker, pandora, and xm/sirius. This blows them all away. Wide range of choices for stations and the search feature in case you want something different. So many cool features and it even has tutorials. Love, love, love this app!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Great fun. I really enjoyed this game. It's just hard enough to make you work for it but easy enough to still enjoy.
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|The entire book is one tech name-drop after another, with a basic plot and predictable ending. There are even grammatical mistakes in it - if you're going to publish a book at least edit it properly!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I like the game buts its a challenge. so its all good. its Mindanao funny to see your man running around. little complicated.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|I am a Maroon 5 fan and looked forward to this album.  I was not disappointed.  Song after song, it never stops entertaining.  I love listening to Adam Levine's voice.  The lyrics and the music are fantastic and stay in my head long after I've stopped listening to the CD, which I do often.  The last song on the Album is not original.  It's called Kiss and they do it in a bluesy kind of way.  The singing and the band are so incredible - I love the way they did this song!  I totally enjoyed the entire album and think that Maroon 5 never sounded better.  I saw a few bad reviews and I just don't get it.....at al!  I think this album should win the Grammy for best pop album.  If you're considering getting it, do it.  You'll love it!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really like it. The dragons are so cute! I just don't have enough friends to get gifts...but other than that its great.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I did not expect Soundgarden's new album being So Good. Since I have all their albums, so I just need to add this one to my CD collections. To my surprise, it really rocks. Very powerful and heavy, but pop. Sounds like Soundgarden in a different phase. I love it.
B003ASLJS6|5.0|Watched twice since Christmas. One of my favorite Clint Eastwood films.  Couldn't believe how fast it arrived.  It was a gift for my roommate and I was able to present it to them on Christmas eve, even though I ordered it only three days before,
B009ERK1T0|3.0|I've been a rock fun for more than forty years, and I like some deftones albums. Since Soundgarden released a fantastic new album, king Animal, I expected this would be another good new album from a veteran band. I found this sounds all the same and not any progress has been made from their past albums. Nothing new. Super mediocre, like they are doing routine job.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|From the first paragraph, this book had me eagerly anticipating each word, page and chapter. I could feel the emotions of each character; their anger, sorrow, happiness, and joy, just to name a few. Wonderfully well written. I never got bored, never wanted to skip a paragraph. Hopeless had twists I wasn't expecting. Colleen had me hanging on every word. If I could, I'd give Colleen Hoover a huge hug! Phenomenal book!!!<br /><br />It's not about the firsts, it's about the forevers!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I always like Preston and Child books and this one is no exception.  Pendergrast was his weird self and there was some back story on previous characters.  As usual for this team - a winner.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I strongly recommend this product, in fact i'm buying the second one for my other computer, it works really well!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was starting to get a little depressed with the last couple of books in this series with everybody getting killed but this book has reinstated my faith. Lol 5 out of 5. I highly recommend it
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Okay so based on the fact that this is based on Channing Tatums life it makes the story kinda interesting. Not to mention all the scenes where they're dancing is amazing. However would I buy this? NO. The story line was really weak and boring. Lets just say no one would have seen it if it didn't have half naked men dancing!!!
B00AE2J93I|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this, as did our 10 year old. Our 7 year old was frightened during many scenes. Great voices, good script.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|All the episodes make me laugh! I just love watching Jess and Schmidt...and of course Nick!!!! Can put this on anytime and even after already seeing it. I love it!
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 shades I think couldn't have been more &#34;real&#34; no red room of pain but plenty of other things going on lol
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Didn't have high expectations for this but I have to say I LOVE it! She really knows how to write songs! Definitely a keeper!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great I just a little longer I finished the book in a day = /<br /><br />I can't wait for the next book=)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Kids say its wonderful. Lots of fun. Hours of play. Makes for quick reflexes. Teaches to look ahead. Free is great
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Awesome show - different plot than season one, but same actors playing new characters. Looking forward to what they do for season 3.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|I thought the camera on the kindle would be a little better but its extremely grainy! The only good thing about this app is I can download photos from Facebook
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Omg omg omg I love this game so much I played it till two in the morning it is so fun
B003YHSE7W|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this sequel to Iron Man. It was as good as expected, but I would not recommend this movie for children under the age of 13.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Loved that it was written by a neuroscientist. I like to see the science and Spirituality work together. I really enjoyed this book and bought another that he recommends. Looking forward to a possible second book with more details of the experience in \\"heaven\\" and the things he learned.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I really didn't know much about Thor before watching this movie, but found this movie to be exciting and enjoyable...everything a super hero movie should be.
B00009YOQW|5.0|My one-year old loves this! We have certainly gotten our money out of this toy. Well constructed, great quality. What you would expect from Plan toys.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This installment of the Avengers series is exciting with an enjoyable plot. I highly recommend it to anyone over the age of 13 looking for a great super hero movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a new kindle fire owner, and this may be one of my first favorite apps. I love the look and the ease of use.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Both recipients are Big Bang Theory fans and they both liked it.  What's not to like - it's a great show.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  I play for hours. it stimulates the mind. it looks easy but it will make you think.
B004LWZW2E|5.0|Even with the movies low budget it scared me and my wife more than most big budget films ever have. Some of the special effects are a little cheesy but what do expect from a low budget film.
B00634GHJA|5.0|I Love This App. It's A Quick Easy Way To Transfer My Pics From My Phone To My Computer.  I Use It All The Time.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|I don't know why people hate on this movie. I found it met its purpose it entertained me and told me a good story. I would recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I also love the 3 disc option so I can watch it in any format I want to.
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|I have really enjoyed this game but I have gotten to place were it won't let me do the task needed. I have tried since last night. Getting really frustrated.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|If you watched and enjoyed Battlestar and didn't see it in HD and want to rewatch the series then buy this box set. I just wish the series hadn't ended so soon.
B008S4FZHI|5.0|Thank you so much for this story, it's like you had a brief holiday and now you're back with a vengeance. I've known you ( Kay Scarpetta, that is) & your &#34;family&#34; for so long, having read every Scarpetta novel and I think all of the other books, except the one about Billy Graham's wife, Ruth.  I love that you include the reader in everything you do, even the wonderful food you cook and the way you describe your home and garden, clothes, etc.<br />Please write another book soon - no-one compares to you at your best.<br /><br />Judy. (New South Wales, Australia).
0143035711|5.0|Well written. I could not stop reading. Would have liked to see more photos in the photo section of the book, just to put faces to all the names.<br />Interesting afterwords.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is better than the last three and has amazing game play and I highly recommend to those who like these types of games
B0091QSNEE|5.0|This is a great game.  I have 3 girls ages 5, 7 and 9.  All love it.  I also let my preschool students play on my tablet as a reward, once in a while.  The boys and girls all like this game.
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter is 4 and absolutely loves it. It's Monster High after all. Sturdy and durable enough to be played with by young kids. Some small parts that you have to watch with younger ones but overall a great toy.
B00A757EFW|2.0|This is a demo, not a lite version.  I wanted to get it for the kids figuring that if they played through the lite version, I would buy the full version.  You know kids.  They think they want something, you spend the money, and they really didn't want it that bad.  Lite versions are good for that.  If they like it enough to play through the lite version, it's worth the buy for the full one.  This one doesn't even let you finish level 2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book. I hope they make a movie for these books. These book change my life. Love it,
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is a great game.  I have 3 girls ages 5, 7 and 9.  All love it.  I also let my preschool students play on my tablet as a reward, once in a while.  The boys and girls all like this game. It's neat that you get to cure each patient with various medical tools.  It's fun and easy to understand even for the little ones.
B0090EIILU|1.0|The most stupid movie, not funny at all. Don't waste your money ordering this movie. Not funny at all. Not funny.
B0061S073A|4.0|choose the apps the kids can use, enter a password, and hand your tablet of phone to your kids.  They can't get out without a password.  They can't make purchases from the marketplace. I just wish there were profiles.  I would like to let my 9 year old have access to more apps than my 5 year old.  It also has crashed sometimes on my daughter's tablet.  But she has a cheap polaroid tablet from Big Lots and crashing apps are not completely uncommon.  I have had no trouble with this app on my d2 pad, the kindle fire, or my samsung galaxy or infuse phones.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|Increible.<br />LLego sin problemas.<br />Rapido. El arte del disco es muy bueno.<br />Y la musica ni hablar.<br />Musica tranquila y dulce para relajarse.
B0085YNML2|4.0|VERY, VERY cute.  Fun. Plays smoothly, good controls, great graphics.  only 4 stars because i find it frustrating at points where proper timing of jumps/drops are required.  I like the puzzle aspect and get frustrated when I figure out the puzzle, but my timing isn't good enough to get through the level.
B001MW0J2Y|4.0|Este disco de Frusciante es uno de mis preferidos.<br />El envio fue rapido y satifactorio<br />llego muy bien y sin problemas<br />Es un disco de Frusciante que recomiendo.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I love this game.  My 3 kids, ages 5, 7, and 9, love this game.  Old style 2-D super mario type game with really cute graphics and fun music.  My 7 year old walks around with her headphones on enjoying the music maybe even more than the game-play, but the game-play is REALLY fun. I think this is the current favorite game for all 4 of us girls.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Love this album! Perfect for in the car or wherever. An awesome mix of songs to jam out to and sing along with! Can't ask for more, especially for the $5.00 I paid for it!
B00A4YVHXQ|4.0|I like this game and so do my 7 and 9 year old girls.  The easy songs and some of the normal songs are good.  However, I have been playing piano since I was 9.  I am quite good, but this game is hard.  You must play 2 notes at a time, throughout some of the songs.  Maybe if I had an ipad with a bigger screen than my 7&#34; tablet, it wouldn't be so tough, but those keys are too small to hit 2 at a time accurately.  I haven't had the app for that long, so who knows what practice may bring.  This is just my initial impression.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This is a movie well worth your time. My wife and I have spent many hours viewing it time and again.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I like this a lot.  a little bit of adventure, a lot of puzzle, and beautiful scenery along the way.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Too funny....makes me believe a teddy bear can be real..<br />I really enjoyed it!<br />I watched it twice...you will too.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I am very happy with the delivery of the DVD. It took less time to get here then they said it would. As far as the quality of it then I'm not sure cause it was a Christmas present for someone that collects them and I don't think they have even opened it yet.
B002NXSRVG|5.0|I loved the concept. One actor didn't fit the part, but the others blended into a good cast. I hope the sequel is as good despite character changes.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This was a present for my wife and she loves the protection for her new Kindle. Thank you for offering it.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Though Hollywood made money on the fake Mayan prophecy, the action is almost nonstop. CGI very good. Characters are realistic. Mother Nature wreaks havoc.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|lovetthis, fast shipping
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Wonderful. The characters played off each other. The personal conflicts are realistic. Mark Raffalo acted well in the role of Hulk. He and Captain America have their moments. Battle sequences are fantastic, true to comic form.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|we loved the series and bought the DVD as a present. I am sure they will love it as well.
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I thought this book was amazing because it touches on how you see older people and it is easy to forget that they used to be young and had love and dreams, etc.  I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it as a great read!
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|Ted was an ok movie, but not worth 5 buck rental.  Wait for redbox or netflix and watch it for free
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this trilogy.  I really couldn't put them down once I started reading the books which is always a good sign for me.  I would highly recommend!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Incredible.  This guy experienced the most insane and well-publicized events in our war on terror, and came out on top.  This was a page turner book, well written.  The US Navy SEALs rock!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book!  Strong content with a closure ending (instead of a happy ending).  Strong characters.  Other books I liked: Beautiful Disaster, On the Island, and anything by Selena Kitt.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Very enjoyable reading......even inspired this 73 year old man to start running....needless to say had to start little by little.  Highly recommend it.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is great in graphic and it is easy to play and it keeps u busy for a long while.  The problem with this game is it freezes or slowed down so drastically that u cannot play unless u reset the game.  The timer does not really keeping the time. If u go to Princess Celestial land to look or place treasure trunk the number of days that you play feasts to 0.  Daily awards is the only mean to get GEMS to pass challenges. Without this u would need to pay minimum $50 real money to pass the game. Fix the FREEZES timer and day reset then this game shoud get 5 stars.
B001BNFR6W|5.0|All of the dvd's were in excellent condition and they arrived as expected. Thanks for making this such an easy purchase!
0143122010|5.0|This is an incredible, thought provoking book and Pinker supports his premise with impressive evidence.  Should be required reading for all.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|We are new to Lego building sets. Both of my daughters received a set for Christmas. My oldest (13) received the Space Shuttle. She has worked on it off and on for the past week and a half, and finally finished today! It is quite impressive! Even though she is not an experienced builder, she had no trouble working on it alone. She was a little frustrated that the sections weren't divided/numbered in bags (like her sister's set), but managed anyway. The set did have two missing pieces, that we ordered through Lego but luckily they weren't pieces that prevented her from continuing to build. (Lego makes it very easy to order missing pieces on their website; the only draw back is that it takes 2 weeks to get the parts.)<br />We will definitely continue buying Lego sets from now on. These sets have gotten my kids off the computer, away from the TV, and engaged. The finished products are so impressive and gives them a true feeling of accomplishment.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I never write reviews, but this cd is amazing. Never heard so much good music in one movie. There is only one song on the cd that isn't instrumental which I am not a huge fan of, but I really cannot say anything bad about this cd. I give this thing a 10/10 5 stars A+ .......doesn't matter how you want to put it this album is golden. It makes whatever you are doing seem epic.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The atmosphere of this book was electric! I think this is secretly a fantasy of many women.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Disapp<br />ointed.  Not as complex as the majhong game i have on my computer.  Needs alot more design choices. But still fun, especially for my 5 yo grandson.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|even my wife like`s this movie! It has no nudity in it but a lot of action and shooting in it!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|One of the best trilogies out there! Definitely a must buy! Go and get this set as soon as possible!
0753801728|4.0|I watched the movie before I read the book. That is never a smart move but it was especially dimwitted in this case. In my defense I didn't know the movie was based on a book. How did I not know that?<br /><br />The big secret wasn't so secret. I already knew the big reveal. It didn't ruin the book for me but I did read it from a different perspective since I knew what was coming.<br /><br />I don't know if I've ever felt more conflicted about a book. The relationship between Michael and Hanna is wrong in every way and yet there is something beautiful about it. Hanna's past actions cannot be excused and yet I felt pity for her.<br /><br />This slim volume is packed with big messages. There isn't much more that I can say without laying out a bunch of spoilers. I don't want to do that. If you haven't read this you should. Take a bit of advice? Don't see the movie first.<br /><br />Jennifer @ The Relentless Reader
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I have never played any of the games from Persona series and I have been missing out. This game offers you a lot of game time because you decide what to do with your time. You can either build more social interactions, join clubs, study for midterms and finals, catch up on some reading. The main part of the game is solving a mystery that is going around town with your friends. I guarantee you that this game is a must buy for the vita and is worth the $40.
B004DM0UII|2.0|Thanks Amazon for making this app free today, but it's not worth it. I was intrigued by the equalizer, but you really can't tell THAT much of a difference on the Samsung Epic. The streaming is choppy (cuts out every 5-10 sec), and the app slows down other apps, e.g. words lag when typing on Tweetcaster.<br /><br />I also am confused and perhaps somewhat overwhelmed by what station to choose. The stations listed are the actual station names but don't really have a good description. You just have to assume the stations will play within the genre. I definitely prefer Pandora, which plays the next song based on songs you like and stays within the genre (or you can create your own station). The streaming on Pandora also isn't choppy. Maybe others have had better luck with this app, but I've already uninstalled it from my phone.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was amazing, there were so many life lessons and inspiring quotes that I connected to my own life. This book definitely had an impact on my teenage life
B009JBZH54|5.0|GET THIS! Or u will regret it. This is a must have for Batman fans who love blu ray movies.
B005HS00V4|5.0|Very good dvd. Good to see Peter,Gabriel. Hope to see him on the road touring the US. . Good dvd
B003M2DWE4|5.0|We decided that it was time to give our 8 year old his own alarm clock to get ready for school in the morning. My boys love Legos so this was a perfect fit. It has an alarm with off and on button, the backlight only comes on when you mess with it, so it isn't a bright light in his room all night. It is a battery only device, but it comes with batteries already installed. We love this item and if I had to do it again, I would totally buy it again and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|After I downloaded this product, I started haveing problems with my tablet.  I took it off and all the problems I was having went away.
0812993357|4.0|I fell in love with Grace in The September Issue and this book definitely doesn't disappoint. Lots of great scoop on her life and time at Vogue.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A definite page turner! I purchased the first book only, but I am definitely going for the other two soon!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|what do expect from a game made by the same company that made cut the rope and cut the rope experiments
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was not expecting much when I started this book. It sure did surprise me. I laughed, cried and stopped reading a few to<br />Especially to tell my husband how much I love him.<br />Will definitely keep this one in my library.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I bought PETER PAN as a gift for my five year old grandson. It's his favorite movie. Lots of adventure and not too scary.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game kind of feels like blackops2.the multiplayer is great and I love the campaign and the fact that you can play as the bad g it too is awesome.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Bought this for my seven year old grandaughter who loves horses.  Good movie.  No problems, just as described.  She loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is one of the greatest book ever written.  I latterly couldn't stop reading. I love all the discriptions

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Memorable deep honest and heart wrenching.  The characters are dynamic funny and infinitely endearing.  Didn't want it to end one of the best books I've ever read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book cant wait to read the next. I've finished the first two in a week and I'm not a reader
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I needed to set up my Mac Mini as a file server, connecting to an iSCSI RAID drive made by Drobo (a DroboPro to be precise).  To do so, I needed to add another ethernet port to my Mini, so that I could have one port for connecting the Drobo, and one for talking to the network.  To address this issue, I looked in to the Thunderbolt Ethernet adaptor from Apple.  Unfortunately, no information that I could find would confirm that these adaptors would work with anything other than MacBook Airs.  As such, I decided to take a chance, try it out on my Mini, and if it worked great, if not, I would return it.<br /><br />I purchased it and waited for it to arrive.  Once it arrived, I immediately plugged it in to the Mini.  Unfortunately, nothing changed in the Network Interface list in Network System Preferences...Darn - maybe it isn't supported....I thought.  It also seemed very loose when plugged in to the port, much looser than a mini-display port adaptor.  That seemed strange due to the fact that they were the same size plug.<br /><br />For the longest time, I couldn't realize why the Mac Mini would not recognize the presence of the adapter, while when used on my MacBook Pro it was recognized perfectly.  Eventually, I placed a light back in the networking closet and realized that the adaptor wasn't pushed in all the way!  Once I pushed in the adaptor all the way, it worked perfectly on my Mac Mini running Mac OS X 10.8.  It was recognized instantly and the thunderbolt ethernet port automatically appeared in the network system preferences.<br /><br />I now have a connection to the Drobo RAID array that is at least 3x faster than before.  This is a great little adaptor for use in Mac Mini computers running OS X.<br /><br />Highly Recommended, just make sure to push it in all the way, with a little more force than you might think is needed.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I rate this book a 5 because it shows a amount of words that people can find. It helps people with know wat the consepe

B0091VTNZC|5.0|Great movie. Ranks right up with Christmas Vacation as a must see during the holidays. Streaming quality awesome. Highly recommend.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved it, it always kept you wanting more. I just couldn't put it down. The excitement,and thrill,and wanting to know what was gonna happen next. I loved it I think everyone should read it the book is always better.
B001KVZ6HK|3.0|I absolutely love the movie, but don't rely on getting your digital copy, digital album, digital comic, and poster.  I've tried and tried to redeem my code and used the customer service form on AvengersAssembleOffer.com multiple times with no response.  If you were thinking of upgrading for these bonuses, I'd stick to the two-disc version.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was an awesome book. The description was great and the plot and characters made it so hard to ever put the book down! I'd recommend this book to anyone who is looking for Dr p and fascinating book to read
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is well thought out and the viewer gets sucked into the lives of those who must deal with a world full of flesh-eating zombies.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn had me going until the very end of the book, and then, when I thought I had it all figured out, managed to surprise me. The two main characters are portrayed beautifully and not sugar coated in any way. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery and psychological thriller.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book pulled me in from the first page.  It tells in often graphic details the conditions of life for slaves and masters in Southern America.  The story is familiar to those who have explored the slave/master relationship and the attitude of white owners towards their African &#34;property.&#34;  Even so, it startles me to read about daily life among the slaves even as it sickens me to know that white people were capable of treating others with such disregard and with such cruelty.  As a southern, I am ashamed of my ancestors and still I am intrigued by this part of our history.  As I read The Kitchen House I tried to relate conditions then for the Africans to current conditions for immigrants in our country.  The US is a great country but it's so apparent that we can all do better.  I highly recommend this book as a lesson in how far we've come and a reminder that we have a ways to go.  Very well written.  The characters continue to live with me.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love games like this. It not to hard but not easy either. I would recommend it to all my friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing books I've read.  You will feel many different emotions as you turn the pages and begin to wonder who the characters really are.  In a nutshell, you should read this book!
1423140605|5.0|All three of these books are good.  Worth the read.  Waiting for the next one to come out. Have liked all of the books by this auther.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Great book!  Holds your attention right up to end and then hits you with a zinger!  You will become a member of the family if you're not careful.  This book stays with you for awhile.
0670026182|5.0|Just ordered my 2nd copy today as I gave my first one to a friend that loved it.  Great book , pictures make your mouth water looking at them. Easy to follow recipes and taste wonderful.  I may order a few more for more as gifts. Looking for to Katie's next book
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The movie was long (again) while taking its time to develop the plot lines. The villain was not as interesting as the Joker in the Dark Knight, and we rehashed an old plot by an old enemy.  The Cat Woman was done well and the character was interesting and entertaining. The setup at the end for another movie in the series will surely keep blogs humming until the next incarnation of the Batman on the big screen. There was excessive violence and killing with little need for it, the story could have been done with less.  3 stars because its always fun to see the Batman on the movie screen, but with the storyline being rehashed from past movies, it did not wow me.
B00A757EFW|1.0|this app is not good It does not work on my divce if I spelled some words. wrong I'm sorry I'm not a good. speller
1250006341|5.0|This is a very interesting book for those that enjoy Downton Abbey.  Has a lot of information regarding actors, Highclere, and especially interesting is the information regarding the Edwardian era.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|There are tons of great levels and modes of play.  They are challenging and fund to play and great for the whole family.
B008RZHAAS|5.0|My DH asked for this CD on his Xmas gift list, so I got it for him. He says that it is his favorite album -- EVER -- and that every time he listens to it, he hears some new nuance while revisiting old favorites. The tracks are supple, inventive, and extraordinarily well done. It's the kind of music that if you don't know what's playing you want to know who it is right now so that you can immediately rush out and get it.
0380730405|4.0|I had seen the film so many times that I decided that it was time to read the book.  I enjoyed the book as much as the film.  I am looking forward to reading more of Du Maurier's work.

B000I62JAK|2.0|More like Snoozlander.  Nothing funny here, folks.  Move along.  I have 11 more words but I honestly can't think of a way to fill them as this movie was as vapid as the industry it tries to make fun of.
B007CI81IQ|5.0|This book deserves to become a classic of development literature. In my studies, I have read many hundreds of thousands of pages on development economics and associated questions about poverty and this three-hundred page book trumps them all in terms of addressing the question of what can actually be done.<br /><br />This book sets itself up in stark contrast to the approaches of both Sachs and Easterly. At first glance, these two economists may appear utterly different. Sachs (best known for[[ASIN:0143036580 The End of Poverty: Economic Possibilities for Our Time]]) believes that all problems of poverty can be solved with sufficient hand-outs. Easterly (best known for [[ASIN:0143038826 The White Man's Burden: Why the West's Efforts to Aid the Rest Have Done So Much Ill and So Little Good]]) despises hand-outs and believes the developed world needs to back-off. The panacea, according to Easterly, is free markets.<br /><br />Banerjee and Duflo argue that both these eminent economists make the mistake of focusing too much on the big questions. They argue that it is the small ones that matter. Both the philosophy and methodology they advocate is based on a simple premise: details matter. As they put it, \\"Attend to the details, understand the how people decide, and be willing to experiment.\\"<br /><br />In terms of philosophy, they argue for an incrementalist or a marginalist approach and demonstrate how much can actually be done when we get the details right. In terms of methodology, they urge the reader to turn from the BIG questions - governments versus markets, aid or no aid - and focus on an empirical approach using \\"randomised controlled trials\\" (\\"RCTs\\") to ascertain what works and what does not in addressing the challenges faced by the poor.<br /><br />They examine poverty from all angles - looking at health, education, micro-credit, savings and insurance, entrepreneurs - and always they focus on the details. They stay away from sweeping statements (\\"the poor need credit\\", \\"micro-credit solves everything\\", \\"access to markets solve everything\\", \\"conditionality is critical for grant-giving\\", \\"democracy is non-negotiable\\") and they focus on the evidence. What do the poor actually do? What decisions do they make? What changes their decisions?<br /><br />This book is a gold-mine of insights. Perhaps one of the most important is that the poor are not all that different from the rich. The same \\"time inconsistency\\" bias that causes the rich to renege on their commitments to regularly attend gym plays a role in the poor failing to effectively immunise their children. The authors also show how much the rich benefit from the invisible paternalism that pervades our lives and in how many ways, the lack of this affects the poor. They point out that the same desperation for a cure that drives the poor to both doctors and traditional healers, also drives the rich to consult alternative medical practitioners when faced by an incurable disease.<br /><br />They examine where poverty traps exist and where they do not, and what kinds of interventions actually assist people to escape these traps. They look at where the poor lack good information - for instance, they look at the beliefs the poor hold about the benefits to education. They argue that most policies are stymied by the \\"three I's\\" of Ideology, Ignorance and Inertia, which result in policies being badly designed and never altered, rather than by corruption or endemic failure.<br /><br />This is a powerful, insightful and, ultimately, radical book that challenges all the traditional approaches to understanding poverty and the poor. It shows an alternative path to widespread revolution or massive amounts of money being pumped in to save the poor. Instead, it urges us to look at the details and figure out what incremental changes need to be made. They argue \\"These changes will be incremental, but they will sustain and build on themselves.

B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Brisingr was one of the best reads I've had in quite the while. It focused on both the action and the more political elements simultaneously, which allowed for a much richer storyline. Installation the purchase. 9.5/10
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I love the game. I play with my girls. However, I have to revise my original 5 star review because the game has reset me to level 43 over 10 times. I will make progress, and then it will revert back to level 43 and all of my progress will be gone. I have contacted Gameloft, but haven't gotten any response. I feel like I can't buy gems, because they will disappear when the game resets. It is very frustrating.
0345529057|5.0|I started reading the A Song of Ice and Fire series after watching the first season and a half of HBO's series. I grew tired of waiting to find out what happened and figured I could get into it more by reading. I purchased A Game of Thrones separately and read that in its entirety before deciding to get the remaining books in the series. I have just finished the last remaining book A Feast for Crows and am now on to A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />This collection is great for any fan of fantasy and the Game of Thrones HBO series. It's fairly evident that the author can create a detailed picture and make you feel like you're actually in the minds of the characters. The books are easier to follow than the HBO series given that each &#34;chapter&#34; is dedicated to a specific character. Each book follows a few characters and several characters remain constants throughout the series.<br /><br />Great twists and no one is ever safe. The author makes it known that anything can happen to anyone at anytime. This is a great change from the &#34;the hero will always find a way&#34; mentality. Four books in I have no idea how this one is going to play out and it keeps me coming back for more everytime.<br /><br />A Feast For Crows Note: I've heard lots of people complain about AFFC due to it's change in pace and characters that it follows. Without going into too much detail, I will say that it does get rather slow at times, but after finishing that book I appreciated what the author did. It helped round out some of the characters you had only heard of through other characters' interactions. The first page of A Dance With Dragons explains his motive for writing AFFC in the manner he did and helps set you up for reading ADWD.<br /><br />It's been a long time (if ever) that I've been this captivated by reading, and I'd honestly recommend this to anyone who likes the fantasy genre.
B007SGM084|5.0|E L James' books are so god damn addictive you can't put it down. I  spent the whole weekend reading these books only stopping to eat, sleep, drink, and use  the bathroom. E L James is awesome!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is the best one yet! Jeff Kinney has done it again. It is a story of love, romance, and hilarious adventure. I strongly suggest reading it. It dose not take that long to read and it is good for everyone looking for a quick read. I personally like the dance part. I have always enjoyed reading his books and I like his pictures a lot. Good job Jeff Kinney!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|this is a very good game but the thing that gets me so mad is the bugs. there is one where after you play a multiplayer game you may have 10k $ but then when you exit you only have about 9k $ then when you buy some thing for 5k you only have 1k left. I think the game is great but because of these bugs it isn't as fun because its really hard to get cash.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|I choose this rating because I like this artist. She has a great voice. I like the music. I bought her first track &#34;Ready Or Not&#34; and loved it. Then I bought the album and loved the music.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|If you are into the whole controlling, possessive boy thing, then this is your dream book. I gave it 3 stars b/c it did keep my attention wondering if they would end up together. I won't spoil it, but some of the story line is over dramatic. I wouldn't think this book is for young people b/c it romanticizes dysfunctional relationships. Some immature young people will think Travis's behavior is acceptable & even romantic love.<br />That being said I found the book okay, but wouldn't read it again.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|this game is fantastic you can keep playing for hours, I would recommend this to people who are bored and just want a game that's entertaining. enjoy.
B005544V6A|5.0|Witty and just plain good.  Also have season 2 which is also very good and am looking forward to season 3 soon.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is so much fun! Not difficult, or glitchy. Works great on the kindle fire, you build your own dragon park and raise dragons by breeding them to make wonderful creatures! Buy decorations, eggs, buildings even another island for a second park! Love dragons? Then you will love this cute fun game to add to your app list!
B00335EQ0E|4.0|Disney tries to turn a bitter satire into a fantasy escape movie that you could watch on a cold, cold day in winter. But even Disney can't erase the incidents in the story that were put there by Lewis Carroll. When the Mad hatter wants to have a tea party on the ceiling it shows that he has no respect for Victorian mores. When the Rabbit dashes past Alice saying, \\"I'm late, I'm late for a very important date,\\" Disney can't change the satiric reference to the so-called established order of Victorian society where every respectable person is supposed to be somewhere on time. The Queen of Hearts is perhaps the most satiric figure. Someone who yells, \\"Off with their heads!\\" has no place in a Disney film, which at that point turns into a dark nightmare as the cards chase Alice and her friends until Alice finally wakes up and finds herself back home. The nightmare quality of the ending shows what seamy depths lay under the facade of calm and order of mid-nineteenth century society in Great Britain.[[ASIN:0141197307 Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland: With Artwork by Yayoi Kusama (Penguin Classics)]]<br />by Linda Cargill, author of Key to Lawrence
B008I34ZFW|4.0|An entertaining, if somewhat erratic, farce in which the denizens of the Third Reich set up their own \\"Fourth Reich\\" on the dark side of the moon after losing World War II.  Now it is 2019 (50 years after man first landed on the moon) and Americans return to moon to prospect to Helium 3 only to find the Nazi moon base.  Before they can report back to Earth, they are captured by the Nazis and taken prisoner.  This encounter triggers the Nazi's long planned attack on Earth--a dream come true for a Palinesque American President whose dream is a popular war to insure her re-election!<br /><br />The films makers make good use of Wagnerian Themes, one of which I recognize from the opera Tannhaeuser.  The tune from the German patriotic song \\"Die Wacht am Rhein\\" is provided with new words to fashion the national anthem for the Moon Nazis.  I also thought that the name \\"Goetterdaemmerung\\" (Twilight of the Gods--that is, the End of the World) was an appropriate name for the Nazi's most impressive weapon.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I enjoy playing but, I wish there were a way to find hints WHILE in the game.  Other than thar, it's great.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Before I had the chance to read this book I'll admit to having a broken suicidal outlook but the more I read through, the more and more I felt an acceptance to what I've felt I've known but am just first coming across. I would recommend this book to anyone skeptical, curious, or in denial of an after life.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|There are no shootings, no bombs going off, no &#34;action&#34; in this film. It is a great movie about getting older. I think the target audience would be 50+. It is a little predictable but still the decisions made in the film are what we must all face eventually. Do you do your life with daring or do you just become sheep in an &#34;adult living facility&#34;.  I'm afraid India would be my last pick for a retirement home, however. It might be slightly above Bangladesh.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|Having just bought an Asus TF700, I discovered I bought A LOT of Kindle Fire games that I now can't use since they're only compatible with the KF.  SOOOO, I have to buy them again on Google Play.  Game is fun in and of itself, but I will no longer buy Amazon games; my jailbroke KF like Google Play games just fine.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|i feel this is a really good movie. its humorous and family friendly. they truly brought out the best of Dr. Seuss.
B000NQRE1E|4.0|Good BluRay, but I had to take away 1 star because Jack dies at the end... I'll never let go Jack... I'll never let go....
B003X7MCGW|2.0|Not a big live album fan to begin w/, this one does nothing to help that. Some live albums I have and like but not so impressed here.
B006BOT28U|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  In fact, I am impressed on how unpopular it is.  This book is the core thinking process of Eliyahu Goldratt and it is overlooked dramatically. It is his thinking processes that one that allowed him to write The Goal and we still overlook it.<br /><br />Caveat:  This is a more complicated book than The Goal by far. It is fool of paradoxes, examples, knowledge and tools.  However, none of the tools are easy to implement and require intuition, perseverance, listening skills and PRACTICE; therefore, I think i know why it is not as popular as the more prescriptive book The Goal.
B0013LKFVO|1.0|I bought 3 of them, not one of them worked.  I tried them in several flashlights.  Do not buy!  This should be rated 0.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I love talking friends but  every time I download one they ask me to download really weird stuff and if pick the choice later they won't let my play the app I tried talking pierre the parrot and talking Ben but none of them worked so I deleted them(the apps) don't recommend this app SUCKS if they wouldn't ask me to download weird stuff I would've gave it 5 stars
B006H5120E|5.0|I ordered this movie in 3-D due to the reviews I've read . Let me tell you ,of all my 3-D movies I own, this is one of the best use of the 3-D media I have ever seen. Many of the shots are just breath taking. I could be wrong but at the beginning of the movie they incorporated some footage from the movie Ghost of the Abyss and seeing the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean in 3-D was jaw dropping.The movie is broken into 2 parts, Disc 1 . One a love story, two Disc 2 , a disaster thriller. Both parts are about as good as it gets. This for me is a real keeper. One note , the first time I went to watch it, it began freezing on parts of disc 1. I tried to contact the movie company with no luck, so I contacted Amazon customer service for help. The person I spoke to was great, when I explained my problem , he made arrangments to have the movie replaced.To that I say Thanks.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|Although this movie takes great license with Pres. Lincoln's life, they weave it in such a way as to make you believe that if Vampires did exist, it would be spot on. Arrived early and was in the shape stated. Would definitely buy again!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I would have to say that I loved this book and I can't wait to start reading the new book third wheel. Honestly if you like short and easy to read books I would highly recommend this book!! No lie!! Best book so far but who says third wheel won't be even better!! :P lol!! I hope you like this book!!
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I have installed two of these now, each holding an additional monitor on either side of an iMac desktop.<br /><br />The Flex Arm comes set up to attach to the edge of a table -- thin and thick tables should work fine as the gap between the pressure plate and the base can be opened to as wide as about 2\\".  Other hardware is included so that you can mount this through a hole in a table surface if you wish--the instructions show how to do either.  And the mounting hardware is also included for both 75mm and 100mm standard plate sizes on the back of your monitor(s).<br /><br />The arm has multiple flex points and allows you to change your monitor for either vertical or horizontal use.  A couple different Allen wrenches are included to loosen and tighten the joints.  A key point -- and perhaps I am the only one who missed this- but the main height adjustment is accomplished NOT by loosening or tightening a key nut or two, but by pushing in the main, round hub on the main joint.  Push it in and you can easily raise and lower your monitor quickly.  When you release this joint button, the joint locks in that position. Dumb me! Spent way too much time trying to loose nuts to raise and lower when I just needed to press that spring loaded button.<br /><br />The swivel at the base is great.  The joints that are not designed for repeated adjustment are up next to the monitor where you would make more minor, or fine adjustments-- those two joints are probably best if not changed often.<br /><br />So--if you need to make frequent small changes this may not be for you.  But if you can set and leave the minor adjustments, and use the swivel base to rotate and the push button hub to raise and lower the arm, then this is a great product at a great price.<br /><br />As other reviewers mentioned, the little plastic loops designed to hold your monitor cables are pretty worthless as they fall out if the cables pull on them at all.<br /><br />With those qualifiers, this can be a great product, and I love getting my desk surface back without spending hundreds of dollars for a monitor support.<br /><br />Hope this helps with your decision making...
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I liked DVD better than watching it on Netflix because the DVD includes all scenes (Netflix must have shortened it some).  This is really the best drama, love story, and acting I have ever seen.  The actors are heavy weights and are just outstanding; the filming was so well-done, and the music was gorgeous.  I am not one for watching movies over and over again, but North and South is an exception for me -- I have already watched it 5 times.  LOVE it!!!
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I loved this movie but still have not yet received my DVD - I thought it was one of the best movies of 2012.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my first self-published purchase from Amazon, and the single best reading experience for quite some time. I am not surprised the writer later on has secured a book deal, and that Ridley Scott has picked up the movie rights (an interesting prospect in itself).<br /><br />Hugh Howey paints the most fascinating picture of this contained world. The more I know about it, the more compellef it is. In addition, the story is exciting in itself, and the characters and descriptions are all exceptional.<br /><br />I rarely stumble over a book that I keep on thinking about (in positive manners) for such a long time after I've finished it. Such a good read. Make sure you get to experience it before it's a well known Hollywood blockbuster.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app has nothing wrong with it and is fast and efficient. I love Facebook and I love this app I rate it five stars.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|British Version vs PBS: Don't sweat it. Just extra footage in British version. Well worth it to get Seasons 1 & 2
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read this novel after read book 1 \\"Bared to You\\". I could not put it down! This book has a great but stocking ending and my excitement builds as I wait for the 3rd novel to come out.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift by he recipient loves it. Turns out it has 3 DVD's with many series on each. Great deal for the price. Hard time finding it but, as always, Amazon did.
B006LSZECO|3.0|My sister-in-law told me she had read this over the holidays and it was a 'crime' novel - so I decided to check it out.  I downloaded the 'free' content and was hooked from the beginning.  The plot of a wife going missing and a husband left behind to figure it out was intriguing.  It was cleverly written from the wife's perspective beginning at the onset of their courtship and alternating to the husband's perspective beginning the morning of the disappearance.  As these two perspectives began to merge chronologically, the suspense was incredible.<br /><br />That being said, once the two joined and the book takes a twist (interesting twist, too) - the plot started becoming unrealistic.  There were many twists and turns, as both the husband and wife's perspectives are continuing to alternate, some of them are forced and not very believable.<br /><br />I won't spoil the book by mentioning anything about the ending - but it was very disappointing.  I kept waiting for the craziness of the plot to somehow come together to actually make sense - but it does not - and you're left feeling the author just couldn't get it figured out either so just ended the book at a 'good' stopping point.<br /><br />If you want a read that will keep you wanting to pick up the book - this works.  However, if you want a book that makes you think and ponder afterwards - and truly reflect on the characters and their plight - this will not.  It only makes you reflect on 'what was the author thinking.'
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Fascinating tale bringing together elements of previous novels.  If you are a fan of Preston Child work, you.ll LOVE this one!
B005O7OC6C|5.0|This Q & A Five Year Journal is such a great idea!  I saw a few of these (there are different versions) for the first time a few weeks ago and then I was given this one for Christmas.  I could not WAIT to start it.  You don't have to start it on January 1st but since I got it on Christmas I decided to wait until the New Year to start it.<br /><br />Each day you are asked a question, January 1st is \\"What is your mission?\\" and then there are five blank groupings below it with four lines for each year.  There is a blank 20__ for you to fill out the year.  I love the idea of seeing how you have grown through the years and what was important one year may not be the same the next year.  This is a great book for those who have a hard time keeping a journal, like me, and this way you are able to see year to year.  I love the idea of being able to see what you wrote the next year.<br /><br />Now, it is small.  There are not a lot of lines so you cannot write a novel but I really like the size that it is.  It isn't meant to be huge and if you were a journal writer you would need more than the four lines.<br /><br />I look forward to answering the question and writing in it each day!
B000IDGDPA|5.0|what a delightful movie. Characters are beautifully developed. Scarlett J is wonderful. Nice to Helen Hunt again. Incredible setting. Interesting plot. I don\\"t know how I hadn't heard anything about this movie. A refreshing and nicely paced movie. Highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just save yourself some time and get the last two book together. And clear your schedule after this one because you'll be compulsed to keep reading.
630460291X|4.0|I really like this movie , it's a good movie, had it on VHS and want it on DVD to watch whenever I want.  Some movies you just have to buy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it plenty of games to choose from very easy to unlock games. a lot of games to choose from and its free which is always a plus.
B00ABXA1HI|4.0|Using this I can wirelessly stream a non-full-screen Win7.64 Windows Media Center screen downstairs up to my HTC Droid DNA and from there pass it forward via a MHL adapter to the TV set in our bedroom.  Not quite as good as being there, but good enough to actually use.  But be careful when the connection goes to sleep or you will get a lot of noisy static that can wake you up. :-)<br /><br />Truely 1080p video can get a bit blocky, but 720p works just fine.  1080p would probably work just fine if the other computer had a wired 1 gbps connection.<br /><br />Using this I get a good FHD RemoteDesktop experience as well (assuming an in-house network connection).  It does pass thru the mouse, but there can be a delay (at least with a bluetooth mouse) that can be quite annoying.  I prefer the TrackPad mode instead. You essentially use the phone as a trackpad for your remote computer.<br /><br />It can take multiple attempts to establish or restablish your connection, but eventually it has always worked so far.<br /><br />Controlling a remote desktop over an internet connection (even a super fast 24mpbs+ up/down on each end) however is suprisingly slow.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|Wonderful deal on a great classic. My daughter in law had shared this $1.00 free deal with me. Couldn't ask for better.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Cute story, loved both characters!<br /><br />Liked the Vegas beginning something like this could happen there.  Will read this author again.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|A disappointing bore.  Turgid, passive prose.  I could not finish reading this book, and wished I hadn't wasted my money. Recommend that you save yours.
B005LAIHZY|2.0|No matter how trite the representation is (she's breaking free from the constraints of traditional roles, literally, bursting out of her ladylike outfit as she looses arrows) people will make excuses for this ham-fisted feminism because they're determined to play counter to traditional Disney princesses. The problem is this movie has zero of the charm of movies like Snow White, none of the fun characters, ridiculous 'According to Jim'-like portrayals of the majority of males, and an incredible lack of a real powerful villain such as we saw in past movies like Little Mermaid. It's too bad as it wastes Pixar's best visual effort, full of sprawling landscapes and great rendering on the main character's wild hair. After the mess of Cars 2 (and Cars 1 for that matter) it's unfortunate that Pixar is going in the wrong direction, but hey at least now people can stop whining that they haven't had a female lead in any of their movies.
B00846REIS|5.0|First book I have read from Sylvia Day and enjoyed this book from page one. It is definitely a must read!

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Amazing books! Far more than I expected when I started reading them. It keeps you on edge from page 1.
B004K4IZ54|3.0|The storyline like substance, the visuals are okay, but if you're buying it for the 3-D; most of the Scenes are not converted, defeating the purpose.  If you compare to other 3-D new releases, this fall short completely.  I have a Samsung that converts 2-D to 3-D, use that in addition and you'll be ok.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|you will enjoy playing this game,  it will take you back playing at the carnival,  l find myself playing for hours u will too.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love Where's My Perry .  I also like the new  reverse in Doofensmers one like Where's My Perry .They both are awesome.
B003LWN8F8|5.0|The lyrics are fun & quirky and I like her voice. I enjoy listening to this album occasionally but I don't love all the tracks.
B006RUJST6|2.0|I started out liking this book, even though the way the two characters met and bonded was awfully fast, which gave it an unrealistic edge. Then the book just got so depressing that I literally could not finish it. Which was annoying as part of me wanted to but I just couldn't stay on the morose sinking ship that is this novel......Lots and lots of dying people - not fun!
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Also a present, loved by the owner, i can only handle it for a little while but purchase was great...
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Hands down the scariest movie I've ever seen. I'm a horror movie fanatic, and this is one I almost couldn't watch. It's certainly a different type of horror, this one will really get you if you believe in demons & the spiritual world. That alone would be enough, but the atmosphere of the movie makes it all the more scary. This isn't a movie which aims to build your anticipation and have something jump out of nowhere when you are both expecting it & not expecting it. Oh no, this movie goes much deeper. You'll never expect what's in store for you, things will happen in this movie and you'll never see it coming.<br /><br />The music, really the one song played throughout, is more than creepy by itself. At the climax of the movie when the song is played, I wanted to throw up. I have never been so scared in my life by a movie, and I don't think anything could ever top that scene. It was done brilliantly & done like that for a reason.<br /><br />It was more than refreshing to have a movie be scary because it was truly just that. This proves there isn't a need for sex, boobs, serial killers, or incredibly vulgar language to have your audience scared.
B0000TB014|5.0|Bought as a present and even though it came after Christmas was still a great purchase, love the dvd. Awesome!!!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I actually really liked this movie. It was exactly as expected, cute & funny. Yes, it was a bit predictable..let's be honest here, most chick flicks are. I don't think there were too many characters, because the plot isn't confusing or complicated in any way. So yes, it's a typical girly movie but it has the elements that make it just that & that's why it's so enjoyable. Sometimes you don't want to watch a movie you really have to think in, so this one is nice to pile up on the couch after a long week and just enjoy the moment.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Unpredictable and entertaining!<br />Everytime I think I've figured out what is going to happen next I am surprised.<br />I gave this show five stars because I love a good horror story and this is a good one.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This app functions and looks wonderful. It has a wide variety of different types of music to choose from and everything starts up quick. It also follows the holo style guidelines set forth by android, which looks wonderful and makes the app look like it just belongs. Also, it sounds clearer than slacker and I like listening to the great stations from the big cities and international radio stations.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I.enjoyed the unfolding of the story and character development. Legal aspects were very interesting. Overall, an enjoyable read. Easy to identify with the characters and their ups and downs.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I do not read a lot of traditional science fiction but once in a while a title will catch my attention and I will read it. Such was the case with \\"Wool\\" and I am so glad that I read it! This book is great; it is exciting, well-written and engrossing. Part 1 can be read as a standalone short story and is fantastic as such. However, if you are in the least intrigued by the world you see in that story, then I highly recommend continuing on with the full 5-part story. Parts 2-5 cannot be read without first reading part 1, nor can any of them be read as standalone. They really fit together as parts of a single story. Part 2 is good but not as exciting as parts 1 and 3-5. It is more there to set the stage for the final three sections. I cannot say enough good things about this book. And yes, I personally think of it as more a single book than as 5 separate ones, since only part 1 can stand by itself. It's more like a serial publication. I highly recommend this to readers of any and all genres. I don't think you have to be a fan of science fiction to enjoy this book. A word of warning about the audiobook, however. I do not recommend it at all. The reader is a terrible fit for the story. She would be better suited to a young adult book as she sounds about 16!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've always believed there was a creator.  It's much easier to believe that than to believe that all of this (including us) was created at random.  When a secular, science based neurosurgeon has a near death experience and sees heaven for himself and attempts to describe it, as he does in this book, it is hard not to believe.  I know my faith has been strengthened greatly by this book.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who may be on the fence of believing if there is a god.
B007NZQU72|3.0|This book was really interesting for the first few chapters, but then I thought it became a little ridiculous.  I have had problems with being highly sensitive all my life, but this account of how to cope with that goes a little overboard. It's still worth reading, you just may feel like skipping around a little.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is my favorite game. I used to have it on my cell and was so happy to find it for my kindle. Great time filler.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|This film was entertaining but i thought it was more for younger people. Older adults should stick to the Classics Like the Alien series
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a really fun game for all ages. You have to get to get your coins to get other games by playing games. Some games are harder but, you get awards for finishing like a whole page of games, or trying to win a game five times in a row. Also I had a long six hour car trip and played it the whole way. BEST OF ALL NO WI-FI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|As I was reading this book, I felt, like many reviewers, a bit disappointed that Dr. Alexander didn't go into greater length and detail about his time in the hereafter. I then realized, however, that if he had, the book would have just been like so many other NDE books (of which there are some great ones) and it might have fallen short of the unique insight and credibility that he adds to this spiritual phenomenon. The man's a neurosureon and a former skeptic. He has detailed knowledge about the workings of the neocortex and all other parts of the human brain. Just these facts alone make an experience that he describes as \\"indescribable\\", yet more vivid than our earthly reality, a compelling reason to read the book. I think he might be saving more details of his heavenly journey for a follow-up book.<br /><br />I don't understand reviewers who say the book wasn't well-written; I really loved Dr. Alexander's prose and story-telling technique. He goes back and forth between what he experienced and what his family, friends, and associates were experiencing while he was in coma.<br /><br />It's also amusing to me that reviewers get caught up in things like the word 'Proof' in the title. Personally, I'll read a book like this with an implicit understanding that none of us will be able to \\"prove\\" the spiritual while in our current realm. I guess he and the publishers could have chosen 'Evidence of Heaven' as a title, but that probably wouldn't have compelled me to pick it up and read it, so I'm glad they picked 'Proof', because I'm ultimately happy that I've read the book.<br /><br />I find it interesting that one review I saw had the reviewer put off by the seeming 'moral relativism' of Dr. Alexander quoting a spiritual being telling him \\"you can do no wrong\\"... \\"you are loved\\"... etc. These types of messages are what have been quoted by other NDE experiencers as well. Personally, I've interpreted this as meaning he should not be afraid... that he \\"could do no wrong in that heavenly realm\\"; NOT that there were no morals applied to our earthly lives or that we hadn't done wrong while living those lives. Thus, I don't see why this, or any NDE story I've heard, would be at odds with many fundamentalist religious beliefs.<br /><br />I recommend reading this book. Like with other NDE books I've read, it gives more insights into the meaning of the life we're living, rather than being solely about what happens when we die.
B003VANOFY|5.0|If you are looking for the best deal on a top end 7.1 headphone. I have done my R & D and purchased this one for an Alienware 1430BK. It is the perfect compliment.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What amazing story. I couldn't put it down! Definitely not what I expected out of this book. Love love loved it.
B007XF0X6G|3.0|I own it in 2D, but watching in 3D was much better.<br />Not something I will watch a lot but was a good movie.<br />Could have used some more action.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Its an ok game wish it had another option instead of clicking over and over to upgrade building's. Other than that not a bad game.... maybe they will have so.e special purchases for money i dont want to spend too much on a game.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|The story line was great, Fits in with the time-line of Lincoln very well!<br />The special effects were great, especially in 3D.<br />One of my favourites!
B00007GZR5|5.0|An interesting take on life after death.  A totally unexpected set of rules to live by. A serious rold for Williams.
B008NEMN0K|5.0|watched this movie in 2d then bought the 3D. Great movie!<br />Will watch again and again.<br />Great addition to my new video library.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|What a series!  Keeps me on the edge of my seat ontinuously.  Love Jessie's character in his struglle to make good choices in his life, and Walter is just compelling.
B001CDLATE|5.0|You must watch it on the biggest flat screen TV you can find.  It has great soothing music and great scenery.  If you can see it at at a theater, do it.
B00846REIS|2.0|It was a poor copy cat of Shades of Grey<br />It was a poor imitation, I read Shades of Grey, all three novels, and expected something like that.
B00475AYJQ|2.0|The story of Kvothe is great, the narrative fluid and surprising. We eager to know what will happen with all people involved in the first book of the serie.<br /><br />The great problem in this volume is the edition. Where is the editor? He could have cut more than a half of it. Is unnecessarily long and sometimes gets pretty boring. I almost put it aside in some moments.<br /><br />I hope to see more objetive edition on the next book.
1612680011|5.0|I can see that a lots of the reviewers don't consider this book helpful or educational, but in reality I think it is, there are so many mistakes that we do when we get or first job, or our first credit card, etc that we don't even notice!!! when you notice is when you are up to your nose in bills that turn out bigger than the paycheck you thought was huge. I think that this book helps a lot to show you basis of personal administration and then more. I will give this book to my kids when they have their first job. Even when there are many books that pretent to help with personal adminitration most of them are dull for teens (and myself) and sometimes even hard to follow this is the way to start. For me it was a life changer book I recomend it up and down!!!
B008BD9SI8|4.0|The storyline is decently good, but he had better ones in his past books.<br /><br />What worths the reading is to see some of the characters from The Trilogy back! One of the best persona ever created in literature is a central figure in this western-medieval adventure. Who? I won't give spoilers.
0547848412|4.0|Pi is a solid book - doesn't force you to believe his story but gives you an interesting choice as a reader.  It's a believable first person narrative; whereas, so much first person writing has no real literary justification.  Tense moments, but enjoyable throughout.  Overall, while the movie does do the book justice by and large, the book is still better.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|I really got a connection with the main character an his story. The book is great and you got envolved in the narrative.<br /><br />The author is inventive and his stile makes you want to read more and more!
0552999652|5.0|Buy this book if you don't have it. Loved it! The book gets into kore detail then the movie does. This is one of my favorite books/movie. Also read (lone survivor) before the movie cones out.
B004I744AS|4.0|I can expand my word knowledge every day and I am educated by the daily articles included on my mobile app. I use it every day.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I really do love this knife. It is a strong/durible knife that looks great. Plus you can always modify the grips and sheath. There really is nothing wrong with knife, but it is a little on the heavy side. Like I said I love it, but I always end up picking up another one of my knives when I go camping. I don't know why but maybe because of the weight or the crappy sheath.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|If you read the first two books, then Hornets Nest is a must. How does Salanders evolve? Is she \\"norma?\\" Hornet's Nest reveals most!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a great game to pass any free time you may have.  it requires no thinking if you ever just want to disappear
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I watched the first two seasons back to back - to be ready for season 3. The characters are interesting and I love the time period and learning about the interaction of the servants and the family.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed this book...it took a few pages to get into but once you're there you're hooked...heart warming and heart wrenching....
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics, good storyline, like the different kinds of puzzles and the option to play a different puzzle instead of the hidden object.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|When I bought this collection I already had all of Michael Jackson's albums from \\"Off The Wall\\" to \\"Invincible\\". So I really bought this collection for it's unreleased content and I was not dissappointed. I don't think there's a song on this album I don't like except that dumb song \\"Scared of the Moon\\". Even the songs on here that I already have on the albums were still worth having because they are all digitally remastered so it really sounds like you're hearing the same classic MJ songs again for the first time. Plus if you make your own play list and mix his hits and album tracks in with the unreleased stuff it really sound good together. Some of the songs on here that were released I had never heard before like the one with Mick Jagger, \\"State of Shock\\" and \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" which has been sampled by a couple rappers. One of the few Michael Jackson songs to be sampled by another artist. They had to change the name for legal purposes to the dumb title \\"This Place Hotel\\". Whoever the A&R or marketing exec who made up that dumb name to replace the original one should have been fired. To me and all my fellow MJ fans, we will always call it \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" out of honor to MJ and well, just because it sounds better. Other songs I had heard before as a child but only one time so I barely remembered them until I heard them on this collection. Like \\"Shake Your Body (Down To The Ground). But of course the highlight of this collection and the reason most hardcore MJ fans bought it was for the unreleased material. With the exception of \\"Scared of the Moon\\" which could have been dropped altogether, all the previously unreleased tracks are slamming! Classic MJ. Makes me wonder why some of them were never released. Even the Demos rock! The demos really don't sound like demos but actual songs. You have be be somewhat of an audiophile like me and have the right equipment to notice the subtle imperfections between the demos and the polished albums tracks. The audio and mastering flaws don't take away from the songs at all. I barely notice them when I'm in another zone listening to Michael Jackson's music. In fact, they kind of add to them. Gives them that nostalgic old school cassette tape sound but with a little twist of digital remastering. They actually sound like they would have sounded if the were released during the time they were made. Whoever it was that remastered these unreleased demos and shelved songs did an excellent job remastering them considering the original tapes they had to work from. As for the polished unreleased tracks, I love em all. It's hard to pick a favorite but if I did I think I would have to go with \\"Someone Put Your Hand Out\\". That song is musical perfection. It was well put together and you can tell a lot of love went into the creation of that song. The liner notes said it was a Pepsi exclusive cassette release from the Dangerous Tour. It might as well be unreleased because I never heard it until I got this collection. Before now, I never knew it existed. My other fav is \\"The Way You Love Me\\". Again, another beautiful melodic song created with love that really was unreleased until now. Why that song wasn't released as a single we will probably never know. I do know that the liner notes said it was made sometime between 2000 and 2004. Michael Jackson was signed to Sony around that time and released the Invincible album in either 2000 or 2001. If you don't know the story, Michael Jackson was having it out with Sony, especially Tommy Motolla because they weren't promoting the album. That and other personal problems and demons he was battling which I won't get into. If you own the Invincible album, and I'm just assuming you love it like me, listen to \\"The Way You Love Me\\" and you'll see that it would have fit in perfectly on that album. There was only one weak song on the whole album. I think we all know which one it was but I'll say it anyway. 2000 Watts. There were only one or two fast tempo tracks on the album, the rest were melodic ballads like \\"Way You Love Me\\". \\"In The Back\\" was another song that could have been included on the album. Whatever the reasons they were cut at least we can enjoy them now. Hopefully more MJ songs will surface from out of the vaults. It would have been nice if it included the full remastered version of Carousel. A really great song from the Thriller album that was cut by Quincy Jones and replaced by \\"Human Nature\\", which was the stronger of the two songs. Back then they didn't have CD's, mp3's and Ipods so they could only put so many songs on one record and the longer the songs were the less you could put on there. \\"Wanna Be Startin Somethin\\" was a little over six minutes long, \\"Thriller\\" was close to six minutes long, \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Lady In My Life\\" were close to five minutes long and the remaining songs were over four minutes long. The shortest song on the album was \\"The Girl Is Mine\\". That clocked in at three minutes and 42 seconds. Close to four minutes. So they were pressed for space back then. It would have also been nice if \\"Hot Street\\" and \\"Trouble\\" were included in this Ultimate Collection. Two other unreleased tracks recorded around the same time Thriller was. They can still be downloaded off various music sharing sites and heard on Youtube though. I add them in with my MJ playlist too. Still it would have been nice to have them officially released. Carousel was officially released on the Thriller Special Edition version in 2001 but it wasn't the full length version. It was cut really short so they could include more interviews. Maybe they'll be included on future Michael Jackson releases. I think they could make a lot of money just by releasing several albums of nothing but previously unreleased tracks by Michael Jackson. I know the fans would love em. I know I would. It's rumored that Michael Jackson had several hundred unreleased songs in his vault when he died. Imagine all of them coming out as full length albums. Thatwould be something. But it won't happen. Record Companies are too stupid to see that. It would be too much like the right thing to do for his fans. If I was in charge, the vault would be opened and all those unreleased tracks would be remastered and released. Not all at one time though. Over the course of several years. But that's just a dream. We may never hear any of those songs. Though there were seven or eight of them released on that Bad 25 that was released last year. So that gives me a little hope. I don't know about you but I'm so sick of hearing these trashy remixes of his old songs. Some are nice though, like Kanye West's Billie Jean remix. It added an element of the new while still keeping the core sound of the original. Hopefully we'll get more quality Michael Jackson releases like this and not just some record company hiring some no name producers to put out some garbage remix album. Peace!
B003K16P3M|5.0|Excellent reading. Having recently read THE HUNGER GAMES trilogy, I was reluctant to start another book so soon. However GRACELING WAS COMPLETELY fulfilling and I look forward to BITTERBLUE with great enthusiasm. I think this would be wonderful reading for the mid teen. I am recommending it to all my reading friends. This would make an outstanding movie. It does not have the \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" as found inn THE HUNGER GAMES, but the suspense in the travels and the action in the fights and turmoil with Lech, leaves the reader hanging on to see what comes next. I am so ready to read BITTERBLUE.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Definitely a fun game. It's even challenging on just the begginer levels, but stills fun to see just how far you can get. It took a minute to figure out everything(and yes I literally mean a minute...it took a while of shaking and tilting and jiggling around my kindle fire to realize the gas and brake pedals were on the screen :P) I like the little added challenge of not only the time challenge of beating the clock, but also the race aspect of a rival that you're going against. The graphics are smooth, though kind of retro pixel style. Gives it that arcade feel. Overall definitely a worthy purchase.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|In my opinion this app is great, it monitors my battery life and tells me how much time i have left till the battery dies. also it shows me how long it will take to charge to 100% again. All in all anybody that likes to watch their devices battery life, this app is for them.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a great game I really dealt like it a lot it is fun to play I need more coins Lola
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I think this book is STUPID!!!!!(:  I did not enjoy the book at all!!!!(: It was VERY BORING!!!!!!!(: I hated it!!!!(:
B008JGSM6G|5.0|With all the different levels on Flow Free, it is fun for the whole family.  We can each work at our own level.  It really makes you look and work your brain to figure out the correct answer.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me from many hours of sleep. Hard to put down. Bring on the next book!!!!<br />Suzanne, you are phenomenal!!!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie is informative and encouraging; especially if someone you know is autistic. Claire Danes was excellent. A must see!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best book ever. Bought the next book already ;) so hard to but this book down. So worth reading! Read it! Now!
0553062182|5.0|While reading, I discovered why I couldn't go to movies, concerts, or rock music in the park. I am sensitive to noise. I would rather hide than endure loud noises. It's explains why I've made excuses not to go &#34;have fun&#34; with friends all these years. There are other more personal sensitivities to discover for those who have &#34;odd&#34; quirks or behaviors. Very informative. You will feel reassured that you aren't crazy, but rather you have nerve endings that just can't stand some kinds of input.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|so much fun it is just like cut the rope but way more action u should royalty get this game
0736092269|5.0|Great book, wonderful illustrations and concise explanations. Includes minor variations for most exercises in the book and has ts on stretching. Remember, it's called Anatomy not complete workout plan & nutrition guide.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I recommend everyone to read this book. It's beautiful. I cried in the last few chapters, but so far, this is my all-time favorite book.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I liked this app but it wasn't great.. when I tried to buy the full version it said purchase failed or something like purchase denied.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This is a great case made by a stellar brand, and it does work great with the Kindle Fire. However, if you want to use it with the Kindle Fire HD, you're out of luck. Sure they both have a 7 inch screen, but there's about 0.04 inches more added to the Kindle Fire HD's bezel, and though it seems like a minute difference, it renders itself unusable on the Kindle Fire HD. There is no clearly marked distinction between the two versions and it takes a very close look to spot those 0.04 inches, and no where does it explicitly state that it only fits the Fire HD and not the original Fire. Oh what two letters and 0.04 inches can make!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book rocks make a 8th book and make some more movies good job Jeff awesome job
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Amazing storyline, great characters. Seems like there's always more to any situation than meets the eye. If you're looking for something to watch, look no further.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great colors, etc. spent lots of time and will spend more.  i repeat, fun! fast, really easy to navigate the options.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The sound on these things is very good.  IMO it's a better quality sound that most home theater systems.<br /><br />I love that they are wireless, when they are fully charged they have good battery life.  I have to charge them every night before I go to sleep which is fine..I use them pretty much all day.<br /><br />I will never buy another pair of wired headphones after using these...it feels good to not be tethered down by a cord.<br /><br />Great for watching movies and playing games.<br /><br />Only gripe is that they dont work with a ps3 or xbox360 right out of the box, but there are ways to route the sound from your consoles to your PC's line in jack, then you have to use a audio program called audacity to stream the consoles audio to your headphones through your PC.  Only way to make it work with consoles which was the original reason I got these, P.S. it is impossible to get the mic to work with the xbox360.<br /><br />However in Skype the mic i'm told is very clear and I am easily heard, so it's good quality.<br /><br />Also I like the software they bundle with it.<br /><br />There is 1 little annoying bug where sometimes I can't use the volume control on the side of them, but the solution is pretty simple, just turn off the headphones and turn them back on.  Took off a star because of it.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|This old classic is great. I have not read it in many years but it is still a delight. Must read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The ending wasn't what I was expecting, but the storytelling is great, and it moves along well. This book could make you question how well you know the significant other in your life. I think the flip of the hero/villain roles between all of the characters was very well done. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes suspense novels. I look forward to reading more of Mrs. Flynn's writing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing.  The descriptions were so vivid and the plot , being as engaging as it was, made for an excellent combo.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great read!  I didn't want it to end. I can't wait until the next one!  Thanks again to Vince Flynn!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Wonderful story. Couldn't put it down. Loved the way the dog told the story. Had tears running down my face at the end making it hard to finish.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Read this in less than 4 hrs! Could not put it down, the story had me teary eyed one moment and laughing out loud the next. Loved it and look forward to many more from the author.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Another amazing book from Suzanne Collins that makes me want so much more because of the excitement and the romance and the desire that Katniss Everdeen feels as she tries her best to do the right thing and save her loved ones. I cried when I read that she lost her sister and almost everybody she loved.and as she watched her life slip away from her grasp it was terrifying and then I realized not everything has a happy ending. That really surprised me. That is exactly why she is my faverite author
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Judged by the reviews here most audience appreciated this movie both as a tribute to the SEALs and as an entertainment, which is good and important that more people will refer it to their friends and families, more will know about our heroic elites. However, as one of their true admirers who read many books about them, I am obliged to comment that the directors and screenwriters still had not fully told why and how those SEALs are so great, say the hellish training they take and the ideology/philosophy they hold. Anyway, a great movie for all adult civilians despite the bloody yet real combat scenes! Highly recommended!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|While the performances are appealing, the real surprise is the quality of the songwriting: no filler, no duds, just one fine composition after another.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Rating it a 2 star is being nice.  Absolutely the worst book I have ever read.  This girl is suppose to be naive but the stuff she does is not.  Dumbest book ever.  I could not even finish it.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun and addictive. Sometimes not clear what is happening when I win. Would be good to know what the specific rules are
B009FZHYKU|5.0|After watching the first two seasons, it was an automatic buy for season 3. Quality has been great, streaming through Xbox over Fios. Definitely recommend!
B004QX07G4|5.0|This book was fabulous! I was seriously laughing through the whole thing. I love that Ellen is so caring too. We need more people like her in this world!
B00012QM8G|5.0|My husband likes the movie, We will buy more of the older movies as we find them or remember them.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|It is a must see for the holiday season -- for older teens and adults. The lanuage is not &#34;kid friendly&#34;... the move we see every year on television is edited to be the more family friendly movie we all know and love.
B007KFZ7RE|5.0|I was exposed to Nick just today from a friend of mine who has a weekly radio show.  Awesome talent and I'm gonna buy this as soon as I get home.<br /><br />It seems that analog \\"REAL\\" music might be making a comeback.  \\"Can't stop\\" rhythm, \\"in your gut\\" baritone sax, and \\"soul-churning\\" vocals.  This has it all and I hope another album is not going to be a long wait.  I would love to see a show with Nick Waterhouse and James Hunter, another favorite blue-eyed soul genius.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|I have loved Jodi Picoult books but found this one is just a little drawn out with way too much religious overtones in it but enjoyable light read nevertheless.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|Harry Bosch is one of my favourite characters of Michael Connelly, so I always enjoy the intrigue he gets into.<br />Fast moving, well written.  Other people who enjoy Michael Connellys writing should enjoy this book.
B00ANT9MZW|5.0|i may have found this confusing since i am not up on military jargon and the like except that i'd already read one of the books on this operation which involves the CIA finding bin laden and the Navy Seals storming his compound and killing him. there were a lot of years of backbreaking work which went into uncovering him whereas the operation itself is very fast. i can't imagine what else could have possibly been included in this to give us the entire story as we started out with 911 and kept going unil bin laden's death.<br /><br />jessica chastain is on the job from first frame until last.  i don't know if she is based on a real woman or not but she is an excellent actress so she was an excellent choice for the lead.  she is the CIA agent who finds the house all those years later after following the leads. i thought she was a believable cia agent too.  she was not flashy at all but she was utterly dogged and determined.<br /><br />i applaud director bigelow's choice to shoot it entirely in english,  i think i would have gotten lost following all of the different languages and dialects going on in that end of the world.  she's done another fantastic film and i am sure will be up for the Oscar again.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I love playing, and I already had one game when this one came up. This one is so much better that I only play this one now. If you try it you will love it too!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves<br />Best book I've read in the last 10 years , I  found it very scarey. These two authors write to my taste. Two Graves
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I would recommend this book to my friends. I loved the whole book!!!  I love how it gives you mixed emotions. It is such a good story!
B001706I5I|2.0|Yes the story ends on a good note, but i found the grinch figure to be too scary erratic and psycho for my 6.5 year old. It wasnt fun... i kept watching with her waiting for the story to turn, but it came very late.<br /><br />Besides the scary grinch figure, the story is boring - the plot is thin. Nothing really happens there. Just another Christmas movie.
B007V65R54|5.0|Excellent book if you want to understand the power (and many pitfalls) of prediction.<br /><br />I've read a couple of books on this topic, including Future Babble (also good), but this one stood out for two reasons. For one, you can clearly see that Silver is a practitioner himself, giving the book an extra level of credibility (and providing a lot of interesting details on the various topics he writes about).<br /><br />Second, he is not ideological in his approach, but argues for a nuanced and more pragmatic approach to prediction. For instance, while he is clearly a big data hound, he also argues against the so-called 'technical analysis' (where you only look for patterns in the data without trying to understand the underlying causality of what you are trying to predict). The book gives you a good idea of why he has managed to have a solid track record on his own predictions. In short, good stuff.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book, like all of Nicholas Sparks' other books, was incredible and heart-wrenching. It had me entertained right from the beginning. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next!
B0053O89YM|4.0|I own all 3 seasons of THE GOOD WIFE on DVD.  I'm a big fan of courtroom drama, be it in books or movies; and there is some Long-Range, exceptionally fine courtroom strategy in season 3.  State-of-the-art long-range courtroom strategy.  Why the 4-star review?  Because I am pissed that starting in season 2 THE GOOD WIFE added a digital blur to the DVD discs on top of the optical blur that the series is shot in to obscure the age of the stars.  I am irritated that the studio deliberately ships inferior video for the DVD format on seasons two and three.  If season one is sharp, why can't they do that next year, and the year after for season two and three???  When the picture quality of season one of a show on DVD is better than season two and three on DVD, you know something is wrong.  @hg47
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Let me start out by saying I never take the time to actually write reviews.<br /><br />That being said this book was fantastic. I was hooked for the first paragraph. I ended up staying up all night just to finish this book! My husband thought I was crazy!<br /><br />A spectacular read from start to finish. You feel so connected to the characters you wish they were all real!<br /><br />Would most defiantly recommend to anyone!
B004WMKSH2|4.0|This movie, like its predecessor Half-Blood, left much of the joy of the novel aside to focus on the Tim Burton-esque landscape and dark and forboding cinema. After Order of the Phoenix, the sets became so grim that they no longer really represented Rowling's work. Even the table settings lacked food and festivities always provided by the kitchens of Hogwarts!<br /><br />The last four Harry Potter's represent the director's vision with Hallows Pt. 1, the least satisfying. My dream is that a remake of the series, dedicated to more accurate representation of the novels, will begin before too long.<br /><br />The stunted emotional range of the leads (and Radcliffe's self-reported inebriation during filming) took its toll as well in Hallows Pt. 1. Those who did not read the books will likely love it much more than those who longed to see more of Rowling and less of Hollywood.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is way better than the game I had to play in 5th and 6th grade on the old Apple computer
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I imagine that critics really hated this one. But being a type who enjoys movies for entertainment rather than artsy and clumsy messages, I liked this one and enjoyed watching it with my young teen-age daughter. I would wish for better, but it's worth a viewing from normal folks looking for something to pass the time.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a phenomenal story that makes you cry at the start and laugh at the end. A must read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I closed the book-- I knew I HAD to read the trilogy.  Characters are strong and compelling and very credible.  She stays true to the essence of the characters though out.  Steamy.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I was kind of worried that the writers would not be able to pull this one off, but MIB III is great. I'm glad Amazon had this one available. The movie is quite entertaining with Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith doing their usual insane best as agents \\"K\\" & \\"J\\".
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read the trilogy twice and enjoyed the books each time.<br />All the books were entertaning, compelling and fun reads.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The book was excellent. I have read everything from both Preston and Child. Starting with the Relic and beyond. We really<br />enjoy the Pendergast characters. I can't wait for a new one already...Non-stop reading enjoyment at its best!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the series.  I read them twice.  She made me go back and re-read.  I thouroughly enjoyed thecharacters and the attachments created.  Left me wanting more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't want to put it down... I read until 4am when I had to force myself to put it down because I had to wake up for work at 6:00am! It was so touching and I was so captivated by the story line and the characters! I def reccommend this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Started good. Credible characters, but then author threw them off a cliff.<br />She wanted too much at the end and the characters did not recover from the twisting and turning.
B0015AARJI|5.0|This ps3 controller works precisely as it should after 2 weeks of use. It is the standard controller and I don't think much else needs to be said.
0345803485|2.0|The back of the book is labeled Erotic Romance. I have issues about this book fitting the romance genre. It doesn't.<br /><br />In the romance genre there are two stories the outer story, with all the action and so forth and the romance -the relationship - conflict - attraction - and sexual tension between the hero and heroine. The outer story in this book isn't much at all, it doesn't seem like there is one. She's taking her final exams, she works at a hardware store, and she has a roommate -not much of a story. Then because of the inner story every book I've ever read or heard of in the romance genre is written in third person so we can see the viewpoint of both the hero and heroine. This story would have been better written in third person so we could have known Christina's point of view, his direct thoughts and feelings toward Ana as the relationship develops.<br /><br />One of the issues with the writing is there is too much telling rather than showing it should be the other way around.<br /><br />A hard requirement of the romance genre is either a happy ever after ending or a happy for now ending. But this book does not have a happy ending. Maybe the trilogy does, I don't know.<br /><br />In every romance I've ever read, the heroine is a strong woman. This character is emotionally immature, and sexually immature far beyond being a virgin. Even though she's beautiful, lives in the college dorms, is 21 and a modern American woman, she's never been kissed before and never even masturbated. It's odd. She gets drunk from a few margaritas which is odd also. At the beginning of the book she keeps falling down. I think Christian is attracted to her because she seems so easy to control. Like most women, I don't' like weak female characters. Because it's in first person we don't get to explore Christian in any depth.<br /><br />This book really doesn't fit the romance genre in my opinion. I couldn't get into these characters. I really didn't like them.
B000MLNUBI|5.0|- This watch has an automatic movement which means that it will that the accuracy will be hindered by a few seconds each day, or a minute or two by the end of 2 or 3 weeks. All automatics perform differently however mine has kept fairly good time so far. Also just keep in mind that these watches are more fragile in nature. Dropping it from a table to hard floor, hitting it against a wall too hard, playing golf with can damage its ability to keep accurate time.<br /><br />- I was concerned that the watch would be hard to read because of how \\"distracting\\" the parts of the watch would be, but the white arms and circle (on the second hand) allow your eyes to easily find them.<br /><br />-The watch isn't huge (the dial) but the band comes quite large, so you will need to adjust it. I took it to a Swatch Store and they did it for free, but I also ordered a $2-3 tool on Amazon for it and it works fine too.<br /><br />-Straps are easily replaceable, you can remove the current ones with a paper clip and replace it easily. (search on Amazon: 17 mm swatch straps).<br /><br />-One of my favorite features is that the watch can be hand winded with the crown, which means if you are not going to be wearing the watch for a few days, you can keep it running without purchasing a $50 watch winder.<br /><br />-Glow in the dark works fairly well under direct light and for a short period of time. Not nearly advanced as the glow-in-the-dark of a Seiko or Citizen. The face may also scratch easily, if you are not careful with it. It is not a hard mineral. Swatch will buff it out for you though and make it look very good.<br /><br />Additional thoughts: This watch is really shiny, not a brushed metal that is common with other bracelet watches. Not a con but it will scratch easily.<br /><br />For the future - Also, Swatches aren't really designed to be opened. Generally people get their automatic watches serviced every couple of years (at least the high end watches) and since the servicing would cost maybe twice the price of this watch, it is not something that I would do. But... the watch at some point will stop working (15 years? more?) and if you ever want to take it to a watch store to open it up and get it running again, you really can't. However, someone pointed out that they can try to open it from the top. Just something to keep in mind if you want to try to get this working again whenever it dies. Hopefully they keep selling these, I love it.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I usually enjoy object search games like this. That being said, market-driven apps like these take the fun out of them. Because energy and diamonds are used up so quickly in normal gameplay, the 'optional' purchase of in-game currency becomes more and more mandatory over time. I like to keep my PtP (pay to play) game subscriptions to a bare minimum, so I don't recommend this game to anyone who hasn't won the  lottery.
B0096DZKZC|4.0|ive been waiting for about 2 hours and still haven't gotten it yet... but my brother got it and his started loading af5er mine... its a RIPOFF! but it looks cool!&trade; I cant belive how long the wait is. GhhG HGg HFf HGDjHF
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This really was a great way to spend time while on a flight.  Easy to refresh and attempt to move to next level.  Will look for more games from Rovio Entertainment.
B008MAI0WK|5.0|I'm starting reading this book (40%) and i find it very usefull for every person who really want to learn the raspberry pi computer from the ground. I highly recommend it and I hope you have fun as well.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Enjoy playing in spare time and easy to learn. It is good to have a game with levels like this.
0307719774|4.0|This book  gives me a reason to write down my thoughts.  I have a journal but long periods of time go by between entriesl  I like the variety of questions to think about and expand my life story.  It will be interesting as the five years go by to see how I thought in years past.
B001NVIZ3E|4.0|My 12 year old and I really  enjoyed this movie together. Just like I used to with my Grandmother.<br />I was looking for something action packed with a great story, but no gore. Perfect.
1451695195|3.0|Havent finished book yet.  From what I read so far its been okay.  Will try to finish this week end.  Vry interesting and gives room for thought.
B0092C2X7U|1.0|It was challenging to learn. I bet once a person learns the technique to the game it's fun. s s
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I couldnt find my original cord.  I called got excellent customer service by a customer rep who was extremely professional and very plesant to speak with and to.  Happy with the product.
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|Great movie and Great for all ages. Worth watching. It will have one and all laughing each time you watch.
1410420302|5.0|I have enjoyed Mitch's offerings for many years.  He  selects a message and, with few words, conveys that message to the reader in a quick read, not needing an extended volume of non-essential WORDS.
0385340540|1.0|I recalled 'The Firm' being a nice, interesting thriller that benefitted from a different style of writing at the time.  It was no 'Presumed Innocent' in terms of writing style, but it was fun read. After I started reading 'Broker' I had to go back and look at 'Firm' to see if I was just young and foolish when I read that first book. No, while 'Firm' had some problems, 'Broker' is simply a poor effort. It is as if Grisham took a vacation in Italy and wanted to write about places he liked. Endless descriptions of landmarks add nothing to the story. Even more Italian lessons that you end up skipping; imagine, skipping parts of a book. Talk about not adding to the story line.  Grammatical errors. Pages spent building up characters and plot threads, and then in the last 50 pages a complete change in writing style that leaves out, during the book's climax, potentially the most fertile possibilities as well as plot threads untied.  It is as if, after spending chapters on descriptions of 'ancient' Italian structures (yes he uses 'ancient' to describe the buildings, etc. too often, even twice in the same paragraph) and Italian lessons, Grisham had to end the book quickly or make it 700 pages long. In so doing, he left so much untied and one major inconsistency that any editor who read the book would have caught.  I finished the book and my first comment was how the book would have never been published if Grisham has submitted it under a pseudonym. I have read better books that have not been published. I guess Mr. Grisham had to write off his trip to Italy and what better way than a quick story thrown together without any research other than his visit to Italy (he says as much in his epilogue).  I would suggest you go back and read 'The Firm' but there are too many good books out there to read. Hope this helps you avoid wasting time on a subpar work.
B008QTUA5W|3.0|I really liked the story line of this series and found it gripping and engaging. However, I'm not a fan of graphic sex scenes and nudity. I should have expected as much from Showtime, but honestly I found it detracted from the story for my husband and I and as a result, I can only give it 3 stars. If they had reduced the sex and nudity and F-bombs, I could give it 4 stars (though I found the acting by Damian Lewis to be lacking- fairly Kevin Costner-like in my opinion, and that is NOT a compliment). Claire Danes did an outstanding job, and plays a very convincing role here. Bottom line, if you liked 24 and are not opposed to nudity, sex, and profanity you will likely love it. However, if you prefer a less graphic program this might not be for you. It's definitely not a program to watch in the family room with the volume cranked where the kids can hear the panting, moaning, swearing and the like- you'll want to fire up the laptop and watch in a kid-friendly room! Looking forward to season 2 on the laptop with the fast-forward handy.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|This is a decent little all-in-one case and cover for the Kindle Fire. The cover folds back rather easily to form a stand. The only minor drawbacks are the white case gets dirty rather easily (to be expected. It is white), and the felt lining of the cover is a pet hair magnet. Overall, I'm really happy with this case.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|i loved this game. i have always loved hidden object games. i also want to be a detective so i thought this was an awesome game. I would recommend it to everyone and anyone who asked.
1449410243|5.0|Five star rating for a great, very funny book. From a very hardcore animal, particularly cats, lover! Plus got one for another cat lover!
B0076DELIG|3.0|My headline says it all...a good read, but I really do hate flashbacks, so boring. And the Danish woman's part in the plot was odd enough to distract. As in, why Danish?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The characters in this novel were so well developed that you felt like you personally knew them.  Knowing the outcome, however, could not be imagined!  An excellent story of parent/teenager relationship and the deep love of the teen aged couple.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Great reading. Kept my attention throughout the whole book. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes mysteries and thrillers.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|Bruno Mars has brought joy to my ears once again! Doo-Wops & Hooligans was great but Unorthodox Jukebox is so much better. The collections of songs he has for this album shows off his range and talent. I love love love this album. A must hear!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This series has had me caught up for a week. I can't wait for another book...I have enjoyed this series!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I liked this because it is challenging and there is a timer.  At first the timer bothered me and I didn't like it because I wanted something really relaxing.  But, as I went on and on I really was hooked.  I've completed all levels as far as I can go with the free edition.  I'll have to think about if I want to go on and purchase the next level or new changes.  It is also fun as you go to design your own fish tank and place items wherever you want.  I love that part as well.  Overall I really would recommend this particular game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use. Does what is supposed to. It does have ad pages after every shuffle but it is easy to get part them.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I actually had an opportunity to hear Shawn speak and couldn't wait to read the book.  Excellent principles to live your life by.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is great family fun. It can make all ages laugh. If you want to have a good family night together laughing pick this movie.
B000ID37KO|5.0|Great streaming and quality of film.  We couldn't believe the color. One of Hitchcock's best films.. Thank you for bringing back the oldies in such great quality.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|One of the best movies about baseball I have ever enjoyed and that is saying a lot.  Good job by all concerned.
B000002GVZ|5.0|I loved the album in the 70's and I was not disappointed with this CD.  Love it and will purchase more of Carly Simon.
B002RI8ZPK|5.0|I confess that I am now a true Raymond Chandler groupie!  I love the writing, love the plots. 90% of the quotes in my kindle are from Philip Marlowe.  Loved them all - I'll read them again and again.  A must for crime junkies.
B00ARI9CDQ|2.0|Nice app, especially how they've arranged the stories in separate columns for easier perusal. When it works, it is enjoyable to peruse but without fail, when I scroll more than halfway down the middle column, the app immediately closes out. Once this is fixed, should be a good app. Til then, I'll use online version.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Actually I am probably a bit more than middle aged, but I won't quibble over a few years.  I liked the movie, which I went to see with my family - anything with archery has to be  OK right?  So I decided to read the whole series and during a  bout of the flu read them all in 3 days.  Loved them, couldn't stop pressing that 'next page' button to see what would happen.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I bought this as a Christmas Gift to my father and after he opened we started watching them right away. Love the extra features and the movies themselves have always been classic. If you don't own them individually i would highly recommend getting them as the set.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|It's not Google, it's a sub of Google. I want the real thing. Google is all about asking random questions and actually getting true answers. If I wanted the 3rd degree about my question I would have gone through Ask.com
B007FH9GA6|3.0|The books are better & even those are just ok. Love the insights into Swedish culture so that's a plus...
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I love this story. It's. so much better than the movie. I was deliciously. lost in the magic and details. The characters are so well written.  It's as if you are right there in France and I swear I could smell the chocolate!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game app for all ages. I couldn't put it down and both my 3 & 6 year olds love it.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Good movie, but to much guns in the movie. Also a lot of violence, story was not good.I liked the first two movies best.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I don't know how we missed this one when it was first released. We caught about the last 25 minutes on TV and then had to have it. A good one for any collection.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my niece who has recently discovered vinyl.  She loves this album, and is very excited to collect more Beatles!!!
B0002IQMKM|5.0|I bought this CD to replace an old tape. Brought back some fond road trip memories, great CD, a must for every ones music collection.
B0000TB014|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my Mom.  It's so cute to watch her dancing around to Michael!!!  She loves it
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this twice. im a sucker for love stories, but this was truly great. There was excitement, love,suspence, laughs, heart melters, and what every girl wants. I read it in one sitting and I HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone, especially someone who loves a well written love story that will take you on a journey.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my Mom.  It's so cute to watch her dancing around to Michael!!!  She loves it
B0087EVHVW|5.0|Seriously blazing fast, never ever locks up runs games like a champ. A++<br /><br />Seriously, buy it. If you wanna overclock then go for a 2500k though.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Such a great read. This book is written as a documentary after-the-fact: the world zombie war is over and he is talking to survivors. Such detail-- like he wrote all of these survivors' stories first and then wrote their journals and then took excerpts from those. Amazing, interesting, innovative and incredibly detailed. I don't know how the movie will be, but I'll hope for the best!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Start with an old bottle first and practice. But after you get past the first one to practice.. it works great.
B004QX07G4|5.0|UPBEAT COMICAL fun relaxing adventure that Ellen takes the reader on. A fun book that will make you smile in true Ellen fashion!
1933952806|5.0|This book covers everything you need to know about the D7000 in full detail and easy to follow instructions. Its very hands on!
B001HQZJPM|4.0|I bought this trilogy to replace VHS tapes of the first 2 movies.  Loved the first 2 movies, but the 3rd one was lame.  Otherwise, I would have given the set a 5 star rating.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so good and I loved the twist that it had. I was on the edge of my seat as I read the pages. I will be looking for more books this author.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|More emotions wave out of this book. You can't but help the way you feel.<br />Looking forward to the final edition.
0375424474|5.0|This is the evolutionary anatomy book I've been looking for for years. A thorough, simple, clear and logical explanation of the history of the human body with names, dates, DNA and diagrams. How that history is clearly evidenced today in the astonishing similarities shared by all boned creatures (seen in skeletal structure and embryonic developement) and leading back to the farthest reaches of the fossil record.<br />Neil Shubin's qualification, knowledge and experience in this subject pervades his book with eminent authority. I trusted him from the start. His passion and excitement for the subject are infectious. His entertaining style makes this delicious meal of science bite sized and easily digested. And remembered.
B009SQQRH2|4.0|It's endearing,  the Christmas details in the writing and animation are \\"awww\\"-worthy,  and the whole family can actually enjoy it as a suspenseful adventure that avoids most clich&eacute;s,  instead of adult jokes just for them that the kids won't understand.  I wish it got more promotion than the\\" guardians of\\" whatever movie that had elves looking like gremlins. Excellent movie.
B0085YNML2|1.0|This is  a cute and fun game. That is challenging and visually beautiful. But it has been draining my battery even when I haven't opened the app. It has drained up to 20% of my battery in a single day without it being opened. Even though it is fun and I enjoy it I must uninstall because of that problem.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters and loved it.  It's not just a kids' movie.  It's a movie that I enjoy watching.  The Blu-ray quality is impeccable and it really gives Pixar's amazing animation the showcase it deserves.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|Although the story telling is exceptionally good, the problem with 'cast away' stories is they get boring after a certain point.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|this book is intriguing and definitely keeps you on your toes. i would recommend it to anyone who appreciates a hard fought love story with a very diverse plot line.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Hats off to Sparks for this one! I couldn't stop reading! He has a way of helping you identify with each character,even the abuser! Very well written kept me clinging to my kindle for dear life at times!! Great book!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I give it five stars on account of my husband. He loves this movie and was thrilled to get this Collector's Edition for Christmas. He loves the sci-fi story line, the special effects and the twist.
0345803493|1.0|Worst purchase ever.  Got this as a present for my wife and she became addicted to the story line worse then a heroin user.  She couldn't put the damn thing down and read it twice.  I'm scared of what she expects from me now!!!!  Careful guys!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I LOVE this game!!!! It's so addicting it's hard to stop playing. It's pretty simple to use. I do wish the same app that's on the Ipad To be jewled blitz was available for the kindle fire.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I enjoyed this movie very much but I watched the trailer for the movie before renting it from amazon prime and much to my disappointment there wasn't a whole lot of epically entertaining scenes aside from what was highlighted in the trailers.

1451695195|4.0|Eben Alexander did a lot of soul searching after recovering from a brain infection. He had to reconcile his medical training with his own experience. He tells his story using some technical references, which I found informative,but probably doesn't sway skeptics.
B005LAII8A|1.0|Minor spoiler alert.<br /><br />So this is what we have come to? killing children in movies? Directors and screen writers are so lazy that instead of attempting to write an original story that will bring true intrigue, they continually push the envelope of movie making to darker places, as in this movie where A CHILD IS SHOT or at least implied to be killed. Pathetic writing, lazy writing. A colossal waste of time and money. There is nothing satisfying about this movie,and actors, writers,etc who perpetuate this crap in the theaters are just as culpable of crimes committed in real life.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Interesting story line. Engaging from the beginning to the end. Not traditional court room drama as usually read from John Grisham's.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Better than I thought. Good story line and funny. Quality of delivery of movie was great. Love renting from amazon because the nearest rental redbox is 12 miles from house. We live in rural area. So this is waay more convienant.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a 10 year old girl and I love this game. its so awesome bcuz I made a tower so high it wont go any higher! its also awesome bcuz there r many blocks and things to choose from!!! p.s. I love Harry potter!
B00006LLNU|5.0|A musical journey that takes you through many diverse sounds and emotions. Great for popping in CD player  for a long ride.
1939416019|5.0|Morgan Rice's book is one of the best medieval fantasies I've read. The majestic aura of the Ring and the characters alone make you wish that you were in those times. The suspense of the Canyon and all the bad omens keep you on your feet. This will be a great series that I hope doesn't end. If you love mystical creatures, kingdoms, and knights in shining armor, than I suggest you buy this book. You won't be disappointed!

B0084B5TK8|5.0|I liked this book because it was well written and included one of my favorite things-monsters. Dracula has always been one of my favorite monster stories, so I hope you enjoy it too. Bram Stoker knew what he was writing and I really enjoyed this book.
B0050R0YB8|4.0|I got this for my 8 year old son for Christmas.  I had to assemble it - pretty involved process.  He absolutely loves it, and I enjoyed building it.  I didn't give it 5 stars because it is really only for display.  There is no way it is a toy and he can't really play with it.  Still he loves it and understands he can't pick it up.  For the most part, it's very impressive.

B00004XMTJ|5.0|This original Andrew Lloyd Webber production specifically filmed in 1998 for DVD/video is beautiful. Elaine Paige, an original London cast member, sings 'Memory'. The digital sound of a seventy piece orchestra, the dancing, costumes, and stage are done so well, I feel like I am in the front row. I bought this because I was never able to see Cats on stage. This is a beautiful keepsake that I can watch over and over. And I enjoyed the added behind the scenes production information about the making of Cats.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book in one word: disappointing.<br />Watching the \\"girl on fire\\" turn into a sappy, depressing, almost selfishly suicidal makes me hate this book.<br />When it does heat up to action (expect to be in triple digit page numbers-- this book drags that much), Katniss passes out, gets drugged and/or faints...leaving a sub par version to be told to the reader.<br /><br />Having loved the first book and merely liked the second one...the series continues the downward spiral with this ending. Needless to say, I would not recommend this book to family and friends. Getting through it felt more like a chore.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|A fast read and very compelling. The twists and turns dealing with Kay's feelings concerning Peeta  and Gale. Her wish to care for her family's wellbeing and fear of the government's reaction to her and Peeta's victory leading into the next book. Like I said I'm hungry for more.

B004XDYJRU|3.0|Purchased the Pro version after using the free version for months. However, the Pro version demands that I be signed into the Amazon app store and shuts down if I refuse! The weird thing is: the streaming music keeps playing even after I refuse to sign into Amazon...I just can't change any stations (because the app is technically 'shut-down' after my refusal). Weird stuff, eh? The free version never made me sign into Amazon and, frankly, I'm perplexed as to why the Pro version requires this. It obviously has nothing to do with streaming music!<br />Great app, but basically useless to me now. Because the Amazon app store is a memory hog, I've had to delete it in order to use my phone....now I can't use Tune-in Pro, either. Dumb.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I Don't think that there is a genuinely bad book by Rick Riordan.  It's not his best book but way better than the majority of stuff being written for this age group.  A great book that I would highly recommend to any boy from 10-16 years old.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Created a believable post-apocalyptic world with the background information teased out in stages rather than crowbarred in with infodumps. That takes skill, and Mr. Howey delivered. I enjoyed the world's complexity, and the authenticity of the characters' reactions to the hidden truths and desperate situations. A very enjoyable read.

098555780X|2.0|Paracord Fusion Ties Volume One has no apparent reason for being.  Oh, don't get me wrong, the pages are readable, the photographs excellent for having been made by the author while he ties knots, but beyond the asthetic value of this book, it has none.<br /><br />  *  Photographs are sharp and attractive.  They could have been more useful if completed projects were shown front and back instead of just a single view.<br />  *  The book presents the knotting in a sequential manner starting with simple and building to complex.<br />  *  There are more than two dozen projects ranging from basic to complex mixtures of knots.<br />  *  Photographs jump back and forth showing some knots inverted compared to the previous photo in the set which is more confusing than helpful.<br />  *  Text is the only hint to what is going to happen or what has just happened to the knots.  Good line drawings would be better.  Combining the same text with good line drawings would make this book instructional. Show, don't tell.<br />  *  The author makes up his own names for a number of common knots.  Just one example is the traditional &#34;lanyard knot&#34; which is renamed in this book the &#34;diamond&#34; knot.  Not helpful<br />  *  Each knot or project is preceded with a list of component parts.  However, describing all the components as &#34;Historical Knot&#34; without further explanation is less than useful.  If this component of each project is included, it should include all parts and, in the case of &#34;Historical Knot&#34;, what the knot is and what makes it historical.<br /><br />As a former sailor I have quite a bit of experience tying knots, and perhaps that is why I don't care for this book.  However, I've listed what I think are some of the major drawbacks of Paracord FustionTies Volume One.  Maybe this book was written for people who have never tied anything more taxing than shoe laces, but even so, it is a far cry from a real instruction manual.  There are much better books available on the topics of knot tieing and paracord tieing than this one.  If you want to learn how to do it, find one of them.ooks available on the topics of knot tieing and paracord tieing than this one.  If you want to learn how to do it, find one of them.
B00AB0AXU6|1.0|Ever felt that a movie actually wasted your life? This was one for me. This installment of RE is truly terrible. The acting is atrocious, the storyline weak, the effects mediocre, a half assed attempt all around. The single star awarded here is for Milla, who really needs to seek retribution, as do I.
140053271X|2.0|Spent an entire day trying to set up the device to download books from my library.  Library was very helpful but B&N tech support is outsourced and very, very difficult to work with and hard to understand.  I finally, after 4 calls, asked to speak to a supervisor who worked for over an hour to clean up the nook issues.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot! I love Batman and super hero movies but the Batman movies are the best. Especially this one. It tells a great story. There is a lot of action and Bane is AWESOME!!!!  If you like Batman and the previous movies you will love this. Cat woman is even a good character in this.. Truthfully the Batman isn't even in the movie a ton. Bruce Wayne is and it works for me at least. 5 stars because it's a great flick!

159420411X|4.0|I came into Nate Silver's debut book The Signal and the Noise expecting the world.  Those paying attention to the news (particularly election coverage) will probably find his name familiar: he is the man who, in 2008, was able to successfully predict the electoral college results for 49 out of 50 states.  More recently, in 2012, he was able to predict every state's electoral college results.  Silver was able to see the future, able to predict what so many people on TV said was unclear.  Was he a witch?  A magician of some sort?  A time traveler reporting back to us from years in the future?  The fact that this book has been listed as one of 2012's best raised my expectations even further.  The Signal and the Noise is less concerned with explaining Silver's methods for forecasting political results than it is providing a primer to basic prediction and modeling.<br /><br />The Signal and the Noise is broken into four mostly distinct sections:<br />The first quarter of the book discusses how prediction is used (for better or worse) in a variety of fields, such as politics, baseball, and finance.<br />The second quarter focuses on chaotic and complex systems where prediction is considerably more difficult (weather, diseases, earthquakes).<br />The third quarter begins to explain a few solutions to the problems introduced in the first half of the book.  Silver introduces Bayes theorem*, which he frames all subsequent content through.<br />The final chapters of the book aims to tackle \\"big issue\\" topics through Bayes' theorem: can we predict the stock market?  Climate change?  Terrorism?<br /><br />Silver's book aims to cover a significant amount of ground here, and unfortunately, that's its biggest problem.  Because the book covers material from baseball, terrorism, and weather, a nontrivial amount of the book is spent explaining background information for these areas.  Before being able to properly discuss how statistics can be used in poker, Silver has to explain the fundamentals and particulars of the game.  Because every chapter handles a different domain, there's a lot of explanation, caveats, and preparation before actually delving into what this book was intended for: focusing in on how we can use statistics to predict outcomes.  The Signal and the Noise is Silver's first book, and it has a hefty goal -- even some of the world's best nonfiction writers would have a hard time encapsulating this information in an easy, concise way, so the writing is somewhat excusable here.  Silver's writing isn't bad per se, it's just a bit dry and monotonous.  Writing about science doesn't have to be dry: Carl Sagan, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Hawking, and Malcolm Gladwell all write (or wrote) about science in a way that can be dramatic and gripping.  Silver might get there one day -- he's good at boiling down complex information into more digestible ways, but he's not quite there yet.<br /><br />One significant problem (for me at least) is the endnotes -- The Signal and the Noise  contains enough endnotes to rival David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest.  Unfortunately, there are also footnotes, so when an endnote is listed in the text, it's difficult to know if it is referring to a brief aside (similar to what footnotes are usually used for) or just a reference.  Because the book is so well researched, there are a ton of these endnotes to cite the original source material, but it also quickly becomes a chore flipping to the back of the book.  Most chapters have over 50 endnotes, with some chapters going well over 100.  I wish that Silver moved the non-reference notes to the footnotes (at the bottom of the page) so that they did not get lost in the endless references.  The book is long -- over 450 pages -- and constantly flipping to the back of the book to find out if the endnote indicates a reference or an informative aside can be quite exhausting.<br />So who is this book for?  It seems to be aimed at the average person, and most of the writing and tone is appropriate for such.  However, because most of the material focuses on background for other sciences' areas, I would probably only recommend this book to people really interested in prediction.  Readers that are unfamiliar with statistics will probably find quite a bit of material here worth learning about.  The Signal and the Noise was more theoretical than applicable -- I would recommend it to the intellectually curious, and those looking for some ideas to mull over in their head.  Readers should come away from this book hungry for more information on prediction.  My background is in experimental (laboratory based) research, so many of the themes that come up in The Signal and the Noise were completely new.  What was new though, was the way that Silver thought about conditional probabilities in \\"real-world\\" setting.<br /><br />This book doesn't even try to make its readers professionals (or even good) at statistics, but it aims to instill a since of appreciation for uncertainty in the world.  Early on, Silver explains a predictability paradox -- we can make our best predictions if we acknowledge and embrace the most uncertainty.  Everything in the book is put through this light, and it makes for a good (and helpful) theme.  After reading this book, will you be able to predict and model election results to the same accuracy of Nate Silver?  Probably not.  Can you use some of these principles towards your own life?  Absolutely.<br />I couldn't help but be let down a little by this book overall.  It tries to be all things at once, but in the end, it never quite coheres into a whole.  There are plenty of ideas, but only a few themes are able to bind them all together.  The book also contains a short diatribe of frequentist statistics that will likely anger traditional statisticians -- while Silver's objections on the subject are not new (as he admits), he does seem to throw the baby out with the bath water.  There are plenty of graphs and figures in the book, but they rarely hold any caption; most are easy enough to understand, but a few figures left me scratching my head as to what I was looking at.  Additionally, readers looking for specifics on how Silver's FiveThirtyEight blog forecasts election results will be disappointed.  I'm happy that so many readers seemed to have loved this book, but it just doesn't work completely for me.<br /><br />Early on, Silver talks about two different types of thinkers: foxes and hedgehogs.  Hedgehogs are people who filter the world through one giant idea (or theory), and foxes are people who use multiple ideas to conceive the world.  Silver returns to this motif a few times, pointing how nice it is to be a fox and the disadvantages of being a hedgehog.  By the end of the book though, I can't help but feel as it Silver is actually one of the \\"hedgehogs\\" that he disdains, filtering the world through one key theory, that everything can be, and should be, seen through Bayesian inference.<br />*Bayesian inference is a branch of statistics that uses probabilities and conditional probabilities to ascertain how certain, or probable, any given event is.g and tone is appropriate for such.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I recently read this book as a book club assignment.  I will say I thought it was a little odd at first since the entire book is written as a series of letters between the characters (some major as well as minor characters).  Once I got over that, I became very wrapped-up in the story.  It is very well-written and draws the reader into the story.  It's descriptive without being overly so.  I chuckled a lot, laughed out loud and even shed a few tears.  It's an easy read.  I think it would be appropriate reading for younger teens through adult.  I loved it!

B00913P6G0|5.0|In the modern hip-hop industry, pretty much any rapper who wants to make it has to start at the bottom with a few mixtapes and move up to independently released pseudo albums. Kendrick Lamar has done both. The problem with this is the inherent risk of building hype the artist can't live up to with their first full studio album. J. Cole had this problem and I would argue Curren$y did as well. While their first major label studio albums were certainly \\"good\\", that's all they were, neither great nor exceptional like their mixtapes/independent albums were.<br /><br />Kendrick Lamar was in a similar position for me. I loved his mixtapes and his independently released Section.80 and Overly Dedicated albums as well as the Kendrick Lamar EP and they all come highly recommended for anyone looking to add a bit of new West Coast flavor to their rotation. But the problem was, at least for me, they were too good. I was left to wonder whether or not his first studio effort, good kid, m.A.A.d city could measure up. Fortunately, Kendrick has proven that he can not only measure up to the bar set by his previous efforts but propel the bar into orbit.<br /><br />One of the lead singles, Swimming Pools (Drank) is an excellent example of the depths of Kendrick Lamar's artistry. On the surface, this sounds like a typical club or radio joint that'll chart purely off of its catchy hook and deep, thumping bass line. But beneath the cunning disguise lies a story of peer pressure and alcoholism. Kendrick walks the tightrope between mass appeal and artistry with ease that evidences his genius in that he is able to appeal to both worlds without compromise.<br /><br />There are a few notable features that serve to amplify the messages relayed, such as MC Eiht's appearance on the track m.A.A.d city, a song about the perils of life in Compton featuring an appearance by one of Compton's gangster rap legends. But Kendrick is at his best when he's on his own. This is his album and his story and no one tells it better than him.<br /><br />The album's magnum opus of sorts is Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst, a 12 minute track split into two parts, the first featuring perspectives from two people from Kendrick's past, offering differing perspectives on the concept of having their story live on after death while the third verse the inner turmoil Kendrick deals with as an artist as he wrestles with remaining true to his art amidst the negative influences he has seen throughout adolescence. The second half deals with his fatigue of running and hunting, his tiredness from the endless cycle of violence so often seen in gang culture.<br /><br />Throughout the album, Lamar delves deep into his past, showing us where his inspiration comes from and what fuels his artistry. Short skits interspersed throughout the album, usually appearing at the end of songs serve to relay the album's \\"storyline\\", which is apparently based on true stories from Kendrick's past. Through the songs and the accompanying skits Kendrick weaves an interesting tale playing out as if on a tape deck, the album goes all round and back again, a cycle reflective of the cyclical nature of life.<br /><br />To say I merely like this album would be a tremendous disservice to it and the man behind it. This is an absolutely astounding album that deserves to be heralded as a modern classic. Kendrick Lamar has demonstrated that he has tremendous depth as an artist through intricately layered and meaningful lyrics that flow as smooth as velvet on top of some excellent production. This album is an absolutely brilliant total package that, at the risk of sounding hyperbolic (as if I haven't done enough of that already), constitutes a new paradigm for conscious hip-hop.<br /><br />Don't pirate good kid, m.A.A.d city. Don't stream it for free online. Buy it, like I did. This is the kind of hip-hop the industry needs more of and it needs our support.e tells it better than him.<br /><br />The album's magnum opus of sorts is Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst, a 12 minute track split into two parts, the first featuring perspectives from two people from Kendrick's past, offering differing perspectives on the concept of having their story live on after death while the third verse the inner turmoil Kendrick deals with as an artist as he wrestles with remaining true to his art amidst the negative influences he has seen throughout adolescence.

B003N7GATM|3.0|Let me start by saying that im a huge Nine Inch Nails/Trent fan. I own everything he/they've done and have seen them live more times than i can count. And that my be the/my problem. I'm comparing. This coul've/should've been a NIN album. The music is fantastic, the production incredible and lush, the lyrics amazing (especially 'A Drowning'), the vocal melodies are perfectly how Trent would sing, phrasing and all...its just that Mariqueen's vocals are...nice. Too nice. Sweet and perfect and...ultimately passionless. Almost spoken most of the time. No grit, no emotion no. I know this is unfair...this isn't supposed to be NIN. I know this. It just sounds like the Muzak version of Nine Inch Nails...the \\"Honey, here are some songs i wrote but you can sing them\\" version. Sonically and lyrically this would/should be one of the better NIN albums in the past few years. Instead it comes off as a less passionate/intense version of the band. There is NOTHING wrong with the CD and i love listening to it...it's just as dissapointing because of what it could've been with Trent singing. No impact...no emotional value. Again i know that is unfair. I wish that i had no idea Trent was involved because it's a ghost of things that could've been.

B000007XUQ|5.0|Grew up with the Carpenters and love there music. This Christmas cd has so many songs and perfect for the season, great buy,
B009K0OL06|5.0|This show has me hooked. Watched the first season on Netflix. I wasn't sure I would like rooting for a main character hell bent on revenge, so I dismissed the show at first. She has a more than a few redeeming human qualities, but I think I love a strong woman lead- she's both a bad-*** and a debutaunt.
B004UA8D2S|1.0|Bought it early as a Christmas gift for my brother and just found out that it doesn't play right and skips. Tried it on 3 different blu-ray players and it skipped on all three.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|This game is fun and challenging at the same time. It reminds me of a new age pinball game. Being able to get Jelly to flop at the correct angle will become a mission that you just can't seem to give up on.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game is ok but it is not amazing. I think that the creator should make it more interesting. please?
B00013M6NK|5.0|I have tried a less expensive generic version of this battery and was very dissatisfied after a few months of use. The battery would not last very long at all compared to the Nikon battery that came with the camera three years ago, in fact between the original after many charges and the replacement battery I can't tell if one lasts longer than the other. It was well worth spending the extra money.

B006ZDU7QI|2.0|&#34;Somebody That I Used to Know&#34; is a great, great song and an unexpected hit.  I really wanted to like the rest of this album but it just never grew on me.  If the hit track hadn't been such a standout, I wonder if I would have enjoyed the other songs more?  I will continue to follow Gotye because of his unique sound, but this album as a whole just didn't live up to the hype.

And, that's just (a fraction of) the grocery store!<br /><br />Welcome to the paradox of choice. As the author so aptly summarizes:<br />\\"When people have no choice, life is almost unbearable. As the number of available choices increases, as it has in our consumer culture, the autonomy, control, and liberation this variety brings are powerful and positive. But as the number of choices keeps growing, negative aspects of having a multitude of options begin to appear. As the number of choices grows further, the negatives escalate until we become overloaded. At this point, choice no longer liberates, but debilitates. It might even be said to tyrannize.\\" (p. 2)<br /><br />The book offers such a fascinating exploration of the confluence of factors leading to the \\"dark side\\" of choice:<br />\\"Clearly, our experience of choice as a burden rather than a privilege is not a simple phenomenon. Rather it is the result of a complex interaction among many psychological processes that permeate our culture, including rising expectations, awareness of opportunity costs, aversion to trade-offs, adaptation, regret, self-blame, the tendency to engage in social comparisons, and maximizing.\\" (p. 217)<br /><br />But, there is hope! After exploring the factors that lead to choice overwhelm, the author offers steps we can take to help overcome the \\"overload of choice\\" (pp. 221-235):<br />1. Choose when to choose<br />2. Be a chooser, not a picker<br />3. Satisfice more and maximize less<br />4. Think about the opportunity costs of opportunity costs<br />5. Make your decisions nonreversible<br />6.

B000W1TJY0|5.0|A blast from the past.  Getz was a cool cat before I was walking and is just as cool today as ever.  His passing makes the world just that much less smooth and wonderful.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This one seemed too familiar of Grisham's works of the past few years and seems to capture John's own fantasy ideal for revenge and escape. A page turner, but not much substance. In fact, Grisham almost brags about the lack of research in the epilogue.
B0095R6OBS|4.0|A funfest in less than 30 minutes.  The idea Tim Burton got this one past the stuffed suits at Disney just amazes me!  You can clearly see Burton's future direction in this early short subject and the peek is just plain fun to boot.
B0086DBE62|5.0|i love that Amazon rents movies on my Roku! Had been waiting to see this - you had it before netflix! Yay!
B005D63ICI|5.0|Awesome!  Just like every other season!  Quick and easy purchase.  I didn't want to pay for the dvd set knowing I would probably only watch it once.  I had borrowed the other seasons.
B00011CZRE|5.0|This is a great movie!  I love both of the leading characters.  I was glued to the television.  You'll love the suspense.
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love the other soundtracks to the Lord of the Rings movies and this one is no disappointment. Good to know there are two more coming in future years!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is a movie I fell in love with when I first saw it many years ago.  I decided to purchase it and add it to my collection after Whitney Houston died.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The case is nice and well made.  When you open the front cover, the Kindle screen comes to life.  Closing the cover puts the Kindle to sleep.  I like the protection afforded by such a good quality product.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Nice, easy read.  I read it while on vacation and it was perfect for relaxing my mind.  I would consider reading additional books by this author.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I've read, than immediately reread this novel two more times. It should be regarded as the quality benchmark in the fantasy genre. Honestly and masterfully written without any commercialism tricks like cliffhangers, proliferation of POV's, bloated narrative and sleazy romance vocabulary (e.g. butterflies in the stomach and similar atrocities). The story is extremely good, soundly structured, reasonably self contained, and, most importantly, beautifully and smoothly conveyed.<br /><br />It has left me with a profound addiction to the Raven's shadow universe. I hope that impending author's commercial success would not destroy his integrity and that the future installments of this series would be of the similar quality as Blood song.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Don't get it if you're looking for more than touchups though.  It will take small nicks out of a blade and keep the edge keen but anything more and you'll need something bigger.  Can't beat it for the price, this is a pocket sharpener for on the go
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked the Hunger Game Series.  My initial inclination was not to read the books -- the subject matter sounded to gruesome, but I overheard some teachers giving it high praise, so I read #1 and got hooked on reading the next two.

B003204MQS|5.0|isit true or not? that is our question. really good movie the movie starts out very slow, but it is needed information for the remainder of the movie
B00003CXB2|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is SUCH a classic, storied, iconic film!!!! Its sweeping scenes, cinematography, acting [by the magnificent Peter O' Toole-A TRULY CLASSIC PIECE OF CINEMA!!!! At the time this film was made, there had NEVER been anything like it made-and there never will be again!! An exquisite,entertaining, piece of true A-R-T! BRAVO!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. I loved how real the characters were and how the story makes you feel as though you know them personally and share their experiences. And Holder, oh my! This book took my breath away on many occasions! Bravo!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not even half way through the book I lost interest when I found out that she  was a virgin. Seriously?
B007H1HQW0|5.0|I purchased this after reading the reviews and watching the You Tube video. My son loves it and it works great!
B008469DGY|4.0|Needed a game to pass the time during a colonoscopy prep. WAS FUN with out to much stress. Could play with one hand.
B007SGM084|5.0|These books l would consider a must read, it's enlightening and informative.it sassy and holds your interests and most definitely a page turner.I believe both men and women will enjoy these books. I completed them in three days. Reminds me of the movie 8 degrees of separation but more in-depth and it does peeks the curiosity about a certain lifestyle.
B00005JY1O|5.0|I had to buy a new one because I wore out the original from 40+years ago,( undue care and attention ), and I couldn't be happier.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Fun and addictive game to pass the time with. However, it's one of those games you need to be rich to no successful at.
B005PK553C|5.0|This show had me on the edge of my seat the entire season . Actors and Actresses did a wonderful job. I would recommend this show to EVERYONE! seriously don't miss out on watching one of the best shows on television
B0099114WO|1.0|This was one of the most boring movies I've ever watched.  I kept hoping it would improve, but it dragged on and on and on.  As much as I like Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, they weren't able to redeem this movie.  I never developed any sympathy or interest in these two people and didn't really care whether they salvaged their marriage or not.  Complete waste of time.
B008M721MS|2.0|it would have been helpful if the instruction book was included.  I am still trying to figure out how to cancel a magazine before my 30 day trial is up. I have discovered that I do not like reading magazines with this ! It would also be nice if this thing came with a Sun block cover so it could be used at the beach!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the 3rd novel by Ms Hoover and I have read all three of them...at least twice.  I read Hopeless 3 times because I read it in one day the first time, then re-read it slower to make sure I didn't miss anything.  If you have read Slammed and Point of Retreat...this is more adult subject matter, though the main characters are teens.  It is well written and, while some of the plot you can guess from the amazing foreshadowing, there is some that punches you right in the heart strings.  You need to get to know Sky and Holder and go with them in this incredible journey.  You will definitely laugh, you will get mad, you will cry from sorrow and heartache.  BUT... You will rejoice in the fact that they went though this journey together.  READ IT already!  And follow Colleen Hoover on Facebook ...the reason I re-read it the third time is because she wrote a scene from Holders POV just for her fans!
B002SR2PKG|5.0|i love my kindle, never thought i would like an electronic book, but stephen king is my favorite author and 'It' was a great read
B00A4YVHXQ|1.0|I had to unsubscribe from this app.  It was horrible, would not load so gave up and unsubscribed.<br />Wish it had worked, sounded wonderful.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|***<br />Was a good reminder and I did highlight several new ideas that I will put into use.  Easy read! :)
B0039TAHMA|5.0|Epic, action packed, and worth watching. It has the same entertainment and high standards you would expect from the movie series!
B004DM0UII|1.0|App and reviews sounded great, esp. for free, but it never worked for me.  I downloaded it twice, uninstalling in between and rebooting phone, and still kept getting the weird 'ball bouncing on hard floor' sound and 'Android Media console died' message no matter what radio station I tried.  I got one to stream for a few seconds but it kept losing the connection and going on and off.  I'm on Verizon 4G with a very strong signal. so it's just an app that won't work for me.
B002XISFGS|4.0|Star Trek fans back thirty years ago were so thrilled to have the series resurrected as a movie that they wholeheartedly supported &#34;Star Trek the Motion Picture&#34; despite its many flaws.  Once the film did its duty by launching a series of better sequels, it fell into disrepute--so much so that the blu-ray release of the Star Trek movie trilogy started with the second film.  I bought the blu-ray of STMP just to have all the Star Trek films, but when I watched it to check out the quality of the blu-ray, I realized I liked the film much more than I remembered.  Yes, the focus is placed on the wrong characters, leaving the crew we love with too little to do;  the performances of Stephen Collins and Persis Khambatta are out of sync with the Star Trek style, which makes the film lag;  and the plot is rather transparent (the Enterprise crew may be ignorant of Voyager in the 25th century, but the audience gets what Vijar is light years before the big reveal).  Despite all that, I enjoyed much of the film, especially Kirk facing his foibles.  Most importantly, the blu-ray is really good looking, and definitely worth the money.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas sparks does it again! A good book can place you in the characters shoes, feel their emotions...Sparks is an AMAZING writer.
B005LN2Y1Y|5.0|&#34;Strictly Ballroom&#34; is a fabulous film that I've loved for years, so much that I have owned it progressively on videotape, laser disc, and DVD.  I waited for so long for it to come out on blu-ray, but to my surprise, it is still only available imported from another region.  Coincidentally, my player started malfunctioning, so I bit the bullet and bought a new all region player, which wasn't that much more expensive than a regular one anyway.  I immediately ordered the import blu-ray, and it does not disappoint.  Although the product details say there are no special features, there actually are a few, particularly a &#34;making of/behind the scenes&#34; featurette that is not on the American DVD.  If you are as fanatic as I am, you'll need to keep the DVD for its special features (not on the blu-ray).  If you love this film, and you're tired of waiting for a U.S. release, invest in an all region player and buy this right away.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked this book a lot! It actually made me think of things more. I can't wait to see the movie!
B007OWRBJK|3.0|For the hardcore Townsend fan, not necessarily the hardcore Who fan. Unlike much of his music, Pete's not always the easiet guy to like.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|We came into this series  late in the second season and are hooked!  I bought my husband the first two seasons for christmas and he was thrilled.  It was great to see it from the beginning.  Now I need to get the third season so we will be ready for the new one.  We love this show.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Exciting!  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br />Character development very good.  The plot leaves<br />you in a place of &#34;not knowing&#34; if the star character is<br />guilty or not guilty.  The movie swings your opinion<br />back and forth.
B007SGM084|5.0|Well, I should say this has been a real thrill ride full of everything I love in a book!  Romance, adventure, drama and suspence!  I simply can't  NOT recommend this trilogy!  Don't just start with buying the first book I wholly recommend buying the trilogy at once, as this is sure to please!
B009FB3XTA|4.0|This CD makes it obvious that the series is about to end.  Unlike previous Twilight soundtracks, this one has fewer songs that you want to listen to.  To put it plainly, not as great as the previous CD's.
B0086700CM|5.0|If your person will not move wile tilting, hold the power button for more than five seconds. If it does not work, make sure that you have no Windows open and make all'm programs be at their main menu.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Have all of the previous soundtracks from this saga.  I really like this one as well, although nothing tops the original soundtrack and the New Moon soundtrack.<br /><br />Still a LOT better than the final soundtrack.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Better than the movie, which I saw first in theatres when it first came out. Can't wait to read the next two.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and relaxing, well worth the money for a great puzzle. Runs great on Kindle Fire HD, HTC Incredible, ZTE Merit.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Classic Sparks novel. Well written and will pull at your heart strings, will make you cry, and make you smile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game .I  highly recommend this game because this is just awesome and it has ores unlike minecraft lite . You should also try minecraft editor.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a great read and it has very touching heartfelt moments as Charlie tells his life story to an anonymous friend. I recommend everyone read this fantastic book!
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This is an excellent album.  Very fun.  And I can't criticize it in any way on it's own terms.  However, it reminds me enough of the &#34;old crooners&#34; that I'd really rather listen to them for most of these songs.  I give it a 4-star recommendation for the 50-years-and-older.  The younger set would probably find it a five!
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, but I'd recommend the Brave temple run instead. Brave temple run is only $1. Disney Brave temple run is better because because it has cool Scottish scenery,and because it has inspiring Scottish music in the background.it looks very realistic.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a very interesting book that kept my attention until the end. Although written for younger readers, the themes explored are captivating for adults as well. I am looking forward to the next book.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I like it better than angry birds! I do think that it can be hard trying to build the crazy contraptions, but that's how it's meant to be. Great job by Rovio. : )
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and you can play it by yourself or with a partner.  It's an old game that my grandmother played.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book had so many words and information about all kinds of words and phrases in the big informational book.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Definitively a better movie than the first one. I really love it. I hope they will do the number 3.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I enjoy this game because you have a  fair chance of winning about one in four games ; at least that is  my average. Also I find it relaxing.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I own this movie. I saw it in the theater and bought the DVD as soon as it was available on Amazon. The movie by itself is very good, but the book is MUCH better! (Isn't that usually the case though)? The movie cut out entire chapters of the book and many of the characters were not as developed as they should have been. However, if you put the book aside, the movie is definitely worth watching.
B00979CS50|5.0|I agree completely -- the best I've heard from Neil and the gang for years, possibly since \\"Zuma\\".  Or maybe \\"Rust.  His guitar cuts like a knife, the lyrics aren't sappy (well, too sappy), and the Horse lumbers and thrashes along behind him.  Great stuff, good for your rock 'n roll soul.
0345536886|2.0|Having just finished the book, I am left with the feeling of still waiting for the actual plot to begin. I forced myself through the boring plot filler stories of the various characters, anxiously anticipating the real story behind the book - the reason for why John Grisham is as famous and acclaimed as he is. And it never appeared. Still, 88% into the book, I was yet to grasp the real story behind the book. Was those two cases all of it? It couldn´t be! There must be something more coming, something that will make me grip my kindle, lose my sleep just for the sake of finding out what is happening next. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I find Grisham´s writing incredibly unengaging. Easy to read? Sure! Gripping? Heck no! I didn´t care for the characters, I didn´t care for the plot, I certainly didn´t care much about the ending. I would draw lines between Grisham´s writing and TV that requires no brain activity to consume. Might be what some readers are looking for, but I look for books that teach me, engage me.<br /><br />The two stars are for the readability - I reserve my one stars for completely unintelligible books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its so fun get it you'll never be board again love it.  you'll love it. too and its so addicting.  best game I ever played.
B00AS1Q8FW|3.0|Just couldn't get into this movie especially with Tom the toughguy? He's better cast as a business world caracter. That's what i see, sorry.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book simply swept in and took me by surprise.  I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't this.  Hopeless completely pulled on my heart strings, and I turned to mush.  There are several dark and serious topics and yet there is such beauty/passion in the characters and writing in this book.  The story is so beautifully written...let's just call it an endearing...gripping...passionate...phenomenally fantastic read!  *Deep breath* *sign* Did I say BEAUTIFUL???  I read it in less than a day.<br /><br />I can compare it to the way I felt after reading Our Fault In The Stars by John Green...another fantastically beautiful read.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|There are few albums out that where every song is great, this is one of them.  I'm buying the other Mumford and Sons album next.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|After reading the reviews on this book I decided to give it a go. Based on the reviews you either love it or hate it. I also like that Warner Bros. bought the rights to it and will be making it into a movie. With that said....I fall into the \\"really like\\" category. I am a huge sucker for bad boys, and I liked the chemistry between the characters. Yes there is some \\"cheese\\" that I had to overlook because this is a young adult book. I have to admit I was sucked in immediately and finished in 2 days. The book has some language and mild sex but not in crazy detail so consider yourself warned. It's no literary masterpiece, but it is crack....and you just cannot stop;-)
B0019LY5IM|5.0|great movie at a great price, did not see it on tv, bought one of the seasons and wanted to see them all
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Innocence lost...hope lost...life lost.  Such a compelling, raw and emotional read from the voice of a deeply broken girl.  It shows you that one semi harmless act can create a dangerous 'snowball effect'.  I felt completely helpless reading this book because we all know Hannah DID commit suicide, and that there would be no 'knight in shining armor' moment.  To hear her isolation and how easily 'the signs' (her cries for help were ignored) by everyone...piers...family...teachers.  I see the future that she gave up on breaks my heart to know that this happens and there were things that could have been done to stop the downward spiral if 'we' would just take our eyes off of ourselves. I like the double narrative...seeing the same moment from 2 perspectives simultaneously.  On such a serious topic I like the 'end game' message of this story.  I cannot say that I enjoyed this book, but feel enlightened and humbled by it.  Definitely worth the read.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|great movie at a great price, wanted all the season's after seeing the 1st season.  I had heard it was good.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I LOVED this story. I laughed out loud and completely lost it crying. It's so rare that a book has such balance and consumes your heart. The story was beautifully written and I couldn't help but to fall in love with the characters. I found several quotes throughout the book that grabbed me and wouldn't let me go.<br /><br />Notable quotes (there are so many in this book)<br /><br />\\"That's the thing about pain...it demands to be felt\\".<br /><br />\\"You don't get to choose if you get hurt in this world...but you do have some say in who hurts you. I like my choices.\\"
B009GX6SSK|5.0|This is the best season yet of NCIS: Los Angeles.  So worth buying the episodes I miss on TV.  I recommend this show to anyone that likes action cop shows but likes some humor added to it (and not the trauma drama/whiney romance of certain other shows).
0062197266|5.0|Into The Darkest Corner was a dark, thrilling read that kept a constant flow of tension running through me the entire time that I was reading.  The story is told in two parts: one part is Catherine's memories and the other part is the present day Catherine as she struggles to deal with those memories and adjust.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell you more than that as I don't think it's necessary and because this is one of those books where less is more.  From the very first page the author creates this atmosphere that is filled with tension, fear, and suspense.  It made for such a dark reading experience because every turn of the page left me waiting for something to happen.  For the ball to drop so to speak.  I began to feel the fear that was a constant presence in Catherine's life.  I knew that something bad was going to happen and it was mainly just a matter of when.  It made every page filled with suspense and creepiness.  Wow!  For this being a debut the author did an AMAZING job with the atmosphere in this book.  It was a presence entirely of its' own!<br /><br />Another thing that I enjoyed about this book was the author's portrayal of Catherine.  I much preferred reading about present day Catherine and watching as she learned to deal with her OCD.  I thought that the author did a really great job of writing Catherine's fears so realistically until the point where you almost felt them yourself.  I loved that there wasn't an easy answer to her problems.  I found that I really connected with her as a main character because of this.  While I didn't always care for the Catherine in her memories or agree with her choices, I cared about what happened to her.  It made for a really solid read!<br /><br />Overall, I am quite anxious to read more by this author.  I'm extremely pleased that I had the chance to read this book and will definitely be recommending it.  I've got to honestly tell you that if I hadn't read so many amazing thrillers last year that this book would have made my top ten reads.  It was that good!  There were just too many others though so I didn't end up choosing it.  I would highly recommend this one with one warning:  there is violence (lots of it) and it is a pretty dark book at times.  If any of that bothers you then it might not be a book for you.  Otherwise like I said, I highly recommend and really enjoyed it myself!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  A tense thriller that kept me glued to the pages!<br /><br />Disclosure:  I was lucky enough to be sent a copy of this book for review thanks to the publisher and am reviewing it as part of a TLC book tour!  Thoughts are my own as always :)d have made my top ten reads.  It was that good!  There were just too many others though so I didn't end up choosing it.

B00AECGQF2|5.0|its so cool you have to get it<br />LOL getting  it look at the photos<br />isn't cool I love it if you don't<br />well its ok
B009O2XY12|2.0|Fun and addicting until...you reach a point that is not winnable unless you buy additional balls, extras, whatever. The prices on those extras change with each level too. Boo!
0307454894|5.0|After seeing the film and being completely caught up in it. I had to read the book and I am so glad that I did.<br /><br />The story centres on Michael \\"Kid\\" and Frau Smitz and is in three parts. The first part focuses on the love story, the second focuses on the trial of Frau Smitz and her role in the SS where Michael is a law student and the final part focuses on the time when Frau Smitz is in jail serving life and Michael sends her tapes of him reading and helping her learn to read and write.<br /><br />The story is so moving and I couldn't stop reading it. I was in tears watching the film but the tears didn't come. However I was so caught up in the book I was breathless at some points. The writing style was easy to follow, the fact that the chapters were very short made it very easy to read and the pages just flowed by.<br /><br />I was caught up with the characters and the visions the book details were easy to picture.<br /><br />For me the story was moving and as I mentioned above breath-taking. Some books are ones that leave you thinking them over and this is how The Reader has left me. I also find that as I watched the film first I was able to picture things and I will be talking about this book for a long time. I actually feel privileged to have been given the chance to read it, if that makes sense?<br /><br />I would give The Reader 5/5.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am quite pleased, wonderful show.  Quality of the DVD was good, though used. Maggie Smith is brilliant in this production
B00540G3G6|5.0|I've heard how others say this movie doesnt really show the 3D. Well, their wrong plain and simple. I had no problem seeing the 3D even in the dark shaded parts of the movie. It's as wonderful now as it was without this feature.<br />If you love the movie and have a 3D TV, then treat yourself to this gem.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Pretty decent movie. Started kind of slow but the action was good.  No difference really with this movie and the original Bourne series. Still making toy soldiers.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|I expected this book to be a light and amusing story of little import. I was wrong. It turned out to be quite a deep and moving work of philosophy as well as an engaging story. As I began it, it rapidly turned from a trivial and humorous tale into a heart-warming story, certainly amusing but also one with characters I cared about and emotions I understood. I really enjoyed this book.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|I was very excited to have watched Les Miserables this past Christmas. I had become a huge fan since I was introduced to it by a very close friend of mine more than 2 years ago. Since then, I have learned mostly all the songs and I would sing them from time to time. After watching the movie, I wanted to have the soundtrack and I was happy to know that I could buy it on amazon. Upon purchasing the soundtrack, I was disappointed that a lot of songs were not included. Songs important to me such as, \\"Who am I?\\", \\"Fantine's Arrest\\", \\"In My Life\\" (Cossette), \\"Do You Here The People Sing?\\" and plenty more. It is my opinion as a fan of Les Miserables that cutting songs out from the soundtrack is doesn't tell the whole story but is a also robbery of the performances. It is also my opinion that such songs give continuity to the story no matter how non-essential it may seem to be. If all the songs were in the stage show, play or movie, it should be in the soundtrack as well. This review is not about the performance of the actors nor is this a movie review. Everybody has their own opinions but I will say it was awesome to hear and watch Hugh Jackman as Val Jean. I also like how they didn't make it to \\"stagey\\" in the movie. I enjoyed the movie as much as I enjoyed the stage shows. The point is, the album is a bit of a let down considering some of the great performances and songs from the movie was left out of the soundtrack. A good soundtrack for the performances alone but ultimately very incomplete. If you are a Les Mis fan, I highly recommend you read the track list before you buy.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is simple, works well, and looks nice. The weather feature is a nice added bonus...and all for free. Yay.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son, who requested it. He was very pleased with the Community First season.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Not the same story line as the first season ,but still great show. I cant wait to see the rest of season 2 episodes.
B009A882D0|5.0|great CD set has all the classics plus the live cuts... great selections. I would recommend to anyone who like these guys
B000I0QL82|4.0|I love the music, dancing, and the fabulous talent.  Bing Crosby croons &#34;White Christmas&#34; like no one else can. The love story is sweet, too.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  I had seen it years ago but wanted to see if it stood the test of time.  It did.  To watch the decline of Matt Damon's character is wonderful.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven is an excellent book. Well-written and fascinating. The author doesn't grand-stand and leaves it up to the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|This is a very well written and well acted program.  Jessica Lange really shines and the show wouldn't work without her.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My granddaughter loves Taylor Swift so I was pleased to find this at a great price when I couldn't find it locally.
B00005JPUN|2.0|I found this movie slow and boring.  Though I have five children of my own, I have great difficulty in being entertained by movies in which children play a significant role.<br />It was predictable and not worth my time (money was not important since it was very inexpensive). I wanted to see it after having seen the original directed by Don Siegel (vastly superior) and the remake with Don Sutherland (acceptable).
1609611543|4.0|I use this book more for meal plans & recipes. It was not a good read. I had a hard time staying interested.
B00933JF74|4.0|If you can't do sim city on your phone this is a good substitute. Addictive and fun and well worth the money.
0470503696|4.0|I read a few of the pages and already felt smarter. Can't wait to put this book into action.<br />I think it will be a great help for my programming role this year
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is very fun and it has very many choices to play from. I would recommend it for other children who like random games because not all kids like to play one game all the time
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I have never read a book that made me think so much and believe in the impossible. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life. It's truly perfect and on my worst days it makes me feel happy.
B008602KQI|4.0|I know this movie was well reviewed and was a decent &#34;hit&#34; in the theaters, but glad I waited to see it on DVD.<br /><br />Not outstanding, but decent entertainment
0486274268|5.0|This is perhaps one of the best animal drawing books I've ever seen. Hultgren has a great sense of gesture and form. His drawings really do come alive. He skillfully explains fundamentals such as weight and anatomy very well.<br /><br />This isn't another one of those run-of-the-mill how-to-draw books you'd find at Michael's. This book is something that  professionals would recommend to people who are very serious about their art.
B004EK91LQ|4.0|Great movie, if you like dance movies. Keeps your interest in current up to date dance moves. Would watch again.
B004SBX112|5.0|Fun and entertaining! Kids love it! Some levels are challenging making you really think! Adults can also enjoy this game!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Loved this movie at the theater, wanted to add it to my movie collection. Full of great action and Tom Cruise's boundless energy!
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I did not expect to find a well written missle from a dog.  However, I was presently surprised and would recommend this to anyone wanting some warmy fuzzy feelings after dragging through emotional turmoil.
B00A757EFW|2.0|[[ASIN:B00A757EFW PAC-MAN -LITE-]] ugh can' t get my game apps ugh.why doesn't' any game apps. work for my kindle fire or fire he?
B007QNRMUU|4.0|I like his music because it is upbeat and positive. Some of the songs seem a little predictable, but overall I like it and after repeated listening there are some that will likely become favorites.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was nice to read it was very funny and it was a book I recommend to 5 of my friends
B0076DELIG|5.0|Well, I was slightly disappointed in a few loose ends.....but maybe these will reappear in the next adventure.  As usual, Harry just pisses everyone off, and I love that he does.  Personally I could reread all my Michael Connelly over and over as I love this character that I feel I know so well.  He never seizes to always be on the edge with EVERYONE, and annoy his superiors!  My personal interest may be odd as I was married to an LAPD officer for almost 31 years.  THEY are definitely a sub culture unto their own from a very intimate look!  Michael Connelly nails it with his rendition of Harry's escapades in his job, his relationships, his partner, and his ego.  Let's face it, whatever Harry does if you are a fan, we are all gonna read it no matter what!  Just can't get enough of Harry.  In my mind, Harry is a friend of mine for 40 years who worked Hollywood Homicide, and Organized Crime in real life and who lives quietly now away from the drama. Often we discuss what went on in the 70's and 80's and then have to check our blood pressure because time has not ever erased the moments of impact. It is why I can read the fictional Harry and enjoy him, as the real life I dealt with is always just below the surface waiting to erupt.<br />It's a definite recommend to all the Harry fans!  Can't wait for the next installment.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great Christian Movie I loved it It keeps your attention and you aren't waiting long for the movie to either get better or not.I really liked Courageous and if you are a true Christian you will love the movie to so give it a try I did and feel in love Thanks to all
B007J4T2G8|5.0|after I got started on book one , I had to get books 2 and 3, just had to see how the story would ultimately end up
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I downloaded this app onto my kindle fire1st generation. The application does not save the page I was last on when using it to read a book.  I have to remember what page I was on and scroll through to find it again.  The page memory works on the iPad, so maybe its just the technology???? Other than that it is just like the desktop version
B007KOMTUI|5.0|We were hooked on Sopranos and equally hooked on this. The character development is excellent--each one is deep enough that even though you don't like some of the choices they make, you still can like/appreciate the character. I recommend this series for mature audience.
B006LSZECO|4.0|These two people are totally crazy!  I enjoyed the the book just to see what would happen next.  Very entertaining.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I wish all games were as stimulating and addicting as this one.<br /><br />It's your basic \\"Bejeweled\\" game, but with a purpose!!<br /><br />It can be a bit aggravating when you try to get those deep frozen ones unlocked... or get those certain prized pieces away from the little stone square(s)... or get away from those black rock things (coal?).<br /><br />Eh, but I guess it's all part of the challenge -- right?<br /><br />Beautiful graphics.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Arrived in time for Christmas. Played in ps3 and looks great. Love the trilogy.  Would recommend this purchase to anyone loving adventure
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My kids love this game and I like how it incorporates your imagination into the game.  Its worth the 2 bucks!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book is the best book and it's great to see the best of the world words from the book and it's great to read the book and I love this book and it's words.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|This blue-ray version was wonderful, it brought me back to my childhood and the wonderful Christmas' I had.  I would recommend buying this version for sure.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|I like the elevated design. They are weighted enough that they won't tip and rest on the heads easily. They seem well made, but my one complaint is the color scheme. I would prefer a standard black or grey, but I understand many people like specific colored kitchen equipment. But most of those people have a color theme going on, and I'm not sure how many people really have a rainbow color going on. But perhaps if you are stuck in the kitchen all day, these fun colors might be the most excitement you've seen in weeks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless was amazing!! It consumed me from beginning to end. I dont write a lot of reviews but i felt i had to comment on this one. Skye and Holder are amazing characters with a love that takes your breath away. Its a MUST read!
B00004YRQA|4.0|i bought this as a christmas present. it came on time and seemed to be the product i ordered. havent used it yet to see if it works correctly
034580404X|5.0|I think this was a very interesting set of books.  My one friend recommended that I read this entire set.  She said once you start you won't be able to put them down.  She was write.  They are good.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|My favorite Match 3 game so far. I played it through once and I'm planning to do it again.<br />If you like Match 3s make sure you play this one. I found it to be more difficult than most, which made it all the more fun. My game is much improved because of  it. I play on a Kindle Fire.
078322611X|5.0|excellent show. got it for my husband who loves it. he has watched it numerous times.i would recomnend this to everyone.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Well Found a whole new time-suck.  Can't say how many times I've played until Kindle Fire said &#34;give me a break and charge my battery.&#34;  Sure got the carpal tunnel firing.  Having trouble with some of the levels, but such is life.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Love these movies! So glad that all three were available on blu ray for such a reasonable price. The shipping was timely and it arrived in perfect condition.
0810994739|5.0|My grandson is 12 and way more into video games then reading but he really enjoys these books, so I give high marks to a book that can get him to read it!  By the way...I enjoyed it too! ;)
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was probably one of the best books that I have read in years!!  Lots of twists and turns!  I read the book in one day.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I love this set.<br />Totally worth the money.<br />Honestly some of the best films I have seen.<br />One of the greatest series ever.<br />Anyone interested in history or World War 2 will love this.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|The Dark Knight Rises:<br />This was a Christmas gift for a family member and they are very pleased with the movie.<br />Sherry
B005RUUUAI|5.0|We waited, we watched, and really enjoyed the series! We are hooked on the series!! Waiting for the next season to start!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book will completely absorb you. It´s sad but not heart breaking and touching but real - read it. If you like a good story, you'll like this.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|the FREE game that keeps on giving. so many options and levels. game does not bog up or freeze like others.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book had me head over heels wondering what would happen next. I highly recommend this book if you read the first book in the Theodore Boone series.
B007XUMHQK|5.0|quicksilver music arrived intact, speedy delivery, the cd itself sounds great, look forward to ordering more music. expect with confidence all orders to be of the same.
B0091LS07E|5.0|First ofall she is the most beautifull woman and she always coming up with something different. She is a legend as well!!
B00005N6RU|1.0|I don't understand why I have to pay postage back when I paid postage to get something that will NOT WORK!
0446554995|5.0|One of best in series. Ten times better than last novel. My wife read it and couldn't put it down.
B00908DDZM|5.0|This should seriously be the CD of the year. Macklemore is a genius, and he doesn't have to rap about women and drugs and partying in every song. There is a lot of meaning behind his lyrics, and I wish we could see more of that in the rap culture. As for shipping, it was very fast (though it seemed like forever because I was anticipating this album so much!)
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the Eagles perform live in 2011, and was thrilled to see that they had maintained such high quality over their 40-year career.  This recording of a concert performed several years earlier is very similar to the one I saw, with beautiful, spot-on renditions of the songs so many of us love.<br />The quality of the video is excellent, and the focus is on the performance, where it should be, rather than on distracting background commentary.<br />I recommend this to any Eagles fan.  You won't be disappointed.
0345803485|1.0|Killed my brain cells. Would not recommend. Unless you read it in Geroge Takei's voice, then you'll have the problem of laughing and crying so loud people will think you're having a mental breakdown.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This hilarious movie always gets us into the Christmas spirit, and never fails to crack us up no matter how many times we see it.  We finally got tired to trying to find it on TV and being interrupted by commercials, so we ordered it from Amazon.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|My daughter is obsessed with Grease!  It's sooo much fun to watch her enjoy it<br />the way I did as a kid.  Awesomeness!!
B004DM0UII|1.0|cant use it.  there is no amazon apps on my kindle.  and apparently now way to get the app or I don't feel like searching for hours to find it
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A terrifically fun book. The plot has been covered by plenty other reviews. I just wanted to pitch in my two cents. Read the sample offering in an hour, had me hooked so I ordered it. I am usually a slow reader but I couldn't stop reading this. I flew through it quicker than Parzival's mod-DeLorean. A great read, a great experience, and a rewarding finish.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|We got Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; for the family and my wife and two daughters loves Angry Birds game and one of them is always playing the game.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like to play this game.  It reminds me of the carnival games I played when I was a kid. The only bad thing is it takes a long time to get more coins. You only get 50 coins every like 8 hours. Buying coins is an option, but I think its a waste of money.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've been on a really lucky bender of excellent books lately. And Hopeless somehow managed to top them all.<br /><br />Too often I read these squeeing five star reviews where the reviewer doesn't ever manage to tell you why they loved the book so much. What was so awesome about the character's and the story. What made them squee?<br />And those reviews drive me nuts. Because as a reader of reviews I want to know if there's something in the book that will appeal to me!<br /><br />Give me something dammit!<br /><br />And here I am, completely at a loss for words, because words alone cannot express the deep, profound awesomeness of this book.<br />It was so perfect, so heartbreakingly beautiful and agonizing and funny and serious and every damn thing you could ever want from a book that I'm gobsmacked.<br /><br />So here's the best I can do..<br /><br />I loved this book so much that not only did I read it in one day (ignoring all else, including sleep) I read it again right after I finished it.<br />I also highlighted half the damn book because Colleen's writing is just epically full of win that I wanted to hug it.<br /><br />I sent it to my bestest friend with the note that I envied her being able to read it for the first time.<br /><br />I will no longer be able to use the words \\"best couple ever\\" for another couple in a review, because nobodies no how will ever come close to Sky and Holder.<br /><br />And still that tells you nothing does it? ::sigh::<br /><br />Sky is amazing, and funny and so centered. So secure in who she is that you just can't help but love her and be in awe of her and her amazing wisdom.<br />Holder is just so beautifully imperfectly real and brave. He's tortured by his past and the loss of two people he loved more than life. He's confused and amazed by his feelings for Sky. But he knows more than anything else he wants her in his life and he leaves no doubt as to the depth of his feelings.<br /><br />And what ensues is breathtaking. The burgeoning romance, the humor, the deep connection that these two have is just epic.<br /><br />Be warned, there's real darkness in this book, the unbelievable pain and heartache of betrayal and loss. It will break your heart, and just when you think the last bomb has dropped..you're wrong, there's still another.<br /><br />But this is at its heart a love story. A beautiful, tragic, awesomely perfectly imperfect love story.<br /><br />Read it. Carve out a day because once you climb into this world you will not want to climb out.<br />And even when you do finally crawl out, you'll feel disoriented because the characters that Collen Hoover has created are just too REAL...to not be real.
0547848412|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT BOOK AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AS AN EXCELLENT READ - FULL OF PHILOSOPHY AND I INTEND TO READ IT AGAIN.  I ALSO SAW THE MOVIE AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT AS WELL-BUT READ THE BOOK FIRST!

0143119680|4.0|Read in October, 2012<br /><br />format<br /><br /> Hardcover (edit)<br /><br />review<br /><br /> A Discovery Of Witches - Deborah Harkness<br /><br />I really liked this book very intriguing pairing a vampire with a witch instead of a vampire and human. Some parts of the book had reminded me of the other popular Vampire books the Twilight Series. Diana Bishop comes from a long line of witches in which she has basically been in her eyes a non-practicing witch. Diana stumbles upon a magical manuscript which has unlocked at her touch. Now every creature has been intrigue by this manuscript and the higher powers will stop at nothing trying to rectrieve it. Diana has aligned herself with a vampire and the two try to find the mystery behind the manuscript before the Congretion finds them

B008602KQI|5.0|Read in April, 2012<br /><br />format<br /><br /> Hardcover (edit)<br /><br />review<br /><br /> The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />This was an awesome book!!! Could not put it down! In fact I read it in one day. \\"The Hunger Games\\" is set in the future. Where as each an every year the Capitol holds a lottery system for all children once they hit twelve - eighteen to be entered into a death match. A boy and a girl are chosen from each of the twelve districts to compete. The only person standing is hailed the winner.<br /><br />Katmiss never thought that her younger sister would have been chosen. She did the only thing to save her life by volunteering herself instead. Katmiss figures she had more of a chance in outsmarting the rest of her competitors than her sister would have.<br /><br />Katmiss becomes close with her teammate Peete and gains an ally from<br />Rue a girl from district 11. Together they work together as a team and learned from one another to survive the games.<br /><br />I can't wait to read the other two books in \\"The Hunger Games\\" series. Also looking forward to watching the movie based on the book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this for my daughter.  It's the only thing she has played since.  She will not put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really enjoyed the book - it was a complex page turner and had many twists and turns that were not expected.<br /><br />Yes, there were a few story arcs that might have been a little bit over the top, but I accepted it, because overall, the book had a very fresh and innovative approach to telling a &#34;whodunit&#34; story.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if i hadn&acute;t frozen up 3x. But no harm done as everything saved where I was, got out and back in. Loved this game. The story is fantastic and moves alongnicely. Played smooth on kindle hd. Well thought out, not a lot of needless running around. Several hidden object games that were the perfect length, not too long, progressively more difficult, great zoom and hints. Great soundtrack. If only they could all be like this!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I'm sure glad I did! Saw the whole thing in a marathon weekend (along with Season 1) and got others hooked as well. Even if you don't think you like period pieces, this series appeals on all kinds of levels.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I can play this game all day. I love all the challenges and quests. It's a very fun and entertaining game.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|You all know the movie. Insane things happen in it. I love it. You love it. Watch it! In all seriousness though, it's a solid movie that's really well put together. Too bad they only made 3 of these things.
159562015X|4.0|A must read if you want to know where to focus your energy and what tasks to delegate to others.
B006PAZMMK|3.0|At first I hated dubstep. Now I'm open to it. It's the new shiny toy of music. Keep an open mind people. Rock suffered an uphill battle too. Now look at it.
038532653X|5.0|I was a little hesitant to read this at first, mostly because it was recommended to me by a person who does not share my taste in books. It sat on a shelf for maybe a week. It's constantly been in my hands ever since.<br /><br />The characters are very different from what you might find in a \\"normal\\" book.<br /><br />Michael is most definitely a ten year old who has had to grow up very quickly. He views the world like a ten year old, (or at least how I did when I was ten) which leads to a bit of an odd narrative, but once you fall into the rhythm of his viewpoint, the story is much easier to relate to. Kudos to David Almond for being able to get inside the head of a younger person!<br /><br />Mina is wise beyond her years and is more aware of the world around her than most people would expect a kid her age to be. She teaches Michael to be more aware as well. An interesting aspect of her overall character is that she doesn't go to school, and that's most likely affected her and the way she thinks. She's really refreshing.<br /><br />Skellig was overall my favorite character. He is a man (sort of) who's lost all hope. He does not want to live, does not want to be found, and believes he doesn't want to be cared for, either. He was brought back from the brink. In the end, I didn't care to know what he was, because that would've ruined the magic of it all. Mr. Almond really practiced restraint in not revealing it.<br /><br />The plot overall was a little scrambled, but still somehow worked within the general story. This was a very introspective book, without room for much action. Yes, it was slightly depressing at times. This is not the kind of book you want to read when you're in a dark mood and want to be cheered up. Except the ending. The ending was sweet and a bit hopeful.<br /><br />The description was lovely, but sometimes a little too in-your-face for my taste, like when Skellig was described eating.<br /><br />The entire book was just one big metaphor--sometimes the characters seemed a bit lost in it. It could've been just a bit more subtle at times, but at others, the metaphor flew under my radar until now.<br /><br />In my opinion, the dialogue could've been a little better, but then again, it fit the book.<br /><br />Overall, Skellig was an amazing book, with a lot of power in the prose and an ability to really move the reader and make you care about the situations the characters are in. It makes you question many things in your life and made me want to change things in others' lives for the better. I recommend this to those of us that love to spend a good portion of the day just thinking and reading and sitting quietly while observing the world around us.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review!<br />~Harpingonforeverthe characters seemed a bit lost in it.

B009B08LJ2|5.0|I'm a big fan of Batman. With that being said, YES I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! I loved Tim Burton's version, but this one was an excellent evolution of the franchise. Acting was on par. Action was on par. What more could you want?
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved the book it was so funny and good my favorite part was when the girls changed the fundraiser by \\"just a little\\" I read it in three days and I am a slow reader I give it a \\"thumbs up\\"
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|This game has it all. Great graphics, fantastic storyline, eerie sound effects, awesome music score. It's beautiful through and through. Love the fact that there are voice overs in the game as well as sub-titles. The gameplay is very smooth. Even those of you who are new to HOS games will find it fun. I'm waiting for the next Nightmares from the Deep!
1562827693|2.0|This was not the book I thought I was ordering as there are two books the same title but different authors.  Recommend you make sure you have the right author.  Great book I suppose if you are a Budhist..  Great price though!
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I enjoyed playing this game. Love the fact that it has different types of HOS features such as finding differences. The story line is good although I felt that it could have been better. My reason for giving the game four stars is that some of the mini-games were far too easy whereas others were tediously frustrating to align. Fans of HOS games will find it very entertaining. It isn't as good as Letters from Nowhere 1 and 2. If G5 Entertainment makes a 2nd one, I hope they will keep this in mind.
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Love Dexter<br />My son always tapes Dexter for me but forgot to get the first 6 on the 6 th season , so bought it and loved it . Dexter is my favorite show.0<br />Ellie Mintet
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I would say this story should have had a little more at the end but other than it was okay.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I will eventually understand how it works, but the print on the instructions was so small that I needed a magnifying glass to read.  I am very serious about this.  I was almost impossible to read and I struggled even with the magnifying glass.  Even the young teens in my family thought it was a joke.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I was just looking around for apps with my 3 year old sister who loves mmy little pony and she saw it and she was all like aww my little pony I love that game and so I downloaded it for her yummy ya
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app super simple and great to use while I'm grocery shopping balancing my check book or just paying bills
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If a person does not wish to get hooked, he/she should not watch this.  The scenery is wonderful, the acting is superb, the character study is constantly presenting new twists and turn.  I have had to rethink my assessment many times as these characters have developed.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I have watched and re-watched this movie.  I love Cher and Christina.  The story is cute and the songs are awesome!
B008FYZIVY|4.0|I love this show!!The acting is wonderful,and it keeps you so interested!And it's so cool the different view points of the servants and the people who live in the house.
1451629192|5.0|This is one of the most honest, raw books I have ever read in my entire life. Jaycee is not very good at her writing skills, but that makes it even more truthful and forward. Her story of forgiveness and survival is extremely admirable about this woman. In a way it sounds as if this is writen from a child still, since she never had the opportunity to grow up normally and have a cotidial lifestyle as other young women did. I really do wish her and her daughters the best and look up to her. Much respect for Jaycee, keep it up!!
B00AE6SS5O|3.0|very strange disconnection from reality and Christmas as we have come to know it. deffinately not reccomended for children whose delicate ideals of the season can be marred by so strange a concept as this one. kind of wonder what the developer was smokin'
B005VPRDAY|5.0|My daughter LOVES this lego set! This is her first LEGO set and Santa brought it to her. We had fun putting together all of the elements of the set even though it took almost 4 hours to complete. She was attentive and determined to complete the picture on the front of the bin and found it easy to follow the step by step instructions that are included. My only warning is that there are a BUNCH of super tiny pieces that would not need to be around a little person unattended. Overall, she is pleased and so am I!
B002VWNID6|5.0|Love it.  Very happy with it.  The only thing that is a little weird is that you have to flip the DVD over halfway through to get the second part of the movie.  Very Strange, I have never had to do that with a DVD before and the movie isn't even that long.
B003NTSBUG|3.0|This movie kept on skipping and freezing. I didn't end up watching the whole thing due to technical problems. Waste of money.
B0051OZ564|1.0|This was by far the worst movie i ever attempted to watch. Don't waste your money or your time. Amazon has many good titles. I suggest you choose one of those instead.
B009NF54ZE|4.0|A very fun and entertaining hidden object game. The puzzles are fun and you can enlarge the screen. to find the objects.Would. purchase. more of the Pirate. Adventure. games.
B0001VV1GK|5.0|Our 1 1/2 year old twins have become obsessed with cars. Their Grandma has an old Fisher Price garage/ramp that they love to play with. This toy is about 3 feet tall, and has survived 20 years/6 boys of play. We looked high and low for something similiar, and could not find a thing.<br />We were thinking seriously about buying the Fisher Price rampway. (Which we ironically recieved as a Christmas gift, so I may compare the two.) Boy are we glad we didn't!<br /><br />I had decided to buy the Plan Toys garage for a couple of reasons.<br />1. It is wood, seemingly more durable. A toy to last for generations.<br />2. The toy is built to grow with our boys. Lots of extras to buy.<br />3. I appreciated the companies' eco-friendly actions.<br /><br />Now for the toy...Did it live up to my expectations?<br />-The assembly was a little more time consuming than the Fisher Price model. Nothing too difficult though. The extra assembly is what makes it more durable. I think it took me about 20 minutes to put it together, and the first 5 of those minutes was spent figuring out where my husband left the screwdriver. I did take the advice of other reviewers and glued the ramps on. I recommend gluing the ramps, otherwise they may be lost in a few days.<br />-This toy is extremely durable. Christmas morning, one of our 30+ pound twins promptly sat on the toy. Sat right on top of the garage. No ill effects to the toy. I see this toy as a toy that our grandchildren will be able to play with. (The fisher price model falls apart a lot!)<br />-Fun factor- Christmas day my boys, and my 2 1/2 year old nephew sat at their table, and played for hours. This toy is the first toy they go to in the morning, and it is played with throughout the day. Most of our cars work very well with this garage. The only exception is the elevator. Some cars fit, some do not (not a big deal though.)<br />The only thing I would change about this garage is the gas pump location. It is difficult for the boys, and mama to pump gas. I also would have liked something that was a little taller (like grandma's old toy), but since this garage is not geared for the age of my boys, I am okay with the size.<br />*This toy does come with smaller parts, cars people, etc. I just put the smaller accessories away until they are old enough to safely play with them.<br /><br />I am so happy with the Plan Toys garage. I plan on adding on to this piece for birthdays, holidays, etc. If you are looking for a substantial, durable, fun, eco-friendly toy that will last for years- I STRONGLY suggest investing in the Plan Toys line of toys. (In retrospect, if you want a cheaply made pile of junk that your kids will tire of quickly- buy the Fisher Price Loops n Swoops.)
B009E3EY38|5.0|I waited 5 years to see this and it was worth the wait.If this is Led Zeppelins swan song (pun Intended) they went out on a high note.The greatest concert I never went to.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|If you're looking for a book as good as Fifty Shades, YOU ARE WASTING YOUR TIME. There is none like that and no other like Christian Grey. `Bared to you'  is not even close.<br />I've just finished the second book of the Crossfire series. I was disappointed with the first but decided to read the second before writing my review. And it was even worse!!!!<br />SPOILERS<br />I really wanted to ask the writer if she really thinks it's okay to kill someone because they are a liability. Yes, I know, Nathan was going to kill Eva. But if Gideon knew that, he could have done something other than to kill him. What if Brett, Eva's ex- boyfriend, also had videos or pictures to use against her? Gideon was just going to kill him too? You may be thinking I'm just saying this because I don't have a relative who went through the same thing that happened to Eva, but I don't think committing another crime is the right way to fix the problem. Nathan was probably totally f***ed up himself, that's why he was the way he was. I thought Eva would be devastated and disgusted to discover that Gideon was a murderer, but instead, she thanked him!!! This book should be forbidden. It encourages people to make justice with their own hands. According to Gandhi, \\"an eye for an eye will make the whole world blind\\".<br />Besides, half of the story was really boring. Eva's misery over why Gideon had left her was irritating and repetitive (Yes! They weren't together half of the story). I wanted to shake some sense in her e tell her to kick his `behind'. The author tried very hard to write something similar to Fifty Shades, even the names of the men started with the same letters - C G / G C - but it just didn't work.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|This is a very creative, never boring CD.  It reminds me of Aerosmith's Nine Lives in the way that each song is so unique, it's like going on an adventure.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I have used this product on my phone and on another tablet.  It works great an keeps the battery working at its max.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I've probably seen this movie a dozen times in b&w and love it, but to see it in full, natural looking color is really amazing!  Makes this classic even better.
B003VS0CYC|5.0|Nice blu ray and packaging. My husband is a huge Robocop fan and he loved it. It arrived very quickly, too.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Love this classic film, still amazes me how they &#34;colorize&#34; these old films. Natalie wood is  a peach of a young actress in this! Recommend this to anyone!!
1452110581|5.0|This was a present that went over quite well.  The recipient loved this gift and found the book very amusing.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Been watching from the beginning, and am totally hooked on this show. Kurt Sutter, you are amazing!!!! Excellent acting, great story lines and suspense. Even got friends at work hooked on the show!! Can't wait to get season 5 on DVD!
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|A good movie to watch on a big screen TV with the surround sound turned up!  Not worth the cost of seeing it in the theater.
B009MF5BXK|4.0|a little crazier the the original but still fun to watch. will surely add to wife's collection of action adventures.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|It was a gift for my dad and he loved it.  One of his favorite holiday movies.  Which he always seems to miss each year.  Now he will have it always.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I only have used this app a handful of times, there is a huge selection of sounds to choose from. We just use the fan one, great white noise.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I've never read a book quite like it and I loved every page of it. This hands down deserves five stars!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|It's just a really great game, on that I can play for hours.It's simple, HaOC is a awesome single player and mutiplayer game.

0345803485|5.0|i bought it as present for a friend of mine. The merchandise came in excellent condition. Thank you very much..
1594203334|5.0|Well written and well researched!  Easy read with lots of good information which then led me to buy Dr. Cohen's book (he is a part of this one) which we really, really like.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br />We followed the \\"instructions\\" or advice in this book about Le Pause, getting the baby to sleep or \\"do her nights\\" and are now working on the feeding schedule/piece.<br />As far as sleep goes: by the time our child was 6 weeks old she was a GREAT sleeper (at least 4 to 5 hour chunks at a time) and at 4 and 1/2 months old would only wake up once a night for a feeding. She is now 7 months old and sleeps straight through the night (11 hours each night). She does a great job about putting herself back to sleep if she wakes up in the middle of night unless she's in distress, like a really bad burp.<br />Feeding: likes to try everything, isn't picky about what she eats and does a good job of sitting through a two course meal without getting antsy, we'll push for a 3 course meal when she's a little older.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|One reviewer mentioned earlier that one keeps reading this book, thinking it will get better after the first few pages.  Sadly, it doesn't.  Unbelievable plot, unlikeable, unreal characters.  The writing is...is...evocative? tortured? in need of editing?  All of the above?  First, the plot.  The seemingly middle class parents decide to rob a bank to solve a fiscal problem.  The children (15 year old twins)  are left alone, and child protective services never appear....  One of the  twins runs away, the other (the protagonist) ends up in a Canadian town with a hunting guide who wears his hair in a pony tail with a rhinestone clip, and more than occasionally, wears a touch of pink lipstick.  The protagonist  is supposedly under the protection of a man who is never fully described, but who ultimately kills two more men because they may recognize him from a crime committed years ago.  The characters are shells--we aren't even told, for the most part, what they look like, other than a fragment here and there that's usually repeated and repeated--the protagonists mother has very curly hair, that's clear, and the hunting guide has a predilection for make-up.  Not recommended.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|This is an old movie but my kids 11, 12 and 17 all loved it and were singing the songs. Good family movie and you don't have to worry about the occassional profanity that many of todays movies contain.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Game is fun and has some great features however the ads irritate me. Each new game presents a new ad which you must get rid of before continuing.
B0018RA6DK|5.0|Husband loved the movie<br />Also bought another 48 hours and recommends this item.  Loved the another 48 hours more.  enjoy
B000SGRONM|5.0|David Sedaris always comes through. I read and love all of his books. His humor is dry and clever. Looking forward to a new book; soon I hope.
B001CDZZI6|3.0|This item was very helpful but it could be dangerous for those that think they are someone they are not.  It will however show you what strengths you do posses and I suggest seeing someone that can help you talk about your feelings after you use this product.  They may help you become the person you want to be or the person you already are.  Remember every one is worth something and they just have to realize their gifts and share them with the world.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|My wife downloaded this game for her Kindle Fire HD on our account. Since then she just sits on the couch trying to get a new high score. The laundry is piling up, the children haven't been fed for days, and I'm reduced to watching old Sports Illustrated Swimsuit videos for satisfaction. Shes apparently gotten level 37 done in only 18 moves, whatever that means.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The third book made the second one worth reading.  This isn't going down as great American fiction but is a very readable book.  I faltered during the second in the trilogy but glad I made it to the end.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great puzzle game!  It really works your problem solving skills. I have very much enjoyed playing through the levels of difficulty!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a good book. Sounded kind of familiar to another book I read before. They had similar story lines. Overall the book was great. I would recommend it to my friends.
0307730697|5.0|When Navy SEAL Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan--but he was ready: In a letter to his children, not meant to be seen unless the worst happened, he wrote, \\"I'm not afraid of anything that might happen to me on this earth, because I know no matter what, nothing can take my spirit from me.\\"<br /><br />Long before Adam Brown became a member of the elite SEAL Team SIX--the counterterrorism unit that took down Osama bin Laden--he was a fun-loving country boy from Hot Springs, Arkansas, whose greatest goal had been to wear his high school's football jersey. An undersized daredevil, prone to jumping off roofs into trees and off bridges into lakes, Adam was a kid who broke his own bones but would never break a<br />promise to his parents.<br /><br />But after high school, Adam fell in with the wrong crowd, and his family watched as his appetite for risk dragged him into a downward spiral that eventually landed him in jail. Battling his inner demons on a last-chance road to redemption, Adam had one goal: to become the best of the best--a U.S. Navy SEAL.<br /><br />An absorbing chronicle of heroism and humanity, Fearless presents an indelible portrait of a highly trained warrior who would enter a village with weapons in hand to hunt terrorists, only to come back the next day with an armload of shoes and meals for local children. It is a deeply personal, revealing glimpse inside the SEAL Team SIX brotherhood that also shows how these elite operators live out the rest of their lives, away from danger, as husbands, fathers, and friends.<br /><br />Fearless is the story of a man of extremes, whose courage and determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman. It's about a man who waged a war against his own worst impulses and persevered to reach the top tier of the U.S. military. Always the first to volunteer for the most dangerous assignments, Adam's final act of bravery led tothe ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Adam Brown was a devoted man who was an unlikely hero but a true warrior, described by all who knew him as fearless.<br /><br />My Reviews: This book is an inspiring story of a young man who had struggles in his life but through God's grace lived an extraordinarylife. The book starts telling Adam's story from the beginning of his life. It starts out somewhat slow but the author is giving you the background of a man's life that shows us how God can work through an ordinary person and use them in a tremendous way. As we all know Adam's life ending too soon but not in vain. This is not the usual military book just about war but one of  God's Grace and Mercy at work in an area we might not expect. I recommend this book for everyone to read. God Bless the men and women of the military.<br /><br />\\"I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book. Kept me reading and reading. Could not get enough. A fantastic read and highly recommended. Looking forward to getting started on book two.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|Very disappointed. I really liked the app before they made it a requirement to have all Amazon apps enabled in order to update any of them. I don't want to have Audible enabled and I wont be bullied into having it enabled. So, all of them are disabled now. I guess Google will be my go to provider now.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I think this album is an amazayn second album to Up All Night! They have done such a good job on this new album!

1466401885|5.0|I LOVE this book. Sexy back and forth love story. I think this would make a great film! I have read it many times. It arrived on time and in great condition.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The thing that puts this app in the five star category is that it has a really good widget. Recommend this app to anyone.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This show lasted for 10 seasons! It was a little silly, but I believe that was intentional. Tom Welling will forever be my favorite Superman! He's the perfect choice. The package arrived on time and in good condition.
B009CF7GRY|4.0|After hearing what critics and others had to say, we didn't have high hopes for this movie. I think most of their dislike of the movie is that it isn't an exact remake. Rather it is the same story in a different location, with updated music, etc.<br />The relationship between Ren and Ariel is much more believable when played by Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough than in the orignial. While I found Kevin Bacon to be a believable and likable Ren, I always felt Lori Singer seemed far older than the teenager she was supposed to portray and was thus not believable in the role of Ariel.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This show lasted for 10 seasons! It was a little silly, but I believe that was intentional. Tom Welling will forever be my favorite Superman! He's the perfect choice. The package arrived on time and in good condition.
B008ANFRG6|5.0|Another amazing album by Steve Vai, the second installment in his &#34;Real Illusions&#34; trilogy. If you're a fan of Vai, expecting the unexpected is a given, though the quality stays consistently high with each new effort. A must-have for any fan of Vai or the guitar!
1481278738|5.0|I got this book because I am a total beginner with my new GoPro camera and it really helped me to get started fast. Thanks to the useful tips in this book I am actually really proud of what I can produce now. It is very clearly written and easy to understand, even for a beginner like me. The 'angles' section really inspired me to experiment and I got some very cool shots.<br />I definitely recommend this book!
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|Let me start by saying: I've NEVER written a review about a book. I just had to for this mess because I am truly astounded. For starters, in the beginning, Abby was made to seem like a proper \\"goody-two-shoes\\" girl with the 20 cardigans and pearls, then she is magically a hot and sexy party girl wearing heels and skimpy dresses everywhere? Travis' character changes too much as well. At first he's the campus bad boy; rough, tough and sexy...then he becomes this obnoxious, obsessive, psycho boyfriend that I despised.<br /><br />The entire situation with her dad and the mob literally came out of left field. I can't help but laugh about that. This is horrible for teenage girls to read. His possessiveness with Abby is NOT okay. I truly thought the ended was going to be that he beat her up, so I was shocked. when they ended up married. Actually, I was disgusted.<br /><br />The last fight where Travis says he can't concentrate if she's not in sight because he doesn't know what she's doing?? I was like HELLO! By simply saying \\"I love you\\" four thousand times to someone, doesn't mean you really love them and should go marry them. I was so annoyed with her best friend America as well because she also saw nothing wrong with their screwed up relationship, she encouraged it! Kara, her roommate was the only sane person in this book, telling Abby about her codependent relationship.<br /><br />I am just rambling at this point because I'm so mad! I just finished this book and I'm appalled at the ending. I really thought she was going to end up dead and/or badly beaten because of Travis' excessive violence. Ugh!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Best movie I've bought in a long time, a great story and beauitful back ground . Buy it you will love it....
B006OGMEUI|5.0|Loved this album, especially the title song itself. Although I'm not much for screaming, the awesome music makes up for it. And truthfully, I greatly enjoy listening to the prologue and epilogue speeches. Gives me a wonderful feeling of Epicness.
B005LAII12|1.0|Never let your under age kids watch it. The movie is dissapointing. The plot and language is discusting and cheap....
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|It was okay,not horrible but really a really hard to believe kind of book. Worth reading as the beginning of a series.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Book was recommended to me and meets my expectations.  Excellent detail on the home brewing process. Provides a wealth of information.

B00APUQJLO|5.0|I enjoy \\"mood\\" films like Blade Runner, Solaris and yes, Twilight (the first one, directed by Catherine Hardwicke).  I find Robert Pattinson a mesmerizing actor.  I just enjoy looking at him and watching him work his craft, which fits perfect for this Train of Thought film.  He is able to draw me into the highly intellectual-heartless world of Eric Packer.  It is a well chosen cast of actors that draw me into their character's own diatribe of thought in regards to their world and mine.  I like the strange atmosphere of a futuristic New York City with violent hostile mobs without-a-cause and Eric's bizarre, persistent quest across the violent, dangerous and congested city to get a haircut,unto an equally bizarre end.<br /><br />Not a film for the typical Robert Pattinson fandom that are of the mind \\"he's so HOT right now!!\\"----well, there are he's partial nude scenes.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought one song, the title track and I like it. What more can I say, but She is a great singer?

B0098VYKSA|4.0|Good visual effects. Different then what we know as Snow White growing up! Theron was great in this movie. Pleasantly suprised.
B008G59IKO|3.0|After listening to all three of Green Day's trilogy of Uno Dos and Tre, I'm beginning to recall why artists will record 30 to 40 songs and then whittle them down to the best dozen. Dos is a good album with a fair amount of filler, balanced by some experimental sidelines. They still maintain a snotty attitude and can deliver hooks like mad, just as you can tell from \\"F-Time\\" and \\"Wow That's Load\\" attest. Although once again, the sing along of \\"F-Time\\" is marred by the juvenile quality of the song.<br /><br />What's good is \\"Nightlife,\\" featuring a rap from one Lady Cobra (who gets a song named after here for her efforts) and the melancholy \\"Amy.\\" Or more specifically, Amy Winehouse, whose trial leaves Billie Joe Armstrong to lament \\"will you be my friend?\\" It's a telling story (like \\"Macy's Day Parade\\" from \\"Warning\\") made all the more ironic by Armstrong's trip to rehab. There's still plenty of frantic energy involved, but like I stated previously, what feels like an inordinate number of lesser quality songs. \\"Tre\\" suffers from the same fate. \\"Uno\\" is the clear winner, but you can pick songs from the samples and make your own best of.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The story line was very good.  It kept you interested.  The graphics were great. Some of the mini games were challenging but good.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story was somewhat interesting but I felt the characters never became fully-developed and that some story lines never fully resolved.  It almost seems that she got bored towards the end and just wanted it over.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B007TR1R22|4.0|This is a short movie. And there isn't a big plot. It's pretty straight forward. The thing that makes this movie beautiful is probably the time period. When everything is in that wonderful simple nostalgic era. Tom Hiddleston is an amazing actor. He is so deep and passionate in everything he does. Even though his role in this film is short,you won't forget it. Rachel Weisz also does a splendid job at playing a conflicted woman who is in love and having an affair. You really feel her emotions. Like I said its a short movie. But if you just want something simple to watch, something to escape from the everyday norm then check The Deep Blue Sea out. This is one of those movies that lingers in the back of your mind.
B008NEMPTO|5.0|movie works great and arrived on time it looks great in 3d i use this movie alot special features  are great too.
B002ZG99QS|3.0|Like I said it's visually cool. The main reason and I think the best reason why I watched this was for Michael Sheen. If you like eccentric characters then watch this for Michael Sheen playing Zeus. He was brilliant.

0553801473|2.0|George R. R. Martin was once described as the American Tolkien. He was headed that direction until Books 4 and 5, where he turned to Robert Jordan for inspiration. Tolkien knew how to finish an epic and leave millions of adoring fans long after his death. Jordan knows how to draw out a story until his fans dwindle into nothing -- squeezing maximum profit from them for as long as possible. I could sum up the exciting plot developments of this book in a couple of sentences. Instead of plot, this book develops characters until you want to pull your hair out. I know more than I ever wanted to know about them. Save yourself the frustration, read a synopsis, and wait for Martin to write something worth reading -- like he used to.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The lifeboat adventure would not mean much to me without his earlier life India (that I had some trouble getting through).I'm glad I kept at it.

B004DM0UII|4.0|This is another solid internet radio app with a gorgeous interface. My favorite radio apps are iHeart and Tunein for local radio. Xiialive has a wider variety of radio stations not found on either iHeart or Tunein. I searched for some of my favorite local stations I use in the other 2 apps and they are not available in xiialive.<br /><br />So instead of using xiialive to replace the other 2 which is what I had hoped it looks like it will compliment the other two apps.<br /><br />UPDATE: This is the FASTEST radio internet app I have used. I don't know how the devs did it but unlike the other internet radio apps you usually have to deal with the connection first then the buffering of the audio. With xiialive I have NOT encountered any buffering or connection issues. Playback is nearly instantaneous. I tried it from a range of radio stations from around the world including different genres and as soon as I selected the station the audio appeared.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|I am still getting use to my Kindle Fire tablet.  There are a number of things I have to explore and get use to.
B004I744AS|4.0|I have a hardcopy dictionary, I got it at yard sale in1983, the copyright says it was printed in 1977. It was definitely time to get a newer edition. I have my old book and I'll keep it.  It's 13 by 17 inches and weighs 17 pounds, it's also a top of the line doorstop. The kindle edition has all the words and phrases that weren't around in 1977. Seriously -get the new dictionary you'll need it some polnt, and better to have it and not need it, etc.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am still getting use to using my Kindle Fire Tablet.  This product will come in handy for all of my programs.

B0076DELIG|5.0|The great thing about michael connelly is that so far he never disappoints.  The reader cares about his protagonist and main characters, and best of all, connelly always ties up any loose ends and leaves the reader satisfied that the plot has been resolved.  No hurried endings here.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This movie was awesome. It was a great cap to the series and I liked the concept. I would recommend this movie to anyone that grew up with MIB.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Purchased for my adult son who watches the series.  He was quite pleased with it and has rewatched the first season.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|The movie was very true to the book. My only was problem was it continually downloaded throughout the movie and always seemed to stop at the best parts.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love a book that transports you to another place as soon as you begin reading, and Martin does just that with this series.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|This may be the worst movie ever made, or at least the worst I've ever seen. I think it is truly sick to take a child's toy and turn it into a semi-pornographic movie.  Many stupid parents would let their kids watch without ever even checking this out just because it is about a teddy bear.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Shipment was fast as well as accurate to the product description. I love the CD and would recommend to friends.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I think the book was ok. I didn't really enjoy it that much I also didn't like the author that much.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|hats this game my brother got mad when he was playing the game a froze my kindle it took 34HOURS to Fisk it aaas
B008FPZQRO|3.0|OK, let me start by saying that ELP's \\"Tarkus\\" album was the very first album I ever asked for as a kid, and I played this thing to death on vinyl. Interestingly enough I never snagged it on CD, until I saw the 2012 Deluxe Edition 3 CD set. Ordered it from Amazon and threw it in my CD player. Listened to the first disc, which is the original 1971 album, it is every bit as great as I remembered it. Was surprised I remember all the lyrics.<br /><br />Now the second disc is called \\"The Alternate Tarkus\\". I was definitely interested in hearing this...thinking \\"alternate\\" would mean perhaps an early version or alternate takes from the original album. So on the way home from work yesterday I gave the second disc a listen. What you have here is a SLIGHTLY different mix of the entire album plus 3 unreleased tracks, and when I say SLIGHTLY I do mean SLIGHTLY. Yes there are a few differences here and there in this remix but honestly (in my own humble opinion) this is NOT REALLY NEEDED! I don't need to hear a few extra seconds of talk before \\"Jeremy Bender\\" or a few extra seconds of gibberish at the end of \\"Are you Ready Eddie?\\" A couple of the tracks hardly sounded different at all from the original mixes! The two outtakes and 1 alternate version are a nice touch, but really the whole \\"alternate Tarkus\\" did not really have to be included. Why do I say this? Simply because a lot of fans/collectors who buy these deluxe editions look for more...as in more outtakes, real \\"alternate\\" versions, etc...not just a \\"new 2012 alternate mix\\" which is not that different from the original. Why couldn't Razor & Tie have included something more, perhaps a live version of \\"Tarkus\\" from this tour? (Yes I know there is a live version on \\"Welcome Back my Friends...\\" but that is taken from a different tour). I personally think a deeper look into the vaults may have yielded something than most of what's offered on this disc. And if there's not, then a single CD release of this with the extra tracks added on would have suited me just fine. I just can't help but feeling that the label really wanted to do a 3 disc set of this no matter what...or what was on it.<br /><br />The third disc is the DVD audio 5.1 mix of both mixes.<br /><br />So yeah, a 5 star album only gets 3 stars from me.<br /><br />Oh and I must point out, before I gave this a listen I was considering buying ELP's \\"deluxe edition\\" of the first album, but after hearing this and seeing how they have the same \\"alternate 2012 mix\\" thing on that album as well I am seriously considering not buying it.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|This book was so well thought through with many facts and places that I recognized.  The scenic and action descriptions were well thought out and presented in a smooth and flowing read.  The ending chapters were very cleverly done.  I am sure the editors cut out too much.  They always seem to.  I had a hard time putting the book aside (as I am supposed to be working) and was just hoping it could have been much more to it.<br />Don't stop with these great books.
0062200399|1.0|this is the same title , but thats where the simmilarities end. This book is very small . also there is very very small amount of art inside. Just a small amount above evry few pages .more in the way of decorations. So if you are buying hoping to see Vess art ... . You wont , much.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|What a great book.  The content is well thought out and the story line is smooth and easy to read tne follow.  Well done.  I could not put it down and was hoping for more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book...  In some ways it seems unrealistically brutal, but as I consider real-world cruelty, I think this is no worse.  And, in the end, there is not a happily-ever-after, but neither is there despair.  There is a hard-won hope... a sense that even given the horrific losses of life and innocence, there is the potential for joy.<br /><br />Me?  I think that is real.  And it is a helpful perspective in a world that can be hard.

B000002G30|5.0|Space rock worthy of Hawkwind!!! If you don't know Hawkwind Google it! These guys know how to rock on the edge of a knife, there are no bad cuts, all are gutsy and food for the mind, if you like tripy rock check these guys out!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie is just filled with laughter. As you all know it has &#34;That Blonde Chick&#34; in it which just makes the movie. Great singing and choice of songs, just wish the soundtrack had more of them in there vs the few they chose.
B00006JDVV|5.0|If you love sci-fi and dragons, this is for you! Well written, well acted, and visually mesmerizing. There was a great deal of passion that went into the production of this film. I enjoyed it immensely!
B0091VGAXK|5.0|All of the actors did phenomenally ( even Tom Cruise! ) Their singing was top notch ( yes it was them ) and the acting was great. Real blast from the past.
034580404X|5.0|Wonderful series I love Christain and Ana I have read the series Three times and each time I read them I loved them even more.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Very interesting read.  Sometime it is difficult to follow the book as it jumps from the present to the past without bridging the gaps.
B00006FDCD|4.0|It is a classic.  Easily one of Stephen King's best movies and novels.  The only reason I give it four instead of fie stars is the ending.  I won't ruin it for you but I think its a little silly for a movie of this magnitude.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|just a little boring.  but kind of like the real fgame in truck stops!!  wish you got extra coins faster.
B009EANE3M|4.0|I love the sound of The Script.  This is their first album I've owned and I'll buy more for sure.

0316286850|3.0|I was looking for a make-up book with steps on how to achieve different looks. I think that was the goal of the book, but in the modern world of youtube, where you can actually watch someone apply make-up step-by-step, this book fell short. Granted, no book will live up to a video, but the description of each make-up look was almost the same. They could have used different pictures for each step at least or given a better description of how to apply them. Having said that, the looks displayed in the book were really inspiring, and the makeovers were dramatic. This book is good for inspiration only.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Not that it is important to make sense of this, but I cannot ignore the fact that the villains in this Cartoon of a human drama had no motivation do do any of the evil they performed. What is equally stultifying is that they choose to do all their bad deeds to just This City called Gotham with no apparent connection to it. What becomes even more bizarre is how the rest of the world simply ignores what is happening which clearly goes on more days, weeks, maybe even months.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I found this entertaining. I am a retired Speech Pathologist . . studied back in early &#34;Sixties&#34; and I remember how the field changed over the years.  The &#34;caring &#34; teacher seemed to be a good friend to the student no matter what the status or problem.<br />Much different than the medical approach I see now.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I am a believer in &#34;heaven&#34; so this was not a shocking read for me.  What I liked most is that God chose this man who studies the brain, and who was not a believer to experience a small piece of what the afterlife looks like.  It might look different to all of us, who knows...still alive here! But I believe his story and think its awesome he was able to share it.  Its exciting. Its good news.  Beats the alternative of no after life and no answers to what life is really about.  I recommend it.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed playing with this.  I got better and better as I went along with the different song, skills etc.  I never was &#34;really great&#34; but I enjoyed myself.  I did however drive my daughter crazy.
B00571F26Y|3.0|Nothing new in this book except a history lesson on wheat.  There is good information about wheat allergies but if you have done a low carb diet before you won't find any new information.  It is the same list of foods you should and should not eat.  Maybe you will get some new recipes but that is it.

I just hope that a second book comes out because I want to keep reading this story!  I am a very hard-to-please reader because I lose interest easily, but this was seriously one of my favorites!  You won't regret choosing this book.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|google has always been my favorite search board.  If I don't key exactly what I am looking for, it gives me choices to choose from.  I would highly recommend this this search board to anyone.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Interesting read... wasn't expecting to see the arena again! The movie should be exciting. :) The only issue I had was with the rushed pace of the ending... but I'd recommend the series enthusiastically for young or old readers. Can't wait to conclude!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Coming off of the fantastic Bourne trilogy with Matt Damon I was a little skeptical when I heard that Damon wasn't going to be in this latest entry, but Jeremy Renner did a fantastic job. Having enjoyed the original trilogy, I was excited when I first heard of Legacy. I never read the books so I was fortunate enough to not have them get in the way of my enjoyment. However I do know that the movies don't really follow the books at all.<br /><br />The film takes place during the time of The Bourne Ultimatum. Namely, we start at the point when Simon Ross gets shot at Waterloo Station. Now I was a little taken back because I kind of thought this would be it's own separate story, which it is in it's own right, but Bourne is mentioned a handful of times. Although, now that I think about it, I think I enjoyed the film more because they found a way to tie these two stories together.<br /><br />One of the main issues people had with the original trilogy was the shaky camera during the fight sequences and even during some of the dialogue-heavy scenes. Thankfully that has been improved drastically. During some of the action scenes it does get a little crazy, but it's a big improvement from before. However, compared to the the original trilogy, the action scenes weren't as frequent. The first half was trying to shape the story and get you used to the characters, while the second half really picks up the pace. Which brings me to my next point.<br /><br />Even though I really enjoyed the film I felt the story was a little weak at times and they didn't always do a great job of explaining why something happened. Which left some scenes feeling kind of pointless. Eric Byer (Edward Norton) seems to be the main antagonist, but they do very little to explain his character or even his job. From the viewers point of view he wants to kill all the participants of Treadstone, but we're left ignorant as to why. At least that's how Ifelt after watching it.<br /><br />Even though I did have some small gripes with the story my main problem was that the ending, for me, was a little anticlimactic. I wasn't expecting the film to end after the chase scene and I kind of felt like it just ended abruptly. It did leave possibilities for another film though, which is always nice. I must say that the entire cast did a fantastic job. As I already said Jeremy Renner was amazing and Edward Norton and Rachel Weisz both gave great performances as well.<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - Overall this really is a solid film. It may not have been as strong as the earlier entries, but it was good in its own right. Aaron Cross was an interesting and compelling character and I look forward to seeing more of him in future Bourne films.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This series is such a wild ride!  Read it, and you will be lost in the world of Hunger Games.
B005LAII8A|5.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />There are so many words I can use to describe Looper: fantastic, compelling, exhilarating  exciting, phenomenal. It's hard to chose only one. When you get two of my favorite actors (Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) in one movie I have every right to assume something will go wrong, but they pulled it off. It's been a while since we've seen such an original story in the action genre, but that's what makes Looper all the more special.<br /><br />For the most part Looper is a pretty straightforward scifi action flick, if you pay attention. The writer's did a fantastic job at making sure everything was explained before, or after, something happened that way the audience didn't get confused. However, there was a small section towards the middle that made me kind of put the pieces together real quick, but it only took an instant to get up to speed.<br /><br />I'm sure many have already explained the plot, but I'll give a brief summary. In short Joe Simmons of 2044 (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Looper. In the future time travel was invented and made illegal, but that doesn't stop the major crime mobs from getting rid of people when they need to. That's where Joe comes in. For each assignment he has to be in the fields on the outskirts of the city by a specific time. Once someone pops up from the future he shoots them.<br /><br />Now Joe isn't the only Looper, there's dozens of them. In the future the \\"Rainmaker\\" is trying to eliminate all ties to this organization ever existing and, eventually, every Looper will get sent their future self. Once they kill them they get some bonus money and then proceed to live their life for the next 30 years until they get sent back in time to get killed. If they let them get away? Well let's just say we don't want that happening. That's were Joe Simmons of 2074 (Bruce Willis) comes in. He's out for revenge and he wants to stop the Rainmaker before he has a chance to grow intothe crime boss that he is in the future. The only problem is that in 2044 the Rainmaker is a kid and there's three children that were born on the same day in the same hospital as him.<br /><br />Now, for me, one of the main themes in this film was testing one's morality. What would you do to get exactly what you want? Is there a limit to what you would do for happiness? Could you kill a kid just to get the perfect future? This is something the viewer constantly sees Old Joe struggle with throughout the movie and it's really quite moving. It makes you step back for a moment and think what would you do if you were in that situation?<br /><br />If I haven't made it clear already I thought the story was fantastic. It was well paced and full of rich and enjoyable characters. There were a few minor characters  like Kid Blue that felt pretty unimportant to me, but overall these characters are fantastic. Then you have the fantastic writing that kept you on the edge of your seat the entire time. When I say that it isn't an exaggeration. I've seen a lot of movies that have suffered from scenes that seem to drag on, but Looper doesn't have that problem.<br /><br />Lastly, the acting in this movie is phenomenal. We all know Bruce Willis can act his ass off when he gets the proper script and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is quickly putting himself in that same category. These two men are a joy to watch solo, but put them in a film together and they completely dominate. It was insane. Match that with the strong supporting cast of Emily Blunt, Jeff Daniels, Paul Dano, and Pierce Gagnon and you have an amazing, well rounded, cast.<br /><br />Overall Score: 9.5/10 - How I wish I would've seen this when it was in the theaters. I loved it sitting on my living room couch, but it had to have been 1000x better in the cinema. Either way Looper is fantastic. When a movie is filled with an amazing story, a great cast, and great acting it's hard not to recommend. This is definitely a film you shouldcheck out.

B00A9X9ORI|2.0|The movie didn't even make sense if you really want to dig into the \\"plot\\". It was quite silly. Overall, the acting and graphics were the only thing keeping this film alive.
B004SRNH10|3.0|This product doesn't actually do anything at the user level, but it's required by many other programs making it a necessary evil with updates that are a bit too frequent for something you can't even see direct use from.
