0321857895|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo16IBEI0JKN23S]]The Sketchnote handbook is a lovely and useful book. Buy it if you want to take poweful notes and have fun doing so. Rohde shows us how to create powerful, personal notes, infused with feeling, and exploding with ideas visualized. I am a professional visual notetaker and design educator, and I am always looking for fresh approaches to this powerful medium. Mike delivers a fun and useful book in that both professionals and novices will appreciate. Mike shows why Sketchnotes work and he shows a variety of approaches to creating them, showcasing sketchnoters from from around the world to underline his points. The book is an easy read, designed to skim or dive deep. Rohde emphasizes that sketchnoting is about capturing ideas, not about showing off virtuoso art chops, and gives useful tips on structure, quick and easy drawing, and penmanship and lettering. Rohde's tone is encouraging as he urges you to start slowly and build on success. Even adding one little drawing to your notes will help you connect to the ideas in a presentation long after its over. If I were to make one suggestion for a modification in a future edition, I'd like Mike to find some clearer examples of one of the structures he describes, the radial structure. The examples he shows, which are nice works in and of themselves, do not show that radial structure it as clearly as I would like (check out Brandy Agerbeck's \\"Graphic Facilitator's Guide\\" for some nice examples of radial structure). This in no way takes away from the overall awesomeness of the Sketchnote handbook. A stellar resource worthy of 5 big, glistening stars! Go add it to your library and change the way you take notes.
0345803485|1.0|I read this book only because I was so sick and tired of being the only person that didn't read it.  I'm sorry I did.  It was terrible, repitive and the characters just plan sucked.  Ana is a weakling to fall for such a psychopath and Christian's formal talk annoyed me so bad I had to skip paragraphs to get away from it.  I felt like I was reading the same sex scene over and over again.  Don't waste your time reading this trash.
1594488843|5.0|I've read every book by Mr. Pink. I follow him on Twitter and pre-order his upcoming book. So now you know: I'm a kind of fanatic. But this particular book is the most splendid collection of provocative ideas and thoughts on motivation you've ever read. A must-read for anyone managing people, a company or just curious on what actually motivates people. A great book!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is an instant trip back to relive the incredible WICKED experience. If you haven't seen it yet, listen and get a taste of this fabulous play. The music is great. I especially love The Wizard and I, hearing the emotion evoked for a young girl who realizes for the first time that she is special, that she matters. Defying Gravity and For Good are so stirring. The evolutions of I'm Not That Girl voice the pain of unrequited love. What is This Feeling and Popular are just ...well..FUN! Enjoy it ..... Over and over again!
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle does a great job. The mysteries will leave you hanging. Anyone who likes mysteries or Sherlock Holmes will love this book!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Great movie. Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep are great together. Some humor mixed in with some drama. Good date movie. Hopefully they will makw more movies together.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great movie. It finishes up what was started in the first two movies in good fashion. We even get a brief appearance by Scarecrow as he holds trials in the criminal-over-run Gotham while Batman is out of the picture...My only complaints:<br />1) should have shot it in 3D, this was a great opportunity and it's a shame it was missed. 2) Talia was not like she was in the comics that I have read. 3) I think we should have seen a little bit more of \\"Robin\\" as he discovers the Bat Cave... 4) There have been no definite plans announced for a sequel, however, I think there are important clues in the film that there COULD be one...the Bat Signal has been repaired; Robin has quit the police force, fed up with the restrictions imposed by the \\"law\\", and found the Bat Cave; Its very possible to foresee a sequel or spin off with Robin becoming the \\"new\\" Batman, or perhaps Nightwing...and with his connection with orphans and the orphanage now nearby, perhaps a sidekick could end up helping him fight crime. Given, its pretty obvious they would need training to effectively operate, perhaps Bruce would return to mentor him, or perhaps he would find someone else capable of training him...all in all, a great movie, and I would definitely recommend this to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoyed this one.  Tricky little pipe flows every now and then keep you thinking. Great for pattern recognition.  minimum wordcount
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I just couldn't believe it Angry Birds and Star Wars what a combo a match made in a galaxy far away in a time long ago. Awesome.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great little Sim game.  The entire Facebook thing sUx0rz though.  Seriously if I could opt out of the entire Facebbok crap I'd give this game 5 stars.  The pay 2 play model doesn't annoy me near as much.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher explodes in the first episode of Lee Child's stellar series. Reacher 101 is a crash course in all that makes him one of the most amazing heros of contemporary fiction.

B005G5PPGS|5.0|Interesting. Good book by Michael Lewis. Interesting sabermetrics. l hope Lewis writes more books about sports like this. READ IT!
0446547646|3.0|I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan. I own all his books, including the Best of Me. When I finished the book I stared at the last page thinking, \\"Really? That's how you're going to end such a captivating and twisted love story?\\" Not his best. Now, Safe Haven on the other hand, is not one of his typical sappy love stories; I LOVED it, I highly recommend Safe Haven over the Best of Me.

B005LAII1C|1.0|Although I've watched South Park and Family Guy, some of the vulgar content in this movie made me uncomfortable. This movie just had too much profanity and obscenity for my taste. Some jokes were overused and funny at first, got old very fast. As a result, the movie dragged, became boring and a waste of time. I didn't find Ted likable at all. Plus, Seth MacFarlane didn't attempt to give him a voice different from Peter in Family Guy so every time Ted spoke I imagined Peter from Family Guy. That's just lazy on Seth MacFarlane's part. And I find Peter one of the least likable characters on Family Guy which may have played a huge part in my disliking of this movie. The plot is not good. In fact, it feels quite juvenile compared to the writing on Family Guy. There is still much was left to be desired in the story. Glad I didn't waste hard earned money on this one.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this site. I have an app for this on my iphone my kindle and my p c. Warning this site is very very addicting.
0393072231|5.0|ABSOLUTELY COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I HAVE READ NUMEROUS BOOKS ON THE SUBJECT AND THIS WAS MAYBE THE BEST. ALSO THE FACTS I KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ARE ACCURATE IN THIS BOOK.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual I really liked this book. I think I have read all his books and I don't want to stop reading this one either. I would reccomend it to others. I'm looking forward to his next book.
159420411X|5.0|IT IS VERY INFORMATIVE AND HONEST AND INTERESTING. I LIKE AN AUTHOR WHO LOOKS AT BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN AND JUST DOESN'T LOOK AT ONE SIDE OF AN ARGUMENT. PLUS HE EXPLAINS HOW TO DO IT RIGHT AND HOW IT IS DONE WRONG.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is heart touching and action packed perfect way to finish the series by far the best series of books I've read
1451696205|5.0|I loved this book. I read it as a teen growing up and was excited to hear it was becoming a movie. Excited to see it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have loved this book since I first read it in 7th grade.  Even though I knew the outcome of every situation, Card`s thrilling writing style and skillful manipulation of relationships between characters kept my attention until the very end and still brought a tear to my eye when the story resolves.  I highly recommend this to anyone look looking for character depth and development wrapped inside a blanket of action and excitement.<br />  -Happy reading!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This book is a quick, easy, and fun read that takes place in a alternative but plausible near future world.<br /><br />The pace of the story is very quick (sometimes though to its detriment such as the last quarter of the book which moves a bit too quickly). The characters are not all equally developed but you get a good idea about and feeling for the most important characters.<br /><br />This author of this book seems to be a little confused as to who his audience is. The book's writing style is definitely directed at young adults as there is not a whole lot of subtlety or attention to depth and description as much as there is to action and plot. This being said, the book revels in a fantastic world full of nostalgia for and references to movies, games, and pop culture of the 80's. It is for this reason I found it confusing as to who the author thought would be his primary audience. It is written a bit too simplistically for adults but only adults will fully understand the references in this book and experience the nostalgia that the references evoke. I can say though that I was ultimately able to look past the simplistic writing because I did find the world that the author created to be that much fun.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to those who grew up in the 80's and who want an airplane book (a book that is short and is entertaining without needing too much thought) or to young adults that love video games and an interest in the 80's.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is so fun I love it if you like games that you can build things and have fun well this game is awesome I love it but it kinda sucks cause of the memory it takes but still get it.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|I am a huge fan of Sufjan Stevens and so it was a bit strange to me how disappointed I was when I first listened to this album. I could not make heads or tails of it as it seemed kind of boring and too reliant on electronic sound effects. This album has a 20+ minute song on it. That is a hard sell on its own.<br /><br />This being said, once I listened to the album maybe five or ten times I realized that the more I listened to it the more I enjoyed it. I now have listened to this album enough times that I love it and I am surprised that it still continues to sound better and better to me with each listen. I now wish that 20 minute song was an hour.<br /><br />Don't dismiss this album if you are a Stevens fan, even if you think the 30 second sound previews on Amazon do not intrigue you.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Anyone who enjoys reading should read this story. I'm not a reviewer. I'm not a writer. I'm a reader recomending a story that moved me so whatever your age add it to your collection.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Seminal rock album.  Led Zep defined the heavy metal genre and this is some of their finest work. Get it.
0547884591|3.0|I thought this was ok.  I really preferred the 4Hour work week since it required some logical thoughts and what to do for automation.  This book is more or less of his experience of using the certain products to cook his best dishes.  Although I didn't try out any of the recipes however, the dishes does appear appetizing.  If you are really into \\"COOKING\\" and using the best product to support the necessary culinary skills, then I would go for it.  Otherwise, it's not anything special.
B00064WSNW|5.0|This album has some great tunes on it - some of this stands up very well decades later and could even pass as modern &#34;electronic&#34; music. Matte Kudesai is one of the most beautiful songs.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|graphics were good with an interesting storyline. was a little too much back and forth than I like. this was longer than some of g5's recent games but seemed like a mix and copy of the newer alawar games.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|Product was as described and arrived in good condition. Would be 5 stars if was real leather.<br />Pleased with this purchase. Recommend with the Plantronics Voyager Pro.
B0085P2Z6E|2.0|more hog than puzzles. the few puzzles that are there are easy enough for a 7-8yr old to play.  there are alot of bugs that still need fixing.  on one game there wss a mouse on the list but when I could find NO mouse at all in the scene I clicked the hint and it showed a piece of paper with stones on top of it.<br /><br />the game is timed but there is the option to turn it off. I highly recommend this asevery time you touch the screen it counts as you trying to find an object on the list.. so if you choose to zoom the scene you are penalized for that and as you move the screen about.  there were far too many times that the hint button wouldn't actually show me anything.  also there were a lot of times where the game wouldn't register my taps. I like the point-click/hog/puzzle adventure games but I only have one nevosoft games of this type. now I remember why.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This is a very gooed product and works great on servicing my Kindle. I would purchase another if I should ever need to.

B005KELQEU|5.0|I wanted a case that would protect my kindle (I have small kids) and this does the trick. You remove the Kindle completely in order to read so if you are looking for the kind that makes the Kindle feel like a book this is not for you

6305910189|5.0|I bought this DVD as a companion for the DVD collection that included the original Star Trek television episode called &#34;Space Seed.&#34;  &#34;Star Trek II&#34; is the sequel to &#34;Space Seed.&#34; Watch the two together -- &#34;Space Seed&#34; first, then &#34;Star Trek II,&#34; and enjoy almost 3 hours of William Shatner and Ricardo Montalban over-acting and generally having a great time together.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Compared to his other works, this seemed lazy.  He falls back on sarcasm and wit rather than developing his characters with a little more depth.  Not bad, but he has done better.
B003Y3IKMA|5.0|it's a good shoe for summer and comfortable . Size is okay for my friend and she like its color.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|This was a Great 3d movie. One of those movie I think I'll only watch 2 or 3 times but hey... the 3D was nice for only 14$!!!
B003FNWR6Y|5.0|Everything was packaged neatly and arrived promptly! I'm very satisfied with this purchase!
1419705849|5.0|I bought this book The Third Wheel for my daughter who has all of them in the collection. This is the 7th book in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series.  These are great books to get and keep your kids interested in reading for quite a while.  This book was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner with in the time frame that Amazon estimated it would.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|For the price, this CPU can't be beat (maybe it can if you have some overclocking experience, but ain't nobody got time for that!). This chip runs fast and cool when used with an aftermarket heat sink. I haven't used the heat sink provided, so I can't speak to it's performance. Basically, this CPU has handled everything I've been able to throw at it without getting more than 10 degrees over ambient temp. in an air-cooled PC, so I am incredibly happy with it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I like this game, however I find that it sometimes freezes up - takes your points away from you when it is not your fault.  Takes very long to load.
B000GL1BHO|5.0|Bought this for my grandson for Christmas,he is going to love this.It look's so real.Made really good also I might buy more!!!
B00129H7VS|4.0|It came in a reasonable time and the product works just fine, but the blu-ray box was scratched up and dented a little so I was not exactly please with it.
B004JQN4WM|5.0|Love the way they look.So real it's scarey. the best I have ever seen and I looked a lot before I bought!!!!!!
0143036742|5.0|I am a choosy reader, which makes it all the more special to find a book I enjoy as much as I enjoyed \\"A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian.\\"  I was laughing so hard that my family chased me away to finish it.  I love the language mash-up insults, lovable old father, and little peeks into another culture's history.  It's quirky humor and silly situations require suspension of disbelief, but perfect for those liking zany, creative, and funny books.
141659521X|5.0|I began reading the Mitch Rapp novels over two years ago.  It wasn't until I started reading them in order that I became a fanatic as in intense fan.  Mitch Rapp is someone I wish existed.  Unfortunately, he doesn't.<br /><br />The Last Man is, in my opinion, the best of the Mitch Rapp novels.  Why?  Because it was totally unexpected as to who and what was going on.  I cheated and looked in the back to see if the dog dies.  Don't do it.  The novel is a 500 mph ride and you don't want to spoil the surprises.<br /><br />Really good and, in my opinion, too short.  BUT I get the feeling that we have not really \\"finished\\" this story.  Because there are too many dangling plot lines.  No biggies, the immediate story is wrapped up, but there are others that were uncovered.<br /><br />I had to make myself stop reading last evening as it was 1 AM and I had to get up the next morning.  Otherwise I would have finished it the day after I started it.<br /><br />I cannot wait for the next in the series.<br /><br />BTW, when I picture Rapp, I see the author, not the way the author describes him.
0385535147|4.0|Gresham crafts the most entertaining sorbets in the business (I refer to books as elements of meals, and after heavy entrees, enjoy sorbets to cleanse the palate). His knowledge of legalese is only the starting point in this latest offering, with more twists and turns than usual.  At the end, he caveats that it is a total work of fiction and that no research was necessary since he made everything up.  That made me laugh out loud since at one point in the novel I felt it was just too out in left field, but with that final disclaimer, Gresham is just telling the reader, it's a story.  Enjoy it.
1584282584|5.0|The most interesting position on the book market regarding flash techniques. A must have book for all wedding photographers. I also  recomend another phenomenal book this author:  \\"Off-Camera Flash Techniques for Digital Photographers\\".

B00881VLCE|4.0|I reallylike this game. I like doing puzzles but they take up so much space, I do t get to do them often. With this game I can put together puzzles to my hearts content.
B004GCPJDQ|4.0|I use a Magic Mouse at work (and only there) and my company is a bit stingy about office supplies so finding replacement batteries for my mouse was always a hassle.  I stumbled across the Mobee while looking into rechargeables and I'm very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />The charging base is small and unobtrusive and is just the right size to hold my Magic Mouse while it's charging.  It's very light, so it can move around a bit but since I have it pushed up against a cube wall this isn't an issue.<br /><br />The battery pack itself is, as you would expect, not quite as powerful as a set of alkaline batteries would be.  I was hoping to get a full business week from a charge so I'd only have to remember to charge it on Fridays but I usually fall a day or two short of this goal.  A quick charge at lunch is usually enough to get me through the end of the day and it easily charges completely overnight.<br /><br />A nice bonus because of the way the technology works is that if you do run the battery dry you can take it out and charge it directly on the base and continue to use the mouse with a set of standard batteries.<br /><br />One quibble that I'm not sure I can lay at the Mobee's door is that my MacBook Pro is all over the place on it's estimates of the mouse's power reserves.  It will often report the battery to be near death and then if I power cycle the mouse I'm back at nearly a full charge.<br /><br />All in all, if you use a Magic Mouse, this is a great way to get away from replacing batteries.
B003RNXIBK|3.0|The album is good but not his best.  It's good filler for the ol' playlist.  Buy at your own risk.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I think this app is awesome because it lets me now how long I need to charge it for and were I am at!
B009B50QOU|3.0|Ok album but certainly not thier best.  I would still suggest it for hardcore fans or someone looking for filler in thier playlist.
B0099XX46Q|2.0|Really? Really? Really? The extended edition is only 4 minutes longer? Really? Really? Really? Why pay more for only 4 minutes? Really?
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie!  Very impressed with how well the pulled such a big movie off with some many big stars.  Can't wait for #2!
B001AQIYJC|5.0|I loved the picture.  One disappointment was that the jacket that came with the Dvd indicated it had English Titles and also Closed Captions (which I wanted as I bought the DVD for a hard-of-hearing person).  But, I was not able to activate either choice.  However, rather than return the item, I decided to keep the DVD for myself. jm hirsch
B0098VXN2Y|4.0|Good movie.  Chris Rock is very good as well as Ms. Diaz and Elizabeth Banks.  Good RomCom to chill with.
B003Y5H51K|2.0|I got this for my mom because of the Spanish audio track listed. The DVD has NO Spanish audio track. It does have Spanish subtitles but wish I knew the real specs before buying it. The movie itself is just ok.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|Great album.  The album is hard all the way through.  Some very classic sounds with some new twists.  But it now!

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Although his use of the &#34;F&#34; word was maybe a little too much, I feel it was valid for his situtation. The number of times he considers himself a dead man is so much fun you forget where he is. Mars is described in details that leads you to believe you are on site perusing the Hab and rumaging through the MDV for usuable items. How frightening it is to be in an alien enviroment and be all along with no comunication with the outside world.
B003UGLCIA|5.0|i have always loved this movie its a classic and if you like horror movies you have to buy this one
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I'm an Austen fan but this take off of Pride---- is hilarious.  I've seen it several times and have loved every viewing.
1400049628|1.0|This guide is a basically a hack work of the RPG \\"All Flesh Must Be Eaten\\" which first came out in 1999 and explicitly explores how to survive a zombie apocalypse from every type of weapon imaginable, vehicles, medicines,military training,ect on through to survival types from ninjas to soccer moms!  If you want to learn how to survive then read their corebook and then test your skills in an actual game.  The fiction is even better than Brooks as Eden Studios put out several anthologies that go along with the game.  An as for Brooks claiming in several interviews that no one was writing zombie fiction before he came along, maybe he isn't the expert he thinks he is otherwise he would of heard of Skipp and Spector's \\"Book of the Dead\\" anthologies the latter which came out in 92, or Philip Nutman's \\"WetWork\\" and \\"The Mammoth Book of Zombies\\" which featured author's such as Clive Barker and Lovecraft back in 93 or how about David Moody's \\"Autumn\\" trilogy or Len Barnhart's \\"Reign of the Dead\\" series?  And if he really loved horror comics he would have read \\"Dead World\\" which came out 1987 by Kerr and Griffith and illustrated by Vince Locke.  But by all means keep reading Brook's works if you want to jump on the zombie bandwagon!
B00005MP58|5.0|For me this is the best version of Pride... that I've ever seen.  It's far and away the longest and everything seems perfect.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having worked in high research facilities, it is a pleasure to see yet another scientific mind &#34;come out&#34; with strong evidence (evidence seen every day in research facilities around the world) of creationism and a life beyond this limited existence we call &#34;now&#34;.<br /><br />Bravo Dr. Alexander.<br /><br />Recommend to Agnostics, Atheists, Religious Fanatics and anyone with a question in between.  Enlightening and more information for you to form your own opinion.
B000244FDW|3.0|I have several versions and this is my least liked.  Whether it's the people or the acting or the direction, I could never get into this movie.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Excellent mix of mystery, pyschology, science and survival.  Good interaction and character development.  Look forward to more in the developing tales - Silo 18 and beyond.  Thought provoking.<br /><br />Would recommend for those who like mystery, survivalism or any kind of future cataclysm storytelling.  Appropriate for young (12) old readers with occasional profanity (your kids have probably already heard these words elsewhere).

B008EZVNO0|5.0|The more I listen to all the songs...the more classic Morrison this is.<br />His words are poetry set to melodic, sometimes haunting tunes.<br />A MUST for a Van Morrison fan.
B000BI0WOA|3.0|How they left off &#34;Solid Rock&#34; and &#34;Skate away&#34; is beyond me.  They had all that 2nd disk and &#34;Calling Elvis&#34; is the only saving there!

0316182060|5.0|I've been looking forward to reading Soulless manga volume 2, which is based on the novel Changeless. REM's art is wonderful and she really brings Alexia's world to life. Madame Lefoux is probably my favorite character in this volume; she's sharp and fashionable, but is also a geek at heart. The little background romance between Ivy and Tunstell was also quite amusing, though I think others may find it distracting from the main story.<br /><br />I now look forward to reading Soulless manga volume 3, and hopefully there will be manga adaptations for the last two books in the Parasol Protectorate series as well.

B007IYWY3C|5.0|Great. I love it. It really works. And thank for those people who told me about this. If you want it, don't thinking anymore.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|A nice movie for all the family with a great plot and animation not complicated at all; easy to follow even for a 6 year old!
0553801473|5.0|Have read all the books in series, was going to wait for paperback, but the release kept being pushed back, so had to buy the hardcover.  Glad I did.
B000000OE7|5.0|It's an epitome of Queen and sadly, his last music recorded.  There are other bits that may be produced later but this is epic final.
B00574P9EQ|4.0|This is not as good as the books but it is a fun story, with good characters, and is great for 2nd graders through middle schoolers.

B005LAJ22Q|4.0|I would just put the name Daryl and leave it as that but Amazon wants more words, so here it goes. This is a delightfully fun series, not perfect, but how can anything in a 'zombie world' be perfect? The acting is good, story line fun, although a couple of the characters are whinny which can be irritating but overlooking that .. its just a fun series.  And the best character in my book is Daryl .. Norman was great as a saint and even greater as a zombie killer.  As always Amazon was on time with pkg. and price was right.
B000C25VNM|1.0|I received the wrong book and was told they no longer had the book I wanted and are refunding my cost. So disappointed... I wanted this book for the illustrations. I'm sure I would have loved the correct book.
030745455X|5.0|I read this book last spring soon after I finished reading 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' and loved it. Once again Blomkvist and Salander were just as engaging. A usually untrusting Slander has to rely on Blookvist to help her, and their friendship grows even more. I was wrapped in the story from beginning to end. To me this book was just as good if not better better than the first one. I couldn't wait to read the third.
0871164566|4.0|Great instructions with photos, and ideas for variations.  With this book and a bit of practice, a crafter should be able to wrap almost any kind of pendant
0307454568|3.0|This third book in 'The Millenium' series was a bit of a disappointment for me. I got used to Lisbeth being an action/active figure so having her in a hospital bed for most the story, not able to do much, was a let down. That said, I would recommend 'The Millenium' series to anyone who loves thrillers or murder mystery.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I can't believe I'm just playing Angry Birds but it is a lot of fun!  I can see how people become a little crazy over it, I surely have.
0307454541|5.0|I read this book last spring but I didn't have time to review it then. It is one of the most memorable books I have ever read. I love thrillers and murder mysteries. I really liked the two main characters, Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander. An unlikely pair getting together to solve crimes. I was so absorbed in the plot that I rushed back to the store to get the sequel.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great little bag for a great low price!!!  I've been in the market for a camera backpack and took a chance on this one, which is about 1/5th the price of a bag I was considering.  It's relatively small but holds 2 cameras, 2 speed-lights in their cases, an extra lens.  It has a set of straps for a tripod on the outside, and plenty of pockets for the basic extra's I need when I use 2 cameras to shoot an event.  The inside compartments are adjustable with velcro so you can adapt this to your needs for storage.  For me, too, I prefer a bag that doesn't advertise the camera brand on the outside.  So happy I took a chance on ordering this!!!

B000002JEV|4.0|This 2-disk set, finally released in 1997, is the pick of Zeppelin's BBC radio sessions between 1969 & 1971.<br /><br />Disk 1 takes 14 tracks from March & June '69 sessions, so includes material from the first and second albums plus a number of the blues standards the band performed in the early days to beef-out their stage shows, `Travelling riverside blues', `The girl I love she got long black wavy hair' (both released as singles only in the USA & Canada) and `Somethin' else'.<br /><br />All the material on disk 2 is from an `In Concert' session before a small live audience at the Paris Theatre, London on 1st April 1971. The interesting thing about this concert is that, along with material from the contemporary third album plus a couple of by-then-classic numbers like `Dazed & Confused' and Heartbreaker', the band performed three songs from the fourth album which was not to be released for another 8 months: `Black Dog', `Goin' to California' and `Stairway'. This may be the earliest surviving recording of Zeppelin performing these now-classic numbers live. The original show was introduced to the BBC radio audience by the late John Peel.<br /><br />These classic live sessions on BBC radio were multiply bootlegged, usually recorded from the original radio broadcasts on poor-quality cassette recorders. Finally in 1997 fans could hear the concerts with excellent sound quality, delivered here in a fine package with tasteful monochrome artwork to evoke the period. Whilst the music may lack the polish & production values of their studio recordings with Atlantic Records - which are great in a different way - it has all the raw energy of the band live, and demonstrates what a class act they always were.<br /><br />The smaller venues used for these sessions gives the music a more intimate feel, and because the BBC was a leading-edge professional media/recording company proficient in delivering every type of music to TV and radio audiences with exemplary sound quality, that's basically what you get. Above all, Jimmy Page's persistence and attention to detail has made these sessions available at last, though why it took so many years is nothing short of a scandal. I would rate this package four-and-a-half stars rather than five only because it's just short of the seminal excellence of the 2003-released `How the West was Won', which contains indisputably the best live Zeppelin material ever released.s basically what you get.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Taken from review By Dennis A. Amith (kndy)<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 2:20:1), AVC@22 MBPS. This is where &#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; literally looks amazing. For those who have owned previous versions of the film on DVD, back in 2005, the film went through restoration using a backup negative of the original 70 mm print. At the time, the original 70mm 6-Track print was so damaged, there was no way to even use the original negative at that time and most of us who watched the 40th Anniversary Edition felt that the film looked absolutely beautiful compared to it's earlier 2000 DVD release.<br /><br />With that being said, technology has changed within the last five years since the release of the 40th Anniversary. The damaged original 70 mm print that couldn't be used in the restoration of the film in 2005 can now be used for the film with new hardware and software and is now receiving 8K digital scanning by 20th Century Fox for perfect restoration.<br /><br />No longer is the film hazy, no longer is the film more on the pinkish side. &#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is vibrant. The grass...you can see the various grains of grass, the strands in green, yellow and detail of the mountains over looking Salzburg. I was amazed! Another example, Maria splashing the water before she heads to the von Trapps, you can see the water droplets flying in the air, another one is the von Trapp's uncle and his coat, you can see the wool in his jacket. There is so much detail in this latest version of &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;, it's incredible! I am literally speechless because I own previous versions of this film on video and never before have I seen this much clarity in the film ever!<br /><br />And I find it quite funny for each review I have done for the film, I mention of how the cinematography of William Reynolds was captured perfectly but watching it on Blu-ray, the cinematography... may it be the shots of Maria on the mountain, Maria with the kids on the mountain, the wedding ceremony, etc., I just feel that the cinematography as seen on the 45th Anniversary Edition via the new restoration really captures the beauty of &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; than ever before. Absolutely breathtaking!<br /><br />Once again, the crew who restored this film...I give your crew a standing ovation...what you were able to accomplish with this film on Blu-ray is absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 4.0 Dolby Surround, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital and French 5.1 DTS. Because the film was shot with a 6-track and because they were provided with the audio without the dialogue, for this 2010 edition, they were able to remove all noise but also making sure to utilize a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track and as mentioned, I've owned several versions of this film and I even own the soundtrack to this film.<br /><br />The way this music was handled through the surround channels was amazing. The music and the instruments playing on individual channels was well done. The first thing that came to my mind during sequences of the sisters singing &#34;Maria&#34; to the wedding sequence, the sounds that were utilized through those channels were amazing. Also, they were able to isolate the sound of Salzburg up the hills, the sound of wind, the birds... I was in awe with the lossless soundtrack.<br /><br />I absolutely love the soundtrack for this film and this is the best I have ever heard of it. If you have a 7.1 setup (center speaker, two fronts, two surrounds, two rear surrounds and your subwoofer), you will definitely be impressed with how alive the music comes as it really sounds beautiful via the soundscape in the home. Once again, I was in awe when I heard the music and I'm sure manypeople will be just as impressed by it.<br /><br />Similar to the video restoration, the audio restoration for this 45th anniversary is fantastic! And the crew responsible for the audio restoration for this release should be proud because they did an outstanding job!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />&#34;The Sound of Music: 45th Anniversary Edition&#34; comes with the following special features from the 35th and 40th Anniversary DVD versions of the film but also newer special features that just literally packs this 45th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray release:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />* Your Favorite Things: An Interactive Celebration - A new way to watch &#34;The Sound of Music&#34;.

0374214913|3.0|This was a very difficult book to rate because I never really experienced any of the normal \\"I really love this book\\" type of feelings. I was never on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next, I was never extremely intrigued... This book though definitely had that \\"Je ne sais quoi\\" about it.<br /><br />First of all, the dust jacket on this book glows in the dark, and is all around cool. It sits on the bookshelf in my bedroom soaking up photons when the light is on and when I turn the light off the glow it throws off is surprisingly strong.<br /><br />As for the story - I found the characters likable and strangely realistic seeming despite how unique most of them were, and I think they were what really brought the story to life. The plot itself was mostly interesting, but I found the end kind of flat and unsatisfying.<br /><br />The really unfortunate thing about this book though is not the flat ending, but the fact that the book is going to prematurely age (compared to other books) due to its high tech content. The plot of this book relies heavily on such things as computer databases, fancy Google searches and high tech unheard of Google computer tricks. Some of these plot points sound cool now, but in a few years (considering the speed at which technology develops) those things might be old hat and won't be able to help carry the plot for the reader.<br /><br />So - get it while it's new, you might not like it as much later. But then again, it will probably always look pretty cool sitting on your bookcase.<br /><br />*Review re-posted from Goodreads.com
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game has an entertaining story line and all the tasks that you'll need to complete are relevant to the story. Easy to solve puzzles and easy to stop playing and then pick up later and start back where you left off. Makes for a good game in my book.
1449410243|2.0|Seriously. I have Inman's previous stuff, signed poster...met him twice at New York Comic Con...<br /><br />This book just...I cracked a smile once, and didn't laugh at all. The included poster is still folded up because of how disappointed I was.<br /><br />It's probably my fault, I should have known better. I really dislike his bobcats comics, and from the title I should have surmised it'd be a lot of them. It is in fact a lot of them, so if you feel the same way I do, skip this volume.<br /><br />I ended up giving it to a friend, who is a cat person. I think if you're not a cat-person, you're not a this-book-person either.
0679805273|5.0|This book is about maximizing the potential of your life. The way that Dr. Seuss rhymes words is pure joy to read. I think they say that this book is for young children through adults. It is probably best understood by adults but its message is for everyone, no matter what age.<br /><br />Buy this book, read it, and then do a search for &#34;Oh the places you'll go Burning Man&#34; and watch the marvelous video created by Teddy Saunders.
B0083GOPSG|1.0|Wow this movie was horrible. Made 0 logical sense at all. Just because they can fly/elevate themselves they can all the sudden breathe at 30k feet elevation.... hmmm..<br /><br />Maybe I am just getting older and more annoyed, who knows.<br /><br />horrible movie at best however.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham can always be counted on to keep your attention with his style of writing.  It moves right along
B006O6EOII|3.0|My 5 year old, almost 6 year old daughter loves Monster High dolls. Although, some of them may have \\"questionable\\" at best outfits, they aren't nearly as bad as some of the BRATZ dolls I've seen.<br /><br />Obviously over prices toys, but my daughter loves them and it makes her happy, so in return, I am happy.
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|This book talks about a technology revolution that is behind the current &#34;jobless recovery.&#34;  It explains why our &#34;old&#34; way of life will never return.  Everyone who has a functioning brain must read it, especially those making policy decisions in Washington, DC.  We must innovate, educate and change if we are to survive the Race Against the Machine.
B0073PQ720|5.0|Ok I am heterosexual but Gosling is a pretty dude lol.<br /><br />I loved the movie, very well down for such a low budget. Simple, yet entertaining, cheap yet effective. Great movie.<br /><br />May be on the more gory side for some, so please know there are some BRUTAL scenes.
1463707606|5.0|This is full of beautiful models with excellent diagrams. It includes models created by Meenakshi Mukerji (one inspired by Dennis Walker), Maria Sinayskaya, and Ekaterina Lukasheva - all talented origami designers. I have made Daffodil, Star Flower, and Vortex Dodecahedron (this one was one of the easiest modulars to assemble that I've ever done) so far and they all turned out wonderfully. You can view all of the models via the \\"Search Inside\\" function: all models are pictured on the front and back covers. I highly recommend this book - as well as all of Ms. Mukerji's other books!
B0090EIC3Y|3.0|Semi funny movie, could be offensive to some. Maybe I am just getting older and more annoyed, who knows.<br /><br />Decent movie at best however.
B0067TQQI8|3.0|I received this charger about a week ago and have been using it heavily since, on only two recharges, so I'm pleased with the capacity. The size is also nice as it fits comfortably in a pocket.<br /><br />There are three things about this charger that make me wish I'd investigated longer before purchasing:<br /><br />1. The instructions say that the recharger should be disconnected when the LED panel indicates it has been fully recharged. I'm really surprised to find a device that's about back-up power, but that can't be left plugged in. Given that the last time I recharged it, I plugged it in first thing on arriving at work, and by 5:00pm it was still recharging, on the last of four indicators, it's really inconvenient to have to monitor the charging progress.<br /><br />2. Power indicators are not accurate. I've run this down twice, and both times it showed 3/4 charge for 3-4 hours, then finally down to 1/2 charge...which lasted about 30 minutes before it was completely drained. I've never seen it at 1/4 charged because it seems to go from 1/2 straight to 0.<br /><br />3. The built-in flashlight. I understand that they've made improvements so that it's harder for the flashlight to activate unintentionally, but I've still pulled this device out of my pocket and found that the flashlight was on. (The fix is to make you hold the power button down for a few seconds before the light will come on. I don't like that you then have to hold the button a few more seconds to turn it off.) I personally don't see the need for a flashlight on a recharging device. If my phone is recharged, I can use it as a flashlight.<br /><br />I plan to keep using the Anker, but I'm continuing my search for a replacement.
B008EQIK90|5.0|This movie is awesome and hilarious!<br /><br />I was expecting this to be funny.... and it was! Had my laughing the whole way. Crazy how I could relate to the scene when they arrive into the school parking lot pointing out the cliques and then confused on &#34;what those were&#34;.
B004J4WLB4|2.0|I had a difficult time getting through this book. I finally gave up trying to finish it. Don't waste your money.
B007SNMVH2|3.0|I use to love Underworld, well the first two movies. The 3rd and 4th just were horrible and not entertaining at all to me. Maybe I am just getting older and more annoyed, who knows.<br /><br />Decent movie at best however.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|THE outtakes seen on You-Tube are by far more vivid than the movie - which is not bad, but really not \\"rave-material\\".  For something slightly more intelligent please revisit \\"Contact\\" [which really makes much more sense]also \\"Solaris\\" [the original] and the subsequent spin-offs ...... [\\"Event Horizon\\"].<br /><br />Tech credits are excellent bearing in mind that the movie was specifically designed for 3-D viewing and should be visited in that format ...... that's the real strength of the piece ..... \\"Performances?\\"  Not really ..... many of the actors appear to be revisiting personal demons .......<br /><br />Sountrack?  Instantly forgetable.<br /><br />Instead of Little Green men?  The Larger - Blue-Gray morose variety .... quaint choice .......<br /><br />but it DOES open the future prospect of DNA - warfare ...... mutate and devolve the enemy!<br /><br />THEN there's always the question of 'deleted scenes' - alternate opening - alternate ending??????  Pretentious ~ now did Hitchcock ever travel this path?  Imagine \\"Psycho\\" with alternate endings, etc ....... perhaps \\"King of Kings\\"? [but now we're into Mel Brooks Country and that deserves a movie unto itself!].

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I rarely bu y a CD these days, but this group is awesome.  Great vocals.  The tile song &#34;Some Nights&#34; is one of the best songs I've heard in a very long time.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|I love this game but it is so addictive<br />If you plan on buying this app plan on spending about 2 house it each day.<br />Although it is pretty fun.....
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I love the app because the jelly fish uses jelly stuff to get a feather to fly. I love the the hats because some come with MUSTACHES&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!
B006ZEDZNY|4.0|This was a funny movie but I wasn't expecting it to be as odd as it was. I would watch again but not the type of movie I call home about.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We have all the other seasons and this was just added to our collection...seems to be exactly like advertised. No complaints
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Purchased this as a gift for my family. They love the game and keep stealing my copy so I got them one too. Very addictive and fun for the whole family!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is ad supported, but it is easy to use and performs as advertised. I expect I will upgrade soon to get access to more features and get rid of ads.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The AccuWeather for Android app is the best weather application of the many I have tried.  It is very accurate in the temp. readings as well as the forecasts.  I purchased the application from<br />the Amazon App store.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|its a cute little game I got a few of my friends to play it as well... they love playing with the little animals..
0385535147|5.0|I have read every Grisham book - buy them the day they hit the shelves.  This book is one of the best and the whole time I was reading this I had all the characters in mind for the (hopefully) movie.  I am a 66 yr. old female and my father is 86 yrs old.  He liked it so much that is he going to reread it in case he missed anything.  I don't why where the negative comments are coming from but the book is incredible and as you read along you find you are reading another book.  The story goes in another direction, with all new characters, and you think &#34;what the heck just happened.&#34;  However long John Grisham practiced law was too long.  He should have been writing  books the whole time.  Over time there have been some books I have liked more than others but I prefer the legal genre which he is best at.  Read this book and I promised you will not be disappointed.
B000000993|5.0|For guitar players this album is the holy grail, I dont care what kind of other stuff are into. I have yet to meet a halfway decent guitar player who likes any kind of metal who does not love this album.
B007V2UGPE|2.0|I played the game and I loved the graphics but what I didnt like was that you dont kill the zombies yourself!!!I want challenge and fun!!!This is just like some loser controlling it for you. Anybody else agree?
B007IXWL2C|3.0|These books get more and more vanilla as they go on and read like your average romance novel.  Nothing that crazy just typical stuff.  The story line is very predictable and I always knew what was going to happen next.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|It's the best animated movie. My kids love it. What I love about it is the songs. This movie is  very musical( what my kids love), colorful, funny , and educational in a sense. I'm an adult and I can watch this movie over again. My kids are in love with this and it's worth every dime. My brother got it for my daughter as a badly gift and she was thrilled. It fun, and one of our favorites. My brother even loves it. I will definitely be purchasing this for my nieces, and nephews for Xmas. Anne Hathaway is one of the characters and Jamie Foxx (they are singing), Tracey Morgan and others. Just GO GET IT.  We love RIo
B004J713JW|5.0|If you love Billy Joel you must get this CD.  You feel the love from the crowd and the spirit that his music creates.  Amazing.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved this book and all her others and I'm waiting for new publications to come out. Love, Love amd Love
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Not just the music but a glimpse into how Celine performs.  Her talent and personality are showcased beautifully in the CD.<br />The quality of the sound was amazing.
1419705849|5.0|My grandsons love this series.  Fun to see the movies and compare the movies to the books.  I highly recommend.
0307592731|5.0|True story puts one right on the trail with Cheryl as she covers 1,000 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail by herself. My kind of gal.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|Why has man never returned to the moon? Apparently we have. In Apollo 18 we learn that NASA and the Department of Defense sent a secret manned mission to the moon in 1974 in order to install a device to spy on Russian communications. The men were outfitted with Kodachrome hand-held cameras in order to document the mission. They never made it back to Earth. A space conspiracy website called “The Lunar Truth” somehow obtained 84 hours of footage from this mission and edited it down to 90 minutes before uploading it onto their website. Apollo 18 is a found footage movie detailing the fate of the astronauts.<br /><br />I love stories that take place in isolated settings and the surface of the moon is about as isolated as you can get. Apollo 18 is yet another “found footage” tale and a fairly effective one at that. The isolation of the moon combined with the claustrophobic interior of the space capsule heightens the tension once otherworldly dangers are encountered. Apollo 18 takes a while to get going and in the interim we watch the 3 astronauts go through the machinations of their job while exchanging stilted conversation about their lives back on Earth. The scares are mostly of the things-that-go-bump-in-the-night variety but they work well here. The final 10 minutes are especially tense/gripping. The found “footage” looks terrific and matches the look of real moon landing footage that we have seen all of our lives. I know that some of you do not enjoy found footage movies (I love them) but for those who do this one is fun.
0385535147|5.0|This is a must read John Grisham.  Lots of twists and turns so lookout for getting fooled at least a couple of times.  One of his best.
032180354X|5.0|It has some nice techniques and teaches a lot. Every begginer should buy it to learn a little. I like it.
B001H5X7I4|2.0|Some of the lines are hilarious and the Tom Cruze creepy dance in the last 10 minutes of the video made it worth sitting through this whole thing. It's a dude flick for sure.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app is so cool. Your walking in a store that is playing a song, all you do is start Shazam, push the button in the middle of your screen & within' seconds it tells you the name,album, or if you want to buy. You can hold it up when a song is playing on your TV or a radio. This is a must. How many times you hear a song and can't remember who sings it or the name of it. And the best part is the price of the app. Everybody needs this app. Very easy to use.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this and can't wait for the next season that's just about to hit. I'm addicted to the Masterpiece theatre.
B0009P66TK|4.0|i was looking for something more extravagant but it's a decent watch if you want attention from the ladies. Nice watch for a young man.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Glad I spend the cash to buy this season. Oh Donald Draper your a hottie even though your a real jerk!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I gave the book a four star rating.  It was full of intrigue and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  There were several surprise moments which I enjoyed.
B0031ES8P6|4.0|Like the product.  Ordered the purple colored outfit.  When it arrived it was pink.  Not sure if they sent the wrong one or if it just doesn't look the same online as it does in person.  The price was better than the ones that I saw in the store.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A little different than his normal read. But blood!<br />He kept me guessing on parts of the story almost<br />to the end.  This will make a great movie !
0679809015|3.0|OK, so i really like this book, the content and the flips, however it is meant for the youngest readers, yet it is so small they can eveh hold it, and forget about turning pages!!
B008M0UTRO|1.0|This is probably a not legal production although it looks very professional<br />It starts with a flash of a commercial.<br />The sound is horrible. The soundtrack music is loud, the sound volume of characters speaking is practically<br />not understandable because of too low volume vs soundtrack.<br />In the end I cannot use this DVD and I'd like my money back.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read!  I held off reading the books, but when I did I couldn't put them down.  I did not see the movie because I wanted to read the books first.  Now I want to see how they told the story in the movie.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Read this before seeing the movie!  It is much easier to follow in the written word.  The movie was very well done but was VERY CONFUSSING since there are 5-6 story-lines running throughout the movie and it was hard to follow.  The dialogue was also hard during some of the segments because of the attempt to follow vinacular of the time period and different locations (some in the future?).
1400067820|1.0|This book should have passed through the hands of an editor, and Taleb should cooperate with the editor.  It has some good ideas about evolution and natural selection applied to business and politics, but the writing is so appallingly bad that I finally gave up in disgust.  It would make a good but short serious article.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|i got addicted to this game and collected lots of prizes then it just stopped working . I have been on with support multiple of times and the problem is still not resolved. I can only restart and load and unload this game so many times. I think its a great game when working, but not worth the frustration.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow.  I'm an avid reader, and it's been a while since a book sucked me in as much as Wool did.  I literally could not put it down.<br /><br />The book starts off really good, and then about 1/3 of the way in, as the world and characters really become fully formed, it transformed from merely interesting/good into literally one of my favorite books of all time.  The characters have depth and complexity, the dialogue feels real rather than contrived, mysteries get answered as new and deeper mysteries unfold and yet this never becomes the least bit frustrating.  Best of all, I was really surprised at many of the turns the book takes.  It was refreshing to find a storyteller not afraid to rip the rug out from under me and take the story off in directions I just never expected.<br /><br />I can't wait to revisit this world, and look forward to dipping my toes into Howey's other works.
B008476HBM|5.0|As good as I remembered it always being. Loved that I was able to read it for free. Definitely recommend it
B0071T3Q9K|4.0|These are great songs from &#34;before my era&#34; but when in the right mood, are great listening. Paul's smooth voice covers them well.
B005LF9OCE|5.0|Can't wait for the full next season to be available.  My husband and I love this show and we have re watched this season many time already!
B000002MUN|4.0|I only remember one song being a big it, the the whole album is typical Tom Petty and pleasant to listen to. I bought it because my daughter chose the title song for the bride/father dance at her wedding and I wanted to keep the memory fresh.
B005I0DV4Y|5.0|I love this movie.  It tells the tale of a New Zealand tribe and its survival.  I would recommend this story.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|This whole series is amazing...the writing, graphics and acting is just mesmorizing.  That and it's got familiar actors in it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I did not expect a fairytale ending but I did expect poetic justice. I agree with other reviews that there is a lack of characters development, rushed fight scenes, loose ends, and a poor ending. Yes war changes you but there was fight in the three main characters and that gets lost. I hope the movie is better
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Just epic awesome.  Great writing and scenery!<br />The whole Spartacus series (Gods, B&S and Vengeance) are absolutely a must-watch (but most definitely not safe for kids).
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Okay, maybe not a Fringe fanatic but I do love me some Fringe. Especially the first season, in my opinion the first, second, and then it tapers off sort of including third, a little bit including fourth. Don't get me wrong I'm still watching the fifth season and I still love the show but just in terms of the best seasons I recommend buying the first one first. Also for chronological reasons do this.
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Makes the MagLite Mini more like a tactical flashlight.  I just wanted simple on/off and this does the trick.  MUCH brighter than the incandescent/xenon counterparts...
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love this game, totally addictive,  100% recommended, it is my best therapy for stress! me gustarian mas actualizaciones. Esta super!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this movie!!! &#60;3  It was wonderful - a bit on the heartbreaking side in the beginning, however, I watched it with a 5 yr old, and the part that made me cry (without the 5 yr old seeing me, lol) went right over his head.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It's a good game, but could be a little longer before having to pay.  Seems to get stuck and not go further.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|Nothing Swans did in the studio up until now matches the ambition of The Seer. It's simply an eclipse of the past, production/lyric/music wise.<br /><br />Swans of today are new as much as they are an old band. My Father Will Guide Me was an anomalous Swans release -- in that it really was a M. Gira solo record played by a group of friends. If you caught their concerts in 2010-2011 however, the live musical evidence made good on their promise as a fully functioning, creative unit moving forward. The Seer is the brainchild of this new incarnation. In my opinion it was meant to return to the awesome, magically deranged & intoxicated state that had always been Swans. Needless to say, it ended up surpassing that. This is quite an accomplishment: not only the recording, but the band itself (especially if your know the history of Swans personnel turbulence).<br /><br />I always felt that Helpless Child was their peak moment in the studio. The Apostate, however to my astonishment, actually trumps it. Just listen. What impressed me about the live material from Swans Are Dead was the bending of song structures -- from track to track, nothing resembling the next. Overall, The Seer is much in that same way. The variable track timings alone somewhat signify that. The album's production has a crisp and full sound, yet is intentionally ragged and choppy. How refreshing after so many years of Angels of Light!<br /><br />The Seer's emotional content really hits dead on. Poignant tracks like A Piece of the Sky (great title!), Avatar and The Daughter Brings the Water make effective extensions of the imaginary world that Swans' past music conjured up for me. Eden Prison is great, yet that last album is blown away!<br /><br />The public seems to really be responding. The Seer may not be my favorite, or yours either. Nevertheless, it is Swan's best and perhaps most successful work.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Very handy -- keeps my Legend safe and topped off.  LED's give indication of status of headset as well as the battery in the case.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|Loved it. I would really like to see them do some more of these. Definitely the best scifi movie I've seen in a long time. Beautifully filmed too.
141659521X|4.0|I love the Mitch Rapp series and I liked this one too. However I would say that Mitch is becomming a little too cartoonish. Before he was a super professional that only the people on the inside of the spy world knew. Now it seems that EVERYONE knows and fears him, and he is not super professional, but spiderman, with the spider sense to tingle if anything is amiss. I still like him but his powers are getting a bit overdone.
B008HI7BMW|5.0|I don't know what is up with the negative reviewers on here but this album is just fine the way it is.  The music sounds just fine.  It does not need a remaster.  I listened to it in my truck cd player and it sounded awesome.<br />If any of you guys like the movie, get this album.  It's worth the money.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We have been buying the Lego advent calendar's for years now and the kids love them.  We have 2 kids, so one takes the even days and the other the odd days.  The next year we switch so every other year they will get to open the 24th box which tends to be the Santa/Christmas related one.  Our 4 year old has the even days this year and on the morning of the 5th in he said, &#34;Can I just go to sleep now and when I wake up it'll be the 6th?&#34;.  So for the little ones, it gives them a little extra incentive to go to bed during December. One tip we've learned is to cut the flap/instructions off the box and store them with the rest of your Lego instruction booklets so they can build the sets any time.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|This CD is contagious. It's soooo catchy. Very up beat. I don't even know which album I like better. As for the extra pictures and little interview included, it takes about 2 seconds to look through that part. Maybe I was just really excited when it first came out. But unless you are going to look at the pictures everyday, you should probably just invest in the one from Target. I think it's cheaper.
B00688628M|5.0|In September 2001, only a few days before the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, there began on the Home Box Office (HBO) cable network one of the most extraordinary television mini-series I have ever seen. Entitled \\"Band of Brothers,\\" that mini-series told in dramatic fashion and with exquisite eloquence the true story of one of the most famous and highly decorated U.S. Army units to fight during World War II: Easy Company of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. In 2002,  \\"Band of Brothers\\" was released DVD; in 2008 a six-disc Blu-ray edition was published, and now it is available on Amazon Instant Video in high definition digital format.<br /><br />For those not familiar with \\"Band of Brothers,\\" it's based upon the equally outstanding book entitled \\"Band of Brothers: E Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne from Normandy to Hitler's Eagle's Nest,\\" by the late Stephen E. Ambrose.  It describes in stunning detail the exploits of Easy Company, from its initial airborne landing in Normandy on D-Day; through its participation in Operation Market-Garden in September 1944 and its tenacious defense of Bastogne in December 1944; to its capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest at Berchtesgaden in April 1945.<br /><br />The original HBO mini-series is divided into ten episodes, each about one hour long. The entire project - which cost an estimated $125 million to produce - has as its executive producers Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, and Stephen Ambrose.<br /><br />With such cinematic luminaries leading the production team, one would expect \\"Band of Brothers\\" to be outstanding in every respect, and it does not disappoint. Taken as a whole, the ten episodes provide a highly accurate and faithful chronology of the events narrated by Ambrose in his book, while at the same time providing viewers with superb acting, writing, cinematography, music, costumes, and sound. Taken separately, each episode stands as a powerful and gritty testament to the patriotism, heroism, and character of the men of Easy Company.<br /><br />It's impossible to describe with full justice how good \\"Band of Brothers\\" is. It is, for me, the nearly perfect war chronicle: an accurate depiction of real events; arrayed with a stellar cast, including many unknown actors who have made a name for themselves as a result of their work in this film (among them, most notably: Damian Lewis; Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston; Dale Dye (who also served as the series' military advisor); Frank John Hughes; and Rick Gomez.<br /><br />I now own the complete \\"Band of Brothers\\" miniseries in three formats: DVD (purchased 2003); Blu-Ray (2011); and now in digital format through my Amazon Prime membership. I think the digital format provides the clearest, sharpest, and most vibrant audio and video of the three formats I own. I have already watched several episodes on my Kindle Fire HD, and I can say without hesitation that the experience was superb in every way. It certainly made the purchase of this series well worth the price. (Of course, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can view \\"Band of Brothers\\" for free.)<br /><br />MY VERDICT:  No matter what format you own, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is truly outstanding.  Along with its sister miniseries \\"The Pacific\\" (2010), it is simply the best war story I've ever seen in any cinematic medium. Both \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"The Pacific\\" deserve honored places in any home video collection.to the patriotism, heroism, and character of the men of Easy Company.<br /><br />It's impossible to describe with full justice how good \\"Band of Brothers\\" is. It is, for me, the nearly perfect war chronicle: an accurate depiction of real events; arrayed with a stellar cast, including many unknown actors who have made a name for themselves as a result of their work in this film (among them, most notably: Damian Lewis; Donnie Wahlberg, Ron Livingston; Dale Dye (who also served as the series' military advisor); Frank John Hughes; and Rick Gomez.<br /><br />I now own the complete \\"Band of Brothers\\" miniseries in three formats: DVD (purchased 2003); Blu-Ray (2011); and now in digital format through my Amazon Prime membership. I think the digital format provides the clearest, sharpest, and most vibrant audio and video of the three formats I own. I have already watched several episodes on my Kindle Fire HD, and I can say without hesitation that the experience was superb in every way. It certainly made the purchase of this series well worth the price. (Of course, if you're an Amazon Prime member, you can view \\"Band of Brothers\\" for free.)<br /><br />MY VERDICT:  No matter what format you own, \\"Band of Brothers\\" is truly outstanding.  Along with its sister miniseries \\"The Pacific\\" (2010), it is simply the best war story I've ever seen in any cinematic medium. Both \\"Band of Brothers\\" and \\"The Pacific\\" deserve honored places in any home video collection.

B007MNV5WU|3.0|My nephew loved this game till we realized that certain planets on the board cost money to open up. Seeing how the game itself costs me $2.99 I foulnd this to be a bit of an overkill, thank you George Lucas. I'm still on the first planet since I've been lettinga 5 year old play it mainly and he truly loves the game. Each \\"bird\\" has special abilities which adds ease (and sometimes difficulty) to the game. I'll be honest I'm not familiar with Stars Wars, the only on I ever watched was the original first one released but I do find the game fun. I just don't like that it cost money for some planets to open up (I know of one, I'm not sure if there are more) and that you can buy things on it. Definetly different from all the other Angry Birds I've purchased (for free with adds). So I guess it's worth it but just beware that you may end up spending more money than the intial cost.

B009IRVSVQ|1.0|I was super excited to get this CD because I had been streaming it from the Bruno Mars CD for a week. Unfortunately when I recieved it, it will not play in my car (the whole reason I bought the CD instead of downloading it on my computer). Then I find out that there is a deluxe version with additional tracks (avaliable at Target). I am majorly disappointed. Not in the music (obviously) but in the product provided by Amazon. Also, when I bought it (a week ago) I was told I would get it it the day the CD came out (12/11/12) but I actually did not recieve it until 12/12/12. Overall, I am majorly disappointed by Amazon's service. But the music itself is AWESOME!

0152465073|5.0|This Harvest book 1971 edition is the Katherine Woods translation, first published in 1943. Katherine Woods' simple and beautiful translation is the only one that does justice to The Little Prince. Published by Harcourt in 1943 and 1971, her translation is the essential --- the translation loved and quoted by English-speaking people around the world, even by members of English- and French-speaking Canadian Parliament! But hers is OUT OF PRINT, so snatch up used copies while you may!<br /><br />WARNING: there is a \\"new translation\\" out by Richard Howard, and I accidentally got one. Ouch! His \\"New\\" translation purges meaning, and is not worth the money. It gives a falseness to one of the most sincere stories ever written.<br /><br />Howard's lacks beauty, and is at times unintelligible: It simply does not make sense. Since Howard has no apparent understanding of the truths expressed in The Little Prince, it is not to be wondered at. One important example says it all: The fox's \\"secret\\" told to the little prince in parting ---<br /><br />Woods' translation reads: \\"It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.\\"  She uses the beautiful rhetorical mode: \\"What is essential...\\" Compare, if you know French, Antoine de Saint Exupéry's original French text: \\"...on ne voit bien qu'avec le coeur. L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux.\\" \\"L'essentiel\\" is in the same mode as is \\"Les Misérables\\" -- neither translate exactly into English. \\"Les Misérables\\" may be translated as \\"The Miserable Ones,\\" with less poetic effect. Likewise, \\"L'essentiel\\" might be rendered literally \\"The essential things\\" or put in the rhetorical form \\"What is essential...\\"<br /><br />If Richard Howard wanted to make the statement \\"clearer\\" it would have to read: \\"That which is essential is invisible to the eye\\" --- wordy, and prosy, but it keeps the meaning.

It epitomizes her entire translation. (Note: it is Katherine Woods who employs the English poetic \\"eye\\" for \\"les yeux\\", a superior choice of wording.) It is ironic that, in translating The Little Prince, Richard Howard should lose \\"that which is essential,\\" and that he should be unable to \\"see with his heart.\\"<br /><br />Amazon.com's Editorial Review on HOWARD'S translation says that \\"Katherine Woods sometimes wandered off the mark, giving the text a slightly wooden or didactic accent. Happily, Richard Howard...has streamlined and simplified to wonderful effect.\\"<br /><br />This would have been better written thus:<br /><br />\\"Katherine Woods uses poetic devices and a didactic accent to wonderful effect, capturing the essence and meaning of Antoine de Saint Exupéry's classic tale in a timeless translation.

We'd spent so much time with her. And, as the fox says to the little prince in explaining why HIS rose is so important to him, \\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.\\" It also helps me keep in mind what I'm doing with my time, andwhy. If I watch T.V. the most, then T.V. becomes the most important. If I pass the time with my family, they become the most important.<br /><br />Another always-to-be-remembered example of a passage from Woods' translation occurs when the little prince must say goodbye to the fox:<br /><br />The fox says, \\"Ah, I shall cry.\\"<br /><br />\\"It's your own fault,\\" said the little prince. \\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you...\\"<br /><br />\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.<br /><br />\\"But now you are going to cry!\\" said the little prince.<br /><br />\\"Yes, that is so,\\" said the fox.<br /><br />\\"Then it has done you no good at all!\\"<br /><br />\\"It has done me good,\\" said the fox, \\"because of the color of the wheat fields.\\"<br /><br />Before the little prince tamed the fox, the wheat field had \\"nothing to say to\\" the fox. \\"But,\\" he had said to the little prince, \\"you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat...\\"<br /><br />I used to dislike giant sunflowers. Then I discovered that someone I love liked them very much. So we planted some and cared for them together. Now, when I see giant sunflowers, I remember him and my heart is happy.

The pictures are in grayscale, not color, and the paper is similar to newsprint.<br /><br />There is a PDF of the Woods translation. Search under The Little Prince swan.<br />It's not a bound-book-in-hand, but it's at least the superior translation of Woods' and it's free.<br /><br />One way to get the Katherine Woods' translation is to make sure you are buying ISBN: 0-15-246507-3 (0152465073). As for Howard's translation, \\"NEW\\" is not better; it's just \\"new.\\"  Sometimes you can tell the difference between the two translations simply by the covers.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|WWI is the backdrop for this story of hope and friendship between a boy and a horse.<br />Directed by Steven Spielberg, with major roles by Jeremy Irvine (Albert), Emily Watson playing his mother, and Niels Arestrup.<br />Jeremy Irvine is also Pip now in the just released (2012) Great Expectations.<br /><br />The story follows Joey, the horse, as he is born, bought by Albert's father, sold to the cavalry, captured by the Germans, and on. Many interesting characters interact with Joey, some view animals as things for exploitation, and many have very sympathetic, loving reactions. Fortunately, those that care rescue Joey on the several occasions he needs help.<br /><br />It's a great movie, not too gory and not manipulative, just great.

B001EYGOG0|5.0|Singers gradually lose their vocal range when they get old, but Tony Bennett adapted well on this recording. He is, of course, hugely helped by the Count Basie Band, who ensure that the music swings along where appropriate. Most old singers tend to focus on ballads, but Tony mixes ballads and up-tempo swinging songs on this album, even performing I'll be home for Christmas (normally a wistful ballad) as an up-tempo song. Another song that sounds distinctive is Silver bells, on which the difference is less dramatic than I'll be home for Christmas, but still noticeable. My favorite things isn't really a Christmas song although it mentions snow, but I've found it on several Christmas albums, and Tony's version swings.<br /><br />Tony shows his way with ballads on All I want for Christmas is you (a cover of the Mandel, Bergman and Bergman song), Christmas time is here and Christmas waltz.<br /><br />His daughter Antonia joins Tony for a duet version of I've got my love to keep me warm. Lyrically, it's not really a song for a father and daughter to sing together, but it works well despite that.<br /><br />This is a brilliant Christmas album, and not just for jazz fans.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I liked this movie. I didn't grow up reaing the comics but from what I've heard there were some storyline discrepencies.
B007HJHO2O|3.0|Generally I like the songs and the writing that went into King of Number 33.  However, there are some things that I hope DeeExpus changes when their next album is released.<br />  On all songs except Memo the lead vocal is weak.  There is no presence to the singer's voice.  Maybe if they bring in the guy who sings Memo to do leads next time it will help.<br />  Next bit of whining I want to do concerns the mixing.  The bass (or guitar chords in some sections?) and drums are overpowering.  There are sections where the keyboard is building and developing certain sections and it can barely be heard.  The producer should be replaced.  If you listen to, for just one example, the early Genesis album Nursery Chryme, you can hear the balance I'm talking about.  Balance between instruments is, for the most part, lacking on King of Number 33.  The emphasis placed on bass and drums ruins the listening experience and I had to listen to the title track several times before I liked it at all, simply because I couldn't hear the different parts because of the overpowering bass & drums.<br />  On the positive side, once I was able to focus in on the construction of the songs, I found most of the songs interesting.  The first song, Me and My Downfall, is absolutely killer.  I loved everything about it.  The vocal range is right in the singer's wheelhouse and he managed to project.  (Still, these vocals were not particularly strong but they do serve the song.)  The balance between the instruments is good.  The imagery created by the lyrics is solid and makes it easy to buy into the song's premise.  The development of the sections of the song and the transitions between sections are fresh.  The band really has a great creative spark.<br />  The title track was a bit disappointing.  The vocals were perhaps the weakest on the entire album.  There is too much instrumental repetition.  The spark of creativity shown on the first track is not nearly as evident here.  It seems the band was bound and determined to write an epic length prodg suite and they were going to do it even if it meant boring the listener to achieve that goal.  If they would have cut it in half maybe I'd feel differently.  Again, after several listenings in order to hear past the overpowering bass and drums, I think I can hear what they were trying to do, (maybe I can't), but IMO it doesn't work here.<br />  All my seeming negativity aside, I look forward to the next album.  The creative spark is very real with DeeExpus and I can't wait to see where it leads them.  I only hope a good producer is along for the ride next time.

B001USHRCK|2.0|The legos I  ordered were exactly as advertised on the site. No problem with the actual product. Very unhappy about the fact that it was left in a cardboard box with no plastic around it to sit in the pouring rain, all day.  Most of the box was ruined.  I have never had this happen before with anyone I have ordered with through amazon and was shocked to see it as such.  I would have re-ordered but was worried I would not receive it in time for Christmas.  I will not order from this store again.

B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Abby Abernathy is a good girl, or at least she is trying to be. She has fled her hometown to attend Eastern University and escape her past. Travis Maddox is the epitome of a bad boy - covered in tattoos, earns money fighting in an underground fight club, and is notorious for his one night stands. When Abby meets Travis at one of his fights, she is instinctively drawn to him and Travis is intrigued by her outward disdain for him. The truth is that neither one can stay away from the other. When Abby loses a bet, she must live with Travis for one month. The more time the two of them spend together the more complicated and entwined their relationship becomes, bring them both to the point of destruction.<br /><br />I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It is basically a twist on Beauty and the Beast. Abby is not as innocent as Belle is, but she is the antidote to Travis' beastly ways. She's no angel herself however. She often pushes Travis' buttons and tries to provoke a response from him, even though she knows he is a bomb waiting to explode. Travis is a much more complex character than Abby, and I was disappointed that we do not get to learn more about his back story, because it might explain why he is the way that he is. He is certainly not the perfect male lead. In fact he is really more of a cautionary tale. He is jealous, possessive, prone to violence, and borderline abusive. I found myself cringing sometimes when reading this book over the things Travis did, because they are simply not acceptable in a healthy relationship. He was not the dark angel for me, he is simply just dark. In the end, they do definitely deserve each other and I guess you can say that they save each other. I just not sure if either of them is a better person because of it.<br /><br />Book two, Walking Disaster, is due to be published in April 2013 and is the same story told from Travis' point of view. I have to admit that I am intrigued by this and will most likely be picking the book up when it comes out. For me, Travis is the more interesting and complex character of the two and I am looking forward to reading the story through his eyes.<br /><br />See more of my book reviews at [...]t.

Otherwise Snuff was a joy to read ... Terry - you make me laugh a LOT.
B0083GCK5G|4.0|Wow! In 2012, the Beach Boys come out with a new, quality album. Who would have thought?<br /><br />This album is really good with only one weak song - Private Life of Bill & Sue. The music tends towards the 70s styles of the Beach Boys versus the 60s music that everyone knows. I really like the 70s psychedelic music so this was no problem for me.<br /><br />They stretch out a little but keep the catchy, vocal harmony oriented music everyone associates with the Beach Boys. Best song for me is &#34;That's Why God Made the Radio&#34;.

B008U74U56|4.0|I had never heard of Bill Fay until I saw the review of this album. I bought it on a whim. I'm glad I did. It is a great album of thoughtful music. It tends to be in the folk-rock and singer-songwriter styles but very different than those names suggest. Bill Fay is a very intelligent and original songwriter. One caution is this album does tend towards the melancholic side of things. Still it is an original work that will make you look at the world around you with different eyes after listening to it.

B0083TXXZ4|1.0|Bought this for my son for his birthday.  The whole family was excited to try it, and all of us were disappointed to use it.  While it does send out a barrage of darts (fun), every fifth dart or so mis-fired (not fun).  Maybe we just got a defective unit, but I was looking at the design of the finger that feeds the darts from the clip to the motor and there seems to be a flaw in the design. It's triangular and seems to only hit the top half of the dart.  This deforms the dart on the part the feeder touches, and if the dart doesn't go into the chamber for some reason, it ends up ripping the dart.<br /><br />A neat idea, but a no go for us.  We ended up returning to Amazon and picking up the Rayven instead.  So far, that's working out great!!

B008C401YG|5.0|Sean Rowe's knock out baritone voice is matched only by his songwriting. Beautiful. Dark. Seductive. Echoes of nature and a mistrust of all things conventional triumph on this album as they have on Sean's previous albums. The energy on tracks like Downwind and Joe's Cult bring to mind Sean's live show. Sean Rowe is a must listen and a must see performer. If you like John Lee Hooker, Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits you will love Sean Rowe.

B009PODB76|5.0|\\"So you be who you wanna be and I'll be me...\\"<br />- 'Knocked Out'<br /><br />It's been five years since Delta Goodrem released new material, so to say that her fourth album, \\"Child of the Universe\\", was highly anticipated would be a massive understatement. After the piano-laden, acoustic-rock sounds of \\"Innocent Eyes\\" and the anger on \\"Mistaken Identity\\", Goodrem turned toward pop on her third record, \\"Delta\\". On this one, she's both gone back to her roots and continued moving forward. \\"Child of the Universe\\" is a definite step ahead in the continued evolution of the Australian singer.<br /><br />Immediately it's obvious that this album is different; the title track opens with a full orchestra and is about the nature of the universe. 'Knocked Out' is an in-your-face anthem about Goodrem's often-criticized appearance as a coach on the Australian version of \\"The Voice\\", while 'The Speed of Life' channels Leona Lewis in a near-R&B song about the fear of taking risks. Other highlights include the tracks seemingly-written about Delta's breakup with her long-time fiancé, Irish singer Brian McFadden, and include 'Hunters and the Wolves', dance tune 'Dancing with a Broken Heart', and ballad 'I'm Not Ready'. In addition, songs like the indie-sounding 'Touch', which is about the Butterfly Effect, and lead single 'Sitting on Top of the World', a sugary pop tune about embracing the positive, sparkle.<br /><br />Always known for her poetic lyrics, Delta's greatest writing achievement is probably the heart-wrenching ballad 'Wish You Were Here', about life in the aftermath of the death of a loved one. \\"Instead of just in my dreams and my imagination / Confusing me completely from another dimension / Can you see the beauty from a new beginning somewhere?\\" And 'The Speed of Life' is lyrical gold from start to finish, with poignant lines like \\"How many dreams can you break / Till you're broken?\\"<br /><br />There are, however, a few criticisms of the album. While I understand the premise behind 'Safe to Believe' (and love the acoustic version included on the deluxe edition), the album version of the song is an attempt to sound like Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston that just doesn't quite make it. And though 'When My Stars Come Out' does a great job of showing Goodrem's powerful voice, it's not exactly my cup of tea. When compared with non-album B-sides 'Rise', `Daughter', 'Waiting for Forever', and 'Uncovered', which were released with her first three singles, I don't understand how some of these tracks made the cut while other, better songs were left off.<br /><br />Overall, though, \\"Child of the Universe\\" is an incredible album that is sure to satisfy both those who were a bit unhappy about the poppiness of \\"Delta\\" and those who loved the new direction. For those who want a different spin on the songs, I highly recommend the Deluxe Edition, which features acoustic versions of eleven tracks and brings them to life in a new way. This is on album that was a long time coming but has been well-worth the wait.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|Great cast, Abba music, charming story. DVD for lower cost is fine. Not a special effects movie so consider Blu-Ray optional.

B002JH3TW8|4.0|I have had this adapter for a year or more now.<br /><br />It works as expected. No complaints there.<br /><br />I like the fact it has a small length of cable (about 2.5 inches) in it. This eliminates putting excess sideways stain on the port. The flex in the little cable takes allows for bending in any direction.<br /><br />My only concern is the ridiculous price.<br /><br />It's a little under $15 for this tiny piece of plastic and less than 3 inches of cable. That seems a bit over-the-top. Basically any buying this is effectively buying a 2.5in FireWire 800/400 cable for $15.<br /><br />For under half the price we can buy 6ft FireWire 800/400 cables. That makes a lot more sense to me, and it eliminates needing a separate adapter piece. Just one less thing to go wrong with connections.<br /><br />I need a few more 800/400 adapters today, and rather than getting more of these Moshi adapters, or the other solid adapters (i.e. the ones without any cable in them - which go for around $5) I will instead buy a few 6ft 800/400 cables. I would rather have 2 or 4 ft cables, but only the 6th have free Prime shipping (at this time - Dec 15 2012), and they seem to have a better price in many cases.<br /><br />As I write this there are three similar and equally good looking options for 800/400 FW cables:<br />- [[ASIN:B0027DPM1U Oyen Digital Firewire 800/400 IEEE 1394B Cable - 9 to 6 Pin (9pin 6pin) - 4FT]] (doesn't have Prime shipping at this time, but it does have a free lifetime 7GB online storage account with SpiderOak - whoever that is)<br />- [[ASIN:B002U5MFX8 CiTi - FireWire Gold 800 to 400 9 to 6 pin Cable (9pin 6pin) 6FT , IEEE-1394B Firewire 800 9-pin/6-pin Cable 6 FEET GOLD PLATED TIP]]<br />- [[ASIN:B000AAZQLI Tripp Lite F017-006 IEEE 1394b Firewire 6 feet 800 Gold Hi-speed Cable - 9 Pin/6 Pin]] (the Amazon description on this one claims 800 Mbps throughput, which seems somewhat pointless considering a FireWire 400 device or controller is going to be involved on one end of the cable, which effectively limits throughput to 400 Mbps no matter what)<br /><br />I suspect in most usage scenarios 800/400 cables such as these are going to be a better and cheaper (and, possibly, more reliable) option than this $15 2.4in Moshi cable/adapter).ne end of the cable, which effectively limits throughput to 400 Mbps no matter what)<br /><br />I suspect in most usage scenarios 800/400 cables such as these are going to be a better and cheaper (and, possibly, more reliable) option than this $15 2.4in Moshi cable/adapter).

0385513755|5.0|Novel intelligently weaves together a body of lore from art history, religious history, symbols, word etymologies, and legends.  I found this much better written than Brown's predecessors (Digital Fortress and Angels & Demons).  It has far less wasted words and is less insulting of the reader's intelligence.  I could make a list of the things that are wrong in the book but, unlike Angels & Demons, they are very few.  For example, the Dead Sea Scrolls have nothing to do with Christianity, there is too much going on in one night, about 20 things happen on a short jet flight from Paris to London that should have taken no more than 1/2 hour.  Some of the logic does not hang together.  But the main point of the book is to present some thought-provoking material in an interesting and suspenseful way, and in that it succeeds quite well.  The detective/action subplot is secondary, in my opinion.  It is a book that makes you think and want to explore more about the topics therein.  The setting in Paris/London and the wealth of knowledge of art and architecture add to its exotic interest.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />The illustrated edition is great.  I liked having photographs of the places and artwork mentioned in the book.  You can find it all on the web of course, but it is handier to have it on the same page.<br /><br />As to whether the \\"history\\" in the book is true, I just remark that the book is clearly labeled \\"Fiction\\".  There is much legend inside, and whether you want to believe that as history is left up to each reader to do their own thinking and research.<br /><br />PS I watched the movie first and then read the book.  All I can say is I am grateful that the movie did not spoil the book.  I was able to enjoy both, the movie as fast-movie entertainment that sticks to the spirit of the story, and the book as a more leisurely read that I can put down to think about the implications of things.<br /><br />PSS I just find it odd that Sophie is usually called by her first name, while Langdon is called by the last name.

0823023494|4.0|this book definitely has some great gems as far as information on character designs is concerned.  It has a lot of information that will really bring your characters up a few levels above average.  There are tons of stuff in there that you won't find anywhere else, or maybe you will but they just won't be organized and collected in one place such as this.  Tom makes the book very approachable and entertaining.  That makes it fun to read and much easier to go through the whole thing.  I especially LOVE the guest artists and their respective takes on the same character.  very unique approach.<br /><br />The one star knock is for this...  And this might sound mean but it's an honest opinion.  I feel like learning from Tom is great but it's like learning from a 2nd string NFL quarterback.  Everything he's teaching you should be useful to more than 98% of the average public out there.  I'm not saying that I'm anywhere above those 98% (not even close!!) but I definitely have seen the top 2% of the industry's work and that's what I want.  Someone like Carter Goodrich, Nico Marlet or Carols Grangel.  one of those top dudes need to come out with such a book.  sorry to be hyper critical but that's just the way it is.<br /><br />I still love this book and everything it's taught me though.  buy it!!! Tom is a funny dude and his information is definitely worth whatever he's charging here.

Not only does it cover all relevant taxes, it shows how they interact.  This in itself is a major benefit to the tax practitioner bearing in mind that, as consultant editor Patrick Cannon points out, property taxation is the most varied and challenging area of the UK tax system.<br /><br />Certainly the book's detailed table of contents reflects the sheer diversity of UK property taxation, with chapters on everything from investment versus dealing and real estate investment trusts, to agricultural land, woodlands, capital gains tax and VAT and a lot more besides.  Finally, there are specialist chapters on Islamic funding structures and property planning in a recession.<br /><br />Patrick Cannon, by the way, who practices at Tax Chambers, Lincoln's Inn, is also the author of two other Tolley's publications and numerous others which can be viewed online.  He leads a team here of 20 other leading tax specialist contributors, no less, all of whom have updated their own chapters for this edition.<br /><br />Indeed this new edition provides much new material - crucial for keeping  up to date - including additional rules on capital allowance changes...changes to the Community Infrastructure Levy... changes in DOTAS and VAT...developments in SDLT -- Stamp Duty Land Tax - and of course, much more.<br /><br />Within its more than 1,000 pages, the book more than fulfills its stated aim of being `a comprehensive source of analysis and explanation of UK property taxation'.  As you would also expect, there are ample tools for research, including extensive tables of statutes, statutory instruments and European legislation. The detailed index at the back facilitates navigation.<br /><br />Writing in the foreword, Liz Pearce, Chief Executive of the British Property Foundation, refers to this quite indispensable publication as `the essential tax guide to all those who want to get the best out of their property transactions - whatever the challenges faced including by the market!'<br /><br />The publication date for this authoritative and dependable volume is stated as at 2012.taxation'.

0425264351|1.0|This is my first (and probably last) Lee Child read. The book is so flawed and poorly written that 48% into it (in Kindle terms)I am about to put it down and forget about it. Not sure if Mr. Childs knows how things happen in the real world but I cannot jump into his were things seem to happen or not happen for no reason at all. The Top Guy, the brilliant man who heads the counterfeit division of the Treasury Department is brutally killed in a small hick town and there is NO investigation. No need, let the acting Police Chief (acting because the former chief and his wife were brutally murdered in the same week) take care of it. Have Reacher go to a big bank in Atlanta and because he says he is a friend of former key employee, the bank gives him all the information on the employee, who happened to be let go eighteen months ago.  I have to stop there....are we on Earth.<br /><br />Not only flawed, but silly, stupid, shows a lack of knowledge of human nature, society and, and assumes his readers are unthinking fools.<br /><br />Have to put this book down for awhile, until I am really bored. Maybe I will finish it sometime As for the rest in the series....I will pass<br /><br />Maybe child (Child)like is an appropriate characteristic for the writers style and depth of content.

But soon you'll be thinking about the arrangements of these songs. By far one of the top 35 LP's by Dylan. Name a bad one? But honestly folks, if you are on the fence and checking out the mid career of Dylan, looking to fill in the gaps in your catalog from the late 70's and 80's LP's and wondering where to start....start here. Infidels is just as solid too.

1439152802|5.0|This one rates a high 4.5 out of 5 stars.  There is more than one secret keeper in this engrossing tale that switches between modern-day England and England circa WWII.  I've enjoyed Kate Morton's books before, and this one more than lives up to my expectations.<br /><br />There are three narrators in the story, and Laurel, the first, has an idyllic childhood with loving parents until she spies something she was never meant to see, and buries the memory the best she can.  But memories have a way of resurfacing, bringing mysteries along.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful, descriptive but not overly so.  The characters are all interesting, and I especially liked the very different personalities of Laurel's siblings.  The story moves along at a good pace, and the ending caught me off guard.<br /><br />I think fans of Kate Morton will really enjoy this latest novel.<br /><br />Thank you to Atria for giving me an advance reader's copy.

Only to receive a watch that is not working.  Are you serious WATCH-HUB?????  I was certain that you checked my credit card before sending this defective item off to me.  So the least you guys could do was check the watch to make sure it works.  The second hand ticks, but nothing else moves.<br /><br />Yes you claim to give full refund or exchange, but the damage has already been done.  I would NEVER buy another item from WATCH-HUB!!!<br /><br />And if I dont get a full refund on ALL cost.  I will continue to show how disgruntled I am!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Personally, I don't care for Matt Damon's acting it leaves a lot to be desired. However, when Jeremy Renner stepped into the role I certainly wanted to see where the trilogy plus was going. This is a great movie, with good consistent story line and some really amazing action stunts. So for those out there, who enjoy the rogue agent and enemy of the state movies, this is it! Definitely worth the watch and keeping.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|After reading reviews I understood that it was not going to be exactly the same as a computer. But the way it feels is a huge improvement over the controller. I didn't have the money to go out and buy a gaming computer just to play MW3 and I had a lot of friends that play on the PS3. Once you learn how to calibrate it to fit your needs it is a great product and should improve your game. I was doing well with the controller, and even better with the mouse and keyboard. The price was very reasonable considering that it's the same price as a controller. I had an extra mouse and keyboard (some simple logitech ones from walmart) that worked great.<br /><br />Although you might want to turn down your headset volume before you start using this item. People will get mad at you for beating them constantly and use fowl language very loudly to tell you so.

B0061JPYX2|3.0|It's hard to critique an album that seems to be incomplete, for I bet if Amy Winehouse were alive this album would not have turned out this way. But to be frank her voice wasn't as alluring as it was on her previous albums. Despite that, and despite the fact that some of the songs are already ones she had previously released, this was the best that could be round up for her posthumously. For what it is, it's a pretty good album. It just doesn't grab me like her first two did, and there are tracks that I do not ever imagine myself really listening to. It's all around sad that she couldn't be here for it's completion, but it's a pretty ok effort for what her label I guess could do.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br />Tears Dry<br />Valerie<br />Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?<br />The Girl from Ipanema
B003H6KRIE|5.0|what can I say I love this moves and I want to have this collection for me and for my family.
B000PKG7I4|4.0|It wasn't until her second album that I found out about Amy Winehouse after she blew up in the United States. I had to check out who this person was, and that is how I found out she had previously released music out there. This album is such a great collection of music, and is definitely lighter than the music she put out on her sophomore debut. It's unfortunate that this is one of the few albums we will ever be able to hear from her again.<br /><br />Favorite Tracks:<br />Stronger Than Me<br />F Me Pumps<br />You Sent Me Flying/Cherry<br />Amy Amy Amy
B00005N6KG|5.0|I cannot use any buds because the opening in my ears are too small.  These are perfect.  They sit outside the opening and I hear perfectly.  Definitely recommend them.

B005LAIIGC|5.0|I have seen a lot of movies and this movie has the most amazing graphics and best 3D I have ever seen. I felt like I was in the same room as the scenes. The snowflakes come right at you and make you feel like it is really snowing on you. The man in the moon needs the help of The Guardians to defeat the evil pitch. The Guardians are amazing. The animators and writers do a stupendous job of creating believable characters. The Guardians consist of Santa, who is from Russia - He is jolly and lives in an amazing castle. He has the cutest elves with jingle bells on their heads. They are very funny and helpful. The Easter bunny - who is tough, from Australia and has a boomerang. His adorable eggs actually have legs and can run around. The Tooth Fairy is very different; she is a bird. She has pink wings and blue and green feathers. Her baby birds that help her are the sweetest little creatures. The Sandman is the one who makes all your dreams come true while you are sleeping.<br /><br />The graphics for his amazing talents are fabulous. Jack Frost is one of my favorites. Everything he touches turn into frost. The animation of the frost covering everything is absolutely beautiful. Pitch wants the world to be dark and sad and to lose all hope. The children keep the world safe by having hope. Santa has a magic globe which is bright with lights as long as the children believe but once they stop believing their light goes out. The intricate design of the scenery is the best I have ever seen. Everything, from smallest detail to the large wondering dinosaurs, is breath taking.<br /><br />This movie is humorous, adorable and magical. My favorite scenes are when the Easter Bunny goes on a sleigh ride with Santa Clause and when the baby eggs are running around. The Sandman's magic makes your heart glow. The message is to stop and find out what makes you special. You have to find out what it is that you do best and find your center so you know how to make yourself and others happy.<br /><br />I loved this movie that mixes up holidays so you can watch it year round and get into the mood for the seasons. I recommend this for ages 6 and up. Pitch is frightening. The oversized Santa might be too much for the little ones because I am not joking he looks like you are right next to him. I give this movie 5 out 5 twinkling stars. Morgan B, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />A magical movie with all your favorite childhood Guardians who come together to protect the children. Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher), Sandman and Jack Frost (Chris Pine) are chosen by the Man in the Moon to guard the children. They make sure that all children have wonderful dreams and faith. The more the children believe in the Guardians the more power they have. However, the Boogieman (Jude Law) rises to take over the sweet dreams and create nightmares and children begin to lose faith in the Guardians. Without faith or belief, the Guardians will disappear, the lights will turn off and the earth will be filled with darkness. This is when the Guardians join forces to fight the Boogieman. However, Jack Frost does not join forces to fight. He just wants to have fun and not worry about anything.<br /><br />There are so many funny lines in this movie. My favorite part is when the Tooth Fairy looks at the collection of teeth; she knows which one flosses and exactly who it belongs to. I did not like the Boogieman because he seems so real and I don't want to see him when I sleep. The 3D special effects in this movie are so clear; they are unbelievable. When Jack Frost is flying it feels like you are flying with him and you can actually feel the cold air. The rivers of colors are so bright and clear. However, the music is so-so - not very exciting. The lesson in this movie is find your passion and you will know your purpose in life. The costumes are so awesome, especially the Fairies and Santa and his elves. The message in this movie is that joining forces can be more powerful than being by yourself. My favorite character is Jack Frost. He's very fun.<br /><br />I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 3 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />This movie is awesome. It has a lot of action, a lot of funny parts, and I guess there could be some parts that can be seen as scary too. This movie is all about a guy named Jack Frost who came out of the ice but no one believes in him and so no one can see him. So he is turned into a guardian because the moon chooses him. Kind of strange, right? Well he was chosen to help save the world. He meets a lot of other guardians too but they aren't very nice at first so he isn't sure if he wants to be a guardian! Some of the main characters in the movie are Jack Frost, North, Tooth, Bunny, Pitch, and Jamie.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Jack Frost and Jamie because Jack Frost doesn't want to be a guardian at first but then he fights Pitch and decides he would like to help the world which I like. Jaime is a good boy who believes in the guardians no matter what. He loves to have fun like me, so that proves he is a good character. I hope you like them as much as I do. My favorite part in the movie is when Jack Frost sees his memories because he learns that he had a sister and he saved her from falling in the ice. Sadly he didn't make it and fell into the ice. I felt so bad that he didn't make it but it was good that he saved his sister.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for ages 4 and up. Pitch can be a little scary at times but I love the movie and there isn't too much to be scared about. Go out and see this movie in theaters on November 21. Anthony A, KIDS FIRST!

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great books I really enjoyed them. Very interesting story and plot. I did not expect the plot to go where it did in the first books. It kept me guessing of what would happen next and I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />The books are also very well written, the writing reminded me of Stephen King, as others have pointed out, in the sense that it's very descriptive. I had to read it any chance I could get. Very few books have had that effect one.<br /><br />I'm looking forward for the next books.
B005LAIII0|5.0|The most amazing 3D quality movie that shows underwater footage and sea life. Life of Pi is base on a popular book by Yann Martel's novel that sold over 7 million copies. It's about a boy name Piscine Patel known as Pi (Suraj Sharma). He has a good life growing up in his father's zoo in Pondicherry, a French colony. Due to hard times, they have to close down the zoo and move some of the animals to Canada with them. The move to Canada is in a big Japanese cargo ship and all the animals are at the bottom of the ship.<br /><br />A big storm hits the ship and sinks it. The survivors are Pi, a tiger (Richard Parker), zebra, hyena, orangutan and a rat. They are all in a small life boat from the cargo ship. After several days, the only two survivors are Pi and Richard Parker. They were afraid of each other but need each other to survive.<br /><br />There are so many scenes with great cinema-photography. The most memorable ones are the underwater footage and the sinking of the cargo ship is so real and clear. The 3D brings out the glowing of the jelly fish and the blue wale vividly. Special effects of the tiger is the best part. It seems so real, I thought that the tiger is actually in the boat with Pi. The part I did not like is when the animals were fighting each other. It's too hard to watch the survival of the fittest.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is so great. Suraj show a lot of emotions with his eyes and he stays in character and the audience can feel his emotions. It's so amazing to see his weight loss as the days go by at sea. My favorite character is Richard Parker. He helps Pi survive the shipwreck and at times he seems more human than creature. The lesson in this movie is anything is possible. Pi survives over seven months in the Pacific Ocean with just faith and Richard Parker.<br />I rank this movie 4 out of 5 stars. I give this age range 8 and up. Cheyenne N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />This is truly an amazing story, with a great adventure that is hard to believe. Pi, (Suraj Sharma) an Indian boy, is on a ship with his family who is moving to Canada. One night there is a terrible storm that sinks the ship and only Pi, a Hyena, Zebra, Orangutan and a Bengal Tiger whose name is Richard Parker survive. They are all in one of the small life boats trying to stay alive. After a while it only becomes Pi and Richard Parker who are adrift in the Pacific Ocean. Pi is now trying to survive, but is in fear of Richard Parker.<br /><br />Based on the best-selling novel by Yann Martel, this adventure is created in 3D and is one of my new favorites. The visual effects are amazing and capture the marine life really well with all its beautiful colors. I like the way this film is set up like someone is telling it as a story, this really keeps my attention. One of my favorite scenes is when a big whale comes out of the ocean; it is so big and pretty to see. It is incredible. I also like the way we learn how the Tiger is named Richard Parker. It is somewhat funny and unusual.<br /><br />I would love to know How Director, Ang Lee, directs all the animals in this film, it is truly amazing how they act. David Magee, (Screenplay writer) is doing a remarkable job on transforming a great novel into an amazing script. Other casts in Life of Pi include Vibish Sivakumar (Ravi Patel) and Rafe Spall (The Writer).<br /><br />A big message I found is to never lose hope no matter where you are in life. Pi is in the middle of the ocean for many many days with a big storm, and a Tiger, but through it all he never loses hope to be rescued. I recommend this film for ages 8 to adults. Younger ages may be a little frightened when they see some of the animal scenes, but other than that, this is a must see. You can enjoy it with your family and friends. I give Life of Pi 5 out of 5 stars. I love the message and the visual effects. This is a great story of hope and determination. Believe the unbelievable and see the amazing adventure in Life of Pi,it triumphs into theaters on November 21. by Brianna H, KIDS FIRST!

B0093LINVK|5.0|It arrived in a surprisingly small package since the device is so small. When you open the box you hear the Intel jingle. Four slots inside the 4-inch by 4-inch device, two for DRAM, one for wifi card, one for mSATA SSD drive.  I took the DRAM and wifi card out of older laptops, and ordered a 256GB mSATA drive from Amazon. But while waiting for the drive to arrive I used an external USB boot drive of Windows 8 To Go to hook up the NUoC to my flat screen television, and was booted up in Windows 8 in a matter of minutes. The 4-thread Ivy Bridge Core i5 processor at 1.8 GHz this delivers roughly 4 to 5 times the performance of a comparable Atom settop box or netbook or about the same as any current Sandy Bridge or Ivy Bridge based laptop or Core i5 desktop.  3 USB ports allowed me to hook up wireless keyboard and mouse in the back, and the front port I use for thumb drives.  Awesome little device!
B0038M2RL2|5.0|Do you enjoy rooting for the likable underdog as much as I do? Well then, this classic film is for you. This classic film from 1984, follows a young teen, Daniel (Ralph Macchio) whose life is already in turmoil due to a life changing move cross country. Now in California, Daniel tries to fit in, but has difficulties doing so and he has to talk his way out of a few fights. His luck finally runs dry and one night he is chased home and as he is being beaten up, someone comes to his defense and saves him. He wakes up later that night to find out his savior is none other than his apartment buildings' aging gardener, Miyagi (Pat Morita) but how could this little old man have taken on all the bullies? And can this man help Daniel turn things around and defend himself and his honor? Watch as these two become student and teacher not only build a lasting friendship, but help each other get through some trying times in their lives.<br /><br />My favorite character is Miyagi, because you don't expect this little, old man to be able to not old defend himself, but beat up a lot of bullies along the way. Plus, he is so funny in how he trains Daniel and just his overall personality. My favorite scenes are the training scenes, where Miyagi uses basic household chores to train Daniel, which confuses him. These are funny scenes, but at the same time, it is great how they will eventually tie in the training concepts with Daniel. This is a great example of someone who needs to prove to themselves and others that they have a great deal of inner strength. The storyline of this movie is phenomenal and there is a great amount of action in it as well. The cast does a great job and really give great performances that make them seem so believable.<br /><br />This is a fantastic family film and even though it's almost 30 years old, the story still holds strong today. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars as it is a movie the entire family will truly enjoy and can watch together. I recommend this film for the entire family.  Julianna N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.lm for the entire family.  Julianna N, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

B009POCG5Y|5.0|I thought this movie was great and funny. It was kind of like an older movie meant for older audiences but I still thought it was great. This movie is about a man named Gus who is a baseball talent scout but he is losing his sight. He is old-fashioned and always relied on his sight and a feeling to pick good baseball players. Without his sight he doesn't know how to scout and even though he is having trouble he won't ask for help. His daughter comes to help him anyway and they have a good time together but bad things happen too. The main characters in the movie are Gus and Mickey. Gus is played by Clint Eastwood and Mickey is played by Amy Adams. Amy Adams is in another movie that my little sister loves called Enchanted and I also really liked her in The Muppets. My favorite character in this movie is Gus because he is a good man that people should trust. He knows a LOT about baseball and has a good heart. The movie also has really good chemistry. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams work very well together. He kind of seems like a grumpy old man and she is kind of sweet.<br /><br />My favorite part in this movie is when Mickey meets a new guy who can through a really good curve ball and since she really loves baseball they become really good friends. I would recommend this movie for ages 10 and up because my brother says that the movie was a little too old for him and he's seven. The movie also has some inappropriate language and situations that are too young for kids under 10. Anthony A, KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.<br /><br />Video review available at kidsfirst dot org
B00AHSINKO|2.0|With the leading actors and potential story line, I thought it would be a bit more &#34;quipy&#34; and entertaining. Instead--it was lots of whining between the spouses, a predictable &#34;stick in the mud&#34; husband, and mediocre dialogue. In a word...Underwhelming.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was a good page-turner and I was sad to read the last page. There were so many twists and turns I was constantly surprised. The only thing lacking is dinosaurs and ninja robots.<br /><br />I was very entertained, but I can't say this is the best of the series.
B008NW67E0|5.0|These guys are pretty spectacular.  Can listen to this album on a continuous loop.  Great price, fast shipping and am completely satisfied with the product.
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I enjoyed the comic very much and this movie is fairly faithful to the source.<br /><br />Amazon's streaming service was excellent.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to read the final book. Not only was it hot and heavy, it has such an intriguing plot.
B009FZFONO|5.0|A Zombie soap, I like it. After all I did purchase the entire season, I think you will like to.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I found this game verry intertaining to pass the time. They could make more prizes pop up on the screen so you can collect more.
0425263908|4.0|I was hooked on Fifty Shades and finished the series.  I thought I would go ahead and give this a shot but wasn't too hopeful it would keep me as hooked as Fifty Shades did.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  Take the chance, I think you will be happy you did!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|this game is awesome. for those who haven't got it I recommend you get it. its really fun. much better than most free apps. my opinion this game is the best free game ever
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app! Especially for my kindle it's awesome. It's repetitive snooze and alarm works for when I don't wanna get up but it keeps going till I do! Soo I won't be late ^&middot;^ u can even costume it to make the alarm music or some recording of your mom yelling at you to wake. Lol,  u should get this.. especially if your a lazy person like me lol xp
B0086700CM|3.0|I was exited when temple run came to amazon but after a few plays and unlocked everything..... BORING sorry my spelling sucks! :(
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I thought that the movie was very well done, it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the film
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great box set.  The Price cant be beat for all three great movies! I remember when Blu-rays were still $25 to $30 per disc!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Nice game for little one..my girls love it.very easy to put on tablet and to play.i recomend this game to all parents who kids love hello kitty................
0984074422|5.0|Magnificent condition, fast delivery and many number of great photos with interesting articles attached. It amazes me how different human cultures are.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This game is really fun until those stupid ads pop up in the middle of the level. Come on Rovio limit the ads to after the gameplay.
B00139W3NE|4.0|This was a fun movie to watch if one is a fan of this kind of story.  I loved the books and the story line of the movie was close.
1400067820|2.0|VERY AWKWARD NEOLOGISM AND TOO MANY CATEGORIAL ASIDES THAT SHOW HIM TO BE A WISEGUY RATHER THAN A DEEP THINKER.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I was hoping this wasn't the end of the series.  But it was and I needed to get this series since I read all the books that this show is based on.  Cheesy but I love it.
B008KE3960|3.0|The premise of the game was great but more control was needed over the aircraft. They moved too slow. If they could improve the plane manuevering it would be a great app.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter is the best!!!  I recommend this show to all who have read the books and have seen all the other shows.
B006M6NV0M|5.0|Just the actors alone put this movie over the top. The action is almost non-stop. You'll find yourself yelling &#34;yeah&#34; and &#34;kick his butt&#34; alot while watching this. You can't go wrong with this one.
B00003CXDD|4.0|Willow is a very family type show.  The character Willow is very nurturing and cares a lot for the baby.  I like the story a lot.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This move is wonderful! The little girl is even cuter that Natalie Woods was when she did the film (the original). All the actors do a superb job, and who doesn't like Dylan McDermott? This is a must watch movie just like &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;. This movie gives me joy and hope for a wonderful Christmas. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be happy for the holidays!
630469654X|4.0|Love watching Matthew Broderick as a young pick-pocket.  He was very good as that character.  The story line is good.  I enjoyed it a lot.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|we all loved it, can hardly wait to see the rest of the series. hope that there is more than just one more to it!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I love watch this series.  I was hooked when I started watching this show on TV and couldn't get enough.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|There's plenty of brogue as the heroine struggles to come to grips with how to be a prim and proper Princess when all she wants to be is a warrior with outstanding bow skills.  It is true to how a teen must break away from their parents' and sometimes society's expectations to discover themselves.  It also shows how you can rebel and still meet everyone's expectations, even your own by being true to yourself.  There is family conflict, teen-age angst, personal growth, loss, love and reunion.  It's a Disney classic... and I love those!  Sit back and enjoy a great story, a great moral and lots of flying orange hair!  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
B001LF347E|5.0|I love Merlin from the first time I saw it on TV.  It's fast paced and the actors are very good, especially Colin Morgan.  Love it!
B000I186FW|4.0|Lots of action and an intense plot.  I liked it a lot and my 16-year-old son LOVES it.  It lead us into a whole discussion of Guy Fawkes and why it's relevant today.  We spent some time researching it.  When a movie leaves you (and your teenager) with that kind of curiosity, it's a good movie.  I was worried it would be too maudlin super-hero, but it wasn't.  It was anti-hero/heroine.  It has stayed with me and informed me in ways few other movies have.  I have watched it several times since our initial viewing and my son recommends it to everyone.  And Natalie Portman is fantastic!
B000NA28I4|3.0|I was hoping to watch an Eragon movie that was close to the book.  I'm hoping a second movie about the second book will be out in the future.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|This movie is witty, touching, poignant and overall fantastic.  I didn't think it would be, but I am an avid Steve Martin fan.  He is not silly or goofy (like The Jerk), he isn't oafish (like Rupricht or All Of Me), he is mature and human and funny (like Planes, Trains And Automobiles).  All the acting is really good.  You feel for all of them.  You buy into their competition and how central it is to their characters' lives.  Well written, directed and edited.  A feel good movie to share with your family!  Wonderful.
B008EQIA7W|4.0|I watched the clash of the titans with huge hopes and I have to say it disappointed me quite a bit. However the sequel was much better in almost all aspect. It might not have been the best movie but it was well worth my time watching it.
B000IKQMFO|3.0|It is similar in it's tone and pace, but I still love Downton Abbey much more.  This is really good, but I had high expectations being such a Downton Abbey fan, and it just didn't quite live up to them.  It isn't as absorbing.  I just didn't care as much about the relationships between the characters.  If you love the time period and the author, watch it.  If you want something just as wonderful as Downton, watch those again instead.  It would be good for a cold/rainy/snowy indoor kind of day.
B002KT3XH6|4.0|Very very enjoyable and I really learned something.  Fascinating women, all.  I knock off one star because I wished there were more pictures or images of the people and places- I ended up googling images on my own.  The writer refers to several images that are not in the book and it was kind of frustrating.  Also in the Kindle version you have no idea which page to go to for photos.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Between the sultry voice of Antonio Banderas and the cuteness of Puss, how could this go wrong.  I really enjoyed watching it with my kids.  We all laughed and had a good time.  Nice plot and the humor didn't disappoint.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|this game is awesome. it's somuch fun and get caught up in. I think one cheats if they buy extra rolls and uses more than two on ccertain column....my thoughts on it. I just use rolls already given but thatcould just be me. it's like yahtzee and fun. app works good for me and no problems. sometimes I need to sign into my Amazon app again aand again..not this app though. I love it :-).
B009JBZH54|5.0|Fast shipping and product was better than described! Ended up getting the collectors edition, an thought we were getting just the blu ray edition.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app, it keeps me updated on items I have an interest in and I am finding more uses for it all the time.
0547848412|5.0|I was expecting a used book -- because that is what I purchased. The book came and it's condition is perfect, from what I can see. I cannot write the review of this product based on the content of the book, because I have yet to finish it... But I have started it and I am hooked. Great product and shipped and delivered within the projected time frame.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This is a great app, I use on my phone to check on files I have. Has FTP and that is the main reason I got it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this is a simple breeding and growing game and if you enjoy the challenge of trying to discover new breeds and leveling up then its for you.  one of its coolest features is you can be sent gold by friends instead of needing to pay for it.  also the food for the dragons never goes bad so you don't have to worry about getting back to it all the time.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|VERY FUN! my kids like to play this as well as watch eachother play this. they like to create their own stickmen! worth the $1
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is simple and mindless fun!  a great game to do when your bored and when you have something you don't want to do:P
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Loved this movie. Lots of actions and special effects! It finally goes full circle. Can't wait to see what is next
B00992CF6W|2.0|I will build stuff then exit and come back my stuff will be gone<br />it would be a good game if it would save my stuff
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I really enjoyed the Harry Potter series and now want to bring the full blu-ray versions into my collection.  If you like HP and have a blu-ray player, GET IT!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Worked nicely on kindle fire. Zoom worked with usual method enlarging screen. Would suggest it for kids. .similar to Harry Potter story
B009A9EQL6|5.0|I put 5 stars caus' I love it.<br />Songs are beautiful; there is a bunch of styles in this album.<br />The love songs Aerosmith love to do (3),<br />the single ( much more violent) , equivalent to eat the rich or love in teh elevator,<br />and a lot of bluesy rnr tunes. Every kinds of fans of Aerosmith will like it.<br /><br />What could have been better, much more punchy songs.<br />Anyway, I listen to it for one month and I still love it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|All i can say is each book ends up surpassing the previous one.  I cannot wait until the next one!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is great when I need to do my algebra home work so it dosent take as long love it
B008VBYN80|4.0|Good game so far, especially if you only play for a few minutes at a time.  I have played for about two hours and plan to continue.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|We all  are slaves to time itself during the seasons of our lives. Whether wanting the calender to speed up, or an weekend to last forever...<br />You will enjoy the reflection this book will stir up within you. Mitch is a great story teller, and the most important story you will ever have is the story you tell yourself about your own life! I highly recommend this book.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|You just never know what is going to happen next.  Or what the author will come up with next.  However the twist at the end make it all worth it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Hmmm... might have missed the point. Have to read again. Overall it was a very cool book. Charlie is just really weird.

0810970686|5.0|Greg Heffley tells about his life in a journal of sorts. His story skips between his lives at home with his family and his rough days at school. At home his father tries to make him tough. But he is very clever, changes his fathers mind so he won't have to join military school. At school Greg gets bullied and humiliated on a daily bases, from wedgies to being made fun of because he wrote a letter to the prettiest girl in his class.<br /><br />Jeff Kinney (the author) demonstrates what Greg; his family and friends look like along with the events that happen to Greg threw his illustrations. I believe children and adults alike will have no trouble relating to Greg and his life because at some point in their live every one has an experience or knows some one who has had a similar experience in their lives. My son began reading Jeff Kinney's books when he was nine and still likes them a two years later. The movie's also help bring the characters to life and my children loved them as well.

0545123291|3.0|Linger is book two of Maggie Stiefvater's Wolves of Mercy Falls. Once Grace and Sam have found each other, they must fight to stay together. For Sam, this means a reckoning with his werewolf past. For Grace, it means facing a future that is less and less certain. A strange illness awakens within her, depleting her body and leaving her weakened and afraid. As she slowly deteriorates, Sam who's been ordered to stay away from her after being discovered in her room one night worries he's about to lose the only girl he has ever cherished. Linger opens up Sam and Grace's world to include Cole and Isabel as narrators, and divulges even more about the wolves and how they live. Sam is still trying to get used to the fact that he is fully human and has a future ahead of him. Grace is feeling the strain of keeping secrets from her parents and Sam as well as her irritation with her parents' constant absences. Sharp-tongued Isabel suffers from remorse at her part in her brother's death, and even though she'd like to stay away from the wolves, she can't help but be drawn to Cole, a sardonic boy who chose to be a wolf to escape the problems in his human life, but is finding that being a wolf is in reality making him confront the things he has tried to bury. Finally Cole realizes that Grace needs to be re-infected with wolf poison to save her life. Will Grace become wolf or suffer her ill fate?<br /><br />This book was a little confusing because it skips back and forth from all four of the characters. The cover was very interesting and had some appeal that made me want to read it. The first part of the story though drags a bit. But once you get into it, it's not that bad. It is best to read from the first of the series called Shiver.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about. I just picked it based on reviews. I loved the way the author described everything. I had no problem visualizing everything as it happened. The story is great and I look forward to reading more.........
B007PP2J9I|5.0|I'm really baffled that a guy like Mark Russinovich is this person of extrem techinical depth and also can put together a really entrancing story. I could not put the  book down!<br /><br />My tip, read Zero Day first it gives a little more context,
B007HO392S|5.0|I love Carrie Underwood but she out-did herself on this CD.  Blown Away is the best song I have heard in many years from the Country Scene.  She is and will continue to be a top star.
B005LAII12|1.0|I really wanted to go and see this movie cause it looked funny, I mean come on a talking bear! But really Seth this movie didn't even make me giggle it only made me smile. This movie had very poor humor and went a little to far like are you serious a bear and a girl having sex like come on.<br /><br />Plot<br />The plot was that Ted and main character were childhood friends and then they get older and he is in love with his girlfriend and it was the whole me or the bear thing. Yawn. Then the bear is kiddnapped by a man and a boy who wanted to buy Ted so that his son could have a friend. Yawn.<br /><br />If you really wanna see it I would highly suggest you rent it ! I sat there wanting to go to sleep cause I have seen this plot like a thousand times it was a really bad movie that I felt embarrassed about wanting to go see it.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very easy to use. Once you click the icon, it will open very fast and not lagging at all. Very useful application.
B000059XUT|5.0|Toy story is a classic kids movie that adults enjoy watching as well. I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It's an okay game. Just gets kind of boring with a lot of repetition and takes a while to get coins to go further. I don't hate it or mind playing it when I am extremely bored.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|I'm a classic guitarist who's long thought that these 6 sonata/partitas work fully as well on my instrument as on the violin, but with the first few measures of Sonata I's Adagio (track 1), I found my confidence shaken. There's no question that a classic guitar handles the polyphony better, but the soaring, singing, arcing, whispering line that Kremer throws out is a very strong argument for the notiont that these pieces belong on a violin, or at least must be played on both instruments to get at most of the music.<br /><br />THIS is the way I want a violin to sound. That it's recorded in two wonderfully resonant churches certainly helps (a wise choice as it helps the multiple lines hang in the air a bit longer). The heart of it, though, is that this is a gorgeous instrument, played with all the heart Kremer can muster - and that's a truckload. His tempi are alternately slower and faster than I'd expected, but always right for his reading. This is a musician's musician, and his confidence is towering.<br /><br />Finally, there's his concept of the pieces. He get all the little details but contains them in a much larger structure. Hearing him play, I encountered the pieces anew, hearing quite clearly the meta-structure Kremer sees in them in a way that seems grounded and convincing. His reading of the Sonata I's fugue makes it clear why Bach loved this composition enough to use it in three different settings - this one for violin, BWV 1000 (lute), and BWV 539 (organ). Personally, I'd consider it second only to the Chaconne (Partita II), which many have suggested is his most profound composition.<br /><br />I have a number of other records of these pieces, and have loved them all, but I had to keep only one, it would be this one. A magnificent achievement!
B009D7CP2M|2.0|I forced myself to finish this book because our book club was scheduled to discuss it.  I was ready to give up about half way through.  Nobody in our group liked the book, but we did have an interesting discussion.  There are lots of general topics that it provokes one to discuss--like 'nature vs. nurture' or gun control.  My view, and that of others was that the characters were all overdrawn--the coldest mother, the dorkiest father, the most evil son and the perfect angel daughter.  Each was 'over the top'.  But by far, what was hardest to accept was the over the top writing.  I always appreciate a good vocabulary, but in this book the writer consistently would reach for a more obscure adjective and then pile 2 or 3 more on for good measure.  I imagine this would stop some readers in their tracks.  And, sadly, it's not that she isn't a good writer, because she can certainly craft a good sentence.  It's just constantly over-written and feels as if she worked very hard to make it so.<br /><br />The book was very disturbing, as it was intended to be, so a word of warning.  Don't read it just before bed. It will haunt you!  For that reason I couldn't recommend it to anyone, to be honest. One of our group members gave up on the book and watched the movie instead, which she reported to be pretty good.<br /><br />I would not give it any stars, but it's obvious that this writer has talent and the book is provocative.
B000H4QD1O|4.0|I did not expect much of a series that was cancelled after just one season, but it was free and I was in the mood for SciFi, so... I was positively surprised. The Western SciFi mix requires you to suspend your disbelief a bit, but after that, the characters are unusual, funny, and the story is interesting. I would have watched it for more than one season.
B0079R8IYW|3.0|Should he complain I'l buy him a lump of coal for christmas. I can't anything good or bad.so good luck.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is fun and creepy. Totally worth the $2.99 that I paid for it. I'm keeping an eye out for other games from this publisher.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|My daughter is a Hayao Miyazaki fan.  She loves his work, his artistry, his storytelling, his characters.  The covers and descriptions always seem like &#34;girl movies,&#34; but the boys come and watch them when they're on too.  She brought one with her to sleepover at a friend's house and the brothers started to leave the room when the movie came on.  They sat there for the entire movie, shocked and thrilled!
B000N0W9WO|5.0|great Holiday movie. I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to anybody wanting a feel good movie Cheers to all
B005NFW0U0|5.0|Great series. I became obsessed with it and still am. So yeah I'm totally team Damon that's for sure ;)
B009VB97EY|3.0|Not the best movie but something to do to burn a couple hours, the plot lacked a lot had some funny lines but don't expect to much.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Well honestly I loved that it had action. I had been wanting to see it forever and finally got to see it and it wasnt the best, but I enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Amazing book, would recommend to anyone to read. I've getting lost in my readings especially with a book like this!!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was an okay movie and plus it had Johnny Depp! I guess I was just expecting a little bit more comedy is all.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|On a kindle Fire,  much needed app quick and easy access tot he program.  Get it!  The price is right.  Drawback is.........as is with all apps, the permissions.

0613824229|4.0|This is an outstanding book - suitable for adolescents through adults.<br />I was disappointed in the binding, paper quality, and type. I paid extra for the &#34;School and Library Binding&#34;, thinking it would be of better quality. That was not the case. Next time I'll just order the regular paperback.
B0011E9LBI|5.0|The original Men in Black fits right into the well-developed genre of &#34;good guys rule&#34; 90's action movies.  If you love 'em, you love 'em.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Not what I was expecting, as usual this movie doesn't live up to the high standards set by the book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Definitely worth it if you own a 3D TV.... AT home 3D is way better then the movie theater 3D any day....
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This is a great book about Navy Seals and what they go through.  Another Great book is Chris Kyle Navy Seal sniper.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|Seen it in 2D and I love the movie.... Good Story and Graphics... So I bought it in 3D thinking it would be right along the lines of The Avengers in 3D, and needless to say I was not impressed with the 3D graphics of this movie.... I think there's not enough jump out at you 3D scenes...
B005LCECU6|5.0|Totally give this very early RUSH recording 5 stars!! As already reviewed and mentioned by others - the sound quality is very good for way back in '74, and one can really hear the early foundations of RUSH cranking out and and in your face on every song. As is the case for most us RUSH die-hards in our 30 and 40 somethings ... the earliest collection of live recordings we likely know are from  'All The Worlds A Stage' of 1976 - which in many ways remains my favorite of all live RUSH to this day! The raw energy, stripped down sound of the guitar, bass and mega drums that makes 'All The World' so awesome to hear are clearly showcased and very present in this evolving RUSH of some two years prior.<br />The entire album ROCKS from start to finish!! ... with Here Again, Fancy Dancer, In The Mood and a smoking version of Working Man as my favs. Another cool aspect too, and one which really lends a vintage tone and feel to it all ... is the hum of the amps and Alex doing little 'strums' and tuning between songs while Geddy talks to the crowd ... I mean WAY COOL!! The CD is a definite 'must have' to any RUSH collection!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|The Soundfly FM Transmitter is everything it's advertised to be.In fact you can almost say the unit is a plug and play hassle free product. After using this player for the first week I came to terms that I needed to purchase another one for my wife.After all, why pay for radio when this player sounds like a professional station without commercials. the only down side I have to offer is that every time you you start your car the player will come on as well, and thats even after you turn off the player manually.You will find many other review and probley read the same things that I have wrote, but after all this is how I made my decision to spend a little more for a transmitter that not only plays my MP3 player songs and USB stored music (memory stick). it also excepts compact flash as well. In all...I'm happy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Me encanto esta historia, al igual q la anterior. La personalidad de la protagonista y el valor de Crossfire, lo q hizo por salvarla me impresiono. La recomiendo, sin duda.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Completely predictable! You really only need to read half of the book to know what happens, but the plot is good. However, it was lacking action/suspense and could have been a little long.
B00005214X|4.0|I got this a Christmas present last year. George was my favorite Beatle, a great guitarist, and his writing was just as good as John and Paul. But as a solo artist, he was far better than the rest. His songs are beautiful and the guitar playing is so smooth. And he is one of the few artists whose slide guitar playing I like. All Things Must Pass is all the Beatles-era music that George didn't get to release. The music is incredible, and so soothing to listen to. Beware of darkness is magical, Bob Dylan's If Not For You is one of favorites, great lyrics, and George's singing is much better than Dylan's.<br /><br />The problem I have with this album is the production. Phil Spector was a great producer, but as time went on, he expanded his wall of sound until it just got ridiculously loud. In my opinion, he ruined the music on Let It Be, but Geogre needed a producer and he was available. The songs Wah-Wah, What Is Life, Let It Down, Isn't It A Pity, and Awaiting on You All (to name a few) are great songs, but it just sounds like a loud mesh of echo-y sounds. This could have been one of the best albums of all time if only it was produced better.
B0058YPILY|5.0|I have watched all of the other season, and I own them all, too!  I find this to be a good show.
0062101897|5.0|This book was bought as a Christmas gift.  She had actually requested it as a gift so I am sure she will love it.

B000FC10WU|5.0|I enjoy all Agatha Christie books, especially Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot. This particular book was particularly good in showing how Miss Marple makes connections others miss. I didn't figured out who the killer was until the very end. Will look for another book of hers soon.
B00006JIA4|4.0|Got the CD's on the day it was promised. Love using Prime....... my son in law will be very happy with this gift.
B000W91RUG|5.0|As title says, I can´t stop watching. I watched all episodes at once and went straight to season 2 and I´m not stopping there either.<br /><br />This show is extremely funny and also very heartwarming. Actors are very good, great characters, extremely well written, and all in all a must see if you ask me.<br /><br />A lot of people I know don´t watch this because it is as they say: &#34;A bunch of nerds talking about nerdy stuff&#34;. That is true, but it is done in a very humorous and intelligent way. I believe the characters, and I understand the world they are living in to the fullest. Just to clearify, you  won´t need to read up on physics or science to understand the show.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Book started a bit unbelievable, but the story grew and was most entertaining.  Always good reading<br />when there is a believable &#34;hero&#34;.<br /><br />The Litigators
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A modern family classic. My 3 year old loves this movie. It brings back memories about when Christmas and Santa were still so real.

B001Y8WAJQ|4.0|I've been a Saxon fan - really the first seven albums - since about 1981. It is refreshing to listen to vocals and music that retain the realism of music that hasn't been polished to the point of unrecognizability. I was thrilled to find CD replacements for my vinyl and cassettes. (Those were the things on which old-timers listened to music, they weren't even digital).<br /><br />Saxon's 4th album, &#34;Denim & Leather&#34;, came out in 1981.  The song &#34;Denim and Leather&#34; received quite a bit of air time on the radio stations back then.  It seems to be the only song that a lot of aging metal-heads remember from Saxon.  The rest of the album is pretty good too.  &#34;Denim & Leather&#34; comes in at #4 on my Saxon top 7.
B003YV64OI|5.0|Multitasks easy, handles higher end gaming surprisingly well, still needed more power so I got the FX 8350 (actually writing reviews while I wait for it in a few hours). For it's price, it is exceptional. Managed to get it to 3.8GHz by putting bus to 240. Still stayed below 40C with my cooling system (H100 with only one fan, and 6 chassis)<br /><br />If you need a simple upgrade and you have Socket AM2+, AM3, or AM3+, get it now

They've each been replaced 3 or 4 times over the years.  If I had to pick two Saxon albums that showcased their early '80's hard rock sound, these would be the two that I would choose.  Power & the Glory edges out Strong Arm of the Law most of the time, but only just.  \\"Power & the Glory\\" and \\"Strong Arm of the Law\\" rank numbers 1 & 2 on my Saxon top 7 albums list.<br /><br />As I've said before about Saxon, their music is meant to be listened to at high volumes with the windows rolled down.

0307719219|2.0|Despite the credentials of the authors and the acclaim that this book has received from a who's who of economists, it fails to live up to the hype. Acemoglu and Robinson offer an institutional theory of economic development aimed at general (non-specialist) readers. In their attempt to make their account widely accessible, however, the authors sacrifice too much rigor.<br /><br />Briefly, the authors' argument is that prosperity or poverty result from differences in economic and political institutions, with \\"inclusive\\" institutions producing prosperity and \\"extractive\\" institutions impeding development. Under extractive institutions, political leaders resist innovation and the creative destruction that it entails because it will threaten their power and privileged economic position. While growth under extractive institutions is possible, it is not sustainable, because such institutions \\"do not foster creative destruction and generate at best only a limited amount of technological progress\\" (150), and because such institutions generate political conflict over control of the state. The authors also try to explain institutional differences by pointing to critical junctures (major events such as the Black Death) that sent areas with slight initial institutional differences down different historical paths. Insofar as it goes, there is nothing too innovative about the core of the argument: institutions like functioning states and markets are conducive to development, while their absence is not.<br /><br />Acemoglu and Robinson support their argument with brief historical narratives (anecdotes really) - and lots of them. For example, one chapter discusses Uzbekistan, North Korea, Argentina, Colombia, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, and Egypt. Not surprisingly, the authors find that their monocausal theory explains economic development or stagnation in every case.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book has several crippling shortcomings. First, the authors never clearly define their central concept: institutions. Nor do they provide a comprehensive list of institutions that qualify as inclusive or extractive. Instead, it is left to the reader to conclude that inclusive economic institutions consist largely of property rights, while extractive institutions include slavery, monopoly, and barriers to market entry. Inclusive political institutions include democracy (or some semblance of pluralism), the rule of law, and a functioning state (or a minimal measure of political centralization), while extractive institutions include absolutist regimes. Second, with their main concepts left undefined or defined only vaguely, the authors offer no clear way of measuring how inclusive or extractive a given country's institutions are. Instead, brief narratives on a large number of cases are intended to show that successful countries have \\"more\\" inclusive institutions, or \\"somewhat\\" inclusive institutions, or \\"some semblance of\\" inclusive institutions, etc. Third, the book attempts no rigorous hypothesis testing, and the authors dismiss alternative explanations (chapter 2) because they find them unable to explain all variation across countries. Rather than acknowledging that factors other than institutions also influence economic development, and attempting to weigh the relative influence of institutions vis-à-vis those factors, the authors opt for a strongly monocausal explanation. (On this point, see Jeffrey Sachs's review of the book in Foreign Affairs, September/October 2012).<br /><br />Besides these substantive shortcomings, there is also the authors' annoying habit of repeating the book's main claim on nearly every page of the book, which quickly becomes tedious. This takes away from what would otherwise be an enjoyable (if unsatisfying) read. Certainly the book contains some material that will be of interest to many readers. But Why Nations Fail doesn't live up to the hype of offering a compelling theory of development.
B00000JNOJ|5.0|Excellent tracks on this LP, and it really works as an album. You'll hear this from many people, but it's true: the sound quality is incredible! And not by 1964 standards, I mean by today's standards. Muddy Waters made great efforts in recording this. Based on that alone, people with all different tastes in music are going to enjoy Folk Singer. Great acoustic music and great sound by a Chicago Blues legend.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I really like understanding the characters better and actually the quirkiness of their personalities, of course the love scenes are too shabby either! Looking forward to the next book due to how this one leaves you hanging :)

B005LAIIQC|5.0|They did a very good job of explaining this character and moving on from Jason Bourne. The action is unbelievable!
B003FXXNH6|3.0|I liked the first movie the best with Wesley Snipes and Vin Rhimes. The second movie starred Michael Jai White, it had good fight scenes between Michael Jai White and Scott Akins. As for the third...I would recommend only renting it. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this one, unless you want to add to your Steven Seagal movie collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The first game I have played on this device and I am enjoying it.<br />Easy to play and plays smoothly.
B008QE9VJI|2.0|They missed the mark on this one.  The actors, the script and the sets were first rate but there was one aspect of the story that really sucked.  Very good, nice, decent people got killed by the vampire.  The vamp was the guy we were supposed to sympathize with.  He had a charming personality and somewhat of a morale compass.  Hollywood should have used their standard trick of having the vampire only kill bad people.
B0076DELIG|3.0|Being Dutch, I obviously have an immediate  affection for the protagonist in Michael Connely's Harry Bosch stories. I have devoured earlier publications. Connely's latest is yet another good and solid story with interesting characters, even though I found the plot to be a bit farfetched. What's the chance of being a rookie in 1992 finding a murder victim and to solve that cold case twenty years later, after having been involved in Danish, Iraqi and political intrications... all the time when your boss hates your guts? Hmmm... not sure.<br />But if you like an evening of uncomplicated reading, this is your book.
030759565X|5.0|Very good cookbook.  Good pictures of steps in recipes to follow.  Some different dishes to try. I would recommend it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Finally, John Grisham lets his protagonist win out in the end.  Even though Grisham like to think everyone in prison is innocent and a victim, this book held my attention in every chapter and took some unexpected turns.

0547884591|4.0|A fanatastic book about cooking, which has motivated me to try new things and hone my existing skills. For readers of Tim Ferriss' blog, there is almost nothing new in the book, but a lot of old ideas rehashed. The part on language learning is especially silly for people who intend to gain fluency.<br /><br />The book is hard to use if you live outside the US, amazon does not ship kitchen items internationally!<br /><br />Still, for anyone who cares about what they eat, the chapter \\"Domestic\\" is a must read, even for an advanced cook!
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Has always been one of my favorite but it's so good to share with friends and family.  A really warm and fuzz felling movie.  The Santa is beautiful and all the innocents is so welcoming.
B0059XTU22|4.0|In his return to Middle-Earth, eight years after his concluding installment in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Peter Jackson once again adapts a beloved Tolkien novel for the silver screen. In this prequel, the first of three films, we accompany a band of dwarves, along with an unwilling Bilbo Baggins, on their journey to reclaim their homeland.<br /><br />On it's own, An Unexpected Journey is a majestic and fantastical tale that will be sure to please audiences of all ages. The action is thrilling and the story is full of humor and light-heartedness. The cinematography is everything you would expect from a Jackson film; sweeping landscapes, elaborate set pieces, and an incredible sense of grandeur. The film is incredibly fun and is a welcome return to Middle-Earth. Martin Freeman is terrific as our little hero, and I'm incredibly glad he was cast in the role. Each returning cast member reprises their role masterfully, particularly Ian McKellen as Gandalf, and the new actors fit into their roles quite nicely.<br /><br />However, for me, compared with the Lord of the Rings saga, The Hobbit didn't quite meet the expectations I had. Perhaps they were already impossibly high because of my love for the Rings trilogy, but the film just didn't give me the sense of shock and awe I was hoping for. The film's pace drags a bit, especially the first forty minutes or so, but I can't criticize that too much as there's a lot of backstory to cover and a lot of characters to introduce. Also, the movie is incredibly CGI intensive; almost to the point that it took me out of the movie. I understand there was a lot of CGI in the Rings films but this just felt a little over the top.<br /><br />It was great to get reacquainted with some of the characters I've come to love, particularly Gandalf and especially Gollum, who's game of riddles scene with Bilbo is easily the best in the film. I'm not entirely sold on Jackson's persistence on making three films, as I think the story could have been told in two, but I'll continue to trust in him. It may be unfair to compare this film with the Lord of the Rings films, but the fact is we wouldn't have this movie if it weren't for the trilogy. Had The Hobbit been made before the Rings series, perhaps it would have blown me away more.n told in two, but I'll continue to trust in him.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|It's a very fun little prop, wonderful sound effects. The uv writing tip for hidden messages works like a charm.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it doesn't actually open doors. Doubly ineffective on wooden doors.
B004HW7JHE|5.0|So glad that you can get so many of your favorite series on Amazon. This one is for my son-in-law. I know he will love it.
B0013O123Q|1.0|too violent and difficut to follow.<br />only watched 1/2 the film, and had to shut it off at the rape scene.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I ordered this cd for my highly devoted daughter, the Directioner. She loves the lads! And honestly, so do I. Louis, Niall, Harry, Zayn & Liam. Yup, I know them all. Emily introduced me to the music awhile back & I gotta say, they're awesome. I actually have a reason to thank Simon for something lol. After Up All Night, I wasn't sure they could beat what most call \\"the sophomore curse.\\" But, they did. And how! 'Rock Me' is like some kind of anthem that begs to be blared at full volume. 'Kiss You' is sweet and cute and, like most of the songs, a little naughty, if you interpret the lyrics a certain way. 'Heart Attack' is awesome, especially due to Niall's \\"ow's\\" (you have too hear it to get get why though, obviously).  'Little Things' will make you cry. Those are just a few of my favorites. I got this cd for my daughter, but I would have bought it anyway, they're that entertaining. Enjoy!
B005LAIISA|2.0|The content has shfted from being more centered in the real world of the Ice Age, and has drawn far too much from recent culture: hip hop, teen angst current pop references and a gooey amount of emotional sugar poured over it. Gone are the arguments and vinager that made the first three more involving and funnier. The awareness that kids are going to be watching has made this entry more preachy, and ,and  three fingers in the throat for the adults watching. Only Scrat remains untouched. The science used here is nonsense, but far more accurate than Creationism.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is a movie that you can watch over and over again and not get tired of. It's a classic. Keira Knightly and the rest of the cast did a wonderful job.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|I had the bad sensation of reading the same book, just with light diferences between the first and this one.
B00006674X|5.0|I always liked the movie, and also Elvis Presley.  I also liked Mary Tyler Moore.  With all the requirements, I won't be rating anything else!
B003CBTVNG|5.0|this is a show the entire family has enjoyed for years and it is one we will come back in a few years and watch again...
B00008YJH5|3.0|I guess that I am not a fan.  While the music is interesting and rocks hard, I wasn't feeling it.  Maybe I am just getting too old to listen to this.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|This is a fun ap to play but I hate the updates.  The latest update was for 18 episodes but only a few were available. Then it would say available in 10 hours then available in 18 hours then in 2 days 14 hours.  I finally just gave up. Don't waste your time.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a wonderful tale full of vivid imagination and creation. Riggs may enhance this story with fanciful oddities for the characters, but there is no doubt that he understands the underlying pit-falls for those who are just that little bit different.<br />A great book for both adults and older children.
B000002LSV|5.0|I am recent convert over to ZZTop. This is a great driving CD, especially \\"Viva Las Vegas\\". Worth the price of the CD alone, go to You-Tube and see \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" by ZZ Top. You will be impressed.
0307891372|5.0|I purchased this book for my youngest son so he could complete the game. Book was in new condition, exactly as described.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I enjoyed re-reading this timeless book that helps me direct my life's work.The stories are also rich with detail and helped me implement the four agreements easily.
0061992860|5.0|This book has the info you need to survive in the wild both short term and long term. There was a lot of work and detail put into this that is worth infinitely more than the money it costs. Everyone should get this. Put it in your bunker. Put it in your bug out bag. Never go anywhere without this.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun and when something's on my mind that I need to sort through, this helps. Good left brain, right brain balancer.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|The movie came on time & im in love with the television series so I was happy you have them all .
B009VB97EY|3.0|This was an okay movie... Nothing like my fellow co-workers made it out to be. Channing is a great guy but no matter the content of the movie, if the plot line is bad, you can't win em all....
B00622B3MY|5.0|This movie is awesome. I've watched it over 20 times now. Excellent entertainment. Can't download and put on your phone (Sucks that I paid for it and should be able to put it on any platform I so choose, but can't).
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I definitely recommend this album.  Every song is wonderful and you will not be disappointed.  I've been playing this on my ipod wherever I go.  So get ready for a good listen!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|Picked this up for my wife. The movie is awesome. The girls are enjoyable to watch. The minions are funny. Great for any family to watch. Received the movie in decent time manner considering the holidays. Pick this up for your family. You will not be dissappointed.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|Love love love this album.  I have been listening it to for months and am still enjoying every song.  As always, Jason's songs are thoughtful and touching.  After every listening, I am immediately in a better mood.
1572810408|5.0|I had been looking for a tarot deck after I lost my Nigel Jackson deck which I loved. I like this one better! The drawings are great and the Christian symbols are not too obvious. Love the medieval feel. Nice, soft colors.
0451232852|5.0|I was very pleased with the product quality. It came promptly which was nice. I have no complaints. Very good
B007N9FKCY|1.0|The constant bouncing makes your &quot;bean&quot; very difficult to control.  All you can do is move left or right.  Graphics are cute but that's about it.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Hidden objects not to difficult to find. Timed game is fun. For those that complained there wasn't enough time go into options and turn timer off duh!! And why complain that some objects are to hard to find that's the object of the game. Try children hidden objects if this is to tough.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I've never been good at jig-saw puzzles, but this app is fun and I'm g3tting better every day.  I like having different levels of the same picture. It's a very user-friendly app, with vivid pics, great color. A few things could work better -- sometimes the pieces are sticky when trying to move them from the tray. When I select for the straight-edge pieces, others are mixed in.
B007UWBQEU|3.0|we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I was put on to this book from a friend. I'm not married but she knows of the issues I was  having  with my boyfriend and she suggested I read it. This ha  opened my eyes so much. I loved that it was able to help me learn what I wanted in a relationship an  what my boyfriend wanted. It also made me think of my parents, I am planning on buying the book for them go put a spark in their marriage.

B000VT6FAO|5.0|I am a long time fan of Depeche Mode. David Gahan has proven that he has a natural talent as a singer/song writer. You can tell he puts his heart and soul into every song. If you are a true fan I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another great chapter in the Scarpetta legacy. Couldn't put it down and can't wait for the next exciting adventure for the whole team.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Works great!!!<br />Works as advertised a very useful app for battery use with some added things like a graph. And battery temp.
B0025KW29U|5.0|This is one of the few things I would recommend everyone watching and watching again. I have showed it to more then 1 person who had never heard of it. First scene response is either rolling eyes or laughing that it is silly. As soon as NPH's first song hits there are no more negative reactions. Plus it only gets better the more you watch it.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises(2012) is a solid Batman movie. It's the third installment in the Christopher Nolan Batman film series. Batman(Christian Bale) and Catwoman(Anne Hathaway) have to stop Bane(Tom Hardy) from destroying Gotham City with a nuclear weapon. Batman, Jim Gordon and Gotham City are still suffering from the damage The Joker caused in The Dark Knight(2008). The tone of The Dark Knight Rises is dark and depressing, but the pacing is very fast. The film borrows story material from the Knightfall comic book. Hans Zimmer composed a loud, tribal, energetic music score for the film. The action scenes are thrilling. Batman uses an aircraft called \\"The Bat\\". People complained about Bane's \\"garbled, Sean Connery voice\\".<br />The terrorist attack at the football game felt like Two Minute Warning(1976) or Black Sunday(1977). There's a sight gag with a football player turning his head to see a giant hole in the stadium. There was the real life, tragic, midnight screening of The Dark Knight Rises in the Summer of 2012. Several people were killed and dozens more were injured by a gunman. These innocent people were just trying to watch a Batman movie. Officer Blake is one of the more heroic and humane characters in the story. Anne Hathaway was very good as Catwoman. In the film, she's simply called \\"Selina Kyle\\". Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson co-star. The Dark Knight Rises was a good finale to the rebooted Batman movies.
B0000931QA|5.0|Yes, the themes are juvenile. I loved this album as an angry young buck and it is still a lot of fun today. The themes resonate especially well during election seasons. Good mastering, good music, this is a classic concept album that I encourage anyone to give a listen. It's even great for long car rides with people who don't like books on tape: they get music and you get an hour long emotional tale of a young man fighting for what he was told was justice. Huzzah.
B00AH34AUQ|5.0|Without a doubt this has been quite a ride for the boys releasing three albums in a span of four months but the wait was worth it. Tre is most definitely the best out of the three albums in the series. Although each album has a distinct life on its own, Tre seems to blow the other two away. There is not one bad song on the album and I could listen to it over and over again. A quick note to all the haters who are posting on here with their negative reviews, it is obvious that the comments you are writing are for your own hatred of the band, but there is nothing to hate about this last effort, so please get off the negative crap about these albums, and enjoy them for what they truly are, good rock and roll music. I love all three in the series. Good work boys!!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoy the John Grisham novels. There always is a surprise ending that is unxepected. The Racketeer is just such a book. It kept me reading long past my bedtime. Then I was sorry I finished it so soon. Good book and I recommend it .
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love this game. I like finding the items and helping to solve the puzzle. it's a great game for free. One of the better quality games. Thanks Amazon!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! it was excellent! everytime i thought i knew what was going to happen it took another turn. I loved it!
B004OR199G|4.0|I actually am trying to change my eating habits based on the information in the book- but it's more of a crazy, intense diet and not a whole lot of sexy as far as I am concerned. I do salute the author, though, for taking the time to share her story with the world. Changing to a plant-based diet can and will do all of the things that Ms. Carr says it will- I've seen living proof!
B00280LYIC|5.0|AMAZING ALL I NEED FOR WORDS. THIS IS THE BEST BOOK IN THE FRIGGIN WORLD.I WANT YOU TO BUY THIS BOOK!!!!

B000SW4DV2|4.0|When my son plays the movie over and over I know it's good.  It's a good plot and the animation is great
0385535147|5.0|I love Mr Grishham's novels and have read and have almost all he has written and have seen the movies that have been made from his writings...
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|this game is just like any other hidden object game, but it's especially hard to see, even with magnifying glasses. and i don't like the way you get penalized 20 seconds for mistakes, which it calls &quot;random taps&quot;. and it's on a timer which is annoying. considering the amt. of space it takes up on my kindle and the level of boringness, it's not worth keeping on my device. i decided to uninstall after just 2 levels.
0399157565|5.0|I love her books.  I have kept up with this character since the first novel..and I have them all!!! Am just now realizing that Lucy is Ms. Cromwell!!!
B007N9FKCY|5.0|so far, i love this little game which runs flawlessly on my kindle fire. but all i have done so far is re-play the first level a bunch of times, trying to get a handle on the controls. i really enjoy jumping this little bean around and the controls seem perfectly responsive, but it's hard to master them because you have to time your side-to-side moves perfectly with the bounces, to make the bean do what you want. it's cool that you can go backward (left) and try for jumps or gems as often as you want, it just racks up your jump count.<br /><br />the graphics are really cute. i was worried that they'd be *too* retro &amp; hard to look at, but the balance is just right. the music is pretty good and so are the sound effects, but it's nice that you can turn either or both of them off. it's easy &amp; fun to navigate around the game, choosing levels etc., and the main menu even has an exit button, which i think was very considerate on the part of the developer.<br /><br />overall, a fun and challenging game that will stay on my kindle for a while.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is good to watch a movie or series without a lot of computer inhances..To me that is what it is all about, just good actors interacting and telling a story!!!
B009E3EY38|5.0|How is it that most of the old performers voices are trashed and Plant's voice sounds like their studio albums? Maybe he can't hit the high notes, but it wasn't noticeable- except possibly thru the exclusion of tunes like The Immigrant Song. Jimmy and John Paul are perfect and they saty close to the original arrangements. None of this \\"I'll play it like I want to till it's unrecognizable\\"- garbage that so many acts do today.<br />Buy it! I guarantee that you won't regret it. I've watched it every night for 6 days. The CD's are also great listening material.<br />Enjoy!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is my favorite read of the year so far. Although, I anticipated that I would have trouble with the narrative's temporal structure and the shifting POV's, the overlapping, ins and outs, worked very, very well.<br /><br />\\"The Night Circus is a phantasmagorical fairy tale set near an ahistorical Victorian London in a wandering magical circus that exists only from sunset to sunrise. Le Cirque des Rêves features such wonders and \\"ethereal enigmas\\" as a blooming garden made all of ice and a fire-breathing paper dragon. Its truly magical nature is occluded under the guise of legerdemain. The curious circus develops avid fans who distinguish themselves to each other by wearing the black and white of the circus tents, with a splash of red. The magicians Prospero the Enchanter and the enigmatic Mr. A.H-- groom their young proteges, Celia and Marco, to proxy their rivalry with the exhibits as a stage.\\" - Summary from Wikipedia (yes, I hate writing summaries)<br /><br />The Night Circus is imaginative, surprising, and enthralling. Morgenstern does a gorgeous job of building the narrative and tightening the noose until the explosive ending. A really unique read, overall I loved the style of the novel and Morgenstern's stunning use of language. There were some hiccups in the novel, I would have liked the fate of the initial catalog of characters to be more organically woven into the novel's close. The threads of the novel were gathered a little haphazardly at the end so it felt rushed in some places. Although, in the novel's defense, Celia's unraveling lends itself to the frenetic close. The frame narrative was also rather ingeniously revealed. Loved the novel!!
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|I agree that Ben Affleck is proving himself as a director to be reckoned with in the years ahead. This isn't as surprising as one might at first think.  Affleck has already won the Oscar as a writer, not as an actor.  The public, however, knows him best as an actor (and as the disastrous romantic counterpart to J-Lo in earlier years).  It is not at all unusual for a writer to move into directing because he already understands how to move a story forward conceptually, visually, thematically and technically.  I personally preferred his earlier film as director, GONE BABY GONE, because he had his brother play the leading man.  I think Casey is the better actor of the two of them.  When they work together they are an unbeatable combination and five stars all the way. If you have not seen that film, see that one first.<br /><br />So although this movie is very good, I doubt if it is the best one we will see from Affleck. He does an ok job as the leading man, a CIA operative who extricates people from places. The best part of the movie is his crackpot idea to call hostages in Iran part of a film crew from Canada and extract them from Iran on that basis.  In order to do this he has to go to Hollywood, get a producer, a script and so forth.  Alan Arkin and John Goodman help him put it together as his producers.  Those two are the best part of the movie, especially Alan Arkin, who works fiercely to make it a go deal.<br /><br />There are problems doing the extraction of course and Affleck gets overly get caught up in chase scene gimmicks.  But all in all this film is very good but if it wins the Oscar, as is being noised about, then I can only conclude it is a year weak in feature films.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B006GWO5NE|4.0|Only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is you still have to have a power adapter to go with it to be able to charge your kindle fast.  You could use just this cable if you have an extra usb port on your computer.......but I don't always have my desktop with me and sometimes I take my kindle to work and want to charge it there to be able to read on my breaks!
B0062P3392|5.0|I didnt know the movie existed until I saw the trailer and even though it is a remake, I will have to see the original just to compare them.

B009X01C64|5.0|I bought this case for no reason other than its ability to stand up in both portrait and landscape positions. Once the Kindle is snapped into place it is near impossible to remove as I can attest to. Yes I managed to install the Kindle so the ports and switches were not available even after reading the destruction sheet on how to properly install the Kindle. After giving it a good going over I can honestly say it is well constructed and should outlast me considering I am older than dirt. My only concern when shopping for a case was the cost for this particular case. I had a difficult time in justifying the what I considered the case being overpriced, but I sprung for it and now feel it is well worth the cost.<br /><br />I also think anybody that doesn't give the case a 5 star rating are no doubt chronic complainers and can find fault with anything and everything they own.<br /><br />The less than 5 star ratings aside I would recommend this case to anybody interested in protection and multi-use of their Kindle.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|I put my standard \\"collectors edition\\" DVD in my new blueray player and began watching it on my new 1080p LCD. OMG, the picture was so bad. Everything was out of focus, artifacts and noise and who knows what. I think I only managed to watch about 10 minutes. I immediately logged on to Amazon and ordered the blueray version. The blueray version is so much better. So much so that I think a copy of Gump should be included with purchase of every new blueray player sold in the world. This is a no-brainer- if you own a blueray player you MUST own blueray Gump.
1451695195|2.0|This books fundamental message could have been written in a long article.  Too much time was spent going over his personal life which in itself is beautiful but is not essential to proving main story line. It felt like an additional story was needed to complete 180 pages. In general I found this book not very inspiring and too little information about the other side especially when compared to other related book. As an engineer and seeker for over a decade, I am 100% convinced Eben's story is real. I was just looking for something a little deeper. This book should do well with many intellectual agnostics.

B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun and had a great message! What we have come to expect from Disney/Pixar, great quality entertainment.

B005LAIH4A|3.0|Funny, heart warming, so histerical my nieces and nephews think this is the best Doctor Seuss movie there is. Did a great job plot and animation!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I never really considered myself a fan of anything, except of Andre Norton, but I think I've been hoodwinked into becoming a Firefly fan. Saw Serenity and loved the movie. Saw the series, loved that too. Watched to interview at the commicon (sp?) and, well, you get the picture.<br /><br />Serenity is a great scifi story with lots of unexpected twists and turns that keeps the mind not only asking \\"what's next?\\" but \\"why?\\". The mystery of it all keeps this story moving on a fast track as wee tidbits are revealed here and there but cannot really be pieced together until the decision is made to follow where the mystery leads. It's an intriguing mystery with fascinating characters and mind-boggling adventures. What's not to like?<br /><br />One of my favorite parts? How Mal gets hoodwinked into a mission against his will. I know how he feels.
B005LAIGW8|3.0|The movie came as described,...played great,..sound was good.....but again in this movie,...the plot was lame.Nothing like the first movie,....need real help in plot and making movies, i thought Cage was better then this,......

0062011847|3.0|Automatically starts with a four star max since this one features no witches.  It was okay, not his best, but who we kidding, have to read it anyway.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|Great story line, great morals good things to teach our children, would recomend this to any age group. funny, sad and very heartwarming!!.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good for killing time!! Definitley makes you want to play more everytime you lose! I would recommend it for sure!
B005LAIH54|4.0|great special effects,..for mythhology Harry Hamlin should watch this and know a real warrior,..but special effects back then was just a trash can lid and a wooden sword,..compared to what we have today!!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|It really serves a practical purpose and good reasons why anyone who wants to can get organized, and its much easier with less stuff! After you read it once it become a great reference book.
B004EPZ034|3.0|Funny, entertaining, imaginative, Alvin and the boys out done there selves in this one. I just hope they will continue growing up in there movies though!! It is not good letting our young ones watch movies were the actors are so disobedient to there parents.<br />Because of movies like this today,..i believe that is why our society is the way it is!! But good movie
B000J3OTTQ|3.0|The movie is worth viewing simply to see Channing Tatum. I was told he danced a lot which was not really true. I was hoping to see a lot of his dancing. Overall the movie was not a waste of time.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Great plot, great actors,.... well put togather,...except for being a little predictable. Would i seeit again? yes i would<br />That is why i bought a copy!! Be careful of who you call here or from where???

0062200909|5.0|The first chronicle in the series, Art and Design presents hundreds of full color conceptual drawings and paintings, along with set designs, sculpture and photography. The book showcases art by the film's concept art directors, Alan Lee and John Howe, alongside work from other artists of the film's 3 foot 7 (which used to be 3 foot 6 when making Lord of the Rings) Art Department, Costume Department and Weta Workshop.<br /><br />Included is a foreword by Academy Award winner Dan Hennah, 3 foot 7 Production Designer for the films. The book also features commentaries by Dan, 3 foot 7 Costume Designer Ann Maskrey, Peter King, 3 foot 7 Make-up and Hair Designer, and Weta Workshop's Design and Special Effects Supervisor Richard Taylor.<br /><br />There is a fold out Thorin's map with glow in the dark runes printed on it as well as a copy of Bilbo's contract which is pretty awesome, though not quite as good as the prop replicas. It's great to see so many awesome and detailed pics of all the Dwarves, everything from their weapons to close up shots of their beards and clothing. Since it'll be at least 4 months until the Blu-Ray release of this movie, this is the next best thing to all the special features to come on the home video front. I've watched all the special features for Lord Of The Rings a few times now and love to watch how all these master craftsman use their skill and talent to bring things to life. This book is a great inside look into how this movie was designed and then subsequently executed. Highly recommended.
B004APVI1G|4.0|I bought this movie because I'd seen reviews that it was visually stunning and was excellent in 3D.  I was not disappointed.  The plot isn't exactly new, good vs. evil, young hero facing overwhelming odds, etc.  What saves the story is that you can identify with the characters and that the actors whose voices give life to them, are perfectly cast.  The 3D is truly excellent, with no visible artifacts and some of the effects were truly wondrous.  I'm no expert on animation, but can only describe it as awesome.  Audio quality is excellent throughout the movie.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that occasionally, the movie departs from it fairly dark plot, to remind you it is based on a children's story.  That makes it feel uneven and can even jar you out of the mood that had been set.  Maybe, it is just that I'm too old for kid's stories.<br /><br />One final thing.  There is one sequence where Soren embarks on a particularly dangerous task.  The music that accompanies the scene is so very haunting and perfect for what is happening, it is impossible to forget it.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I absolutely love, love, love this album!  I ordered one for myself and my best friend. This album definitely rocks!
B004G600A4|5.0|I ordered this as a gift for my little girl so it's all wrapped up but I really love this movie and can't wait to watch it with her! The shipping was really fast it got here in two days!!
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Really like the way the game is set up. It has great graphics, color and sound. Good thing you can turn down the sound and music when needed. Overall good game.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Excellent film as the Twilight saga continues. You can't go wring with entire collection of Twilight films. I jsu saw Part II in the theatre & hate to see the saga end!
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game its preety awesome but its not the latest update 4.3.1 but overall its awesome :D I wish there were more vehicles though
B00125WAWS|5.0|This movie is great.  It is educational and explains the debate process some, it also has a lot of history to it.  Good movie!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Cool This app is great!! What I like most is that you can link it to all of your devices.
B00908DDZM|5.0|JUST BUY IT! AND SEARCH FOR THE THRIFT SHOP VIDEO, RIDICULOUS AWESOMENESS! NOT BAD FOR A COUPLE OF WHITE BOYS! B.A IS WHY
B007BVOEPI|5.0|Very well made. If your a fan you will definately enjoy it. Those who have not read the books will love it as well.
B000002GVO|5.0|The product came very fast and worked great!!! Very pleased with this product! It was a great stocking stuffer for my mother!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is wonderful.  Much more detail than the movie has.  If you like the movie, read the book to find out a lot of things you don't know.  If you haven't seen the movie, read the book first!  It's worth it.  Great start to the series.
0446693804|4.0|`A Walk to Remember' is one of those novels that I can unapologetically admit I know inside and out.  In fact, this was the first Nicholas Sparks novel that caught my attention, after having viewed the movie of the same name starring Mandy Moore and Shane West.  I have forever been a huge Mandy Moore fan and after I watched said movie, I had to get my hands on the book that inspired it.  There is no doubt that there is quite some difference between the two, and this is partly due to the nature of the target audience the two formats are reaching out to.  However, the foundations of this amazing tale are still the same.<br />The reason why this novel has touched me so is that I was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia, an autoimmune disorder that has affected my bone marrow (in a similar way to leukaemia) at exactly the same age as the lead character, Jamie Sullivan, was diagnosed with acute leukaemia.  Seeing the film really helped me to realise that I was most certainly not alone with my condition and here was something I could relate to.  After reading the book, Sparks' novel really helped me to put my life into context and to share my experience with those who have been in similar situations, whilst spreading the word of this rare condition that has greatly affected my life.<br />The novel itself is based on Sparks' own observations within his family life, and Jamie Sullivan is said to be based on his sister, who went through a similar tale but ultimately passed away.  As the preface promises, `first you will smile, then you will cry', which is no bad thing.  I am not going to go in to too much detail surrounding the plot of the novel as I believe a lot of people reading this review will either already be familiar with it, and for those who aren't it isn't something worth spoiling.  Several themes and messages pervade throughout the book, including a sense of Christian kinship, growing up, forgiveness and, ultimately, love.  `A Walk to Remember' is an unforgettable coming-of-age tale that will undoubtedly make you cry, laugh and beg for more.ing-of-age tale that will undoubtedly make you cry, laugh and beg for more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A very good read.  Great ending to the series.  Couldn't put it down.  It's good to find out what happens to all the favorite characters.
B00005JMCN|5.0|The disc was in perfect working order.  We thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and we would highly recommend it to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really good book.  Definately need to read The Hunger Games first...and you will not be able to wait to read Mockingjay!
0670451495|5.0|This is a wonderfully illustrated story of a Mama Duck in the city of Boston who stops traffic as she seeks to take her babies across the street to the park. It is masterfully written by the author Robert McCloskey (read another book of McCloskye's, Homer Price).
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|It was hilarious I just couldn't stop reading and I finished it in to nights if I were you I would read this right away it was the best book of the series and I should know i read the hole series of diary of a wimpy kid and this is the best one
0307352145|5.0|I loved this book because the author carefully lays out the argument for why being an introvert is not a negative as most of the world likes to believe.  The author teaches how this is a gift, just as each character trait is, and shares how it can be used in a positive way.
0786956291|3.0|I write this from the perspective of someone who has friends that are reluctant to try games like this.  Trying to get everyone through character creation at once while I had them all sitting down was an impossible nightmare.  I am still having flashbacks.  Are we supposed to ask each player to read through the whole thing while everyone else sits there with a thumb up their butt?  Really?<br /><br />So I tried to take turns, keeping people interested in the little goblin wagon scenario given as a Skyrim-esque start to the adventure.  Unfortunately, since the book reads like a choose your own adventure novel, flipping from one random page to the next, you cannot trace your way back when switching to the next player, without going clear to the beginning and following each page direction back to the most recent point.  This doesn't seem so bad until you are halfway in.  Then... nightmare.<br /><br />It would have worked much better if the instructions for each class and race were in each section, where I could read it and let them pick their stat arrays and abilities at the same times.  Honestly, if you are like me, skip this and get the PHB and run everyone through at the same time.<br /><br />The DM book comes with a single adventure, and only the ability to get to level 2.  So you get a couple hours out of it before you need to shell out anyways, so save yourself the trouble.  The little discs aren't nearly as cool as actual miniatures, and the cards are pointless since you cannot buy more of them for higher level abilities and aren't needed to actually play.<br /><br />Overall, while it seemed pretty cool at first, it's actually a very gimped version of the D&D experience, without adding any real accesibility, unless you want to play solo.
B00AKKGX4W|3.0|This book was just missing something. I couldn't agree with the rest of the 5-star reviews. I was really looking forward to this book coming out. I loved the Unveiled series and thought the short novella introducing the characters was great. However, this book seemed to set you down right in the middle of the characters interactions, feelings, emotions. There was no build up. They met, they loved, that was it. Even their back stories didn't really resonate. I thought that Richard was more fully formed than Minnie, but neither really had much emotion to them. It just didn't mesh. The whole trial scene at the end was ridiculous and pointless, especially considering he just got rid of the \\"villian\\" with no real resolution. This is not a book that I want to reread and reread.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|you cant  get out of this game unless you turn your device off but over all its ok but not the best app to for sure
B00AJLHUYO|5.0|This movie I have to say, is one of the best horror film's I have seen in theaters since \\"Orphan\\" (2009). I don't get scared easily and the movie brought chills down my spine!!! The dialogue in the film was good, the acting was much better than expected (I am a huge fan of Ethan Hawk from Day Breakers, the cinematography was perfect, the story definitely carried out smoothly, and the idea behind the movie and having a descent original supernatural climax was really what kept this movie on the edge of your seat! A lot of horror films in the past that are about supernatural things but end up having a human climax is disappointing to me in most movies (cry wolf, sorority row, etc). The ending really caught me off guard, and ended in a way that makes u feel cold and creeped out. This movie makes you think. I don't know how anyone wouldn't find this film creepy, or sick to say the least and if you don't think so then something is seriously wrong with you. Amazing film! Wish there was an extended cut, but o well! Very original and creepy. People don't seem to realize this kind of movie hasn't really been thought before (families dying together without any control) and it gives you a really bad feeling in your stomach.
B0064NTZKI|5.0|If you are a fan or even just a general appreciator you will enjoy hanging out with Woody in this doc as much as one of his better movies. Even with two discs this is a tight doc with no filler. Woody doesn't disappoint and you come out liking him even more than when you went in, which says a lot. Great stuff, don't let yourself put off watching it like I did.
B000AP04OM|5.0|The Sound of Music is timeless and teachers wonderful lessons about giving, loving, and loyalty.  Every family should view this movie together.
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Not a bad movie. Interesting pretense. Pretty predictable. Having grown up in the country (Appalachia) I could relate to much of it and really identified with the area it was filmed. I spent much of my childhood running around in parts to the north. I'm sure the part 2 and 3 will focus more on the love story... whatever. Probably worth the $5 for the rental.
B00011D1OA|5.0|A more sophisticated take on the Cinderalla story My Fair Lady is a classic.  The clothes, the music, and the language all make this movie unforgettable and very entertaining for the whole family.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|It was very well written. It kept me on the edge of my seat and was hard to put the book down.  It was especially interisting to me as my uncle served with them.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app for all of you Pinterest fans out there. I love pinterest and I have no downfalls to the app on my Kindle.IT works wonderfully.
B007TK77QE|2.0|One of the most boring books I have ever read (well I have read 46% of the book so far).  Can this woman have written Harry potter?  A b<br />Casual vacancy
B008KE3960|4.0|Great twist on the standard defense game.  There is a bit of a limited market for aircraft in the game, making it fairly simple to buyout the inventory within a few levels.  The learning curve scales well, though some later stages can become frustratingly difficult.
B00631VJIC|5.0|The music on this cd has taken me for miles and miles of walking and healing.  The Forest Rangers are gritty, earthy real and passionate.  They hit me in the center of my heart...And Katy, I love you!
B005Y8KWNS|2.0|it just won't launch, tried it many times.  from other reviews I've read, it doesn't look like I'm the only one with problems.
B008YJFDQK|5.0|Its very simple and straight forward.....I love it.  AS always with Ben, many reminded of lessons... Nancita of the earth.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I am a backpacker and hiker who has hike a small part of the Pacific Crest Trail.  At first I thought, how could anyone do part of this trail without planning??  But her experiences on this trip and the way her story is written pulls you in and keeps you interested.
0446547573|4.0|I have never read Nicholas Sparks because I am a cry-baby and I blubber easily at sentimental tales.  I did fine on this one, even though the situations for both Katie and Alex are sad ones.  This book reminded me very much of the movie &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy&#34; with Julia Roberts.  It also has a little of Sixth Sense in it.  Since I live in NC and not far from Southport, I am anxious to see the movie when it comes out.
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book.  Loved how Rebecca brought the Henrietta and her family in to the story, making us more aware of what she went through and how society benifited.
B006YGC7KK|5.0|Good subjects and really action packed. it is so addicting to watch this television series it going to want you to see more and more.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Great book.  This book made me not really like Steve Jobs.  I love how it pointed out what it takes<br />to be truly great.  Nothing comes easily for anyone.  What a genious.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|awesome!!!  and on blue ray even better!! kevin mckidd and ray stevenson are great in this series.  i had watched it on hbo before and then i saw ray stevenson on dexter this season, and it made me want to watch this again.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|The product was new, nicely packaged and came in a timely matter. I had no problems with the experience whatsoever!
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|I'm writing this review basically to offset all the one stars.  It is a fairy tale, plain and simple.  It's not shakespeare and it's not meant to be. I'm not a Kristin Stewart fan either and I didn't go see it at the theatre because of that.  But I rented it and was surprised at how much I liked it.  I don't think it deserves the one star that a lot of people are giving it. The special effects are awesome, although to be honest I was dissappointed in the mirror not being a real mirror, but what ever.  It was a great fantasy.
B00125WAXC|5.0|I love anything Denzel is in.  This movie --- a true story ---- does not disappoint.  Got it for my grandson who is on a debate team.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I wasn't expecting much when my friends threw this in the Blu-ray player at their house, but boy, was I ever surprised. We were all almost on the floor, laughing hysterially at the rampant tomfoolery that this comedic gem delivers! Every actor in \\"Horrible Bosses\\" does a fantastic job, but I would have to say that the perpetually subdued, somewhat confused Jason Bateman steals the show from his high powered costars.<br /><br />WARNING: This movie is ridiculously funny, but never, EVER attempt to watch it with your children, regardless of their age, or you will be THOROUGHLY embarrassed! And as a final note: the outtakes/blooper reel included on the special features is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I've watched it at least a dozen times, and it always makes me laugh so hard that I almost cry!
B007L96SI6|2.0|I don't like this cd since this is not a Haley Reinhart that I want to listen.<br />To bad that the producers make her to go to the wrong direction.Bad for the start.Please come back to the blues and rock music.
B004A8ZWWO|2.0|Once again, Eddie Murphy must've been low on money or was low on money during the time when he made this because this movie was boring as hell and sucked big time, just like that movie, \\"1000 Words,\\" which highly, HIGHLY sucked, and another movie where he must've been low on cash and just decided to make a b.s. movie and say, \\"hey, I know this movie's gonna suck but hell, people gonna go see it because I'm Eddie Murphy.\\" well, both movies are not worth the reel that they were made on. Don't waste your money ordering this movie unless you're an Eddie Murphy-fan. Gabby was the only interesting person in the movie(my opinion).
B0041QSZJM|5.0|If you're tired of the same old same old, this is for you.  It has selections for Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's, sung in English, Japanese, Chinese, Hebrew, French, Italian, Spanish, and maybe a couple of others I can't remember off the top of my head.  Want to hear White Christmas in Japanese?  How about a Hanukkah song in Spanish? Or the spunkiest rendition of Auld Lang Sine ever in the history of the world?  Then buy this CD.  You won't regret it.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great movies  .  Great  price.  Don't hesitate to buy this  .  Nicely boxed.  Includes a nice booklet .<br />You won't find a better price
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I watch the original movie in which I have also wanted to get the animated one great movie altogether. Get it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Interesting and thrilling continuation in the series, very surprising!!! I can't wait to finish the series out!!! GO Sylvia Day!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I read a lot of mystery novels and this one had me till the end. The emotions just dripped from the pages. Can't wait to read the rest of these books.
0345803507|3.0|This trilogy just has you going throughout but the ending of &#34;happily ever after&#34; is disappointing as it alludes to romantic literature.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Just kidding. It's actually kind of addicting and that's the last thing I wanted to happen. I've pretty much just gotten over Mine Craft. Anyway, Dragonvale works good on the Kindle Fire.
0345803493|4.0|The second book of the trilogy is light reading that keeps the story going of Christian Grey and his romantic antics.
B0000DCGT3|4.0|The wedding is most definitely necessary in the American Pie Series.  Unrated version way better of course, just make sure there are no kids around!!!! Boobs are everywhere so be warned.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is rad. Love it. Like simcity but its free. I would recommend it to anyone. Just takes time.
080013558X|5.0|it was the best tape ever i liked it a lot i would reccamend it to every one because once the watch it they will really like it from kids to adults
B00992CF6W|4.0|&quot;There was an error downloading Minecraft Pocket edition&quot;what's wrong with my download? I know its not my data space I have ample and the download isn't that large
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case works very well to keep from bumping the phone. I did not find the clear plastic cover useful.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I love hidden object games. I accept that there are limitations based on screen size. I'm having fun with it anyway. Pinch to zoom works except on find the difference puzzles. Cute story with well drawn graphics. I wish more hidden object games were this well rounded!
1401223176|5.0|Of all the comics I have Batman is probably the most abundant in my collection simply because I love how close to real his stories are, leaving the super natural out. That being said I was so upset when I read Bruce Wayne is heading over to Metropolis. I truly hate Superman prior to reading this comic. I continued reading with bad intentions but I have to say I love how they incorporated Superman to this comic, it just works. I wont get into the details of how it works just for the sake of spoilers. This leads to another point of why I love and recommend this comic. HUSH has probably the most villains and heroes in a single Batman story. Don't be afraid because Loeb actually incorporates every single character so well it doesn't feel over-saturated, each character has a worthy purpose; some more than others. Oh and I can't forget to mention the artwork, hands down my favorite artwork in a comic!
B00ACM0VB4|5.0|love love it and love it!!!!!<br />i got it on time and had no probles with the showing of the dvd.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Love Adam Levine and Maroon 5.  The music is awesome.  The musicians are excellent.  I think they play a style that would many people would enjoy.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Huge fan of Seth McFarland, so I had to watch this movie.  I laughed so hard!  Loved the Family Guy references too!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I wake. up every day same time so I get to school and it hats cool choices in sound weather and time
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Very fun movie! Quite a few laugh out loud moments. The family's favorite was Christmas, and we *loved* Mr. Norris's entrance.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|It can be very difficult to find new (and older) electronica music and DI Radio offers an excellent selection to listen to.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Great case, elimates the need to carry the special cable which I was concerned woudl get lost.  Also it protect the headset.
0374275637|3.0|If the above book were a 200-page work I would give it 5 stars! However, the author wrote it like a text book where major ideas are repetitive, having in mind that its readers must fully memorize those ideas. In the next edition, the author could skim off its best sections as to produce a compact version. In doing so, the book will attract further readers that are not willing to spend many reading hours to learn the same topics again and again.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|So many versions of the movie in one pack! What a fun time this was. I like to measure films like this with popcorn, and I'd call this a two-bagger! So much action, I couldn't stop eating! Very well written. VERY well directed.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Love, love, love Chickenfoot! This is a great cd for rock and roll fans.  Looking forward to future releases by this band.
0446581356|5.0|This book has everything- I love that it's about taking care of yourself, that is when you are your most beautiful and natural! I love that it has tips for different ethnicities- very useful for an aspiring makeup artist like myself!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book kept me hanging on every word. The detail made it a real fantasy the image of every act clouding my thoughts. I recommend to everyone readers and non especially.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cheats me out of my posting investment points. Other than that lots of fun. But need those points!!! Any help?????? Please I want to expand
0316228532|4.0|I was impressed by the leap JK Rowling took from a young adult author to adult lit.  The plot was intriguing and an interesting take on human nature and interactions.  She does a good job developing her characters and setting and revealing the hidden predjudices in her characters.  It was worth the read.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|This is a must-see with all your girlfriends!  Can't get enough of this show! So many laughs ~ simply because, we've all been there!  Highly recommended!
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie displays some great special effects, but the acting is weak and the plot very predictable. The story winds aimlessly without a clear direction or intention.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this movie and watch it several times a week...I'm very pleased with the quality of the product and the price was phenomenal.
B007MP0QNC|5.0|This item was purchased as a &#34;Secret Santa&#34; gift. I received my book within a timely manner, too! Although, I don't have any interest in reading the book, the quality is great. I'd recommend this item to a friend.
B00006JSS8|5.0|This one will blow your socks off because you can actually see within his soul on occaision, this is love.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Just another excellent CD of Enrique, and a must have if you love his music. He's hot, and his music sizzles!!!
B00004SZWD|5.0|A great peaceful collection released in his prime, I believe.  Don't miss out on this great music, buy now.  Or you'd miss out on something beautiful.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This is another animated movie with messages for all ages.  My 3-year-old granddaughter asked me to watch it with her, but I had to rent the movie to see the whole show.<br /><br />The anthropomorphic rats brought class and value to the restaurant business in the end.  The message to pursue dreams...and bring others along...is the stuff of the entrepreneurial spirit.<br /><br />This is a delightful story that causes us to set aside first impressions and consider values for what they are.
B00785P2QC|3.0|game is okay at best. very tedious and you wont get far without purchasing items. not a huge fan personally but not a bad game.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Tommy Emmanuel is one of if not the best guitarist ever.  He is delightful to watch and uses his guitar like I've never seen anyone before.  He needs no orchestra, he is the orchestra.  You will not be disappointed.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|well this is a very very fun game with puzzles this is actually fun because your bagging groceries for points and mini games.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|I love this film! This is one of my all time favorites! Liam Nesson rocks in this film. It was very entertaining and full of suspense. I would put it up as one of my top 10 films!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|I am a female who so enjoys Mr Connelly's books. The three short stories were not long enough, I needed more info, I needed more stories. When you read a short story and you crave more of it then you know this is a very good read.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Wonderful twists that can't help but leaving the reader fulfilled. I would recommend to all who feel they have none.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I use this sharpener for almost all my knifes and its going strong it is a great buy don't think twice its great for all smaller knives!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I love this flash, its small and does it job pretty well. Also the price is cheap that you can afford to pay. I like it because you can bounce the flash but you can only bounce it towards the ceiling. This flash makes your picture much different and add a nature look if you bounce the flash correctly. It does not cause the picture to white out due to direct flash. I would recommend this flash to those who want good pictures but do not want to spend big bucks on bigger flash. Did I mention its light and compact.
B0000025BL|5.0|For me, the best album ever written and the only one that Meat ever sung really well.<br />Each song is a Jim Steinman classic.<br />Listen to the song Bat Out of Hell 20 times and you will find some detail in the music that you didn't notice before.<br />Unfortunately, Meat has become a sort of charicature of himself with cheesey operatic rock songs, sung fairly poorly.<br />His voice changed after this album, and for the worst by far. Dead Ringer was OK, but not much beyond. The voice went deeper and he started trying to put too much meaning in the songs.<br />These songs are fun, taking the mickey out of life and teenage love.<br />The ONLY decent songs meatloaf sung are by Steinman, and outside this album, sound better when other artists have sung them.<br />The last song \\"Crying Out Loud\\" took me a while longer to get in to, but is sung so well, and has an amazing arrangement.<br />IF you do like this, try Jim Steinman's less known album \\"Original Sin\\" by Pandoras Box. Most of the songs were covered later by Meat, but are much better here. There are a couple of duds, and an irritating Steinman Monologue (no Jim, they are not funny!!), but the rest is awesome, almost on the same level as Bat Out of Hell album.<br />I've been lstening to Bat Out of Hell for over 25 years and still love it.

1569757275|5.0|Got this form my friends. A a Chinese, I know the amazing, funny, disgusting terms used in the book. Hilarious! Has some useful, 'regular' phases in it too. Great gift for anyone who is learning Chinese.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|I think I must be the only person who grew up in the 60's and 70's and never heard of Grease. What can I say? Only that it was a totally new experience for me and I absolutely LOVE the movie! Based on other reviews this movie crosses all cultural lines and religious differences. The music is outstanding and this is one FUN movie that I now watch over and over again!
B0030IIYYS|4.0|This is a great family film that is easy to watch. My son loves this film so much and will sit and watch it from start to finish which is great for busy Mom's. Happy to recommend this one.
B000LGZHDS|5.0|This was a gift for 1 of my son's girlfriends & she was head over heals for it. She loves snails & this was the perfect size, perfect item to give her.
B00005JM02|4.0|I got this recently for my young son. He actually watches this one and gives me the chance to do things around the house. He is happy watching it so I would recommend this.
0345803485|3.0|I had heard so much about this book and naturally had to get 1 of my own. I love to read but found this book kind of predictable and boring. Overated by far!!!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Everything you've heard about this show, it's true; it's gripping, it's thought-provoking, it's definitely a must-watch. Season 2 is quite disappointing, frankly, but the first season is great.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|All the issues mentioned earlier seem to have been fixed.  Thumbs up to debs for listening to us!  You van zoom and if you hit the menu button during dialog the skip button is conveniently hilighted.<br /><br />The game is pretty fun, with objects fairly well hidden.  The story line is an obvious Harry Potter clone...but hey it works...
B004EPZ0AM|5.0|I came to amazon.com to buy myself a copy of this movie.  I am a 35 year old mother of 3 children, ages 6,10 and 12. We all thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I actually loved it.  I like the first one but they really added even more humor and interest to the sequel.  Add to that....stunning visuals and great music, this is a movie that we'll get out and re-watch from time to time.  I must have it for my home library and our library is small (only the awesome movies make it in).  I'm disappointed so many people wrote such negative reviews about a movie I loved so much.  Really, unless you just despise anything animated, hate music or are one of those \\"hopelessly miserable\\" types, you will, at a minimum, enjoy this film.
B007XNAQPG|5.0|Another good one, ok! I hate to say it but I'm obsess with Duran Duran. It started in 1981 to the present, I love listening to Simon Lebon voice and the group still looks good! Rock on 80's!!!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Controls take a moment to get used to but quickly. enough you will be having no problems. For sure a fun game.
B000001EC1|4.0|bought this for my husband. he likes it. i like bon jovi, but i tend to go for his newer music, he has mellowed out some. still sounds great, but not so much what i call &#34;headache&#34; music!
030758836X|5.0|This book was amazing. It was insane and unpredictable and un-put-downable. I opened it to read a few chapters before bed and stayed up until my eyes were too tired to focus, then picked it right back up the next day. I will definitely be picking up her other books, this is far from the dull mysteries I've read before.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|i love mahjong, and this one is ok, tho the levels are not very challenging. good for a late night session tho.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it AWESOME graphics easy to play and suitable for all ages glad it was free but would have bought also.
B005RYF5JA|5.0|i really enjoy listening to these young ladies. they are very talented, and i wish i could hit the high notes like Chloe does!
B000FC12L4|5.0|This book was so amazing, totally absorbs you and is the perfect follow up to Sabriel . It's almost as if you were in the story, seeing it and experiencing it . Stoked to read Abhorsen .
B0054JZC6E|2.0|do not like this one. won't be buying it.am very glad for the free trial sessions, would hate to pay money for it.
B001HC8516|5.0|I felt this book was very imformative, got alot of insight as to what my relationship was all about.  It was very humourous at time and captivating, would suggest this book to all woman who are in relationship's and wondering where to go from there.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|There is no new artist who can drop flawless record after flawless record like Abel. This album has sounds from almost every genre, and uses them in a symphonic harmony. His vocal work gets compared to MJ because it is really up there.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Didn't care for this final book at all. I didn't enjoy this book nearly as mu c h as Ted he first two.
B003T6GVWI|5.0|This album, man. It's magical, it's sweeping, it's warm and comforting. The absolute standout tracks are Everything Is Beautiful, Illusion, Better Than Today, and All the Lovers. I can take or leave Too Much which was done with Calvin Harris. Aphrodite took me a while to get into but it's lovely if you listen past the intro if you don't like it at first. Cupid Boy is infectious and adorable. This kind of music just makes you want to get up and dance and smile instead of moping around feeling down on life. It's invigorating and wakes you up.
B003O86FMW|4.0|glad i  went ahead and read this rather than stopping after the first book. Will go ahead and read the final one.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|I love this app I am so glad they made it the free app of the day. I recommend to everyone out there to get it as the free app while you still can! If you don't like challenging games......
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|A fantastic new &#34;classic&#34; to add to your traditional Christmas viewing.  Heartwarming and beautifully done.  It's a must see for the season.
B002N14GPE|5.0|One of the  best  films ever.  I was given the chance to watch it although I have purchased it , makes no sense to me.  Give  me  somerhing  I  might want to purchase.  Why in the heck do I want to watch something  as a gift when I just bought it?<br /><br />  How about  Final Destination?<br /><br />  Thank You,<br />  Nora
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it is so cute and is good for people of all ages and it is a great way to move your thumbs and have fun.

B009186JYI|4.0|A chance to see the group before they became formula driven.  Jagger actually had some intelligent comments.  Interesting concert footage.  Worth the money, no doubt about it.

1592402038|5.0|English made logical (and funny). No MLA crap here.  If you are a novice or intermediate writer it is a wonderful guide.  If you are advanced, then it is refreshingly well written.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I gave this five stars for their distinctive service and the most wonderful and answered with their service and product was excellent
B00009YOQW|5.0|This drum is just the right size for my 10 month old grand daughter. The sounds are mellow and not super loud. It has a soothing (if you can imagine a drum being soothing) tonal quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As well as the other 2 books this book felt as if I experienced it myself<br />It felt like home sweet home
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|this is a good old yarn. it would appeal to anyone who likes Irish written fiction. IT is really the story of child abuse by religious bodies in Irish orhanages , although at the beginning you are drawn into believing it is about two strangers getting together through a lonely hearts column. I wouldnt really call the plot a fast moving one, but it ticks along nicely. I am not a fan of those child abuse stories so I scanned through those chapters, which is why I give it just 3 stars.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the series a lot, but the ending makes my head spin, such as why did Katniss kill president Coin? Did she go crazy? What happened?
B008HJJGKG|4.0|Like the new rugged Bond and needed to add this to my collection. Zon is the best place to find older movies.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you're trying to get your book out there for the world to see. This book gives you the basics in an easy-on-the-brain way!
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|I just finished watching Men in Black 3 and for the most part I enjoyed it.Josh Brolin portrayal of a younger K was incredible and right on target.It had some good humor sprinkled through out the action, and this one had more of a human touch to it. I thought the  bad alien was not up to par and just nothing to write home about compared to past outings. At times the story slowed down a bit but by the end credits it won me over.
B004EPZ02A|1.0|I wish there was negative reviews for this work. The first problem was the previews. The previews were awesome and actually told most of the story. When I got to the film however nothing from the previews was in the movie.  The  1st and 2nd movies rocked and are worth the price however the quality ends there. Don't waste your money on this one and I never saw the fourth one.<br /><br />Ultimately if you can't make your movies match your previews then something is seriously wrong with your work.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|This book is a good look at what happens to a child raised in a wealthy family, even though born in poverty, as opposed to that child's brother who was born in poverty and raised in poverty and turns to selling drugs to dig himself out of that situation.  I recommend it highly.  It is well written.  You can believe you are in India, especially if you have ever been there.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this one - there was plenty of action from beginning to end.  Keep them coming.  Thank you.
034580404X|5.0|I am a proud owner of the &#34;50 Shades Trilogy. If you've not read the 1st book, let alone the entire trilogy, what is stopping you?  I am on my 4th reading of it- it's like catnip!  I have not laughed or enjoyed myself as I have with these books in a long time. They are a fantasic read!<br />The 1st volume opens with Anastasia getting hooked into doing her roommates interview of the young CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings, Christain Grey.  The rest of the story is, in a nutshell, the discovery, the awakening, and  the depth and breath of  the growing love between these two characters.  They, like all the rest of us &#34;flawed&#34; humans, must find their way thru life one day at a time with all the attendant misteps that go along with living.  Anastasia & Christian manage to get past all their differences ( money, life experiences, family situations, life styles, worrysome ex's, etc.) to find the love and joy in each other.  Oh if you've not heard - there's SEX in these volumes!  Don't worry it won't kill you or turn you into a frog. It  may give you some interesting ideas of your own.<br /><br />I have read numerous reviews of these 3 volumes-after I read the books for myself-thank you.  Most of the shorter reviews were from very pleased readers, who like myself,completely enjoyed themselves. Most of the &#34;longer&#34; reviews seemed to be very critical of  E.L. James's work.  Guys these works are-----FICTION.  I do not consider them porn-soft, mommy or otherwise.  The back of volume 1 lists the genere as Erotic Romance, that says it all.  Complaints ranged from-Christian being drop dead gorgeous, super fit, too well endowed, wealthier then Croesus and superb lover just to list a few.  Anastasia is too shy, too inexperienced especially at the ripe age of 21 and her vocabulary for an English major is too restrictive.  The reviewers also didn't like the first person format, repetitive phrases and, seemed to me, the lack of rude, crude,vulgar sexual terms.  Oh yes they figured there was little if any editing done by the publishiers.<br /><br />My suggestion-get your hands on these books and have a great time!  Read them for what they are romamce first and foremost, spiced with (dare I say it) lots of love, humor and sex.s they figured there was little if any editing done by the publishiers.<br /><br />My suggestion-get your hands on these books and have a great time!

B003UBTX7C|5.0|The story moved quickly and kept me guessing every page.  This was my first Camel Club series and looking forward to reading how it came about.  THIS is one of my new favorites by David Baldacci.  Thanks for the entertainment.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The color and texture of the case material is better than I expected. The stand works very well. The only &#34;con&#34; is if you slide the cover too much to the left before raising it, the Kindle may not turn on automatically. The orientation of the Kindle in the case doesn't seem to matter. Overall it appears to be well made and fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; perfectly.
0761169431|5.0|This is a perfect gift for my son who loves to do oragami AND loves Star Wars...unique gift that he is going to love
B006J420UE|5.0|I upgraded my home PC a couple months ago and went too cheap on the CPU. This is the one I should've purchased the first time. Much better graphics performance and a quieter cooling fan. I'm running it stock, but it's nice to know I can overclock it.
B005FITIK0|4.0|Our son wanted this for Christmas. Our granddaughter said it was not a great movie, but we ordered it anyway since he wanted it.
B00005JMCT|5.0|Was able to buy this on a lightning deal for 1.99! Can't beat it! Also was able to use my prime account for it. Doesn't get much better.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|I've been a huge Rush fan for over 20 years. I feel like I know the band personally after watching this.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I read this book and wanted to watch the movie. This dealer was very very prompt on delivery. The movie I ordered was listed as new and new is what I received.
B006CA5NUY|3.0|It's still Korn but dubstep is annoying.... If I weren't such a fan of Jonathon Davis and the boys I would've swept this album under the rug with the rest of that dubstep crap...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Steve & Jon make such a great team. Covering so many facets of music, their perfomances are always beautiful, awe-inspiring, and emotional; other times they are just plain fun! I am both a cellist and pianist so I can really appreciate their musicianship. I bought this album and will purchase their future albums, so come on  guys - let's have some more!
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Overall a good movie. Johnny Depp is becoming redundant with his characters but continues to be a fantastic actor and Michell Pfeifer looks amazing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVED this book and I finished it in 1 day.  A perfect ending to a great series.  A Must read
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Absolutely love the MIB movies and this one is no exception. Will and Tommy do a great job and Josh as the young K was a perfect choice. Great storyline and hilarious action throughout!
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I got this for my son a few months back now and he still watches it from time to time. He will watch it to the end so I would recommend it.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|There was a lot of hype when this was released so I bought it as soon as I could. I enjoyed watching this with my son. It is entertaining and my son made it to the end without being distracted.
B00AHSMDQY|1.0|we were very frustrated because we had to restart movie 3 times because the &#34;system was down&#34;. Awesome movie once we were able to get it not to freeze up on us.
B001IXXYBA|4.0|This is a brilliant film, full of laughs and tears. This was so great when it came out. I watched it again the other day and it is still one of the best films I hae seen. I would recommend this one.<br />Comment Comment   Permalink
B004R63MWQ|5.0|I saw the original movie years ago when it hit the theaters so this follow-up 20 years later was so cool!  I absolutely love the movie soundtrack music!  I like to blast out the bass!  All the special effects were really great too!  I would definitely buy this one and have it in my library.  HD or Blueray would be better though.
B007XNAQL0|5.0|I have seen Peter live many times, but missed this show.  I bought it MANY years ago on VHS.  This year, I went from a 42\\" LCD fed by a stereo VHS/DVD to a 55\\" Smart LED fed by a 5.1 capable Blu-Ray.<br /><br />In general, most Blu-Rays I've been watching are like looking through a glass at REAL people and scenery.  Not the case here.  While the video is fine and very much watchable, it does not, verily CANNOT, compare to present day Hi Def recordings.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the audio quality is just amazing.  I'm running my audio through an optical SPDIF cable to an older RCA (100 watt for each of the 5 channels and capable of Dolby Digital DTS) attached to an RCA cube subwoofer.<br /><br />Gabriel fans know that bass plays heavily in his music (particularly when Tony Levin joins his tours).  The subwoofer and the 5 surround speakers make watching (listening) to this show akin to being there.  REALLY.  While I enjoyed my old VHS MANY times, THERE IS NO COMPARISON.<br /><br />WOW!  I'm just blown away and very busy rubbing my arms to calm the goose bumps I get listening to this great, great show.<br /><br />ENJOY!
B009JBZH54|1.0|This review isn't about the actual movie (which I give this combo 5 stars)its about the worthless ultraviolet digital copy that are so difficult to redeem.my opinion would be to stay away from ULTRAVIOLET  completely there's so many steps and new accounts to open just to redeem the digital copy.i had to open 3 accounts on three different sites to redeem one digital copy of a movie.ultraviolet needs to be removed from the digital world.go back to the easy digital download from the company named after a fruit which some movie makers still use because they care about the customer.
B000002I4W|3.0|The end of the 1950's was certainly a key time for the development of jazz. The schools that came to define the genre were really beginning to emerge at this point. This ended up in a great deal of controversy about the music. And it would be hard find to pin down someone whose musical approach was more controversial than Ornette Coleman. With be-bop already coming to it's peak,Ornette looked to abandon Charlie Parker's concept of improvising on the chords of a song and rather around the melodic and harmony aspects of it. This at the time would be known as \\"free jazz\\". But as many point out,how much more free could improvisational music actually be? Albums like this sought to answer those questions.<br /><br />  First off,the quartet involved on this album consists of incredibly talented individuals such as cornetist Don Cherry,who'd become an innovator in his own right,bassist Charlie Haden and drummer Billy Higgins. Honestly Billy is really even more challenged than Ornette is here,because he has to keep his ears open to what everyone else is saying. And Ornette and Don in particular say a lot. \\"Lovely Woman\\",\\"Eventually,\\"Congeniality\\" and \\"Chronology\\" in particular are chocked full of melodic ideas. However they are often in the form of what sounds like dozens being played simultaneously-like a very intense musical argument that concludes rather than resolves.<br /><br />  \\"Peace\\" and \\"Focus On Sanity\\" give themselves over to rather more bluesy but very quiet Charlie Haden bass lines. The result overall remains the same. The effect of melodic invention on this album is extremely overwhelming and intense. And to many some of it may sound like noise. To my own ears,I did find this music very difficult to listen to. Not because of the manner in which Ornette played,with was ultimately very exciting but rather by the mood and tone of the music itself. A good many of these alternating melodic/harmonic exchanges have a confrontational and frustrated quality about them. Not the degree someone like Archie Shepp might have,when the mood of his playing borders on enraged. Yet as unique and innovative as this music is,beautiful or pretty are not the terms I'd use to describe it at all.Not the degree someone like Archie Shepp might have,when the mood of his playing borders on enraged.

B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Good villain, good bad turned good guy, lots of fun in the tavern and a fun well written story. Can't go wrong!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Watched it with a new generation and they loved it. Funny to see all those actors as kids that we know from their adult roles now! Highly recommended for 5+ kids - some parts are a little scary.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Great game for hack and slash fans and its a free game level up your character upgrade weapons have fun with this
B001F6ZIXC|2.0|It would seem, at first, that Kurt Sutter wants to take his audience on a raucous ride alongside an outlaw motorcycle club (known as Sons of Anarchy, or S.O.A.).  The premise sounds promising, and it does't hurt that Ron Perlman (of Hellboy fame) takes a lead role.  My wife was initially reluctant to watch, saying that \\"some motorcycle thing\\" suited my tastes than hers.  Ironically, S.O.A. is now her favorite show.<br /><br />It took only a few episodes to realize I'd been sucker punched.  Sons of Anarchy is nothing but a paint-by-numbers melodrama documenting the lives of its female leads, Gemma and Tara.  Each sub-plot is intended to further explore their lives, a point that we are never allowed to forget.  The writers abandon the motorcycle club as nothing more than a minor plot-point, and we are left with an overly bloated and--even by day-time drama standards-- unbelievably cliched soap opera.<br /><br />After my wife took such an interest it, I found no diplomatic way of criticizing its contents without seeming critical of my her tastes.  As such, I resigned myself to spending an hour each week as a profoundly selfless act for the greater good or our marriage.  Still, the show managed to test this resign most notably in the Season 2 finale.  Before the screen even had a chance to could fade into the S.O.A. logo, I shot to my feet and barked, \\"What the &*#@ was that!  It doesn't even make *&#* sense!  I'm not watching this *$%# anymore!\\"  Even so, my wife was queueing up the next episode.<br /><br />In closing, I now present ways to pass time if you find yourself forced to watch such rubbish.  I entertain myself by counting the number of times Gemma will break down sobbing during any given episode.  Once you pick up on the formula, it's easy to do.  You can also count the number of times English actor Hunmann forgets his bizarre American accent (most obvious when he pronounces Charming as \\"Chahh-ming\\").  When S.O.A. writers quit trying to pretend they have a male audience in mind, you'll have no choice but to make a game of it all.  For all the scenes where some \\"Jax-ass\\" is scripted, I grab a bottle of the hardest alcohol I can find, and I take a big slug when the screen flashes a bare butt or a naked chest.  This serves two purposes: not only do I find myself hammered in record time, I'm also able to use my drunkenness as an excuse if my buddies ever find out I've seen this crap.<br /><br />Sagal's acting makes the show worth two stars.  I give credit to where it's due, especially given that she doesn't have much to work with!)

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Ms. Donoghue tells the entire story from a child's point of view beginning around the age of five. It is a novel with a happy ending.

034580404X|1.0|I read all 3 \\"Fifty shades book\\" with the hope it would get better. Big mistake. Each was no better written than a harlequin romance, if you skip over the graphic sex scenes each book took no more than 2 hours to read. The characters were poorly `fleshed out' except for the main two. Then, those were barely described except for sexual `adventures.' The reader can instantly tell when the author broke out her thesaurus and tried to introduce a new word, as most of the book were on a High School writing level, except (hopefully) for the sex scenes.<br />  A major mistake in the first book was the issue of the car. Ana ay have been `given' the car but no where did she have to sign the title, get insurance, go to the court house and get tags. It just appeared and she drove it. Obviously it was NOT her car. And, even if it WAS hers, how could she afford the insurance on such a vehicle on her salary. A `college graduate' should have questioned this.<br />  At the end of the second book, Ana's former boss was mentioned to have a `photographic memory.' 20 seconds of research by the author would have shown that the term `photographic memory' is a misnomer. He may have had an \\"Eidetic Memory,\\" which is the proper term for the ability described in the book.

I enjoyed it but the ending sucked it was an awesome foreseen twist but it was to brief. And the book had her non-stop contemplation that would bore me from time to time. Other then that I enjoyed it

B007SGLZP8|3.0|I read The Racketeer and while I found it interesting and worthwhile, it lacks the Grisham page-turning suspense of many of his previous books, i.e., the Rainmaker, The Firm and his best novel, yet, A Tiime to Kill. Seems to me The Racketeer is a bit far-fetched and the characters are rather bland. This is not to say it doesn't have some interesting twists and turns and it left me with an upbeat feeling. Get the kindle version. It is not necessarily a volume you need to have on your library shelf.
B00008G7UF|4.0|good condition of the movie nothing special really nothing else that I can said, got home in a good time
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book...kept me interested the whole time..loved the characters and the plot..would recommend this to everyone!! I love the way the characters seem real and you can feel their emotion in the story..its like you are with them in the book feeling and seeing what they are!! love love love it!!
B0086449YA|4.0|If you like Mark Knopfler music you will like this album too. Not as good as Golden Heart or Sailing to Philadelphia, however it is a nice combination of Irish-Celtic, blues, country-folk music. Very enjoying and relaxing to listen, it has not &#34;hit like&#34; pieces. Should be part of any good music CD collection.

One of my alarms is &quot;Random by Artist&quot; - so it's a different Adele song each time. It's great for reminders as well as waking up. LOVE IT!!!

B008JJM88Q|5.0|The whole family has downloaded this one.  It's uncanny how Akinator can guess your characters (most of them anyway) with so few questions.  This one has been hours of fun.  Great to play around the dinner table.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There isn't much to say about this book that hasn't already been said. I purchased the book solely to see what all the hype was about. I couldn't put it down. It's dirty with a sensual twist and a plot. Loved it.
1607053888|5.0|I didnt let the four stars review of this book on the amazon website discourage me from buying it, i trust a lot on the product review but this time i wanted to take the risk... and it totally worth it. The projects are beautifull, creative, i love the step by step guide with pictures, and the levels on ecah project is a great guide to know where to start. I specially love the first pages, where Sue says that you shouldnt be very perfeccionist, its all about having fun and enjoying the procedure and the results, no matter what they are. The flower tutorials are also beautifull, and a wonderfull plus cause you can use them for other projects such as headbands or jewllery, i would definitly recomend this book, specially as a gift for someone who like me  is just discovering for the first time the magic of sewing
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn is definitely a talented writer.  She has woven together a tight web of details throughout this book and I applaud her efforts in putting this all together!!!!!  I wasn't sure that I would like the dialogue going back and forth from the male and female character every other chapter but in the end I appreciated knowing what they were both thinking simultaneously.  It certainly made for an interesting read and made me pay attention to many of the details that one would think to be small.  I do believe that readers figure this out sooner than later.  When you do reach the climax in this book you are ready for it but I was a tad bit disappointed in the ending.  Without giving it away, I basically said out loud - &#34;You've got to be kidding me!!!&#34;  I am considering some of her other books because of her style of writing but with respect to this particular book, it was really good.

B0059XTU1S|3.0|The Hobbit does seem to spend too much time in added scenes from Tolkein's appendices and in trying to connect The Hobbit to Lord of the Rings. Some will not mind this and even enjoy it. But it comes at the expense of getting around to telling the story of The Hobbit as told in the book.  There was an extended period in the first hour or so where I considered seriously walking out of the theater and not finishing the movie. It just simply seemed to not want to tell the tale of Bilbo Baggins. The film could easily have been retitled \\"The Dwarves\\" because that seemed to be the focus along with the emphasis on connecting it to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  The film gives Bilbo a great line at the end which finally gives him purpose and is heart warming. But takes the back seat to the Dwarves and the appendices material until the final act. I agree with the critics. The film feels bloated.<br /><br />There was no way I was not going to see this film in 48FPS HFR. Unfortunately my final verdict is that it probably hurt the presentation by sometimes hurting and sometimes helping. Which begs the question why see a film which sometimes looks great and sometimes looks kinda bad when you can see it look real good all the way through. Being there for history seems the best reason. But if you don't care about that see it in 2D 24 because this film suffers from the sense of watching it with sunglasses. Some 3D films do, some don't. But this one feels too gray with 3D glasses on. And I saw it in a magnificent IMAX 5K theater.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Great story, plays well on my Samsung Galaxy.  Would have given it a 5 star but for the fact that the time to go from scene to scene or into a tapped area is a little long.  Do recommend to those that like a good hidden object adventure

0316069434|2.0|I discovered Michael Connelly buy buying an old Harry Bosch book at a garage sale and was hooked.  I have since, read all of them in order and can say that right around Nine Dragons, they became extremely predictable with very few twists and turns.<br /><br />On a positive note, the book is very well written and it was a pleasure to read..... right up until the part a little more than half way through where I figured out what happened.  There were a few surprises towards the end, but they were all ancillary.  The main theme played out very predictably.<br /><br />This is an excellent airplane book or something for light reading, but I would skip it if you want to be mentally challenged by a murder mystery.

1610390938|4.0|I have no doubt that among economists this book merits all the praise it has received; I do NOT recommend it for the general reader, indeed, I do not recommend it at all unless it is assigned reading, in which case my recommendation is moot.  The book is neither as radical as its title pretends, nor as detailed as I was hoping for--how, exactly, do the one billion poor spend their 99 US cents a day?  I bought the book because I am thinking about how to persuade Sir Richard Branson that he should sponsor \\"The Virgin Truth\\" [one pager concept has been posted online]; go \\"all in\\" on all the Opens including Open Base Transceiver Station, Open Spectrum, Open Software, etcetera [topic of my most recent book], and give each of the five billion poor free cell phone access and free education \\"one cell call at a time\\" as conceptualized by the Earth Intelligence Network.  For me, this book is a four and not light reading.  All text, few charts, no lists, no comparatives, no visualization.<br /><br />The authors take one really brilliant idea and then talk around it, and that is why they lose one star.  The brilliant idea is that we really do need to understand at a micro level how the just under one billion extreme poor spend their 99 cents a day (the other four billion less poor live on $2 to $20 a day), and how they make their choices, choices that often reject tiny investments in prevention (chloriating their water, for example) with the result that they end of losing work and spending more on remediation after the fact.  YES!  I agree.  They then proceed to answer, at best, 20% of the question.<br /><br />The big take-away for me--I was absolutely delighted to see this message repeated throughout the book--was how a tiny bit of information can make a world of difference, both in the choice that an individual poor person makes, and in the eradication of corruption once detailed numbers are published about what *should* have reached each schoolhouse in any given district.  In other words, and this is NOT the key point of the book, but rather my key point: without changing a single institution, without redirecting a single dollar, the simple implementation of an information transparency regime changes everything.  Now THAT is a book I hope these two authors will write soon, and that book will probably join my 10% \\"Beyond 5 Stars.\\" [I read in 98 categories, just one of them fiction, access all my reviews and their Amazon pages by category at Phi Beta Iota, here ae just two:  Nature, Diet, Memetics, Design (206); Peace, Poverty, & Middle Class (253).<br /><br />The authors being and end their book, which pulls together hundreds of micro-surveys across fifteen years into one volume, and therefore a solid five for economists, with three words, all starting with I:  Ideology, Ignorance, and Inertia.  My three words are Ignorance (the poor); Corruption (the intermediaries); and Noncholance (by the Donors, including all the Specialized Agencies of the United Nations (also intermediaries), not a single one of which gives a hoot about the Secretary General's efforts to orchestrate \\"Deliver As One.\\"<br /><br />The book is divided into two parts, Part I is Private Lives and Part II is Institutions.  I confess to being disappointed by both parts, the first for lack of detail and the second for lack of specifics (related but not the same).  I do value the details that I do extract, including, for example:<br /><br />+  Poverty is not the same as hunger or starvation<br />+  Food is roughly 45-75% of all expenses, varying between rural and urban<br />+  Alcohol, tobacco, festivals including burials, and sugar are big items that do get bought<br />+  Food TASTE matters to the poor<br />+  Essentials, even at 99 cents a day, include a cell phone, TV, parabolic antenna, and even a DVD player<br />+  The indulgences, both big and small, are carefully thought through, not at all impetuous<br /><br />-  The lack of knowledge is CRITICAL -- about impact ofeducation on earnings, chlorine on diarrhea, iron supplements, vitamins<br />-  Unborn babies and the very young children are the center of gravity for life-long impact of aid if delivered<br /><br />OF NOTE (45):  According to one study, a child who grows up malaria free will earn 50% more per year, than one who does not, for life<br /><br />-  Traditional healers tends to be preferred by the poor to government doctors<br />-  The doctors are generally abysmal -- down in the bottom quartile<br />-  Doctors tend to under-diagnose and over-medicate<br />-  Government regulated delivery is extremely poor -- rules written by bureaucrats out of touch with reality<br /><br />+  Incentives do work -- a bag of beans for each immunization, a set of stainless steel plates for completing the series<br /><br />-  Kid drop out of school and too often are not learning anything from their rote schools<br />-  In India 50% of the teachers are not in front of a class when they are supposed to be<br />-  Huge waste in not having an early detection system for high performers<br /><br />+  Re-engineering education recommended -- forget the years of schooling across all subjects, focus on the basis (reading, writing, arithmetic) and let kids learn at their own pace<br /><br />-  Too few population planning programs understand social norms or the mechanics of getting to women in their homes, out of sight, without their husbands, in order to place the tools and the knowledge in their hands<br /><br />+  TV soap operas are a magnificent vehicle for changing social norms (e.g. encouraging smaller families, more child education), I myself am unaware of any global program to actively create such programs in the 183 languages that are still spoken by millions each.  This strikes me as something that could and should also be delivered to free cell phones if the daily power sourcing can be solved.<br /><br />+  Micro-delivery of anything via women is better.  There is much more detail that could have been provided here.<br /><br />Part II, although about Institutions, does continue to address the poor themselves.<br /><br />-  They bear 100% of the risk with no safety net -- weather, illness, anything can wipe them out<br />-  They do not understand nor have a provider of weather or crop or health insurance<br /><br />+  Their solution is to diversify their skill sets -- farm, bicycle taxi, other<br /><br />+  Micro-finance is a wonderful innovation but its rigid rules drive many of the poor to the traditional money lenders who charge up to 5% a DAY<br /><br />I am totally engrossed by the section on the various forms of lending available to the extreme poor, and the information implications.  The cost of validating a loan to a very poor person is too high for traditional institutions -- but imagine if they have a cell phone they cannot live without, and it provides all the locational, pattern analysis, contacts, and earnings information needed, and well as a precise location when the time comes to send in the eunuchs to show them their \\"package\\" (this was the only humor the authors offered in 305 pages).<br /><br />The authors discuss micro-saving as the next possible big thing among the one billion extreme poor, and they have me thinking about the role that a cell phone (with back up in the cloud) could play there.  The cost of setting up traditional bank accounts is too high -- the cost of having a cloud banking system -- to include remittances that comply with all anti-terrorism laws and offer good pattern analysis -- is not too high.<br /><br />The discussion of the disconnects between WHEN the poor have money, WHAT they buy, and the TIMING, is most interesting.  This is what an intelligence professional calls \\"requirements definition,\\" and it is clear through the book that most aid programs have not really gotten down to the level of detail that the authors have achieved -- but neither do the authors come out with a Banks & Textor type handbook, another worthy project that could cut across industry lines.  My own thinking on a Local to Global Range of Needs Table in the cloud is more on target.<br /><br />The section on entrepreneurship is very interesting, and has me thinking about how we might combine a free cell phone, a village information cloud, a commitment to Open Source Everything (e.g. show them how to create the Open Farm set of technologies), and a commitment to train ONE villager in every micro-task that a village needs, across agriculture, energy, water, health, etcetera.  There is so much more we can all do and frankly I consider the Specialized Agencies and their inattentive donors a major part of the problem -- no one is holding these people accountable for failure, just as we are not holding our governments accountable for spending 1.3 trillion a year on war when I can eradicate the ten high level threats to humanity for one third that cost if made available each year for ten years.  [See Medard Gabel's graphic, am posting it above with the cover of the book.]<br /><br />The discussion of institutions really does lack specificity, and I can only assume the authors are trying very hard not to offend.  Me, I like to throw grenades in the door and talk to the survivors, if any, or start fresh with people that are not totally trapped in the old paradigms.  It is clear that all of the aid institutions are both ignorant and corrupt, and I specifically include the Red Cross, which is now notorious for collecting hundreds of millions for Katrina or Haiti, and then delivering less than 20% -- or in Bono's case, 1% at best.<br /><br />Clear to me is that we need to change the rules of the donation game.  I would like to see total transparency required of all aid organizations, in real time, day after day, and any Specialized Agency that fails to meet that transparency requirement, and fails to be certified by the Secretary General for being in harmony with the Millenium and other High-Level goals, starved to death.  Cut them off and let them die.  The authors provide a couple of very exciting examples from Uganda, of corruption before information transparency, and accountability afterward, and I am absolutely certain of two things [which I briefed to a UNICEF Conference, look for Steele Open Everything UNICEF]:<br /><br />01.  80% of the rich do not donate to charity now, we can get them to donate one thing to one family at a time if we create a global online Local to Global Range of Needs Table that is fed from the bottom up, that allows individuals to come together (one reports the spare part need for a Rumanian water pump from the 1950's, a Rumanian engineer offers to build the part, a German pays for FedEx, etc]<br /><br />02.  If we focus on bottom up requirements and global transparency of needs, donations, and efficacy by individual and organization, we will stop wasting 50% or more of the existing funds channeled via institutions both non-profit (hah hah) and governmental.<br /><br />In other words, we are long over-due for an information revolution in the global economy, starting with the one billion poorest.<br /><br />The authors conclude with five points, I won't spoil their ending, but will observe that all five points are points that can be implemented with an information revolution.<br /><br />The notes are superb, there is no bibliography and that is another reason for four stars.  While I read the notes -- on 6 star books I read the notes first -- I consider a professional bibliography an absolutely essential feature for any book, shame on all concerned for not providing one for this book.<br /><br />Now here are ten links for other books, I have written a summary review of each at Amazon with a mirror accessible by category at Phi Beta Iota the Public Intelligence Blog.<br /><br />Down and Dirty Real Life of the Poor [Apologies that the books are US centric]<br />[[ASIN:1566635055 Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass]]<br />[[ASIN:0674030710 Off the Books: The Underground Economy of the Urban Poor]]<br />[[ASIN:0312626681 Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America]]<br />[[ASIN:0375708219 The Working Poor: Invisible in America]]<br />[[ASIN:0812971841 Nobodies: Modern American Slave Labor and the Dark Side of the New Global Economy]]<br /><br />Big Picture Books I have reviewed [a fraction, I am only allowed five more links]:<br />[[ASIN:0415953367 An Atlas of Poverty in America: One Nation, Pulling Apart 1960-2003]]<br />[[ASIN:0973714700 The Globalization of Poverty and the New World Order]]<br />[[ASIN:0470098287 The Global Class War: How America's Bipartisan Elite Lost Our Future - and What It Will Take to Win It Back]]<br />[[ASIN:0452287081 Confessions of an Economic Hit Man]]<br />[[ASIN:0853459916 Open Veins of Latin America: Five Centuries of the Pillage of a Continent]]<br /><br />I've read Prahalad, Farmer, etcetera, the authors cite them all so I have used my choices above to be of greater use to the non-economist seeking more readable volumes.

1451695195|1.0|I give this a one star, cautiously.  The only thing I liked about this book was the point he made several times that God is all-loving.  That we are loved more than we can imagine.  That I agree with completely.  And I certainly appreciate how this knowledge changed the way he felt about himself as an adopted child.  However, as a Christ-follower, this book is horrendously off.  I have never had an NDE myself (obviously), so I don't mean to undermine what he experienced.  But I cannot place what he experienced with what I know to be true of the Bible's description of Heaven and Hell.  I don't think there will be any traveling between, into and out of, etc...  And I really disliked his openness to a medium reaching out to him.  Creepy.  I did not see anything in here that would have made me believe in Heaven, if I weren't already a Christian.  And this book leaves WAY too much room for people to interpret HOW we get to heaven:  through a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, our Savior.  He never once mentioned anything about his own personal relationship with Jesus.  He talked around \\"Om\\" and \\"Creator\\"  and \\"Divine.\\"  All this to say, this book does not do what its title says.  Read this with appreciation for his experience, but filter out all the non-Biblical babble.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|Major Frank Carden (Morgan Freeman) is the leader of a group of well paid hitmen. His job takes his to Washington state. Through a series of events, his trip is interrupted and rescue attempt is botched.<br /><br />Ray Keene (John Cusack) is going camping with his son (Jamie Anderson) for a much needed bonding trip. Playing the good Samaritan, Ray gets caught in the middle of the events, finding himself on the run with a handcuffed Morgan being followed by heavily armed bad guys who are being tracked by the good guys...but the bad guys have never seen a John Cusack film and don't know what a school teacher, wanting to bond with his son, is capable of doing.<br /><br />The acting was good, even if the plot was weak. The film has a twist, but nothing to write home about. Might work for an action flick rental. Not on my keeper shelf.<br /><br />Parental Guide: Couple of rare F-bombs, no sex, rear nudity (Megan \\"cute tush\\" Dodds)
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play it all the time,easiest game to use of the ones chosen......You ask for too many words,would only be redundant to add more...lol
0763650447|5.0|I am a speech-language pathologist and my toddlers and prek kids just love this book.  The pictures are so colorful and there's lots of language concepts to learn.  The story also lends itself beautifully  to signing and the kids just love throwing kisses at the end and of course raising their hands high in the air when we say \\"HOORAY FOR FISH\\"!
B00979CS50|5.0|Dear Neil & the Real Deal<br />we love you guys !!!<br />thanks for keeping the dream alive - the musicman  & friends
B002VECM6S|5.0|great price and fast shipping. my daughter gave me a list of movies she wanted. this was so much easier than going to look in stores for each movies. thanks
0345803493|5.0|The first book was good, and this one just continued on from it.  I have just finished it and ready to read the last in the series.  I thought it was nice fun reading
B0062NAX1U|5.0|great price and fast shipping. my daughter gave me a list of movies she wanted. this was so much easier than going to look in stores for each movies. thanks
B0026P3G12|5.0|This was a gift from my hubby.  It arrived in tact, on time, and was all I hoped it would be.
B0098VXE50|5.0|It was GREAT!!! Watched it numerous times so far., Love it.....Kristen was great in this movie., as was the rest of the case can't wait for the sequel, with Kristen and rest of cast. :)
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Very nice to add to the Christmas music collection.  Good solid Rod Stewart covering classic favorites and some nice duets.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Tina, I'm a huge fan, but I thought that this book became very boring once you get past the childhood awkwardness stage.
1935251740|4.0|Extremely interesting book!  How do you merge George Berkeleys idealism (does a tree falling in a forest makes a noise if you are not there: answer: not), with stem cell research, and quantum physics, well, he does it very well. Fascinating.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I am still laughing. You will not be disapointed.  Tom Cruise was unbelieveable. The whoe cast was great. However if you are a pc person. This may not be for you
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Music android facebook app works better than kindle fire app. Need to update it!!! The app should be just like the one you have on your computer.
B005LAIHYU|2.0|this movie was NOT as good as the book was!!!!  I wasn't blown away by it.  if you read the book DON'T waste your time watching this movie because it is not at all true enough to the books greatness!!!  very disappointed...hope they do a remake and actually follow the books story!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun and additive game. Anyone of any age would enjoy this game. I like it so much that I have it downloaded to my phone as well.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|About 6 or 7 years ago, this was practically the first Disney 2D movie i had seen, it was, has, and will be my favorite 2D animated movie. 6-7 years later here i am end of first semester for mister senior me, and i still have emotions and love for this movie (to tell the truth i showed more emotions toward it now than when i was a kid). I could easily consider this a classic and should never even be forgotten.<br /><br />Its's like \\"Ohana\\" to me (get it.)<br /><br />Also i would like to add further towards the lesser things that came after this movie. They are ok, but the show in some areas ruins the series and i recently watched clips of Leroy and stitch; heavily disappointing. I think that if there is ever a possible 3rd movie, the animation and art style should go back to its original movie, unlike the second movie promised.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|For years I wandered time and space alone, unaided, and incredibly bored. I thought to myself, &#34;You know, my life could be a little more sonic.&#34; So I dashed to my TARDIS console and got on the TARDIS wifi to order myself a screwdriver. Not just any screwdriver, mind you. A sonic screwdriver, complete with lights, sounds, and moving components that would make even a Time Lord get all wibbly-wobbly in the knees. My only complaint?<br /><br />It doesn't do wood.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This is probably one of the best concert movies I've ever seen. Adele herself has said it was her favorite show she's ever done. The look of the Blu-ray is excellent and the sound too. I'm so happy I purchased this. Any Adele fan should own it.
0307450570|5.0|This book is huge and amazing and has more projects than somebody could ever make in a lifetime...except of course Martha.  There are things I'd never even heard of and so many that I've always wanted to make.  I think the pictures and instructions are incredibly detailed and I love it.
B000001FFJ|5.0|An excellent introduction to the world of Tom Waits' music. Walking Spanish brought me here but Cemetery Polka, Singapore, and many more keep me coming back.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I am the mother of two daughters and had a mother myself, so i understand this movie completely!!  It is not always easy to do what is expected of you by a mother who wants only the best for her daughter.  It is not easy to have a different idea of where you want your life to go than your mother.  So this is about a girl who is struggling to be herself and find out who she is and who makes some mistakes and hurts those she loves.  She realizes in the end, how much she loves her mother and how much her mother loves her.  I thought the graphics were beautiful.  I thought Merida was a saucy and fun heroine.  I loved that she didn't just marry someone in the end.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Loved it, kept me reading from beginning to end, could't put it down looking forward to reading the next two.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|This movie did quite well in what it needed to do which is:  turn a couple of kids who just wander around the woods for the bulk of the book into a movie.  If you are a fan of this series, this is a must for your collection, it isn't as good as part 2 which has all the action though.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I just got the gun today for Christmas and it was awesome. I had a hard time putting it together but I just spent a whole hour playing it.  It was heavy for me but it was awesome. It was very cheat on amazon;the one from toysrus was fourth-five bucks man!<br /><br />Anyway, it is cheap and a must buy nerf gun
B002RVCD6O|4.0|This isn't one of my favorite books, but I think they do quite well in the movie to make it entertaining.  It's quite dark, so I wouldn't let any kids under 10 watch it.
B00917IQFY|5.0|These guys are 30+ years older, more seasoned, more mature.  The album didn't bowl me over at first (I received my copy during the first week of release), but it grew on me quickly. Now, I'm listening to it constantly.  The musicianship is so very fine, the lyrics sharp, tempered with wisdom, leavened with wit and humor. I've been following GP from his first days with the Rumour, all throughout his solo career, up to today, and this album is a new high mark for him and the band. Songs that I particularly like include \\"Snake Oil Capitol of the World\\" (with its hint of reggae), \\"Three Chords Good,\\" \\"Old Soul,\\" and \\"Live in Shadow.\\" It's wonderful listening to such wonderful musicians playing so well together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Haven't been able to put all 3 of these books down. I do have say I was a little confused in the 3rd book and felt like it needed a different ending. Can't wait to see the two movies when they come out.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|This is a cute take on a Christmas movie.  My kids really enjoyed it, and it wasn't too bad for an adult to watch, either.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I believe Daniel Craig is the best Bond of them all.  This is the most realistic Bond movie ever.  If you like to see Bond get dirty while performing all those heroic feats, yet maintain the sauve persona, this movie is for you!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Fantastic album! Love the songs. I have played it many times already. Susan Boyle is a lady with an amazing voice. I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys hearing the words to a song sung, not screamed at the top of the lungs.
B00A23MYCC|1.0|I expected it to be crude...actually I was hoping that it would blow my mind with how crude and funny it was. Well, it was crude but not funny at all.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I absolutely love this woman's voice. She has an amazing command and control of her voice and it is a pleasure to listen to. I have it in my disk drive and turn it on when I am not doing something with sound that I have to pay attention to. It makes my day. I am very happy with it and would recommend it to a friend.
0470913029|3.0|Basic info that answered most of my questions about the Paleo diet. Layout of cooking/recipe sections are difficult to maneuver through. I would have liked to have seen pictures of the finished dish.
B009K45Y62|3.0|The Dark Knight Rises was the epic conclusion to Nolan's Batman Franchise. As a fan and owner of the first two movies on special edition DVD's, i couldn't hesitate when this limited edition came out which boasts of its Blu Ray \ DVD combo with Ultraviolet Digital copy.<br /><br />I got my package - Limited Edition 25,413 of 35,000 and opened it up. In the set I received 3 Discs.<br />First - The Dark Knight Rises - DVD Disc<br />Second - The Dark Knight Rises - Special Features Disc<br />Third - The Dark Knight Rises - Special Features Disc.<br /><br />Yup. Its not a typo error. I actually received two special features discs instead of the Blu Ray copy. Apart from the limited edition packaging of this set, i was looking forward to having Batman on Blu Ray, but this isn't an option.<br /><br />The Ultraviolet &#34;Digital Copy&#34; - As others would have already mentioned, this is in no way a Digital Copy. Its just a code to online storage of TDKR. You are unable to download your copy and use it through iTunes. I am an avid movie collector and a lot of the movies i order here on amazon, i look forward to the digital copies. This ultraviolet version is not worth it and in my opinion it could never replace a physical digital copy.<br /><br />It is with the missing Blu Ray disc and the Lack of Digital Copy that i give this package just 3 stars.
B00A3VLJCE|3.0|All of the gadgets show up too large and out of place on the Galaxy Note 2. This prevents you from doing even the first tutorial. Lots of features cannot even be selected due to this. But the features that are&nbsp;accessible work amazingly.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is an amazing series.  I had gotten behind but Amazon allowed me to get caught up easily and inexpensively
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it and it is absolutely great just for me but it is fun for everyone! Once I had my almost 2 year old cousin play it and she likes it too.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Glad we waited for stock available at MSRP ($34.99). This will be the icing on the  cake for our minecraft addicts at Christmas.  For those that paid 3-4 times msrp, shame on you.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|very good mystery game, it actually gave me goosebumps at one point. highly recommend this game if you are into this sort of thing
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I love the emotion behind this novel. Kelly is amazing at describing the characters feelings to the point where you KNEW them.<br /><br />The reason why I gave Waking Up Married  three stars because  of the cliché topic it focused on. Waking up married after a night in Vegas? We've heard this a thousand times. I just felt she used and already overdone topic and she didn't do well at making it unique.
B0085P2Z6E|1.0|This could be fun, but doesn't work!  If you pinch to zoom, it sometimes penalizes you 20 seconds for random taps.  Other times, even if you select the right item, it doesn't recognize it.  Click again on the right item--oops!--another 20 second penalty for &quot;random&quot; taps.  Not worth the bother.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|If you like the 80's You will like this movie. Everyone does an excellent job and the way they sang all of the songs were unique.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|The quality is without question worth the price of admission! For anyone who does not have complete collection, this is the ideal way to hear all the timeless music on the best format (vinyl) on the market today!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game you should get it you can play a lot of different mini games on it thanks for listening if you have fun if you fey this game my favorite game is boucer but it gets boring at the same time
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is an awesome game.....very good so far. I like changing how my stickman looks. Definitely worth the money! I hope there are more games like it in the future.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|such a cute and addicting game!!! I love it!!! the graphics and gameplay are amazing!!! I wish they had put voices for all of the ponies though... :/
0307719774|5.0|I love this book...I love that I can still &#34;journal&#34; everyday with the little time I have in my day...I look forward to seeing how my answers will change year after year. Great gift Idea or a treat for yourself!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|rather mindless entertainment, but fun.  the physics engine is pretty awesome.  not too add laden, and you are not forced to use $$$ to play, unless you want to play all day.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Basic hidden object game, with some very simple puzzles. The story and writing are somewhat stilted. But I'm enjoying it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This turned out to be pretty good but for me it took way to long to get going. I was ready to give up on it and then around 10 or 11 chapters in it got really good.  Loved the action, it was every intense.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Love it.  The best of the &#34;Vacation&#34; movies.  I watch it every year and it hold up well.  Not so sure about the Blu-ray version yet, I need to watch it a few times to see if it is really worth the extra $$$
B007TXN4TK|4.0|This game is fun for both young and old. I always wanted to play the piano, this is as close as I'll ever come lol
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I love search games made by G5 Entertainment. The graphics are outstanding and the story interesting.  The game itself is just challenging enough. Great quality game. Keep'em coming!
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Good deal on black friday.  I have to type 15 more words so Its a good movie...its a good movie.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is the best serial show on TV.  It's not preachy or trying to teach a lesson.  Just good escapism entertainment
0743454537|5.0|I ordered it for someone else who likes this kind of fiction writing and that person has loved reading it as many of Picoult's novels!
B007WCJSWA|4.0|La totalidad del material es exelente, no hay desperdicios. La colección de artistas que se hacen cita para grabar el disco son de primera linea. Muy recomendado.
0061353248|4.0|It helps much to show how our minds work but it failed to show a) the reasons for it which are also rational in view of human weakness and b) the ways to improve.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It would be better if they put in flint and steel in creative mode and after you die in survival mode you get no more enemies. Other wise awesome.
B00A77II0U|5.0|an excellent game with agood storyline!  I thoroughly. enjoyed. playing. it. only regret was I finished!  more like this one.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Awesome book<br />2nd best book I've read the first is the third wheel<br />Jeff Kinney is the best author ever!
0439023483|5.0|excellent  they meet all my expectations  I can recommend this product to others read is a good habit thank you
B00006CXSS|5.0|I've always loved war movies. Specially WWII movies. There's something about that time I feel deeply connected to. I first heard about Band of Brothers on Facebook. At first I was too busy to give it a try but I am so happy i finally watched the show.<br />It is the most amazing show I have ever seen in my life. The whole thing is so real and believable that you feel that you, yourself are a soldier in the war and you suffer with them, cry with them, feel with them.<br />They are true heroes. Not made up like Captain America or Batman. This is their real story. It makes you think that without people like these, we wouldn't be where we are today. Truly magical! Watch this and you won't regret it! My favorite show to watch, i honeslty watch it all the time.
0439023513|5.0|excellent  they meet all my expectations  I can recommend this product to others read is a good habit thank you
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Disney got it right a great story not to scary for younger children.  I skip the first 5 minutes and love the reaction to the Hawaiian language and culture.  Not just a childs story a valid message for all.  Color and the songs are magic. Aloha
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|good story line. its got hidden object and other puzzles along with it. keeps you busy for hours. I enjoy it.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|There was little character development so they ended up seeming wooden and clumsy.  The events were not well developed; it was more like a report than novel!
630587493X|5.0|This is a thought provoking film.  It has all elements skillfuly blended into a believable senario that mays you laugh, cry, and most of, believe it is possible.
0525478817|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read. It was not what I had expected even though I read many reviews on different websites. Despite being sad and depressing, this book is full of hope, which made it so beautiful. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. If only all of us were so lucky to find a Gus in our lives, the world would be a much happier place.
0143116371|5.0|I'm a fan of the blog. This will make a good coffee table book, but for now is sitting next to my bed for a little daily inspiration.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Sound quality not that great. I would give the movie itself a 4/5 just that the sound was not what I expected it to be.
B009WJ2XT6|4.0|I really like this score, but agree with all reviewers who made this point: the theme song for the film should be included. While no one goes to a Bond movie just for the theme song, it's almost comparable to the Super Bowl commercials: you watch the game for the game, of course, but it's not the same if the commercials suck. I love Bond films. Not including the Bond theme song in the soundtrack is a complete rip off.
0385535147|5.0|I have not had time to read this book yet but after the holidays my nose will be stuck in the book. I look forward to reading this book.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I am a huge Bond fan, though I don't go in for movie-related books so much as the films themselves. I consider Daniel Craig to be the best of the Bonds, simply because he embodies the physicality of the role in a way that none of the others could match. Suave means nothing if you have to have a fight with the mark you're following, and Craig can do both. I felt that this film was perfectly paced, and the details from past movies not so much an homage to the past as a nod to it while establishing definitively that this franchise is going in a new direction, the past and the future equally recognized. I think this is the best subtlety in the movie, and for all his personal failings Sam Mendes was a fantastic choice for director. I've seen it twice in theater and will probably go to see it at least once more. Watching this film was like drinking a fine wine. The visuals were breathtaking and the plot tightly wound, although Berenice was walking around the premiers like the cat that got the cream when her role really wasn't big enough to justify her strutting. This is a film where the Bond girls, though needed for the plot (esp. Naomi Harris), weren't as much a part of the action as we've seen in the past (i.e. the train wreck of Denise Richards in The World is Not Enough). The weaknesses of these girls were recognized in the film and each girl's role played to the strengths of the characters, if that makes sense. But at the end of the day, the center of this film was James Bond, and Daniel owns every scene he's in. Even Javier Bardem, quite possibly the creepiest villian of them all, can equal but not outmatch Mr. Craig.<br /><br />This movie is worth every single penny, several times over. I have never been so entertained by a Bond film.
0385532458|5.0|Another great book from John Grisham. This book includes several short stories which are page turners in the Grisham way. Loved the book
B001EN71CW|5.0|The ballad of Serenity and Firefly is already the stuff of legend -- only 14 episodes were actually filmed and fewer yet were actually aired before the show was cancelled. However after cancellation it achieved cult status and saw very healthy sales. This Blu-ray edition has all filmed episodes including unaired episodes of Firefly. The picture quality is good but not outstanding.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We saw this movie and the theatre and my boyfriend could not wait to get it on DVD when it came out to complete his collection. We always buy Blu-ray combos because we have a Blue-Ray player but his dad does not and we give him the DVD copy. Win-win.
0307891372|3.0|my son was excited but it took FOREVER to arrive. I could've just purchased brand new at the local GameStop for a couple of dollars more
B00005JMXX|5.0|I have had no problems with this product. I love it and arrived as described. I definitely would buy it again.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|is great movie , is funny  and i love this film , your actors , gizmo and the gremlins .
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I'm a sci fi nut and really enjoyed this movie. A lot of people have given it bad reviews, but I liked it.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I'm not sure why all of the negative feedback on this.  My boys got this for their birthday on December 1st and have literally played with it at least twice a day ever since.  They GET ALONG when they play it, too, which is rare.  I have a 4 year old and 7 year old.  They love the Angry Birds on the Kindle Fire but this actually holds their interest just as long.  It doesn't have too much educational value but it does teach patience, gross motor skills and I guess a bit about physics if you want to get technical lol.  They also use the set just to pretend play and give the \\"Birds\\" and \\"Pigs\\" a personality.  I'm glad no one read the reviews before getting them this because it has become one of their favorite birthday presents.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I have had no problems with this product. I love it and arrived as described. I definitely would buy it again.
0553801473|4.0|A bit of a constantly scene changing soap opera, and with too much violence combined with sex which is my definition of pornography. However, occasionally there is real writing and a compelling narrative and depth of character. This lifts the book on its ascent to literature, but it rarely gets off the genre ground. By this book we have so much invested in the Starks, it's difficult to climb back down the mountain to avoid the melodramatic avalanches to come and pervasive indifference to the fates of the small folk. And we are often left with a smoldering need for vengeance which goes against what should be our better instincts. It is a very brutal world and its deep structure, the gods and magics remain occulted.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This game has great puzzles and it doesn't get old. The story line is pretty fun to follow along too.
B000001GK0|5.0|I was very pleased with this CD and I would recommend it for others.  The sound is good and the artists capture the spirit of the work.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|Bought this movie for my wife, as it's one of her all-time favorites. The blu-ray delivers, best quality we've ever seen.<br /><br />This movie has an awesome soundtrack as well, and it really comes through. Great feel good movie for the holidays!
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than the other popular series out there. Good story that keeps you wanting more. Can't wait for the next book to be released.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I found that this book was one of the best in the series. This was my first wimpy kid book on a kindle, and it seemed quite short for me. Overall though, I found this a great book for the young reader and even the average middle school student.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I'm really glad I just decided to buy this cd, because the music on it is fantatsic. I really wanted 1 song, the Christini Perri song, but the rest are really great as well. I'm discovering new artists because of this cd!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|wonderful  it is is is is isi is isi si is is is is is is the best gift ever
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its all ways been so good and make my picture a lot better for an ipad some times its slow though but that's the only bad part so if I were you I WOULD get this app it one of the best
B0006GQMC8|5.0|Have always liked this movie and am very happy to have the DVD now I can watch Death Hunt as often as I like.
B0057567P0|3.0|It works but is a little wanky. It needs to be plugged in when the computer starts up to be recognized. Once started up you can remove and put it back in, but must be in on start up. Also doesn't work with the Sonnet Echo, which is annoying but luckily Sony updated their sxs drivers to work with thunderbolt now. Speed is solid, even when going to two drives at same time.
0393088774|3.0|Professor Krugman's argument is the government needs to spend its way out of this depression. He emphasizes the loss of jobs resulting in, of course, monetary loss but also esteem and future earnings potential of the young.<br /><br />Unfortunately, government cannot be efficient nor spend money wisely..<br /><br />The most efficient sector of business is the small business. Why not have them spend the money? Why not subsidize (or pay for) health benefits? Subsidize training via small business to have people live to their potential?<br /><br />Rather than enriching the top 1%, small business can distribute the wealth much more evenly.
B004W4N55C|1.0|Crahes on Nexus 10 when entering search...please fix. App does not work, not acceptable. I think app in google play has been fixed a long time ago
B000HKW7E0|5.0|One of my top holiday classics.  If you are looking for a Christmas movie but do not want to drag down by emotion and sentiment, this is your best choice!
B009AVCAJ4|5.0|I see alot of misinformation being spread on here about Ninja Scroll being originally formatted in widescreen, that is simply not the case.  The movie was always in 4x3 format, even when it originally was seened in movie theaters in Japan.<br /><br />On to the Blu-ray, the movie has never looked better, you see a level of detail that wasn't seened in previous releases.<br /><br />All in all, a must buy.<br /><br />Sentai Filmworks did a excellent job with this release, and  hopefully they can get the license to Vampire Hunter D, and Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust and put those on Blu-ray as well.
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|This is not my genre of interest.  But, I have to say that I agree with everyone else who loved the book.  It was engaging and memorable.  The prose was beautiful and thought provoking. The plot was intriguing. I wish I could say that I'd like to read more books like this; however, there is only one William Boyd.<br /><br />If you're not sure about this book--take a chance!  With 44 happy, satisfied customers . . . how can you go wrong?
1781163243|5.0|An in depth and comprehensive collection of concept art, finished models and behind the scene imagery that should not be missed by any true Halo fan.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|It does just what you'd expect.  Syncs well, easy to read format.  Better than some 3rd party alternatives I have tried.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft, but I thought I could play with random people. I WAS WRONG! You can only play multiplayer if u have the same wifi. They also need to put more items. If you like survival craft you might like this because u can pretty much play alone. You are only in creative mode (lame) and there isn't much to do. I would like to give it five stars if u could play online with friends. I feel like I wasted my money in some ways.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The search notifications for this app are great.  I have found with my Samsung Galaxy S phone that I have to have 3G turned on, as opposed to jus wifi, in order to save a search that I created from the phone.  There have been no problems with searches created via the computer showing up as expected on the phone.<br /><br />you can program how much notice you want that an auction is ending, so it's easy to keep on top of something you are determined to have.
B008M87GJK|3.0|This is okay, but it doesn't seem to offer much more functionality than CNN or BBC on the web for example. I am not too keen on applications that connect to the web on their own.
B000SW2ER2|5.0|A beautiful movie. I loved it from first frame to last. No, it does not really compare to the original, which is more about the strange situation, which is ultimately unresolved. This one is more of a character piece, very emotional. And although I have never been a big fan of George, he is great here. In my opinion, he's better in a dramatic role like this.<br /><br />At any rate, he plays a psychologist who is asked by a friend to investigate the very strange happenings aboard a spaceship orbiting a planet called \\"Solaris.\\" It appears as though the captain of the vessel has gone mad. Different from the original story, but not substantially so.<br /><br />Upon arriving, George's character finds the crew either noticeably disturbed (as in the case of the very creepy Jeremy Davies), or just dead, as in the case of the unfortunate captain. One of the crew refuses to allow him to enter her quarters, obviously hiding something, and he finds bloods streaks and trails.<br /><br />When Clooney's character finally succumbs to sleep, he discovers the reason for their apparent madness -- somehow, in this place, dreams become a kind of reality, and the obsessions of the crew somehow become physical entities. George's character, for example, dreams of his dead fiance, and there she is, apparently alive and well.<br /><br />The crux of the story involves the nature of these beings. Are they real? duplicates of the originals? ghosts? Or just tricks Solaris is playing in a kind of attempt to communicate? And ultimately, as far as George's character is concerned, does it really matter? He seems to have a second chance at the girl of his dreams. So what will he do with it?<br /><br />One of the most striking scenes in the movie is when Clooney's character, still rational, abandons the first version of his dreamgirl to the vastness of outer space. Does she really float out there indescribably lonely until death, or only until she is far enough away from Solaris for the mysterious link to be severed? We never find out, but it's a very powerful scene. I loved it.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jeremy Davies is at his best, playing the nutbag to perfection. Impossible to not get a little creeped out by his performance.<br /><br />Overall, I have to say that while the original Solaris was pretty much forgettable,  this newer version is anything but. It understands what works best about the original concept and builds on it -- mostly due to the director, I bet. Anyway, I loved it. One of my all-time favorite science fiction movies.
B007V65R54|5.0|This book present plenty of reasons why we had a financial crisis, but it does it in a way which is easy to read and enjoyable (apart from the outrage about some of the big players that it may cause).
B005KELQEU|3.0|I use it to protect screen, which it does. I would like a note card pocket or two and a pocket for usb cable
B00004RF98|5.0|The best ever classic musical movie -- Gene Kelly, Debbie Reynolds, Jean Hagen, Donald O'Conner.  How can you miss?  It doesn't matter if you've seen it before. See it again and again.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Another great Christmas cd from the Glee crew.  Nice to hear new renditions of some of the greatest classics ... some of the old versions needed to be spiced up anyways.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love that the author wrote out of the norm for romance and made her heroine so real. Good job
B005DF2QMC|3.0|I'm looking again for my NEW laptop so I can use this device in connection with it.  I ordered a laptop new but I was sent a refurbished computer from deal2u; may now be named jays_DVDS; since that is name now attached to the laptop I had ordered and was advertising new (and still is advertising as new).  I now have to wait on resolution of that issue or acquisition of new laptop to test this device out and I was hoping to use it to digitize Christmas tapes of 30 years ago and give them to my children this Christmas.

0345472322|5.0|This book has the potential to be a life changer. It far exceeds the standards of a Self Help book in that it is based on years of research and includes directions about how to use the author's conclusions. Carol Dweck is an excellent researcher whose work I began reading years ago. She definitely knows whereof she speaks. In addition, the book is a good read.<br /><br />Don Welti, Ph.D.
B00979CS50|5.0|The subject line says it all. The ending was a mind twist. Neal is the real deal. A hippie dream.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|It's a great quirky movie for your gremlin fan. Get both, makes great Xmas gifts under the tree this year.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I realize it's harder to impress us with dazzeling special effects to compensate for the lack of  an original story but this was just not very entertaining to me. Not bad really just not impressive.

B008J34466|5.0|One of her best so far. Pink is not an artist I like when she first started out. I wasn't a fan of those teen stars, but I have to say I love how this artist has grown now only personally in her life but also as an artist. The album before this 'Fun House' was recommended by my best friend and it didn't disappoint. When I saw the reviews for this album in People, I came home and ordered it the same day and it has not disappointed. I recommended it to my best friend. It like the previous album is one you can listen to for years to come.
