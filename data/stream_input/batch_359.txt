B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney might win the young crowd over, but for anyone who has any clue about her singing talent, she is old news. With each album she does, her vocals get weaker and weaker. Take away the background vocals and all you would hear is a very weak, nasal sounded duck. I have nothing against Britney, but her vocals are terrible. She covers herself up with background singers and lets them do all the work. If you see her live, you can't even hear her sing, her microphone is turned down twice as low as everyone else who sings. I don't know what has happened to her voice, but it does not even compare to Avril, Pink or Christina.
B00005B36H|5.0|Only Tool could make an album like this. To be more specific, only Maynard could. The main theme of the album is advise about life. Maynard tell us that we shouldn't waste our lifes fighting and to just enjoy it for every second you breathe. Tool's mesmerizing intrumentals and vocals combine to make a sound I have never heard any other band come close to. The song Schism is a song about how relationships are broken between people. I guess because Tool's main goal was to prove that metal music can be different, they tryed to make this basic song topic as complicated as possible. Anyway, I basically worship all the somgs on this album but my favorites are Reflection, Parabola, Disposition, The Patient, and Schism.
0446677450|2.0|This book does do one thing...pumps you up.  However, Kiyosaki cannot support any of the claims he has made.  Do some research on the internet and compare this book to some of his other books and you will find many inconsistencies in his life story and outrageous claims.  Or better yet, go to [...] and look at his analysis of the book.  He's done all the work for you!  It is extremely interesting, especially after you've read the book!  <br />For anyone who is interested in financial freedom, I recommend researching authors before their buying books and then decide who you believe is crediable.  I wish I would have learned this a few years ago...I would have save a lot of money!<br />There are a lot of good sources out there.  I have read about countless books and articles on financial success over the past three years...many good and many bad.  This book is certainly one of the most interesting...but don't look to it for real answers.  There's none here.
B00000JCOV|5.0|I've listened to this album over and over again and it still is awesome to listen to! Got an agression inside you that you need an outlet for? Listen to this album (I'm listening to it right now)! I'm not rating every song in particular because they all kick a$$...but my favorites in particular are Scissors, Prosthetics, Purity, Wait and Bleed, and Eyeless. It took me awhile to get into the album, but when I finally did, I couldn't stop listening to it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I can't pull up the 5.1 mix either on my JVC XV-D723GD DVD Audio player. The DVD Audio light comes on, and everything is fine, but no audio. Still, even if heard through a tin can, this album will always be wonderful.
0966638328|5.0|I have this book at work. It is indespensible. I am buying it for my home. I think I need a copy for every desk I am ever at. This book is amazing with its themes. Turn to a theme like &quot;calm&quot;, and the left side of the page will have ads and pictures showing how these evoke a calming effect. Then on the right, there's pantone groups with a main color, secondary, and accent. This book is a must-have for graphic designers and even people who do web design. It is the first book I refer to at work when I need inspiration.
0783226063|1.0|DO NOT, I REPEAT DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!!!!  GET JOHN HARRISON'S WONDEROUS ADAPTATION!!!!!!  IF YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO SEE THIS TRASH, WAIT FOR IT TO COME ON THE SCIFI CHANNEL!!!!!!  AND WORSE YET THEY HAD PATRICK STEWART ON THE CAST, THE ONLY ACTOR IN HOLLYWOOD WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO CORRECTLY PORTRAY DUKE LETO ATREIDES, AND INSTEAD HAD THE MAN, WHO SCREAMS OF LEADERSHIP QUALITIES, PLAY GURNEY HALLECK, WHO IS BASICALLY A GLORIFIED THUG!!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I received this CD as a gift from one of my friend.  This cd is very disappointing.  WHY?  Because it's all created by the studio.  Britney Spears cannot sing, and so the studio mixers did all that they can to create whatever pieces of her voice into songs.  What else is very disapointing is that Britney Spears says that this cd is a re-invention of herself, through writing her own lyrics and having matured over the couple of years she has been on a break, but apparently it is a sad attempt.  Her music is the same, the lyrics have no significance at all.  And Britney goes on bragging about how she has wrote a song dealing with self pleasure called &quot;my touch&quot;(something like that), and she says she is original? Well, there has already been a song called &quot;I touch myself&quot; back in the 80's Britney! And she relies on other artists apperance within this CD to help boost her sales.  Please.  A true artists would not need to rely on other artists to provoke sales.  I recommend &quot;Stripped&quot; by Christina Aguilera, at least there you see real raw talent as well as maturity.  For Britney, expect more lip synching performances and stay away fom this cd.  My friend has wasted money on buying me this CD, but oh well, I'll gain some dollars through selling it off EBAY.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I really thought there wasn't any way Josh could top his first CD. You know how you really look forward to something and then when it gets here, you end up disappointed. NOT THIS TIME!!! Every song is wonderful,but esp &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; and the 3rd track with Josh Bell on the violin. If you liked the first one, you'll love this one.
B0000TB05A|5.0|The band was simply in the groove during this show, nothing like the stiff performance in Boston. There is a reason the fans lobbied to get this released, It rocks!! Simple as that. Bono hasnt sounded better in years and there is real emotion in his vocals.
B00004TS0E|1.0|For every movie remake that improves on, or at least stands apart from, its original (1986's The Fly and 1999's The Thomas Crown Affair leap to mind), there are a dozen remakes like this one that serve only to remind everyone how superior the original is. Even presenting the remake in color seems like a mistake--George Seaton's 1947 original, with its black-and-white, almost documentary-like presentation, gives a realistic foundation to its fantasy concept. The 1994 remake, on the other hand, is suffused with a burnished glow that gives the film the look of a Hallmark card, with about as much depth. And don't look to the new script for help. As re-imagined by writer/producer John Hughes, the update's only new wrinkles are an &quot;evil&quot; toy-store chain to rival the &quot;good&quot; one, protracted courtroom sequences, and a finale that has neither the visual nor logical wit of the mail-delivery denouement of the original. Only the remake's strong cast makes it even remotely watchable. Richard Attenborough is a fine Kris Kringle, Elizabeth Perkins shines as a single mom, and little Mara Wilson is very appealing in the role originally played by Natalie Wood. It's also fun to see veteran heavies James Remar and J.T. Walsh take their villainy down a few notches. The only real disappointment is Dylan McDermott, who can't match the original's John Payne for rakish charm. On the whole, the only real significance of this film--except to make the original seem all the better--is to help chart the decline of John Hughes' once-promising career. Hughes raised the bar on teen comedy (Sixteen Candles,The Breakfast Club) and directed one brilliant &quot;grown-up&quot; film (1987's Planes, Trains and Automobiles) before giving up to oversee the recycling of other material, including his own, into enterprises whose ambitions never seemed to rise above &quot;make lots of money.&quot; (Subsequent Hughes remakes include Flubber and 101 Dalmatians, and more Home Alone sequels thanFederal law should allow.) In the end, the 1994 Miracle on 34th street is serviceable background fodder while you wrap presents or trim the tree, but if you want a movie to WATCH, get the original.
0064407667|5.0|This book is the wonderful beginning to a fabulous series of books. everyone should read it. that's all i have to say.
0790729628|5.0|This visually stunning sci-fi cult classic is one of my all time favorite films. I too agree with a previous reviewer who said the original theatrical release was better, even if it had the monotonous dead panned sounding narrative by Harrison Ford. That narrative is what really gave this futuristic cop film its retro-noirish feel (Humphrey Bogart style). As for the &quot;happy&quot; or &quot;uplifiting&quot; ending, who said that it really is a happy ending; remember the narrative closing lines that Deckard gives about not knowing how long the replicant Rachel has to live? Also, you now have an ending with a cop on the run with a runaway replicant. So, the bleak question is how long do they both have before someone or something catches up to them?... Seeing the director's cut where the elevator doors in the end just close to the credits rolling to me implied an easy way out for the director or film editor to get out of completing the story or film somehow. While artistically it was a nice segueing blackout fade for the credits to roll it did nothing to improve or add to the film. When I saw the unicorn dream sequence it felt very out of place. Albeit the reason we now know that Scott added it was to give the sense that Deckard too was a replicant. However, whose to say that the unicorn in his head was not a thought or memory that he too knew replicants had as part of their memory implants ? Maybe he was just remembering or dreaming about what he also knew could be in a replicant's mind. After all, he knew about the spider memory he tells Rachel about and Rachel completes the memory in the dialogue. <br />The point is is that Blade Runner, whether Director's Cut version or original theatrical version is better than the other one thing remains; Blade Runner was and is the pinnacle of using small scale models when computer graphics had not been the norm yet. Music by Vangelis is also another powerful artisitic catalyst that makes Blade Runner that much more captivating and timeless !
B0000DJZA5|5.0|John Lennon liked the way Phil Spector produced &quot;Let It Be&quot;<br />Paul McCartney never did. The new &quot;Naked&quot; is Paul's vision.<br />&quot;Let It Be&quot; was a last ditch effort attempted by McCartney to re-energize the soon to be falling apart Beatles. The Idea was to record a back to basics rock n roll album stripped of studio wizardry. It failed to do so. Spector was handed the tapes by Lennon after Glyn Johns failed to produce &quot;The Get Back Sessions to The Beatles liking. Lennon was quoted as saying &quot;Phil was givin a pile of Sh*t to work with and did an excellent job.&quot; Missing on &quot;Naked&quot; Are the lush Spectorized Wall Of Sound strings and choirs on &quot;Let It Be&quot;, The Long And Winding Road&quot;, &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; and &quot;Across The Universe&quot; What we now have are phenominally re-mixed and incredibly punchy sounding bunch of songs sans the Spectorized lushness. Ringo's drums have never sounded this great on a Beatles recording.<br />The acoustic guitar on I, Me, Mine is brought forward in the mix and sounds as if your sitting in the room next to George.<br />Missing from this version are the famous Lennon wackyness between songs such as &quot;I Hope We Pass The Audition&quot; and &quot;Hark The Angels&quot; Also missing are the songs &quot;Maggie May&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; On the plus side, added for the first time is &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; This is an exciting and not to be missed addition the the otherwise perfect and saintly Beatles Catalog.<br />Also included on a second disc is &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; Which include studio discussions and rehersal outtakes. Interesting tidbits include an early version of Lennon's &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; and Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;
B0000026CN|5.0|Admittedly there are at least three tracks on Blues For Salvador that have a really outdated 80's pop rock commercial feel for the time. But the rest of the set is purely heaven sent and timeless !<BR>There is an experimental quality with Blues For Salvador that was not really felt or expressed with Santana's other pop sounding projects or efforts from the 80's. At times there is a slight underlying new age or ambient feel to some of the instrumentals such as Mingus. The Latin, rock, jazz fusion sound is still there and umistakeably Santana's trademark sound.<BR>Like I said, forget about the few pop-like tracks, while a bit catchy (I'm Gone, 'Trane, Deeper Big Deeper) and concentrate on the majority of excellent material that is here !<br />I was going to give this recording only 4 stars but because Bella is one of the most beautiful instrumentals Santana has ever written I have to bump it to 5...
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I love this album, I listen to it continuously in the car and have not tired of it yet.  Initially, the only song I enjoyed was Fallen but the others have slowly grown on me and I now love them all except the last track.  This is definitely worth buying.  It is my favorite of hers so far.
0156027321|5.0|What an outstanding read! It is necessary to read more than once - first literally and then symbolically. The more you read it the more you will see in it.  The story is smooth and funny, serious and appalling. The writing is a pleasure to read. If you want more out of your books than fluff, this is the book for you. It should be used in classrooms - a great teaching tool for student writers.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|What to make of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier? Of all the Star Trek feature films, the fifth entry in the series is considered by most fans to be the weakest and least satisfying.  Even though it was produced by Harve Bennett, who had saved the franchise with Star Trek II, its plot -- a renegade Vulcan hijacks the starship Enterprise and takes it to the center of the galaxy on a quest to find God -- is rather pretentious and its director, William Shatner, learned that success at directing episodes of &quot;T.J. Hooker&quot; did not ensure success in the making of a multi-million dollar film.<br />Star Trek V is set a short time after The Voyage Home.  It is the 23rd Century, and although Capt. James T. Kirk (Shatner) and his loyal crew have been assigned to the new Enterprise-A, their new starship turned out to be a lemon.  Nothing seems to be working properly, so while chief engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan) and the rest of the crew make critical repairs to the starship's systems, Kirk, Spock (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. &quot;Bones&quot; McCoy (DeForest Kelley) go down to Yosemite National Park for some R &amp; R. The ever-restless (and somewhat reckless) Kirk tries to free climb El Capitan, but has to be saved by his half-human, half-Vulcan first officer when he loses his grip and nearly falls to his death.  Later, Kirk says to his friends that he was not afraid as he fell because he knew they were there.  &quot;I've always known I'll die alone,&quot; he reveals in one of the movie's rare poignant moments.<br />But the idyllic campout is cut short when a shuttlecraft piloted by Cmdr. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) lands nearby with bad news. Shore leave has been canceled and all officers are to report back to the Enterprise.  Sure enough, no sooner does Kirk step inside the bridge than Admiral Bob Bennett (Harve Bennett in a cameo) informs the captain that a group of terrorists has taken over the planet Nimbus III, the &quot;Planet of Galactic Peace.&quot;  Ostensibly a first attempt at peaceful collaboration between the Federation, the Klingons and the Romulan Empire, Nimbus III has become a desolate dumping ground for the undesirables and unlucky of the three major powers. Kirk's mission is to take the Enterprise to Nimbus III and mount a rescue mission as quickly as possible.<br />The terrorists, led by Sybok, a Vulcan renegade (Laurence Luckinbill), are holding three delegates from the three &quot;owners&quot; of Nimbus III hostage.  Their goal: to lure a starship so that Sybok and his followers can go to the center of the galaxy in search of the mythical planet Sha-Ka-Ree, the planet from which all Creation emerged.<br />Kirk is shocked when he learns that Sybok is not only a Vulcan who rejects the suppression of all emotions and believes that God lives on Sha-Ka-Ree; he's also Spock's half-brother from his father Sarek's first marriage to a Vulcan princess.  Now Sybok has re-entered Spock's life and hopes to enlist him into his cause...creating conflict within Spock's heart, and causing tension between first officer and captain.<br />Not only does Kirk have to deal with a renegade Vulcan and the possible defection of a loyal friend, but a Klingon Bird of Prey -- assigned to rescue the Klingon member of Nimbus III's troika -- is on the prowl.  Commanded by a young and aggressive Klingon captain, the Bird-of-Prey chases the Enterprise into the radiation-rich center of the galaxy....<br />To give Shatner credit, there were many reasons for Star Trek V's less-than-stellar performance at the box office.  In the wake of Star Trek IV's huge crossover success, producer Bennett had hoped that writer Nicholas Meyer would be available to write the screenplay for the fifth Trek film.  Unfortunately, Meyer wasn't on hand at the time, so David Loughery was hired to pen the script based on a story by Bennett and Shatner.  The hope was, as Walter Koenig (Cmdr. Pavel Chekov) told an audience at a Star Trek convention in 1989 (before thefilm was released) to recreate The Voyage Home's mix of humor and adventure, with a meaningful message tacked on as well.<br />Making matters worse, the special effects by Brian Ferren and Associates are pretty cheap looking, and budgetary pressures watered down many of Shatner's original concepts (including an opening scene that was the reverse of what would be Star Trek: First Contact's opening shot).<br />As a result, fans largely denounced the over ambitious story and its low rent production values, Star Trek V. Even Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry gave it a seal of disapproval, saying that some of its storyline (the Sybok character, one supposes) was apocryphal.<br />Paramount has given this runt of the litter the Collector's Edition treatment, bundling the film on one disc (with director Shatner providing commentary) with a second disc featuring  behind-the-scenes features. If you're a must-have-the-whole-set type of DVD collector, buy this one for the sake of completeness.  Otherwise, skip it and wait for the Collector's Edition of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country.he film was released) to recreate The Voyage Home's mix of humor and adventure, with a meaningful message tacked on as well.<br />Making matters worse, the special effects by Brian Ferren and Associates are pretty cheap looking, and budgetary pressures watered down many of Shatner's original concepts (including an opening scene that was the reverse of what would be Star Trek: First Contact's opening shot).  <br />As a result, fans largely denounced the over ambitious story and its low rent production values, Star Trek V.

B00009TB5G|4.0|The extended scenes are useful in terms of the story, but most of the new scenes are choppy and sometimes whimsical.  The worst was a brief scene where Gandalf tells Aragorn the current state of Middle Earth.  It breaks the first rule of a good narrative: &quot;show me don't tell me.&quot;  One interesting scene involves Denethor with Faramir and Boromir together.  It is a creative way to build the characters, drawing attention to their uneasy family relationship and the plight of Gondor;  interesting, but wisely cut from the theatrical release.<br />Strangely enough, the first part of the Two Towers story was moved to the end of the first film, while the ending has been pushed out into the the Return of the King.  Unfortunately the death of Boromir and Frodo's confrontation with Shelob and his subsequent capture are two strengths of the book and their absence weakens this second adaptation.<br />Tolkien divides the book between the ring-bearer quest and the other story threads.  This makes the book somewhat tedious and it is more difficult to follow which events occur simultaneously.  Jackson deftly weaves among all of the plots more evenly which pulls the story together very well.
0064400557|4.0|This is one of the truly classic children's fantasy books.  Every child growing up should be allowed to experience this book.  A book that any reader can relate to, this book definitely deserves medals it did not win.<BR>Charlotte's Web is a simple story about survival and love.  Wilbur has struggled to survive from day one.  He was born a runt, but grows big and strong due to the love of a girl.  I think runts everywhere appreciate this book becuase they can relate to being small.  Then there is the theme of love, no one can live a complete life unless they have loved.  Wilbur finds love first in Fern and then in Charlotte.<BR>Even though this book was written almost fiftly years ago, readers still enjoy the story today.  Good fantasies never age and this is a perfect example of one.  The fantasy parts of the book are the fact that animals talk but the setting is so realistic that it makes you wonder what animals really are saying.
0307120007|5.0|This is a delightful story about two children, Paul and Judy.  This story tells of the many things that children can do.  It allows children to experience all their senses.  This is definitely a good book for early childhood.<BR>This book tells what Paul and Judy can do and then invites the children to try it as well.  It involves most of their senses from smelling flowers to putting their finger through mother's ring.  Children love this book because it allows them to be active participants instead of passive listeners.<BR>The clear, uncluttered background makes it easy for children to understand the main action going on in the page.  There are different textures used from a soft bunny to daddy's scratchy beard.  The softer pastel colors really let the activities shine.<BR>The book is one of my favorites.  I even went and bought one of my own and a video that goes along with it.  I read it to all my family and friends all the time.<BR>This book is meant for early childhood, but I think it could be very helpful in teaching young special education students as well.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I loved Shania Twain's Up! Live in Chicago because of her 9 member Fabulous Falls Rock Band which adds a lot of zest and rock to Shania Twains music! I particularly liked the way Shania Twain is able to multitask by singing, shaking hands, giving high fives pointing at various signs indicating her favorites all at the same time without skipping a note! I have noticed that everyone in the audience is having a good time and is participating with Shania Twain by singing with her! Seems that most seem to know her music and are having real fun with it! There were parts that were left out but hey the DVD overall was way cool!<br />Benjamin Rhoads

B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is the best and my favourite Slipknot cd. I liked almost every song on the cd, some examples (sic), Diluted, wait And Bleed, Surfacing, and Spit It Out. For any metal fans, Slipknots the $h!t. Highly, highly, highly recommend this one. You wont be disappointed.
B00005JMF6|5.0|You know-this is all of my 2 cents-because for most of the movie I was cowering in my seat and covering my eyes. I am very prone to nightmares-so if you're like me-watch this movie with someone. <BR>Halle Berry plays Dr. Miranda Grey a psychologist (psychiatrist?) for a women's mental institution in Connecticut. She begins the movie counselling a patient named Chloe- (Penelope Cruz)-who has been suffering from rape trauma. You are drawn in and introduced to her cushy, perfect life as a doctor who objectively treats her patients, and has a certain aloof detachment from them. The visuals exhibit this with the change of scenery from the dungeon-like ward where the women are kept, and Dr. Grey's upstairs academic office. You find out she has everything she would want, respect and admiration from her fellow doctors, and a successful loving husband who is also a fellow doctor. She is motivated, driven and completely stolid and objective to her surroundings. The movie changes when she awakens after trying to treat a beaten girl whom she nearly ran over on the side of the road. The next thing is-she is in the actual ward where she is a patient who has been in a catatonic state for 3 days after she allegedly murdered her husband. The rest of the movie is basically about answering the one question-why??? Like I said-this movie is scary as hell-and has a lot of jumpy thrills and pop-outs, so if you're like me-make sure you have someone there with you and the lights on!!!! Other than that-it was awesome! Enjoy!

0156029065|4.0|Loved &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; and expected another adventure with  &quot;Baudolino&quot;, but like many of the other reviewers here I agree that this one goes nowhere.  The book starts with our hero Baudolino in Constantinople while it is being invaded and burnt, he has rescued Niketas, court historian and very rich man, and proceeds to relate his own amazing life story to Niketas.  Born a peasant in Italy, Baudolino was adopted by Emperor Frederick for saving his life, later a student in Paris, then in pursuit of the Holy Grail into the kingdom of Prester John.  Or is it all a lie?<br />Too many medieval events and characters all crammed into one book, and Baudolino was just not a likable enough guy  to make me care what happened to him, Niketas was more interesting to me with his wise intellect and sensual delight in eating.
B00005JM02|2.0|With all the hype surrounding this film, I expected it to at least be entertaining.  While my family loved Toy Story and a Bug's Life, we were unanimous in giving this film a &quot;blah&quot;.  The animation is very well done, but the characters are uninteresting, there is no chemistry be tween them and the plot is one long wandering effort, ultimately unsuccessful, to bring in other minor characters in an attempt to bring some interest to the film.<br />Dory's memory problem is annoying and brings nothing to the story.  The best part of the film are the characters in the aquarium, but that is damning with faint praise.<br />If you are older than 8, find a better way to waste a couple hours of your life.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam could have sold out and ..... themselves like every other band out there, but they didn't, and they may have suffered for it in record sales, but they are still the best rock band around.  I bought this album a year ago and I'm still listening to it.  These guys should get a medal for speaking out against government corruption and greed in these brainwashed times.  They put their butts on the line and I love 'em for it.  The songs are great, and so's the message.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Between the classic Armitage backdrops and the beautiful animation (it's hard to explain to kids today that Maleficent was drawn BY HAND, not in a computer, a'la Pixar) this ranks among the most intricate animated films ever made.<br />This film is from an era when feats of animation were displayed without apology- the flames licking the vine that envelopes Sleeping Beauty's castle, for example(and really, the vine itself) are testament to a bygone time when stunning visual effects were all the more stunning for having come from a real hand, a real paintbrush, liquid ink.<br />The story itself is a departure, in classic Disney style, from the original Sleeping Beauty stories from cross-cultural folklore.  Disney implements such characters as the fairies, the bumbling King Hubert, anthropomorphic animals (always) and the greatest villian of all time- Maleficent.  These characters mesh with the sheer animation artistry to raise this bedtime story from the context of simple narrative to the epic romantic accomplishment of the type Disney is known for.<br />While we all, of course, anticipate the happy ending, the wedding, the classic Disney optimism, this one is worth looking at not only as an archetypical fairy tale, but also as an exemplar of mid-century animated art.
B0000E1WNV|2.0|I have to agree with the reviewer who raised issues about the audio, I've been listening to the 5.1 track and it definitely seems to fluctuate badly, which is very disconcerting and completely spoils the enjoyment of the DVD, the stereo soundtrack seems fine which is really not good enough. It will be interesting to see if other people also feel that there is a problem with this, again it shouldn't be the Home Theatre system which is high end.<BR>As for the other aspects of the DVD it acts well as a companion piece to the &quot;Live In New York City&quot; one offering the rising songs, although the omission of &quot;Further on up the road&quot; is a big disapointment for me. Also although the picture quality is extremely good the rapid editing is annoying ( a fate also suffered by Pink Floyd - Delicate Sound of Thunder), maybe the lesson is that you should never give a director too many it's  not even a patch on the far superior Live In New York City DVD.<BR>3 Stars as it's Bruce but an extremely poorly executed DVD, for such a major artist, in fact 2 stars as I'm listening to it now and I can't bear the 5.1 soundtrack.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney is evolving into another level of pop success...this cd is by far her best produced cd and best sounding. definetely worth the buy
B00008J4P5|5.0|The White Stripes....are they husband and wife? Sister and brother? Who cares...the CD stays in my rotation and this is one CD that can be played from the first song, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, to the last without having to press the fast forward button.  If you enjoy mellow rock, strange lyrics,(seriously, squirrels), and lots of bass guitar, then I'd recommend this CD.
630027120X|4.0|En la pelcula The Mission, dirigido por Roland Joff, un cura que se llama Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) vine a un pueblo indigena en las montaas para que los convirtiera en cristianos y ensearlos la manera en vivir una vida civil (como los europeos).  Al hacerlo, haba mucho conflicto entre los indigenas y los de Espaa y Portugal.  Como siempre muestran los pelculas y mucho de la literatura, las Coronas de Espaa y Portugal maltrataron los indigenas para mostrar el poder y ganar la tierra.  En el proceso, los indigenas tena que sufrir mucho por causea de la injustica de Europa.  Tenan que cambiar o abandonar muchos (si no todos) de los costumbres y tradiciones que practicaban antes.  Tena que luchar para la dignidad del pueblo.  <BR>Esta pelcula demuestra claramente la tema de injustica entre los indigenas (Guarani) y los europeos.  Los europeos vinieron a cambiar el mundo salvaje y ni dieron cuento que la vida que vivieron los indigenas era completamente suficiente para ellos.  Durante toda esta pelcula la ignorancia y brutalidad de los europeos (smbolos de la oscuridad y la maldad de la humanidad) puso un mala reputacin en el nombre de humano blanco. En realidad, uno puede decir que las cosas no han cambiado mucho.  Ahora como antes, los indigenas tienen el derecho y una razon racionable a rebelar contra la sociedad civil.<BR>Casi todas las pelculas que viene de Hollywood terminan la pelcula con algo maravilloso...los buenos ganan y los malos se mueren o se castiguen.  Esta pelcula, no termina as.  Termina con la verdad, la verdad que todava sique la lucha de los indigenas.  S, termina con la esperanza de que quizas los nios indigenas tendrn la oportunidad a vivir la vida en paz y continuarn con los tradicciones y culturas indigenas, pero la dejamos pensar.  La dejamos pensar en que ahora sabemos que pas, Cmo vamos a cambiar nuestra mente despus de saber que pas?  <BR>Algo que me molesta muchisimo es como producieron la pelcula en la mentalidad de los Europeos.  Los indigenas eran el sujeto de la pelcula, pero ni uno de ellos tenan un parte sigificante en la pelcula entera.  Cuando hablaron ellos, no traducieron niguna palabra.  Eso solamente amplifa el pensamiento del hombre europeo (blanco) que la idioma y cultura de los indigenas no tiene valor para gastar el dinero a traducir lo que dijeron.  Si en realidad queran mostrar que los indigenas tienen un identidad y voz importante, traducieran la idioma indigena.
B0000584V3|5.0|I am a big music fan and i listen many kind of styles of music. I owned thousands records, so i suppose i know my own taste.<br />I dont tell nothing about this record cause others have do it. SIMPLY, i said: &quot;THIS IS BEST RECORD EVER MADE!&quot;<br />Every time i listen this record, tears are falling to my face and i am in nirvana. Everything is here: ideas, melodic, progressive, rawness, brutaliness...i am wordless...
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is upbeat and enthusiastic right from start to finish. Her interaction with the crowd is effective. Many times you see the crowd sing along. The band's joy and love of what their doing and the music their playing is energizing. If you weren't a fan before this DVD will make you one! Shania's energy never fails. You will never sit down watching this one!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After waiting two years since her last album \\"Britney\\", Jive presents us with Britney Spears- \\"In The Zone\\". Twelve new tracks of what I call, short of being a masterpiece or the perfect album! This album is destined to be Britney's fourth consecutive album to go straight to number one. <br />This album definately has something for everyone's tastes. She has her usual pop sound, some rap, reggae, dance and even a little rockish at times with a dash of a few ballads towards the end. Let's break it down:<br />1. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC: The first single, great choice for first single. It features MADONNA. The video is great, dancing is incredible. This song is very catchy, but still does not quite capture the magic of the full album. Check out the maxi-single with all the remixes coming in December 2003! 10/10<br />2. I GOT THAT (BOOM BOOM): From what I am hearing, this will possibly be the second single. It features the YING YANG TWINS. I personally do not like the rappers in this song. I think it ruins the song, but for r and b and rap lovers, you will very much enjoy this song. If released, it will blow up on the airwaves. 7/10 (Higher if Ying Yang Twins were not w/Britney)<br />3. SHOWDOWN: One of my favorites on the album. It is pure pop/dance with a splash of reggae. Funky beats that change throughout the song. You'll want to blast this in you car. 10/10<br />4. BREATHE ON ME: Another one of my favorites. Sounds like a Kylie Minogue song meets early Madonna Erotica. A total club song in its original album form! Just wait for the remixes. This will definately be a single. Pulsating beats, [greate] vocals. 10/10<br />5. EARLY MORNIN': Moby produced track. Very Asian, Indian influenced. Its an average track. My least favorite. 7/10<br />6. TOXIC: I have to agree with most everyone else here. What a song! I would say its my favorite! This song is not like any song you have heard before. Very dance-oriented, cool electronic beats mixed w/awesome Britney vocals makes this a dance fiesta! I hope this becomes a single with remixes! 10/10<br />7. OUTRAGEOUS: Yes, its repetitive, but its so funky and cool. It is definately for rap and r and b lovers! Its got bangin' beats and it's like something she has never done before! 10/10<br />8. TOUCH OF MY HAND: A song about what almost everyone does when they are alone and in need should we say. Very sensual ...song w/cool vocals and an eerie bassline. Great track! 9/10<br />9. THE HOOK UP: Very reggae!! Think SEAN PAUL! Brings back the Middle Eastern beats, definately a dance track that will bring anyone to their feet! I love it! 10/10<br />10. SHADOW: First ballad on this cd. World famous Britney ballad. Excellent lyrics and vocals on this one! 9/10<br />11. BRAVE NEW GIRL: Its the one song on this cd that seems like it does not fit with the others. However, its still very unique, there are dance elements with this song that I just cannot explain! It would be perfect for a LEGALLY BLONDE soundtrack.<BR>There is rap in it, dance, and of course POP! 10/10<br />12. EVERYTIME: If you like ballads, if you like Britney, if you like Britney ballads- be prepared to experience the most beautiful song you have heard in a long time. Might even make you shed a tear, pure magic and mystery! EXCELLENT! 10/10<br />13. ME AGAINST THE MUSIC (RISHI RICH'S DESI KULCHA REMIX): Such a waste to put this on here. Would rather have had another new Britney song, like the three songs that did not make it to the American IN THE ZONE album: THE ANSWER, DON'T HANG UP and I JUST BEGUN (HAVING MY FUN). Find them to still stay IN THE ZONE! 7/10<br />How can one say these days that they love an ENTIRE album? How can one say that every song on an album could be a SINGLE promoted with music videos and remixes? How? I'll tell you how. It's \\"IN THE ZONE\\"! Once your \\"IN THE ZONE\\" w/Britney Spears, you will never want to get out!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|The best thing about watching this disc is being at the concert without having to stand for 16 hours<BR>Throughout the concert, it is evident that Shania enjoys not only singing live but also the camaraderie of her band as well as feeding off of the energy from her fans. There are 22 songs including &quot;You're Still The One,&quot; &quot;Nah&quot; and the concert favorite, &quot;Rock This Country!&quot; When the DVD is over, anyone who may have thought of Shania as a studio creation most surely will understand that this Canadian woman is not only a good singer but an even better entertainer. She knows what her fans want and she delivers it to them.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let's get this straight, This is the album as it should have been. There has been a lot of talk about how this is Paul's project alone. This is simply not the case. Before his death, George Harrison commented that the tracks on \\"Let It Be\\" would have been improved by eliminating the overdubs that Phil Spector put on them. Ringo also has approved of this project. Several people have stated that Lennon would not have approved of this project based on his remarks during the recording of the \\"Let It Be\\" tracks. It must be noted that John was already in the initial process of leaving the Beatles and that he would have said almost anything in order to distance himself from this or any other future Beatles project. It must also be said that John at this time was using heroin which never seems to be brought up. It is to his credit that he was able to finish the project at all, let alone contribute a few songs... Lennon should be considered a work horse considering the drug that he was consuming. Now let's get to the tracks. My initial impression is that the songs have benefited greatly from being remixed. What you get is a crystal clear remix, gone is the wall of sound layering that weighed down many of the songs on the original release. I was particularly struck by George's songs which I feel have gained the most from the remix. \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is a totally new track and my feeling is that it is far better and more playful than the original. Billy Preston finally gets his due as the keyboardist and now you can hear why the Beatles chose him to due this project. There were some minor things that bugged me at first but with repeated listening, I got used to them. One is the short pause between \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Dig A Pony\\". The other is that I preferred the overdubbed Harrison lead on \\"Let It Be\\" to the original which is included here. Overall, a much better product than the original and a much better mix. If you want to hear the Beatles and not Phil Spector then this is the ticket.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The sound and the look of the video are fabulous. Shania looks so incrediblly energized by the crowd. If you saw the tv special you'll find  6 extra songs on the dvd. No way will any fan be disappointed by adding this to your collection. If you went to the chicago concert you just might see yourself as there are plenty of fans shots. This dvd will instantly become your favorite!
B0000E1WNV|5.0|I don't know why so many comment on the audio quality - on only a reasonably decent audio system, this sounds clear with no distortion.  I also have problems with the second disc, but can play it on many players with taking a few extra steps to directly choose the chapter.  <br />No matter, the PLUSES (Incident, She's The One, Promised Land,,,) make this a MUST HAVE!
B0000TB03W|5.0|The sound and the look of the video are fabulous. Shania looks so incrediblely happy as does the audience who sing along to every tune.

B0000DJZAH|5.0|Tommy is not my favorite Who album (that title is reserved for Quadrophenia) but it is certainly up there in my favorite album lists.  When I saw that it was out on SACD, I had to get it and I was not disappointed.  It definately sounds alot better than the CD version, especially with all the instruments coming out at all angles.  Pinball Wizard really impressed me though.  You could really hear Townsend on that one and I could imagine him in my living room windmilling.  The 5.1 mix is definately worth the price of this CD.  I don't have a review of the other tracks, because I'm listening to them right now, but they aren't bad.<br />Anyways, with releases like this, I am hoping this means that SACD will beat out DVD Audio.  I am also hoping that Quadrophenia will get the same treatment.
B0000TB03W|5.0|As always, she is full of energy, enthusiasm, and grace. Her catalog of songs is just the right mix  from her hit new album &quot;UP!&quot; and those classics we all love like &quot;From This Moment On and You're Still The One.! Shania is the quintessential performer. If you're a Shania fan, you definitely want to get your hands on a copy of this DVD ASAP! This DVD performance shows Shania Twain at her best!
B0000A98ZP|1.0|This is without a doubt one of the dumbest and worst films ever made.  I came of age during the 80s and even I can't sit through it.  Terrible performances, breathtakingly silly dialogue, and gawdawful music.  Is to film what Wang Chung was to music.  A real super-duper-pooper.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Overall, I really enjoyed the DVD. Shania sounded great and was very entertaining.. Thank goodness for Shania and the band's excellent performance. The audience was a pleasure. The music is a mixed collection of old favorites with new soon to be favorites. A sheer joy to watch!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Best band I've heard in years. The Beatles collide with AC/DC with a side order of punk.
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the moment the dvd starts you will be in heaven. Shania is definitely the most amazing performer today. There are 22 mesmerizing songs in all. With fantastic upclose footage of Shania and the wonderful Fabulous Falls band that backs her up. Lots of shots of the audience who are obviously loving every single second will leave you wishing you could have been there. I didn't have the pleasure of attending the Chicago concert but I got to see it on TV and now am a proud owner of the dvd!
B0000TB03W|4.0|Thats right..get UP and get it..this is one of the best DVD concert footage/songs and all around fun !!!!I am so glad I went out yesterday and got it !!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|For over 105 minutes Shania is non-stop energy and her band keeps up. The audience just beams with love of the music as well as the entertainer. From start to finish you'll be dancing in your home.Shania delivers moves that puts other artist to shame. Definitely add this to your collection.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shanias Up! Live In Chicago can only be described as, Amaz-ing! Shania truely shows how much she really cares for her fans with this free concert in the park. if you were unlucky as i was in being able to attend, this dvd is the next best thing. it has everything in it. including more footage than the nbc special airing! get it have it share it!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Top to bottom, this album contains every element of greatness that Iron Maiden have ever been known for.  There is not any one song or moment on the record that make it stand out, it is just solid from start to finish.  More creative, more progressive, more inventive, but above all else, more Maiden!
B0000TB03W|5.0|WOW! What is there else to say! Get the dvd and see what im raving about! The DVD is GREAT!!! The Concert in the Park has to be the top free concert of the year! Shania really shows her true self in this concert. she has got it all, style, looks, the voice, the list goes on for miles! If you only buy one dvd this year make sure its this one! and if its not, return the other one for this one!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is an awsome game. It sucks.Do not barrow it. Leave more for me.<br />Love,<BR>the guy sitting behind you
B0000TB03W|5.0|SHANIA HAS OUTDONE HERSELF AGAIN!!! this is the must own live concert dvd of the year! if u missed the nbc special are u in for a treat!

B00008IAMD|5.0|I'm neither a country music fan nor a Johnny Cash fan (I found \\"The Essential Johnny Cash\\" to be mostly boring), but I think this is one of the finest albums of any type that I've ever heard. Pain and death just don't get any better than this. <br />The depth and power of Cash's rendition of \\"Hurt\\" is incredible. Simon & Garfunkel's version of \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" seems pale and limp in comparison to Cash's. Cash's rendition of Tex Ritter's \\"Sam Hall\\" earns two hoots and a hollar at least. And Cash's own compositions are among the best he'd ever done (or at least as good as or better than the best tracks on \\"The Essential Johnny Cash\\"). I find myself repeating \\"The Man Comes Around\\" more often than not.  There's not a bad track on the album. He even manages to make \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" tolerable. And that's no mean feat.<br />One final note: I'd definitely recommend spending the extra three bucks to get the version with the bonus DVD of \\"Hurt.\\" Amazingly powerful stuff.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I watched this film the first time because of it's Academy Award.  I bought a copy because this is by far the best portrayal of schizophrenia I have ever encountered.  It has become a frame of reference, a tool for communicating with family and friends; they have a means of understanding what I could never explain.
B000065V41|4.0|Behold, the \\"Muppet\\" version of the classic Dickens' holiday horror story. The macabre premise of ghosts and things that go *bump* in the night is softened by the whimsical critters made popular by Jim Henson, bless his heart.<br />It's no small wonder that Scrooge (played by Kermit) begins to experience nightmares, after a long bout with severe social anxiety and antisocial personality disorder. I imagine anyone would have such psychological problems if they were being stalked by a large singing pig wearing a blond wig. I know I would. Why, I'd be afraid to open up to anyone, too!<br />The situation is made worse by the hallucinations Kermit starts having at night. He seems much more at ease with the spectres that haunt his dreams than he does with other talking frogs, however- a curiousity that is never quite explained in this film.<br />Scrooge/Kermit takes us on a journey into his own psyche, where his fears take form and he sees his life as it is, and will be if he doesn't do something about his stalker.<br />Rather than call the police about her and get an order of protection or telling his frog family to bugger off, he enters a state of denial, fantisizing that everything will be good in his life if he just gives in to the demands of others.<br />Gleefully, the other characters commence spending his fortune on themselves. One can only imagine that they are too selfish and impatient to wait for their inheritance, and we hope that Kermit/Scrooge does not truly die alone, as his nightmarish premonition suggested.
B000001E18|5.0|\\"Achtung Baby\\" could very well be their best album in just about every way. It is the most innovative, brilliant, and deepest album of their career and it is along with \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" my favorite album from U2. The band really pushed boundaries with that album. 1993's \\"Zooropa\\" dives even further into the electronica field yet still maintains the spirit of their original trademark sound but trades most of the atmospherics of their previous albums and exchanges them for more techno dance styles. It may not have turned out to match the power of the previous album but this is a great and excellent follow-up to that life-altering masterpiece and one of their most creative albums they have ever made to date. For a surprising note, this was originally planned on being just and EP instead of a full-length album! Surprisingly enough considering the crazy yet creative album cover art, \\"Zooropa\\" overall is a relatively mellow album but the first three songs are very odd yet enticing. \\"Zooropa\\" This album while it was number for a short period of time, yielded only one minor hit and that was \\"Stay Far Away So Close\\". This is one of my earliest memories of hearing U2's music during the tail end of the grunge era. Those who are expecting very crazy and explosive electronic mayhem based on the chaotic album cover may find themselves a bit disappointed as this is one of U2's mellowest albums but there are songs that do portray the craziness of the cover art.<br />The really eccentric songs are the opening title track, \\"Numb\\" and \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\".  \\"Lemon\\" is my favorite of these tracks. It's a very bizarre yet highly addictive song with a mix of techno-electronic sounds combined with live rock sounds. \\"Numb\\" is a very addictive song with pulsating beat, highly piercing electric guitars and oddly amplified vocal effects that result in a very appealing song. I've noticed no difference between this and the version on the \\"Best of 1990-2000\\" album. The second half of the album is relatively mellow compared the first half. \\"The First Time\\" is definite resting time music which harkens back to some of the atmospherics of their previous albums and deceives the listener with the mellowness considering that the album cover would say otherwise. While this song is very good, I have no idea why it found its way on the best of 1990-2000 collection because it's definitely not among their best songs during this era. The original version of \\"Lemon\\" should've been put on there. The last song on here with the late country legend Johnny Cash \\"The Wanderer\\" is a fantastic closer with a slight country-oriented twist.<br />While this album did debut at number one, the only significant hit this album yielded was \\"Stay Faraway So Close\\" which is my favorite song on this entire album. This is a very passionate and edgy love song that in some ways veers in a different direction from the rest of this album, being a very rock-oriented song with far less techno electronic sound and a more straight-out rock sound. This is a well-deserved hit and is the best song on this underrated album. I really like the lyrics too as they perfectly fit the mood of the song. Nice job U2! That song is then followed by the most bizarre and most experimental track that U2 has ever written \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\\", another favorite song of mine. It begins with static radio sounds followed by gritty sounding parade-like trumpets then the real song begins with highly robotic industrial siren like sound effects for a melody and buzzy electronic rhythm which to a degree remind me of what Front 242 or Nitzer Ebb would do. The song then becomes a groovy and very odd track with awesome bobbing guitars and fast-paced rhythm and a slightly apocalyptic feel to it. I have no idea what the song is about but based on listening to it, U2 sure know how to have fun. I really love this song. DCPFYCC is one of the highlights on this album. The rest of the songs I haven't mentioned are very good as well but the ones I mentioned deserved the most attention. Occasionally this CD may drift occasionally but overall &quot;Zooropa&quot; is excellent. If there are any flaws on here, it's when the techno electronica sometimes goes over-the-top especially towards the ending of the title track but that's nothing worth complaining about.<br /> Upon reading reviews right and left, I assume that a good number of fans felt that U2 jumped the shark when they released this album and did so again with the following album &quot;Pop&quot;. I completely disagree with all of these statements to a high degree. I think that it was a smart and creative move by U2 to try out new styles yet retain the spirit of their trademark sound. It's just sad that many weren't willing to dive into this excellent era in their career. I definitely prefer the crunching sonics of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; and the moody atmospherics that defined &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; over &quot;Zooropa&quot; but there's no denying that this is a very good album anyhow. Those who like their early atmospheric records like &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; or &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; may find themselves really thrown off and even disgusted by the sometimes downright bizarre style of this album but for the adventurous audiences &quot;Zooropa&quot; is an album that is worth checking out! I definitely don't think that it's one of their best albums but I can still say that I really enjoy this fantastic album that does not have any filler tracks. Try it out today and if you like it, buy it! It's a very good album. If you like this album then go and get their &quot;Pop&quot; album as well. Highly Recommended!ngs I haven't mentioned are very good as well but the ones I mentioned deserved the most attention.

0151008116|4.0|Franklin Roosevelt stirred the American people to support his<BR>New Deal programs with these words, and Pi says essentially the same thing early in his journey on a lifeboat with a man-eating tiger.<br />   I loved the way he conquered his fears and used his knowledge of animal-training to survive. I also enjoyed his brief explanation of his ecumenical religious beliefs. <br />    I enjoyed the book until he landed on the island. The fantasies he encountered there and the interview at the end of the book seemed out of place. His explanation of his trip seemed to call into question the story we had read in the first part of the book. Which was true? Perhaps the author is saying that reality is hard to maintain under such conditions. I guess I am too much of a realist to enjoy such an uncertain ending.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears, man, the name just screams attention dosen't it!! I mean, you just get this like big picture of this world wide obsession of a WOMAN who brings you the best in entertainment...always no doubt about it!! The sexiness, the one-woman empire thing goin' on, and a body that Richard Simons would kill for...(haha)!! Now, this 4th album is the hottest thing I've ever heard. She brings you Regae, hip/hop, all mixed with pop. She works with top of the lot artists (vocally) such as Madonna and The Ying Yang Twins. She also sings a song that R. Kelly has written. These songs are definitely orginal and will MOST DEFINITELY be holding the Key to future music!!! HOW exciting!! They are great songs to dance to and to sing, and to just plug into the Car CD and have fun down the highway! I have the CD and let me tell you, if you truly love music and are...the next Britney or Christina...you'll love this music!!
B00008PW2D|3.0|I have seen every episode from the beginning, and like a lot of you agree (...) is too much for only 8 episodes.  But what I am also seeing is a complaint of the 8 shows.  I have to disagree...SITC is not only a comedy, but a chance to get to know the girls.  This season we actually saw Samantha fall in love.  Maybe eveyone is upset b/c it was not funny...I don't always tend to watch them b/c they are funny, but to see what's up.  There have been several episodes that I was sad and cried (Miranda's mom dying).  Some of you have mentioned how ridiculous it is for 40 something women to go after these 20 something sailors (episode 1).  That was the point!!!  I felt sad for them and they knew they were sad for doing it!  I felt like this was a completely true to life season, and maybe you people have a problem with it b/c the reality was too much.  I liked this season and once the price comes down will definately add it to my collection and watch it when I need a good cry, since sometimes that is just as important as a good laugh!

It explains everything that is left in question by the theatrical release and tones down Faramir to a closer rendition of the character in the book.  Basically, he's not so much a bad guy.  I can't say much more than that I love it and it's worth every penny to own.  <br />Also, look for the secret bonus from the MTV awards, it's hysterical!
B0000011P7|3.0|The classic &quot;Give me Aqualung or Death&quot; Tull fans usually savage this disc...and with some understanding.  Walk Into Light is very different, primarily because of the heavy contributions of Peter-John Vetesse's keyboards to Ian's voice and flute.  That said, lyrically, this disc contains some very personal, literate comments and observations.  It's an intelligent album.  This was a worthy experiment that midwifed to the Techno-Tull album Under Wraps, another experiment which when combined with Martin Barre and David Pegg rocked out in a couple places.  Not for everyone and not for me all the time, but it is a testament to Ian Anderson's abilities that he pulled off something so stunningly different.
B000127LW2|4.0|Wake up Star Trek geeks!  Thanks to that company we know and love....Paramount...you're in for a third straight year of spending money on STAR TREK DVD'S!<br />For 2004, you are treated to Star Trek Voyager.  A worthy series introducing Trek's first female captain.  <br />I admit I am a DS9 fan at heart, but there are some great plot lines in Voyager that rival the popular TNG.  I don't think all the characters in Voyager are as well rounded as DS9/TNG, but they do make for a memorable bunch.  <br />Here's to another year of Trek DVD's and all the goodness they provide!
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park. If I could describe them in one word, it would be..different. Though their sound certianly isn't original, their presentation is a breath of fresh air. Their first album, Hybrid Theory, was quite obtuse; they didn't have Limp Bizkit's brashness, Korn's full on angst, or Rage Against The Machine's fluid guitar technicalness,but it's was very enjoyable to listen to. Their second album, Reaminmation is in one word... BRILLIANT! They got a lot of respect from me by basically going against the grain; they ignored what everybody else did with their remix album by getting the hot rappers and producers and going to hip hop's talented and often ignored underground to work with the likes of Dilated Peoples, Jurassic 5 and The Roots(by the way, go buy everything those groups have ever put out; NOW!). Now they have returned with Meteora. My only real complaint is that the album is similar to Hybrid Theory; TOO similar. As a matter of fact, if Meteora's alternate title could be HT 2.0. Mike Shinoda's rapping is too Sesame Street for me; on Reanimation, he showed me that he has REAL skills and can hang with the best of them. Chester Bennington's vocal range is the highlight of the album; I will never tire of him belt out those notes. If Linkin Park can expand their sounds and concepts, and if Bennington and Shinoda can improve the rapping/singing tradeoffs(kind of like a 21st century version of Run-DMC), this band will be around for a while.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Captured by the beautiful image on this cover grabed a copy of the shelf and read precise on the back.Mmmm not a bad sort of story, a little different to the harry average beauty queen gunk.<BR>Had never seen this actress ACTING before and didn't expect much UNTIL her fantastic portrayal of a school girl running through one of the sequences. It took me back to my teenage years her energy and facial expression brilliantly portrayed. Her torturing relationship drew emotion from me both fierce and sympathetic. The pain of injury making you wince as you see a strong character making every effort to cope. Defineately one I am recommending.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana is awful. Kurt Cobain isnt even from seattle although he wishes he was. Everyone with at least half a brain knows that Nirvana doesnt have one good album. They became a completely sappy band. They  deteriotrated to nonsense. They arent even a rock band anymore. Kurt belonged in the same category as those pop fools from american idol. Cobain wasnt half the songwriter Eddie is &amp; was. If kurt were alive today he'd laugh his fans nowadays.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I'm one of those major Beatle fans -- 52 years old with Beatles memorabilia on the wall of my law office.  I loved John Lennon, dislike Yoko Ono, and am not very fond of much that Paul has done since the break up (except for his &quot;interview&quot; with Chris Farley on SNL).  &quot;Let It Be&quot; was never one of my favorite albums. (I also think that Sgt. Pepper has not worn well.)  <br />That being said, this new version is truly a treat.  First of all the sound quality is unbelievable.  It has me all but salivating for a 5.1 release of Abbey Road, Rubber Soul, or Revolver.  The versions of the songs are very sweet.  Let's face facts -- The Beatles were in complete disarray in January 1969 -- as George indicated on &quot;Anthology,&quot; the world had been beating on them without surcease for years.  There is a melancholy that pervades the music.  And yet -- To hear Paul and John sing (oh, how prophetically) &quot;You and I have memories, longer than the road that stretches out ahead&quot; -- Paul says he wrote that for him and Linda, but . . .<br />We all had those magic moments of love, romance, adventure and melodrama in our 20's -- The Beatles just had it 100 times larger than most of us.  Feeling such amazing love and intimacy with a group fade must have been devastating to these amazing men.  That sense is here.  Give this album a fair chance.  It is an amazing document.
6305878323|5.0|I think this movie is terrific,and there is not a thing wrong with it.Julie Andrews well deserved her Oscar, and I think Dick Van Dyke should have got one too.The songs are mesmorizing, and all the actors did a wonderful job. I'd have to say my two favorite songs are \\"Chim-Chimnie\\", and \\"Feed the Birds\\". It's in my top 4 Disney movies of all time.With 101 Dalmatians, Pinochio,and Peter Pan. \\"Mary Poppins\\" is terrific, and a movie the whole family should enjoy.
055357342X|5.0|I'd just like to warn everyone that reviewer nuevovo from Seattle felt the need to type out crucial spoilers in CAPS, rather than give a coherent review of the book. So, if you'd like to find out what happens from the actual author, who can write like a half-decent human being, rather than from this kid, skip over that review.<br />I'm about 700 pages in, (that would make me about halfway through) and other than the fact that the above unintelligent person gave away a huge plot twist that I've yet to reach, I'm loving every page. Rarely does a fantasy series of this volume pay off in the long run (re: Terry Goodkind's early onset megalomania personified in Naked Empire, Robert Jordan's WOT, etc) but I can honestly say that Martin should have his name etched on every modern fantasy trophy in existence. He even chooses a difficult mode of narration (switching through several perspectives; one per chapter) and still manages to make an engaging, deeply characterized, intricate and really captivating piece of literature.<br />Read it, if you'd like to delve into fantasy out of curiosity but don't want to wade through the repetitive trash that clogs the genre.<br />Read it, for sure, if you consider yourself a hardcore fantasy buff!
B00009TB5G|1.0|If you expect the appendices with the Two Towers to play on a DVD as did the appendices included with the Fellowship Of The Ring, you will be disappointed. The two extra disks are nothing more than coasters. They will not play on a standard DVD player.
B000062XE1|4.0|I know this is supposed to be a review, but I don't actually have the dvd collection so I guess I'm not in a position to comment on the picture quality etc. <br />I have a problem with \\"The Oscar Wilde Collection\\" and I wondered if anyone could answer my question. Like most people, when I see a dvd or box set that I like, I will look on different web sites for the best price. I do know all the films listed on the Oscar Wilde Collection, but my question is why do different web sites have the same \\"The Oscar Wilde Collection\\", but they state different versions of the films that are listed on this site? <br />I just looked at one site and this is what they say:<BR>\\"Description for The Oscar Wilde Collection DVD<BR>--A collection of films based on the works of Oscar Wilde. Includes AN IDEAL HUSBAND (1969) directed by Rudolph Cartier; LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN (1925) directed by Ernst Lubitsch; THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST (1952) directed by Anthony Asquith; and THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (1945, Color) directed by Albert Lewin.\\"<br />That above info for this dvd set was clearly stated (as you can see) and it also had the very same pic of the dvd box cover as we see on this site. If you read the above you'll see it listed the years the films were made and yes those particular films were made in those years (I looked it up). If you read the descriptions on this site you get the same films, same photo of dvd box cover, but different dates when the films were made (much later). Are the films in this dvd set the old ones we all know (from years 1925-1969) or are they later re-makes? I would be very grateful if someone could explain what's going on before I actually buy the set.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|If you see the movie, you have to buy the soundtrack.  This movie sticks in your head, as will the music.  But.... Kill Bill Vol. 2 is coming out in February 04 &amp; with it another soundtrack and eventually (one would think) a two CD set.  Quentin Tarantino has the habit of maxing out the merchandising on his movies- which is strange, because it is all adult entertainment- so you may wish to wait for the final version next year.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston is so blessed. It's a shame that most of us agree that she is not at the top of her game, Yet she sounds better than anyone out there, whoa!! Sad for them. This CD is very soothing to the soul, it's very moving. Her voice is mature and heavy now, she sounds like a mother and a wife, a sister and a best friend. She just sounds so wise and &quot;been there and done that&quot;, if you know what I mean. Her voice is strong, the production of the music is top notch and the song selection is perfect. It's a must have, Whitney fan or not. She's on her way back. It will not happen over night but she is definitely on the right path, just listen and you'll HEAR it. God Bless!

B00005JMFO|5.0|...this movie would be my choice for 2003. It's a perfect \\"forget your troubles\\" kind of film with a cast so good and characters so likeable it's no effort at all to suspend your disbelief and emotionally dive right in. That's not to say it's complete fluff; the message (a lesson on the myriad forms, stages and costs of love) is very real and very important, but it's delivered with a spoonful of sugar rather than a syringe. A highly recommended antidote to the cynicism one is apt to pick up while doing the holiday shopping.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is definitely one of the best animated movies of all time. After years of inactivity Walt Disney studios came back with this masterpiece. Everything on it is excellent; the lyrics for the songs are among the best. This movie combines cuteness and funny moments (BTW try to see Sebastian talking like Cuban in Spanish it is simply hilarious and much more fun than in English!). Definitely a MUST have for any collector. I simply love it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version is the only version that you should watch or, I believe, that should be shown in theaters.  The added footage completes a number of dangling elements that clearly were in Jackson's mind originally but that for various reasons were left out.  We learn of Faramir's familial status and his relationship with Boromir (as well as a great deal more of Boromir's motivation in joining the Fellowship), the extent to which Wormtongue has consolidated his power, and of the possibility of more sparks between Eowyn and Aragorn.<br />I believe the extended version, just like its predecessor for Fellowship of the Ring, accomplishes a number of things:<br />1)  It clearly demonstrates the respect Jackson has for the underlying works.  He picks up on nuances and plotlines that I think most of the self-crowned 'purists' miss.<br />2)  It shows that whatever side points are missing from the film are missing for a reason.  They were not left out due to laziness or inattention to detail; quite the opposite.  Jackson has obviously made tactical decisions about what to include and what not to, which is far better than having the marketing department pick the parts that lend themselves to making the best action figures.<br />Jackson has really hit his stride with the second film, and the extended version is the definitive version to see.  I believe the sole reason lesser versions are released to theaters is due to the running times of the film rather than some effort to expand DVD sales; perhaps the Return of the King will receive its full due.  In the interim, I recommend the extended versions of both Fellowship of the Ring and the Two Towers as representative of the best Hollywood has to offer.
B000062X90|3.0|i was unfamiliar with wishbone ash - although much of the hippy-blues rock music of this era fills my collection - so i snared this disc recently - and i'm pleased - these guys played their music because they loved it - they were obviously unconcerned with the critics of their time or with 'making the radio' - they just love the music - and you can get that 'feel' as you listen - the 'muse' plays within them - this is good music - if you like music played simply for the sake of the music (not the 'almighty dollar' or to 'hit the charts') then buy this - if you want catchy music with little jingles you can whistle while you're at work - then why are you at a wishbone ash page?<BR>space puppy out
B000002I27|5.0|Strange Days is the Doors followup to their phenomenal first album, and music fans will find it every bit as passionate and engaging, and will want to add it to their collections accordingly. The title track reportedly boasts one of the first uses of Moog synthesizer in rock (I still wish I knew what caused the unique echo effect so prevalent on Morrison's vocal tracks; is that Moog as well?) and first-rate lyrics and vocals by Jim Morrison, and, as always, incredible keyboards by Ray Manzerak. Jim wrote the etherial &quot;You're Lost Little Girl&quot; for Frank Sinatra to sing to Mia Farrow; memorable guitar figures by Robbie Krieger on this track. &quot;Love Me Two Times,&quot; is the party anthem of the album, an out-and-out rocker. &quot;Unhappy Girl&quot; gets it's unusual piano sound from the fact that Ray is playing backwards (!) and then spliced the solo onto the track. &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; is a spoken-word track, filled with eerie wailing and sound effects, and concerns the little-known fact that sailing ships used to release their cargo of animals when they were becalmed in the Horse Latitudes area of the Atlantic Ocean; the effect was to lighten the load enough so they could catch a breeze and sail again. The horrific incident is best captured in the line &quot;mute nostril agony,&quot; which perfectly shows the incredible pain the horses must be feeling as they swim for their lives. &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; contains some of the album's most beautiful and vivid imagery and is very much a companion piece to &quot;Crystal Ship&quot; from the first album. &quot;People Are Strange&quot; is absolutely hypnotic and features a wonderfully understated vocal by Jim. &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot; is another feast for Robbie's guitar playing, as Jim gazes at the city &quot;under television skies.&quot; &quot;I Can't See Your Face in My Mind&quot; has a lovely Japanese feel, with koto-string effects. Finally, &quot;When the Music's Over&quot; is the lengthy rabble-rouser that closes the set; John Densmore's drums are the highlight here, particularly his mid-song interplay with Jim's vocals. This is the first of several Doors &quot;revolutionary&quot; songs; &quot;Five to One&quot; will continue the theme on the band's next album, Waiting for the Sun. It is also structured like an orchestral piece, with slow-build up, first climax, slowing down, then very quiet, before an all-out assault of the senses at the end. Absolutely stunning!!! Throughout, as with the first album, the lyrics deal with self-discovery and invention, trying to find a place for oneself in this world, and of course, the meaning of it all. So again, if self-discovery is an ongoing, even daily process for you, then waste no time in adding Strange Days to your collection. After all, you don't need to turn out the light when the music's over, you can simply listen to it again and again!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I have to wonder if some people who wrote reviews below really know the album. First, original album version of &quot;get Back&quot; has no coda at the end (unlike the single version), the naked version preserves the integrity of the original album version. &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;I've got a feeling&quot; on Phil Spector mixes do not have an orchestra back up in the first place, the naked version sounds very close to the original mixed with added clarity, warmth and intimacy that lacked on both LP and early CD remastered. The order of the songs in this new Let It Be is much better than the original. The two junks song from Lennon were removed (he didn't want them to included in the album in the first place, do you know that? but Phil decided to added them) and replaced with a much deserved Lennon's song &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot;. Overall, it's a great album in anew clarity. Don't miss it!
B000005HFH|5.0|The guy cant sing? The guy is a so-so jazz trumpter? Well put him together, with his history, his mind and talent - man can he do it well . The music I get from this is outstanding. The tracks are so well put together. In fact I am more a fan of his trumpet playing, so much that when I listen to any of these tracks, the volume on my stereo goes up everytime he starts his solo bits. The accompanying musicians are excellent too. More than worth a buy. In fact this is an essential collection item.
B00003CXD5|5.0|mr . Cerasini, if you don't like this movie, why even bother to show up on this review site....your assesment of this classic movie is so full of spite and totally ludicrous on ALL accounts, it's laughable.....I guess you feel a little better and smarter by having given a contradictory opinion to almost all of the cinema going public and critcs, have you ? See, now I've done the same as you, a vile little piece of critical pap...what a waste of my time....
B000002C1W|4.0|I never thought that Pink Floyd could make something good after the Split. Roger Waters, the musical genious behind everything left and did a most stunning soloalbum &quot;The Pros&amp;Cons of Hitchhiking&quot;, leaving Gilmour and Company with a new and different Pink Floyd. A Pink Floyd not pretending to be the old one. In fact, they never had a chance, because there isnt anyone in the world close to Waters sarcastic, self-ironic and beautiful style. So, with that in mind, they made a Next Generation Pink Floyd. <br />A Momentary Lapse of Reason is, although not perfect, a very original and good album. Its very atmospheric, blue and melancholy, yet keeping the rock and alternative style they were known for. Some songs are radiofriendly, and earned them quite some radioplay, like &quot;Learning to Fly&quot;, while others are downright strange, and have no place on a Commercial Radio Channel, unless you wanna lift some eyebrows. The three best songs on the album: &quot;On the Turning Away&quot; with its almost anthem like chorus, &quot;Yet Another Movie&quot; with a haunting style and sound and &quot;Sorrow&quot; which sounds like some dark and sad Rocker, heavily on the guitars but keeping a strange and fascinating sound.<br />The rest of the songs are good, except the very unnecessary &quot;A New Machine&quot; which keeps the record a bit disturbing. Still, it is part of what makes this record so unique. The next album &quot;The Divison Bell&quot; makes Pink Floyd fully commercial, losing some of the individuality but winning a lot on the ears. Yet, A Momentary Lapse of Reason is a proof that David Gilmour and Company didnt need Roger Waters to make a good album. Its a shame that more people doesnt see this record for what it is. They could never make it sound like the old Pink Floyd, and they should be given credits for having guts to try something new, yet staying away from cookiecutting. <br />Yes, A Momentary Lapse of Reason could have used some trimming, replacing some songs with better ones, but all in all, its a good album which I recommend to most.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Awful!  This cd stinks!  Almost every song starts with her talking into the microphone.  Many songs, you also hear her heavy breathing or laughing in the background.  The songs are so digitalized that you never hear her actually singing, and when she does sing, she sounds like she's 12.  Lyrics include \\"When I'm shaking my ass\\", \\"outrageous, my sex drive\\", \\"my sexy jeans\\".  Yuck, yuck, yuck!!!!
B00005JKN9|3.0|Daniel Day Lewis. This man was what salvaged this film for me, it would have turned into a flop had he not been cast as the butcher. What was Scorsese thinking when he turned what would have been an excellent film about honor, revenge and life in the early days of New York into a chick flick? Diaz and Di Caprio gave the film a Hollywood feel, and whenever a film has Hollywood stamped all over it, you can kiss goodbye to reality.<br />However the film was not all bad. The plot was entertaining, and the set was wonderful. They did a great job in trying to recreate the look of the Old New York. The fight scenes were OK, no Brave heart but still quite realistic. <br />The subplot of the draft riots tended to shift the focus from the main story and instead of making the movie more interesting, it made it unnecessarily complicated. It was like one of those things that directors add to get marks for historical accuracy. It didn't fit in too well with the main plot and they would have done better by giving it less emphasis or excluding it altogether. For a movie of its length you expect there to be a gripping story, and a memorable theme. \\"Gangs\\" fails to impress on both counts. <br />Overall it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't one of the best either. Definitely not a must see.
B00004I9VE|5.0|This is totally the greatest album of all time. I love it.Shame on those people who posted earlier reviews that said they don't like Michael Jackson because he sleeps with other boys. well I guess Michael is right, when ya'll think of \\"bed\\", you think sexual! Why cant people just think something positive for once. at least for a very generous person who wouldnt do such thing. so Shame on ya'll who are against Michael jackson!MICHAEL IS TRULY THE GREATEST!!!
0062502182|3.0|Last year, a student of mine declared this to be a favourite book. I asked to borrow it... someday. You see, I always have so many books sitting on my shelf, waiting to be read. And this one is such a slim volume; I figured, `How long could it possibly take me to read it? Best to save it for sometime when I can whip through it quickly, and have no other books to worry about.'<br />Fast forward to this year. I still hadn't read it! So finally, we both got our acts together, and I borrowed _The Alchemist_, which I read, as I predicted, very quickly. <br />It's both simple and thoughtful at the same time, a quality it shares with another fable, _The Little Prince_. As in St Exupery's book, the innocence of the protagonist is both endearing and bewildering. His quest to live out his dreams and his potential takes on mythical and metaphysical overtones - sometimes overly amorphous for my tastes. Yet the ending recalls the homely simplicity of the lesson Dorothy learns at the end of _The Wizard of Oz_. <br />It didn't thrill or thoroughly absorb me, but I can easily understand why the student who lent me this novel returns to it again and again whenever she wants to reassert her sense of wonder and optimism.
B00004WGAK|4.0|It is very frustrating when reviewers do not specify which version of the film they are reviewing, or in some cases distinguish between the film and the medium they watched it on. In the case of One-Eyed Jacks, there are at least seven different DVDs to choose between, yet all reviews are the same for each version. So, which version is trash and which is not??<BR>PS. My star rating applies to the FILM, not any DVD, as I have only seen the film on TV.<BR>Where the hell did I mention voting buttons?
B000002UAR|3.0|It is amazing to me that so many can blindly believe that everything the Beatles release is genius, and not realize how truly behind the times and unexperimental this album(and the rest of the Beatles canon for that matter) is.  Songs like Eleanor Rigby and For No One are pretty little pop songs, but it is nonsense to try to convince yourself that they are works of genius just because they are Beatles songs.  I don't feel this way just for the sake of being different.  I honestly do not see genius in this album.  I like the Beatles to an extent- they are a fun little pop band.  But there is no way I would consider them or this album in any greatest bands or albums list.  Those of you who gave this a 5 star review really must be missing out on alot of great music.  Give a serious listen to some truly great bands such as the Velvet Underground, the Doors, Captain Beefheart, Pere Ubu, and many others before you start declaring an album full of 3 minute pop ditties the greatest rock album of all time.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|would have been a better title. What mastermind thought this one up? Why was &quot;Dig It&quot; removed? I longed to have the full version on CD of this creative burst of energy, not its absence. Actually, if the &quot;corporation&quot; or whatever put this thing out wanted to put out something different, the George Martin proposed 1968 album of these sessions has always been my preferred choice, if not the Beatles (let's face it, though, they couldn't agree on anything at the time, anyway). True, this version lacked &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot;--instead consisting of &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; &quot;Teddy Boy (a better version than on Paul's first) and a 5 min. take of &quot;Dig It&quot;--these missing elements could've always been included as bonus tracks or inserted somewhere. Attention please corporate owners of music: don't rewrite history. Why not try again &quot;letting it be&quot; one more time by &quot;getting back&quot; to the way it was, but, next time, add more to it (e.g., music). Thanks for the crisp mixes, though.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a must have for all shania fans. There was such a great energy that shania gave off at this concert. She really gave a 5 star performance. Bringing people up on stage and going down in the crowd and singing to a fan. It is all these things and more that make this DVD special a must have. One of Shania's best performances ever!!!!
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is by far probably the best book I have ever read. This thriller sets the hook of all hooks and drags the reader along. I couldn't put it down. I was on my computer researching the historical information from the painting just to see that they were true! Dan Brown is pure genius!
156898443X|5.0|Every time I get annoyed at something small I think of Danny Gregory's book.  Everyday Matters makes you feel glad for the little things in life.

B000062Y98|5.0|This is the latest album I've bought from Blind Guardian. I've gotta say it's very impressive. I had read a couple reviews about the album and I was a little skeptical. But being the big BG fan that I am I doubted that BG would put out a bad cd. So it took about a listen or two but the album really clicked. I can't say that this is one of the favorite albums by the Bards but its a memorable one. Something to complete your BG collection. If you're new to this band I wouldn't recommend starting out with this cd. First get either Tales from the Twilight World or Imaginations from the Other Side.<BR>Stay Metal!

And it's starting to seriously deteriorate. <br />Where and when the hell is the original??...
B000066NW0|5.0|Um, dreamcatcher I believe it was... nice review of this CD except, where do you come up with she doesn't write her own lyrics? That drives me insane! Do you have any idea what you are talking about? She DOES write her own lyrics for your information and as long as you can play the guitar well I don't have a problem with the other comment, if you don't then, that's your problem. Plus, how hard is it to spell her name? L-A-V-I-G-N-E Okay, that's all. And I'm not being rude or anything, just correcting you on a few things that disturbed me. And on the CD, I like the lyrics, which were written by her unless she made that up, I think she's a good singer, and her guitar playing skills are fine with me. I don't know how to play the guitar so I can't judge her skills. Plus, she has a guitar player, she's not really the one who's supposed to be able to play, she's the singer in the band.

In fact, my mother and her school friends used to put rocks in their shoes as they walked to school.<br />I recognize that this novel is fiction, what I took from this book was simply the possibility of an alternative to what I was brought up to believe (see 1st paragraph).  History itself is really the perceptions of those who wrote the books, why not the bible as well?  As a born catholic, I feel blasphemous for that comment, but why can't worship grant free thinking without fear of condemnation?
B00005YW4H|1.0|It is beyond me how this CD sold 8 million copies but that being said I should be in the studio now. I am a talented entertainer and I could produce a better product on my worst day.  I am not trying to be arrogant but this work is methodic without any variations.  I am quite disappointed that I bought it.  The only track worth it's salt is the single that was played on the radio.<BR>Good Luck.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I've been a Beatles fan for quite some time now and have just about everything they've ever released on vinyl and cd.  One of my all time favorite Beatles albums is Let It Be.  I've always liked it because of emotion behind it.  This version is more of a &quot;bare bones&quot; version.  Clean and real.  I highly reccomend it.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce is what all those other B*****'* wish they could be.   That is all to it.  Just be honest with yourself ......you know i'm right.  Just think if you had it goin' on like that.  Ha-- Ha.  It's ugly.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|this is the raw power of RUSH enjoying the synergy of perfection. this is one of the best collections of music I have ever heard. RUSH celebrates their artistry in supreme style, and class. [although I believe they have been a class by themselves for many years.] their audiences at these recording can easily be heard agreeing whole-heartedly! I knew this would be Something Special when I heard the first few seconds of Tom Sawyer. <br />For RUSH fans, this is highly recommended material. I have been a fan of theirs since the early to mid '70s, and they just keep getting better. thankfully they still break new ground with each stage in their decades' long career. and in the world of 'corporate produced' it-all-sounds-alike music drivel, RUSH's sounds are as fresh today as when originally released. their new material still soars, and blossoms with inventiveness that artists of this day often cannot find, buy, or copy. <br />2nd comment: <br />This offering is best listened to with <br />Industrial <br />Strength<BR> <BR>Headphones!!
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Last year: a live album from Paul with Beatles songs credited to McCartney-Lennon.  This year: a Beatles album re-released with John Lennon content removed. Paul: this is so disillusioning.  How sad.
B00005KARJ|5.0|DUMBO is my favorite Disney film.  Although  is it barely 1 hour long, it is packed with complex themes and gorgeous animation, far beyond what was being done 60 years ago.  DUMBO is a dark film, with echos of film noir.  It is frequently raining or snowing, and much of the action takes place at night.  Although much has been written about the hallucinatory &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; number, my favorite sequence (in fact, my all-time favorite Disney animated sequence) is the erecting of the circus tent scene.  During the pouring rain, the circus workers, assisted by the elephants, put up the tent in a fantastic ballet of social realism, echoing the best of Ben Shahn and Diego Rivera.  The animation swings around the scene, taking in only an arm here, a swinging hammer there.  Topped by that swirling soundtrack, this scene is the best that Disney has ever done.  The story may, at times be a bit too intense for younger viewers, but no more so than other Disney films where parents die (e.g., Bambi), or tense moments occur.  On top of it all, the main character never speaks a word.  This ain't no &quot;bare necessities&quot; film, rather, it is simply a work of art.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera is absolutemly amazing. I dont always agree with how she markets herself...but she is being herself and not holding back on anyone's behalf...shes real and thats what I love about her. Not only is her style real, but so is her talent. Unlike other computerized artists (i wont name names) Christina can belt it out and her newest album, Stripped, proves just that.<br />1) Stripped intro - has a cool sound to it, a solid start to the album (8/10)<BR>2) Cant Hold Us Down (featuring Lil Kim) - This song is so much fun to listen to and sing along to...lil kim and christina make a great team (9/10)<BR>3) Walk Away - I love this ballad- its beautifully sung and the lyrics are incredible (10/10)<BR>4) Fighter - This song never gets old it always gets me on my feat (10/10)<BR>5) Infatuation (interlude) - this clip is very \\"exotic\\" sounding and gets you ready for the next song (7/10)<BR>6) Infatuation - This is one of my favorite songs on the album because it is so different than anything else out there right now...very exotic (10/10)<BR>7) Loving me For Me (interlude) - very slowbeat and relaxing (7/10)<BR>8) Loving Me for Me - Very relaxing song - Christina's voice is soothing and the lyrics are beautiful (8/10)<BR>9) Impossible - By far one of my favorite songs on this album - Christina teams up with Alicia Keys and the overflow of Talent definitely shows - the vocals are awesome and Christina belts it out like there is no tomorrow (11/10)<BR>10) Underpreciated - definitely an awesome song - the music and the lyrics are incredible and the feeling behind Christina's voice is right on target (10/10)<BR>11) Beautiful - The lyrics in this song are absolutely unbelievable - not only are they amazing but its terrific that a popstar like Christina puts the message out there not to change who you are because you are beautiful already (10/10)<BR>12) Make Over - Not a girly makeup song or anything like that - this song is one to rock out to and has a hardcore soundto it...(8/10)<BR>13) Cruz - Awesome ballad and very well done (10/10)<BR>14) Soar - Great lyrics, a great message, and unbelievable vocals (10/10)<BR>15) Get Mine, Get Yours - a very sexual song that is a bit extreme from what we usually hear, but for some reason, even though it is so scandalous, you find yourself listening to it over and over again (9/10)<BR>16) Dirrty - A great party song that you can listen to over and over again and is sure to get you on the dance floor(9/10)<BR>17) Stripped Part 2 - I love this clip - the message is so...strong...its hard to explain but its awesome (10/10)<BR>18) A Voice Within - Christina has great vocals, great lyrics, and together you get an amazing song with a lot of feeling behind it (10/10)<BR>19) Im OK - this song was hard for Christina to write Im sure - its so personal and its amazing that she lets us into her life and her heart and belts it out ABSOLUTELY AMAZING...

B00003CXBK|5.0|A film by Hayao Miyazaki<br />This is probably the best Miyazaki film that I have seen.  It rivals Kiki's Delivery Service for having a story that I could get involved in and truly enjoy, but it also surpasses Spirited Away in terms of quality and storytelling craft (in my view).  Kiki's Delivery Service used to be my favorite Miyazaki film, but I believe that has now changed.  Princess Mononoke is a superior film.<br />This is a fairly complex story about technology vs nature.  Near the beginning there is a boar which appears to be covered in some kind of grub worms.  Wherever the boar steps, the grass and trees die.  The boar is on a rampage and when it appear that the boar is headed for his village, Ashitaka (Billy Crudup) is forced to attack and kill the boar.  Only then does Ashitaka learn that the boar was really a forest god turned demon.  Ashitaka was infected and the iron ball that was the poison inside the boar is also going to poison and kill Ashitaka.  Ashitaka heads to the west to find out how to seek out the Great Forest Spirit and find a way to cure this poison.<br />Ashitaka finds his way to Iron Town and meets the leader, Lady Eboshi (Minnie Driver).  Eboshi initially seems to be the villain, but as we get to learn more about her we see that she is not a villain, but rather simply human.  She is destroying the environment to create iron weapons and materials, but she has also rescued prostitutes from brothels and takes care of them.  She is both sympathetic as well as a harbinger of destruction.  Eboshi has a nemesis in a young girl living with the wolves named San (Claire Danes).  San has been raised by the wolf gods and is fighting to preserve the forest and the gods.  Ashitaka sees the good in both, even if neither San nor Eboshi can see the positives in the other.<br />I have only touched on the surface of the depth of this movie.  It is a story so big that it could only be told in animation (I just don't think that live action could have succeeded with this story).  The animation is beautiful, if a little graphic at times with the violence. This is definitely not children's animation.  Besides being one of the best films of Miyazaki's career, I would rate this as a great movie.  Period.  Forget about it being a great animated movie, this is a great movie.  Princess Mononoke also features the voice talent of Gillian Anderson, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Billy Bob Thornton (who does a fantastic job).  This is a must see.succeeded with this story).

B0000CAXIC|5.0|Wow! What can I NOT say about how good this record is? Released in 1997, it showed us that the Foo's weren't going away unless they were kicking and screaming. Grohl, former drummer for the great Nirvana, pounds out great riffs faster than you can say &quot;Doll&quot;. Monkey Wrench: great great song. Hey Johnny Park!: GREAT drum intro!! The rest is post grunge perfection. I dare you to find a bad song on here!  I DARE YOU!!!!!
B0000062FN|5.0|As 1971 was the original release for this material - makes the music within Santana III all the more amazing. If you are a Santana fan, this is a MUST!!! Self-produced, the Santana Band harnessed emotional elements of many musical sources. The recording is dated but the content is timeless.  Neal Schon definitely shines and brings new life to a nucleus that was at it's peak. From 'Batuka' to 'Para Los Rumberos', this material showcases hybrid music at it's best. Uniquely Santana!  Outstanding performances on 'Taboo', 'Toussaint L'Overture' and 'Guajira' make this a monumental classic. The live tracks (on the re-release) are just gravy.  And, YES! that means it is a worthwhile purchase.
B000089RVX|5.0|Dark, eerie and heavy beats; you might think I am talking about Linking Park or Limp Bizkit, but what I am really talking about is a band from Little Rock, Arkansas. This epic band called Evanescence consists of: Amy Lee on vocals; Ben Moody on lead guitar; John Lecompt on guitar; and Rocky Gray on drums. Wondering what Evanescence means? Well, according to the band, it means a dissipation or disappearance like vapor. Do not worry Evanescence fans--, although it may imply a disappearance, they reassure that they are here to stay. <BR> The majority of the CD, Fallen has a unique sound: a cross of Nine-Inch Nails meets Jewel. Amy Lee's angelic voice and her talented gift of song-writing combined with heavy guitar work from Ben Moody, striking rhythms from John LeCompt and Rocky Gray gives the CD incredible hooks and choruses. You might have heard their first single, Bring Me to Life along with an additional song, My Immortal, in the action packed film starting Ben Affleck, Daredevil.<br />All the tracks on this CD make you want to sing along to Amy Lee's powerful, deep lyrics.  For instance hot new release Going Under, <BR>\\"Now I will tell you what I've done for you <BR>50 thousand tears I've cried <BR>screaming deceiving and bleeding for you <BR>and still you won't hear me....\\"<BR>Evanescence's new release, Going Under is even hotter, with an opening that leaves you wanting more. If these songs do not make you hit repeat then other songs on the album like, Everybody's Fool, Tourniquet, or Whisper, will. There is no question that this striking gothic metal band has the hottest CD out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Why are you people so biased? Give the girl a chance, don't make so many assumptions and listen to the album without any preconceptions. It's ok, Britney has not been a truly innovative artist, but with this album she shows the world that she's a great performer. The music is hot. Totally original and really good. GIVE THE GIRL A CHANCE. LISTEN TO THIS AWESOME ALBUM.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|A fabulous soundtrack to complemente a fabulous movie. Kelly Clarkson's The Trouble with Love is one of the best tracks, Norah Jones, Wyclef Jean and Jonie Mitchell are great. The addition of Jump (for My Love) and The Pointer Sisters is a feel good over the top track that reminds us of one of the funniests moments of the movie. Definately a most have!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is a perfect example of an album that grows as you listen to it. It's another incredible album but it doesn't sound the same because Mer de Noms was all songs written by Billy Howerdel and this album features more collaboration. Definitely a departure from Mer de Noms, the album takes a subtler approach then its predecessor.  <br />It starts out rocking with &quot;The Package&quot; and &quot;Weak and Powerless,&quot; which APC did a video for. Then the album slows down for more ambient with songs like &quot;Crimes,&quot; and &quot;The Nurse That Loved Me.&quot; It then flips back to rocking, especially with &quot;Pet,&quot; which is possibly the closest to Tool in sound and lyrical content than any other song A Perfect Circle has done.<br />As other reviewers have pointed out, &quot;The Nurse That Loved Me,&quot; is a cover, but it would be silly to get mad about considering that Tool had a history of playing shows with Failure when they were still in LA and guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, who worked on Mer de Noms, was a member of Failure. If you like the song, defiantly check out the original so you can see how A Perfect Circle very much made it their own.<br />Oh, and if you're trying those sample things that Amazon offers, make sure to try both &quot;The Package,&quot; and &quot;Noose,&quot; for a good feel as to how the album sounds.
B00009TB5G|5.0|As a Tolkien fan who first read the LOTR over 15 years ago (and has re-read it every year since) I found the extended version of the movie to be infinately more satisfying than the theatrical release.  <br />The first thing I noticed and really enjoyed was the fact that they fleshed out Faramir in this version and we are told on disc three why they changed his character around.  This really helps those of us who don't like change (purists) see what the film makers were thinking.  In the movie Faramir grows from someone who wants to use the ring into someone who realizes its evil.  <br />The second thing which I enjoyed was the love story between Arwen and Aragorn and the fact that we now get to see what is going on between them.  If you read the appendicies of the books you know about the love Aragorn has for Arwen, and you know how it ends, but you don't get to see how it grows and what obstacles it must over come.  <br />Finally, the bonus material explains WHY they ended where they did.  I was disappointed we didn't get to see Shelob and I was worried she might end up on the cutting room floor.  Of course that couldn't be further from the truth.<br />If you want to see the movie as it should have been, then get this dvd.  I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B00005K3O0|4.0|Audrey Rose. Who or what is Audrey Rose? Is it a demon? Is it a ghost? No. Audrey Rose a little girl. A little girl who died a tragic death and maybe living in another body of another girl...... <br />Meet the Templetons. Janice and Bill. They live in a high-class New York apartment building with their 11-year-old daughter, Ivy. Suddenly, Ivy's personality has changed. She's not acting 11. But acting like a 5 year old. And she's been having a sleepwalking problem too. She'll get up (though, obviously sleeping) and run around her room screaming \\"Mommydaddymommydaddyhot!hot!hot!\\" and has even scorched her hands on some invisible hot fire. <br />Enter Elliot Hoover. A middle aged mysterious man who follows Janice and Ivy home from school every day. But he stays far behind them. Every day, Janice worries that the mysterious man is going to attack her. <br />One day, Elliot finally gets the chance to tell Janice and Bill something that has been bothering him. He believes that their daughter Ivy is a reincarnation of his dead child, Audrey Rose. You see, she was in the car that his wife was driving when it skidded off the road and into a ditch below where it caught on fire.He tells them that he moved into town around around the same time that Ivy has had her night fits. Suddenly, from the upstairs of their apartment, Ivy has another fit, screaming \\"Mommydaddymommydaddyhot!hot!hot!\\" The Templeton's are horrified to discover that the only way to calm her down is for Hoover to say \\"Audrey! Audrey Rose! It's daddy! It's daddy!\\" until she falls asleep peacefully. The Templeton's tell Hoover not to return to their apartment and to leave them alone. <br />After countless attemps to contact the Templeton's, Elliot kidnaps Ivy and is arrested. During a court battle, Ivy is taken away from her regular school and is brought to a Catholic Elementary where there will be no reports covering the possible \\"reincarnated girl\\". During that time, Ivy is upset because all the girls tease herafter sneeking in a newspaper with Ivy on the front. During a special holiday event at the school, the children build a gigantic snowman and dance around it singing \\"Old man winter go away! Don't come back till Christmas day\\" Ivy is forced by Audrey Rose to walk into the fire and kill herself, but is stopped by a nun. Meanwhile, the trial is still going on and a witness who was in the car accident (the trial is now about reincarnation and if Elliot was right) said the last words she heard Audrey Rose say was \\"Mommydaddymommydaddyhot!hot!hot!\\". <br />Ivy is taken out of the school and Janice believes that Ivy is really Audrey Rose from the second she was born. Bill doesn't. Elliot is found \\"Innocent\\" and Janice agrees to Elliot's decision to put her under hypnosis to see what she can remember. It is done live on tv. Suddenly, Janice is startled when they go back in Ivy's memory to discover Audrey Rose yelling \\"Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!Hot!\\" constantly. They try to take her off the hypnosis quickly, because if she doesn't snap out of it soon: she'll die. <br />RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF: <BR>The Exorcist (1973) <BR>The Omen (1976) <BR>Rosemary's Baby (1968) <br />CAST <br />Marsha Mason......Janice Templeton <BR>John Beck.............Bill Templeton <BR>Anthony Hopkins..Elliot Hoover <BR>Susan Swift..........Ivy Templeton <br />THE MOVIE 3/4 <br />THE PICTURE QUALITY: 6/10: Some sparkles. It's presented in a matted 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. <br />THE AUDIO QUALITY: 6/10: Mono soundtrack. There is Spanish and French language tracks, both mono as well.

B0000DJZA5|2.0|I've been an die-hard Beatles fan since the age of 13, since 1965 to be precise, and albums like Rubber Soul and Revolver still get a listen from me every week or so. These guys truly changed my life in all aspects and set me on a course which would never have occurred without them - in a very positive way, I mean. I'd possibly be a complete square if they hadn't come along with their spirit of rebellion, cheekiness and genius. They gave me the strength to do what I really wanted, and I did.<br />Now, until recently I'd owned all the Beatles' albums with the sole exception of &quot;Let it Be&quot;. That particular album never really appealed to me; it kind of felt disspirited, disjointed, and the Beatles being at odds with each other during the recording somehow made it a painful listening experience. My heroes were becoming human, all too human, and it hurt. <BR>So, when I learnt that a &quot;new&quot;, &quot;the real&quot; version of the album was to be released I ordered it blindly from my local record store in Bangkok. But what a disappointment! The songs do sound &quot;naked&quot;, yes indeed, but at the same time stripped bare of any essence, substance or strength. They're bland. As someone else here said, they just sound like demos - demos of a very good band with great songwriters, no doubt, but just demos. Nothing more. The one thing that this album triggered off in me is the urge to finally get the original version of the album. Only now do I understand what a great salvage job Phil Spector did on the material he was given. &quot;Let it Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; sound majestic on the original version - here they come across like a half-baked practice sessions. The same goes for &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. Drab. Nothing will ever turn me away from the Beatles, mind you, nothing until my dying bed, but the truth has to be told ... We all have weak moments, by why present them to a paying public which cherishes the Beatles as the biggest musical geniuses in centuries? This album should never have been released. Long live the &quot;real&quot; Beatles!
B000000XB9|4.0|Be it the guitar playing, or &quot;John Fogerty's&quot; voice, there's no doubt &quot;Creedence Clearwater Revival&quot; have a very recognizable sound. You won't mistake them for anyone else. I've always enjoyed listening to them no matter what musical phase I was in at the time. This is 20 of their best. It includes the classics &quot;Susie Q&quot;, &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, and &quot;Have You Ever Seen The Rain&quot;, among others. My favorites would have to be &quot;Green River&quot;, &quot;Run Through The Jungle&quot;, and &quot;Lookin' Out My Backdoor&quot;. You can't beat those. Something about listening to &quot;CCR&quot; always reminds me of my youth, watching the muddy Mississippi flow by. They might do something similar for you.
B000127LW2|4.0|Finally Voyager comes home on DVD. Priced just like the previous DS9 sets, we can expect these season sets to come out every other month for the year of 2004.<br />Star Trek Voyager. What can I say really? I was there at the beginning, and watched the entire series, minus a few eps. It's the story of a starship lost in the Delta quadrant, trying to form new alliances, and avoid the Borg, on their way home. Yes, it had it's ups and downs. Yes they brought in a hot chick to play a borg by mid-series. Many will claim Voyager is horrible, when the simple fact is it's not. It's actually pretty good. It's just a little different from the Treks we're used to. Great characters for me were Tuvok the vulcan, and the Holo-doctor. I really don't know what else to say, except Borg Queen, Species 8472, Viddians. :)<br />The bonus material on this first set is meaty to say the least. There's all kinds of behind the scenes stuff, plus the long awaited and often wished for, never aired Bujold as Janeway footage. This alone should be worth the money for the first set.
B0000029GA|5.0|An amazing rap cd. The lyrics are the best that I have heard on any rap CD. The beats are dope too. This CD will go down as a rap classic for the ages.
B000000JO3|5.0|This cd looks sweet but is it just a group thats starting up and the guitar over powers the lyrics. Is it like the screaming in brand new or billy talent (thats good) or does it suck i need answers.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|The oldest dismissal line for filmed adaptaions of books, be the books well-written or otherwise is that &quot;the book was better&quot;.<br />In this case, the book was written by confirmed pop culture and Arsenal Football Club addict Nick Hornby (&quot;High Fidelity&quot;), so the viewer should be advised going in that &quot;About A Boy&quot; as a movie had a lot to live up to.<br />And it just isn't up to the task.  The book was as well-written and as involving as it could have been.  Characters were developed with sufficient depth and the very title of the book (A play of the Nirvana song &quot;About A Girl&quot;) plays into the plot and taps into the conscience of &quot;generation X&quot; by bringing early '90's icon/martyr Kurt Cobain into the story indirectly, yet importantly making him a central point-of-reference.  As a result, the book DOES find itself to be rather dated the further we get from Cobain's death...but that event, so central to the teen angst of the period, made the teen characters seem more legitimately troubled in a way that the movie, perhaps more timeless as a result of parting ways with the book re: the Cobain angle, simply cannot adequately grasp.<br />Hugh Grant is fantastic in the role of a flawed male lead character that Hornby specializes in writing about, and his interaction with the other characters is alternately well-played and extremely uncomfortable to watch; his performance does make this movie worth a watch, but you would get far more out of the experience by reading the book.  &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, this ain't.
B000007O9L|5.0|In the early 1990s virtually everybody from Eric Clapton to Nirvana released an Unplugged record. The Rolling Stones didn't. In several of the songs recorded for Stripped (1995), Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood play electric guitars. So all those who had some appetite for an unplugged Rolling Stones record were probably left a little unhappy. <BR>That said, Stripped is a really nice live record especially for their hard-core fans. Most of the live records that the Stones have released over time, from `Get yer ya-ya's out! (1970) onward (with the possible exception of Still Life, 1982), were centered around classic Rolling Stones hits such as Honky Tonk Women, Satisfaction, Sympathy for the Devil, Jumpin' Jack Flash and, more recently, Start me up. Stripped represents a step in a different direction as most of the songs recorded live for this album are the sometimes unjustly neglected Stones B-Side. The Stones recorded one song from their 1969 album. Interestingly what they played was Let it bleed instead of Gimme Shelter or You can't always get what you want. There are three songs from Sticky Fingers (1971), but two of the them (Dead Flowers and Love in Vain) are not neraly as well known as Brown Sugar. Two of the songs that appear on  Stripped were originally released in Exile on Main Street (1972). But even in this case, the Stones opted for Sweet Virginia and Shine a Light, instead of performing the superfamous Tumbling Dice or Happy.         <BR>But the overall quality of Stripped is great and record is nice treat not only for Stones fans. A final note is order, this is the second record with Darryl Jones on bass and it just shows how well he blended with the rest of the band not only in studio but also in live performances.
B0000TB05A|5.0|Finally, a great concert played with the live power of U2 to their crowd. Songs played are a bit different from the Boston concert, but a lot of feelings are shown by Bono, which makes the concert very special. Plus bonus material is quite good, a must for U2 fans. That's it..buy it..you wont regret it.
B0000TB05A|5.0|I flew from my home in nyc just to attend this once-in-a-life-time event, U2 returning to Slane Castle after 20 years. For this gig, they were not opening for another band, but it was their own show. And it was a big show. 80,000 people big to be exact. It was powerful and moving to be attending a U2 gig in their hometown with their &quot;tribe.&quot; It was a concert that got imprinted in my heart. So, I was in disbelief when I saw this DVD. I almost cried at the record store (no joke). After watching it again, the charisma, the enthusiasm, the love all come rushing back. Even if you didn't attend, you will most probably get chills down your spine. I've been to many U2 shows, but this one, certainly is one of the best. And of course, this show happend only 10 days before 9/11. The concert is still wonderful to watch, but  it also transposed me back to the blissful time right before the world changed drastically. In short, highly recommended.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|Reeves cannot act his way out of a Grocery Store-but we already knew that.  Not that he had much to work with here.  This is really a Japanese sci-fi anime' with some real humans thrown in.  Reeves style worked for the original Matrix, which was pure fun, new sci-fi, that had a strong team of chartacters working against an all encompassing AI.  Reloaded takes all the good ideas of the M1 and trashes them to oblivion.  MAtrix 2003 created a massive action flick with scores of soulless humans, from the egg of the original M1 combat team.  Sorry mess, but the W boys made a billion dollars, so they should be happy.  Awful stuff.
B00009TB5G|5.0|How do you top the best DVD release of 2002?  By giving Fans and equally great release for 2003.  I held off buying the Two Towers back in August as I wanted to wait for the Extended Edition and it was worth the wait.  The extended edition includes 43 minutes of new footage put back into the movie.  Some are merely extended scenes while many more are brand new, such as Theodreds funeral, and Orcs fleeing Isengard into Fangorn forest and getting a rude welcome, and Faramir warning Frodo about the dark route he plans to take to Mordor, a reference certainly to Shelob's lair.<br />These scenes add even greater depth to the story and fill in a few minor gaps.  The booklet that comes with the set denotes which scenes are new or extended...awesome planning by Jackson.<br />Beyond that you get so many extras that all other DVDs pale beside it:  Separate commentaries by director, cast, and crew, dozens of documentaries.  I haven't looked at them all, but they all run 30 - 45 minutes in length so there are hours of extras to view.  Among the best is the Making of Gollum, a 45 minute feature on one of the most interesting characters in the movie.  You get an interactive map and Atlas of middle earth, hundreds of design sketches, many with comments by the artists.  Features on the locations used for filming.  It goes on and on.<br />The movie itself is great.  While I'm a Tolkien fan, I don't consider myself a purist who gets upset over changes Jackson may have made to the books.  These things are a given when adapted to the big screen.  The Battle at helms deep is one of the best ever on film and I hear the battle in Return of the King will be even better.  I particularly liked the Ents and their destruction of Isengard.<br />This is the DVD versus which all others should be measured against.  This movie and the first, are reasons alone to buy a DVD player.
6305252572|3.0|Confortable formulaic action flick with some silly, laughable racist overtones, but Nolte/Murphy fans will enjoy the action and constant slapstick.  Nothing great but worth a few laughs.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|There have been many albums that have lost tracks from bands, the songs that were left off just feel empty and you thank God that they were left off the album. (Nirvana - Incesticide)<BR>and then we have our classic rock albums of b sides, singles, and rarities (beatles - Past masters 1 and 2, the who - odds and sods).<BR>I bought Pearl Jam's new Lost Dogs album the day it came out and what struck me was that while listening to the first disc I had never skipped a song, and I hate everyone who says that Pearl Jam died in the 90s and that grunge music is dead.  Pearl Jam isn't &quot;Grunge,&quot; they were never Grunge music to begin with, they were a power rock band, just like the who were in the 70s and Led Zeppelin were in the 60s, grunge is more punk/pop/metal influenced and Nirvana was grunge,as well as sonic youth(very underrated by the way).  The only other albums that made me this happy that i purchased this year were the Red Hot chili peppers reissue albums but those weren't even made this year, I wish bands like these got more recognition for their work!
B0000549B0|4.0|True insight comes from within-and it doesn't hurt to have an oversized friend giving you some guidance.  Just ask Elwood, an eccentric bon vivant who has just that- a seldom seen, but often heard ( through Stewart ), six-foot-plus Rabbit friend, named Harvey.<br />Some in town just don't get it, and others even want to lock Elwood and Harvey away, so that they are out of view.  Our two protagonists take it all in stride and teach those around them about the value of seeing the good in everybody instead of the bad.<br />Elwood is having too much fun to let life get in the way.  Timeless film about societal concern of keeping up one's image, over substance and true friendship.  One of James Stewart's best screen performances.
B00008I8IF|5.0|I love this disc.  I have everything they've ever recorded and this is my favourite.  The song &quot;Angelyne&quot;, I believe, is the best they've ever done.  When I hear it, which is often, it stays in my head all day.  Song composition, lyrics, and sound are great throughout the disc. Of course, as a big fan of the Jayhawks, I'd find it difficult to find fault, but I believe this one is more than worth a listen.
B0000DAOHN|5.0|What can I say?  Steph's at it again....this one is a winner.  Stephanie's been asked by a neighbor to find a missing mother and daughter.  But Stephanie has no idea what she's letting herself in for.  In addition to an especially nasty ex-husband, there are a number of other people searching for Evelyn and her daughter; most notably a killer rabbit and bear, and Evelyn's Napoleonesque landlord, who's into war games--and who has apparently declared war on Stephanie.<br />And in true Plum fashion, there are several car fires, dead bodies are everywhere, and the heat is turned up--to HIGH--between Steph and Ranger.  In addition, there is unresolved business between Steph and Joe Morelli.  Throw in sister Val who is no longer the  \\"perfect\\" sister, a small-time lawyer who's last name is Kloughn (like clown) and you've got a cast of characters guaranteed to keep you laughing out loud.
0684857219|3.0|I thought the new and revised version of the encyclopedia would have different training, diet and supplementation recommendations with up to date information on the science behind some of the newer techniques and ideas.  However, the only thing new in the revised edition is the inclusion of a new preface.<br />All in all, the book is pretty good for a beginner.  Arnold's training routines are pretty outrageous and not for the average person.  Some of the supplement recommendations I disagree with also.  I think you could easily find most of this information online for free, but it does have some good information on the history of bodybuilding, as well as lots of good pictures and descriptions of specific excercises.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you like upbeat dance music at all, BUY THIS ALBUM IMMEDIATELY! Britney manages to include banjo and surf guitar sounds and make them cutting edge. This is a tour-de-force from America's princess. There are bound to be five hit singles from this collection. The remix of &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; is even better than the original (both are included here). There have been three songs in history that have nearly brought me to tears: &quot;Moon River&quot; by Andy Williams, &quot;King of Trees&quot; by Cat Stevens, and &quot;Beautiful Boy&quot; by John Lennon. Now there is a fourth: &quot;Everytime&quot; is so heart-wrenching that I have trouble listening to it.  It is that beautiful.<BR>Don't cheat yourself. Get &quot;In The Zone&quot;.
B000001EL3|3.0|The best cover of any Kiss album. Great melodies, vocal arrangements and the band plays their instruments very well. Plus ya' got the smash hit \\"Beth\\".  A tad over-produced; and way too \\"slick\\" for the devoted Kiss fan.  Especially coming  on the heels on the sonic-blitzkrieg created on the \\"Alive!\\" album.     Ace was M.I.A. for several tracks here, so we get guitar solos from Dick Wagner of Alice Cooper & Lou Reed fame.  Of course the band didn't let it out of the bag for  several years that some of the guitar parts were not Ace.  Hence, I call this the begining of the end (lying to each other and the fans, backstabbing, boozing, etc..) It still bugs me to this day \\"Detroit Rock City\\" doesn't have a killer Ace solo.  Even though the band went on to mega-platinum success on subsequent albums, Kiss never wrote anything to match the material from the \\"original\\" first 3 albums.  This album is arguably the most accessable Kiss album for public consumption, but not for the diehard Kiss fan. Kiss \\"Alive!\\" stands as Kiss's definitive work.  \\"Ace Frehley lead guitar!\\"
B000063JDE|1.0|David Lynch, self-indulgence is thy name.  Regardless of the immense amount of praise for his work, he remains the most overrated director of all time.  Blue Velvet reveals the classic Lynch style, which essentially is a postmodern hodgepodge of the unreal and bizzare converging to a whole lot of nothing.  Bizzare imagery and absurdity aside, Lynch indulges in the absurd with no real message.  A single song is repeatedly sang/played as a &quot;commentary&quot; on the banality of modern romance / music.  It reveals nothing groundbreaking, nor does it do it in an entertaining manner.  Lynch has a large cult following, which is pivotal to the health of his career.  Yes, he rarely has aspired to the mainstream, but those within his following are deeply disturbed.  It is through the interpretation of Lynch fanboys that Lynch's &quot;throw it against the wall to see if it sticks&quot; style can possibly be seen as anything but fractured and ill-concieved.  Many of these interpretations (i.e., multi-layered structure) try to rationalize and enhance what essentially are hollow films, brimming with style and lacking of substance.  David Lynch has a wonderfully bizzare mind, but when that mind tries to paint the celluoid canvas of the cinema, it fails miserably to convey anything of value.  Blue Velvet leaves the viewer disoriented, and not in such a manner as to arouse deep thought or contemplation.  Its the type of disorientation that drives one to alcohol and/or narcoctics as an attempt to rid themselves of the horror of another Lynch film.
B00005JGAB|5.0|What else can I say but wow! This album still holds up after almost 30 years and (sad to say) what new group can kick a** like The Ramones once did? Answer: None! I also liked the bonus tracks (nice touch!). All in all, highly recommended!
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|I bought their first release and loved it and was really looking forward to this release. This is really a repeat of the first cd and there is no reason to go and buy this. You now have to question their talent here and their ability to improve as musicians.At 33 minutes forget it!
B00000AFDW|1.0|I listened to 3 songs on this CD and I said &quot;ENOUGH&quot;. I mean, how lame can KISS get? How about the fact that Peter and Ace hardly even play on the album and they still call it &quot;the origional KISS?&quot; Just whip out any Ramones CD (especially their 1st one) and watch these lameo's run for cover!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Here is a redux version (aka. &quot;naked&quot;) of a classic album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. For the first time ever, you will hear the music as it was intended to be heard from the original concept of the four beatles John, Paul, George &amp; Ringo. Too bad the album had been plagued by the over production of Phil Spector for 30+years. what he did was slow down the master tape a bit for more legatic sound, added chorus &amp; strings to some songs &amp; added some senseless dialogs as well as several discarded, unfinished, songs of John Lennon (Maggie Mae &amp; Dig It), to created the sense of &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the film &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Lennon, however, never approved those two unfinished songs. Instead, he intended his song &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; to be included in the final album, but it never happended, until now. The fact is, the four Beatles never satisfied with Phil Spector's job, especially they didn't like the massed string sound and the chorus as well as the whole re-concept of Phil Spector. &quot;That's not The Beatles' style&quot;, they said. They just wanted the album to sounds like four guys are playing music together in a small room, unplugged, with raw, unpretentious sound. That's their original concept.  <BR>Now, for the first time, you can hear this album in the correct tape speed with amazing clarity. Gone is the strings &amp; chorus as well as the haze &amp; muddiness of the original mix. The sound and the renewed vitality of the band in this new CD is amazing! If you really know The Beatles, you will know this album is the closest thing they wanted it to sound like originally. This is great and surely great item to buy for yourself or as a holiday gift.
0736696148|5.0|This unabridged edition of this intriguing book kept me looking for reasons to go driving.  I will also reread the book just to cross reference the history and art references.  For the too busy Americans, all of us, this is a great read (listen).
B00006CXXU|5.0|I have two of her CDs now this one included. Im here to tell you plain and simple I have never been disappointed.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|So Paul has re-released Let it Be with the silly commentary and mediocre bits of foolish busking removed.  Then I guess we can expect Abbey Road to be re-released without Her Majesty, and the White Album without Wild Honey Pie, can we?  Or does this revisionism only apply to John Lennon material?  Hey, Paul, if you re-released your solo albums with all the mediocre stuff removed then your entire catalogue after Band on the Run would consist of blank discs. By the way, LIBN is nothing really new.  Stripped down versions of the LIB songs are already out there on the Anthologies and Past Masters.  One final thing: &quot;Let it Be Naked&quot; is THE stupdiest title in the history of popular music.  I'm avoiding this like the plague.
B000065BPB|3.0|I bought the HD-280's two weeks ago. The sound quality is very good considering the spec'ed 5 dB variation (almost a 400% percent response variation across theaudio band). Also the headphones are quite comfortable and relatively light. I am rating these headphones at just 3 stars in protest of the blatantly false claim that the headphones provide \\"up to 32 dB\\" of ambient noise attenuation. I actually own pair of Peltor noise mufflers which are rated at 29 dB  and which do perform to spec. The HD-280 provides at best 10 dB of attenuation, no comparison at all. So if ambient sound suppression is important to you as well as decent sound fidelity, beware of Sennheiser's false claim. By the way, these phones are packaged in a heavy shrink wrapped container so you won't be able to test drive them first unless you go to a dealer that happens to have a pair on display.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney is pop.  She doesn't want to admit that she is the new Debbie Gibson, but she is.  Who cares - Debbie had a great career as a pop icon in her time, now its Britneys turn.  Though Debbie had more #1 and Top Ten Singles than Britney.<br />Britneys first albums \\"...Baby One More Time\\", \\"Oops, I Did It Again\\", \\"Britney\\" were average to low mediocre pop fodder.<br />Her latest \\"In the Zone\\" is finally a 3 Star effort when her others have been 1 or 2 stars at best.  \\"In the Zone\\" is no pop masterpiece, just good listening while driving on the freeway type of music.  Danceable fun.<br />Spears first single with Madonna \\"Me Against the Music\\" has been struggling on the Top 100 Billboard Charts, first peaking at No. 38 then falling into the 40s, finally rebounding this week with a bullet to No. 35.  Britney I feel her time has come and passed.  She only had one #1 single \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and only 3 Top Ten hits including \\"....Baby One More Time\\", - \\"Oops I Did It Again\\" which peaked at No.9 and \\"Crazy\\" which peaked at No.10.  You may make fun of Debbie Gibson but she had many more hits then Spears including 2 #1s, 4 Top Fives, and a total of 5 Top Ten hits.<br />Britneys album is very sustaining from beginning to end.  However I wish she would use her voice and stop singing like a weak kitten.  In her latest video with Madonna - you see that Madonna still has all the presence at 45, and Britney is just background wallpaper.<br />The album is good fun, but Ms. Spears my advice to you...you have all the money in the world, why don't you make a great album, really use that voice god gave you, stop focusing on other things and maybe one day we will see you on the podium accepting a grammy.<br />If not this could be Britneys last hurrah.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|Matrix Reloaded doesn't have a lot of plot, but I didn't watch it for a deep plot.  I watched it for bullet time, dance fighting and superhuman goings-on, and for people wearing sunglasses at night when it's raining because it's cool.  The Matrix series has style, and I like it.<BR>Apart from the movie itself, I enjoyed the extras, including the documentary on the highway scene.<BR>The big thing it was missing, I felt, was the sense of unreality and grand revelations that the first Matrix movie produced.  It's hard to top a scene where a character wakes up from a life long slumber to find he's in the midst of a vast field of hibernating humans.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I first discovered Rufus Wainwright from his song &quot;Hallelujah&quot; on the Shrek soundtrack. I finally got all of his albums, and I have been listening to Want One constantly for the past couple of weeks. It's one the rare albums that is amazing all the way through! His songs are all very different, but all really good. I highly recommend this album as well as his others, especially if you've liked any of his songs in the past that you've heard. Rufus rocks!!!!
B000127LW2|5.0|Voyager is the only Star Trek series from which I have not missed one single episode when it was aired.<BR>At last, now it is coming to DVD. I can't wait until February 24th. I'm really looking forward to seeing all the extra features.<BR>If you are a Trekkie, you must own it. I plan to order all 7 seasons as soon as they become available.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|This album is proof that Whitney is on a comeback trail.  I enjoyed &quot;Just Whitney&quot; while acknowledging that her voice has transitioned.  It's deeper and a bit raspy.  Her note-inflections are more provoked than natural.  But make no mistake, the girl can still sing her face off.  Buy this cd only if you are:<br />1) into holiday music<BR>2) a music lover who can understand vocal transition<br />Best cuts on this CD are &quot;O Come, O Come Emmanuel&quot;, &quot;One Wish&quot;, Deck the Halls/Silent Night&quot; &amp; her soulful take on an otherwise &quot;plain&quot; song (in my opinion) &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot;.  &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot; is sweet ...with Bobbi Kris.<br />Not so good cuts are &quot;Have Yourself A Marry Little Christmas&quot; and why she (or they at Arista) included cuts from &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot;, I don't know.  But for those of us who bought that particular CD, we feel short-changed.  <br />Overall, good product and a good stocking stuffer!!!!<br />Peace and Love to you throughou the year!!!!!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I picked this up about 3 days ago and I was pleasantly surprised as to how awesome this set is.The extended version is the only version worth seeing because it has alot of great extra scenes which were taken out of the original.Alot of really good extra features like commentaries and still galleries.I would recommend getting this one instead of the previous edition.I cant wait to see the return of the king.
B000002A46|5.0|I bought this cd two years ago and wow! I dont regret it. This cd really helps me to get in that special christmas mood. All the songs are great and sounds relly &quot;christmas&quot; if you know what I mean. Some Christmas albums out there is too R&amp;B or to much pop. This one is perfect. A holiday classic and Mariah at the same time. And really, It cant go wrong when the best singer in the world sings classic christmas songs. O Holy night blows me away every time. Merry Christmas!
038572179X|4.0|Reviewing ATONEMENT is tricky.  Whether you want to explain why it is wonderful or why you don't admire it, you can easily run afoul of the prime directive of speaking about a book to someone who has yet to read it: you aren't supposed to give away the surprises.  This book is rigged with surprises.<br />What can be said about the story: it begins in 1935, with one fateful weekend at an affluent country house in England where the younger generation runs from ages 9 to 25, and the matriarch is ineffectually absorbed in migraines and the father is absent.  The younger children, led by the precocious Briony, a budding 13-year-old playwright, are putting on a morality play for the young adults, about love and attraction and things they about which the playwright and actors really haven't a clue.  Meanwhile, the young adults are engaging in all those things.  The play gets called off, but Briony continues to impose her vision of reality of these things, and she ends up affecting adult lives dramatically.  The story then moves forward to the war years and finally to the present (1999).<br />This book earned orgasmic praise from America's most estimable literary critics.  What is good about it? The sentences are beautifully rendered.  The characters are drawn knowingly, honestly conceived.  Period detail is well done.  The description of a gifted young writer is very true, and it is not spoiling anything to say that one of the major themes better handled by McEwan is the nature of being a writer.  <br />But . . . . I have some negatives but that would require spoiling surprises.  I can say that because the sentences are so very fluid, the reader overruns the plodding action constantly.  That and while I thought most of the motivations and actions were quite credible, particularly in the 1935 section, the guiding emotion at the center of the book does not seem so real.  For the most part, this story belongs to BBC/Masterpiece Theater melodrama.
0688163173|5.0|This was my first time with a Dennis Lehane novel, and it won't be the last.  Shutter Island is a page turner from the protaganist's arrival on Shutter Island, site of an Alcatraz/ Maclean Hospital style fortress, to the hairy, twisted ending that follows some three hundred and thirty pages later.  Heroic federal marshals, nefarious psychiatric ward surgeons, and a host of colorful inmates at the asylum decorate this mystery that occurs on a small spit of land at the far end of Boston Harbor, and takes place over four days in 1954.  Bostonians will recognize references to the Cocoanut Grove fire, Deer Island pollution, and to nearby locales of Attleboro, Hull and Nantasket Beach.<br />Whereas 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' describes a similar era of mental institutions and delves much more deeply into comic/tragic experience of the inmates, Shutter Island is straight ahead detective work with a psychological twist.  The pages will rush by as you race ahead with the federal marshall and his partner while they hurry toward solving the mysterious secrets of Shutter Island.<br />I recommend this as a great weekend read...oops, they're coming to take me away!  They're coming to take me away.  Have to go.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I haven't heard this new version yet, but then again, opinions of songs are subjective anyway.  So it really doesn't matter.  What matters is fact, and the fact is this is a different version than the original, so I'll at least share with the uninformed of the apparent differences from the original.<br />First, it looks like the two short snippets of songs from the original, &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot;, have disappeared entirely.  It might have been nice to hear the full version of Dig It, if it exists.<br />Next, &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been added, which was the B-side of the &quot;Get Back&quot; single, but not included on the original album (which could've used it).  This track is also found on Past Masters Volume 2, as is a slightly different version of &quot;Let It Be&quot;.<br />A &quot;naked&quot; version of &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; already exists on the third volume of the Anthology discs.  So if you're just buying this for that, you may want to look at your collection already.  Aside from the track order being more or less reversed, there's not much more apparently different here.<br />I'm giving it a 3, neither good nor bad, since I haven't heard it yet, and it doesn't matter.
0312263120|4.0|This book is simply a thriller.  Does it have some character development issues, of course.  Does it stretch the plausibility of the reader when it comes to technology, you bet! Is it a blast to read?  Absolutely, no question.<br />In fact the last few chapters, with the clock winding down and the pressure on to solve a code with seconds to spare, I found myself literally skimming and turning pages as fast as I could to try and find out what happened and then going back for a more thorough read.  This is perhaps the highest praise for a tense thriller - the heart pounding, edge of your seat, emotional impact in the moment. It will make an incredible movie screen play, and would be a great thriller in the James Bond or Jack Ryan tradition.<br />Is this a literary masterpiece, and are the criticisms of other reviewers in regards the writing accurate?  Sure.  However, this misses the point.  This is just for fun, and in that regard succeeds brilliantly.  You will forget the details soon after, but enjoy the process.  If you get caught up in the details, then perhaps you are taking it too seriously.  Just sit back and enjoy the ride.  Highly recommended.
B00000295Y|5.0|In my opinion,this is their best album to date.The beats are really good and original,while the rapping fits in perfectly.Cypress hill are one of the few rap groups which I like because the majority of rap today is crap.I would recommend this cd to any fan of the group.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|With her fourth disc, Britney Spears shows that she's either evolving into a more mature and expressive artist, or listening better to what her management is telling her to do. Either way, &quot;In the Zone&quot; is a much-appreciated departure from her earlier discs in its deviation from the typical buggle gum pop of her earlier years. Gone is the innocent chick who sang &quot;Lucky,&quot; and in her place is a club-going pseudo-freak who only wants to be breathed on a lil bit. Standout tracks include the first single &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; as well as &quot;Breathe on Me,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; and &quot;(I've Got That) Boom Boom.&quot; This album shows a greater sophistication in production (Brit worked with a long list of them here) and a heightened naughtiness in lyrics. The main fault of this disc is the really poor quality of Britney's voice. No matter how it is morphed and electronically heightened it is still very apparent that this girl can't sing to save her life. But the hooks  are there and you'll be in a going-out mood before you know it. Not one of the all-time bests, but an adequate accomplishment for Britney.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I've never seen a more passionate, greater performance than the Who's singing \\"A Quick One\\".  I'd like to watch the full Rock and Roll Circus just to see if the crowd explodes.  Moon's sweat just pours off him and the drums by the end of the song, and Townshend is geeked up throughout.  Daltrey hits one brutal note, but who cares - he was still getting better, unlike the others, who were at their peak as performers.<br />One thing I'd like to mention is how good Daltrey's interview on disc 2 is.  He and Entwistle had very few lines in the movie, probably because Townshend and Moon were such strong forces, but now he's the last one standing, and his normalcy is now a plus. For one, he acknowledges what great harmonies they had (like the beginning of A Quick One), which is something rarely mentioned about the band because of Townshend's great songwriting and their strength in performance.  But the truly touching part is his talking about watching the release of TKAA with Moon and how depressed Moon got, seeing scenes of himself bloated and essentially wasted mixed with scenes of the young, great drummer that he was.  It's hard to believe that Moon was only 32 when he died.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Sigh. What's wrong with this movie? The first Matrix was an intellectual roller coaster, chock full of psychological and religeous references, chop-socky moves and a youthful exhilaration that blew the doors off anything that came before. This one is an exercise in &quot;get more ideas in play, never mind the framework.&quot;<br />The story, the puzles which made The Matrix so fun, is entirely missing here. You are plopped into the lives of the characters, they are as formed as they're going to get, and there's no growth. You don't feel any yearning from Neo to learn more about his role in the Matrix, Morpheus has nothing new to disclose, and Agent Smith has had his personality actually reduced.<br />The redeeming feature is the 15-minute &quot;freeway chase&quot; which is, for the action-lover, the best thing about the film. It's kinetic, highly charged, and fun. There's some humor in the action, too. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn't as involving.<br />You should see it to keep up with the story. But owning this part of the series...maybe not.
0375422307|5.0|I started the book thinking it's light reading... that, it was not.  I couldn't put the book down.  Marjane takes you with her on a journey through Islamic Revolution and the years that follow.<BR>I laughed, I cried and I relived.
0898159156|5.0|If you're ever in wine country (CA), visit his HUGE nursery.  It's obvious this guy knows his stuff.  The added bonus is that he knows how to write about it in an engaging manner.  The pictures are beautiful, too.  Read this books if you're at all interested in CPs or plants in general.  You'll want to raise some of your own (I did, and now I have three!).
B000002LIX|5.0|This album is one of a kind thanks to J.A.'s unique style. This album was revolutionary then and now, as Jane's took rock and made it their own. Fast, upbeat tracks such as STOP &amp; AINT NO RIGHT are balanced by mellow sensuous tracks such as CLASSIC GIRL and THREE DAYS.  I highly recommend cranking up THREE DAYS and letting the music take you... it is one of the best songs EVER.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Having read many reviews online, I figured it was time for me to put in my 2 cents worth. As someone who has been listening to the Beatles from the Ed Sullivan show on, it is always exciting when we get something new or improved. The sound quality on &quot;Let it Be Naked&quot; is amazing. I love being able to clearly hear instruments that were buried in Spector's 'Wall of Sound' technique. With so much disposable music being put out on a daily basis, it's great to hear the boys via modern technology. I don't believe this renders the &quot;Let it Be&quot; Cd to the the dustbin. I consider it a wonderful addition to my Beatles collection. It's an interesting experience to compare tracks from the 2 albums. I've even had my 25 year old daughter listen to some this way and get her opinion. She leans toward LIBN tracks in almost all cases. I can only hope this opens up the opportunity to hear more Beatles music brought up to par. The collection cries out for a complete up-to-date remastering. Buy the Cd, enjoy the tunes and get a couple of laughs from the &quot;fly on the Wall&quot; disc.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I won't talk about the movie, because others have said it in spades, - fabulous, gorgeous, brilliant -  but I wanted to say how insanely frustrating the packaging is.<br /><br />The DVD's pop RIGHT out, smooth as silk, but to get the statue of Gollum/Smeagol out you literally have to destroy the box. I don't think they actually expect collectors to actually want to remove it from the box for personal display. The FoTR bookends were NOT nearly this difficult to remove.<br /><br />Not only is it glued, the styrofoam protector of the base of the statue is cable tied to each other and the box. The background behind the statue seen though the window has to be removed. The box is a horrid mess to get the statue out.<br /><br />If you are a collector, and do not intend to tale out the statue for display, fine, the DVDs slide out just great, and you don't have to destroy anything to get at them.<br /><br />But if you are a fan and want to put the statue on a shelf and save the box for safekeeping, you'll be saving a mangled piece of crap by the time you get it out. (hint: you start from the bottom interlocking flaps on the box  you might have more luck than we did from the beginning)<br /><br />If there is a easier way to get the statue out, I wish they'd slip in some instructions for removal, I would have loved to have seen it and could have spared myself a cardboard cut cuticle.<br /><br />I dearly hope they don't do this to us on RoTK Collector's edition.<br /><br />-------<br />After I wrote this I found this link at the site of the folks who put it out, SideshowWeta -  (...)category=gollumdirections - it will tell you how to get your Gollum out!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Yes, at times Im embarrased to admit it but I am a Britney fan.  I have all 4 of her CD's and have watched her mature and shed more clothing through the years.  Her last CD Britney had her belting out I'm Not A Girl, Not yet a Woman.  Well if we had any doubts in our minds now, In the Zone has definatly vanished those doubts.  She is a women.  Singing about some very controversial subjects.  However this CD is very addictive.  She did a good job working with differnt producers.  Here's the rundown-<BR>1. Me Against the Music (8/10) Pretty techno beat, Madonna fits in nicely (I'm assuming everyone knows this song now!)<BR>2.(I Got That) Boom Boom (8/10)  It took me sometime to warm up this song.  I really dont like the Ying Yang twins in here.  They just ruin the song.  But after they've sung out in the beginning, the rest is really good.  Nice dance club music.<BR>3. Showdown (9/10) This song is really cool.  It has a really different vibe to it which I like.  Starts off kinda slow but speeds up. Yes the lyrics are kinda suggestive but the beat rocks! <BR>4. Breathe On Me (10/10) This is a gorgeous sensual song.  Very nice lyrics.  Def. one of the best tracks on here<BR>5. Early Mornin' (6/10) This is the track she worked on with Moby.  Im not a moby fan so this didnt really appeal to me.  The tune and lyrics were just kind of blah<BR>6. Toxic (10/10) Best upbeat tempo track on the album.  The chorus is soo \\"intoxicating\\"!  I love the tune.  It has a cool rock vibe to it.  I just wanna dance when i hear it!<BR>7. Outrageous (7/10) Very exotic Indian vibe.  Written by R. Kelly, so dont expect any tame lyrics!  The song does grow on you though.  Somewhat repetitive<BR>8. Touch Of My Hand (10/10) Best song on album hands down.  Beautiful oriental music background.  Yes, this song is very controversial.  The lyrics are beautifully written but VERY suggestive. The tune is magnificent though! LOVE IT!<BR>9. The Hook-Up (6/10) This sounds like a Sean Paul song.  Very exotic.  Reminds me of Beyonce's baby boy.  Not my favorite, the tune obviously doesnt sound very original<BR>10. Shadow (8/10) Slower track.  Nice lyrics, pretty good tune but the chorus is somewhat annoying<BR>11. Brave New Girl (9/10) Starts out with Britney doing a rap skit.  The chorus turns into a catchy tune reminding me of her Pepsi commercials and something that could be a soundtrack for the next Legally Blonde.  Cute song<BR>12. Everytime (9/10) Pretty ballad, obviously sounds like an apology to her ex.  I wish it sped up alittle, too slow in some spots but very good<BR>13. Me Against the Music Remix- (6/10)  It's kinda freaky lol! But ok i guess<BR>Yes buy it Brit fans! Its good.  Its not something I would buy when i was in 7th grade when Brit came out but Im in 12th now so i can handle all the sexual innuendos.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I liked her first cd, but in my opinion... it doesn't compare to this one~~~!!!!!!!!!<br />Try This is very Janis Joplin... Very Rock with just the right amount of R&amp;B/POP. Go PINK!<br />She outdid herself on this one!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I thought Whitney was through but she proved me wrong!! When you open up Webster dictionary under singing, her name is still there! I thought the album was wonderful and i hope she get her life on track because she still is the BEST!!!!!1
B0000D96NW|5.0|I will keep this plain and simple...Its their best...Its everything you would want from MH and more. Everything is better than before,...musically better,vocally,lyrically.. Although they was always good before...Now its somehow better.. I just wish there was more than 10 tracks.. Cause I want More!!!!!!.And they songs arent tryin to hit the 3 minute mark like all the...mainstream bands...they are long and worth listening to every sec...Amen
B00005JMF6|5.0|It's got a little somrthing for everyone; suspence, gore, psycological horror, along with a great story that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  I dug it.
B00005R6FC|5.0|\\"Killing Machine\\" was released in 1978, and it was the first time Judas Priest delivered the goods all the way from start to finish. The album holds a lot of strong songs and it fits in naturally time wise regarding the band's development from a more or less progressive rock band to metal gods. I would say that there are no weak spots to be found anywhere on this solid effort where the song writing seems to have been in focus. The furious \\"Hell bent for leather\\" might be the most known track here, but there are plenty of other highlights to explore. The ballad \\"Before the dawn\\" with its beautiful vocals and guitar play is really a gem, and there is no similarity at all to the ballads metal bands used to put on every album during the hair metal days. \\"Take on the world\\" is built like \\"United\\" from the \\"British Steel\\" album, and serves as a sing-along-with-the-band with its melodic and catchy chorus. Other great tracks are \\"Delivering the goods\\", \\"Evening star\\", \\"Burnin' up\\", \\"Killing machine\\" and \\"The green manalishi\\". I could go on and on, giving you examples of this album's greatness.  With such variation in the material, Judas Priest really capture the attention of the listener, and \\"Killing Machine\\" is an album you will never grow tired of. I consider this one almost equally great as the classic masterpiece \\"British Steel\\", and it's without doubt one of the finest efforts from Judas Priest. This album reminds of a time when the band had too much pride to put out any song that can be seen as a mediocre filler. My advise is: Get it, you won't be sorry!
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Two Towers Extended Edition is indeed a much better movie than the theatrical version. Everything you may have been scratching your head over at the theaters has been answered in this extremely well crafted version of the film. <br />-Wasn't Gollum just a little TOO helpful at the beginning?<BR>-Why didn't the orcs just kill Merry and Pippin?<BR>-Where did those other non-Uruk orcs come from?<BR>-Why is Saruman chopping and burning the forests of Fangorn?<BR>-How can Wormtongue just banish the King's nephew like that?<BR>-Why did Aragorn and co. give up on their search for Merry &amp; Pippin so quickly?<BR>-Why are there so few Ents?<BR>-Why does Aragorn seem almost super-human?<BR>-Where in the world did that horse that rescued Aragorn come from?<BR>-When did all those elves die at Helm's Deep?<BR>-Were all those Ents just waiting to spring out of Fangorn?<BR>-What's up with Faramir???<br />The relationship development of Frodo, Sam and Gollum is far improved. Merry, Pippin, and the Ents get their much deserved screen time. And Faramir (at least in my opinion) is completely redeemed as a character much like Galadriel was in the extended edition of the first movie. There are some really excellent sequences that simply have to be seen. The visual effects are surprisingly on par with the theatrical version. <br />Best of all - you get more time to revel in the world that is Middle Earth! <br />Must-see documentaries in the appendices: The creation of Gollum and adapting the book to screenplay. After watching these even the most die-hard Tolkien purists and/or Jackson haters will have to appreciate what a wonderful achievement in cinema this film truly is.
B000069AUI|5.0|There are not much words to describe how great this album is, I love this cd, after listing to \\"Clocks\\" I decided to buy it and it was definitely a great choice... The highlight for me was \\"Rush of blood to the head\\", which is my personal favorite, love the lyrics and the melody, but especially Martin's voice sound so sweet and soft, LOVE THAT SONG!!! Other that standout are; \\"Politik\\", \\"Scientist\\", \\"Clocks\\", loveeeeee \\"Green eyes\\", the only track that I could say was not as good as the others was \\"Daylight\\". Anyway this album is perfect and different from all the things that are out there in the music business. Coldplay knows how to impressed there fans, they have definitely done it with me.
B000099T2L|4.0|I think Beyonce was pretty good in this CD,but she could do better!!(don't you think!)

B0000DJZA5|1.0|It is obvious that there are a great many Beatles fanatics-with the emphasis on fanatic-out there, judging from all the five star ratings this release has received here. Some sense of balance is apparently necessary to stop this insanity. We all know that Paul was unhappy about the  Spectorized version of Let It Me, but in an interview before he died, John stated emphatically that Phil Spector took what he thought were \\"badly recorded\\" songs with \\"no feeling\\" and transformed them into an album that didn't cause him to \\"puke\\" when he heard it. Ringo, on the other hand, has lauded Paul on what is clearly a vanity project. Of course, Spector co-produced  some of Lennon's solo work (as he did Harrison), so John might have been a biased observer. So who is right? I suppose on initial listen these familiar songs sound pleasantly different-as atmosphere. They might even work as a historical document. But if one puts on the headphones and gets one-on-one with the music, only the fanatic can escape the truth of Lennon's judgement. This collection of songs does sound poorly recorded, distanced, thin and for the most part depressing. Considering the atmosphere surrounding the recording, this shouldn't be surprising; most of the songs here were never even meant to be album material, but merely a \\"rehearsal\\"  for a concert only Paul ever really wanted to do. It is clear that Spector performed miracles transforming this record into anything approaching studio quality; even the song that most people were curious about the changes to, The Long and Winding Road, bears this out. The version on the Naked release sounds incredibly depressing, belying the hopefulness of the lyrics; on Spector's version, the soaring orchestration brings out the hopefulness that was implied. And there are many other examples to demonstrate that Paul's idea of what this album should sound like were yet another Magical Mystery Tour film-like blunder. Many of the songs simply sound unfinished, and what in the world is that bizarre organ finale on Let It Be supposed to mean? If former Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau thought the Spector version sounded \\"ornate\\" what might he think of this laughable \\"augmentation\\"? I for one would have been more than happy if the Let It Be film was released on DVD, and this poorly-conceived effort ditched. It would have much easier to take seeing a band in the throes of disintegration, rather than be forced to listen to it.
B00006879E|5.0|Today all of the groups sound a lot alike, and this is not one of them. I saw them in concert in april and thought they were ok, nothing great though. That's until I bought their cd. I bought it about a week before they came back to st.louis, and fell in love with it. I agree it's more funky/jazzy rock more than anything. It is a great cd to chill out to, even to make out to. The whole cd can be listened to without stopping, and among my favorites are SUnday Morning, She will be loved, must get out, The Sun, Secret, and Sweetest GOodbye. Adam's voice just can capture you-it captures the emotion of the songs perfectly. Its a must buy.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|Nick's books are light fare that touch on heavy subjects, but they work well. Brought to the screen, this story just didn't translate well. The performances are top-notch, and there are plenty of amusing and touching moments. Somehow, though, what plays well in the mind as satire just wasn't remotely realistic when put in my face with Hugh Grant playing an unbelievably shallow and self-absorbed man prior to his eventual rescue. It's easier to suspend disbelief with a novel than a film, perhaps, but as a recent reviewer put it, this is the old cliche of the movie not being as good as the book. I'm glad I rented it, but can't imagine wanting to buy it and see it again and again.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I have even hesitated to watch season 3 because my husband and I didn't have HBO and rented season 1 just this summer.  We were hooked after the first 10 minutes!  I can't believe they haven't released season 2 yet, I need to catch up!!!!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|For those who are really into the band, the director's cut includes extra footage of them recording in the studio and candid shots of them interacting with each other. Many people have commented on how the extra footage is edited in odd places and breaks the flow. I feel the original concert film resolves that issue. You can watch them perform each track continuously one after another without any awkward breaks. The director's cut is just there to give some insight on the band and is just an effort by the director to create a different perspective.<br />I was amazed to see how well the original concert film was re-mastered. I couldn't believe that something filmed in the early 70s could be so crisp and sound so awesome. The band playing to an empty amphitheater sets the perfect mood and atmosphere for the concert. I have never felt so drawn into the music before. I liked how some of the songs were filmed at night. The dark setting adds to the eerie mood, as does the clips of the lava. <br />The DVD also has a nice feature where you can skip to whatever track you want to listen to. The photo gallery also had some interesting shots. I'm so glad it was finally released on DVD because I haven't been able to stop watching it.
B00008G8QV|3.0|I bought this DVD thinking that the instructor teaches the entire song.  Wrong!  While the instructor breaks down solos and riffs which makes it incredibly easy for people to play, only fractions of the song is explained. <br />I guess it's cool to be able to play signature riffs and solos, but I'd like to learn how to play the entire song.  Only being able to play like a minute out of 6 minute Metallica song isn't worth buying a $20 DVD.<br />And the fact that the instructor does a wonderful job of explaining makes it worse.  With his instructions, I could be playing any Metallica songs in no time (both James' and Kirk's parts)  But, that's not the case here.  It would've been the perfect way to learn hard Metallica songs.. but they stopped way way short of accomplishing that goal.
B000002H2H|5.0|Here my friends is the best album ever created. There is none higher. Don't even argue!!!!!! All you posers who say Puppets is the best must die!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Ok, enough with my fanatical rampage, but serriouslly this is the best album ever. Yes, better than Chilipepers - Californication. Yes, better than ACDC - Back in Black. Yes better than Nirvana - Nevermind. Yes, better than Sex Pistols -  Nevermind the Bullocks. Yes, better than The Black Album. Yes, it's better than any album EVER!<br />Why, well that's kinda hard to explain. I mean can you explain the feeling you get when your team wins the super bowl? Or the feeling you get when a child is born. Or even love, can you explain that? Well, this album is like that. From start to finish it's great. <br />First off, it has the best SONG EVER! On it's list. That's Right: FADE TO BLACK. If you do not think this is one of the best songs ever, YOU ARE WRONG! This song has everything, slow solos, fast solos, slow parts, fast parts, heavy parts, and even harmonies! Damn, if you can find a way to duplicate this song live, you rock! I mean, this is flat out the best guitar playing ever! The emotion displayed on this song made me want to cry the first time I heard it! <br />After \\"Kill 'em All\\". Kirk went and studied under Joe Satriani, and it shows! Unlike Kill 'em All, the solos in Lightning are structured and more techniuqe oriented. Plus all the songs sound tighter and more proffessional.<br />Allright, song by song review:<br />1 - Fight Fire With Fire<br />Great acoustic intro, shows the horsemen know their stuff. The Chord progression has palming so fast, it's litterally impossible to duplicate. I've tried, I have the tab book and it still blows my mind! The solo shows you that James can keep up with Kirk in the harmony department. And the lyrics show a political concisness not seen in their other albums.<br />2 - Ride the Lightning<BR>Kick ass opening and a \\"FAT\\" beat. \\"Da, dada, Da, dada, Da, dada, Da, dada\\" The solo's kinda easy at first, but then it roars into a classic Trash riff. Tottaly cool!<br />3 - For Whom the Bell Tolls<BR>A Classic Metallica staple. Based on the book by the same name. You can feel the despiration in Jame's voice. Allthough this track does suffer a bit from no solo, but hey, ya gotta rest sometime :).<br />4 - Fade to Black<BR>See earlier ie: BEST SONG EVER!<br />The drumming is eceptional on this track (allthough I believe Lar's best work is on the last track of \\"...And Justice\\"), and notes an obvious use of the doubble kicker, which most fans don't notice.  <br />5 - Trapped Under Ice<BR>Easily the best trash metal song ever, With three solos and no stopping to think, this song will kick your ass and make you beg for more!<br />6 - Escape<BR>This is the one track which does not seem to fit on the best album ever. It's kinda slow, kinda quiet, and the chorus is WAY off. The solo ain't that great either. The idea is cool though, sort of a \\"prison break\\" song.<br />7 - Creeping Death<BR>No word can describe the Biblical capabilities of Metallica. After the major sucsess of \\"The Four Horsemen\\" the boys flipped open to another passage of the holy scripture (allthough they claim it's from the movie \\"The Ten Commandments\\") to pull out another tottaly kick ass song. Job well done guys!<br />8 - The Call of Kutulu<BR>As if in stark contrast to \\"Creeping Death\\", Kutulu is raised to cloud any thoughts of Metallica being strict Christians. Based on the H.P. Lovecraft story \\"The Call of Cuthulu\\", this song does a great job of brining out the insanity of the story's main character, and giving it to the listener. The intro lick is one to be admired and played often, if one is into playing guitar. It is truly satisfying to complete. The solo echos the deffinig maddness, brought on by the great winged monster, Kutulu. And the absence of lyrics in the songs, gives it an inhuman quallity. The ending is a hard hitter, leaving you wanting more. <br />The fact that Cliff Burton was a huge fan of Lovecraft, had a hand in shaping later Metallica songs such as \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\". Living in the same town as Cliff for two years (Castro Valley, CA), and being taught by his music teacher, I felt an obligation to read Lovecraft. Once I did I became tottaly emersed. Check his books out, you'll never settle for cheap horror movies again.<br />Anyway, if you have this album, listen to it right now, if not buy it anf listen to it.<br />I repeat: THE BEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Having seen them on tour over the summer, and realizing they were on top of their game chops wise, I kinda knew they would be focusing on Balls and Chunk on this new record.  They certainly don't disappoint.  Overall, it sounds like they were listening to a lot of pre-Black Album Metallica and Opeth while making this record, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.   Although, it's always kinda tricky with James on vox.  <br />Every band member sounds like they've been practicing quite a bit lately.  They've upped the technical ante with this release, especially Petrucci and Portnoy.  Probably their finest DT performances, especially on This Dying Soul and In the Name of God.  Jordan Rudess and John Myung are also in fine form, although you have to listen a little harder to pick out just what Jordan's doing sometimes.  <br />My only problem with this disc is the rehashing of riffs from The Glass Prison in This Dying Soul.  DT has always made a habit of using repeated musical themes in their albums (Wait for Sleep and Learning to Live on Images and Words, The Mirror, Lie, and Space-Dye Vest on Awake), but tying into The Glass Prison was, to me, unnecessary.  I understand it was supposed to be a continuation of sorts from TGP, but don't make it so obvious.<br />The best thing about Dream Theater, for me, is that their music is diverse enough to appeal to many sides of my musical tastes.  They obviously focused on the heavier side this time around, and they pull it off quite well.  That doesn't mean that they'll completely abandon their softer side (although I'm glad there were no Another Day or Through Her Eyes type mushy ballads on this album).  Who knows what DT will do next?
B00000DCHD|4.0|By Spring of 1985, I was listening almost exclusively to Billy Joel, having been caught in one of those listening sprees which ruins an artist for a person for the rest of his or her life.  O.K., let's not get carried away - I still like Billy Joel, but rarely find myself listening to him these days.  I will say however, that in those early Billy Joel listening days, this &quot;52nd Street&quot; album was one of my favorite of his records...Nowadays, however, it has slipped a ranking or two and stands firmly as what I consider a &quot;good to very-good&quot; Billy Joel album, but not his best.<br />As for my favorite songs from this album, there's the cynical and rocking &quot;Big Shot&quot; which opens the album.  This was a big hit and deservedly so.  &quot;Honesty&quot; is a slow, pretty piece and laments the lack of, you guessed it, honesty - even from those close to you.  Perhaps the best song on the album, and also a hit when it came out (I know, because I remember hearing it on the radio pretty regularly when carpooling to Hebrew school and the like back in the late 1970s in Staten Island...) is &quot;My Life&quot; which is extremely catchy and is catapulted (in my mind) into classic status by the Beatlesque harmonies in the bridges of the song...&quot;Stiletto&quot; is also a great, atmospheric, song with a great groove to it - that coupled with the ultra-biting lyrics make this song one of Billy Joel's best songs ever.  &quot;Rosalinda's Eyes&quot; is a pretty song and it evokes the streets of NYC to this listener's ears.  <br />Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not quite reach the level of the above-mentioned songs.  &quot;Zanzibar&quot; is interesting for its jazzy feel with great trumpet solos...After much repeated listening, however, it grows a bit tedious - of course, that's purely subjective...&quot;Half A Mile Away&quot; is not a bad song, but it's not great either.  The one song I really don't like is &quot;Until The Night&quot; which is plodding and dull in my opinion.  Finally, the title track has a nice swing beat to it and sort of a cool groove, but it's nothing that great to write home about.<br />In sum, this is really a very good album with three great songs (&quot;Big Shot&quot;, &quot;My Life&quot;, &quot;Stiletto&quot;), some other pretty good songs, and the rest not-bad to not-great...Unfortunately, the neither here nor there songs comprise 30-40% of the album, so the album does not really reach classic status.  However, this album is still, unreservedly  RECOMMENDED!
B0000E1ALR|3.0|Taken as a whole, some of the greatest American rock music ever made appears on this CD, however, that alone doesn't make it must-have.<br />Long story short, the song selection again shows that Bruce simply doesn't &quot;get&quot; his own work (remember he had to basically be forced to include Dancing In The Dark on B.I.T.U.S.A.)<br />That &quot;The Rising&quot; is represented by the same volume of tracks as is Born In The USA, and that there are MORE Rising tracks than tracks from The River is the first major flaw.  The Rising is a marginal album...and there is no rational way to make the case that &quot;Mary's Place&quot; is essential at all! It is certainly less essential than many omitted tracks (My Hometown, 10th Avenue Freezeout, 57 Channels, Secret Garden, War, I'm On Fire).  As these compilations often do, this collection is weighted FAR too heavily towards recent, lesser material.<br />The bonus disc has its moments (Trapped and County Fair rule), but it is only 47 minutes long! Things like the original &quot;Nebraska&quot; version of Pink Cadillac (all the Nebraska remainders for that matter) or those oddball Arthur Baker remixes of &quot;Dancing In The Dark&quot; are exactly what &quot;bonus rarities&quot; discs are for.  Hell, they didn't even include &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town&quot; when this CD itself is nothing other than a Holidays Cash-IN! <br />I guess we can expect those when &quot;The Essential Greatest Hits Tracks Live&quot; comp. comes out in 3 years.
B0000DJZB9|4.0|This is a pretty good collection of the old videos. As mentioned, there's not any bonus material and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; isn't here, but if you're a fan it's cool to have GNR on DVD.
6302765536|4.0|Home Alone 2: Lost In New York is the sequal to Home Alone and is another great film.<br />  This time 10 year-old Kevin McCallister(Macaulay Culkin) does not get left at home, he manages to come with his family but the trouble starts at the airport. His family, including John Heard and Catherine O' Hara, who are played as his parents, are trying again to take a trip to France but Kevin boards the wrong plane and he gets sent to New York City. While at New York City, Kevin checks into the Plaza Hotel. Kevin thinks this is the greatest time of his life, but when he bumps into the same burglars who tried to break into his house from the previous Christmas, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern, his vacation turns out to be a nightmare. Now the two burglars are aftrer Kevin again and Kevin must escape from the burglars and get them caught just like he had before.<br />  The Home Alone 2 soundtrack is a great christmas CD and I would recommend it to everyone who loved the movie!Home Alone 2 was in my opinion not as good as the first but it is still one everybody should see!!!
B0000E1WNV|5.0|Oh man! What can I say... and from where should I start talking about this concert. The Boss's performance is unbelievable, the band's performance is excellent, and last but not least THE CROWED was phenomenon. I saw Bruce at Providence for the Rising tour and I have to agree that the crowed at Barcelona make the US audiences look very lazy, and boring!!!!!!!!!!<br />I think this concert is one of the best that I ever saw!! BUY it and you will remember me. I am giving it 6 stars!! THANK YOU BRUCE!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm 29 and this is actually my first Britney CD. I've always seen her videos on MTV, performances at award shows, but for some reason I just never bought any of her previous CDs. BUT I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ONE!!!<br />This is the best Britney that I've heard. She's definitely got the funk! She's always been a great performer, and I'm glad she finally has a CD that really showcases her talent. I'm very impressed. This is a strong CD. <br />I love all the other Pop/R&amp;B divas, but Britney's making a strong case with this CD that she's really the girl to beat.
6305537321|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's Holly Golightly is a timeless and wonderful character.  Hepburn's performance as the flighty and sometimes eccentric Manhattanite is delightful and engaging, which is why this film is one you can watch again and again all these years later.  The girls from Sex and the City could definitely get some pointers from the stylish and savvy Holly.<br />Seeing this film on DVD does not detract from the beauty of the New York scenery or the intricate expressions of Hepburn and George Peppard, who plays Holly's writer/kept man neighbor.  If anything, watching the two onscreen is a magical experience.  Hepburn's performance is larger than life.<br />Watching images of New York in the early 1960s always fascinates me and reminds me that times weren't as simple as we like to think they were.  However, Breakfast at Tiffany's embodies the style and elegance modern audiences still crave, and Holly Golightly never goes out of style.  Share this DVD with your friends one night--They'll thank you for it!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I've always been very anti-Britney--I hate the fact that she's so successful in the music business despite having a lousy voice and how she lip-synchs in her performances.  However, there have always been a few songs on each of her albums that I've liked but I still didn't respect her.  After listening to In The Zone, I have to admit that this is a good, fun album.  I think it's her best album yet.  No, Britney can't sing, but it's obvious by now that it's not about her voice.  In The Zone shows that she and her record company have a knack for choosing songs where her weak voice doesn't matter.  Britney's music is all about fun, it's not meant to be deep or meaningful.  The only songs I don't like are &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; because I think Madonna interrupts the flow of the song and &quot;I Got That Boom Boom&quot; because the Ying Yang Twins' rapping annoys me.  I like the &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; remix better than the original version, it's more up-tempo.  It would've been even better if they had taken Madonna's vocals out.  The other songs are great and diverse.  &quot;Everytime&quot; is the only Britney ballad that I've ever liked, it's such a pretty song.  Anyway, I just wanted to write this review to show that even though there are many things I don't like about Britney, I'm open-minded enough to admit that I can like her music if it's good.
6305364648|5.0|I could see this over and over and laugh my head off every time and I'm not even a big fan of either of the main actors. One of my all time favorites by far!!!
B0000TB050|5.0|It's great that everyone has an opinion. But some people should either get their facts straight and or develop a love for live performances.<br />This DVD was PETITIONED for release. THE TRUE FANS WANTED IT! They campaigned for it and successfully got it released. It's by no means a Christmas cashing-in. Of course the so-called fans would favor the Boston DVD, which is great...but suffers from an overly controlled environment, bland sterility at times, over glossed production and doctored audio and lighting. Is it a true live performance? No, not as it should be. What makes the Slane DVD a true live performance? Raw energy, emotion, sponteneity, musical diversity...and an electric crowd! <br />I applaud those fans for U2 for having this DVD released, even if it is a second offering from the same Tour. Every concert goer knows that each show is different, and true music lovers and true fans can appreciate that. <br />Pearl Jam released their official bootlegs series which is being lapped up by their fans...even if those shows are from the same tour! Each show offers something different, each one as important as the next. Peter Gabriel has done the same, releasing official bootlegs from his Growing Up Tour...and you know what...the fans are buying them, because is't about the music, it's about the passion and emotion, it's about the intangible sensation of experiencing a live performance.<br />For those of you who loved the Elevation Tour, search online for DVDs of U2's Southbend Indiana/Notre Dame performance and the August 8th Barcelona Spain perormance (which is Edge's Birthday and features &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot;!!!). <br />And the fellow from Oakland Ca, did you tell your son to throw out the ZooTV live from Sydney or Popmart in Mexico tapes for failing to include &quot;Bad?&quot; Sounds like a grown up hissy fit to me.
6302158095|4.0|I noticed that a lot of the reviews for Fantasia say it's for adults or older children.  I disagree.  I think it depends on the child.  We have this VHS tape and my 3 1/2 year old has almost worn it out from playing it so much.  He adores about 90% of the film (although the dinosaur part and the Dance of the Hours are his favorites) and does not seem particularly scared or bothered by \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\" which he will watch by himself.  He also loved to listen to the audiotape in the car.  At this point if any of the Fantasia or Fantasia 2000 music comes on the classical radio station we listen to he can recognize it and tell you which film and what part it's from.  I think that some small children will really like this movie and you need to give them a shot by exposing them to it rather than assuming they will be bored.
0385504209|5.0|Truly a magnificent read that draws the reader in immediately and makes a plethora of complex historical information readily understandable and interesting---Not only for the religious symbology, but for a multitude of architectural and art facts.  This is Dan Brown's greatest achievment with this book.<br />The prose is classic suspense, which, rather than dwelling on carefully crafted sentences and emotional vignettes, delivers the reader from one scene to the next.  This choice keeps the breathtaking pace of Langdon and Vernet's journey on track throughout every page.<br />Interesting is the fact that so many &quot;devout Christians&quot; seem to find this work so objectionable - their attitudes and words mirror so faithfully the paranoid men of the church characterized in the Da Vinci code itself.  Why not persue truth, or at least consider alternate versions of Christ's life, rather than cling to mythology?
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Although this is full of the Beatles' no. 1 hits, it's a bit scant. Personally I think there are a few on here which aren't half as good as others of theirs which only made the top ten charts, but these just happened to soar to no. 1 when nothing else that hot was out. I would purchase the other CDS with their full collections for the extra money at this point.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I've never really liked Radiohead, the singer's voice kind of annoys me, but this album blew me away. I still think they're pretentious but here they actually pull it off without it being embaressing, which is pretty rare in music. There are so many different forms of music going on in this album it can take a while to digest, my suggestion is finding a favorite and listening to the rest of the album every time you want to hear that. That's what got me to love it. Backdrifts is just cool.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|This cd is one of the best ever.  I actually saw Gavin Degraw live here in milwaukee and he is an amazing performer.  I suggest you listen to his music and if you get a chance, see him live with Maroon 5!

She has proven over and over she is a true super star before but now no one can disagree that she is the new Queen of country music
B0000024K1|5.0|This album could very well be the most important rap album of all time. Not only for its message of truth but for the fact that it is just incredible. Chuck D doesn't hold anything back and is pumping your ears and your mind full of knowledge. Flav is in top form here as is Terminator X who holds everything down. Buy this album if you believe that rap has no meaning and is talentless.   Please do not pay attention to the special 1 star reviewer. You really shouldn't take anything seriously from someone who said we should only listen to what the President is listening to and I.C.P. has better beats than the mighty P.E.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|It must be Christmas.  Paul McCartney is releasing yet another version of the Long and Winding Road and Let it Be.  I'm surprised he didn't try to put Yesterday on LIBN.  I do agree the songs are much better stripped of the Spector production.  That's what I thought when I heard them &quot;naked&quot; the first time on the Anthology's.
B00005JMFR|5.0|The matrix revolutions is a very good ending to a rather brilliant, ground breaking trilogy.Although it may not be satisfactory to everybody and not exactly what everybody expected i think it is a fantastic movie with excellent special effects and very good action sequences. Alot of people won't have actually seen the real ending to the film if they didn't sit through the end credits, because the actual ending, for those who don't want to know stop reading now, is neo waking up at his computer screen with the message \\"wake up neo\\" written on the screen, just like the beginning of the first movie. So either it was all a dream, or, the matrix is starting over, with smith gone, and the last exile now the creator, or thats what i think anyways, either way it is left open for a sequel, well they would be daft not to wouldn't they?, and i can't wait to see if there is one. All in all brilliant.

0743243153|5.0|...And I took the one less traveled by...<br />The essence of this book is summed up in the first three words. Life is difficult. Peck shows us that our avoidance of problems and their accompanying suffering are the root of mental illness. Difficulties are a fact of life, and they never go away. By refusing to acknowledge and overcome them, we create a barrier to our spiritual growth.<br />When I first read this book several years ago, I was not ready to hear its message. I had created my own reality, believing that I was working at my full capacity and was on the road to achieving my full potential.<br />While this book was not the source of revelation, it has been a catalyst to help me realize the self-deception that kept me from being a truly loving person. There is a long road ahead, but I am now on the path of lifelong learning and growth. The Road Less Traveled has helped me identify and remove many of the barriers that up until now had held me back from being the person God created me to be.<br />...And that has made all the difference.<br />Larry Hehn, author of Get the Prize: Nine Keys for a Life of Victory
B000006TRV|4.0|the wall is a great album. the movie is so insane. Comfortably numb is probably my favorite track... its still not really close to touching dark side of the moonl all parts to the funky slide guitar on young lust (the album's only upbeat happy effort and it rocks!) to the rhythm guitar on Run Like Hell this album flat out rocks. Buy it if your new to Floyd and the whole depressing aspect doesnt bother you. If it does bother you and your new to Floyd pick up Dark Side of the Moon or Wish you were Here which are definently on par with the Wall.<br />&quot;...all in all your just another brick in the wall...&quot; general gest of it isn't hard to find...  From my perspective, it is a fascinating venture (tho' rather obscure at times) into a narrative poem telling an epic story.  The main problem (yes, there are problems with this) is the fact that, although it is not as notoriously hard to follow, it is rather sketchy in places...<br />Musically?  Interesting usually.  Sometimes it is nothing save snippets of music to advance the rather sketchy plot. This is not an album you just play part of if you want a full understanding of the album (that is generally true of any decent album, but especially this one, and true concept albums. Sorry, Beatles fan, and I am one too, Sgt Pepper doesn't make concept like this one does).  Some interesting tunes would be Happy Days/Brick in the Wall Prt II, Don't Leave me Now, Mother, and Young Lust. (that's Disc I).  Disc II: (Is anybody out there)Track II (for the gorgeous acoustic track at the end), 6 (Comfortably Numb), 9. (Run Like Hell),10. (Waiting For The Worms), 12 (The Trial)..<br />Lyrically? Interesting Narrative Poem piece.  Because of the audience, it could have been made more clear, but that was Waters' call, and nothing we can do about it.<br />Another danger this album is that if people don't understand it, it is easy to take things out of context.  If you now it is a man losing his sanity behind a mental wall, then youunderstand the slamming of education and the racial slurs.  If you don't, then you mihgt think PF is against education and against the other races.  And interesting thing about &quot;Another Brick in the Wall Part II&quot;, is the fact that they're proving a point. &quot;We don't need no education,&quot; is a double negative.  They are showing that, despite the cynical view Pink has on his school, they do in fact need education.<br />Bottom Line: Good album that tells a story.  But be prepared to have to scratch your head a couple of times and question &quot;Now why is that song there and what does it mean?&quot;

B00008EY9G|3.0|THis movie although loosely reflected in the movie THE HOURS, i think is a bad attempt at a horror film.  The movie creates suspense up until the point where John Cusack appears in the court room as the murderer.  Once you find out that the whole thing is about fake people that this one guy makes up, all the suspense is lost.  It has a good ending, which is where it parallels to the ending of THE HOURS, is abrupt to the plot and yet acceptable to the audience.  The child shows the audience the nature of the killer, the fact that he would kill anyone even his own mother.  This also shows the relavance if his poem.  When first heard, you can tell that it is a childish poem and it acts as a kind of clue as to who the murderer is.  This was very thoughtful of the writers and intuitive the fact that audiences dont look for things like that and that they like it when everything makes seince in the end, which is what is accomplished in the van.  It is not the most desirable ending but effective none the less.  Over all it is not bad but could be edited for a more effective approach at horror.  If that is in gfact what they were hoping to accomplish.
0380002930|4.0|I first read this book in 4th grade, and of all the stories i read back then, i remebered this most clearly. I even remebered how i came to lose my copy of it, and how annoyed i felt. I figured there had to be a reason for this, so i went looking for this in my skool library (im in 9th grade now). I realsied that i didnt know the name of the author, so i went to try to find this other book by Douglas Adams. I was surprised to find, right under Adams, Watership Down, the book i had been hoping to find. It was like God had told me to read it. <br />Now that i have bored you with my random story, i will get on to my review:<br />I realsied after i read it again how great this book is. It is so meaningful and great, and deeper than a simple adventure story. It cxan be a little slow at times, and the discriptions can be a little lengthy, but i have found that even the long descriptions are fascinating, and i didnt skip over them like i usually do with stories. <br />I have read many reviews telling how this book is stupid because it is unrealistic, and how it is about talking rabbits. Or even how people loved this book because the rabbits seemed so human-like and told them about ourselves, and how they forgot the story was about rabbits at times. I loved this book because i believe opposite is true. The rabbit society is atonishingly realistic, especially in their reactions to humans and our society. The rabbits never acted in any way that you would not expect rabbits to act. Their language ability may have been above expected, but you can even sense their underlying naivety and ignorance. I loved how they could only count to four, and how everything above that they simply called \\"hriar\\" or \\"a thousand.\\" Their culture is very realistic and intriguing because it is so unlike our own. Their glorification of the theif and trickery i found to be an interesting contrast to our society, where \\"honesty is the best policy.\\" You really got a glimpse into not just another society,but a whole different species with a different outlook on life. Without this realism, the story would still have been great story, but empty of meaning or literary greatness.<br />I have never ben able to convince my friends to read this book, because it is about rabbits. I believe that everyone should read it, merely because it's about rabbits.

B00005JLD4|4.0|\\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" provides a thrilling adventure tale, a fascinating historical document, and a stirring tribute to the strength and resiliency of the human spirit - all for the price of a single admission ticket (or rental fee).<br />This true-life story is a classic case of racist imperialism run amuck.  As late as 1970, the white government in Australia believed it had solved the \\"problem\\" of what to do with all the half-caste children populating the country (a half-caste is the product of one parent who is white and the other aborigine).  The solution the leaders came up with was to simply take the children away from their parents, move the youngsters into government-run \\"schools,\\" then \\"ease\\" their way into the white population and culture.  The hope was that, through education and interbreeding, the aborigines would eventually be subsumed completely by the white race.  The most maddening and amazing aspect of this story is the fact that many of the people in charge of this policy genuinely believed that what they were doing was right, that they were actually enlightening the aborigines, improving their lot in life and rescuing them from a life of stone-aged hardship and ignorance - if only the natives could be made to see it for themselves!  It didn't seem to matter to these authorities that, in their efforts, they were violating the very foundation upon which civilized society is based: the sacred bond of the family.  Yet through the outrage of those characters who refuse to give into this notion, the film taps into that desire common to each and every one of us:  to be who we are and not what other people think we should be.<br />The story takes place in 1931 when three young girls are ripped away from their homes and families and placed into a \\"training camp\\" run by the government.  Molly is the oldest of the three, a sensitive but fiery girl of twelve who decides to break out of their prison and lead her cousin and little sister across 1500 miles of scorching desert back to their native home.  Young Everlyn Sampi gives a stunning performance as Molly, a wide-eyed youngster driven by strength and determination to rescue the three of them from this gross miscarriage of justice.  Tianna Sansbury and Laura Monaghan do an equally beautiful job as her erstwhile mates who face a task far more daunting than most of us will ever have to confront.  Kenneth Branagh, in a relatively small but pivotal role as the government official in charge of all the nation's half-castes, manages to bring a touch of humanity to a character who could easily have slipped over into unmitigated villainy in the wrong actor's hands.  In a strange way, Branagh makes us see this character less as an odious creature and more as a misguided product of his culture, upbringing and time.<br />Featuring expert direction by Philip Noyce and haunting music by Peter Gabriel, \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" serves the same kind of salutary purpose for the present day Australians that a movie like \\"One Potato, Two Potato\\" (also about the problems faced by mixed race children) did for Americans in the 1960's.  \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" provides Aussies with a chance to confront and repudiate a disreputable chapter in their recent past - something movies have proven very effective at doing in many different parts of the world.scorching desert back to their native home.

0312954468|3.0|Rating System:<br />1 star = abysmal; some books deserve to be forgotten<br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br />4 star = very good; what writing should be<br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: The rise and fall of Egypt and the forbidden love caught in the middle of the conflict. But more importantly how one man (slave) can change the face of a nation.<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br /><br />1) SETTING: There is always something magical about ancient Egypt and Smith crafts a story utilizing the full effect of this setting. Got to love it.<br /><br />2) CHARACTERS: Heroism and valor generate instant liking to a couple of the characters. Clever solutions to impossible tasks make us totally love the character of Taita.<br /><br />3) PLOT: This was really two shorter stories in one. The first is a novelette on how Tanus falls in love with Lady Lostris and with Taita's help they cleverly overcome many obstacles. Much of this story was telegraphed and not surprising. But Smith takes the story on a whole different direction as we go (very quickly) through the fall of Egypt to the Hyksos. This was full of unexpected twists and was a nice storyline.<br /><br />4) CONTENT: Unlike his sequel, The Seventh Scroll, this was a &#34;clean&#34; story. There wasn't a need for overt sex in this story and I think it paid off that the author chose to leave things to the imagination instead. Some gruesome violence but otherwise a PG-13 rated story.<br /><br />5) READER: The reader of the audio-book did a fine job of voices and acting. Some of the voices made me feel like I was watching the movie The Prince of Egypt. A fine job.<br /><br />OVERALL: I enjoyed this story and thought it was more than just &#34;good&#34;. It was a story that leaves something to be desired at first but then pulls it all together later on. I gave it a 3.5 rating because it was just a bit above good, but not great.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I am not easily given to superlatives but the Concert For George exceeded my expectations in every way (and they were pretty high).  <br />First of all, let me say that if you do purchase this DVD, do not skip ahead of the classical Indian music segment (as many were apt to do with \\"Concert For Bangla Desh.\\"  If this concert contained only this segment it would be a gift in itself, but fortunately there is the sublime tribute of George's music to follow.   Anoushka Shankar is brilliant as performer and conductor. The juxtaposition of sitar, vocal and ensemble music for the first segment (with George's Inner Light featuring Jeff Lynn doing the vocal) is truly captivating.  If you are not familiar or particularly fond of Indian music, indulge yourself, open your ears and you might really enjoy this performance.<br />Chris Menges camera work gives this concert film an aspect that is rare in the genre.  The feeling of intimacy -- you almost feel as if you are sitting in the Royal Albert Hall.  Not only are you on stage, but there are beautiful sweeping angles of the hall as well.  <br />The performances are inspired.  I was especially taken with how well Paul McCartney's voice blended with Eric Clapton.  And like a previous reviewer I was not aware of Joe Brown (I am now).  Gary Brooker gives a wonderful performance of \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" and some great piano work throughout.  Jeff Lynne seemed a little nervous during his Inner Light performance, (who wouldn't with all those master musicians behind him -- among them Vishna Mowan Bhatt, percussionist Emil Richards, and Ravi Shankar to name a few), but seemed to settle down and gave apt tribute to his departed friend, as did Tom Petty.  And we forgot (again), about Billy.  Billy Preston just has a way of engaging the audience as he demonstrated 30+ years ago in the Bangla Desh concert.  He does it again here.<br />If there is any disappointment at all, it is when musicians give tribute or cover George's songs they are only tapping a fraction of his output and only seem to focus on the \\"hits.\\"  It would have been nice to maybe hear such lesser known pieces \\"Be Here Now,\\" \\"Your Love Is Forever\\" or even \\"Far East Man.\\"  But this is a minor complaint.<br />And I was glad that Sir Paul made a comment at the end of the concert because it haunted me throughtout the film.  You are so drawn to the image of Dhani Harrison on the stage because he so looks like George circa 1965-66.  If you see photos from the Beatles \\"Help\\" photo shoot, Dhana's resemblence is eerie.  From the stooped manner when he strums the guitar, as well as some of his facial expressions, there is no doubt about his bloodline...<br />\\"Concert For George\\" is a fitting tribute to a man who gave much to the world.  I wish now that I had had an opportunity to see and hear it on the big screen.  If you can't think of a gift for someone who loves music, this should make your choices a little easier this holiday season...

156898443X|5.0|this is the kind of book that one reads in one setting, and then reads it again much slower. the story of danny, pattie, and jack coming to grips with the changes pattie's accident brings to all of their lives, is a parable for us all. danny weaves a story of life and love around a clever devise, his learning to draw. it is funny and sad but always intelligent. every person who has other people in their lives should read this book as a reminder of how good life is, if you stop and look at it for what it really is. i keep my copy nearby, and it makes me happy to just re-read a few pages now and then. i will be giving it this christmas to friends and family. i hope you will enjoy it as much as i do. the unexpected bonus is the brilliant art direction danny has brought to print.
B0000A36J5|5.0|There´s only one trouble with the special edition of THE TWO TOWERS, the same problem tha &quot;plagued&quot; the special edition of FELLOWSHIP: once you watch the extended version, the normal version becomes useless!:) YOu simply will not watch it again ever, because the extend edition is much, much better!<br />This one nears perfection. Everything gets tight, no loose ends, and prepares the viewer for the third part. Eowyn and Faramir are much more developed; for Tolkien purists, yes, there it is the trees killing the fleeing Uruk-hais. There is more interplay between Eowyn and Aragorn. There is also a little comic relief, there is Aragorn revealing his age and making it clear that he is a Dunedain. But the great new scene, im my opinion, was Theodred´s funeral when Eowyn begins to sing. It´s majestic! It´s a kind of a mixture between arcaic, celtic traditional songs, amazing, enchanting.<br />Also, in the extras, you may agree with them or not, but Jackson and Boyen did not hide from the &quot;hard&quot; questions, explaining their reasoning for changing Faramir´s character, for sending a platoon of elves led by Haldir to help at Helm´s Deep, for increasing the love affair between Arwen and Aragorn.<br />This DVD is rbeathtaking, the film was much more improved.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|To start with: I'm no Britney fan but I'm positive that Nirvana was a greater band than Pearl Jam. More sincere, more goundbreaking, better songs. But, that's just a point of view, which is directly related to taste. That's why I find really stupid and nonesensical the discussion down below...<BR>Besides that, here's what I think about  \\"Lost dogs\\": great, great album. It's a pitty  \\"State of love & truth\\" and \\"Breath\\" were not included but, on the other hand, I discovered a good amount of faboulous songs. I can't understand why   such songs as \\"All night\\", \\"Sad\\" (superb!!!!), \\"Down\\", \\"Hitchhiker\\", \\"Don't give me no lip\\", \\"Undone\\", \\"U\\",  \\"Education\\", \\"Fatal\\", \\"Strangest tribe\\", \\"Drifting\\" or \\"Dirty Frank\\" didn't make it in their albums, being by far better than songs that ultimately appeared on them. I liked the first disc best, which was the most rocking one; while the second runs in a more intimate mood. But with the best songs on both of them you could have a Pearl Jam album much better than \\"Yield\\", \\"Binaural\\" or \\"Riot Act\\".<BR>But what I like most about these recordings is their spirit, they sound fresh and honest, just as \\"Ten\\" did. I think that spirit was lost with the years, but it can be felt here clearly. They sound like a band, just a band, and not THE band. And that's great...
B000000WCA|5.0|Listen to this CD! This truly marked the return of POP! The Spice Girls burst onto the scene in America with the ultra popular song &quot;Wannabe&quot;. This CD went on to sell over 7 million copies in the United States alone, and over 23 million copies worldwide! This has to be one of my favorite CDs of all time. I remember listening to it while I was little (a.k.a. 10 years old), and it brings back good memories. The other excellent singles from this CD are &quot;Say You'll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Mama&quot;, and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;... This CD is excellent from beginning to end. It's too bad that the Spice Girls were so short lived! This is definitely a must-have for all fans of pop. It's really really really good. Give it a chance! Highly recommended, two thumbs up! ENJOY!!!!!!!!

There is a plethora of books on the subject of writing available, so King's take on the subject is valuable in that it sheds light on the inner workings of the writer, and challenges aspiring writers to read, with comments such as &quot;a writer reads--constantly.&quot; One myth he dispelled was the belief that he took his birthday and Christmas off. Not so, acording to the man himself. &quot;A writer writes, all the time.&quot;<br />Also, I found his description of being ran over and recovering from that revealing of his character. I'm no longer an avid fan of King's fiction, but found this book both personal and insightful, and worth the effort.
630027120X|4.0|Esta película es una de las más fuertes que he visto.  Me gustaba mucho y la recomendara.<br />La música que juega Gabriel (Irons) para cultivar relaciónes con los guaraní es un hilo a través de la película.  Es muy poderosa y transmite un sentimiento que crea un bono con el espectador.<br />Los temas que se tratan abarcan varios áreas--el político, los indígenas, la esclavitud, el cristianismo, la iglesia católica, el pecado y la penitencia, la lucha entre lo bueno y lo malo--cuando, como siempre por las edades, lo más importante es quién tiene el poder.  De estos, especialmente me gustaba la contradicción entre las enseñanzas de la iglesia católica en vista de las acciones de ella.
0385486804|5.0|As a practice architect with a Bachelor and a Master degree from an Ivy League school, I read, write, travel, and I thought I've accomplished a lot in life.  There're no challenges I'm fear to take on, until I read this book I realized how miniscule my life is comparing to McCandless's short one.  I found \\"Into the Wild\\" more inspiring than most self-help books I've read over the years.  My favorite quote from the book is \\"a challenge in which a successful outcome is assured isn't a challenge at all.\\"
B000001Y2U|4.0|Despite your personal tastes, interests, and/or religious beliefs, Antichrist Superstar is a great album. Not only great from the standpoint of musical content and production (Marilyn Manson should eternally kiss Trent Reznor's ass for making his career) but also great for all that it represented. EVERYONE's parents hated Marilyn Manson. It was a return to basics for rock and roll, and the angst-ridden goth kids of America thanked him in abundance for it. There is some very good material here, particularly the title track, Tourniquet, The Beautiful People, 1996, and the morosely elegant Man That You Fear. As mentioned before, the production is a key element in the album's potency. Nine Inch Nails auteur Trent Reznor manned the controls for this one, providing decayed and ambient atmospherics as groundwork for the riff-heavy industrial monolith that Manson provided. This proved to be the pinnacle of Manson's death rock perversions, and it remains a career-defining accomplishment
B00007BH5C|5.0|I loved the soundtrack for Fellowship of the Rings, and when the second movie came out, I was so impressed with Shore's continued work.  The first film was whimsical and light in places, reflecting the Shire and it's Neverneverland perfection.  It had to run to gauntlet of emotions from light and pure to powerful and pressing as they fellowship fought for their lives, to the sorrowful, the ethereal realm of the Elves to the final battle and redemption of Boromir.<br />Under Shore's hand, The Two Towers is darker, more intense.  It does not have the range of Fellowship simply because we are past the Shire and it's tranquil beauty.  But the score for the Two Towers is so moving.  Think back on the brilliantly filmed scenes, and imagine them without the moving score of this film and you begin to understand just how brilliant conceived this score is.  Howard Shore has firmly controlled the scores to make the sounds tracks as important as the film in creating the magic of the Rings.
B000127LW2|4.0|Less than one year following the concluding season of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" in 1994, executive producer/writer Rick Berman, along with Michael Piller and Jeri Taylor, created a fourth television series based upon the \\"Star Trek\\" universe created by Gene Roddenberry (1921-1991) in the 1960's. This fourth television series, entitled \\"Voyager\\" (which is the name of the Federation of Planets starship used in the series), first aired in January 1995, and ran for seven seasons until it concluded in May, 2001.  Because \\"Voyager\\" aired initially in the month of January (instead of the traditional September), only 16 episodes were filmed for the first season.  The succeeding six other seasons had 26 episodes each, for a grand total of 172 episodes for the entire series.<br />Unlike the previous three \\"Star Trek\\" television series, which (for the most part) took place within the bounds of the Federation of Planets (or in nearby sovereign areas of space, such as the Klingon Empire or the Romulan Empire) in the Alpha Quadrant, the starship Voyager is hurled tens of thousands of light-years from home into the previously unknown and unexplored Delta Quadrant, which is located at the far side of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Even while travelling at warp 8 (the fastest safe speed that a typical starship can travel), it would take Voyager several decades to return to Earth.  Hence, the series focuses on the survival of Voyager's Starfleet crew, who are completely isolated and unable to even maintain normal communications with Earth, as well as the crew's ultimate desire to find a way home faster than their ship is capable of doing.  Also, along the way, Voyager adopts a few Delta Quadrant natives.<br />The primary cast members of the first season of \\"Voyager\\" include Captain Catherine Janeway (Kate Mulgrew), Commander Chakotay (Robert Beltran), the half-Klingon Lt. B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson), Delta Quadrant native (Ocampan) Kes (Jennifer Lien), Lt. Thomas Eugene Paris (Robert Duncan McNeill), Delta Quadrant native (Talaxian) Neelix (Ethan Phillips), the holographic Emergency Medical Holographic Program (a.k.a., \\"The Doctor\\", played by Robert Picardo), the Vulcan Lt. Cmdr. Tuvok (Tim Russ) and Ensign Harry Kim (Garrett Wang).  In the two-part series opener entitled \\"The Caretaker\\", Chakotay, B'Elanna, Seska (Martha Packett) and a few other occasional Voyager crewmen were not part of the original Voyager crew.  Instead, they were members of the Maquis, a group of armed separatists opposed to both Federation and Cardassian rule.  They, along with the crew of Voyager (who is sent to capture them), are themselves captured by a very advanced being known only as the Caretaker, who uses his technology to grab and transport them to the Delta Quadrant.  The transportation damages Voyager and the Maquis ship and leaves many Voyager crewmen dead.  Rather than let a less advanced, but violent, race known as the Kazon obtain the ailing Caretaker's technology, Captain Janeway makes the unpopular decision to destroy the Caretaker's ship, which also destroys their best & easiest chance of getting home quickly.  Hence, Voyager is on its own in the Delta Quadrant, having no support from the Federation, and begins its long journey back home with a combined Federation/Maquis/Delta Quadrant-native crew.<br />Through the first season, Voyager continues to battle the Kazon (who are determined to own its technology), the unfriendly holographic Doctor (the only doctor on board) starts to become more sentient and friendly thanks to his interactions with Kes, a traitor is on the loose, the phage-infected Vidians want to harvest Voyager crewman organs, the crew experiences time travel, the crew have to acquire a taste for Neelix's cooking, and B'Elanna experiences inner battle between her human and Klingon halves.  Noteworthy episodes include the two-part \\"The Caretaker\\", \\"Time and Again\\", \\"Phage\\", \\"The Cloud\\", \\"Eye of the Needle\\", \\"Emanations\\", \\"Faces\\", \\"Jetrel\\" and \\"Learning Curve\\".<br />Overall, I rate the first season of \\"Voyager\\" with 4 out of 5 stars.  It was a good start for what ultimately became a much better series after the introduction of the former Borg character \\"Seven of Nine\\" (Jeri Ryan) at the end of the third season.  I am very glad to see Paramount Television finally begin releasing the \\"Voyager\\" series on DVD.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|Frankly, I'm glad Bruce has released this set whether it's for making money or not.  I, like many of you, already own the material on Discs 1&amp;2.  Disc 3 is where it's at and at $18.95 here at Amazon who cares if Bruce is doing it for the money.  You could go down to your local Record Town or FYE and get raped for $18.99 on a single CD.  Personally, I will listen to Discs 1&amp;2 as well.  It saves me from packing every Bruce disc I own when I go on trips.  Sure, I have gripes about the track listing like all diehards but this set is worth it.  Bruce can charge $75 for a show or put out money-making compilations all he wants as long the show still rocks and there's a bonus disc of rarities and never releaseds.  Why be upset with Bruce for getting rich on this?  CEO's of this country make more than Bruce and what do we get from them?  Jack, that's what.  Bruce deserves my money for all the pleasure his music has brought me.  Buy this, enjoy it and pray for Tracks boxset Volume 2.
B00009TB5G|5.0|In 2002, one year following the release of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Peter Jackson directed the next film in the series based upon J.R.R. Tolkien's trilogy:  &quot;The Lord of the Ring: The Two Towers&quot;.  As with the first, the cinematography and special effects used in the second are fantastic and even surpass the first as demonstrated by the computer-generated characters of Gollum (a.k.a., Sméagol, with the voice done by Andy Serkis) and Treebeard (voice done by John Rhys-Davies, who also plays Gimli son of Gloin in the film).  Peter Jackson's direction of the film was equally brilliant in the second film and the performances by the many actors were realistic and engaging.  As was the case when I first saw the extended DVD version of the first film, seeing the extended DVD version of the second film made the second film come to life far more than I had previously seen in its shorter theatrical release.<br />The continuation of the story in the second film is darker than the story's beginning in the first film.  Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and his companion Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee (Sean Astin) continue their journey to the land of Mordor.  Climbing over seemingly endless rocks and cliffs, they realize that they have become lost, but also that they are not alone.  Following them is the creature known as Gollum, who had once been named Sméagol.  Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, who agrees to show them the way to the Black Gate of Mordor.  The other two hobbits who left the Shire, Peregrin 'Pippin' Took (Billy Boyd) and Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck (Dominic Monaghan), are the captives of a brutal band of orcs lead by one named Uglúk (Nathaniel Lees).  He was previously given strict orders from Saruman (Christopher Lee) to bring back the Hobbits unharmed. Having let Frodo and Sam leave on their own, Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Legolas Greenleaf (Orlando Bloom) and Gimli son of Gloin (John Rhys-Davies) have vowed to rescue Pippin andMerry and pursue the orcs, who have entered the land of Rohan.  Rohan is lead by King Théoden (Bernard Hill), but all is not well with him and he is under the guidance of a strange advisor, Grima Wormtongue (Brad Dourif), who does not appear to have Rohan's best interests at heart.  Grima has his eye on the King's niece, Éowyn (Miranda Otto), who wants nothing to do with him; but he doesn't like her brother, Éomer (Karl Urban).  A changed Gandalf (Ian McKellan) returns to join the fight against Sauron, and Frodo and Sam get to meet Faramir (David Wenham), who was the brother of Boromir (played by Sean Bean in the previous film and in the extended version this film only).  Also returning to the second film are the characters Arwen (Liv Tyler), Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett), but with lesser roles than in the first.<br />Memorable scenes in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; include Pippin &amp; Merry's escape from the orcs, Pippin &amp; Merry's meeting of Treebeard, Frodo and Sam capturing Gollum, the return of the changed Gandalf, Gandalf's first meeting with King Théoden, the battle with the riding orcs, the swamp, the arrival of the elves lead by Haldir (Craig Parker), the battle at Helm's Deep and battle of the trees.  The extended DVD version better ties the various scenes in the film together and provides a deeper understanding of several of the characters, especially Faramir and the trees.<br />Overall, I rate both the regular and extended versions of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars.  It is no wonder that the film won two Oscars for Best Sound Editing and Best Special Effects and was nominated for four more: Best Art Direction, Best Editing, Best Sound and Best Picture.  I highly recommend purchase of the extended version DVD, which breaks the film between two DVD's and includes two extra DVD's that include multiple documentaries, design &amp; photo galleries, an atlas of Middle Earth, etc.  I also can't wait to see the third and final film installment, &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, and to purchase it on extended version DVD.
0553573403|1.0|There are several passages in Martin's series that are so graphic, they could not be published on this web site. What does that tell you? If you want to consume filth, save your money and watch some more television.
B000000OAL|3.0|Queen's first album is certainly not my favorite.  In fact, I'm pretty indifferent to most of it (which is why I will give it three stars instead of two... two because I liked four of the ten songs, not counting bonus tracks, 2/5ths of the album, but didn't actually dislike the remaining songs... they just didn't do anything for me.  Therefore, three out of five for the rating).  As my review for \\"Queen II\\" will tell you, getting into both of Queen's first two albums was something of a chore for me, work which began for both of them at about the same time.  Unfortunately, while \\"Queen II\\" is after not quite two years of on-and-off listening starting to pay off and is quickly becoming a favorite (but not THE favorite Queen album... that title will likely forever be held by their final opus, \\"Innuendo\\"), the original \\"Queen\\" hasn't moved much.  <br />Of the ten actual original tracks on the album (forgetting about bonus tracks for the moment), I only enjoyed four of them: the first, a favorite from before I even heard this album, \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\"; the second \\"Doing Allright\\" (LOVE the fast guitar work, courtesy of Brian, together with Roger's drumming as the tempo rises on two occasions); track six, \\"The Night Comes Down\\"; which segues into track seven, Roger's \\"Modern Times Rock and Roll\\".  All four great songs, until the last two seconds of \\"Modern Times\\"... I just don't like the way they finished the song.  It doesn't really improve from there, for me at least...<br />The bonus tracks don't do much for me either... just \\"Mad the Swine\\", a take-it-or-leave it song, a couple of remixes, and another version of \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", which features an (unfortunately) shorter drum solo and some different harmonies on the chorus... otherwise it's about the same as the regular version.<br />Even though \\"Queen\\" is the debut of one of my favorite bands, it's also, of their albums that I've heard, also my least favorite.  Which is to say that they improved, quite drastically in fact, starting with their second album, so that's good news at least.  If you're just starting to get into them and want to collect all their albums eventually, I wouldn't hold this one high on my list unless you find a nice, inexpensive copy.<br />Enjoy what you can of it, but try not to be too disappointed (unless you're one of those fortunate souls who was able to like it right from the start.  If so, more power to you!).<br />Carry on carry on,<br />MN
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Like most, I was excited for this second installment.  But it proved to be ultimately disappointing, coming nowhere close to meeting my expectations.<br />&quot;The Matrix&quot; is a well-rounded film with high-quality visuals, good entertainment value, interesting and intellectual themes and tones, and all-round very re-watchable.<br />&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;, however, suffers from a lack of what made the first film great; the action and visuals are almost over-done, themes are deglected, the script is weak, and the plot seems a bit thin.  In recognizing that this is the middle installment, there is room for a lack of substance in the plot, though, seeing as this film is meant to tie the other two together.<br />In terms of the visuals and action sequences being over-done, certain scenes were too long and drawn-out and over-the-top.  It felt as though they were there more as a means to show-off than to enrich the film.  (Whereas in the first film the action didn't detract from the overall goal of the film.  The sequences were also more thoughtful and more discreet -- it wasn't a matter of how &quot;cool&quot; a fight was, but how artful it appeared.)<br />There was definitely some unnecessary fluff in Revolutions, which does have its place, but only when it's not drawn-out and isn't simply bad.  (There's one scence/sequence I'm thinking of here, which is probably fairly obvious.  I though it could have been much more crisp and, well, shorter.)<br />This second installment did do a fairly good job of opening up new plot and theme elements -- creating some of the intellectual curiosity so prevalent in the first film. And while I think the film ended in the right direction, certain plot elements seemed to be going wayward.  Though I ultimately feel that the abruptness of the main revelations towards the end of the film were abrupt and overly-terse.  (And either refuted or left unexplained/unexplored in the final film.)<br />Revolutions submitted to the mold ofan action film and didn't follow the more well-rounded original, leaving it absent of the necessary elements to create a cohesive trilogy.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I have had this CD for 3 months now and it is still a constant in my CD changer.  Erykah is a musical genius that only speaks to those who truly love the art of being original and unique in music.  &quot;Bump It&quot; and &quot;Back In the Day&quot; took me back to the early 80's without sampling or sounding like any 80's R&amp;B jam I have heard before.  &quot;I Want You&quot; is so genius. The center of it is so emotional and raw.  You truly feel her passion in &quot;I Want You&quot;. If I estimate Erykah right, all the repeats were probably put there to thwart MP3 sharers. Anyway, Erykah even dares to sample from  Pink Floyd's &quot;Big Gig in the Sky&quot; (check it out)at the end of her &quot;Danger&quot;. This lets me know she is in tune to all types of music and not just pigeon holed into one genre. The whole cd is non-stop and each song effortlessly merges into the next,leaves you spellbound and wanting to repeat each last song.  I cannot cover how excellent this album is with just 1000 words so get it for yourself and be reminded of what real music and artistry is all about.
B000002VTE|5.0|Written at a time of romantic breakup that was not dulled by J. Spaceman's substance abuse, this release contains some of Spiritualized's finest moments.<br />Tracks like COME TOGETHER, I THINK I'M IN LOVE, ELECTRICITY, COOL WAVES and the 17 minute opus COP SHOOT COP are all hallmarks of this bands (J. Spaceman aka Jason Pierce) canon.  There may be a few tracks that float off too far into the ether, but overall this is a true sonic masterpeice.<br />As good as this is, and I would heartily recommend it, I would probably tip my hat to LASER GUIDED MELODIES as this bands best release.  Together they are two of the most musically adventurous albums released in the 90's.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|To say this movie was great does not do the film justice. Much better than the slow first movie, X-2 is a fast-paced action flick punctuated with wonderful special effects. The powers of each mutant are totally believable. The audience is dazzeled with Nightcrawler's teleportation powers, electified by Storm's awesome weather abilities (Halle Berry rocks as Storm, but I would have liked a Jamacain/African accent), and captivated by Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike's dual of claws! This movie has an all-star cast including the genius of Sir Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart, the strength of Hugh Jackman and the budding talent of Shaun Ashmore (Iceman). Plot/storyline is also very strong in this movie. The tale is captivating and leaves the audience wondering who will use their powers to get out of the current ominous situation. In its entirety, this movie is great fun to watch. The mutant mayheim running rampant throughout this movie makes the audience thirsty for a sequel and makes this a great must-own DVD.
B0000067X1|5.0|This release by Can, as well as some of their other works can act like a Rosetta Stone for modern music.  Once you hear and appreciate what he band is doing, suddenly many other groups that approach Avant Garde rock make sense.<br />30 years after it's release, TAGO MAGO remains as powerfull and innovative as the day it was released.  How many other albums of that time period can you say that about?
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The funny thing that happens to Britney's CD review is that, it's not the songs that are being talked about but the fact that this &quot;artist&quot; cannot sing. Don't blame people for pointing out the fact. Blame Britney for wasting plastics producing these songs that most people can sing better than she does. I was thinking, to be like Britney, besides stripping our clothes, we probably just need background music to help us sing. Another sad thing is the immature lyrics she wrote, what does &quot;my weakness causes you pain&quot; mean?? It's really trash. <br />I think Britney's music is not a real music, we should invent a word for her so-called 'music.' And also, it's not fair that she lip-sync all the time on TV now!! Cheater!
B000055Y0X|5.0|As timely as ever as once again we see the Doomsday Clock approaching midnight with all the false bravado of the White House when it comes to its war on terrorism.  Kubrick nailed the Cold War.  The characterizations are spot on.  Peter Sellers has a field day in his multiple roles, with Dr. Strangelove a fantastic parody on the German scientists who came to America to develop the bomb.  General Turgidson made me think of Rumsfeld.  Quick to come up with a snappy reply to any of the questions posed in the War Room as the crisis deepens.  But, the star of the show is Slim Pickens as Major TJ 'King' Kong as he leads the B52 deep into Russian territory determined to find his target.  As Kubrick noted, the scenario was so absurd that humor was the only treatment possible, steering a different course than the novel he loosely based the movie on, Red Alert.
B000089RVR|5.0|Are you looking for a cd full of dance tunes, heart thumping bass, and vocals that sound like every Christina-Britney wannabe?  Well, this cd isn't for you then -- Go buy a JLo or Creed cd and stop reading here.<br />BUT if you are looking for music to relax to, sing to, work to, make love to, this is the cd you need.  On the first listen, I was intrigued by the sound.  On the second and third listen, I fell in love with the lyrics.  Now I have a new favorite song on the cd.<br />Granted Dido is not everybody's style, but if you like Sarah McLachlan and Jewel (think Pieces of You era), then give it a try.
B0000A36J5|4.0|While the DVD itself was glorious, I had to destroy the box in order to get Gollum out. The styrofoam holder was glued to the bottom of the box and a cable tie surrounded the styrofoam. <br />Whoever designed the packaging obviously had not intended to let Gollum out of the box. Pity.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the greatest Shania DVD so far! I already have all the others..I bought this one because I went to see Shania live in concert and wanted to see what she had done for her Special from Chicago: I was blown away! The pure energy you experience by watching the DVD is without limits! It's like being there with all those thousands of fans in Chicago: Shania is fantastic! The songs, the voice .....the fireworks! Get this DVD and throw a party!
B00006879E|5.0|I'm always a bit unsure whether I should buy a CD from a new act after only hearing one song. That was the case with Maroon 5. 'Harder To Breathe' was a full out awesome song, and I thought 'What if the rest of the album doesn't fit the bill?'<br />I need not worry about a thing. Maroon 5 are a solid, fun group who in my opinion are more skilled than most of today's other 'groups'.<br />There are some great tracks on here 'Shiver', 'The Sun', 'Sunday Morning' and 'Secret' There is one sower note on here though, the song 'Through With You'. Sounds a bit to boyband for my liking. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It just seems out of place here on this collection of calm, wonderfully meldoic songs.<br />All in all, Maroon 5 was well worth the purchase and worth my time.<br />Five out of Five.
B00005LOUP|1.0|This movie is horrible!  What were they thinking when they took a classic and turned it into a trash.  I would not be surprised if Dr. Seuss would be rolling over in his grave from this movie.  How could they take the integrity of the original story and add sexual references.  Its gross and makes my stomach turn.  Children should not watch this version of the beloved story line of The Grinch who Stole Christmas.  The costumes are the only good and creative element of the whole movie.   Otherwise, this movie is horrible!  Please spend your money on something that is worth while, like the original.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I got this CD over a year ago, the day it came out, and a year later it's even better than the day I got it. Five singles in now 'Dirrty', 'Beautiful', 'Fighter', 'Can't Hold Us Down' and 'The Voice Within' have proven that this girl is gonna be a force for the next ten years, easy.<br />I was actualy very suprised how introspective this album was and still is. Her voice matured, she began writing her own songs, and she developed as the full package entertainer. How can you not give this album Five out of Five.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|A great job of direction, and great acting all around. New and old actors in this one. One of the only movies that Pacino doen't over-act. His best aside from the Godfather films. Scarface has some classic scenes; the chainsaw, helicopter death, night club shootout, and don't forget the finale! Also one of the first times cocaine was refered to as yayo. Plus great music that fits the movie, and the suits are awesome. Great film overall; anyone interested in mob movies, or if you just like lots of action that goes with a good story will like this movie. And you don't have to know a word of Spanish, though you may want to turn the closed caption on for the long diolague scenes from pacino. If you don't want to pitch in the 20 odd bucks for the DVD, the VHS is just as good; besides the DVD only has a few extra features that really don't say much more about the movie. Buy or rent and enjoy!
0385504209|5.0|The Da Vinci Code is the best book I've read in a while. It evolves from a simple murder myster to a race for the Holy Grail. Dan Brown does an excellent job of implementing art and history theories into the plot. This book is much more complex and thought-provoking than most of today's popular books. I highly recommend this book to everyone.<br />Oh, one more thing. I'm a Catholic, and I had no problem with this book. I find it amusing that there are so many Catholics on this site that are horribly offended by this book. Lighten up, people. It's not like Dan Brown assassinated the pope.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The stand out element about this album is the music! The beats are great and will get you moving. This should only be listened to be club/techno lovers. Otherwise, you'd have a major headache from all the pulsing. Britney doesn't sing much on this album (maybe that's the reason its good *shrugs*), but somehow, she's perfect for it. She's very Kylie Minogue on this CD. Her voice isn't too vocally strong to interrupt the flow of the beat, but seductive enough to keep you singing the lyrics. Here's a run down of the songs:<br />1. Me Against the Music - Never liked this. The music/Britney's singing/talking is slightly annoying. Madonna doesn't help any.        <BR>2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - I LOVE this song. My favorite, because the beat and the Ying Yang Twins rocks. Britney's voice never sounded better.        <BR>3. Showdown - Somehow it's addictive...Britney's voice is airy and it's just...      <BR>4. Breathe On Me - The weakest song. Reminds me of a Kylie Minogue song, just not as fun or done as well.   <BR>5. Early Mornin' - Her colliboration with Moby pays off here. There's an eerie feel and slightly \\"Southside-esque.\\"         <BR>6. Toxic - 2nd favorite song.  Great clubbing song.      <BR>7. Outrageous - Will get you moving!        <BR>8. Touch of My Hand - Nothing spectacular about this. Still worth a listen if you want to hear her sing about touching herself...        <BR>9. The Hook Up - Didn't like it at first. Got a reggae feel/beat. Loving it now.        <BR>10. Shadow - slower song. Still not a full-out ballad (thank god). Stll listenable.        <BR>11. Brave New Girl - Sounds like a theme song to something like Legally Blond. Very techno. There's Britney's \\"rapping.\\" Don't squirm. It's mostly electronized.         <BR>12. Everytime - Her lil \\"sorry song\\" to ex Justin. Like most of her other ballads on her other CDs.        <BR>13. Me Against the Music (featuring Madonna) Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix - Just a faster version of the first with some \\"hey heys!\\" thrown in. Not much of a remix... <br />All in all, it was worth the money I spent. Perfect for some clubbing or just to have a good time.
B000056NX5|5.0|Don't let the poor reviews of these theatre illetirate imbeciles affect your decision to rent this movie. To a trained theatre eye the technique and innovation of this show is emaculate. Judas executes his talent magnificently. His training at Cours Florent proves to be worthwile. Jesus show his ability in a more subtle way, playing the character to a tee.The set and costume design is one of a creative and contemporary edge. But I will say that you have to be able to have the ability to think logically and have an appreciation for theatre to thouroughly enjoy this movie.    I say buy it!!

B000077VR3|5.0|The fact that Baz Luhrman is a genius and Catherine Martin's designs are wonderful is only half of what makes this movie what it is. Kidman and Macgregor use their talent to it's full ability. The use of prewritten songs mixing with new songs is innovative and new. It creates a world where the audience knows it's not real. The costumes, set, cinimatography and everything else makes this a new beginning for musicals to flourish in todays society. Once again an appreciation for theatre must be in place in order to love the movie but the catchy songs make the film beautiful!   I say BUY IT!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|All of you whining pansies are a bunch of haters! You're all giving it bad reviews and talking about, &quot;Paul waited until John and George were gone&quot;. But George signed off his approval of the making of this disc. John didn't like the original either, he just hated Paul and was a contrarian. Whatever, man, the truth is that this new version really does make a world of difference. It's light-years ahead of the original, which felt like a soundtrack (complete with film sound-clips). This sounds like a honest-to-god Beatles record that can finally stand up with the other classics they made. Some of you think you already got the stripped-down version of the album on Anthology. While it is true that there was a stripped down version of Long And Winding Road, it was that wack version that has him talking over Billy Preston's solo (&quot;many times i've been alone....&quot;), and I'm looking at the Anthology now, and I don't see the stripped versions of Across the Universe, I Me Mine, or Get Back! Speaking of Across the Universe, all of you haters take note. Phil Spector took that song, slowed it down, eliminated the sitar for the most part, added strings, and put that annoying loudspeaker effect on John's voice. What we have now is exactly how John did it, how he thought it would be presented to the public.  As a matter of fact, playing the new album you will find anywhere from subtle to very outward differences in every song, not just the above-mentioned, and the differences are primarily in sound quality. Everything sounds better, and how is that a bad thing? They remaster albums all the time, they just did all that stuff to Dylan's canon. This happens to be the best remastering job I've ever heard (play any song from this and the original side by side and you'll know).<br />While all of you complain, I will state the truth...........With this album they did what Phil Spector tried to do 30 odd years ago, and it is a revelation. My only regret with this is the title. Get Back would have been much more appropriate. And all of you are wack-ass haters!!!!!!
B000089RVR|5.0|If you like DIDO then there is no way you can  dislike this CD.<BR>Soulful, Sadness with a beat.  :)
B00000JCOV|5.0|Anybody who says this band is crap should slit there wrists. This band is the band that will shape metal and give new light, or dark which ever you want, to metal. They give it there all in concert and on the CD. If you like metal like korn, MuDvAyNe and so forth buy this CD. IOWA, there other CD, is a good CD. There, technically, fourth CD will be released at the end of this year through spring. 2004 will be the year of slipknot.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life is by far my favorite Madonna album, and that's saying a lot! This is the kind of album you just put on and listen to all the way through. Before you realize it you'll be at the end and probably starting it over again if you're anything like me. What follows is a rundown of the album and what I think of the songs. Songs marked as &quot;T&quot; are what I'd term as techno tracks.<br />American Life -T- This is a great bouncy song that starts off the album in a great way. It really sets the tone of the album. 5/5<BR>Hollywood - Madonna's second single after &quot;American Life&quot; continues her retrospective look at her life in The Industry and how it has affected her. 5/5<BR>Stupid - Continuing the look at how her life has gone. 4/5<BR>Love Profusion - A sweet song which probably should have been put after the next track so that the 'love songs' would be nearer one another. 4/5<BR>Nobody Knows Me -T- Madonna lets everyone know that they Don't Know Jack about her. Motivates you to be an individual. 5/5<BR>Nothing Fails - Awesome song. This is the third single from the album, and one listen will show you why. 5/5<BR>Intervention - Another lovey dovey song. I like the guitar on it though. 4/5<BR>X-Static Process - This song has a melancholy sound to it which fits the sad lyrics. Just too slow for my taste. 4/5<BR>Mother and Father -T- Interesting song about her childhood. Sounds more like it belongs on &quot;Music&quot; than here. 3/5<BR>Die Another Day -T- Title track for the 007 film. Pretty much just here since it came out between Music and this album. 4/5<BR>Easy Ride - And awesome ending track like &quot;Gone&quot; was on Music. 5/5<br />This album proves that Madonna's continuing to grow and change as an artist. Some will like it and others won't.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've been a fan of Britney ever since &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; hit the radiowaves. Her music really started to slide after that first album, but this one is an exception.  She's got great new ideas for improving her music like hooking up with Madonna, the Ying Yang Twins, and R. Kelly for some songs.  It's got great beats to dance to and definitely new flavor to the tunes.  My favorites are &quot;I Got That Boom Boom&quot; and the remix of &quot;Me Against the Music.&quot;  I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who loves to dance and need something fun to listen to.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|If (like me) you're a Beatles fan and want to have different versions of some of their songs, get this album.  If you're not, don't.  Let It Be was always the Beatles' weakest album (their only weak album), so its silly to expect any revelations on a reissue, no matter what anyone does to it.  Now we can hear what the album might have sounded like if Spector hadn't gotten involved.  For those who criticize Paul McCartney for what he has supposedly done to this album, remember that he was there-you weren't!
B0000TB050|5.0|This is one of the best live Dvd's that I have ever seen. I have seen U2 in concert before, and this is very realistic.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|For a hardcore fan like myself, who has collected numerous bootlegs over the years, there was nothing here from a musical standpoint which was not already in my collection.  That was a disappointment.  The 3 anthology albums, as well as the BBC recordings, all provided material which even I had never heard before.  However, if you've heard the stripped down versions before (which many have), except for the improvement in sound quality, there is nothing here which will shed any new light on the Beatles magnificent legacy.  Even the liner notes seem a re-hash of things we've heard/read before.  As for the 2nd disc, I felt this was a total waste of time.  22 minutes of odd snippets which mean nothing out of context.  What was the purpose?<br />If, however, you are a fan who has never had access to the &quot;stripped down&quot; versions of these songs, it's well worth the purchase price; just ignore the 2nd disc.
6303165680|4.0|A runaway bestseller of a romantic comedy in England's best tradition. Tongue-in-cheek performances by Hugh Grant playing the bumbling, shambling, confused, stammering, charming, adorable, hopeless man as only he can do it, and Andie MacDowell, who is as smooth and composed as Grant is most decidedly NOT. He's a confirmed bachelor going to friends' weddings when he runs into her, and then a funeral intervenes. Then her wedding. Then his upcoming one...<BR>On and on it goes. We know how it's going to end. The surprising thing is that in spite of the predictability, it's full of pathos, charm, and some heartbreaking scenes that stick with viewers long after the final credits roll.<BR>Don't miss it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The &quot;Get Back&quot; album (named later as &quot;Let It Be&quot;) was recorded as an experiment in filming the band &quot;live in the studio&quot;: in the Anthology 3 album, at the end of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; song you can hear Lennon's words: &quot;Okay, let's track it... Ooh, you bounder, you cheat!&quot;, meaning that the song -as well as all the others- must remain without editions.<br />So, all the songs are played as the original purpose was: without editions, playing live with Billy Preston, who was invited to that sessions, and with the spirit of being part of a little big band.<br />If you are planning to get this disk hoping to hear anything else than just the Beatles, forget it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The extended version is much, much better than the theatrical version. (And I thought the theatrical release was pretty good.) The added scenes add so much to character development and plot. Faramir's character especially. The battle scenes at Helm's Deep are even more graphic and the documentaries are alot of fun to watch.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Well, first of all lets get some facts straight<br />1)I have been a huge Beatles fan my entire life<br />2)They were the most creative and influential music artists that have ever recorded<br />3)The Let It Be sessions contained some nuggets and was cast aside by the band members when they were more interested in doing their own thing.<br />4)The purchase of this CD is an ABSOLUTE MUST  ( for $13 how can you go wrong?) <br />5)The sound is superb and clean<br />6)Despite the stripped down songs , the original album \\" Let It Be \\" would not have come close to cracking their best 7 Albums..<br />7)Purchase it and enjoy the listen, but understand that there is so much more of theirs that holds solid 5 star ratings.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Seems like most reviewers are at extreme odds with TOT.  Is it 5 stars or 1 star?  To those who see TOT as a betrayal to the DT legacy, GET OVET IT!  This is progressive rock/metal.  It's supposed to be different each time out.  Most bands would sell their souls to create a CD like TOT.<br />This CD rocks harder than any previous DT offering.  The musicianship is undeniable.  It seems they're trying out-metal Metallica and nu-metal bands. For the most part, they suceed.  Sure beats St. Anger. <br />To those that see TOT as DT's masterpiece ... huh??  Love Portnoy and Petrucci but, how about some restraint.  The songs aren't strong enough to maintain this overdulgent showcasing.  It comes off sounding like speed for speed's sake.  I wonder, when in the recording process did someone say &quot;Screw the song, let's play really fast!&quot;  I could easily forgive the over the top approach, if it was in the context of better songs.<br />By the way, John Myung and Jordan Ruddess are brilliant with the little they are given. As usual, loved James LaBrie (and the vocal effects).  <br />TOT is a good CD ... not their best and certainly not their worst.  Strangely, it has made me appreciate Awake more.  Write better songs and no one will complain about how you play'em.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|It is surprising to see a new Dream Theater album so soon; _Six Degrees..._ was only released in January 2002. Interestingly, this album is pretty different from their last few. A lot of the prog trappings are internalized into what are basically long, complex metal songs. On the prog spectrum, this is a concentrated metal reaction to the more \\"proggy\\" orientation of _Six Degrees..._. What one gets out of _Train of Thought_ will likely depend on their affinity to metal -- while not at all divorced from their prog sensibilities, the metal features of the band are reemphasized.<br />For the most part it's pretty good. Unfortunately it starts poorly with \\"As I Am\\", a song that sounds like DT employed Bob Rock to help them write it. It has some sneaky, tricky time changes but... all in all it sounds uncomfortably like something that belongs on Metallica's black album and approaches a level of cheesiness that you almost think has to be a sophisticated put-on. The main riff and distortion makes me think of frogs being stepped on. I must admit it's catchy, but I resent its catchiness.<br />Fortunately, things improve from there. \\"This Dying Soul\\" is what \\"The Glass Prison\\" would sound like if it were a good song -- a grim, high-velocity prog metal barrage that demonstrates Dream Theater's best strengths. Heavy, chugging, shifting time signatures, with some surprisingly dark sounding rhythms at parts. The keyboards are barely evident until a (unnecessary) flourishing piano part and the (stunning) guitar-keys unison barrage at the end.<br />Some of the songs demonstrate some good prog metal. The best parts of all the songs in my opinion is their craziest, most wild prog metal parts and LTEesque passages. \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is really excellent DT track with flickering, pensive verses, a huge crunchy chorus, and wacky LTEesque instrumental part. The instrumental \\"Stream of Consciousness\\", based on a gritty, fabulous, epic riff, has an evocative current and thematic progression. Full of tricky rhythmic interplay, wild melodies, sludgy grooves, and put together into a brilliant flow, this is one of the best songs Dream Theater has done. There're a lot of cool parts, but there isn't really anything unexpected. Maybe the odd, electronic sounding middle part of \\"In the Name of God\\" or the strange rap-like vocals and nu-metal-ish trappings on \\"Honor Thy Father\\", or the short, bittersweet ballad (complete with cello), \\"Vacant\\". However, moments of real boldness and ingenuity are scarce. This is a Dream Theater album where we are clearly seeing diminishing returns. The problem lies in that fact that DT has started to make fewer meaningful explorations and as a result music is becoming somewhat predictable and superficial. Unfortunately, Dream Theater's aspirations here are kind of trivial and a lot of the most interesting stuff on _Train of Thought_ sounds like they stumbled onto it by accident. But then again, the band DID say they wanted to focus on the metal, so maybe the next one will be more experimental. (Personally i'd like to see DT marry the experimental and their mastery of metal-prog to get something really wild.)<br />Gauged as a prog metal album by a prog metal band, _Train of Thought_ is certainly more respectable. It's well produced, the instrumental parts are pretty cool, there's some delicious riffs and complex metal shredfests with dueling guitars and keys. The drumming is a little dull and tacky by Portnoy's standards, however. The problems with this album are general attributes of Dream Theater's metal-prog aesthetic, so at least they cannot be faulted for inconsistency. The important question: does _Train of Thought_ overcome prog metal's inherent cheesiness? Sort of -- DT is quite convincing in reducing the cheese-factor. Many effects are used on James LaBrie's voice to integrate it better with the heavier sound (as talented a singer as he is, his is not a _heavy_ metal voice). Keyboards in metal are especially dangerous,and here they are mostly bizarro tones placed well behind the blasting guitars. Rudess is less prominent in the music, overall, but the way he fills in the gaps between layers with gravelly synths is often effective, and his lead tone sounds a lot better.<br />In a lot of ways _Train of Thought_ is about the same as a Cirque du Soleil show: lots of glowing aesthetics but pretty shallow. All in all I find this album pretty enjoyable, although I find it a little long and get a little restless as it goes on. \\"In the Name of God\\" and \\"Honor Thy Father\\", for me, could have used some more stringent pruning, although they both have some great parts. The album is easier to digest if I skip the first song (which is pretty weak). All in all, it's entertaining and prog metal fan(boy)s will probably eat it like pie.and here they are mostly bizarro tones placed well behind the blasting guitars.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|It`s hard to believe after watching this DVD that this film was made over 35 years ago.  Unbelievable color,picture and sound, it looks like it was just made! Must have!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|What bothers me when it comes to Britney is how people who don't even like her to begin with will put in their two cents when it comes to her music.  Sure, she may not have the greatest voice, she admits that herself.  Sure, she lip syncs maybe a little too much. But who cares, she puts on an awesome energetic show.  If you don't like her, close your ears or listen to something else. \\"In The Zone\\" is a music extravaganza chocked full of sexiness, and not the overt \\"Dirrty\\" kind.  I am sure she didn't set out to make a Carol King \\"Tapestry\\" or Fleetwood Mac \\"Rumours\\", but who cares.  Music shouldn't have to always be so \\"will it be a classic 40 years from now?\\"  Big deal, let the girl have some fun. It's a much better cd then her last three.  If you liked \\"I'm A Slave...\\", you'll like the whole cd.  Standouts are \\"Boom Boom\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", and the ballad \\"Everytime\\".  If you are not a Britney fan, never have been and you consider yourself \\"anti-Brit\\", don't even bother listening to the cd.  But if you want something interesting and unique and aren't afraid of a little sexiness, give it a whirl, you may be surprised at just how catchy the songs really are.
0452282152|5.0|If Vermeer had written a novel, this is the language he would have used. The effect of Chevalier's words is very, very similar to the effect of Vermeer's brushstrokes. The story is painfully beautiful and believable. (Very little factual information is known about Vermeer, and his body of work is very small.) From what I have heard through a close friend of Chevalier, she did her research in the Netherlands (as one would hope), and it shows in this marvelous book! Other recent books I recommend: Life Of Pi by Martel, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B00005JMFO|5.0|Just the tonic needed during my fall break from college.  This movie is not only British, has Hugh Grant and Emma Thompson, but was directed by Ben Curtis, who wrote Four Weddings and Notting Hill.  Love Actually begins with a voiceover by Hugh Grant affirming that if anyone needs evidence of love, take a look at the airports of people being reunited with their friends, family, etc.  He even says that when the twin towers fell, the last phone calls to the families from the victims were surely those of love.<br />The story examines the stories of many many people here.  First off, there is the newly elected prime minister, (Hugh Grant, who else?) who's unmarried and soon starts falling for Natalie, his pretty assistant who's self-conscious about her weight, although it's not so apparent here.  It's his feelings towards her that later leads him to face down the U.S. president.  He says that the UK may be smaller than the US, but it's still a great country, the country of Shakespeare, The Beatles, and Harry Potter.  The bits with the PM are the best, as his personality is seen more in the romantic and comical scenes.  Marine McCutcheon plays Natalie as a lovable character with a cute accent and voice, and is one of the brighter stars here.<br />The PM$B!G(Bs sister Karen is married to Harry, the head of a designs firm who's gained the flirtateous eye of his secretary Mia.  He's also got Sarah, an employee who is in love with another employee, Carl, but both are too shy to admit it.  Harry encourages Sarah to take the plunge.<br />Then there's Daniel (Liam Neeson), who's recently lost his wife Joanna and has the difficult task of looking after his stepson Sam.  He can't stay sad for long, as Sam has fallen in love with an American girl in his class, a girl named Joanna, yes, like the mother/wife, who's pretty but doesn't know he exists.  Trying to figure out how to get the two together bonds stepfather and son together.<br />The funniest involves Billy Mack, an outrageous but cynical, craggy-faced mid-fifties rock star who speaks his mind and trying to make a comeback by doing a Christmas remake of the Troggs' \\"Love Is All Around,\\" which was done in another Curtis-penned film by Wet Wet Wet, Four Weddings.  He's facing competition from a new generation, a boy band Blue, for the hallowed Christmas #1 single and even promises to sing it naked if he wins.  His remarks cause no end of consternation to his overweight, long-suffering, but faithful manager.  Example: $B!H(BKids, this is a message from your Uncle Billy. Don't buy drugs. Wait until you're a rock star, and they give them to you for free!$B!I(B  And his music video bears a strong resemblance to Robert Palmer$B!G(Bs $B!H(BAddicted To Love.$B!I(B<br />Jamie, nursing wounds of a bad relationship, goes to France to write a novel, and rents a lakeside cabin typing a novel.  He takes in Aurelia, a Portuguese woman who acts as his maid.<br />The most outrageous is that of Colin, a red-haired guy with a manic look about him who thinks the only way to score is to go to America and hook up with some chicks.  His black friend thinks he's crackers.<br /> Love Actually has a smidgin of the Happenstance formula in it--where many disparate people in the story come together or turn out to know someone else in the movie.  And just when one thinks things can$B!G(Bt get any better, Rowan Atkinson, Shannon Elizabeth, and Denise Richards appear!

B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie is one of my favorite artists ever. I really like her subtleness. She isn¡¯t of those wannabe hard-core acts. She is true R&B ¨Cthe music from the soul. Her debut single, ¡°Video¡± was very impressive. I watched it on this ¡°latest music videos¡± program, which got axed (sadly), in 2001. I remembered being blown away by the song and the gal, and as I went to school that day, I was thinking of the lyrics: ¡°I¡¯m not the average girl from your video, but I learnt to love myself unconditionally because I am a queen.¡± And soon started to cry? It really made me feel. At that time I was/am not confident, and I didn¡¯t have inner love. I was in young adolescence and a bit depressed ¨Creally lost! Unfortunately after watching the video I was thinking to myself: <br />Such a shame that India ain¡¯t famous, and that her album/single wouldn¡¯t ever be released in Australia¡­ FASTFORWARD¡­ <br />Then in 2002 when the Grammy¡¯s were on. Didn¡¯t even think much of India.Arie Simpson or Alicia Keys, but then I got A. Keys¡¯ debut and loved it. Then after 3 months, I felt my musical diversity was lacking. And I saw an article on Lamya Al Mughiery. And I decided to check her out @ cdnow.com and saw India.Arie on the related artists list. And I pre-ordered Lamya¡¯s CD, and went to the shop and got India.Arie¡¯s ¡°Acoustic Soul¡± and ¡°Voyage To India¡±. And I tell you now that India has been one of my fav artists ever since. <br />What I love about her is that she is subtle, real, intelligent, freethinker, different and not a crowd follower. She reminds me of Renee Geyer. She¡¯s as talented as Alicia Keys. It¡¯s just she¡¯s different from her. They both write great songs and can play musical instruments. So I reckon India.Arie should¡¯ve won ALBUM OF THE YEAR at the Grammys instead of U2. At first I loved Voyage better than Acoustic, but it¡¯s only been recently that I¡¯ve discovered the beautiful pure vocal arrangements and the usage of warm instruments with personal themes and messages. I now see how ¡°Acoustic Soul¡± is so good. It¡¯s chapter 1 while ¡°voyage¡± is chapter 2. <br />The album has musical variety considering most of the tracks are acoustic guitar based. ¡°Video¡± is an ode to self-love, acceptance and approval, which many people ¨Cnot only teens have trouble with. All of her songs have a Christian touch to it. As India is a very spiritual person. ¡°Ready 4 Love¡± is also a very touching track. I remember thinking back to the lyrics on the bus and how they related to situation of mine. Other great picks are ¡°Interludes¡±, ¡°Promises¡±, ¡°I See God In You¡±, sweet ¡°Beautiful¡± and the wonderful ¡°Wonderful¡±. <br />I believe it¡¯s her natural tunes and lyrics, which make her one of my fav singer-songwriters. I¡¯m eagerly waiting for Chapter 3. <br />Note: If you listen to her music, then forget it and put it down for a while and get back to it. You¡¯ll discover the magic of it.<br />I gave this album a (5), not because every song is a hit. But because there is so much soul on it.
B0000C1733|3.0|I think alot of this cd captures some of the best songs RHCP have ever recorded, however there are some songs should be on here,and some that should be taken off. I could have lied, is one of my favorite songs from the RHCP but its not on here just because it wasn't released as a single. I dont like greatest hits where all they have is songs with videos or released on the radio. Others that should have been included is Sikamikanico from Waynes World, Aeroplane, Can't stop, which was released as a video, and Love Rollercoaster. These should have replaced Higher ground, Universally Speaking, Road Trippin, and the 2 new songs which i didnt care for very much, or just simply should have been added on to the compulation. I felt the same about the Nirvana greatest hits released last year. The RHCP Greatest hits is good, but you might be better off just buying the classic Blood Sugar Sex Majik.
6305358613|1.0|This movie wants to be the British answer to the \\"Queen Margot\\" with Isabelle Adjani - and fails. Like \\"Queen Margot\\" it's a \\"dirty\\" historical film - I mean, literally. Everybody looks like they've never taken a bath in their lives, greasy hair and all. You can almost smell the stench just by watching it. I'm sure that may be very historically accurate, but I dislike it just the same. It's very arty, very pretentious, with lots of violence and irreverence toward historical figures. Life's too short. ... Enough.<BR>Cate Blanchet looks ridiculous, but never more so than when she's dancing, relaxing and flirting. That's not how you get to be one of the most famous female monarchs in history. One would never understand, by watching this movie, what was the big deal about Elizabeth, and how she earned the respect of posterity.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Nothing against this new release.  But, after reading the Beatles Recording Sessions about a billion times, I really was hoping they would have given us the original Glyn Johns Produced Get Back Album with Let it Be and 12 other songs.  Complete with the cover tunes they played.  Not their best, but still historic and not a rehash of the same stuff.  Because the Let it Be (Soundtrack) was never what they originally intended, in any form; be it from song order to song editing. (Thanks to Anthology 3 we can see Spector taking great creative freedom in chopping up John's intro to I Dig A Pony.)<BR>This album should have never seen the light a day.  But we're glad because then we would never have gotten gems like Two of Us, or Let it Be with George's awesome guitar solo.<BR>But, thinking about things they can release that wouldn't be rehashing the same old thing, I wish they would release the original Decca Tapes (yeah, the one that Brian Epstein carried around all over London looking a record label).<BR>We only got a smattering of this with Anthology 1.  Give us the whole thing.  Let us hear what George Martin heard when he decided that he had nothing to lose in signing them.<BR>So,<BR>1. I want the Original Get Back <BR>2. Decca Tapes (the whole thing)
078401115X|4.0|It's moody and beautiful. It has a laid back feel to it without ever getting boring.<br>Mickey Rourke and Robert De Niro are both at their best in this movie.<br>Rourke strikes just the right cord of vulnerability, boyish charm, and danger he always strived for. He always had that screen persona of the guy who doesn't quite know why he's always getting in trouble when deep down inside he's really such a good boy after all - and at least in this movie the explanation is perfect as a dream.<br>As for Robert de Niro, he's definitive as a diable grand seigneur, the devil in his most chivalrous, gentlemanly form, almost effeminate. He's unforgettable, not a trace of overacting, totally in control, totally believable.<br>Lisa Bonet is too urban and articulate to play a deep south country girl who's this sort of voodoo witch. She's not very convincing, and Charlotte Rampling comes and goes without making any impression, but it's the movie itself that's worth your while, it really is.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Um, where do I start? I started listening to Radiohead about a year and a half ago....went in the wrong order - started with The Bends, moved onto Pablo Honey, OK Computer next, followed by Kid A, Amnesiac and I Might Be Wrong. Every album's sonically different and has a completely different attitude to the previous one. Hail To The Thief follows suit. Of course, like most Radiohead fans I plugg the newest release whilst secretly pining for the music of The Bends....<br />When I first listened to it I thought Hail To The Thief had some really great moments (There There, 2+2=5) and some pretty dull ones (The Gloaming, We Suck Young Blood) and the rest was &quot;alright&quot;. I went to see them live about two days ago (they were bloody brilliant of course). Was blown away. Everyone went beserk and the old masterpieces (Fake Plastic', Exit Music, Karma Police, Street Spirit etc...) - which were amazing but obviously most of the material was off HTTT. I had no choice but to face up to the new material, really listen to it. All the other reviewers are right. You HAVE to stick with it. Try and relax and just listen to this album.<br />Hopefully you'll love the simple guitar and raising melody of Scatterbrain, the boogie jazz piano on Sit Down, Stand Up and Punchup', and all the delicate composition behind the rest of the songs, cos thats the thing about this band, everything seems like it was meticulously put there, adding another layer to your senses. You might get it but maybe you won't (hence only four stars)...the band has moved on, they're more political, electrical, sensitive and dark but the fans who are loosing faith, why don't you try and change with them? Sure its not the crunchy guitars off The Bends or swooning strings from How to Disappear'....but its still Radiohead underneath.
B00005JMF6|4.0|It's a VERY rare occurrence that I'll be totally drawn into a movie, but Gothika did it.  It did, however, manage to thoroughly traumatise me.  I've watched slasher films and laughed, and watched psychological horror with grinning anticipation, and while I am glad to have watched this (it was very cathartic and EXTREMELY well made) I don't think I'll be watching it again.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I enjoy listening to this record. It may not be their best, but it is a damn good one. I can't await to see them perform this live, possibly with some of the classics (Master Of Puppets, Number Of The Beast) and some of their own true masterpieces like Learning To Live, SFAM or ACOS (if you know what I mean you're worthy to continue reading this review ;-)).<br />The production is awesome, the singing is quite nice (I'm pleased to hear that James LaBrie doesn't has to scream is lungs out on this recording, it's all in his live range).<br />If there's one thing I miss, then it's the weird parts they had on SFAM ... this is 70/30 Metal/Prog., where SFAM was 50/30/20 Prog/Metal/Classical.<br />I'm entirely confident that the next record will again be completely different ...
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I thought I'd give this album a chance; I can admit I have never been a fan of hers, seeing as how I think someone in the music industry should actually possess singing talent, but I decided to check out the hype on this CD.  Big mistake...aside from the fact that an obscene amount of electronica is used to mask and distort her poor excuse for a voice, the beats are simply too repetitious to enjoy - I could scarcely tell when the songs changed from one to another, as they all are mind-numbingly alike and seem to drone on forever - once she gets past the two main verses, she simply repeats the chorus over and over again to the end of the song.  There is no depth to the subject matter here; she seems anxious to follow the example set last year by Christina Aguilera and prove to the world that she is a sexual being and grown up now by injecting sexually-oriented lyrics into virtually every song, which is fine but the lyrics really do not vary that much from song to song.  As a side note, in her recent interview with Barbara Walters, she seemed apologetic most of the time when discussing the content of this CD, such as the song \\"Touch of my Hand,\\" a song about masturbation; if she gets flushed and cannot even discuss her own songs without resorting to silly giggles and weakly trying to defend her decision to record a song such as this, how are we supposed to believe she has any type of emotional attachment to her \\"work\\" or that she actually feels and believes in what she is singing?  I didn't make it through this entire CD because I literally had to turn it off before I got even halfway through.  I don't see how this album could reflect the inner workings of a complex mind, seeing as how 1 - she only wrote half of the songs, and 2 - there is absolutely nothing personal on this album, nothing that makes it stand out as a creation that only Britney could have made because it truly speaks about who she is.  One final turnoff is the horrendously mismatched collaborations (Yin Yang Twins???) that make the songs seem way too out of her element and desperate to cross musical boundaries; their grunting and groaning is way out of place compared to her thin wispy voice that cannot even carry a tune.  In many of the songs, her voice is so altered and masked by the music (such as \\"Toxic\\") that it's virtually impossible to distinguish what she is even saying - a bit of a news flash to the producers:  we already know her voice is weak and tuneless and the layers of electronics on top do not hide this; if you're going to alter her voice so that less critical listeners will not pick up on her nasally tones, at leave it in understandable English!  Even if she did exhibit some ability to display emotion about her subject matter (other than panting or moaning), there is no way we could hear it.  Bottom line - if it's songwriting you seek, do not buy this album; if it's interesting and relevant subject matter you seek, do not buy this album, and if it's credibility, talent and competence you seek, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I cannot believe that this other guy wrote something like &quot;if only this was the new Spock's Beard album with different lyrics but the same music&quot; ... and you claim to be a &quot;long time prog listener&quot;?<br />You cannot separate the music from the lyrics with this one, no way.<br />This is a masterpiece, there's no other way to describe it. It's far better than Snow, maybe not concerning production or &quot;polish&quot;, but regarding the music and the message. And no, I'm not Christian, in fact I don't believe in any God. But I'm open for discussion ...<br />The interested listener will find many tunes from Snow hidden in the complex arrangements in this recording. In a way, Snow was a hint of things to come (&quot;I Will Go&quot; ...). But listening to Testimony, it's clear that this is more related to Neal than Snow, there's a message where Snow only avoided conclusions. <br />Those who long for the &quot;old&quot; Spock's Beard and wish Neal hadn't left: Listen to &quot;Sid&quot;, the concept piece from the new Spock's Beard album ... now this sounds just like Snow, but stripped of all the heart and emotion ... I'm beginning to understand why Neal left the band. They're fantastic musicians, but they're not what Spock's Beard was about. <br />Seems like Neal has returned from the parallel universe he was exploring ... now he has finally shaved ;-)
0385504209|5.0|I'm glad I read this book before all the news hoopla came out.  It made me go, hmmmm.  I could only think that Dan Brown was able to make his points regardless of what all the other priests/scholars thought.  As though they would actually admit that there is a conspiracy to keep the Priory of Sion secret and that the world should never know about Jesus and Mary Magdalene.  I, for one, still do not see proof that Jesus existed, so by that notion, neither did the apostles as they are listed.  As a literary document, the bible is a fantastic read.  Dan Brown just takes it a little further.  Makes me wonder that if Jesus existed, MaryMagdalene was an apostle and they were married then the Church should rejoice.  I would like to know the truth.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This is an amazing collection of unreleased material.<br />There are songs here from every era and line-up of the band.  These are songs that were not put onto the studio albums, were put on benefit albums, or were just somehow lost in the mix.  I won't go into a song by song analysis, because that would be useless and annoying.  Everyone will have a different favorite, and deep down I know that you don't care what mine is.<br />We live in a time where it is scary to spend hard-earned money on a CD because they so often contain a couple of good songs and a bunch of filler.  But here comes Pearl Jam.  They release a double disc set of songs that they just had lying around, and it is an incredible collection from start to finish.  The evolution of the band is easily traced through these songs also.  It is easy to follow the maturing of the band in this collection of songs.  They just keep getting better and better.<br />What an embarrassing collection this should be to other bands.  Pearl Jam has 30 songs of this quality just lying around.  There are more good &quot;extra&quot; songs here than some bands ever manage to write.  <br />There is only one thing that I would change about this collection.  I would include the song &quot;Crazy Mary&quot; from the Sweet Relief Disc.  This is a cover of a Victoria Williams song and is just incredible.  The Sweet Relief disc is worth buying just for the Pearl Jam song, although there are other gems on it also, such as covers by Lou Reed, Soul Asylum, Michelle Shocked, Michael Penn, and others.<br />In conclusion, I would like to say, BUY THIS DISC.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000844M8|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I first saw it as a child, and recently ordered the DVD version of the movie from Amazon.com. The movie brought back alot of memories, and I believe it has lost little impact from the time it was originally released in the mid-1960s. The story is a great one, the scsnerey in the movie is beautiful, and the acting is very good. The performance of the lioness in the film is spectacular.<br /> What I find particularly pleasing, in comparison with the movies of today, is the absence of human-on-human violence, sex, car chases, explosions, special effects, etc. This movie stands alone on its own merit - the power of the storyline and the heartwarming, though sad, story of the lioness named Elsa. People of all ages and backgrounds who have a great appreciation for nature and life will definitely enjoy this movie.
B0000CAQ27|5.0|I have listened to the awesome album of PINKS and she still rocks so all of you that are not musically inclined WOULD think this is not an outstanding artist. I have  been a loyal listener and album purchaser of hers from the get go and I must say I LOVE this one PINK!!! Especially OMG, Love song, Trouble, While I'm sleeping. And all of the others. The cover is HOT!!! and so are the songs on it. Keep up the good work PINK- your #1 so.cali fan
B00005YW4H|4.0|This is the type of music I want to hear when I have friends over for dinner, or just want to settle in at home and feel cozy and romantic.  Wanna dance?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's new album is amazin'. you see hOw she has grOwn intO a wOman, and is nO longer writing that teen bOpper stuff. Her sOngz are great. She has her ballads that make yOu wanna cry and remember Old times with a lOve One. Then she has sOme dance trackz that make yOu wanna &quot;grab a partner, take it dOwn&quot;. I've been a Brit fan fOr yearz. This album is her best yet!. It's a purchase yOu wOn't regret.
B00009MGQL|5.0|It is curious, it is strange, it is electronic but it is an incredibly modern and creative album. I love this cd. Sure it is strange and I suggest to take a brief listening before you purchase the disc.  But Jeff shines as always. When I think to the other guitar players of his era and how they sound dated, old and boring Jeff seems a genius to me. He is so contemporary! Can you believe this guy played in the Yardbirds a millenium ago? He sounds incredibly modern still today no matter the kind of music he plays. He sounds more modern than &quot;his son&quot;, Joe Satriani!  I love listening to him playing his whammy bar effects, his incredibly lyrical lines.  He is without a doubt one of the overall masters of the instruments and every album from him deserve to be listened. I don't care if Jeff himself is quoted to say he hates this record. He is not the only great guitar player who doesn't like to hear himself. Pat Metheny is another one who thinks not to be so good.  Sonny Rollins after Saxophone colossus (one of the best Jazz album's ever!) decided to change completly his way of playing the sax. The same thing happened to Coltrane before Giant steps and he was already a Jazz giant!! So I think it is not important what  musicians think of themselves. Listen to me instead. This is a curious, strange, modern but really beautiful album. Another gem from Jeff.
B00005OM4N|3.0|I love to dance and thats why I dig Britney. Not because she can sing (she cant) not because her music has a soul (it doesnt). I listen to it because I can put it in and dance and have fun. I listen to it in the car because its upbeat, and as much as I suck I can outsing her. Im writing this a few days after her 4th album came out...Britney trying to be taken seriously as an artist, how sad. Oops. Back to THIS album. Good, happy, sassy songs. Good beats to dance to. Sort of [suggestive] but still ok for the younger set. Very cute, I dig this album.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is possibly the best movie to come out in the past 5 or 10 years.  This DVD is packed with all kinds of goodies.  The story for the movie is equal if not better than the story in the book it was based on, which is VERY rare.  I suggest the book and the movie to anyone and everyone who isn't exactly pleased with the way the world is ordered and run.  Enjoy.
B000002BQK|4.0|She co writes alot of her stuff...not that its so deep. This was the last album she did before getting into soft porn. Whenever You Call is really sweet, and Honey is very catchy and danceable. Daydream is still her best album.
B00005YU1O|1.0|i don't get it. it may be because i'm stupid, though.
B0000039QA|5.0|I love this album, still listen to it. He was great, very few songs need to be skipped over on this one.
B00008RV1L|4.0|I confess I didn't care about this seemingly pretentious movie the first time I saw it. But it  is a daring movie, and its sordid potrayal of a whacko's life is certainly not recommended for the faint of heart. If you look beyond the gore (which is perhaps incidental to the plot) it's actually quite a piquant satirical take on a superficial, greed orientated society.<br />The violence here is not gratuitous, at least to me it did not seem to be a convenient vehicle to make a voyeuristic film and shock audiences.  It surely is not a movie that investigates the innards of a psychotic killer's mind as some reviewers lament.<br />Ostentatiously, the plot is about an eccentric Wall Street yuppie Patrick Bateman (played brilliantly by Christian Bale) whose life revolves around the superficial trappings of materialism -- parties at swank bars, 1500 dollar Valentino suits, threesomes with professional women etc etc.  At first you are struck with the utter weirdness of this guy's mannerisms, no one would associate with this wacko in real life.  Bateman's attempts to out-do his peers and be noticed and accepted get more and more pathologically brutal and heinous as the story progresses. But, despite his insanity, he's desperate to be caught. The confession at the end which draws total dismissal from his peers, just reiterates the kind of society we're in.<br />We have a smattering of super-sardonic moments, the crescendo reached when we witness a business card comparison match between corporate peers. Or hotel reservations, the ultimate badge of Who's Who.<br />The film has very subtle undertones if you are willing to read between the lines. For a genre that is too often too campy, too violent without cause, and too brainless, American Psycho is a breath of fresh air. It appears campy at first. It is violent, especially towards women. But it is not brainless. I'd say it is even well written.<br />Take the time to actually watch this movie and think about it. You'll see there's much more than meets the eye.s much more than meets the eye.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Im not 1 of those who wish I could give &quot;Zone&quot; 0*. I give it 1* for its sort of good 2 dance 2. Thats the only reason I ever *kind of* liked Brit - its fun 2 dance 2 &amp; sing along w/ her stupid songs; it feels good as while Im no singer, even I outshine her vocally. Here, shes trying 2B serious, as if she matters. She cant pull this off. Half the album is her breathing heavy &amp; hispering the other half is try-hard beats that really dont go with her &quot;voice&quot; or style. Blatant ripoffs of other crap music that was popular in past years is abound on this record. Shes an image, not an artist. I hope her time has passed and I want her 2 go away now...make room 4 the next tarty tramp 2 make souless crap 4 us 2 get jiggy with. PS I hate to think of the impact this is could have on her stupid preteen girl fans...oh the humanity.
B0000TB03W|5.0|well worth the sticker price, you get all the  entertainment  of a live show, with out the concert ticket price. you'll be glad you bought it!
B00005AQF7|5.0|Few if any songs need to be skipped over...Ten years old and I still listen to this. Fun stuff.
B0000TB03W|5.0|In her new DVD/album titled UP! Shania dazzels her audience yet again with her strong vocals. This DVD is well worth the $$$ in the entertainment you will receive.
B00005AQE8|3.0|Its ok but I skip over too many songs...Just get a greatest hits album instead hee hee
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Let me start by saying that I grew up listening to the Beatles and owned every one of their albums.  I replaced many of these albums with cassettes and have since purchased CDs of my favorites.  I eagerly awaited the release of this CD and purchased it the day it hit the stores.<br />All that being said, I was disappointed by this reworking of a classic Beatle album.  In my opinion, John Lennon was and always will be the driving force behind the group.  The original album had a strength that the reworked version does not.  Sure, some of the songs work better without the added orchestrations - \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" for example.  I even like \\"Across the Universe\\" naked.  However, the reworked versions of \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"Get Back\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" are really weak.  In fact, on \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" their voices are completely out of synch, flat and out of harmony.  The added \\"wall of sound\\" really pulled these songs together and put some punch in them.  \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" without the added orchestration simply does not work.  The original version was truly powerful but the new version is embarrassing in its nudity!<br />As far as I'm concerned, disk 2 in this set is a throwaway.  One listen is all it will ever get from me.<br />Maybe this CD could never have lived up to its hype.  I expected to be blown away but instead was only mildly impressed.  John Lennon and Phil Spector made the original memorable.  This version, while certainly an inventive idea is not going to be something I will play repeatedly and cherish.  Too bad.
B00005MKA1|5.0|All great songs. I love this album. Its like his &quot;Love song&quot; album. Very sweet and realxing.
B00006CXXU|5.0|At first I didn't want to buy this CD because I was put off buy her image. Once I did though I was amazed to discover that she has grown up whereas other pop stars (aka Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake) still follow closely to their pop past. <br />1. Stripped part 1 - (10/10) - This part basically tells what the album means to her. She is trying to say that she cannot be pup into a category such as pop and that she's not going to try and fit into anything that someone wants her to be. She's going to be herself. Very good opening...<br />2. Can't Hold us Down ft. Lil Kim - (7/10) - I really like this song, but gave it a lower rating because of the fact that it gets tired after hearing it all over the radio..I still love it though. It's all about how men can basically be male sluts and have no problem, but when a girl does it she gets called a whore. Talks about the double standards  between men and women. I think it was supposed to be taking a shot at Eminem for some of the things he said about Christina. <br />3. Walk Away - (10/10) - I LOVE this song! Her voice is so emotional and the song is creative...sounds like she is singing actual poetry. Talks about how she can't leave someone or something that she knows she should.<br />4. Fighter - (9/10) - This song has more of a rock edge. I like it because of the message. It tells you that when someone hurts you, thank them because in the end they are mnaking you stronger than you were before. She seems very angry on this song, but in a good way. Excellent song.<br />5. Interlude - (6/10) - Sounds pretty...but since its in spanish I have no idea what she is saying. I think she probably put it there to help create a mood for the next song along with allowing spanish speaking people to know what she is saying. It just shows another side of her.<br />6. Infatuated - (9/10) - This song has a cool Latin beat. Tells how she fell in love with this man that she wasn't sure she should have. Voice sounds unique on this track.<br />7. Loves Embrace Interlude - (5/10) - Kinda sounds like Mariah Carey...she sounds great but I don't like Mariah Carey and thats probably why I rated it a little low. <br />8. Loving me 4 me - (8/10) - This is a slow love song talking about a man that she deeply loves. It's sweet...but not one of the best tracks.<br />9. Impossible - (8/10) - This song is with Alicia Keys. Has a cool kind of Jazz tempo... I like it but again nothing standout.<br />10. Underappreciated - (9/10) - This song made me laugh the first time I heard it...made me think of a big gospel choir and I don't know why. It's a good song about how she gave a lot in a relationship and didn't get it back.<br />11.Beautiful - (10/10) - As the song title says this song is beautiful. I loved the video for this because it really sent the message of the song through. THat no matter what anyone thinks there are beautiful things in a person, whether on the inside or out. Her voice sounds kinds bluesy to me...or maybe thats the wrong category but I cant think of the one i mean to say.<br />12. Make Over - (9/10) - This is a fun song about how she doesn't want anyone trying to \\"make her over\\". Basically another song about how she wants to stay true to herself, which is admirable in the music business.<br />13. Cruz - (10/10) - Just a beautiful song....<br />14. Soar - (9/10) - a great inspirational song...stays with the theme of staying true to yourself...<br />15. Get Mine Get Yours- (8/10) - One of her \\"dirty\\" songs I suppose. It basically talks about casual sex. Still a fun song...once again she is still being true she isnt lying about anything.<br />16. Dirrty ft. Redman - (10/10) - This one was not received well here because of the video mostly. It is a song about sex once again but I think its fun. The people that objected to it said she catered these songs to young children...Im pretty sure she made it clear that she was trying to attract grown  up audiences...but either way don't let your little 10 year old listen to this then..its that simple.<br />17. Stripped Part 2 - (9/10) Continuation of saying what she is. She says basicallt she is what she is.<br />18.The Voice Within- (10/10) - Beautiful...Nice and slow. Tells about how when you have no where else to look for help that you can find it in yourself. <br />19. I'm OK - (11/10) -This song is heartbreaking. It's about how when she was younger (i think this is true but either way) her father physically abused her and her mother. At times you can here her voice break. This fits into her them of being stripped because she is showing one of her most secret things. Gives me goosebumps everytime I hear it.<br />20. Keep on singing my song - (8/10) - Basically ending with the whole message of the album, whether you like her or not she's going to keep doing what she wants, because that is who she is. <br />Overall this is an EXCELLENT album! She is leagues away from Britney...who sings all about sex. CHristina knows how to have fun and be serious at the same time. Glad I finally learned to look past what she looks like on the outside.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I like to dance and this album has some great dancing songs. Its superficial crap but who cares. This is sluttier than her first album but still ok for the younger set (disregarding her videos). Cute and fun, I still put this on and dance and have a good time.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|What to say...She tries so hard to make an adult album that is more like listening to the soundtrack of a pornographic movie. Adulthood is not all bout sex honey...learn to grow up a little. The songs are okay but her voice is overshadowed by the beats of the song. Not that I mind because her voice isnt that good to begin with. She's average and mainly sells because she is good looking. Personally, I rather listen to Christina Aguilera, who may be just as trashy looking but at least has some moral lessons in her song. She is also more talented. Overall this CD isnt even worth glancing at...it's a space filler.
B000002AVF|4.0|Sweet songs, fun songs. Great album. Of all her albums this is the one that you will skip the fewest songs. The album before she began the skank-ifying process. Isnt she in porn now?
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a great album. The best ever mede I think. She improve the sound. This album shows that shes a woman now. We can expect a great show too. I hope a better show than Dream within a dream....
B0000DD7LB|5.0|number one, britney is not a lesbian, she is an ENTERTAINER! that business has many different requirements whether they are outrageous or mellow! britney is the hotest pop star out right now and she made more than anyone in 2002! even more that J'Lo! she is extrememly talented and doesn't need jealous idiots doggin' her out! when it comes down to it, you probably just wish you were as tight as she is! she is going to go far in her career! and what do you have? hmm? exactly! grow up and leave the girl alone! number two, i honestly believe her new album is going to be a hit with the adult listeners like it is meant to be!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sarah is back and better than ever.
B0000027RL|1.0|I bought this album a while ago and it's crap. WHY DO pearl crap ALWAYS TRY TO COPY NIRVANA? I don't get it
B00005JMFR|4.0|Well, whether you hate it or love it, you have to hand it the Wach.. brothers for bringing us the Matrix Trilogy which raises the standard by which all sci-fi movies are now judged. Just like the 1st Star Wars spawned a generation of new movies, so too has/will Matrix. The audience will expect no less.<br />Although the original bordered on the metaphysical, the sequel 2 and 3 appeared to be more a mish mash of the same themes. It's like driving around the block looking for the right road, only to come back to where you started.<br />So what was Neo? Who was the Oracle? What was all this all about?<br />For myself, Neo was the only human able to confront the Matrix. Ironically instead of being the saviour being he is supposed to be, he's like a young child learning his first steps to walk, before he saves the world. The Oracle knew it all, but needed to set it all up in order to rid her nemesis Agent Smith. <br />The Moral Fibre? Beats me ... that's why only 4 stars. But still a must see for all it's CGI glory.
B0000E1WNV|4.0|You sometimes have to feel sorry for Bruce- for having such a devoted following, he rarely pleases the majority of his audience.  Part of that is the perhaps unfair standards to which he's held- even he can't be THAT good ALL of the time, and no recorded material could ever capture the glory of his live performances.  On the other hand, he does make strange choices with his products, especially with his archival releases:  B-sides to singles that contain previously released songs rather than unreleased cuts, discs of unreleased material like \\"Tracks\\" that contain empty space and leave off fan favorites, live albums that are edited and overdubbed and never contain an entire show, and his overall infrequent, excrutiatingly slow output.  Of particular frustration to many fans is the way he handles live material- when other artists like Pearl Jam, The Who, Peter Gabriel, Jimmy Buffett and of course The Dead are releasing \\"official bootlegs\\" of many or virtually all of their concerts, Bruce still refuses to release a complete show, much less a bunch of them.  His fans will go to great length to obtain inferior sounding bootlegs of the performances, yet Bruce oddly refuses to address the obvious demand.<br />So here we finally have a \\"complete\\" Bruce Springsteen concert.  It's on DVD, which is arguably even better than on CD (although I'd like both, since I rarely have time to rewatch a complete DVD but can always listen to music in the background).  This should be great news, and to an extent it is.  But once again, for a number of reasons, there's cause for us ungrateful fans to complain.  Here's why:  <br />1) Part of this show was already aired on CBS and European MTV- not a huge deal, but parts of it have been seen already.  It also repeats a few songs from his last DVD, making this one seem not quite as essential.<BR>2) It's been known for a while that Bruce filmed his later stadium shows.  There's some concern that THIS Barcelona release would cancel out the release of the later filmed shows, which have different (not necessarily better) setlists with material from Tunnel of Love, Human Touch and Lucky Town.  Releasing these later shows would address the problem of redundancy from his previous DVD.<BR>3. There's the already discussed problems with disc 2.  Mine works fine on a Toshiba DVD player, but apparently many people can't access the menus on Disc 2.  That's a manufacturing problem and shouldn't be attributed to Bruce, and this will certainly be addressed by Columbia.  Small comfort to those who can't view disc 2, I know, but at least no one should be stuck with these faulty discs.  <BR>4. This is MY main complaint:  the sound quality, while good, doesn't match that of many other concert DVDs, including Bruce's Live in NYC.  The sound is less crisp, the keyboards and drums sound muted and tinny, and, well, it just doesn't sound as good as a DVD should in 2003.  I really don't believe it's my system, because some concert DVDs are just mind-blowing in their sound quality.  Not this one.  <BR>5. The editing is jumpy and sometimes headache inducing.  There's too much focus on Bruce and not enough on the rest of the band.  This shouldn't be some hyper MTV video.  Sure, our focus is on Bruce, but part of the fun of seeing him in concert is focusing on the other members of the band, both playing the music and interacting with one another during and between songs.   <br />So those are the complaints.  But let's talk about the good stuff.  This IS a Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert.  That IS a good thing.  Even though the setlists later in the tour might have included more interesting rarities, you still get stuff like the piano Incident and Spirit, Night, as well as live renditions of The Rising material.  Bruce sitting solo at the piano is truly something unique and special, and you get two doses of it here.  Complaints about the setlist being \\"standard\\" aren't that valid anyway- I'm glad that Bruce didn't caterto the minority of fans who were \\"bored\\" with these songs after having seen dozens of shows on the tour.  This DVD gives a good document of what the majority of setlists were like throughout this tour, and it's not our problem that a few people burned themselves out on these songs by seeing too many shows.  Life's tough when your biggest complaint is that you saw too many Springsteen concerts and you're tired of the songs he performs regularly.  The majority of fans see one, two, maybe zero shows on a given tour, and this is a great remembrance if you were there or a close-to-being-there experience if you didn't make it to an actual concert.  That doesn't mean that I wouldn't like to see the Fenway and other stadium concerts- hopefully Bruce will follow the lead of the Stones and release a multi-DVD (and CD) set of the various concerts that ended this tour.  <br />So while it's great to have a full concert from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, you also can't help feeling that this, like his Essential CD, was a rather rushed job. Hopefully it's just a preview of bigger and better things to come...
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Madonna's influence on Ms. Spears is apparent as Britney takes chances with her music on her latest disc, \\"In The Zone\\", which qualifies as the funnest, danciest album to come out in 2003.  Leaving behind the power pop production of Max Martin, responsible for the biggest hits of her career (Baby One More Time, Oops! I Did It Again), Britney gets a little \\"messy\\" and continues the meshing of harder beats and styles that she introduced on her last disc \\"Britney\\" (I'm A Slave 4 U, Boys, Lonely).  <BR>The disc opens with the chaotically funky first single \\"Me Against The Music\\", which is already a club anthem and benefits from Madonna's cameo vocals.  For the rest of the disc, Britney dabbles in rough hip hop ((I Got That) Boom Boom), slinky soul (Showdown), reggae (The Hook Up), and trip hop (the Moby producd Early Mornin'), and Britney handles each confidently.  <BR>Britney's vocals have never been her strong point, and are tweaked and toyed with (most notably on \\"Brave New Girl\\"), but her delivery on the sensual \\"Breathe On Me\\", the bouncy \\"Toxic\\", and the closing ballad \\"Everytime\\", leave no doubt that she can carry a tune.<BR>Much has been made of the lyrical content, as Britney sings about being in her \\"trenchcoat and underwear\\" on the R. Kelly produced \\"Outrageous\\" or ... on \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", but then again, Ms. Spears is of age, and it's refreshing to see Britney address her maturing sensuality instead of still playing to the teen pop masses that have contributed to her success.  <BR>If there is a slight misstep on the disc, it would be \\"Shadow\\", a bland ballad produced by hitmakers The Matrix.  Simple lyrics and a lame chorus drag the track down, and actually brings the disc to a complete halt.  <BR>Overall, \\"In The Zone\\" is a fun, energetic listen as Britney continues to grow and stake her claim as a queen of pop music.
B000002J0G|5.0|This is one of Testament's best albums, if not the best.  In many ways, it is their comeback album.  Testament's most mediocre effort was SOULS OF BLACK, which did have some good songs on it, but SOULS was a disappointment to many fans, who felt the album sounded rushed. (Expectations were high after the release of Practice What You Preach.)  THE RITUAL was their progressive album.  However, LOW should have been the one to come after PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, instead of SOULS OF BLACK.<br />I like this album a lot and listening to it recently, I find it still has a wonderful sound.  The guitars are EXTREMELY heavy, the drums are loud, the bass is clear, and the vocals are brutal.  This album sounds very crisp, too, even though all of the instruments are played with utter intensity.  It has great production quality.<br />If you are a Testament fan, you need this album.  I always thought Chuck Billy did the best death metal roar when Testament was only using that for effect in the old days.  Here, it's used more often, but there's a nice balance between it and Chuck's normal style.  <br />This is heavy thrash at its best and not that nu-metal nonsense that is so common nowadays.  Buy this album if you like Testament.  If you only like PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH, then you are not a true Testament fan, even though PRACTICE is a great album.  I think LOW is much heavier, and a much better effort on Testament's part.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|The Spector-produced &quot;Let it Be&quot; is a solid album.  Far from the Beatles' best, it's a classic in it's own right.  Only a few tracks were really over-produced.  For my money, only &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; really suffered.<br />Anyway, for better or worse, that will always be the definitive version of &quot;Let It Be.&quot;  This new release should is a novelty, really.  Some of Spector's handiwork has been retained even (the edits of &quot;I Me Mine&quot; and &quot;Dig a Pony&quot;).  The sticker on the outside of the package, which says &quot;the band's cut,&quot; is laughable.  Outside producer's were hired to put this together, just as Spector was an outside producer.  At the risk of stating the painfully obvious, half the band is no longer with us.  The half that is still living didn't have anything to do with the production.  <br />I bought &quot;...Naked&quot; the day it was released, as I do with all Beatles releases.  But I have to say this was a poor idea.  We already had access to 'naked' versions of &quot;Long and Winding Rd,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; on the Anthology series.  This release was simply not neccessary and adds nearly nothing to the Beatles catalog.  <br />Why not the original &quot;Get Back&quot; album?  That has some historical significance, at least.  It could've been supplemented with the complete rooftop concert.  That's stuff that has been long available on bootlegs, but would be great to have as an official release.  As many fans know, there are hours upon hours of alternate takes, rehearsals, jamming, etc that was recorded during these sessions.  Why not a release containing some of that material?  <br />I know all the complaining in the world won't make any difference.  But it would be much more useful to remaster the original albums, a project long-overdue that seems like it may never happen.  This &quot;...Naked&quot; release won't sound incredibly different to casual fans.  There's a rooftop performance of &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; and alternate takes of a couple other numbers.  The whole cd sounds very good, but again, the remastering of the entire catalog (preserving the original mixes) would get that job done.<br />To add insult to injury, this release contains a &quot;bonus disc.&quot;  It's one track, about 22 minutes long.  As I mentioned before, there are HOURS of material from these sessions.  We're not all bootleg collectors, so I'm sure most people would be thrilled to get stuff like that.  So why did they decide to put only 20 minutes on the disc?  I honestly wouldn't complain if the 20 minutes was made up of actual performances of complete songs.  But instead, the 20 minutes is a montage of dialogue snippets and little bits of music, nothing running over a minute and most of it far shorter.  <br />The 2 star rating is based on the overall release, not the quality of the music.  I'd give it one star, due it being such a rip-off, but at the very least the cd contains a few alternate takes that make it valuable to completists.
B00004Z459|5.0|Now I do understand what the fuss about Linkin Park is all about, after i got this cd, it blew me away. It's the first time that i've heard this kind of music, it's a &quot;hybrid&quot; of rapping, rock and special effects all together to create a whole new melody. There are so many singles already in this single album, every song is capable of becoming a single.<br />Standout tracks on this record are &quot;Crawling&quot; &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; &quot;In The End&quot; and &quot;Forgotten&quot;. Chester, the vocalist really shares his feelings in his songs, the lyrics are so penetrating you can almost feel it. When they made this record, they didn't have an official bass player yet, and they still made it, obviously with just 5 talented musicians. Having bassist Dave Ferrel in the band later on didn't stop them from delivering their one-two punch music.<br />All in all, this is one must have album, go for it!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Someone else mentioned a general aversion to tribute concerts.  Beatles fans know there have been some pretty tacky tribute shows for John Lennon over the years.  But the Concert for George was a true exception, remarkable for the fact that all the participants were personal friends and collaborators of George.<br />I saw the movie in theaters and loved every minute of it, and now the complete show is available on dvd.  But I'm also very glad it has been released on cd.  There isn't a bad performance in the bunch, and they all come from the heart. <br />My personal favorites: all of disc one's Indian music from Ravi and Anoushka Shankar, McCartney's performances, Billy Preson singing &quot;Isn't it a Pity, Clapton's &quot;Beware of Darkness,&quot; and Joe Brown's show-closer &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams.&quot;<br />It would've been great if Bob Dylan had been involved, if only to join in on &quot;Handle With Care.&quot;  I have to imagine Dylan was invited to perform, but as great as it would've been, his absence is certainly not a detriment to this perfect tribute.
B000007T1M|5.0|In 1998, a remarkable band called System of a Down came onto the heavy music scene to give people something they hadn't heard before. Ignorantly dismissed as &quot;Armenian-Metal&quot; for where they are originally from, as they bring an interesting blend of metal to the masses. From the opening insanity of &quot;Suite-Pee&quot; to the slower, mellow to heavier almost ballad &quot;Spiders&quot; this CD took my breath away the first time I heard it back in '99 and still remains my favorite of theirs to date. Not just because of the fact that it's their heaviest and blah blah blah but every song on here in general is just awesome...period. I don't feel the need to skip any tracks or whatever. It seems they went to expand their audience with &quot;Toxicity&quot; and did make a great album, but it doesn't own as much as this masterpiece. Same thing with their B-Sides collection, &quot;Steal This Album!&quot;, which I actually like more than Toxicity, but that's just me. Most people that hear System either love them or hate them, which in most cases, is the way many bands should be, as far too many people like these guys for the sickingly catchy hit single &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; and it's a damn shame. *sigh* oh well...but the bottom line here is you either love em or hate em, and hopefully if you love em you have this cd in your collection, and if you're a new fan, definitely get this first, it's simply brilliant.
B0000DJZA0|3.0|I LOVE Coldplay!  But this isn't all that incredible.  The two new songs are great and might be worth the price of admission if you're a die hard fan.  Otherwise steer clear if you've got the two studio albums.  The LIVE versions are really no great shakes.  I remember when they came around on this tour and I DELIBERATELY didn't go because I KNEW they'd just repeat the stuff LIVE as is.  The ticket price was waaaaaay overblown and mostly because the show was at a corporate, elitist BS venue, but I wasn't paying it.  Not for Coldplay.  Not now.  This LIVE package proves my intuition correct.<br />They're going to get a LOT better as time goes on.  I can feel it.  They've got a lot of songwriting to do and they're a GREAT band!  The LIVE release is just a little too soon.  Let them develop fully with a back catalog to pull from before releasing this.  There are much more horrible purchases you can make, but I wouldn't put this at the top of my list.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|I have to be honest. When you are expect to hear something you have heard all your life and then have it mercilessly cut off, as was the coda to &quot;Get Back&quot;; it is very aggravating. In fact it annoys me so much that it really affects my enjoyment of the rest of the CD. I mean, why do that? Just to make it different so<BR>some schmuck like me will buy it, I guess. Okay, so trying to disregard the opening track how does the rest of the album stand up. The sound quality is superb. It is sharp and clear and I was able to pick up some guitar parts on &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; that was heretofore undiscernable. In fact, this song definitely benefited from the retread. But it remains one of my least favorite Beatles tunes as it is still McCartney shcmaltz even without the Phil Spector strings and overdubs. Leaving off Lennon throwaways like &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and replacing them with a classic like &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; only makes sense and should have been done on the original. But they used a different take from the version released on the single with &quot;Get Back&quot;. It just doesn't sound as visceral and gritty. The Harrisongs come off the best of the lot. They are great songs and sound like they were recorded yesterday. I also missed the whistling at the end of &quot;Two of US&quot; by Lennon. So to sum it up, &quot;Let It Be Naked&quot; lacks the intimacy of the original, and stand wearing a few extra garments on it's privates. It's great sound quality only makes one long desperately for the same treatment to be given to the rest of the Beatles catalogue without all the tinkering.
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|This movie is just great!! Far better than the original, and thats a rare thing! Collosus, Kitty, and other mutants appeared in this film, than the last. The first movie was cool, and this one even better. The plot was great, the graphics, with night crawler teleporting all over the place, that was just fantastic! I am only out of my seat waiting for the third movie of X-men to come out, marvel has done a great job. It is rated pg-13 but still, i would still recommend that kids to watch it. This movie is a must have, and when it comes out I will surely buy it.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Comparison of the key tracks:<br />Get Back - new version is cut off at the end. Oh, and it's not yet &quot;pure&quot;.  If we're going to remove everything except the four Beatles, then take out Preston's piano and see how good that sounds. Original is better.<br />Long &amp; Winding Road - new version has some lightweight solo in the middle.  Spector's backing orchestra added a lot.  Original is better.<br />Let It Be - new version removes a great distorted guitar solo and replaces it with a much poorer substitute.  Original is better.<br />Across the Universe - new version removes orchestra and highlights John's nasally voice. Orginal is better.<br />I think Spector knew what he was doing.  2-stars.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|This is her best album yet to date.  It is so well rounded and her voice has never sounded better!  anyone who is a fan of hers will absolutely rave about this album!  Drifting, Answer, Time, Perfect Girl, and Dirty Litlle Secret are some of the best on this album.
B000002UAO|2.0|I advise music fans just discovering the Beatles to focus on the early albums (up to A Hard Day's Night) and the last albums (Abbey Road and Let It Be).  The middle albums are not as good, especially Revolver and Rubber Soul.
B00008PW2E|5.0|PLEEEEEEASE RELEASE THE DVD BOX SET ALREADY!!! I WAS GONE IN IRAQ FOR 8 MONTHS AND MISSED THE ENTIRE SEASON!  THIS AND THE SOPRANOS ARE THE ONLY TWO THINGS I WATCH!!!
B000001EEN|5.0|Just so you know where I am coming from, Neil Young is my favorite guitarist, songwriter, and rock performer.  Clapton taps into Neil's viceral aproach of guitar playing at this concert and blows the listener away with scorching versions of  every song on this CD.  Absent is his dispassionate corporate approach to post 1975 Clapton perforamances.  I think it has something to do with playing a Les Paul instead of the squeaky and puny sounding Strats he now favors.  Mostly though, I think Clapton was still emotionally invested in the music and let it rip at this show.  I think Clapton actually enjoyed playing these songs on that night in 1973.<br />You couldn't pay me to see Clapton play today for the corporate crowd in their luxury suites.<br />Think you know what Clapton is all about? Listen to this!  <br />One of the most underated rock albums of all time on an excellent sounding re-issue at a bargain price.  It rocks!   Warning:  Don't listen to The Rainbow Concert if you prefer wimpy, overly produced, perfectly played music.
B00006JDS4|1.0|it wasnt that bad of a movie. not to say it was a great movie either. and lets be honest noone would even be interested in it if it werent controversy. i know thats the reason i watched it, was to see what all the hype was about. its an okay movie. i dont think it deserves to be considered a disgrace to the film industry. and it isnt some great symbolic movie either. just take it for what it is. zombie trash.
0060931671|5.0|Although I could go on about this book until your ears bled. I just wanted to let sdfsdf (whose review graces the first page of this entry) know that he really oughtn't try so hard. So you are (or want to be) a logophile. Congratulations! But you, unlike Pynchon, scarcely warrant the reading of your review, much less looking up your impressive-looking (but lousily contextualized, and oft-misused) words. If the literati were more along the lines of the illuminati, you'd have been cut long ago. (It's nothing personal. It's just that I trip over people like you every day, where I'm at, and I'm pretty tired of having barked shins.)
B00004X0Q0|5.0|If there was one band who deserved the title as &quot;hardest working band in rock&quot;, it would have been really hard not to consider ATDI. After years of constant touring they delivered this, their first major label release, Relationship of Command. The Ross Robinson produced debut jumps all the barriers, creates a sound all their own, and live up to every expectation that had been established. The sound of ATDI is very unique and therefore comparisons aren't easily made. The closest sound would be the works of Rage Against The Machine which contains the same rampant energy and spastic vocals that makes ATDI so exciting. However though, don't stick this in with any preconceived expectations other than that you are going to be blown away.<br />The band can most easily be identified by Cedric Bixler's soaring vocals which erupt through each track with a hyperactive level of energy that makes it virtually impossible to listen to ATDI and hold still at the same time. His frantic melodies are addicting and memorable and will infest your mind for days after each listen, even though the bulk of the time it's entirely futile to attempt to decipher exactly what it is he is talking about.<br />Sonically, the rest of the band is just as energetic as Cedric with intense punk guitar riffs, furious drumming, and tripped out sound effects. All of which combine to create a sounscape that is both fast and abrasive while maintaining a strong structure.<br />Songs such as Arc Arsenal, Pattern Against User, One Armed Scissor, and Enfilade are the best examples of the chaos that is ATDI, but how somehow they still manage to create absolutely infectuous hooks and melodies that implant themselves in your head.<br />ATDI has earned nearly all of their fans through constant touring so it was essential that this album captured the intensity and chaotic feel of their live shows. With Relationship of Command they have done just that, creating what is sure to be a classic album in the library of anyone interested in the underground scene. It's a true crime that they broke up after such an amazing release, but atleast they went on to create impressive next acts in the Mars Volta (highly experimental and brilliant) and Sparta (less impressive but good non-the-less).
B000002H97|1.0|Its basically come to this .. a band that was setting standards with metal innovation have fallen behind creatively - and they get rewarded with insane commercial success. So here you have dumb riffs that dont develop and weak songs from start to finish. Put that together with a super-glossy sounding production package and you have the biggest disappointment in music history. This album was created for one reason and one reason alone - sales. If Metallica had retained their integrity, they would have made a real metal album  - not this crap.
B00006AFUR|5.0|This was probably the biggest suprise of the entire year. Skepticism arose around this band from the beginning with actor Jared Leto (Fight Club, Panic Room) as the band's frontman. However, after several minutes of listening it becomes quickly apparent that Leto is the element that takes the band to levels of greatness that no one expected them to reach. Leto can truly sing, and he does so with absolutely every fathomable fraction of his ability throughout the entire album. His vocals are beautiful, touching, and very emotionally moving. Without displaying a single element of screams or growls, he sings with a passion that is missing from much of todays mainstream. Intensely unexpected yet extremely welcomed.<br />The music itself stands out by leaps and bounds from the rest of the music we hear today. Combining elements of Stabbing Westward, Depeche Mode, and their own touch of spaced-out electronics, 30STM have created a new sound that is all their own and that is instantly appealing. Heavy guitars are consistent throughout the bulk of the album, yet are so complimented by the array of dance/techno/space samples that they are far from the focus. Rather they are simply an element of what is a brilliant whole, a dynamic sound unlike anything else out there today.<br />30 Seconds To Mars have done what no one expected them to do. They have created a masterpeice with their debut and smashed their way right up to the elite of the rock regime. One of the best albums of the year if not for it's originality, simply because of it's dynamic emotional intensity.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This release sort of answers a few \\"what ifs\\" that people have been asking for years now, but for me raises even more questions. The actual release itself is very good, and is a fine, fine listen. It's been said for many years that 'Let It Be' was the weak leak of The Beatles catalogue, but I guess these people had never heard the 'Beatles For Sale' album and forgot all about 'Wild Honey Pie.' 'Let It Be' is a very good album for what it is, and has a wealth of good material, but it does have a few weaker songs. 'Get Back' and the title track are two of the finest of the group's hits, 'Dig A Pony' is a great Lennon rocker, and 'Across The Universe' is a beautiful, Lennon-penned song.   This 'Naked' release is supposed to be what was actually intended by the group, but half of the group is dead. A lot of things on this new version sound fantastic, and a lot of things aren't worth praising at all. 'Across The Universe' is the track that was most affected by Phil Spector's production, and this release improves the album production. The problem with that song wasn't the orchestral arrangement, it was that he slowed the tape down so much that it sounded swirly and out of tune (the original song is in D, but the Spectorized version sounds almost in C#). 'The Long And Winding Road' isn't necessarily better or worse (I actually like the Spector-produced one), but it's more what McCartney wanted and definitely has a more intimate feeling. On the negative side, what [...] happened to 'Get Back'? The producers here chopped off about thirty seconds at the end, and it just seems to cut off. A lot of the songs seem to fade out prematurely and go right into the next track instantaneously. Also, weren't there other songs recorded during these sessions? The \\"Fly On the Wall\\" disc is somewhat amusing to hear the banter during rehersals, but why not put actual music on the second disc?  The biggest question that this project raises is that there is a wealth of unreleased material fromthese sessions collecting dust somewhere in England, and why won't that ever be officially released? The rooftop concert has been circulating in bootleg circles for thirty-four years now (I even have a copy of it), and there are two other versions of the 'Get Back' album, one mixed by Glyn Johns, and one by George Martin. Also, there is supposedly a 5-minute jam of 'Dig It' circulating, which I myself have never heard. This album is barely 35 minutes long, and could use some more material, why not have that as a bonus track? Another big question is that there is a ton of technology that can be used to remaster the original Beatles albums, but us listeners still have to settle for those ancient cd issues from back in the day.  This release should not really be a substitute for the original release, but it's a good companion and has some improvements and some problems. The main problem isn't with what's on this disc, but it's with what's not on it. This isn't an absolute necessity for all Beatles fans, but for people who thought the original album was marred by overproduction, this might be a more satisfying release. Both versions of the album are pretty good, infact.
B00005ATQ9|2.0|This film is a biography in the most straightforward sense: It simply recounts the events of this historical person's extrordinary life. Kubrick's goal, one supposes, was to bring this character to life, for us to bear witness to his troubled heart. Unfortunately, by focusing his efforts on the period sets and costumes, he misses the mark, and leaves us struggling to truly connect with or understand who Redmond Barry really was or how any of his myriad life-decisions were made. I suppose all those details were lost to the filter of History, and Kubrick does not exert his license to flesh out his historical protagonist with human characteristics. Redmond Barry's life involved many dramatic changes of circumstance and character, perhaps too many for even for a 3-hour movie to pull off convincingly. Also, contrary to other reviewers, I felt that casting all-American pretty boy Ryan O'Neal as the Irish-commoner-turned-English-nobleman was a poor choice. In other words, it's not all Kubrick's fault that we can't relate to the protagonist. Beautifully filmed eye-candy, but missing the emotional hook.

This DVD is a must have if you are a fan of Shania's, or even if you are just a fan of good music! She shows so much crowd energy, and she never wears down. She starts each song off, just like it was the first, with the same enthusiasm and drive! I am so glad I bought this DVD the day of its release, it is oh so worth the money!
B00000IQC8|5.0|I really liked this movie.  It is such a real look into the world of retail.  As a Conveniance store clerk myself, I understand how bad that job can be (especially when you have to work on your day off). This movie is funny especially when you have had days like that.  I think for such a small budget (his budget was only 28,000 for EVERYTHING) Kevin Smit did an incredible job.  there is no reason that this film should not be liked by everyone who sees it.
0451196716|5.0|This book blew me away the 1st time i picked it up The story starts somewhere in the future where every year 100 teenage boys are picked to walk (not run) a marathon and if you go below 4 miles more then 4 times you get shot now this might seem a bit lame but not at all what i believe, makes this novel so great is the characters they all have different and unique personalities and they all have stories that they tell to there new found friends which are interesting and actually make you think. Halfway through this novel you will have your favorite walker. If you are a person who enjoys a novel with a creepy setting and an emotinal characters you will love this.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Pre-packaged Hollywood garbage. Welcome to Britneys world. Another album attempting to make her a respected music artist. To bad she is just a HACK. Hopefully her pre-teen fans will grow up and begin to appreciate real music and musicians.

B0000CFW87|5.0|How in the world did Josh and David come up with a better collection of music than the first time around? I sit at my desk with headphones on and have to avoid the looks of co-workers as tears continually fill my eyes. Is the music sad? No ... simply so beautiful that it almost hurts. Now I could kick myself for not getting the version with two more tracks ......
B0000DD7LB|1.0|The first single with leather faced Madonna failed.  This CD is pure garbage.  It will not even appeal to the low IQed masses.
B00005JM0B|5.0|You wonder, why did they make a T3?  Did Arnold really need the money?<br />Things could have been awful.  You have a 58-year old man playing the exact same character he played nearly 20 years ago.  The absence of James Cameron could have really destroyed this movie.<br />However, the cast is excellent.  Arnold was in excellent shape for this movie, and he definitely was born to play the T-101.  Nick Stahl does a fantastic job as the new John Connor, and Claire Danes is solid as usual.  The T-X is perfect as well, played by Kristanna Lokken.  The movie ends the only way it really could end, yet it is somewhat surprising.  The special effects are spectacular, the sound mix is incredible, and the transfer is perfect.  This is one of those DVD's you should use to show off your system.<br />I highly recommend T3.
0345440900|5.0|I'm a 1st time mom with NO experience with babies and truely had no \\"instinct\\" all these other perfect mothers talk about. The first 2 months with my preemie daughter I was anxious all the time and very disorganized because I didn't have a schedule (it was difficult for me to even take her to the grocery store because I had no idea when she would be sleepy, hungry, etc). <br />I read Baby Wise, but was not willing to let my baby \\"cry it out\\". It was too harsh for me so I didn't even give the schedule a try (until later).<br />I read No-Cry Sleep Solution, but found it excrutiatingly redundant. However, it might be a great source for someone with a toddler who is still not sleeping through the night.<br />Then I read Baby Whisperer, it gave me the info I needed to gain the confidence I had been lacking. Hogg gave detailed lists of physical signs that show differences between tiredness, hunger, over-stimulation, etc. She helped me breast feed better, properly burp, and bathe baby. To an experienced mother this may sound elementary, but it wasn't to me or my own mother and mother-in-law (whom with 4 kids between them couldn't figure out when a baby was over stimulated and not hungry).  Hogg also taught me how to respect my baby and how to get  her to sleep all night long!!!  By 4 mos of age my preemie was in the 85% for weight , my grocery shopping got done, I knew when playtime was, when naptime was.<br />I got so much from this book, I was shocked to read negative remarks about it. I do disagree with Hogg about the bouncer and the swing issue, but she promotes the reader doing what's right for themselves. I also went back to BabyWise book for an actual sample of a schedule since Hogg's book didn't include one (she should've for people like me).
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Every time Sarah puts out a classic album I wonder how the heck she can ever hope to follow it. Yet every time, she does. Stylistically, Afterglow differs only slightly from her previous albums, yet it is distinct and original, and unmistakably Sarah.<br />While this a whole album of great songs, I latched onto certain pieces first time through - Fallen, Stupid, Train Wreck, Push and Time above all. On subsequent listenings, the rest of the songs also came on board.<br />Great songs, great cover and photos. Has she ever looked more beautiful? I sincerely doubt it.<br />In an industry full of posers and gimmick bands, this is yet another breath of fresh air from the queen herself.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I am looking for the original godfather on DVD but this seems to be the only one right now.....what 5 dvds come in this collection?? email me at KRissy6951@aol.com. Thanks!!!
B0000E1WKE|3.0|This is a good (average) Christmas cd by Whitney Houston. But something tells me had she did this cd 10 years ago, it would have been much better than this one. Don't get me wrong, this cd is a hella lot better than her last nightmare called &quot;Just Whitney&quot;. But I feel something is lacking with this one. I really loved the song she did with her baby Bobbi Christina. That is a nice song. I hope this is a sign that Whitney is getting better...Let me also recommend Mariah Carey's classic &quot;Merry Christmas&quot;, Vanessa William's beautiful &quot;Star Bright&quot; and Whitney's last great cd &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot; soundtrack. But get Whitney's &quot;One Wish: The Holiday Album&quot;, too.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is so great. This is the best of Britney did. This album is so great..I say juste wow!!
B0000TB03W|2.0|...you have seen it all. Shania has not grown as a recording artist and she has not grown as a live performer, either. Basically, she is doing the samething she did during her 98-99 tour. The only thing different is her outfits (which are uglier) and she added some new songs (from her UP! album). But other than that, nothing is different...nothing improved...nothing changed. I will give her credit for her energy and she sounds pretty good. But I expect an artist of her level to give me more (especially after selling 30 million off her last cd and taking a long vacation). This show was a BIG bore. Buy the Dixie Chicks's Top of the World dvd and cd instead.
B000089RVR|5.0|There's just something about Dido.  Her voice isn't amazing.  The songs, at face value, aren't much.  But the combination of her voice and the music turn into something that just gets under your skin and haunts your inner brain.  At first, &quot;White Flag&quot; was all that appealed to me on the record.  Then, &quot;Mary in India&quot; crept into my brain.  Now I'm hearing, &quot;Who Makes You Feel.&quot;  This is definitely an album that you can play on a rainy Sunday morning and listen to over, and over, and over again.  And you can also play it on a steamy Friday night.  Give it some time and it will get under your skin.
B00002N9ER|4.0|This is a great addition to the Maglight flashlight, you can mount it in your car &amp; always have your flashlight handy. The overall construction quality is good but will break if not used with some degree of care. I have had (1) clip break out of 4 pairs in three years. I highly recommend these mounting clips for convenience &amp; just wish they were made a little bit more heavy duty.
B00005RHGK|4.0|I have seen this recently, and have to say this is a great film.  Some parts are predictable like ending up down the drain pipe and a &quot;red herring&quot; camper, but some parts are not, like the ending is a good example.  Also makes you realize women should not drive stick shifts vehicles with a clutch(just kidding).  The only reason this did not get five stars is the line the guy fed to the woman to go back and see if it was a body in the drainpipe.  There should have been a better reason to go back, or totally take out that part of the framework/film, and just drive back.  A must see film.  You will not be disapointed if you enjoy dark films.  Will remind you of an older movie called &quot;Gargoyles&quot; from the 70s, but is better in my opnion.
B0000CDL93|5.0|sure, he's taken real life events and fictionalzied some characters and there alleged involvement with the assisination. most directors have creative license to make a movie that is more compelling to its audience. so the scripted words in JFK are not historically accurate. <br />what Mr. Stone manages to do is make swiss cheese out of the Warren Commission report. after viewing this movie, it appears to me that this report is the biggest work of &quot;non-fictionalized&quot; fiction ever written. many questions are posed that are not easliy answered. IMO the report isn't worth the paper it's printed on, with the exception of buttwipe.  <br />this movie really is a remarkable achievement. kudos to OS for not scrapping the project after the original JFK script was stolen during filming/production....
B000002AP1|5.0|my god, this is an amazing album, this is a highly underratted band, I dont care what anyone says about iggy and the stooges, i have been a fan of iggy since the early 90's (94-95) and Funhouse and i had a Funhouse record...i listened to it, and i absolutely loved thier intensity, but Raw Power has to be 2nd after Funhouse, their new guitarist in this album did much good for this band, the original guitarist was good, but this guy was better, i highly reccomend this album if your into finding out the high influences of punk attitude and punk music....great great cd...enough said
B0000DD7LB|1.0|By far the worst so far. Guess she is really running out of ideas and trying her hardest to keep afloat. I don't see her being around much longer! She is just played out and looks can only take you so far when you are lacking in the talent department.
0441172717|5.0|This is the true mastery of the humans imagination, far surpassing such inferior works as Lord of the Rings.  No, there is nothing good about LOTR, it's just an over-detailed piece of crap people pretend to understand because they think it makes them look smarter.
B000089RVR|5.0|&quot;THANK YOU&quot; DIDO FOR YET ANOTHER GREAT CD.  YOUR WORK WITH FAITHLESS IS AMAZING, BUT YOUR SOLO WORK IS BRILLIANT.  IT'S HARD THESE DAYS TO FIND A CD WHERE THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 GOOD SONGS ON IT.  MONEY WELL SPENT!  NOW JUST DON'T TAKE SO LONG PUTTING OUT ANOTHER CD!
B00005JLRT|4.0|but when it finally hits you it's like Wrath of Kahn with better acting, and special effects.  The early scenes were annoyingly untouching though, and some of the deleted scenes should certainly have stayed in.  There was also a deleted scene I read about in an interview with Brent Spiner where Data was teaching his &quot;brother&quot; table manners, that should have been included.
0807219908|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical when a friend of mine brought me the audio cd for this book. Seeing as both of us are college graduates I felt that reading a book intended for 10 to 12-year-old kids might not be our cup of tea. But listening to Tim Curry's fantastic narration of the first chapter kept us captivated enough to go through the entire first book. The brilliance of the story telling lies mainly in the fact that it can be understood at different levels. For the kids there's the plane good vs evil idea of the mean villain trying to steal the money. From an adult point of view there's the very disturbing gruesome sexual undertone which makes the read a very disturbing one. But scattered throughout the book are the very funny/sarcastic observations that lighten the mood and keep you laughing hard at even the darkest points. Being a huge Terry Pratchett fan I find some of Terry's sense of humour and social observation in this book, even if no one that reviews this seems to agree with me on this. I doubt that I'll be committed enough to read all 13 books in the series but this one was a fantastic entertainment for a relaxing Sunday. Tim Curry's simply one of the best readers imaginable and the audio cd is a true masterpiece.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|On her last CD, Britney struggled with not being a girl and not yet a woman, on 'In the Zone,' she makes it clear that she's a woman and nothing in between. She's not looking back. Though, the album may not be as personal as Christina's &quot;Stripped,&quot; it's still a worthy CD and a step away from teen pop. Britney masterfully works Rap, R n B, Reggae, etc. Here's what I think about the whole CD:<BR>1.) Me Against the Music- 4/5 I like this song a lot. It's a good song to listen to when you're in the car.<BR>2.) I Got that (Boom Boom)-5/5 This is my favorite song on the whole CD. I was surprised to hear that the Ying Yang Twins are on this because I would have never guessed she would collaborate with them.<BR>3.) Showdown-4/5 Another one of my favorites.<BR>4.) Breathe on Me-3/5 This song kind of reminds me of the songs Madonna put out on &quot;Erotica.&quot; It's not bad but it's not great either.<BR>5.) Early Mornin-3/5 It took me a while to like this song. It's different, maybe that's why.<BR>6.) Toxic-4/5 This song reminds me of Linkin Park's &quot;Numb,&quot; with the strings and all. It's pretty good but after a while it gives u a headache with all the beats and stuff, but a good headache. <BR>7.) Outrageous-2/5 It's pretty much the weakest song on the album. Thats all I can say.<BR>8.) Touch of My Hand-3/5 A song about..u know what. Aside from being controversial, it's okay.<BR>9.) The Hook Up-4/5 This is the reggae song on the album and it is a really good song to hum along to. It got stuck in my head for days! <BR>10.) Shadow-3.5/5 I never really understood the lyrics to this song but it sounds like one of her older ballads, which is not a bad thing.<BR>11.) Brave New Girl-5/5 THE BEST SONG ON THIS CD! Britney tries her hand at rap, and I have to say it's good. It's a really catchy song. Very good.<BR>12.) Everytime-4/5 A sweet good ballad. Not different from her many ballads, but it's nice.<BR>13.) Me Against the Music Remix-4/5 It's a great remix anda good club song.<BR>BUY THIS CD~!
0385504209|1.0|The research for this book is terrible - it is all based on total rubbish so far as any understanding of Christianity is concerned. No historian, whether atheist, Catholic or Protestant, or simply agnostic, would give this book the time of day so far as factual research is concerned. Yes, if you want a science fiction thriller, like Raiders of the Lost Ark, this kind of nonesense is fine, but don't believe a word of it as fact
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is a great album.  I love every dream theater album, and most require you to be musician/dream theater fan to really appreciate it. However I think this will be more popular among the people that don't fit this category. This is way better than anything out there right now. Damn near everything out there sounds the same. AND nothing has a guitar solo anymore, let alone any kind of lead guitar, nice drum beats, etc. Everything out there is just a couple riffs, verses, and choruses. Nothing has the diversity and trasnition that are in these songs.  Most musicians out there in todays popular bands do not play nearly as well these guys.   My best suggestion is that you see these guys live, nothing compares.<br />A lot of this ablum has the sound that Metallic should have had that not created that piece of trash St Anger.
B00005JMFO|1.0|For starters, and we were shocked at the unnecessary nudity.  The lack of completion with the stories. We wanted to see this film because we like Alan Rickman.  It was billed as a \\"funny, romantic comedy\\".  It was anything but...Alan Rickman plays a married man who is tempted by his secretary to \\"cheat mentally\\" or at least to give her a Christmas necklace...this story ends with Rickman and Thompson (his wife) staying together \\"for the children's sake\\"?  Who knows?  The story line is never finished...and that was the best of the stories in this film!<br />What a disappointment!  Would give it a \\"no star\\" rating if possible, but the lowest rating is a one star.
B00005JMFO|5.0|I started to smile during the opening credits, which are real, heart-tugging holiday reunions at Heathrow Airport, and I never stopped until the very LAST credits, more of the same.<br />If you love your Brits, like I do, and in particular, if the Brits you love include the likes of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, and a host of others, as they say, then you will be in UK heaven. Hugh Grant plays, of all things, the newly elected British Prime Minister, a bachelor who secretly wonders whether he can really do the job. But the plot goes well beyond Number Ten...to a hodgepoge of different people, young and old, who are grappling with love in all its forms.<br />We have two young and innocent porn stars (a hilarious thought in itself) who shyly fall in love while nudely achieving the most unabandoned coupling in front of cameras and film crew. There is a mystery writer who suddenly finds himself alone at Christmas, and escapes to Portugal only to fall in love with his gorgeous young housekeeper--who speaks not a word of English. There is the recent widower (played poignantly by Liam Neeson) who must help his 10-year-old stepson through his own agonizing love affair and the loss of his mum...and so on and so on and so on...until the movie reaches its star comic turn: Bill Nighy as a washed-up, drugged-up, almost brain-dead former pop idol whose horrible remake of an old hit (\\"Love Is All Around You\\") hits the airwaves just in time for Christmas.<br />As the old goat makes the rounds of the talk shows and pop TV venues, he speaks his mind--and then some. Truly a star turn for Nighy, who is absolutely hilarious.<br />OK, you might gather I loved this movie. And so I did. If it was the old days, where you paid for your ticket and had the right to sit in the theater all day long, I would have done so. I don't think I can wait another week before seeing it again. Just right for the holidays--enjoy!!
B000002U6E|5.0|What can you say about a cd like this?  Everything that could possibly be said has already been said. Its just that good.<BR>Judging by all of the reviews (which I was glad to see that they were highly rated) anyone who was unsure about what the music consisted of should know by now.  I do not think I need to recover a topic that has already been covered so much.  But I will go a bit into a subtopic of that.<BR>I have seen a few reviews here and there on the various Enigma cds (including this one) that have been negative towards the sound of Michael Cretu's voice.  With the release of each new cd, Cretu has sung more and more on his tracks.  In MCMXC a.D. the only track he really sings in is The Rivers of Belief (from what I can recall).  By the time you get to Voyageur, his voice, in some form, is in about every song.<BR>For those of you who like his voice, this is great.  But for those of you who despise his voice, this will almost surely destroy your listening &quot;experience.&quot;<BR>His voice is rather hard to describe.  He has a somewhat raspy voice and at times a fairly heavy German accent.  Yet, there is still a somewhat of a smoothness to his voice along with the raspiness. <BR>For the most part, I do not notice his accent too much, but I can really pick up on it in the song &quot;Out From the Deep.&quot;  That's not a bad thing, as long as you like his voice.<BR>Personally I am in love with his voice.  It reminds me Phil Colins or Peter Gabrial (not as good, but getting close to it).  He just has a voice you either love or hate. This would be the only warning about this cd.<BR>I personally think everyone should own this cd, or a cd that is something like this.  It is so relaxing.  It puts you into a good state of mind and is good to play at night for you insomniacs.  Unless you are very against new age music (which is basically what this cd is) you should buy it, no doubt about it.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This album is a piece of art which compares in heaviness to Images and Words with the melody of SFaM.  I have followed this band for a decade now and have found this is the only true REAL Prog rock band left.  Labrie's voice had a total makeover and is just perfect on this album, the chorus's are melodic and addictive, with an amazing instrumental (stream of cosciousness)that just grooves......This is truley on of their best and gets back to thier roots.  great job DT! love ya!
B0000DJZB9|4.0|Hi there, GN'R is my all tyme favorite, because of these guys I became a musician, everything they do is breathtaking. But the makers of this DVD didn't care about the sound quality at all. Use your Illusion tour DVDs also. I bought all of them a week ago. I had them on VCD and VHS, but I hoped DVD will be more good sounding and stuff. but it was a dissapointment for me. Why they can't make a production like those of Van Halen and Poison, their DVDs sound excellent. Why GN'R doesn't deserve it, why? I don't care for money I paid, but these DVDs could have been better.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|&quot;Once Upon A Time In The West&quot; is one of the most well made movies of the western genre.  The sweeping old west landscapes look truly amazing on the DVD's widescreen anamorphic format,  its hard to believe that this movie was made 35 years ago.  The plot is brilliantly developed in a typical Sergio Leone, visually narrated, story-telling style.  The music is wonderful and compliments the theme perfectly.  This is not a typical shoot em' up, good guy vs. bad guy western.  There are great performances all around, especially by Charles Bronson, Henry Fonda and Claudia Cardinale.<br />A must see for all Western movie fans!
B0000035E7|3.0|I highly enjoy enjoy this album from 'Nirvana'. This was their first album, and to be honest, I actually enjoy it more than their subsequent, more successful albums 'Nevermind' and 'In Utero', it's more 'reckless fun' I suppose. This is powerful riff-driven rock with plenty of energy. Kurt delivers the vocals with plenty of power and 'gusto'.    As far as styles go, I don't really think that trying to categorise the band should be done; simply, they have so many styles incorporated into their sound, for example the chorus to 'Floyd the Barber' is kind of Beatles, Love Buzz is kind of rocked up 60's pop, 'Negative Creep' feels like a parody on glam-rock, with typical lyrics about girls on borderline legal age and being stoned. Then sifting is a dark power-ballad. The chorus to 'Big Cheese' actually sounds a bit similar to a 60's pop song 'Black is black'. Then the dark 'Paper Cuts' is almost avant-garde. Most of the other songs are a mix of alternative/punk, arena rock, garage rock and probably other styles.     As for Chad Channing, I don't have a problem with his drumming, sounds pretty good at the start of Scoff. The one thing I don't like about this release (and generally about Nirvana) is that it is sometimes hard to understand all the lyrics. This album never came with a lyrics sheet, and if you go to various lyrics web sites they often have different interpretations, simply because sometimes it's (very) hard to understand what is being said. For this reason I couldn't bring myself to hand out a 4 stars. Also, I've never liked 'Downer' (which also appeared on 'Incesticide'), it's so rushed, it's like singing 10 words in one syllable. I also never really liked 'Sifting', kind of drags on, but the rest of the songs I dig.     I think the best songs are 'Floyd the Barber', which mixes heavy verses with a Beatlesque chorus, and a great lyric about school bullying, 'About a girl', and songs like 'Big Cheese', 'Scoff' and 'Mr. Moustache' in the second half of the album that are fun. 3 stars ***
B0000CFW87|5.0|I bought this CD in the music store at the mall, and let me tell you I truly love this CD, Josh's voice just carry you thru so many different moods, he is one of the best singers I have heard in a long time since Neil Diamond.  Josh Groban surpasses all other singers.  The first time I had heard him, I just fell in love with him, he is the ultimate.  I listen to his Cd over, and over, and over again.  I never tire of his voice.  To me he even out surpasses the 3 Tenors.  When you hear this CD you will melt, I don't care if you're a male or female you will just melt with warmth.  I hope he does an album in Hebrew, and Arabic my two favorite languages next to Italian, Spanish, and French of which he sings.  You will not have one favorite song of his but all his songs will be your favorite.  He's got my vote on being one of the hottest songster on the scene...  You will not be disappointed...
B002X1MUXY|3.0|So, the best rock band of the 90's (well, one of the most popular anyway) had another album in the vault for the fans? A varied and sometimes eccentric collection of alt-metal that has more influences than there are illnesses in 'Mexican Seafood' (no offense to the fish caught off the coast of mexico).     I'd vouch a four or more star review at this album, an excellent slog of heart-on-sleeve recitals of child nightmares, yet the chaos never gets in the way of good melodies. Well, it'd be worth more if it weren't so terribly hard to understand what Kurt Cobain is saying. Some of the songs have such poor clarity of pronunciation, such as 'Hairspray Queen', which is actually a great song. And no, this doesn't come with a big nice shiny lyrics sheet. And isn't a lyrics sheet a cover for a lack of ability to mesh your vocals with the music, or, for that matter, poor singing?     Kobain and Co are versatile, going all over the place with style, and what's the point of categorising things? Let's say it's a cross between Grunge, Anti-Grune, Metal and Anti-Metal, if that's what Alternative means? I just know when it's catchy, it's CATCHY, such as Son of a Gun, Molly's lips, Dive, Sliver. When it's devastating, it's some of the most eerie piece of demented 'I had a REALLY bad childhood' shtick ever (try hearing Mexican Seafood, Hairspray Queen and Aero Zeppelin in a row without feeling some nervous impulse, like chewing your fingernails!) Rating ***1/4 (3.25)

B0000DJZ7W|5.0|I am afraid to buy this album and i asked the sales girl if i could listen to it before i purchase it and i did. I listen to the first song and i knew i would buy this cd home. I am a Chinese and knew nothing about French but i just listen to it over and over again in my cd player and the voice is amazing and the music feels a little like while you are on the highway and this feels like a country cd. But the voice is good and the first 5 songs ae amazing but the rest are just so-so.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this lp is good i really mean that im really not into chart music i only like underground but this is so good shes the only singer from the charts i listen to BUY THIS ALBUM PLZ YOU WILL REALLY LIKE OH 1 MORE THING BRITNEY WILL YOU MARRY ME
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This is one of Dream Theaters best albums by far. It is  heavily moody and dark, without having any corny slow songs as some of DT's other albums have. Every song is great(no filler here!). It is a huge improvement over Six Degrees, which I still don't really care for too much. James Labrie is at his least annoying on this album and he sounds really good with the much heavier music backing him up. John Petrucci seems to be going more for speed than melody on his solos, but this guy rocks as usual. His riffs are thick and meaty, loaded with texture and brute force. Mike Portnoy is a drumming machine as always, and John Myung has some great bass parts as well. The only band member kind of left out is Jordan, but he fills in the needed spots well. Along with Images and Words, this is my favorite DT album. I saw them live once in March 2002, and I hope to see them in concert again soon. Dream Theater is back and ready to rule to metal world!!!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|rented this dvd from my favorite rental shop.<br />thought i would find it interesting being a life long beatles fan but some of these tribute shows can be a bit dicey so i put it in very casually.<br />two hours later, i felt someone had to climb up to drag me down from the cloud i was floating on.<br />beginning with some heartfelt comments by george's friends eric clapton and ravi shankar and with the presense of george's wife nearby, the packed royal albert hall in london witnessed a once in a lifetime tribute to one of the music worlds treasured spirits and guiding lights.<br />like others, my initial reaction to the opening of the show-a full Indian orchestra, was something i imagined i would be skipping over without much arm twisting.<br />but i began to watch and was mesmerized with the musianship of all the musicians and singers led by the virtuoso performing of ravi shankar's daughter playing her sitar and later, conducting the orchestra.<br />this first indian section of the concert lasts quite a while bringing to a close with mr. clapton and his acoustic guitar adding to the mood.<br />i was thouroughly wrapped up in the indian music like i never thought i could be. it was the first time i had ever sat through an entire indian piece not wanting to skip it.<br />it was the influence of george from on-high yet, as mr. shankar put it , with us in the room this night, that held me rapt during the music george came to love.<br />jeff lynn came out during the indian portion and sang and played guitar to george's inner light. what a treat.<br />after an intermission, the 'western' music began.<br />to a beatles fan and fan of george harrison's music, i was not nearly disappointed. on the contrary, i was in awe at how excellent every rendition of a harrison song was executed.<br />each chestnut was treated as an unearthed gem and polished with fine care by all the performers.<br />i must comment as others have at the joy it was to watch george's son on stage.  dhani is the spitting image of his father as he was when a young man. it was uncanny to watch.<br />one reviewer suggested that ringo singing honey don't did not really fit in to the program and was corrected by another reviewer that carl perkins was in fact a large inspiration to george and therefore very fitting.<br />i interject another case of did it fit however and that would be the song performed by jools holland and sung by (a very foxy looking) sam browne called HORSE TO THE WATER. now, what this has to do with george harrison-i'll be happy to be enlightened.<br />thank you.<br />a beautiful booklet comes inside the dvd cover and a beautiful cover it is.<br />i'm tired of all the paul bashers out there and his singing of For YOu blue was nice and his introduction to george's song Something was wistful and simple, leading into the full band version.<br />as proven by all the 5 star reviews, this concert and dvd are a joy, a treat and a moving experience.<br />in the same vein, may i also recommend another outstanding concert recorded and available on dvd and that is david gilmour in concert.<br />very similar in performance and professionalism.ng image of his father as he was when a young man. it was uncanny to watch.<BR>one reviewer suggested that ringo singing honey don't did not really fit in to the program and was corrected by another reviewer that carl perkins was in fact a large inspiration to george and therefore very fitting.<BR>i interject another case of did it fit however and that would be the song performed by jools holland and sung by (a very foxy looking) sam browne called HORSE TO THE WATER. now, what this has to do with george harrison-i'll be happy to be enlightened.<BR>thank you.  <BR>a beautiful booklet comes inside the dvd cover and a beautiful cover it is. <BR>i'm tired of all the paul bashers out there and his singing of For YOu blue was nice and his introduction to george's song Something was wistful and simple, leading into the full band version. <BR>as proven by all the 5 star reviews, this concert and dvd are a joy, a treat and a moving experience. <BR>in the same vein, may i also recommend another outstanding concert recorded and available on dvd and that is david gilmour in concert. <BR>very similar in performance and professionalism.
B00005JM02|5.0|I normally don't purchase Region 1 DVDs, however I couldn't wait for FN to come out on DVD in Britain so I snapped it up immediately.  This Pixar animation comes closest I've ever seen to turning cartoon vision into 3 dimensional reality with characters and visuals which are simply stunning.  This tale of unfunny clown-fish Marlin, (Brooks) and the irrepressibly charming and cute but forgetful blue tang Dory, (Degeneres) is a heart-warming tale of paternal love, self-discovery and friendship underlying a dialogue which is nothing short of hilarious.<br />The underwater visualisation is enchanting, and characterisation of sea-creatures and their prey nothing short of original and side-splittingly funny  - vegetarian sharks following a 12-step ''fish are friends'' program, Surfer-dude Turtles, flatulant seagulls and shape-throwing Tuna-  you get the impression that Pixar have not only been cognisant of their duty to stun visually but have spent an incredible amount of time in investing in enchanting and 3-D characters which you just walk away from loving.<br />Degeneres steals the show with her natural comedic intonations and side-splitting interpretation of whale-talk, I was in raptures throughout.  A definite contender for Disney's greatest classic (along with Lion King and Beauty and the Beast)&lt; this is one movie I'll cherish.  I haven't met one person disappointed in this movie.  A confident purchase which will entertain all ages.
0689835604|5.0|This book is a favorite with my 2 year old and my 3 and 1/2 year old. The flaps are big enough that my younger one can easily lift them. The illustrations are just adorable and my kids always want to read it over and over again!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|crikey...wot can I say. I got my tix for the show in Belfast next February and all I can say is off the back of this cd, it will rok even more than her missundastood show in Dublin November 2002.  This cd ups the rock ante on P!nk's last offering and is done so with some guts and balls.....not one to be trifled with P!nk shows she's here to stay in a gutsy opus which runs the gamut of different musical styles in a way that only Madge or Xtina can dream about.  Trouble is a riotous opener for Ms Moore and really sets high expectations - a gritty rock song with an xplosive chorus and cacaphonic creascendo.  Well impressive.  First 5 trax really are awesome.  Giod Is A DJ is one of those thunderous stadium type anthems which ring in your head and really showcase the husky force of P!nk's vocals.  Last To Know an angry repudiation of a guy who leads her on and Tonight's The Night a funked up reggae type pop song which just commands you to have fun.  Peaches duet Oh My God is sensuous and hanuting while maintaining an indie-punk typ edge.  Quite revelatory.  We then move into more 'album-track' type songs all of whiuch are very good, but it's the tail end of the cd which fires up again starting with Humble Neighbourhood which has definite strains of Pink Floyd's Hole IN The Wall.....really accessible and brilliant.  The Charlie's Angels song Feel Good Time fares much better on album than as a stand-alone single...the final song,  Love Song is P!nk at her most tender and has to be a single.  Xposed and raw, a true gem in this album's crown.  There's a hidden track called Hooker which is a hoot - brilliant but naughtee lyrix ahoy.  But hey, this is P!nk.  To summarise this album is hard as each track has its own identity (rare in today's age) and all demosntrate P!nk's creative genius as an artist and musical performer.  Both accessible and challenging, this cd while acquire many admirers and listeners.  A natural progression onwards from M!ssundastood, you get the feelingP!nk's audience will 'get' this cd.  Roll on February!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Though some say The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is the best western of all time, many like myself tend to give that title to his film.  I feel it (just barely) beats out GBU.  This is an amazing fantasy film set in western days-it grips you from the start and doesn't let go until the end credits.  Unless of course you don't like westerns or like Dude, Where's My Car?-then you'll tune out before the opening credits are finished.  This film has the one and only Charles Bronson as the hero of the film, and hopefully his performance should shatter people's notions of Bronson's acting ability.  He's right on par with Eastwood as the embodiment of the cold, silent gunfighter.  It's also fantastic to see Mr. Twelve Angry Men himself play a villian as ruthless as Lee Van Cleef, if not moreso.  Claudia Cardinale was a great choice for a female lead.  She's extraordinarily good looking, yet has a very strong badass-ness about her.  If you're big on Leone's westerns, you've no doubt seen this a few times, but anyone who has been putting it off shouldn't wait any longer.  Why?  Coz this dvd is a fantastic package for the price.  You certainly don't have to listen to me though;  Take a look at the reviews for this film!
B00005LOUS|1.0|The Grinch makeup has rendered Jim Carrey unrecognizable.  Just as unrecognizable is the original Dr. Seuss story after it received this dreadful Hollywood mauling.<br />The movie is over-produced & unbearably loud.  Jim Carrey, as he so often does, over-acts and is generally obnoxious.  The movie is overly long, which only adds to the misery it causes for the viewer.<br />I was never overly fond of the 1966 animated Christmas special, narrated by Boris Karloff, but compared to this turkey, the 1966 version comes across as High Art.<br />I guess this is one of the sacrifices one makes for having children.  Any adult without kids who subjects himself to this garbage is in need of professional help.  It is movies like this that make me glad that Christmas is only once a year (of course, now we have The Cat in the Hat with which to deal!).
B00001OH7P|5.0|This is (in my humble opinon) Bowie's best album, one that could arguably be said to have triggered the glam rock afficiando that reigned in the 70's and early 80's. Bowie shows his masterful efforts at lyricism and his exuberehent personality whether its his or his significant other(ziggy). The wailing guitars and fast paced drums(along with Bowie's excellent vocals) soundtrack this story of an alien that becomes a rich and famous rockstar only then to die at the end(Rock N' Roll Suicide-excellent title). The stand outs are Five Years, Starman and Rock N' Roll suicide, each song contains sincerly sorrowful yet somehow witty lyrics and great music. Five Years starts off humbly with just Bowie's vocals and some light drums that soon blossoms into an orgasmic peak of vocals, drumming, guitars and keyboards. This entire cd is one of the greatest rock records ever, and definitley the best of the glam rock era.
B00004R99I|1.0|My wife used to rent this video for our son, until I made her promise never to bring it into the house again.<br />Where to start with this movie?  The history, or lack thereof?  One could spend hours discussing Disney's shredding of history in this movie, and certainly, many previous reviewers have levelled ample criticism at Disney for the copious inaccuracies.  Suffice it to say, I do not approve of the idea that we should somehow whitewash history to make it more appealing to modern-day sensibilities.  What kind of message does that send to our children?  I agree that little kids probably aren't ready for the reality of European conquest of the New World; in that case, tell them the historical truth when they are ready to handle it.  Don't lie to them, and don't package those lies in some cutsey cartoon.<br />Was the historical inaccuracy of this movie my real problem?  Not particularly; I have come to expect such willful distortions from Disney in most of its &quot;adaptations&quot; of literature (Hunchback of Notre Dame), history &amp; mythology (Hercules).  It really is par for the course with The Mouse.  My real problem comes from the fact that the movie is truly unbearable to listen to, thanks to the high-pitched caterwauling of Judy Kuhn (Irene Bedard having provided the speaking voice for the indian princess).  Sorry dear, but screeching high &amp; loud with a wobbly vibrato does not good singing make.  It does make my head throb with pain, though.  It didn't matter where I was in the house, I could hear Judy screaming at me, as though she were stalking me.  This made for a particularly bad Disney soundtrack, which is indeed saying something.<br />Now, we have 3-month-old daughter, and I am terrified at the prospect that Pocahontas will somehow sneak into our house again in the not too distant future.  I am determined to make her life Pocahontas-free if at all possible.
B0000C1733|3.0|This could be 5 stars rated but it is not.why? that's why :<br />there is a good song \\"Higher ground\\" (Stevie wonder cover) from their 1988 classic album \\"mother's milk\\" - why haven't they put something more representative like \\"taste the pain\\" or super hit \\"knock me down\\"? that is beyond me.<br />where is one of their biggest nineties hit \\"Aeroplane\\"??? they have put \\"My friends\\" from the same year that actually haven't been heavily popular (but it is very good) .\\"Warped\\" (hit single) could be a great choice too...<br />why have they put \\"Universally speaking\\" their worst single ever? this anemic and not really catchy song from \\"By the way\\" could be replaced with much better b-sides from this album like \\"Gong li\\".<br />anyway - i understand that it is a continuation to \\"What hits\\" and it shows their new modern funk-rock-pop sound but why it is missing so important songs? i do not understand...<br />ps.Happily two new tracks are very good.
B00005LOUP|1.0|This film is completely annoying and although I admired Jim Carrey's performance, it still wasn't enough to overcome the dreary production design and unpleasant tone of the film.  Rent the animated classic instead.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|i loved the cd. the whole entire cd was great. theres nothing bad to say about the album. she chose wonderful people to collaborate on this album from madonna to the ying yang twins. theres not one song on this cd that youll not want to hear.
B00005R62K|5.0|The more times I hear this essential Judas Priest album the more fresh it sounds.  But I had no idea what it could sound like remastered.  Wow!!! What an incredible difference this CD brings to the table.  The instruments are crisp and supercharged.  Long before I got this CD I had returned to this masterwork many times, but with this newness infused in the mix I plan on listening for years to come.  This is easily one of Judas Priest's best albums, and I highly recommend purchasing this CD remastered.
B000002HMH|4.0|I can understand why a lot of the Diehard Metallica fans find this CD down right terrible. I myself got into Metallica when Master of the Puppets came out through word of mouth from friends. In some cases I wasn't too surprised on how LOAD was going to turn out. I mean Songs like The Unforgiven and Nothing Else matters from the Black CD should of been an indication that the LOAD CD was going to have some different sounds to it. First off this is NOT a Metal CD. Metallica took thier sound in a different direction in the form of Hard Rock. Even though Load and Reload are more of just a Hard Rock sound it is a Hard rock sound with its own style and Bite to it. The only Track on here that I found to be surprising was Mama Said..really mellow in all aspects of the word even for Metallica. I think Change is good only if its done right. For Metallica Load and Reload was just a sign of musical expansion for them. I know a lot of people think that they sold out with this album but to me I think they wanted to Grow musically with their sound and they did it here with this CD. Musically this CD is structured well and lyrically its Solid. Every Band Changes at some point in their Career wether it be a subtle change or something totally different. When I listen to Load and Reload I don't listen to it on the same level as Master of Puppets or and Justice for all.. Honestly you can't. I enjoy and listen to Load and Reload for what its worth..... Hard Rock... nothing more, nothing less. My Favorite tracks are: Bleeding Me, The Outlaw torn, King Nothing,The house Jack Built and Until it Sleeps. Load and Reload are Solid CD's in their own right. Just my humble opinion from a guy who has been listening to Metallica since 1986.<br />And yes unfortunately they did eventually sell out in the form of the whole Napster incident and St Anger. Sad But True.
B00005MP58|1.0|After viewing the video version, what a disappointment to see the DVD! All the rich, beautiful colors and details of the video are either washed out to white or lost in dark shadow on the DVD. How A&amp;E can claim this is 'remastered' is amazing when it looks like a bad bootlegged version. I've written to A&amp;E--no response. They are probably tired of the complaints from fans of the original. But I would not purchase any other items related to A&amp;E because of the poor quality and poor customer service. There are some snippets of scenes in the 'behind the scenes' portion of the DVD that have the original high-quality color. Too bad it was lost in the 'remastering'.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've had a long time to study Madonna's grossly misunderstood masterpiece, American Life. This is not an ordinary Madonna album - in fact, it is not ordinary in any sense. It's purpose was to be a cathartic, moving, and melodic journey through love, relationships, and the obstacles that get in our way and force people apart forever. One of the obstacles is war, which the cover art suggests. Other barriers between ourselves and happiness (which Madonna correctly defines as love) include the myth and superficial beauty of Hollywood, greed for material things, looks, and money. Madonna conquers all these illusions of happiness, exposing them for the &quot;traps&quot; that they are. <br />Funny, how the majority of Madonna's fans don't get it!  Some foolishly claim, &quot;where is the beat?&quot; or &quot;I can't dance to it.&quot; This is not necessarily music to be happy to and dance to. It is an album unspoken tragedies - in an unconventional sense. <br />Madonna has proven with this album that music has the power to persuade just as much as the greatest work of fiction. Music can be just as melodramatic, ethereal, and morally edifying as it can be entertaining. Madonna's masterpiece, American Life, can be all of the above if you have the intelligence and open mind to enjoy it - and learn from it. <br />In time, Madonna will have a commercial comeback, praised by critics everywhere for being a popular success. American Life will be all but forgotten. For now, the only justification critics have for labeling American Life a disappointment is the great number of supericial music listeners in America (it was successful elsewhere) who refused to purchase it. <br />Being a relatively recent fan of Madonna, who has explored most of her work, I respect and applaud the new direction Madonna's music is taking. Consequently, I believe Hollywood and Nothing Fails to be Madonna's best singles since the days of Secret and Take a Bow. Hollywood reflects a jaded discontent, with adreamy idealism at its core. Madonna sings with a wounded hope - never feeling her lyrics better, and is supported by a wicked synthesizer effect. <br />Although Hollywood never registered on the billboard hot 100, it is unlikely it will ever be forgotten - being the subject of a controversial and genius VMA performance and a tacky Gap jeans commercial. Madonna knows how to sell the message behind her music, if not the record itself. Even if music listeners refuse to buy it, the cry never goes unheard.
B00005JM0B|1.0|Now I know why Ahnold ran for the governator.  He's lost his ability to make good movies.  This movie had no real plot.  It was one, long, painful chase scene.  And the chase scene wasn't that good.  T2 was better than T1. This is trash and does not deserve the right to call itself a Terminator movie.  Ahnold must have needed the money so that he could get into politics.  They needed a new script and a new director.  This makes Jaws3D look brilliant.

B000127LW2|1.0|Season one is only 15 episodes on 5 discs and they are still charging $100.00!!!  I refuse to believe the archaic pricing plan for these DVD's.  With shows like Buffy and 24 releasing DVD sets with almost twice as much content for $50.00, it is hard to stomach this.  Paramount's special feature list is never interesting anyway.  I suppose if you like the show you have no choice, which is the unfortunate aspect of our buisness structure.

B0000DZ3IG|4.0|This is a very good soundtrack for anybody who liked the movie to have, and my only beef with it is that it's incomplete compared to the british version of the soundtrack.  I compared the N. American sountrack to the one listed on amazon.co.uk, and it's missing 5 tracks.  Our version includes Christmas is All Around and All I Want For Christmas as bonus tracks which is great as the cd would be incomplete without them.  However, the british version has a different version of the song Jump for My Love, and includes tracks completely left off our cd by Otis Redding and Gabrielle, not to mention the 3 different love themes by the movie's composer, Craig Armstrong.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|Wow.  What can be said about this powerful release.  Admittedly, I am a Christian so the spiritual aspects of this album were only a bonus to the fabulous music.  But, from a musical standpoint, it has the trademark sounds of classic Spock's Beard all over it!<BR>As a long time Spock's Beard fan, I was thrilled to hear the real Beard sounds again, especially after the sorry release of 'Feel Euphoria' (SB's latest release without Neal Morse) which sounds like every other anemic, radio-friendly rock band out there. <BR>No, this is not a preachy album by any extent; simply a musical story of Neal's life experiences that lead him to a relationship with God.  But the music...wow.  Neal picks up right where he left off with Snow; telling a story using fabulous progressive rock music.  <BR>This album has a few musical twists as well such as the use of real strings and horns. There are some themes that even smacked of The Who's 'Tommy' as well (Sleeping Jesus) and a country sounding piece on disc two (I am not a country music fan by any extent of the imagination but Neal pulled it off tastefully and it fit in the story line). Very cool. These don't replace the Beard sound, but only add to it.  Neal explores new musical territory with these sounds but clearly puts his trademark, prog sound all over the album.  <BR>The musicians playing on this release are also top-notch (including Dream Theater/Transatlantic drummer Mike Portnoy and ex-Kansas guitar player, Kerry Livgren) and Neal's versatility on guitar, keyboards, vocals, and base are astounding.  A truely gifted musician in every sense of the word. <BR>And for the fans of Christian music, look out.  Unfortunately, Christian music is often as bland and anemic as a lot of secular music, but this will knock the socks off the Christian music industry if given attention.  <BR>If you liked Spock's Beard prior to 'Feel Euphoria', you won't be disappointed in this release.  The catchy melodies, great harmonies, quirky time changes, and creative lyrics are all here.  <BR>If you are not a Christian, don't shy away from this album thinking you won't be able to relate.  It's a life story that involves some spiritual experiences.  I mean, really, if you can handle Snow (a story of an albino man with a gift (??), a curious topic that did not diminish the quality of the music), you can handle Testimony.  Don't pass this up; you will be pleasantly surprised.  And for us hard-core Beard fans...the Beard DOES live.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let's start by stating the obvious, \\"Let It Be... Naked\\" is the worst album title I have heard in a long time.  I can't believe that this made it out of an EMI corporate roundtable as a contender.  That said, the music contained within is great.  Each song is great, however the necessity of a second [[ASIN:B000002UB6 Let It Be]] is going to be proportionate to how big of a Beatle fan you are.  Personally, I find this overall the better listen, although many tracks won't sound too dissimilar to most casual fans.  The definite highlight of this album is the version of Across The Universe -- this is a must listen.  (Although the song is wonderful in any incarnation... except perhaps the World Wildlife Foundation version now found on [[ASIN:B000002USZ Past Masters, Vol. 2]])  While this album isn't the awesome revelation I was hoping for, I don't believe that it deserves most of the negative reviews given here, despite the lame title.  For starters, although Lennon & Harrison later commissioned Spector to produce for them, neither was happy with the original LIB.  Also, people here assumed that McCartney cut Maggie Mae & Dig It to make it more Macca-centric.  McCartney didn't produce this album, EMI commissioned engineers to oversee this that were surviving (at the time) Beatle approved.  These were the two weakest cuts on LIB, especially the Dig It edit that merely disrupts the flow of the album without giving the listener much of a chance to hear the Beatle jam session.  Instead, we're treated to the much more worthy Don't Let Me Down, although the Get Back B-side version is superior in my opinion.  If this were to become a vanity project for McCartney (that Starr & Harrison would approve, no less) then he would've likely added Teddy Boy, which, along with Don't Let Me Down, was always intended for the Get Back album that never came to be (and that this album desperately wants to be.)  Instead of those two, we always got I Me Mine & Across the Universe.  I would havebeen happier if this followed the Get Back template that was revealed in the Sept 1969 Rolling Stone magazine (1. One After 909, 2. Don't Let Me Down, 3. Dig A Pony, 4. I've Got A Feeling, 5. Get Back, 6. For You Blue, 7. Teddy Boy, 8. Two Of Us, 9. Dig It, 10. Let It Be, 11. Long And Winding Road) adding I Me Mine & Across The Universe as bonus tracks. The Fly On The Wall disc is mostly studio banter and not likely to receive too many spins here. While supposed to be interesting to listen to, I would have rather had the entire rooftop show or some of the oldies but goodies the Fabs recorded during these sessions that never made the cut. (Shake Rattle and Roll, Blue Suede Shoes, Love Me Do, etc)  What did make this disc is a worthwhile listen that I will gladly give four stars, and I believe that the \\"under-enthusiastic\\" reviews have less to do with the album that this is, and more with the album that we wish it was.

0316776963|5.0|David Sedaris has done it again with a delightful look into his childhood, in the first half, and a sidesplitting recount of his French adventures in the second half of this book. <br />From learning of his early stuggles with his lisp (thus having difficulty with his own last name), to his description of \\"the rooster\\", his brother, a man's man whose speach is peppered with four letter words, Sedaris kept me laughing.<br />Those who have ever studied French will find his musing particularly wonderful when he ponders the masculine and feminine assigned to all objects: \\"I wonder whose job it was to assign these sexes in the first place. Did he do his work right there in the sanitarium or did they rent him a little office where he could get away from all the noise?\\"<br />I recommend this book one hundred percent. It is good for a laugh and also makes a great gift.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I have heard many CDs during my career, but this CD and Josh's performance stands head and shoulders above so much of the musical literature being performed in the mainstream musical world today.  Produced by the artistic genius of David Foster, Josh Groban's voice and talent has soared to even greater heights on this album.  Comparable in talent to the versatility of Canadian Cabaret Star Patricia O'Callaghan, Josh Groban has reached his well deserved superstar status through hard work, discipline and absolute impeccable attention to artistic detail and quality. Bravo!

B000002A46|5.0|I don't know what the reviewer was thinking when they wrote that whitney's &quot;One Wish&quot; is better.  im a huge whitney houston fan, but OH MY GOD, there's no comparison between these 2 albums.  Mariah absolutely nails the christmas feeling on this album, her voice is stunning.  I love the mix of traditional songs and her own writing.  Apparently this album recently overtook elvis's xmas cd to become the Biggest Selling Christmas Album of all time!! every year it comes out again, and every year it's a huge hit. again.  people who hate Mariah all go out and buy it.  and trust me there's a reason for that.  if u buy this album, u WON'T be disappointed, altho it will probably leave you wanting more.  (also recommend Celine's album &quot;These Are Special Times&quot;, Whitney's &quot;One Wish&quot;, and the Ally McBeal Christmas album).
B000024A70|5.0|If you only could own 1 album of queen, this is the one that covers all bases.  It is the sort of cd you can pop in and forget about, but enjoy every single track on it. Even the songs I'm not that familliar with, I still love.  The version I own has a different track order, but still the same songs I beleive.  Each and every song is better than the last.  An essential part of every rock collection!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This CD is a complete joke.  Her voice sounds worse than ever.  NO TALENT!  She sings like a baby
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has come out with another great CD. Don't bea  poor sport, BUY the cd instead of burning it! <BR>My absolute favorite song on this cd was Brave New Girl. Admittedly its mainly bouncing bubble gum lyrics its still quite good and different.<BR>Her ballads are great! Shadow rocks. When I first heard these songs I didn't like a lot of them. Then I listened to it like three times and I started LOVING THEM! Wheee! This is a great dance CD and definetly if you're a girl and like Britney you should buy it! It's MUCH better than her last one.<BR>xx brave new girl
0385474547|1.0|Last year, I read Things Fall Apart from cover to cover.  I would not advise anyone else to make this deplorable mistake.  Labelled as 'great literature' by many imbecilic pundits who think calling something 'great literature' will automatically make them connoisseurs of some sort, thus elevating them to the highest levels of society, Things Fall Apart appeared to me as more of a juvenile attempt at a sixth grader's first novel.  The author seems to have some sort of infatuation with yams, because the entire book revolves around idiotic descriptions of yams and characters struggling with their declining yam output.  As for the characters, they are developed poorly and not very likeable, thus, when the tragic downfall of the protagonist happens at the climax of the book, instead of experiencing the catharsis that the author probably intended I would, I felt nothing but sheer joy because the book was over.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|If you have good audio gear you will appreciate the clean no noise sound with out the unecessary over dubs done by Spector.  It sounds more like the other albums with a tight sound and no fluff material unlike the original which was loose and washed out sounding.  I love the refreshened sound personally and hope they continue with remixing old Beatle stuff as long as the originals are also still available.   The people who gave it a bad review puzzle me.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I must say never has there been a more sensational performer. Shania Twain will have you on your feet singing and dancing along. From the first song to the last all 22 of them. You'll really see and feel the passion that Shania has with every song see sings. The audience keeps up as the the band giving just as much energy and love as Shania! Buy this dvd!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|I simply loved the first two soundtracks and expected a lot from the Return of the King.  I was not disappointed; it's a beautiful score.  I especially liked the last track &quot;Into the West&quot; and the Gondorian theme present throughout the score.<br />It's definitely worth getting for any reason you can think of.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Non-stop entertainment from start to finish! Scenes of fans will have you eager to get concert tickets to go to a show and see first hand all the fun. Some of the best moments are on stage with Shania and the Fabulous Falls that's her bands name in case you didn't know. Extremely Entertaining! The pyro tech's are a delight! What a show! Get this dvd!
B00004T8RK|5.0|I bought Ten and Vs. when they came out, and then I kind of forgot about PJ for a while.  Then I heard &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; a few times on the radio (they only played it a few times) and I FLIPPED and bought the CD.  This album is great.  &quot;Parting Ways&quot; and &quot;Nothing As it Seems&quot; are my favs, but I also love &quot;Light Years&quot; &quot;THin Air&quot; and &quot;Soon Forget&quot;.  Some of the other songs take time to grow on you, but they do.  As usual, their lyrics are amazing.  This is not really hard rock for PJ, in fact most of it is pretty mellow, and I guess that disappointed some fans, but I'm glad they don't keep cranking out the same old stuff.  How 'bout that ukelele?!
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you have never seen shania twain live GET THIS DVD!!! Shania is one of the most amazing performers  because she involves the audidence so much  its like you are performing with her. Shania is such a caring and unique performer it is unbelievable. Also if you saw the concert on TV you didn't see it all get the dvd to see the WHOLE concert. You don't want to miss this!
B000002P5R|4.0|To have such a collection from Jimi after 30 + years is a real treat.  It's such a tease to hear this music and think of what more there might have been.  Jimi and bandmates Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell delve deeply into a funk-rock sound, leaving behind the psychedelia that was a mainstay of Jimi's first three studio albums.  The mood of the music is upbeat, and the lyrics are consistently interesting, and generously laced with Hendrix humor.  The arrangements are densely packed, yet lively and loose - a credit to Hendrix's own production.  Standout tracks are \\"Freedom\\", \\"Dolly Dagger\\", \\"Ezy Rider\\", \\"Drifting\\" and \\"My Friend\\", and each of these belongs in the pantheon of great Hendrix performances.  And for anyone who wonders what Jimi's state of mind was in the period immediately preceding his death, I get the sense from this album that he was a happy man, feeling at the top of his game and looking intensely into the future.     <br />Drawbacks?  Well, yes, although with Hendrix's untimely death during the creation of this album, we have to assume that some of the songs here wouldn't have made his final cut, and other unrecorded gems we will never hear would have made it in.  But with that said, there is limited songwriting range here.  You will not find anything here like the experimental jazz of \\"Rainy Day, Dream Away\\", the manically inspired blues of \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\", the gorgeous melody, poetry and sensitivity of \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" or the visionary musical journey of \\"1983\\".  These were all songs that revealed Jimi as the unpredictable and flamboyantly creative genius he was.  \\"First Rays\\" includes no such revelations, is more formulaic, and even includes a few tracks that you really don't need to hear more than once.  But a great album? Absolutely! And essential to your Hendrix collection.
B0000TB03W|5.0|With 5.1 surround sound this is amazing!  Shania leaves you wanting more. She moves around stage so much you'll wonder where she gets the energy. Then when you think she can't deliver anymore Shania makes her way into the all ready excited crowd. Positively a must have! Shania in the 105 minutes of this dvd will show you what a true performer really is.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|Up until now (not counting the horrible first singer on WDADU) I thought Dream Theater was one of the few bands that could never and would never dissapoint their fans.  Their albums were incredible.  I watched the bonus material that came with the CD and it says they wrote this album in 3 weeks.  What the heck?  They seem good enough to write an album in 3 weeks but I think they got a bit too confident with that judgement here.  I don't care how talented a band is, 3 wks is cutting it short.  Songs need to evolve and grow as a band writes them.  There are so many good ideas here but they are surrounded with a lot of crappy show-off excess that doesn't even flow right.  The album also lacks a lot of mood and feeling that previous DT albums have, which is one of the reasons they were so great as a band.  They think going heavy is the way but for them specifically its not.  I love heavier bands but its b/c they are good for being explosive and heavy. This album hasn't evolved enough from six degrees. Six degrees was good b/c it was better written and the heavy feel was something different at the time. <br />The best songs are, &quot;As I Am&quot;- reminds me of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;- similar style. Also, &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot;, &quot;Vacant&quot;- one the best songs I feel but so short and not explored enough.  Finally, &quot;In the Name of God&quot; is good, but not a future DT classic.<br />Overall, they should have wrote more songs than just enough to fill the disc, spent more time getting each song the best it could be, and thought more about how important it is to have fans that know each album you do will be the best it can be.<br />If your a DT fan buy it (it is an &quot;okay&quot; album- does rock a bit and has interesting and exciting moments, but if your new to them buy &quot;Awake&quot; or anything else.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish. If you saw the TV special you will find that the extra 6 songs on the dvd rock! There's a total of 22 songs in all. Shania's band always amazing.<BR>The crowd obviously love every second!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I greatly enjoyed Josh Groban's first, self-titled album.  I used it as study music, and occasionally would crank it up and bask in the wonderful melodies and rich voice.  I didn't think it could get any better, at least for this genre.  It did.<br />I am taken by surprise by &quot;Closer.&quot;  The music is even richer, and Josh's voice soars.  Highlights are &quot;Mi Mancherai (Il Postino),&quot; which showcases the gorgeous violin of Joshua Bell, and &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot;--the way this song starts out so simply and crescendos to an amazing melody is breathtaking.  Other favorites include &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; and &quot;Si Volvieras A Mi.&quot; <br />Superb.  If you enjoyed Josh's first album, this one will not disappoint you.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the greatest Shania DVD! I already have all the others I wanted to see what she had done for her Special from Chicago: I was amazed! The pure energy you experience by watching the DVD is without limits! It's like being there with all those thousands of fans in Chicago: Shania is fantastic! The songs, the sultry voice the fireworks! Buy this DVD and throw a party have the time of your life!
B0000DZTIW|5.0|.......but I'll tell you this right now: I LOVE this score.  And I'v had it for less than a day.  <br />This has to be the best score I?ve heard from Zimmer in a long time!  It seems like he?s getting better and better all the time.  After a wacky Matchstick Men earlier this year, he pulls of a great epic score and manages to make it very fresh and original.  I remember hoping that this wouldn?t turn out to be a Japanese Gladiator, and it isn?t!  The only score it sounds anything like to my ears is The Thin Red Line, with plenty of contemplative moments and thematic beauty.  I don?t really consider myself that much of a Zimmer fan, but he has made some truly great scores, and this is one of them.  It?s definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination, and worthy of your notice!
B0000TB03W|5.0|A stunning performance of Man! I Feel Like A Woman! Throughout the show Shania moves around  perfectly interacting with her band and working the crowd. If you attended the Chicago show you may just see yourself on the dvd as there are plenty of shots of the audience. The show contains a mix of 22 songs classic and new material. What an evening!
B0000VD04M|5.0|I can't believe it took this long to get this master piece on DVD.  My only hope is that they waited this long in order to produce a ton of high quality bonus features.  As for the movie, read the other posts, this movie is incredible!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania fans are going to enjoy this DVD! She sings all of her hits and some new songs from the UP album that she performs live in this Chicago concert. The pyro technics are a site to see. She is so interactive with her audience that she even invite a few fans to sing and dance on stage with her. A must have for any Shania fan!
0375703861|1.0|I don't have the time to list all of the factual inaccuracies in this book.<BR>It is terribly distracting to read the best written prose or watch the best told film that have been poorly researched.  <BR>The next time this author decides to write, homework needs to be done, and better editors need to be selected.<BR>Sorry, but we are not all that ill informed, naive or, stupid. I spent a year in Jamaica and traveled extensively throughout India on numerous trips.<BR>Please have some respect for your readers intelligence.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|First let's embrace the fact that album will sell, like all DT albums do.  The dedicated fans, myself included, just can't get enough of this mental fusion of five of the most exceptional rock musicians to grace the planet.  But I think this album may grab the ears of many who would in the past have shrugged them off or rolled their eyes.<br />Individually they stand as masters and mentors in their own right but it is how they blend their unique visions that sets Dream Theater amongst the all time greats in rock.  They have delighted their fans with more and more challenging works.  &quot;Train of Thought&quot; is no exception.  The aptly named collection offers a freestyle mental core dump of edgy, at times even angry epics, blending their past and present sounds.  <br />LaBrie pushes his voice into areas, only hinted to in past albums.  He has tempered the range showcasing, opting for edgy, emotional and at times even angry vocals.<br />John Petrucci has stunned me once again with absolutely mind boggling moments such as his solo, following Rudess' in &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; where he ascends a scale, with speed and grace like I have never heard before.  The dynamic duo of Petrucci and Rudess ascends to another plateau of musical mastery, soaring effortlessly through a forest of time signature shifts, scales and direction changes.  <br />Drummer, Mike Portnoy lays out one of his most impressive efforts to date and Ironically seems to do it effortlessly.  Several innovative moments are layered into his already unique and mind-blowing repartee.  Like an exposition of rhythmic possibility, he and Bassist John Myung, work together, suring up the bottom and everywhere in between.  Myung deftly negotiates the no-man's-land of each arrangement, serving as the glue that holds them all together, whether it be matching Petrucci's and Rudess' riffs or following Portnoy's percussive assault...or both.  Often, one has to strain to even pick him out of any given moment inthe song, though he is always there, in roaring, low presence. <br />I think this is their overall best effort, since their groundbreaking, Metropolis 2000 and is arguably one of their best works, ever.  Not for the musical faint of heart, this album takes the listener on a magic carpet ride of progressive fusion-metal that can challenge one's equilibrium.  It may turn off some progressive rock purists with its heavy edged approach.  Personally I couldn't help but crack an ear-to-ear smile when the concussive, double bass drum opening of \\"This Dying Soul\\" sent me back into my seat, or keep from banging my head at the catchy, Pantera-like, thundering riff in the middle of \\"Endless\\".  <br />Not since Metropolis have I been so delighted and intoxicated by their work.  This album is a home run that I will likely burn a laser hole through in the next three months.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|all I can say is WOW! Howard shore has really outdone himself this time. This score is not as dark as TTT and a bit louder than the first one, but all still holding the same sense of awe and fantasy. I believe that this one is the best album of the three, with some marvelous vocals (Tracks 3,5,8,15,16,17,18,19) and some Bravo! action sequences (Track 13, as well as others), this is also the most epic of the three. overall this is a must-buy not for only Shore fans, but for fans of the trilogy too! get this album as soon as possible!
038572179X|3.0|Unlike most other readers, I could not get into this story for I found McEwan's way of telling a story was both tedious and trifle and went on too long in setting up the plots and what went in between could at best be described as a story being well told (but could be much better told with a better Penmanship) and the final came rather too abruptly with unnecessary melodramatic mannerisms that left you with a feeling of bewilderment without knowing what and why all the big fuss was about.  <br />It was a simple story talked about very ordinary people and what went on in their lives after certain unjust had been committed against one person's better judgment, and thus it took her the whole lifetime to atone for her sin. But McEwan was trying very hard in making it into a much bigger story than it was with many unnecessarily pieces entwined in showing what went on with each individual's life and not near enough in getting into any charecter's inner world. <br />Many people gave much credit to the Atonement for its wider scale and seemingly ambitious plots thought it for being a more ambitious novel than his Booker prize winner Amsterdam, and I tend not to agree with this assessment; for Amsterdam was a novel much focused on its main themes and plots, and the story itself was a more interesting one to begin with. Although, like Atonement I found McEwan's writing was equally remote, unemotional and does not convey a true feeling at all. But in this case, since the subject matter in Atonement was dealt with emotions and feelings, and the story itself should justly demand more feeling and McEwan's aloofness in his writing style was totally unsuitable for a work of this kind.<br />Personally I don't think Atonement was a work should even rank along other masterpieces or deserved short-listed for Booker.  And it did cover longer period and wider scope than other McEwan's novel as I was been so told (I only read two so far). And the wider scope it covered was in the expensesof the tension. I agree it was necessary to fully brief the readers of the characters in the story in order to serve its purpose in setting up for a plot, but the way it went in telling the story of each individuals regarding one's daily activities was not only trivial but also unconvincing. It did attempt to explore certain inner feelings in certain parts and had done it superficially.<br />To give the book proper credits, the finishing section did seam very `unMcEwan' in writing and was written with feeling and vigor and elegance, and come to think of it, an unimpressive story that lingered on and on seemingly unable to get into anything deep enough except filling the pages with uninteresting details largely due to the writer' s unexciting style and lack of true conviction, then suddenly it came with an impressive grand finale. <br />After reading two highly rated but unimpressive books from McEwan, I could not stop but wondering why so many good things were said about this writer, and it will be a long time for me to summon enough courage and read another book from him. Given McEwan being an over rated writer amount today's pool of talents in literary writing, I truly sympathize those under rated ones who deserve much better credits and attentions than what McEwan received. <br />I was been critical in reviewing this book because of this overwhelmingly consistency in voting it a `masterpiece' but in fact it was just an okay book not without its merits, and it was a much over rated one from a good writer, and there are many better writers and books around and this one deserves at most a 3-star.
B00008NRI8|3.0|Writer/Director Marc Lawrence and star/producer Sandra Bullock scored a direct hit with their surprisingly good &quot;Miss Congeniality.&quot;  So, in &quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; they get the band back together.  This time, insert Hugh Grant for Ben Bratt, and change the Bullock ugly duckling-to-swan transformation storyline to start with hippie, crunchy granola lawyer instead of athletic, disheveled undercover cop.<br />In other words, all quite formulaic.  And it would all be worth dismissing outright were it not for the charm and verve of the two stars.  Bullock is the best physical comedienne working in film today.  Check out her tipsy boat scene in which she declares herself a &quot;twisty, bobcat pretzel.&quot;  It's a classic.<br />And Grant is back to his classic stuttering, fluttering persona, to good effect.  What can only be called his 'Hugh Grant-like' reaction to Bullock in 'twisty, bobcat pretzel' mode is also great fun.  [This*is* acting though.  He needs to get credit for that.  See 'About a Boy' to see what Grant is capable of when he's asked to dig deeper for a character.]<br />All in all, 'Two Weeks Notice' is worth a rental (or a purchase at the right price).
B0000CDLA7|4.0|ok being a dream theater fan ever since awake i will have to say that this album is really kick ass but not their best work. dream theater keeps evolving and trying out new things, unlike alot of bands that find a format and stick with it for their whole recording career. for them to come out with an album that is so different then their previous work was not only neccessary for the evolution of the band but neccessary to let the fans know what they are capable of. their last album was a great transition from scenes from a memory to this album.... they are genuises. i would not only get this for the music but get it for the sake of your DT collection.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I was fairly annoyed with the theatrical release, but this new version adds scenes which explain the motivations behind the new plot devices, and returns favourite bits from the book to the story.  A much more balanced and detailed movie than the original, and more fun, too.
156898443X|5.0|Line quality, is what makes &quot;Every Day Matters&quot; a book that matters. Danny Gregory's book is both unique and personal.  He tells  his story with his own visual vocabualy. His personal daily experiences come to life thru his drawings. Gregory's great line quaility make Every Day matter's a pleasure to read as well as look at.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Neither &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; nor &quot;BBC Sessions&quot; have done Led Zeppelin's live concert legacy much justice, but the recently released 3 disc set &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; documents both a long overdue look at Zep's power on stage and an example of how this monster rock band established itself in the U.S. What's more, for a triple CD set in a foldout package, the album is surprisingly cheap.<br />&quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is culled from 1972 Led performances at the L.A. Forum and Long Beach arena, displaying three CD's worth of outstanding selections. The sound quality is exceptionally clear for tapes just recently unearthed, as Robert Plant's screaming vocals are never drowned out by the exceptional circumstances of Zeppelin's sonic musicianship or packed houses of cheering fans. 'Stairway To Heaven' is finally given an all-electric treatment that outweighs its studio counterpart, but acoustic moments like 'That's the Way' are never out of place. 'Dazed and Confused' and 'Whole Lotta Love' meanwhile have been ballooned into twenty-minute plus epics.<br />Though one can argue that room should have been made for other perennial live favorites like 'When the Levee Breaks' or 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You' to name a few, &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is finally a great deal of justice to a band with such a legendary concert resume. One can only hope that a package of equal length documenting Led Zeppelin's 1973-79 live era will soon be released as well.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Me Against the Music and Toxic are pretty good, but the rest of the CD isn't very thrilling at all. It seems very overproduced and does not seem like much thought was put into the composition. My suggestion is to download the two singles off of itunes and forget the rest.
B00008BXJF|5.0|In a time where empty-hearted strings of pop reign, it's remarkable that a meaningful band like King Crimson has survived well into the 21st century. Over thirty years into its long and winding career (minus a couple of long hiatuses), the kings reward those who had &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; in quality music.<br />This fittingly titled new album shows why King Crimson has survived as long as it has. &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; is one of the band's most shameless and bold, ventures. The music is, as always is the case, uniquely textured and arranged, with ominous results. Adrian Belew's eerie but wistful falsetto performance on the four-part title series is original and effective, while the instrumentals that are showcased on the album (notably 'Dangerous Curves' and 'Elektrik') are among Crimson's finest. 'Eyes Wide Open,' which boasts a superb vocal performance and fine studio qualities, is one of the few King Crimson songs in its three-decade tenure that could have became a modern radio hit (&quot;could have&quot; being the key phrase here). Elsewhere in musical territory, 'Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With' is the ultimate anthem for anyone who finds themselves disenchanted and disappointed with today's popular music scene. Its gritty guitar and vocal work and heavy metal echo is challenged only by past Crimson songs like '21st Century Schizoid Man.'<br />&quot;The Power To Believe&quot; is a package of musical relief to both fans who have been praying for a new release since 2000's &quot;The ConstruKction Of Light,&quot; and to those whose senses have been damaged by the predictable bubble gum and rap that mercilessly dominates the airwaves.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd is amazing. Christina Aguilera did an amazing job as writer and producer. There's such amazing attention to detail. The lyrical and musical content is excellent. She covers everything and does it right. There's hip hop tracks like &quot;Can't hold us down&quot; about double standards and women being strong to party tracks like &quot;Dirrty.&quot; You also have the smooth R&amp;b sound of &quot;Get mine get yours&quot; and power gospel anthems like &quot;Soar&quot; and &quot;Keep on singin' my song&quot;. There's also a beautiful piano ballad, aptly titled &quot;Beautiful&quot; about love and acceptance. There are rock tracks like &quot;Fighter&quot; and &quot;Make Over&quot;. Everyone song on the album is beautifully sang and is worth the price of the cd.
B000003S0P|5.0|When one considers the high climax that &quot;Red&quot; achieves, the fact is amazing that it was made at a time when King Crimson had splintered due to Robert Fripp's decision to end the band for that time (a move that still has yet to be clearly explained). Released in 1974, it was the band's last album until the early 80s, and the nail in the coffin for the first life of Crimson. But &quot;Red&quot; is undoubtedly a prime accomplishment, full of raw power and perfected textures.<br />&quot;Red&quot; can be hailed as an unsung pioneer album for the term heavy metal. Fripp's sinister guitar grind showcased in the ominous title track and throughout the entire set echoes the sound of today's (somewhat less-inspired) mainstream metal. The lyrics reflect upon murder ('Fallen Angel'), an on the run dementia ('One More Red Nightmare') and guilt (the epic 'Starless'). John Wetton's strained vocals awkwardly soar up and down and Bill Bruford was establishing himself as one of music's most talented drummers. David Cross (who had actually left the band before this album's release) meanwhile makes his violin of anhedonia known on 'Providence,' a searing instrumental, and elsewhere on the album. A unique quality of &quot;Red&quot; finds trumpets and saxophones thrown in the same pot as the heavy guitar sounds, but here it actually works.<br />King Crimson is the premier prog-rock band, but this effort avoids all of the pompous cliches of that label; the music is honestly dark and raw, setting itself apart from anything the Crims had done previously. There couldn't have been a better way to end an era than with &quot;Red.&quot;
B00005RHGK|4.0|One of the best things about JEEPERS CREEPERS is the on-screen interaction between the brother and sister characters played respectively by Justin Long and Gina Philips. Like regular teenagers, they sardonically bicker, tease, and pick at each other when things start out, but when faced with a life-threatening crisis, the genuine love and respect that they have for each other shines through.  In fact, so genuine are their performances that, after watching the film, it is difficult to accept the fact that the two actors are not actually siblings.  Hopefully these excellent young performers will go on to even greater stardom as their talents mature and they fine-tune their art.<br />But the two young stars aren't the ONLY good thing about this movie.  No siree!  With JEEPERS CREEPERS, writer/director Victor Salva has pulled out nearly all the stops to craft an enjoyable old-fashioned spook-show.  Most of the action takes place in a rural setting during what appears to be early fall, and this creates a very eerie and unsettling atmosphere that harkens back to Tobe Hooper's THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE.  In fact, aficionados of the genre will no doubt notice that JEEPERS CREEPERS is replete with nods to horror greats from the cinema past, including not only Hooper's cult classic, but also such films as DRACULA, FRANKENSTEIN, PSYCHO, Spielberg's DUEL, HALLOWEEN, FRIDAY THE 13th,...and the list goes on and on.  In addition, Salva playfully and lovingly pokes fun at many horror clich&eacute;s--worn-out devices like the old dark house, the darkened tunnel, the urban legend, the barely audible warning from a dying victim, the phone call from a stranger, the warning from a psychic, and many more--yet he does so in clever and witty ways that add to the fun of the film and the logical progression of the story.<br />What would an old-fashioned monster movie be without a monster?  And does JEEPERS CREEPERS ever have one!  Somewhat reptilian in appearance and extremely cunning and intelligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).  Extendable and retractable facial appendages, a mouthful of sharp teeth, big fold-out bat-like wings--all this, and it sews, carves wood, and drives, too!  And in keeping with the nostalgic undertones of the rest of the film, this monster also has characteristics that are reminiscent of nasty cinema favorites from days gone by: DRACULA, the FRANKENSTEIN monster, THE CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON, television's GARGOYLES (1972), the aforementioned titular ghoulie from ALIEN, and more contemporary monsters like Freddy, Jason, and even HANNIBAL the Cannibal.<br />Filmgoers who enjoy the fun creep-shows of yesteryear will get a real kick out of JEEPERS CREEPERS, but it is also modern and hip enough that younger, less nostalgic genre fans should enjoy it, too.  The DVD from MGM is loaded with cool extras, not the least of which are a feature commentary from writer/director Salva, alternate openings and endings, and some interesting behind-the-scenes featurettes. This one's well worth the price of admission.ligent, it is of the coolest, creepiest monsters to hit the cinema since 1979's ALIEN (and its sequels).

B000002BFL|4.0|Bruce Springsteen's 1995 release &quot;The Ghost Of Tom Joad&quot; is almost always compared to his haunting 1982 masterpiece &quot;Nebraska,&quot; and for obvious reasons; the form and mood of &quot;Tom Joad&quot; is the same as its predecessor--a bare minimum of instrumentation and the same desperate, gloomy, brilliant subject matter. But &quot;Nebraska&quot; had something this album doesn't--the former was spontaneous and unexpected, while &quot;Tom Joad&quot; was planned and anticipated. &quot;Nebraska&quot; was perhaps most effective because it followed the success of his mainstream hits like &quot;Born To Run&quot; and &quot;The River,&quot; and its strictly vocal/acoustic/harmonica approach made it brilliantly different from Springsteen's previous chart-toppers. And that's where &quot;The Ghost Of Tom Joad&quot; fails; it simply cannot be viewed as genius as &quot;Nebraska,&quot; because the public was ready for it, and already knew the power that the 1982 album spawned.<br />Aside from that, this album surely isn't a disappointment; it is stark, bold, and magnificently eerie, despite the slightly expanded instrumentation (at least when compared to the bare form of &quot;Nebraska&quot;). Outstanding compositions like the title track, 'Across the Border,' and 'My Best Was Never Good Enough' are all superb, while as a whole, the album holds up strongly as a testament to Springsteen's crusade for the downtrodden. Though it doesn't exceed &quot;Nebraska,&quot; &quot;The Ghost Of Tom Joad&quot; is perfect for a sequel.
B00003CXSM|2.0|Two words successfully describe &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot;: Pee yew. With an exclamation mark. It's boring, contrived, silly and not very funny at all. Its two main stars, Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey, share absolutely no sense of chemistry whatsoever. The plot allows for devilishly funny situations that never arise from the recycled and visibly tired script. It's like sitting through a rerun of an old movie you've seen a million times before. And not a very good movie, for that matter.<br />JHo - I mean, JLo - plays Mary, a wealthy wedding planner (hence the title) and control freak who is lonely and neglected in real life, forming no relationships for herself. That is, until she meets a doctor (McConaughey), who rescues her after she gets her high heel stuck in a pot hole in the middle of a busy highway. (Don't ask.) He takes her out to a fair and they dance and almost kiss.<br />Then she finds out that he's engaged. Not only that, but he's engaged to one of her closest and friends. And, to top it all off, he's also her newest client - she has to organize his upcoming wedding. Then, his fiancee flies out of town for a week, leaving the two flirters together to sort out the wedding, and perhaps fall in love with each other during the process. But that will mean breaking up the wedding, right? Matters don't help that Mary soon becomes engaged herself to a man she has known since childhood. Why? Who cares? It's all part of the contrived plot I was ranting about earlier.<br />First problem: The cast. JLo can't act. Not only that, there's no chemistry/sparks between her and McConaughey, who also can't act his way out of a paper bag (or from behind JLo's most famous behind, in this case). And she also can't handle the role of the Beautiful Lonely Single Female, a role Sandra Bullock can carry off because she doesn't act like a...well...JHo the entire time.<br />I like romantic comedies, especially the entertaining and sweet kind. A romantic comedy doesn'thave to wow me over with its plot or technical achievements; all I ask for are likable characters and an entertaining premise, recycled or not. Good evidence of this is &quot;Alex and Emma,&quot; a film I attended a screening of some small number of weeks ago. I enjoyed that film despite its many negative reviews because I found the characters sweet and the story entertaining. &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; is neither. It is both annoying and revolting, with unlikable characters (who come off as selfish and whiny as opposed to generous and optimistic) and a bad bundle of jokes.<br />And as I stated above, &quot;The Wedding Planner's&quot; premise is like a rerun of another old romantic comedy - but not a very good one. The woman who has it all together is lacking love in her life; when she finally finds true love she can't have it. Quoting Dr. Evil, &quot;Boo-frickety-hoo.&quot; <br />The movie was directed by Adam Shankman, who has directed &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; (2002) and &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; (2003), the latter of which is very similar to this film and also quite unfunny at times. But at least &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; had a top-notch cast, and at least it made me laugh - if only a handful of times. &quot;The Wedding Planner&quot; didn't make me laugh at all; it didn't make me care about its cute couple; it made me want to vomit. That's not a good trait for a romantic comedy that boasts how cute and funny it is. Quoting one of the most catchy taglines for a film ever, &quot;You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl.&quot; Take away the laughing part and you've got a two-sentence summary of this terribly mediocre movie.

B00003XACV|1.0|Thomas Newman may be good at sound editing and selecting great songs for great movies, but please don't give him credit for the songs!!  David Lee, the brain behind the theme songs to Shawshenk Redemption and American Beauty didn't recieve the credit that he should have.  If you want a real soundtrack, purchase his Album Jakatta: Visions.
B00000613T|5.0|I was stunned by the brisk pace of the Rondo when I first heard it. I generally prefer faster tempos in conductors' interpretations of most musicians, but almost thought Boulez was rushing Mahler -- almost.<br />Further listening said he approached to the edge -- and stopped, precisely, just short.<br />Otherwise, Boulez's approach to Mahler sounds even more starkly defined here than with some other symphonies. (I have Boulez w/the 6th and 7th.)<br />This isn't for everyone, but if you want a clean, nonromantic cut, this is it. If you're looking for a better older interpretation, go with Sir John Barbirolli.
0060005424|5.0|This is definetly the best book I have ever read.
0553266306|4.0|The plot of The Day of the Jackal is flawed in two ways. Early in the story, before he has accepted the assignment to kill de Gaulle, the Jackal flies from London to Vienna, meets the three OAS leaders who seek to employ him and, after agreeing to the assassination, spends the night at an airport hotel before returning to London the next morning. At this stage, well before he had assumed any of his several disguises, he must have travelled under his real name. Soon after the French authorities learned of the plot, they also learned of the meeting in Vienna. Since their suspect was English, why did they not have all passengers from England to Vienna at the time investigated? They would have found the Jackal, under his real name, flying to Vienna on the very day of the meeting.<br />Secondly, there is insufficient attention devoted to the means by which the Jackal, who supposedly left nothing to chance, planned to escape after the assassination. He had made sure of his escape route from the apartment building overlooking the station forecourt, but where was he to go? How could he leave France, with no further disguises available to him and with a hue and cry after a man answering his description? He had no documentation and, even had he done so, any passport would arouse suspicion because there would be no evidence of his entry into France. His four earlier assumed identities, those of Duggan, Jensen, Schulberg and Martin, were all known to police. There is no mention that he carried his own, genuine passport which, even if he did have it with him, would have no entry stamp for France.
B0000C9V3T|1.0|What a freakin' joke this soundtrack is. These tunes aren't even borderline cool, rather they are tired and highly forgettable. Oh well, at least we still have Res Dogs and Pulp to fall back on.
B000089RVX|3.0|I bought this CD at Target one day thinking it would be your average alt. rock CD. The first 3 songs were good but then it started getting really depressing. Haunted was just..well..creepy. It's not a bad album but I just think it's a little melancholy for my taste. Amy Lee does have an amazing voice,though. And the CD definitely doesn't lack talent!(Though the guitars do get a little bland at times)
B00008QSA5|2.0|The answer is Mike Bloomfield of course(star #1). He does lay down some of the finest blues guitar I've ever heard anyone play--black or white on this (Albert's Shuffele 5 stars). Also, if you are a bassist--you have to check out Harvey Brook's playing on this--unreal, creative stuff(Star #2). So yeh, he and Bloomfield are the musical Ubermench here...but the contributions of Kooper and Stills are just pathetic...suffer through an anemic Season of the Witch and you'll know what I mean..the only interesting thing on this cut is the bass. Kooper is no singer..nore is he that outstanding as a keyboard player. The extra cuts scans horns don't add anythig other than to point out how bad they are without them. This was hardly a Super Session..really..Bloomfield by this time was a sick, strung-out heroin addict..and left Kooper in a learch after recording 5 cuts allbeit 2 career toppers. So Kooper flounders around and comes up with Stills to record a few forgetable tracks and wella the fabled SS album. There isn't a track where the three of them are jamming together. Anyway...if you really dig Bloomfield it's worth it to get Albert's Shuffel..but the rest is dated drivle.
B0000797IO|5.0|The Good Girl is about the other half.  I guess that is what I liked about it.  Justine is going through the motions of her life at a retail job she is bored with and with a husband she can't stand.  When she meets the handsome young Holden, she suddenly starts looking at her life and taking chances in a self destructive way.  They begin having an affair and she puts her job and marriage on the line.<br />This movie is a dark comedy and Jennifer Aniston does a great job conveying the misery and disillusionment the character feels.  There are scenes in this that are hilarious while others are disturbing.  I know people just like this and felt it was more real than most of the movies out there.  Of course, there are times you want to kick Justine especially when she sleeps with Bubba but I guess that's the point.  People do crazy things out of boredom and desperation.  So the Good Girl isn't a good girl in the traditional sense.  She was a good girl gone bad.  The thing about her that irked me was that her life wasn't all that bad and she could have taken a class or done something positive rather than have an affair.<br />Ok, this might be a spoiler...<br />At the end, she has to realize what is more important: escaping her life or doing what is right.  I feel she made the right choice.<br />A great film that has some wickedly funny moments.  If you like dark comedies and stories about \\"normal\\" people, you might enjoy this.  A definite winner in my book but obviously not for everyone.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|&quot;I regret to announce that this is the end. I'm going now, I bid you all...&quot; the best. I sure will miss the rush of expecting more from the LOTR cast, after this, there's no more. I love everything involved with the movie and since I'm a composer (film score composer wanna be someday) I will miss waiting for the december to come...after this, the coming christmas won't be the same. I wish these movies will go on forever, but all WE have to decide is what to do with the experience that the producer and the cast left us with. To me, this has been the best cinematic experience of my life. These movied changed my life and I hope in the years to come anybody who watches the movie will still admire the great talent and work of the whole cast. enough said! 11/25/2003
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This one is great..this is a good gift
B00009TB5G|5.0|When this DVD extended edition arrived at my doorstep I was like a four-year-old at Christmas.  For the next five nights I hijacked the big screen TV to watch, savor, and enjoy Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of Tolkien's THE TWO TOWERS, the second installment of his masterpiece, &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />Sure enough, the 40-plus minutes of extra footage not contained in the theatrical release addressed several of the questions that left Tolkien purists--such as myself--scratching their heads in bewilderment.  I won't go into the details here (as they've already been discussed countless times already), but will state the extra scenes make watching THE TWO TOWERS a more enjoyable experience, for Tolkienites and non-Tolkienites alike.<br />But even more fascnitating--to me--were many of the features and documentaries carried in the third and fourth DVDs of this set.  There is a virtual avalanche of information to be gleaned from these features; here is but a mere sampling:<br />--Tolkien himself vigorously opposed his publisher naming the third installment of his book, &quot;The Return of the King.&quot;  As the author lamented, &quot;The title gives away the story!&quot;  Tokien wanted to name the final installment, &quot;The War of the Ring.&quot;<br />--Initially, the film adaptation of THE TWO TOWERS was to include the character Arwen (Liv Tyler) fighting side by side with Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) at Helm's Deep.  Jackson released this information on the film's website, and there was such a negative backlash the decision was made to have Arwen's character portrayed differently in the film.<br />--A very candid, satisfying explanation from Jackson as to why the tunnel of Shelob was not included in THE TWO TOWERS, but instead will be featured in the next film.<br />This DVD extended edition is six hours of pure Tolkien bliss--a visual and audio feast of exquisite proportions.  Block out some time in your schedule to travel to Middle-earth, and as Treebeard the Ent would say, &quot;Don't be hasty!&quot;<br />--D. Mikelseebeard the Ent would say, &quot;Don't be hasty!&quot;<BR>--D. Mikels
B0000BWVCJ|5.0|A great DVD for a great movie....this dvd is packed....especially enjoyed the interviews :-)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britneys given a new vibe to the sound were accustomed to from her and it is a change for the best.  The more Britney and her music matures the better it seems to be getting.  I was definately impressed by this album, and the unique sound she gave to it had me hooked.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Ok, ok, so there's no such word as 'quadrilogy' yet. Get over yourself, grammar boy. Who says it can't become a word? It makes logical sense, and besides, the word 'trekkies' is in the dictionary now! So SHUT UP AND BE HAPPY, JACKASS!<br />*ahem* excuse me.... well the petitions, ramblings, letters, death threats, etc. toward Fox havefinally paid off, and we are finally seeing the ENTIRE series being presented with the respect it deserves. The first two were great, and the third one was ARTISTIC. Many of you who have either been in the marines or have been raised under a rock usually don't know what the 'art' concept is. Fincher made a great film, whether you Anti-3's want to believe it or not. This new version will finally present Alien 3 as it was meant to be shown, and hopefully it will gain more respect. I myself have seen a bootleg of the precut, and i must say, it puts to rest everything that was disliked about it. The inconsistancies, the plotholes, and the general lack of information presented in the theatrical version of Alien 3 are covered up. Some of this stuff i can't believe they cut in the first place.<br />The special features given in this version should be astounding. I'm, of course, not going to review any of them yet because its not out. I pretty much only wanted to review the new Alien 3 and bash all those bitchy grammar school children out there.<br />Laser disc stuff on Disc 9.... I've always wanted to see that footage....
B00003CXTG|2.0|Pearl Harbor is a pretty rediculous tale. Hollywood strikes again with a war movie but a stupid love tale. This film, depending on which way you want to look at it, should not have been filmed.<br />If Pearl Harbor was meant to be historical docudrama of what actually happened that day, the money they spent was a waist. No one should ever try to make a Pearl Harbor movie, there's one out there that tops them all: Tora! Tora! Tora!<br />Tora! Tora! Tora! is ALL fact, except for maybe one or two scenes. Everything that happens in that movie REALLY happened in reality. Pearl Harbor, however, tells the tale of two lovebirds. Stupid... To add to this, the battle scene isn't even that great. Not that it is terrible, but it could have been better.<br />To start, the Japanese Zero planes were NOT green. They were silver. The makers of the film had them green so they would &quot;show up better.&quot; Several shots of soldiers being strafed by swimming or bodies floating in the water are from a distance, hiding you from the scene. However, there are parts that are very good.<br />Back to my main point, if this film was made for a drama but in war, why choose Pearl Harbor? Why not some battles in Europe or something? It's not as if that love story was real, anyway(and if it was, it was corny).<br />All in all, Pearl Harbor is overrated. If you see Pearl Harbor to see a battle scene, go ahead, but it takes an hour and a half to get there.
B000002VMH|4.0|With songs so consistently well-written and produced, Annie Lennox's solo debut is overall a mellower and enjoyable outing than most Eurythmics outings which generally had both superior and less-than-stellar moments.  Not here.  Two excellent songs - Why and Walking On Broken Glass - with the rest being very good.  I especially liked the addition of Keep Young and Beautiful, which shows that humor has a place in pop.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|This cd is one of her worse! Theres only three good songs on it: Me against the music, Brave New Girl, and Shadow.
B00005OAIE|5.0|The reason for the title will become evident in about a second when I compare it to one of my favorite albums of all time, U2's Joshua Tree. Now before you all start uttering a collective &quot;What???! This guy's nuts!,&quot; hear me out.  RFS is not the great album that The Joshua Tree was (and still is, damnit), but they are similar, in my opinion, because they both quite simply, flow. I mean, from one song to the next, all the songs in both albums are somehow intertwined and put them all together, and you get a story; a tale full of emotion and passion.  I just saw John Mayer in concert a few hours ago here in NYC, and the guy can play guitar!  I think the people who think the content in RFS is too &quot;lite&quot; or &quot;teenybopper-like&quot; need to see this guy live in order to truly appreciate what a good musician and songwriter he really is. And most importantly, he sounded like he was having one hell of a good time up there on the stage which made the music even more powerful.  I agree with some of the reviewers here.  The more popular pop songs, with the exception of My Stupid Mouth &amp; Why Georgia, aren't the best songs. My personal favorites are &quot;3x5&quot; and &quot;Back to You,&quot; which has awesome melodies.  &quot;3x5&quot; just transports me to a different time and place and that in itself is powerful stuff.  So listen to it again. Get lost in the flow; you'll thank me later...
B00004SCX6|4.0|This is not one of her best cds.  The best songs on here are Oops!...I did it again, and Lucky. <BR>If you really want to listin to a good Britney cd, i recommend you get her 3rd cd (called: Britney).  Its a lot better, and sounds better.

B000096FUD|5.0|I viewed this movie with slight trepidation, as Gilliam's last directorial outing was his least successful (Fear and Loathing).  However, I gradually allowed myself to be subverted into enjoying this atrocious account of Don Quixote's film adaptation.  That's not to say that the documentary is less than satisfying, it certainly is, but this movie made me ignominiously depressed at the very sight of Gilliam's nightmare, for I portentously suspect had this movie been completed as the director intended, it could have been his greatest film accomplishment yet (even toppling the immaculate Brazil and masterful 12 Monkeys).  Watching this tragedy unfurl was most debilitating because Gilliam is so persistently passionate about his work.  From the very introduction you feel the dedication and obdurate work ethic he attached to the project.  In what I recall was less than a week, Gilliam's production devolved into a financial fiasco, his supporters were running low on steam, and the main star contracted a demobilizing illness.  Yet throughout all of this, Gilliam's ardent support and desire to finish (or even begin) his movie still courses through his vains like ichor, and when the ineluctable conclusion rears its moribund head and Gilliam is forced to retract every bit of energy he ground into this film, it is truly sad.  While the documentary itself would probably warrant a 4-star rating, the supplemental disc is absolutely incredible, and is at times much more insightful than the film.  The Sundance Channel feature with Gilliam offers a unique perspective of Gilliam as a filmmaker, and espouses his thoughts regarding the completed account.  More intriguing is the feature where author Salman Rushdie confabulates with Gilliam about film, books, and everything remotely imperitive or oft times trivial about the &quot;business.&quot;  Essential viewing for any Gilliam fan.
B000000W6F|5.0|I've been reading the reviews of this c.d. and I have to say I don't think this album has recieved the praise it deserves. Let me put it this way if you like to rock and if you like to rock to hard rock like has talent. Your gonna love this c.d. and I don't use the word love lightly. I must say I wouldn't ever compare this c.d. to sabbath. This c.d. is a thousand times more talented to anything sabbath ever put out. It rocks harder than iron man and paranoid ever will. Maybe war pigs beats it, but thats only because war pigs is there only talented song, but I'm getting sidetracked. What I'm trying to say is the music on this album is extremely rad and that is why it is one of my favorite albums. This c.d. is tied with siamese dream in my opinion. The only thing that would put siamese dream ahead of it is the fact that billy's vocals are alot better on siamese dream, but the music on this c.d. is just as good if not better than siamese dream. The only thing I think this c.d. lacks is vocals, billy lacks the powerful voice that drives this kind of hard rock. Billy is kind of soft spokem he lacks the intensity that say Chris Cornell or Robert Plant has. If billy would have worked on his voice to make it more powerful than this would be in my top 3 favorite albums of all time.<BR>    A couple reasons why the music on this is some of my favorite. Drumming is awesome my god why don't more drummers drum with this intensity and accuracy. The drum fills on this are enough to make John Bonham cream his pants. Another reason the guitar is intense and hard and powerful. The solos are edge of your seat solos making you wait for what note comes next. Now theres also a whole 'nother side to this album with light rock and so on so forth. The like rock is some of my favorite. <br />In conclusion, this is probably my favorite pumpkins album (maybe siamese dream not sure yet)for the reasons stated above and if you wanna cd with the hard and the heavy yet also with light rock and all of that driven by talent do urself a favor and by this cd!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|While 'The Fellowship of the Ring' was about as close to the original as a movie could get to a book of its size and scope (and set a new gold standard for DVD's with the release of the extended DVD edition), 'The Two Towers' unfortunately differed greatly from the book in some key places angering Tokien purists (of which I do not number myself).<br />As a movie by itself, 'The Two Towers' is a stunning compliment to the 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' expanding on the themes developed in the first film and bringing audiences closer to the characters than ever and exciting them with some of the best action sequences committed to film.  Finally, like the first film, Peter Jackson refuses to sacrifice plot, character development and good acting on the altar of special effects.<br />To state it simply, the sequence of the seige of Helm's Deep (although fudging a little more on Tolkien's words, but not his vision) is a classic that will be forever be used to measure epic battle scenes.  The audience feels along with the heroes on screen, the terror and impending doom of the Uruk-Hai seige.  Then it is brought through incredible action sequences and to the very edge of complete dispair before a rousing climax.<br />The extended scenes that form this new release of 'The Two Towers,' much like the extended cut of the first film, meld seamlessly with the scenes from the theatrical release.  Probably the most egregious departure from the book was the portrayal of Faramir.  In the book he is noble and does not succomb to the temptations of the ring at all, where his brother Boromir failed.  The extended scenes add a little more depth and give some more redeeming qualities to him of which the theatrical release only gives hints.   <br />Moreover, like the extended DVD of &quot;Fellowship...,&quot; the documentaries and 'making of' featurettes do not contain a single extraneous moment.  To any Lord of the Rings fan the information presented is always enlightening and fun to watch.<br />The bottom line is this: if you consider yourself a fan of the film, you owe to yourself to buy or at least view several times this extended edition of 'The Two Towers.'

The Heretic Anthem - very evil; corey uses 666 about a million times in his most satanic voice, confusing lyrics, i still like though! 9/10<BR>7. Gently - i like the one from M.F.K.R better, but oh well.. its still good 8/10<BR>8. Left Behind - my favorite song on the album.  i love the lyrics, the tune, everything about the song i like.<BR>9. The Shape - this is an ok song... for some reason, the songs 9-12 never really appealed to me 7/10<BR>10. I Am Hated - This is a pretty good song.. the lyrics are good.. corey taylor does some neat screaming during the chorus.. or was that on The Shape.. hmm.... 8/10<BR>11. Skin Ticket - long and dull.. thats all i have to say 5/10<BR>12. New Abortion - for some reason, this songs sounds the same as 9 and 10... good song though... 8/10<BR>13. Metabolic - i like this song, especially the beginning.. its heavy and... well... AWESOME<BR>14. Iowa - this song i long... but i like the guitar in it.. how it stays the same for a minute or two and then the drums come in.. and then everyone starts playing and singing.. and eventually becoming a sick and twisted song... 9/10
B0000C83YJ|5.0|At first glance this album cover is, well... a bit disturbing. Boy George's strong image almost over shadows his talant, But it's the music that shines through. the album is chalked full of radio ready songs. Church of the Poison Mind has to be Culture Clubs best song ever, with it stomping motown thieving beat, and soulful singing presented by Boy George. His backing singer Helen Terry also shines as she provides her sterling backing vocals. The song is unusual in the fact that it rocks out instead of being a soft ballad. Changing Everyday, present a diffrent sound as well, a sort of latin jazz with scatting by Helen Terry. In That's The Way Boy george really flexes his vocal muscles and comes off sounding like a hybrid between Gladys Knight and Smokey Robinson. Of Course there are the Hits like Karma Chamelion, the only song in rock history recorded about the littel funky Chamelion, which like most of Culture Clubs songs you didn't really understand a lick of their singing about. The trend comtinues with the soulful ballad Black Money, with it ambiguise coure line,&quot; Do you deal in black money?&quot; The Chemistry with the back up singing in this is hauntingly beautiful.  The sound of the ablum changes with each song ranging from rock, calipso, soul, jazz, piano ballads and even some japanesse flute. This album is a pop gem which is usually over looked because of the fact the Boy George drag image is over powering. but if you can get past thatyou will find some really good music.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Let me say that I am a huge Britney Spears fan. Ever since &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; the song came out, I have loved her. True, voicewise she is no Celine Dion but she is a great entertainer and does sing better than most of us. This is a song by song review of the album.1.) Me Against The Music - This definatly will become a Britney classic. This song rocks. It will definatly gets you up and dancing. This song shows that out of all the pop princesses (Britney, Mandy, Christina, Jessica) Madonna has chose Britney as her successor. And she is worthy. 5/52.) (I Got That) Boom Boom - This song is amazing and WILL become a definate radio hit. This is unlike anything Britney has done before. Ying Yang is awesome on this track. So &quot;Get on the floor and shake that A$$.&quot; 5/53.) Showdown - This song really does show that Brit has finally grown up. There is a line in this song that reminds me of Prince. &quot;I don't really wanna be a tease, but would you undo my zipper please?&quot; 4/54.) Breathe On Me - Very trancy. Almost reminiscent of Madonna's &quot;Human Nature&quot;. 5/55.) Early Mornin' - Anybody who has ever been drunk and woke up with a hangover can probably relate to this song. 5/56.) Toxic - This will probably be on TRL soon. Great song! 5/57.) Outrageous - This song finds Britney singing about her life over the last two years. &quot;B girl ain't lost a beat. Jumped over drama and I landed on my feet.&quot; 5/58.) Touch Of My Hand - This song has Britney indulging in herself. Yes it's true! This song IS about MASTORBATION. It is a good song though. 4/59.) The Hook Up - This is nothing but a dance song. But for what it is it works immensely. 5/510.) Shadow - Shows off Brit's songwriting ability. The chorus is beautiful. 4/511.) Brave New Girl - Very eighties sounding. This is the only song on the album that reminds me of Britney back in the beginning of her career. 5/512.) Everytime - This is the most sincere and beautiful song she has ever wrote or sang. 5/513.) Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix) - This remix was totally unnecessary. They should have dropped it and put &quot;The Answer&quot; or &quot;Don't Hang Up&quot; in it's place. 2/5This is by far Britney's best offering to date. So to answer the question did Britney do it again. Yes, with flying colors. Actually she outdid her previous albums.
B000001FCB|5.0|Locals consider Elis Regina the most gifted Brazilian singer ever. She died too soon, in 1982. Tom Jobim is one of the creators of Bossa Nova and the conductor that made the genre famous worldwide. This combination alone would make this CD remarkable. But there's more. A lot more.   Elis was in her top shape in 1974 when the CD was recorded. The arrangements are subtle, delicate. Jobim's piano is sublime here. The recording is flawless, the textures, the tones, everything is crisp and present. Many takes are FIRST TAKES. The emotion was captured raw and sincere, very few overdubs were done.   A rare gem.  If you go to a Brazilian's home and browse through his/her CD collection, chances are this CD will be there. If you ask a musician from that country what are the top 10 albums ever, chances are this will be listed.  If you have to own ONE Brazilian CD, this should be it.
B0000T6JH4|3.0|I approached this CD with a bit of skepticism to begin with. I love the Beatles and have everything they ever did.<BR>Hearing some of the new mixes was good. I do like the new 'Long and Winding Road' mix as well as 'For You Blue'. Most of them, however, aren't that much different. 'Dig A Pony', 'One After 909', and 'I Me Mine'  more or less sound the same, except the sound is crisper.<BR>Part of my problem with this project is the fact that the 'Let it Be' album was FAR from their best work. It's hard to take a mediocre song and remix it to make a great song. Unfortunately, except for the three hits on the album, the rest is not up to the Beatles usual standards of greatness.<BR>If, by some chance, anyone at EMI should read this, once you get busy remixing and remastering such Beatles masterpieces like 'Abbey Road', 'Sgt Pepper', or &quot;A Hard Day's Night', then you'll hear Beatles fans everywhere start to cheer!
B00006ZCFH|2.0|I love Erykah Badu, but Worldwide Underground will in all likelihood go down (hopefully) as the worst CD this consummate artist ever released.  In a word -- it pretty much sucks!<br />Hopefully, Erykah hasn't blown up to the point that she believes we'll buy her music -- no matter what.  Can you tell I'm really, really disappointed in this release?  So, save your money and borrow a copy from another unfortunate soul who spent hard-earned money if you want to &quot;listen&quot; to Worldwide Underground.
1400031362|4.0|Well, since Mma Ramotske is unlikely to leave her beloved Botswana, maybe she could be an Advisor to Presidents There and Abroad (as in the United States).  Her common sense approach to detective work and life in general is not only effective but refreshing and satisfying.  In this third edition of her &quot;investigation of confidential matters and inquiries&quot; Mma Makutsi, her assistant and graduate of the Botswana Secretarial College with 97% in the final examination, exhibits her take-charge attitude.  Mma Makutsi assumes the title of Assistant Manger of Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors, the repair shop of Mma Ramotske's fiance who is suffering from depression and ignoring his once well-run garage.    Then, too, Mma Makutsi uses her initiative to solve a lucrative case to determine the moral character of the four finalists of the Miss Beauty and Integrity Contest.  <br />And Mma Ramotswe's firm handling of an arrogant &quot;Government Man&quot; could be a textbook lesson in the the fine art of assertive behavior that results in Satisfaction for all Parties.<br />I discovered that one of my favorite tea makers sells African Red Bush tea--now my preferred drink while reading about The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
076790592X|5.0|I thought this was an excellent book.  I would recommend it to everyone i know.  Once i started to read it i could not put it down.  Morrie was an amazing person.  He was thoughtful, caring, and had love for everyone.  He is almost like the perfect guy!  He really enjoyed life and tried to make evryone he knew also enjoy life.  He was always positive and tried to look at the brighter side of things.  We need more people like Morrie in this world.  Great Book!
B0000CDL93|5.0|The beauty of Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" is that it has and will for a long time still, engender a mass of hate, love, incomprehension and good old America debate.<br />Just this last week, being the 40th Anniversary of the assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy, there were two documentaries televised: one supported the claim of the lone gunman theory and the findings of the Warren Commission while the other supported the two+ gunman conspiracy theory with all the attendant evidence in support. Is there any wonder that we as a Nation have no idea what/who/why happened on November 22, 1963 in Dallas? Stone's \\"JFK\\" seems heavily dependent on the second 7 hour BBC produced documentary (ridiculous in that it is better researched that the Warren Commission!) for many of it's facts, though the BBC program looked at Jim Garrison's contribution to the investigation as a sidelight not the main event.<br />Be all of that as it may, this film is a lollapalooza: a fascinating, dramatic, though obviously slanted look at what was the most important and riveting event in American history until 9/11. And Stone does a tremendously effective job of marshalling all of the facts, fiction and theories into a dramatic whole. This is not a documentary, this is a film based on fact.  And since the only fact we all can all agree on is that someone shot JFK in Dallas on 11/22/63, it seems to me that everything else is open to speculation and interpretation.<br />Kevin Costner gives a bravura performance as Jim Garrison: a man so conflicted and so troubled by the assassination that he feels compelled to bring someone to trial for it. His summation scene, which goes on for nearly 45 minutes towards the end of \\"JFK\\" is so moving, so strongly felt, so incisively acted, so emotionally aware that we actually see Costner underneath the performance as Garrison: the third wall is removed and it is Costner not only speaking to us, he is speaking for us.<br />We will never know exactly what happened in Dallas on that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.that Friday afternoon 40 years ago, but we do have this film and Costner's performance as a reminder of what can happen when someone of intelligence and foresight tackles a problem and proposes a hypothesis: right or wrong is not the issue, making the effort is.
B00006RU5B|3.0|First off, I am a big ratm fan and i was extremely disapointed when they broke up but that is just how it goes.  I also dig soundgarden, sometimes.  When i heard the rumors of ratm with chris cornell leading the band i was skeptical.  would this new band be the same as ratm or would they mello out a little and be just another alternative band?  personally i find cornell's voice to be the worst voice in rock, he almost sounds like a drowning cat, but none-the-less the release of cochise made me get this album.  cochise is very similar to ratm but with laid back lyrics, it worked for me but the rest of the cd doesn't.  like a stone is the worst song on the cd, even tho ratm had some mello intros and maybe the odd song or two they were good songs, like a stone lacks everything that is tom morello.  even in the video tim commerford looks bored, and rightly so.  tom's solo in that song could be a lot better if it were a faster song altogether, but it isn't and i think it's a waste of his time and talent.  lose cornell and try to reconcil with de la rocha, it seems obvious to me that de la rocha and the rest of ratm cannot survive without each other, or atleast will not have the impact they did.  ratm was original, audioslave isn't.  cornell is past his time, grunge was over about 10 years ago when ratm started.
B00009TB5G|5.0|You won't get any meandering from this reviewer, it should be common knowledge that THE LORD OF THE RINGS is quite possibly the best filmed entertainment ever.  Period.  This Special Edition (although a must have item for just the significance of it) is more like a showcase for the scenes that were deleted for good reason.  Unlike FELLOWSHIP's Spec. Ed. which contains vital scenes not in the theatrical version and is presented in a perfect cut, TWO TOWERS Spec. Ed. contains more fluff.  Don't get me wrong, it's still great to see more of a excellent movie, however the experience is elongated with scenes that take away from the sense of dread that builds thoughout the theatrical version.  The scene at the end with MERRY and PIPPEN getting high is almost silly.  Hell, buy it anyway, just be sure to own the disc that came out in August as well so both versions can be enjoyed, they're worth every penny.
0375414053|4.0|I just finished reading this book and I have to say I loved it, with qualification. I realize many women me included do not manage international money funds, and have small children. However I do have kids and and I do work in office so there was still much I could identify with. However, Pearson's book is not deeply serious fiction, nor I think was it intended as such. There seems to be particularly British genre (Jilly Cooper, the Bridget Jones books) of light but clever writing that are highly enjoyable once you realize this is not \\"War and Peace\\", nor should you expect it to be  <br />Kate has great husband, two lovely kids, and a not bad nanny, and high powered job. Too bad she is stressed to the max trying to do everything. The book follows Kate through days so hectic they would give Pollyanna a migraine. Watch Kate pass off store bought goodies as homemade, mess up office wear with home (spit up on her suit and worse) and handle a rat in the kitchen when her in - laws are visiting and enjoy the fun. Tbe observations on women in the office are pretty on the money, especially the part about management viewing returning from maternity leave as favour not right. The child care hassles also rang a bell, believe me I could write a book myself on that topic. Richard,  Kate's long suffering husband gets short shrift from Kate and the author. I did not buy into the idea that the husband is not really on your team. However,for those of us who do not buy Armani, or fly to New York weekly, enjoy the fantasy. It was crystal clear to me what Kate needed to do to fix her life, and she finally does see too in the end, maybe. Having said that the book gets big points for putting the whole working mom scene on the table and discussing it's often stressful realities as opposed the the eighties maxim that you can \\" have it all\\". And some times you have to step back, look at this scene and laugh, and get a perspective on this life. I would call this one  chocolate cake for thought.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|If you love to dance, this album is for you.  We all know there are better singers, but the music on this album is excellent.  Britney also did some writing on this album and its not bad.  The only other Britney Spears album I have is &quot;Britney&quot; and this one is even better.  I like almost all of the songs on the album.  My favorites are &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot; Showdown&quot;, and &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; .
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|&quot;Is This It&quot; left me wanting more. &quot;Room On Fire&quot; not only did it satisfy my thirst for more Strokes but it also tapped into some nostalgia with the new wave sounding songs &quot;Reptilia&quot; and &quot;12:51&quot;.  Probably the best track on this album is &quot;Under Control&quot; where under the flutter of ringing guitars we can still hear Julian croon his worries away. Tracks like &quot;The End Has No End&quot; resembles some Guns N Roses like riff, with that Michael Jackson circa-Beat It drum fill. For a band to hit so many genres and tap into so many influences with such simplicty is just phenomenal.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is one of the best albums of 2003.Here are my favorite tracks on the album.<br />Hollywood,Love Profusion,Nothing Fails,Intervention and Easy Ride.<BR>You won't be disapointed.GET IT!!!!!!!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Ok so I purchase the CD for my 9 year old whom is a Britney fan since she was well 6, I quickly took it away from her player and into mine.  This is pop music at its best and a true crossover from mainstream bublegum pop to an amazing grown up rythm collection. <br />There will be critics that will slaughter Britney for the change, you know what?, these will be the same hipocrits that did the same for Madonna back in the Erotica days, which by the way I belive was one of the most misunderstood albums in the early 90's.  <br />Pay attention to Breath on Me, Toxic and Showdown but carefull if you are listening while driving, it gets hard trying to keep the car straight while jerking your body to these beats.
B00005JM02|4.0|The first time I saw this film I was unimpressed. After the &quot;Killing Bambi's Mother&quot; opening, the story seemed to meander about to an inevitable conclusion.  The key to enjoying this film is not allowing the sad opening to cut-off your emotional connection to Marlon and his son Nemo.  If you can sustain empathy with the characters, the story becomes one of profound personal development for a father that has been emotionally crippled by a tragety.  Through his trek he learns how to find the heart to take risk and really live a life instead of hide from it.  This film may be the darkest piece Pixar has made since &quot;Toy Story 2,&quot; but it is worth supporting for the beauty of the work alone.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I saw Gavin DeGraw at a Maroon 5 concert in Portland.  I never heard of him until I read the poster with his name, but as soon as he came on stage, he is one guy i'll never forget.  He sang his songs with such a prescence that can't be described.  His songs were so sensual and he had so much feeling, reminding me of a Ben Harper type musician.  I went out and bought his CD and fell in love with him and his voice.  This CD mesmerized me with his vocal skills and lyrics.  You not only have to buy his CD, but you have to see him perform live, you won't be dissappointed.
0679428895|2.0|I won't go into the details of the plot itself.  The professional and readers' reviews on this page do that.  I want to comment on the flow of the plot and the characters which inhabit it.  This book moves very slowly.  There is very little tension. What does it matter if someone stole this or destroyed that?  There can be no real resolution of these matters because the reader knows that virtually everyone in the town of Pompeii will soon die when the volcano erupts.  The characters might have been able to carry the reader along if they had been interesting, exciting people.  But, they are cliches.  The completely evil villain; the sad, ever moral good guy.  And they talk and talk and talk.  Until the last third of the book, there is virtually no action in this supposed thriller.  If  you want a fast paced novel with vivid characters, you might want to look elsewhere.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney is without a doubt the best performer in the world and this new CD illustrates how she has adapted to show how she and her music are maturing. She changes tempo and style in each different track to offer something for everyone. This is her best since OOPS!. Definately worth buying. Listen and you will become adicted to it.

B000127LW2|5.0|Note:  This is more of a commentary on the show than on the upcoming DVD.  But I hope it will help you in your decision to purchase Season One of Star Trek Voyager.<br />As of this date, I have only seen the packaging for the Voyager DVDs.  I'm not sure how the material is being presented.  But rest assured, Star Trek: Voyager's debut on DVD has been a long time in coming.  Many Trek fans have criticized Voyager for being aimless, the stories lifeless, the cast unlikable, too much Borg here, too little of this there.  The fact is, not everyone is going to enjoy what Voyager was offering.  Not everyone enjoyed Deep Space Nine (although it's a brilliant series), and not everyone is currently appreciating Enterprise for what it is.  As for myself, I happen to disagree with all of the negative criticisms.  In my opinion, I believe Voyager to be one of the strongest series, next to Deep Space Nine, in the entire Trek canon.  Every show has weak stories - not every show has a cast with an incredible chemistry.  Not every show has a story arch that persists for 7 solid years.  Not every show puts a woman in a commanding, leading role and manages to succeed as a character/captain, where others have faltered.  Voyager does all of this, and more.  It takes Roddenberry's vision of exploration and makes it the central focus.  In essence, this is Lost in Space, with a Starfleet crew.<br />For 7 exhilarating seasons, we join two crews (Starfleet and Maquis) who are unnervingly forced to work together as one, as they truly go where no one has gone before.  Thrown 70 thousand light years across the galaxy into the Delta quadrant, it's up to the intrepid crew of the highly advanced, intrepid-class starship Voyager to work together and confront a slew of new alien races, civilizations, and intricate conflicts in order to safely return home.  It's not always smooth sailing, and if you think you know how they make it back to Earth, think twice.  The number of riveting, edge-of-your-seat two-parters are plentiful and serve as captivating examples of how *great* Trek stories should be told.  It's truly a story of change.  The characters grow and develop into people you'll swear you know inside and out, and by the end of the show, you'll feel as if you made a `trek' across the Delta quadrant yourself.<br />The spectrum of Star Trek: Voyager is both broad and brilliant.  It has an epic quality that builds and builds each season.  I've grown to love every crew in each Trek series, but Voyager's crew is one that will hold a special place in my heart, always.<br />I suspect Paramount will do just as good, if not a better job on these than the Deep Space Nine discs.  If they come anywhere close, fans of the series should not be disappointed.<br />Everyone, get ready for the journey - all over again.  If you missed the show the first time around, you're in for an awesome treat!eat two-parters are plentiful and serve as captivating examples of how *great* Trek stories should be told.

B00005JKG9|4.0|If there was ever a film that deserved an Academy Award for best ensemble cast then this is it. Glengarry GlenRoss features a dream cast of thespian heavyweights: Lemmon, Pacino, Spacey, Harris, and Arkin. Alec Baldwin delivers an absolutely blistering performance as Blake. His character was not in the original stage play, Mamet wrote him specifically for the movie. Baldwin delivers a devastating monologue with ferocious intensity. Baldwin makes the most of his limited screen time as he dominates this scene with an astonishing performance. It is, hands down, one of the best monologues ever put on film. His performance is so good that the rest of movie is almost anti-climatic in comparison.<br />Director James Foley successfully transfers Mamet's play to the big screen by creating atmospheric visuals. There is a somber mood that permeates almost every scene. The movie takes place mostly at night during an oppressive rainstorm. Juan Ruiz Anchia's rich, textured cinematography is the key ingredient in giving Mamet's play a cinematic look. All the locations are given their own distinctive colour scheme, in particular, the hellish red/navy blue of the Chinese restaurant that the salesmen frequent. The overall atmosphere is dark, like a film noir.<br />Disc One features a 30-minute featurette entitled, &quot;Magic Time: A Tribute to Jack Lemmon.&quot; It is a touching tribute to the great thespian from the likes of actor Peter Gallagher, director James Foley and his son, Chris.<br />Director James Foley provides an entertaining and engaging audio commentary. The folks at Artisan have wisely edited out all of the stretches of silence and only show the portions of the film that Foley actually talks over.<br />Disc Two contains the bulk of the supplemental material. &quot;ABC 'Always Be Closing'&quot; is a 30-minute featurette on the real world of sales. The first half examines the various techniques that salespeople employ while the second half focuses on Glengarry GlenRoss.<br />&quot;J. Roy: New and Used Furniture,&quot; is a ten-minute featurette on a salesman named J. Roy and adds further insight into the world of salespeople but nothing to the movie itself.<br />The highlight of this disc are the audio commentaries by cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchia, actors Alec Baldwin and Alan Arkin and production designer Jane Musky. Baldwin's commentary is the most interesting. He talks about how he got involved with Glengarry GlenRoss and how the actors did not like him because they had already bonded by the time he joined production. The most fascinating part of his audio track is when he talks at length and quite knowledgeably about the craft of acting. After hearing this commentary it is a shame that Baldwin does not do more of these-he is a natural.<br />Also included is a ten-minute segment from The Charlie Rose Show that features Jack Lemmon talking about working on Glengarry GlenRoss and what attracted him to Mamet's work.<br />On the lighter side, there is a funny clip from Inside the Actors Studio featuring Kevin Spacey and a student re-enacting the &quot;Will You Go to Lunch?&quot; scene from the movie.<br />The folks at Artisan have assembled an impressive two-DVD set that is an excellent tribute to Mamet's signature masterpiece..<br />&quot;J.

0446677450|5.0|Before reading Rich Dad Poor Dad I was out of control, letting brokers make my financial decisions for me and letting my employer determine my lifestyle.<br />What I got out of Rich Dad Poor Dad first of all is to think for myself. No broker, financial planner or advisor will take care of my money as well as I will. Point of fact, I once turned over a sizeable amount to a broker and asked him to watch it for me. He must still be watching it because I never saw it again.<br />Employers determine how much we make, when and where were can go on vacation. We work 9-5 and at the end of the week, our employer who has us on a chain, loosens that chain let's us have a little freedom. Once a year (or more depending on how long you have worked for them) your employer reels out that line a little more for something called a vacation. Our employer even determines what kind of retirement or even if we can retire based on pensions and 401 (k) plans all of which are determined by the employer.<br />Thanks to Rich Dad, I found a better way. I determine my own investments and have done quite well thank you. I have started my own super successful business and set up my own retirement plan. I am in control. I also think for myself, something that Kiyosaki learned from his Rich Dad.<br />I used to read certain financial magazines but stopped when I realized that most were just cataloques for certain financial companies and offered very little useable advice. I lost a bundle buying a stock recommended by my broker because it was in (.....) magazine. <br />To sum up Rich Dad Poor Dad, it is the true story of Robert Kiyosaki and his real father who was poor following pretty much the same system that most people do; go to school, get a job etc. and his &quot;Rich Dad&quot;, actually a friends dad who was rich  <BR>but followed a different system, of being an entrepneneur, independent.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is a excellent book to launch you into financial self reliance. It sure worked forme.

So what if most (if not all) of her vocals are computer-enhanced...how many musicians these days don't rely on technology? This album is slick, fast-paced, and expertly produced with something for anyone who likes serious dance pop music. <br />The opening track &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; is still my favorite but the second song &quot;I Got That Boom Boom&quot; with the Yin Yang Twins is fantastic - check out the banjo riffs. Other highlights include &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; (a song worthy Kylie), &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Early Mornin',&quot; and &quot;Brave New Girl.&quot; The album closes with a remix of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; that includes a Bhangra beat and ends the CD on a breathless up note.<br />Between this and Madonna's &quot;American Life,&quot; I'd say American pop music is alive and well in 2003.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Being a huge Godsmack fan myself, I probably would be seen as biased. BUT I love this CD. To me, it is different from their other two. It's an older, grown-up sound and I would recommend this to anyone. It's hard to say which of the songs would be my favorite. I would say Serenity and Realign are my two most favorite ones, but I listen to this CD from start to finish. There's not one song on this CD that I skip over or don't like.<br />Buy this CD! :)  The only thing better than the CD's are their shows. You should check them out when they are in your town. They rock in concert!!!!
6305095442|5.0|Since its release in 1987, writer/director Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2 has garnered somewhat of a cult following among horror enthusiasts.  Notable for its inventive camera shots, campy humor and over-the-top gore, this film is not for the faint of heart, or anyone with an aversion to slapstick humor.<BR> Much like the first film, this semi-sequel (the basic plot mirrors that of the first film) begins with Ash (Bruce Campbell), who is on his way to a secluded cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler).  However, things soon go awry as a nondescript demon takes Linda and transforms her into the walking dead.  After fending off his former lover, Ash discovers that an ancient book was unearthed by an archaeologist who lived in the cabin, and, upon translating the book, an evil spirit with an insatiable thirst for blood and carnage was unleashed.  Now, Ash must fight to protect his life, as well as his sanity.<BR> As a horror film, Evil Dead 2 succeeds on many levels.  First of all, the setting, an isolated cabin, adds palpable tension as Ash struggles to combat the creatures that lurk in the night.  The audience is made to feel as claustrophobic as he must, running from small room to small room, never quite knowing what will pop out next.  When Ash ventures into the woods, the anxiety ratchets up even further, since everyone knows that darkness acts as a blanket for the evil that lurks just beyond the shadows.<BR> Raimi is a virtuoso behind the camera, with skewed perspectives, strange point-of-view shots (like a flying, severed eyeball) and crane shots so manic and wild you could mistake the film for a cartoon.  Upside down, diagonal- the camera seems to be able to move anywhere, and the variety of shots adds a considerable amount of unpredictability and energy to the film.  Raimi is very playful, very enthusiastic, and he does not hesitate to let these qualities bleed into his work.  <BR> Like Raimi, Campbell is a fan of the Three Stooges, and fast-paced, slapstick comedy in general.  And as he proves in a very funny kitchen scene, Cambell is very adept when it comes to physical comedy.  He can make you laugh while you simultaneously wince or simply stare in awe at the amount of viscera that soaks this film.  The insane and often unexpected bits of humor, combined with Cambell's delightful overacting (he is often called the greatest B movie actor of all time) lend the film a unique aspect that makes it seem fresher that many of the ho-hum copycat slasher films that are released today.<BR> Or maybe that freshness simply comes from all the blood of various colors that is being tossed around.  On multiple occasions, the death of a character or severing of a limb result in a startlingly gratuitous spray of blood, which is by turns red, green, blue... a veritable cornucopia of vital juices.  Due to its excessiveness, Raimi and the rest of the crew decided to purposely alter the color of the blood at certain points, offsetting the seriousness of the situation.  It works, despite the fact that your jaw will still drop at a few of the more...body-drenching scenes (don't get too close to that hole in the wall...).<BR> Overall, Evil Dead 2 presents a fresh, interesting and frequently entertaining look at a genre that has recently gotten stale and seemingly refuses to make any progress.  However, if you yearn for the old days, with lower-than-low budgets and improvisational actors, this film is right up your alley.  Fans of the Three Stooges or slapstick comedies such as The Naked Gun will surely be amused by it, and anyone whose thirst wasn't sated in gorefests like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste and Dead Alive will find themselves adequately satisfied.  Fans of quality horror films with copious surprises and thrills need look no further.  As an exemplary...example of a horror films, I give Evil Dead 2 &#61514;&#61514;&#61514;&#61514;, the highest rating possible.<BR>Evil Dead 2, 84 min. 1987<BR>Unrated: extreme violence, gore,language, precarious situations, lame acting<BR>&#61514;&#61514;&#61514;&#61514;
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones is a refreshing artist in the times of listening to really heavy music and the pop syrupy music. She has such a soulful, beautiful voice. <br />My personal tastes vary with music, but I mostly listen to heavier stuff (metal/rock). However, Norah is really a different artist. It's rare to find someone who doesn't sound like the rest. I would recommened Norah's CD to anyone!

B0000CABBW|5.0|Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment has hidden two surprises on its Special Edition DVD of 'Whale Rider' that are not immediately obvious. Here's how to locate them.<BR>From the DVD's Main Menu go to the 'Special Features' and there select the 'TV Spots' menu entry. On the next submenu highlight the menu entry' Special Features' at the bottom of the screen and then press the 'Right' arrow key on your remote control.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Once I listened to Ian Curtis, and found him a very pretentious and moaning soul.  He seemed to be some latter-day poser, mumbling about \\"isolation\\" and \\"love tearing him apart\\" (wonder if it left him in stitches?).  And then, I heard Interpol, and they sounded so much better.  I can't believe Joy Division continues to rip them off so much, although the genius of \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\" certainly begs for the attention of such pretenders as those 80s Mancunian blokes.  It's only a matter of time before Paul Banks rightfully proclaims: \\"we're bigger than Jesus.\\"  And, then, inevitably, his ensemble will craft a TOTBL 2, a double album full of more dance-rock experimentation that will inspire even more plagiarism on the part of Joy Division...but Joy Division will never replicate this sound because they don't turn their guitars up enough and they can't  balance these countermelodies.  Interpol--The New Beatles?
B000002IZ4|5.0|this cd is awesome it starts off with a kick arse song meat plow.....but my fav songs on the cd are interstate love song and BIG EMPTY ( me and my g/f had our first kiss to this song )<BR>i recommend EVERBODY listens to this cd.
0792838068|1.0|This is a piece of junk that smells like TYPICAl hollywood from its very first few seconds. I can't stand watching movies so set out to impress, and so devoid of any emotionality as this. But, what completely shatters whatever hope you have left of the film, is the acting. Cage displays some of the most blatant, and pathetic overacting I have seen in my entire life.At times, watching his overacting was almost funny, but at times it was just gruesome. Shue just seems detached. See, the problem with all these so-called actors, is that I can actually see them acting. The plot is also riduculous. How completely gone do you have to be to agree to let a man you supposedly have feelings for &quot;drink himself to death&quot;??
B00005JMFR|3.0|First off, it is impossible to review this film on it's own, as it is basically a straight continuation of the second film in the series. Second, everything you have heard about the action and effects is understated - the sequences are absolutely brilliant. There, got that over with. Now, there must be a story in here somewhere... OH! got it. Yah. The series is a simplified parable about the various prisons-of-being humans and their progeny end up in. Kudos for making the machines behave as they are supposed to - like advanced machines, not people. The Keymaker and the Architect in particular say some of the dopeyest sounding things, yet taken as coming from an artificial intelligence, suddenly there is an undercurrent flowing through that helps explain exactly why the \\"war\\" between the humans and machines continues. OK, this could be the \\"Arnold\\" excuse for sometimes sub-par acting and poor dialog, but in these films, it isn't. Kudos also for pulling no punches - when telling the story of a savior, well, losses must be taken along the way. The heavier the loss, the greater the dramatic payoff of the resolution. Kudos as well for keeping the nature of what happens completely ambiguous - none of the pontificating poker-faced icons in this film end up being right per se, but they do manage to mature over the arc of the films into actual people. Morpheus, the Oracle,the Architect - none of them have any more clue than the others, and are all slaves to their own contructions/beliefs. Only the One, whose mind is free (and not too sharp, it must be said) is flexible enough to see around all the bumpers in the path to salvation. It was also nice to see Hollywood steal not only the \\"wire-fu\\" effects but some plot complexity from Japanese and Korean film. Kudos Maximus for the Bollywood-dance-number climactic battle for Zion. And for those who bash this film, I can't possibly imagine what they could have done differently to properly wrap up the story. If the ending battles -and the last half of this film is almost wall-to-wall fast action - aren't enough, and the sacrifices made to try and save humanity aren't enough and the \\"leave them thinking about how what happened did in fact happen\\" didn't faze you, well, you better write your own blockbuster. If you can beat this, you'll probably get a movie deal. Keanu Reeves awful acting, or lack thereof, knocks a star off this film. Otherwise, I can't think of a thing I'd change. I would love a sequel, but to do one would be artistically unpardonable. That is the strength of a created world - we want to see more stories in it, even if there are no more to be told. No, I am not giving anything away by writing that, no fear. See and enjoy.
B00000HYXB|5.0|I discovered this album when I was living in a boarding school, being forced to share a room with a guy who incessantly listened to TATU and Britney Spears. By the time I became conceived that today you can hear nothing really good and that music is dead (sentimental, oversugared pop songs aren't music), I stumbled across this album and being a Tolkien fan suspiciously bought it. I think its the best concept album based on Tolkien. This stuff just rocks and forever got me into metal. Here is a song by song description:<br />Into The Storm: Thunderous, fast metal. Catchy chorus. About Morgoth fighting with Ungoliant over the Silmarils.<br />Nightfall: Very slow and melodic. One of the best songs on the album. Got that uniqe mediaeval feeling to it. Tells about the darkening of Valinor<br />The Curse Of Feanor: An atrocious song of vengeance. A great song. In a way reminds of Iced Earth's &quot;Dracula&quot;. Feanor realizes that all he has done turned against him and swears eternal revenge on the dark lord.<br />Blood Tears: Slow and sad ballad. About Maeglin being caught and tortured by Morgoth.<br />Mirror, Mirror: A metal masterpiece. The music got a strange, happy sound to it. Great chorus. I think its about Ulmo's warning to Turgon and the building of Gondolin.<br />Time Stands Still: Very epic stuff. About Fingolgin's duel with the dark lord. One of my favourites.<br />Noldor: Another masterpiece. Sad but catchy. Describing the exodus of the Elved from Valinor.<br />Thorn: This song got kind of a dark, enchanted feeling about it. Good stuff. <br />The Eldar: Hansi's best vocal performance. Great song. About the death of Fingolfin in Sauron's dungeons.<br />When Sorrow Sang: One of the few love songs I actually liked. Sweet chorus. Tells about the love of Beren and Luthien.<br />A Dark Passage: In your face song about the triumph of Morgoth when he nearly succeeds in wiping out the elves and men and the little hope that is left. <br />In short: this is musical masterpiece with a uniqe dark and epic feeling about it. If you like good music stop reading and buy it.
0790729369|4.0|Yep, another guy here writing about this movie....what got me is that it feels very realistic. Meryl Streep's character is so amazing in the Bridges of Madison County. Seeing her come alive because of her passion for Eastwood is so gripping. This movie reminds me that real love comes around so few times in life, but when it does, you must pounce on it before it gets away!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|As many of the DVDs now are produced, Reloaded has gorgeous film- to- DVD transfer for both video and audio quality. Make sure your speakers are strong, or you may blow them out! And if they are great, don't crank it so loud that the neighbors can hear it as well.<br />I too felt let down by the movie's plot. Many special effects seemed made simply to blow stuff up. And the relationship between Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) didn't seem believable. Yet I found myself watching Reloaded several times. Seems I like to pick it up when I need some adrenaline kicks inside, and some of the scenes truly deliver. Maybe the producers got too greedy.... Reloaded, however, didn't seem like a waste of effort and film when I started looking at it as a film on its own merits. I stepped away from my first Matrix DVD, not watching it for a while so I could make a better attempt at not moving towards comparing the two. When I did, I enjoyed Reloaded more. It's decent, but not a really nice movie, which is why I stopped short of giving it 4 stars.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I have waited many years for Sarah to record a new cd and she didn't let us down.&quot;Afterglow&quot; is not &quot;Surfacing&quot; or her other cds but it's still a great disc.Her voice is still haunting and beautiful.&quot;Fallen&quot; is a great single.I'm so glad Sarah is back.This cd will not disappoint her fans.
B000127LW2|5.0|I have waited in anticipation for this moment. I am sure that is true of many fellow trekkers. I have enjoyed the lot on VHS and come Feb we [trekkers and all others who'd enjoyed or would enjoy this saga] could all partake in the eventful, bittersweet and heartfelt journey of Voyager in its most basic of quest... the quest to come home...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is a fun cd.  Lots of hints of Madonna throughout the entire cd.  Its good for a sunny, top down in the jeep, lip gloss wearing, girl pal, hitting the streets type of music.  You can hear a difference in Brits voice.  She sounds much more mature.  Tons o' fun!
B000008MBO|4.0|If you think Mary Chapin Carpenter(Passionate Kisses) and Tom Petty(Changed the Locks) were good, you should hear the originals.  &quot;Lucinda Williams&quot; is the album that builds up to deliver the greats - &quot;Car Wheels,&quot; &quot;Essence,&quot; and &quot;World Without Tears.&quot;  Any serious Lucinda Williams fan will own this cd.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think this really is the best album I have bought this year, and the best album from Britney. It is totally addictive, with every song unique and fresh. Toxic, me against the music, ive got that boom boom and showdown are all really funky. The slower ballads, Everytime and Shadow are just beautiful to listen to. Touch of my hand and breathe on me are entrancing! Britney sounds amazing in all the songs - her voice is so easy and charming to listen to.<br />My summary of the whole album is that there is something for everyone, and that you wont be able to stop listening from beginning to end! I love it and have listened to it everyday since I bought it. Every time I listen, I just cannot make my mind up which song I like best - this album has a totally new feel to it with regards most of the latest offerings from the music world. Ignore what the critics say about this album - they are being far too harsh on Britney. This album illustrates the fact that she is the best at what she does, and is going to rock the music industry once again!
B000000WJ2|4.0|When Mick Jagger listened to Keith Richards' first solo album said that the sound of the drums was too loud. I am not sure that that was true with regard to Talk is Cheap (1988), but it is certainly true with regard to Main Offender (Keith's second studio album, released in 1992).<BR>The record is nice and there are several nice songs. My favorite ones are Eileen, Hate it When You Leave and, above all, Words of Wonder, which shows that Keith Richards is an extraordinary reggae musician. <BR>Main Offender is not as good, as interesting, as intense as Talk is Cheap had been few years before. But it is certainly a record worth listening to.
B0000TB03W|4.0|She is so totally awesome in this DVD. I love her so much. I cannot stop watching this DVD because I love every song in it. I am so glad that she released it. The opening songs just totally rocks and takes you into her great live performance.
6305754969|4.0|El Dorado is basically a remake of 1959's Rio Bravo with Robert Mitchum playing the Dean Martin Role and James Caan playing the Rick Nelson role as a young gunman.  The Trio are joined by Mitchums deputy &quot;Bull&quot; in trying to protect a family of rancers from an evil land baron trying to run them off their land.<br />It's classic Wayne with lots of humor mixed in with the action.  Wayne and Mitchum were very good together and Mitchums scenes playing the drunken sheriff are very funny.<br />Ed Asner plays the evil land baron with Christopher George as his hired gunslinger who wants to challenge the older Wayne to see who is faster on the draw.<br />Not as good as Rio Bravo but better than Rio Lobo which was basically yet another re-make of the same plot.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Only Shania could preform with the joy and talent shown in this DVD. She has proved she loves her fans and wants to be in front of them with great music. Great music is just what is here in this DVD. She is a powerful person and preformer.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|&quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Let it Be&quot; are better without the Spector schlock, and that's probably the reason why McCartney went ahead with the project. It's burned at him for years that his work was altered like it was by Spector, and without his consent. It could stand to reason that he waited for George's death to finally correct the mistake, but whatever, this is a mixed bag.  Pauls' material is better. The rest, not so.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania fans are going to enjoy this DVD! She sings all of her hits and some new songs from the UP album that she performs live in this Chicago concert. She interacts with her fans that she even invite a few fans to sing and dance on stage with her. This is a must have for any Shania fan!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|George must have smiled when he heard Paul sing two of his tunes, &quot;For You Blue,&quot; and &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; Macca barely had time to spend on Harrison's songs, nor did he consider him an equal (to be fair, neither did Lennon). Still, Paul did an admirable job on the two above mentioned tunes (I will omit &quot;Something&quot; on the ukelele, as it was more of a novelty).<br />Great performance from George's buds. Dhani looks so much like his dad that it's scary. He even acts like him while playing guitar.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Go and get this DVD now. It is totally awesome. She is one of the best performers out there. She totally deserves all the awards she wins and this show proves that she can sure sing!
079073804X|4.0|I must say that the extra scene of Regan on the stairs made the hairs on the back of my neck stand. Some people found that scene comical or out-of-step with the movie, but I thought it was chilling. This is a classic.
B0000TB03W|4.0|This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD does not know what they are missing!! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special so you are in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there is no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert! Shania definitely rocked this country the night of that concert!!
B00007K08H|5.0|I use Am&eacute;lie to teach film techniques in my high school mass media class.  The movie can be separated into vignettes and the color, light, sound, camera angles, and editing are made for film analysis.<br />It has some sexy bits (eight-second 15-orgasm scene and the porn palace), but it's not too embarrassing to show to seniors.<br />The film has a positive, uplifting message that's told with good humor.  Most of my kids (who hate subtitles) like this movie despite having to read it.  Many even buy it.

Yes, it's set in space while giving us the great myth of the old west and it does this seamlessly.  You don't doubt what you are hearing or seeing, you marvel at it.  The DVD is filled with a group of engaging outcasts making their way through space in a post war period wanting to be legal but always on the edge....let's face it, they're rustlers.  Engaging rustlers you'd want to join.  This DVD is priceless.
B00000AFWW|4.0|A lot of people said that Hole sold out with this album, but if you approach it by not comparing it to LIVE THROUGH THIS, you'll find a good album. If you do compare, then of course you will be disapointed. There was never going to be a LTT part 2. I really enjoy CELEBRITY SKIN, I think it's a great album. Too bad it was the last from Hole. The title track is an obvious standout. &quot;Awful&quot; is my personal favorite from the album, it just rocks plain and simple. &quot;Hit So Hard&quot;, &quot;Playing Your Song&quot;, &quot;Malibu&quot; and &quot;Dying&quot; are other great highlights for me from the set. Overall a pretty well rounded album!
B00009V7T2|4.0|This is a truly mind-boggling record, very techical, structurally advance, progressive post-punk rock. I really need to listen to a bit more to give a considered opinion on. But let it be said that jon theodore is one heck of a drummer. For trivia's sake, it should be noted that Chili Pepper's bassist Flea plays on most, if not all of this album, but he keeps a fairly low profile.
0790729652|5.0|BATMAN is one of the best movies of all time. It is also the best of the Batman series. Jack Nicholson does a tremendous job as The Joker. Michael Keaton does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman. This movie is action packed, funny, and very well done. I strongly recommend you buy this movie. I also recommend you buy BATMAN RETURNS in addition to this movie. You won't regret I gaurantee.
B00003CXI1|4.0|A film by Chris Columbus<br />This is the first film in the Harry Potter series and it is adapted from J.K. Rowling's novel of the same title.  A common complaint about movies that have been adapted from a book is that the movie strays too far from the book and that it makes too many changes.  This is sometimes necessary as film and novels are two different mediums and need to tell stories in different ways, but sometimes unnecessary changes are made.  Happily, this is not the case with this movie.  This movie is extremely faithful to the book, and I think the film works because of that.<br />By now, many people probably have a good idea what Harry Potter is all about.  For those who are not in the know, here's the story for this movie.  Young Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is living with his aunt and his uncle because his parents died when he was an infant.  It is obvious they do not want him around as he is forced to live in the closet under the stairs and he is treated like a servant, an unwelcome servant at that.  One day owls start arriving at the house and deliver letters to Harry.  We see that the letters are from &quot;Hogwarts.&quot;  Harry's uncle keeps destroying the letters, but more come each day.  Finally he has had enough and Harry's Uncle takes the family (including Harry) to a remote island where no letters can reach them.  It is at this point that Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) finds Harry, tells him that Harry is a wizard, and that he is to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  See, Harry is a wizard, and is the son of a wizard.  Harry's parents were not killed in a car accident (as he had been told), but rather they were killed by the Dark Lord Voldemort, a wizard gone bad.  Harry is the boy who lived, which is why he is famous in the wizarding world.<br />At Hogwarts, Harry makes friends with Ron Weasely (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and makes an enemy of Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  Ron and Hermione are also first year students and are in Gryffindor House with Harry.  Draco is also a first year, but is in Slytherin House (Ron tells Harry that &quot;not a wizard went bad that wasn't in Slytherin&quot;).  Harry, Ron, and Hermione become good friends and get into little adventures together.

B000008LOV|5.0|This CD is the ultimite collaborations of any superstars of all time.  This is ubelievable work that can only be described and buying at the great price Amazon offers. You won't regret it.  Roy hits some uncunning and unthinkable notes that no one else in the world can touch.  Dylan's lyrics as usual are great. Harrison's guitar lick still prove to be the best.  You can't go wrong with this CD, it won't leave your player once you hit play.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I bought this disc out of curiosity after seeing Britney's ABC special - prior to this purchase, the only &quot;teen pop&quot; person out of that 1998-1999 batch that I paid any attention to was Christina Aguilera.  The cd has not left my car cd player since I got it on Friday.<br />I really liked Toxic and Breathe on Me and thought for $9, it couldn't be worse than a lot of other artists' cds I've bought this year.  I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised.  My fav tracks are Me Against the Music, I Got That Boom Boom, Breathe on Me, Toxic, Outrageous, Touch of My Hand, The Hook-Up &amp; Everytime.<br />I compare this disc to Paula Abdul's first, Madonna, Pebbles or Jody Watley - none of them were vocal heavyweights yet made fun, danceable music with catchy lyrics which is exactly what I look for in pop music.<br />I personally don't understand the personal attacks on this girl in some of these reviews but maybe it's because I view certain &quot;singers&quot; as performers not singers so when I pay money to see them in concert, I know that I will be seeing a lip-synched performance primarily (these people are J-Lo &amp; Janet Jackson).  Frankly, I wouldn't want these people to try to sing live too much because with all of their dancing, it sound horrible when they try to sing as well so the people who trash this girl may want to ask, do I want to see Brit dance or do I want to hear her sing??
B0000DJZA5|2.0|This is the best Beatles release since they ceased to exist.  The original album was a soundtrack to a film.  This is an album.<BR>   Do yourself a favor...
B00005JM02|5.0|This is my favorite film of the year!  I went to see it three times in the theater, and then got the DVD the first day.  I love the characters, the storyline, and the animation.  It is truly a remarkable film, and one that the entire family can enjoy.  It touches on basic hearttouching themes like family, friendship, and the importance of trust, loyalty, and hope.  These are great things!  And the jokes are such that there are things for the kids and things for adults.  Albert Brooks and Ellen Degeneres in the leading roles are superb with their voices that really bring the characters to life.<br />The DVD has many special features, like exploring the reef (a remarkable virtual place!) and read-alongs and games, but perhaps the most fun are the virtual aquariums.  These can be left on the television for hours, a sort of screen saver for the television.  My cat loves the movement of the aquarium, and I see her frequently staring at the screen.<br />It is always fun to see the behind the scenes, the truly wonderful technology and artistry that went into making this movie which is destined to become a classic of children's film.<br />Also fun is the short film Knick Knack -- I saw this in the theater too, and am glad to have a copy now.<br />Buy it today!  Watch it forever!
B00006AW2G|5.0|Let It Bleed is without a doubt my &quot;personal favorite&quot; Rolling Stones LP!  There's a little bit of everything on this one.  Mick Jagger is at his best vocally. Keith Richards, at his best on guitar and the rest of the band is just TIGHT!!  The Stones were (as far as I'm concerned) at their peak!!  If you're a new Rolling Stones fan and considering where to start yuour collection .... LOOK NO FURTHER .... START WITH LET IT BLEED!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Only Shania could preform with the joy and talent shown in this DVD. She has proved she loves her fans and wants to be in front of them with great music. Great music is just what is here in this DVD. She pulls out all the stops and lets it go with Shes not just another pretty face and the many other songs. She is a powerful person and preformer.
B00008IAMD|5.0|This was the last album released during Johnny Cash's lifetime, although I know he was working on an album at the time of his death, so I wouldn't be surprised to see [[ASIN:B002PLALCE American V]] eventually released. Cash's voice had suffered some damage at this point in his life. He had trouble holding notes at some times. But the imperfections in his voice work within the context of this album. This is an acoustic album, with very sparse arrangements. Many of the songs here are about pain and regret, and I sometimes get choked up listening to them. \\"Hurt\\", \\"Give My Love to Rose\\", \\"I Hung My Head\\" and \\"Danny Boy\\" bring tears to my eyes. This is an excellent album. God bless Johnny Cash.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania shows how much life she has when she is on stage. With this DVD of songs she can shine as the star she is. She moves and works the fans with outstanding music and ability to sing the songs. With her talent and ability she can create an atomsphere of joy, sorrow, love and happiness all be her singing.
B000084T18|1.0|THIS IS NOT A DEBUT.  50 cent has always sucked, and nothing has changed, except his beats (compliments of Dre). Terrible rapping, terrible lyrics <br />&quot;Shorty she so fine, I gotta make her mine<BR>A ass like dat gotta be one of a kind<BR>I crush 'em everytime, punch 'em with every line<BR>I'm f**kin with they mind<BR>I make 'em press rewind<BR>They know they can't shine if I'm around the rhyme<BR>Been on parole since 94 cause I commit tha crime<BR>I send you my line, I did it three ta nine<BR>If D's ran up in my crib, you know who droppin dimes&quot; <br />--SHUT THE F**K UP--
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is up and alive in this DVD. She walks down to the fans and lets one sing a bit. It shows her love and willingness to be with the fans. The songs have more energy and she seems to be more alive and fill of energy in this preformance. She shows the reason she is a true Diva and Super  Star. I would recommand this DVD for everyone.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|How sad that people can judge Brit's CD without even listening to it. People who are reviewing the CD here, I'm sure most giving it one star has not even heard half of the tracks. People judge Britney on the way she dresses and the way she acts on stage, and also the countless amount of rumors that the tabloids and every other magazine likes to write about Britney. The truth is, music isn't all about the vocals, and to judge Brit on her vocals only is a sad thing. Why would people listen to Mozart and Chopin if music is all about vocals? <br />Truth be told, this is probably one the best POP albums you'll ever be able to buy. Britney has done it again. I am a Britney fan, but to be honest I did not like her past albums [besides Oops... I Did it Again]. This album shows the versatality Britney has and how she can pull off just about every type of genre of music there is. If you are looking for a CD to buy now, or you happen to be a store that sells the Brit CD, get it right away. Brit's past songs might disappoint, but the new LP won't.
B0000TB05A|5.0|So many events conspired to make this show truly unique. Slane Castle has been host to Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Guns n' Roses, Thin Lizzy, Queen, Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers (this year, and whose Slane DVD is due 1 week after this one) but was never headlined by U2 until 2001. <br />2 other events that make this show equally jubilant and emotional is fact the Bono was in mourning over the death of his father. The funeral was the eve of the first Slane show the week before. However, the truly magnificent event that had the crowd on a high all day was the World cup qualifier held that afternoon in Dublin. The 2nd half of the match was screened to the Slane audience.<br />These 2 events are so apparent during a lot of the banter with the crowd. 'Kite' is dedicated to his father Bob Hewson, Bono changes the words of beautiful day to 'beautiful goal' in reference to Jason Mc Ateer's wonder goal. (He did dedicate 'One' to Jason Mc Ateer, but this was edited out for one reason or another, most obvious one being the scope of Mc Ateer's fame, the other may have been an attempt to ease the suffering of Dutch U2 fans).<br />Other highlights include, Sunday Bloody Sunday, in which Bono recalls the names of the victims of the 1998 Omagh bombing. This is quite powerful as it helps to humanise the victims instead of making them statistics of a bloody outrage. The Boyne river, scene of the famous divisive 1690 battle in the background makes the message even more potent and relevant. Bullet the blue sky is brilliant. The introduction by Sinead O Connor is inspired. However they did leave out the Charlton Heston footage at the end of the song.<br />The only cringe-worthy shot is Bono's Ireland flag waving moment, however considering the days events, he does go out of his way to explain its 'just once, just once for Jason Mc Ateer' and not some jingoistic retarded nationalistic gesture. 'Mysterious ways' was taken from the main track selection and placed onthe DVD as a bonus track. No idea why, but its a great tune made all the better by Bono's daughter accompanying him on stage. Likewise he dedicates 'All I want is you' to his wife Ali. Bono also summons up their early days with a rendition of their first single 'Out of control'. During which he recounts the story of raising the 2000 pounds necessary to fund the band and how the band decided to stay and live in Dublin with 'the tribe'. <br />This is a truly unique, excellent and uplifting DVD that all U2 fans will enjoy and which U2 themselves will find difficult to replicate again.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|As an older man, Boston, Chicago, REO Speedwagon were my groups. This album has the old-time feel but really rocks. It's not too hard and not too soft. Its right for driving or a great relax song. I would HIGHLY recommend this to any person who wants a GOOD CD. 5 stars, two thumbs up, What ever you use to say the best. I would use that.
B0000CFW87|5.0|The talented Mr. Groban has managed to produce another collection of beautiful music.  It's rare for music to move me to tears, but some of his songs did it.  I especially loved &quot;When You Say You Love Me&quot; and &quot;All' Improvviso Amore&quot;, but the entire CD is wonderful.  I highly recommend it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This extended edition is superior to the theatrical release.  The extra forty minutes or so really do add a lot to the story.  Too bad we can't see it on the big screen yet.  This extended edition also has four disks that are full of not only the movie but many other features on the making of the movie and aspects of the story.<br />While we all wish there were some magical way to see in movie form the experience we had while reading the book that would require each of us to make our own movie.  I am very pleased with what is here and glad for this trilogy being told in such a grand way.<br />Sometimes the movie drifts a bit too close to being a sword and sorcery epic for my tastes, and The Lord of the Rings is definitely NOT that.  Yes, it has magic, and battles, and enchanted figures.  But it is a story about some big human issues first and last that is told on the backdrop of magic and swords.  It is a beautiful story and has had a powerful impact on the lives of many who read it.  I think the movie does as good a job with these wonderful books as you can expect from Hollywood.  Maybe someday they will do them better, but of the attempts in my lifetime, this is the best.<br />Now, they could have provided the theatrical release as well, but I think they want you to buy that separately if you want that.  However, there is a handy booklet that points out the extended and new scenes.  But it really isn't possible to reconstruct the theatrical release from this package.  But I can't think of why I would want to.<br />Enjoy!
B00005JMFO|4.0|Love Actually is about love. All kinds of love. First love, lost love, unrequited love, parent-child love, betrayed love and more. The fact that all the characters are connected somehow makes it very interesting, although sometimes confusing.<br />I expected a pure romantic comedy but was pleasantly surprised at the depth of the film. Yes, there's romance and lots of comedy but there are also some sad and bittersweet moments.<br />The cast is amazing and seem perfectly suited to their roles. The soundtrack is fantastic, as well.<br />If you want a feel-good movie for the holiday weekend, Love Actually should fit the bill.
B000002G7G|5.0|I almost always find myself saying after I listen to the Velvet Underground's self titled 3rd album, that it is their best. However, it is hard to beat &quot;Velvet Underground and Nico.&quot; This album finds as any other review will tell you, The Velvet Underground returning to a softer side after &quot;White Light/White Heat.&quot; It is melodic, pretty, simple but still manages to keep a little distortion and experimentation. The lyrics move from social and &quot;avant-garde&quot; to more personal and reflective. My favorite songs are: &quot;What Goes On,&quot; &quot;Pale Blue Eyes,&quot;I'm Set Free,&quot; &quot;The Murder Mystery,&quot; and &quot;Afterhours.&quot; There is not one filler on this album. This album and &quot;The Velvet Underground and Nico&quot; were two of the best albums to come out of the 60s. The music is timless and is always playing on my stereo. Whenever I make a mix tape, a song from this album 90% of the time makes it on the tape. I am always winning over people by playing this record and would consider it one of my favorites of all-time. A must have in any music collection.
B000000WCV|5.0|I remember first seeing the music videos for &quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Around the World&quot; on MTV (believe it or not) several years ago and just being completely blown away by the infectious dance beats. &quot;Around the World&quot; in particular really grabbed me by the jugular. It is by far the catchiest dance song I have heard in the past decade, next to Kylie Minogue's &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;. The bass-heavy beat is incredible. Listening to &quot;Around the World&quot; brings back memories of me dancing (drunkenly) to this song in the nightclubs back in my college days. &quot;Da Funk&quot; was and still is equally cool in its own right. It is extremely catchy. I just love the synthesized beats. Just like &quot;Around the World&quot;, &quot;Da Funk&quot; has that incredible deep bass hook that gets you on the dancefloor. As much as I love Daft Punk's follow up &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Homework&quot; has to be my favorite of the two cds. Granted that &quot;Homework&quot; lacks the warmth of &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Homework&quot; has a raw, live feel that its predecessor lacked. &quot;Revolution 909&quot; reminds me of something I have heard during my journeys to Chicago back in the day and my friends and I would be cruising to our favorite nightclub with the radio cranked up, and this song would be on the airwaves (more like a song with the same beat). I also love the shimmering techno track &quot;Indo Silver Club&quot; as well. Despite being seven years old, &quot;Homework&quot; still holds up to this very day which is not an easy task to do because trends comes and goes in dance music but &quot;Homework&quot; is an exception to that rule and it still sounds fresh and new to me.
B00003CXSP|5.0|Viewed as a separate entity and not a sequel,&quot;Hannibal&quot; is easily one of the greatest films of the last decade. Shot partially in Florence, Italy, this gorgeous, pristine production is a movie and a half. Director Ridley Scott doesn't just film these lovely vignettes as much as he caresses every scene with his camera and paces the movie so perfectly it almost lulls you until another scene of horrifying violence occurs. Anthony Hopkins is the most convincing monster ever seen on film and is impossible not to watch, this man is an actor's actor. Whenever Dr. Lecter appears on screen, you listen carefully to every word he utters and can't wait to see what happens next. The most brilliant thing about the film is the tension throughout, you just keep FEELING like something terrible is about to happen and that's scarier than anything you actually see. Julianne Moore is a great choice for Clarice Starling, she lends the character a cynicism, toughness and world weariness that comes with a decade of service in the F.B.I., this is a mature, smart Clarice and her development and growth is a marvel to behold. Much has been made of the violence in this film and while &quot;Hannibal&quot; is quite graphic at times, it's not the unwatchable gore-fest people have made it out to be. The second disc of special features is indespensible, a veritable feast of interviews, deleted scenes, movie premiere featurettes, special effects documentarties, a terrific Director's commentary and a host of other bells and whistles. This is how a DVD should be done. The total package; film, cast, direction and extras are all flawless. A must-have for any film library
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I  must say that  I  am not  Britney fan. I  have  bought  her albums   as  gifts for  my nieces  and  have listened  to them and  thought that they were  fun  music   for  someone  their age. They  are fun  to listen to dance to and great road  trip  sound. However  this  album  quite  surprised me.  I  do truly enjoy it. Yes  she  doesn't have    great voice, but  her  voice  is   nice and  certainly  is  just   right  for the kind of  music she performs,  so I don't see reasons  to say  anything bad about her voice.  Especially when there are  alot  of  very well respected bands  whos  singer   don't have  voices at all. Am I not right?   I gues  the only  thing I truly hate about this album  are the Ying Yang twins.  But it  is only my personal oppinion. My   fav tracks  are   3,4,10,8,  of course i  do actually like   all f them except   2  and not so found  of the  repetitious 7.  Britney has  certainly not  dissapointed me.   Fresh new  sound  and  hopefully, she will  continue to grow.
0671042858|3.0|King wrote an earlier book about a woman that was accidently chained to a bed in a log cabin (he's written so many that I forgot the name).  In it the woman struggles to survive and escape from her bonds.  While doing this she has time to examine her own life and realize a great deal about herself.  Well in this book, instead of a woman we have a girl (Trisha) and instead of being chained to a bed, she is lost in the woods.  While trying to survive and reach civilization, Trisha also examines her life and starts to realize a lot of things about herself.  While doing that she fantasizes about Tom Gordon, a relief pitcher for the Red Sox.  Sometimes she imagines seeing him and getting advice from his image.  I think because King is such a big Red Sox fan that he needed to put together something with the Red Sox.<br />The books tends to drag a little past the middle.  I might have rated this book a little higher had I not read the first book (which I thought was a lot better).
0767812387|3.0|I enjoy this show, but as a ballroom dancer, this movie did have a lot of problems.  The competition scene itself was hopelessly off. If you're going to display a ballroom competition, at LEAST get it right! The comp they showed is nothing like a real competition, you get nothing of the real feel of what ballroom is. Someone looking to get hooked on the dance style will be sorely disappointed if that's what they're expecting. There's a lot more to it than this movie shows. More to the point, I'd like to see a ballroom movie that employs REAL ballroom dancers, people who actually know what they're doing. That could bring a whole new kind of charisma to the screen. Other than that, though...the music was incredible, very dance-able, it made me want to get out and samba the night away. The story was only halfway, and sort of muddy at times, like they were trying to put TOO much into it, but not too bad. Still, give me Strictly Ballroom any day.
B00003CXGP|4.0|I didn't read the book but have heard that the book is similiar but with obviously more detail, especially with grotesque murder, death scenes and cynical rants on yuppie culture. However, most people who like this movie understand it as a comedy/satire ripping on the cheesy yuppie subculture. I would imagine a lot of people who don't like this movie probably embrace yuppie garbage and 80's pop culture. However, to anyone who dislikes the yuppie stereotype, cheesy fake people, excesssively bad 80's music, style, and values...then you will like this movie. It's really, really funny if it is not taken as a thriller or serious commentary. But if you dont' find it funny, you probably are braindead, offeneded, or just a clueless yuppie in your BMW on your way to Riverdance
B000002V07|4.0|&quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; is another cd I haven't listened to in a few years that I thought I would throw into my stereo. I have always loved the haunting ballad &quot;Fade into You&quot;. I guess Mazzy Star is what a lot of people would consider to be shoegazer. The music is mellow and soothing to relax to. Now that I am listening to the cd for the first time in 2-3 years, I find myself completely enjoying the music much more than I initially did. Hope Sandoval has that little girl voice which isn't a bad thing. She obviously left an influence in music, namely with Allison Shaw of the band Cranes and maybe a little with Sharin Foo of The Raveonettes. I still don't care for the tracks &quot;Mary of Silence&quot; and &quot;Five String Serenade&quot;. Maybe because of the lack of melody and Hope Sandoval's monotonous vocals is what turns me off from the song. I love the acoustic guitar on the latter track but there isn't a real sense of melody or emotions in either song. I still think that the best tracks on the cd are &quot;Fade Into You&quot;, &quot;Bells Ring&quot;, and &quot;Blue Light&quot;. I particularly enjoyed the gospel influence in &quot;Blue Light&quot;. Hope's vocals actually doesn't sound so monotonous on this track. Although not perfect, &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; is still a solid album to chill out to after a long day at the office.
B000075BFK|1.0|I heard these songs back in 1996 on bootleg Makaveli tapes in California and I wish I still had them because the beats were different than the wack production I'm hearing on this trash. The bootlegs had beats that were probably the original tracks Tupac had for these songs and they were tight as hell. What you get on this mainstream version is pure garbage. Tupac would have never used these beats for ANY song. He's cursing these niccas out in his grave for mutilating his songs. I broke this CD into a million pieces. This is not Pac!
0385334206|5.0|&quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; was Kurt Vonnegut's birthday present to himself as he reached the half-century mark.  How gracious of him to share this purging with the reading public.  Dark, disturbing, and hilarious, this novel stands among the finest of the previous century.  Courage.  Bravo, Mr. Vonnegut.
0061091480|5.0|Years a go a heart broken lady told me that the book gave her a new life. I immediately bought the book and was positively surprised how interesting and helpful this book is!
B0000CAQ27|1.0|This album sounds like someone took a bunch of glam rock songs from the 80's and tried to update them for 2003.  Well, they failed.  Bleah!  I sure wish I had listened to this album before I bought it.
0743201140|5.0|I thought I'd place my premature evaluation. I call it premature because I have only reached chapter 5 thus far. This book is definitely refreshing - like a tall glass of lemonade on a hot summer day. I was intrigued most by the idea of a new paradigm in the area of improvement - focus on your strengths for improvement and not your weakness (as much) - so simple, yet so valuable. I would say the online exam is worth the price of the book. For me, I found it to be very accurate. Within the framework of this book, I have had the opportunity to reflect and see my strengths in my past interactions - VERY EMPOWERING. This book encourages you to be yourself (the best way you know how) because you have a mix of greatness that is unique to you. Here is your chance to know thy self. Enjoy.
B0000048V8|5.0|Whoa! Who could imagine that a little, world-less children's book could have been turned in such an amazing little film. &quot;The Snowman&quot; from start to finish is breath taking, the animation is the most beautiful pencil drawn style ever and the music is outstanding. Just like in Raymond's book, this film doesn't have any dialogue, just one song, which by the way has to be one of the most beautiful melodies ever created, that song is 'Walking in the Air'. The plot of the film is simply, a little boy's snowman comes to life one Christmas night and takes him into a midnight adventure of winter wonderland. This film is a great film to play during the winter holidays, certainly not a film you can watch over and over all year long, but sure comes fresh out of the box each Christmas.
B00005QK3W|5.0|Macca made a fantastic album with a few unfortunate mistakes. In fact I wanted to give it 4 and a half stars, but I thought then I would be nice and give it 5 instead of 4. So, the highlights:<BR>- Rinse The Raindrops!!! This one made me forgive those mistakes. An incredible \\"primal scream\\" song. When I first heard it, it shocked and rocked me. Great thing Macca still can make such masterpieces (a masterpiece it is!). Fantastic guitars, bass and everytihng's perfect! Agree with those who compared it to 'I Want You'. I think I'm beginning to be obsessed by it.<BR>- The musicians. Paul has gathered a wonderful band. Rusty with the guitars and Abe with the drums do an excellent work! (O.k.,  on most of his albums there are masterful musicians, but I like the new mates, anyway :))<BR>- Orchestration is fortunately all right. Old Macca-songs were often spoiled by the terrible instrumentation, but this time, as on 'Flmaing Pie', he does it good.<BR>- Other highlight songs are: the rocking 'Lonely Raod' and 'About You', 'Heather' (beautiful melody) and 'Your Loving Flame' (classic McCartney ballad).<BR>And now the shady part:<BR>- Spinning On An Axis, is really awful! I mean, surely there're some people who like it, but it's not Macca, and I'm simply averse from hip-hop or that terrible rap crap. Sorry, Sir Paul, you got wrong this time.<BR>- The vocals are a few times really weak. I'm sure with a bit more polishing it would also be fine.<BR>- ?The lyrics? For heaven's sake, I think they're not that bad. We know what he wants to say. And simplicity doesn't always mean primitivity. (Remember what criticism did Lennon get for the lyrics of 'I Want You'? But his response was that you can create up to par music without poetic words and that he had said all he had wanted with the song.)<BR>In general I'm very satisfied with this album, it ROCKS and when I listen to it, I always get my hope back that there is still REAL music in this teeniepop-ruled world. (in fact, I'm also considered to be a teenager with the age of 16, but I don't feel like a typical teenie - fortunately)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Amazing cd! If you are looking for something to just turn up really loud in the car, this is it. Songs thats make you wanna get up and dance, the energy is amazing. She goes from hip-hop to techno to indian/asian sounds all the way back to jamaican rythms. Its really great and worth your money.
B000068QKT|5.0|I watched this movie by accident. I was killing time. Soon, I found myself riveted to the movie.<BR>It is a beautiful and sweet story. The story made me feel like a 14 year old falling in love. I am not going to go over the plot - I am going to talk about feelings. I felt light - as if a weight had been taken off my shoulders. My eyes got misty. That hasn't happened for the last 20 years. I was left with a smile and I went to sleep peacefully. This is a MUST WATCH!!

B00009TB5G|5.0|I walked out into the light and am blinking my eyes.  I have spent the last six days watching the Extended The Two Towers DVD.  If you were pondering the worth of this DVD, it IS worth it.<br />My biggest problem with the Theatrical version of TTT were the Ents.  They didn't seem to play as significant of a role in the film as they did in the book.  I think they had maybe three or four scenes before the final battle.  In the Extended version, this is fixed.  The Ents, Merry, and Pippin now all have enough screen time to make them all present and memorable in the movie.  More than any of the other extras, this is what made the film infinitely better for me.<br />I watched the Theatrical version so many times in the theater that, at first, some of the added scenes seemed a little out of place.  No worries.  By the time I finished my second viewing of it, the changes seemed very natural.<br />The commentary with Peter, Philippa, and Fran is wonderful.  A lot of \\"purists\\" complain about plot and character changes.  If you listen to the commentary, the writers/directors had wonderful justifications for the changes they made.  Most of the character changes were made to add dramatic tension.  Some plot points were changed simply due to lack of time/budget.  I think the changes are well reasoned and, for myself, the explanations given are good enough.  (In fact, the only bits I don't like are not even plot changes.  I'm still bugged by the \\"olympic torch orc\\" and the \\"surfing Legalos\\".  That was just silly.)<br />I loved the theatrical version of this film.  I adore the new DVD version.  I didn't think I could possibly like a movie more than this one...until I watched the second and third disc.  Normally, I don't like \\"Behind the Scenes\\" bits.  To me, they can ruin a movie.  Often times I'll learn something like a castle or a space ship is a model.  Then, when I go back and see the film, I'll always see the castle or spaceship as a model.<br />Not in this case.  The Behindthe Scenes section made me gain even more respect for this movie.  What I thought was CG was a model.  What I thought was a model was a set.  What I thought was a mat painting was real.  Seeing everyone on the effects crews working their fingers, quite literally, to the bone in order to give the audience a fantastic and detailed presentation was impressive.  The detail they went through for something that may be on screen for less than two seconds was mind numbing.  Detail so fine, and perfect, that the viewer won't even notice it most of the time.  Such as the inlays on the inside of Theodin's armor.  The inside!?!?  I had thought that Barad Dur (the Dark Tower) was CG.  Seeing them create the over 20 foot model with minute detail to be shot for but a few seconds...it was nothing short of amazing.  Examples like that really give the viewer the impression that the people working on this film were: 1) doing something they loved, 2) really cared about the audience and the end product, and 3) wanted to produce something that would last and they could be proud of.  It was inspiring to watch these people under pressure, literally until the minute before the film was due, to give us the best product they could, under the circumstances.<br />If you own any DVD, get this one.  It has me salivating for Return of the King.  The extras really bring some more human moments to the film.  As a fan of the books, I'm a little worried about where they're going with the Eowyn, Aragorn, Arwen triangle.  The Extended version makes the Eowyn attraction for Aragorn more obvious; and I hope they follow the relationships in the book in the last film.  From the commentary, it sounds like they will.  If they don't, every change they've done so far has worked for me.  After watching the Behind the Scenes, I trust that they will do what they think is best.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I heard one of the songs on this CD at a summer concert as a preview and thought, my God, he's crazy.  I bought the CD anyway.  It is very fluid and befitting the season with just the right JT tweaks.  In concert, Ian Anderson often skirts around the issues of his western European religious roots and dilutes it with the obligatory mentions of Eastern religions with a mix of agnostic indifference.  The man is a softy when it comes to good old fashioned Christmas spirit.  He can't fool anyone.  He has got to be the most excited person when good times come around the Yuletide season and friends and family gather around the tree and fireside. His Christmas CD reflects that.  It's a good holiday mood setter for any J Tullian.  If you permit yourself one Christmas CD per year, this should be the one for this year.  UPDATE - Christmas 2004.  Still one of my faves for the Season.  I only pull out my Holiday CD's starting Thanksgiving to keep them fresh.  Tull's contribution is so befitting that it already feels like a welcome fixture for the Holidays even though it's only in its second year.  Only a few more weeks until I break the seal on my Holiday collection...  UPDATE - Christmas 2005.  JT holds a place as the Christmas CD to play when trimming the tree.  I now warmly anticipate this JT CD every year and only break out my now very extensive Holiday and Christmas CD collection at Thanksgiving weekend and pack it up right after January 1. I am amused at those who don't like Tull and their reasons. So what? I don't see you in my home when I'm playing his stuff so no offense to you...  UPDATE - Christmas 2011.  Still one of the better to best Christmas CDs that I own and I have quite a few solid standards ranging from the 1940's or so on up to the present in all sorts of genres and sub genres..  Compare with the joke cd someone got me when it came out by Dylan...
0792833201|4.0|Poltergeist, directed by Tobe Hopper, provides a break from traditional horror films.  Lacking graphic violence, this film is instead a psychological thriller, which focuses on the feelings of a family in distress after their daughter disappears.  Carol Anne (Heather O'Rourke) is sucked into her bedroom closet, and into another dimension.  Still in the house, Carol Anne is able to communicate with the rest of her family.  The movie portrays the family's desperate struggle to bring their baby girl back into the world of the living.<br />The scariest aspect of the movie is that it breaks the feeling of comfort.  A home should be a place of safety and protection.  In the movie, ghosts invade the home of this family, destroying any innocence that might exist.  The unsafe atmosphere should frighten, and keep the viewer alert and anxious.  The close, personal relationship one has with his home and family is the root of horror that appears in the movie.<br />Very engaging and suspenseful, the movie keeps the viewer on the edge of his seat.  It entertains at every level.  It is a psychological thriller in that the family has to live with the fact that their daughter is alive and in their own house, yet they cannot reach her, and it is crammed with action and effects.  Every scene is important and action packed, therefore making the film enthralling and entertaining; the brilliant sequence of events leaves the viewer begging for more.<br />Made in 1982, the special effects are sub-par for this day and age.  In no way do they detract from the overall satisfaction of the movie, but the ghosts appear like cartoons and the monsters almost seem silly.  For its time, the special effects are top of the line.  Twenty years later, viewers are used to more.<br />While the movie provides some background information on the characters, it does not tell enough about Carol Anne, and the rest of the family.  Throughout the entire movie, it is difficult to empathize with the little girl while she is trapped because there is not enough time for an emotional connection to be made.  It is hard to feel her pain or grievances, frankly because it is difficult to really care about her well-being.  Although aimed more toward the emotional struggle of the family, a connection with the little girl would have made the film that much more frightening.<br />While older and more primitive compared to modern day horror movies, Poltergeist is still very highly recommended.  The psychological aspect alone can haunt one's nightmares and leave an overall feeling of fear.  This movie is a must see not only for horror fans, but for all people in general, because of its entertainment value, as well as its ability to scare without blood and gore.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|With &quot;Afterglow,&quot; Sarah McLachlan's newest disc in five years, she returns to the sophisticated songwriting and poignant melodies of her earlier work. The end result is a satisfying album sure to please even the most sceptical of Sarah fans. The best tracks on the album, &quot;Fallen&quot; and &quot;Answer,&quot; sound like they could have been b-sides from her earlier album &quot;Surfacing,&quot; and while the new release pales in comparison to previous releases (especially Fumbling Towards Ecstacy), it still makes for a relaxing night of quality music. Sarah's songwriting skills are as sharp as ever, and the production is as beautiful as anything she's released. Reccomended for every Sarah fan.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I bought the CD the last weekend, and i heard with attention and i realized some things. This CD is kind of darker than the other CD's, in fact, has a little influence of underground metal (opeth, cradle of fifth), and the result is good, is not the same that in other CD's for good or for worse because, in spite of the good result of their experimentation, this work hasn't melodic solos, Petrucci only play scales and scales, even though he show us that he improved in his technique. The piano is essential in this cd.<BR>In the name of god. A very good song.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This was a good album, filled with songs that had music and some words. Not too shabby for a group of people from Iceland who eat whale blubber.
B000002H33|5.0|After going through a long period of avoiding Metallica-- mainly because of their recent subpar albums and Lars' annoying rants about napster-- I was at a bar that was playing Master of Puppets. It was like running into an old friend. This album is amazing, and I think Ride the Lightning and Kill 'em All are equally as amazing. I have been listening to Metallica's first four albums non-stop ever since that night at the bar. An album like Master of Puppets will never be made again because there are no bands out there (including present day Metallica) that have the passion and the power that Metallica did when they made this album. Today's &quot;metal&quot; just flat out sucks and is all about image, as opposed to substance. In the early days, Metallica was all about the music-- nothing more and nothing less. Unfortunately, you can't say that about any musician today.  Thank God for Metallica!
B000089RVR|5.0|I have been a rabid Dido fan ever since she released her first album &quot;No Angel&quot; back in the day and have been impatiently awaiting the release of her second album. No it is here and I could honestly say that it was well worth the wait. She sticks to her trip-hop roots and her songs of love lost and found all covered in meticulous production. Standout tracks are &quot;White Flag,&quot; &quot;Stoned,&quot; &quot;Life for Rent&quot; and &quot;Who Makes You Feel?&quot; A great album for whenever you need some sophistication to go with your relaxation.

B000003TA4|5.0|i reiterate.  anyone that says that pearl jam inspired nirvana is smoking hardcore street crack.  V's in 1993 buddy?  umm...last time i checked, bleach was released under sub pop in late 1988, five years before V's, which isn't as good as 10 anyway.  if you would like the further argue the influence of mr. vedder upon nirvana, go ahead.  but even nevermind was released before V's man. (sub pop in late 1991, geffen in mid 1992.)  sure bands in local scenes have a lot of influence on eachother, but early nirvana, without grohl, was doing punk before grunge back when the melvins where still a seattle highlight.  why don't you quit ragging on other people, and get YOUR info right.  nevermind is a seminal album for all of rock.  say what you will about it's commerciality, but its influence is undeniable.  oh yeah, and pearl jam's still a good band, 10 is incredible.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is the only movie I have ever known where, evry one of the dozens of times I have watched it, I wish I could step into the screen and share this adventure with the characters.  The beauty of the East African landscape, the adrenaline and excitement of the hunt, the international group of friends (2 white Americans, 1 Native American, 1 German, 1 Frenchman, 1 Mexican, 1 French woman and 1 Italian woman) who obviously enjoy their friendship as much as they enjoy their job.  I watch and wish it was real and wish I was part of it.  <br />Old fashioned adventure, great early sixties style music from Mancini.  Actually, in many ways, this film is VERY 1962, the music, the dialogue, the attitudes all fit in with the big living days of the Rat Pack.  I'll never get tired of this movie.
B00005JKC3|3.0|Hmmm.I didn't feel too good after watching this film.I love dark,moody films that are beautifully made but Ang Lee misses the mark with this brooding downer.I'm a long time HULK fan,from the comics to the tv series,and Lee doesn't succeed in making the green guy or Banner sympathetic at all.THE HULK deserves better.

0790729628|2.0|+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on the novel \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep\\" (1968) by Philip K. Dick.<br /><br />The plot of this movie (original theatrical release in 1982) is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a policeman, in this movie's case a \\"blade runner,\\" of Los Angeles (in the year 2019) who's after four criminals, in this case genetically-made criminal \\"replicants\\" named Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Leon (Brion James).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).<br /><br />I watched this movie (\\"The Director's Cut\\") with a friend who did not see the original release that had Deckard's voice-over narration.  Guess what?  My friend could not follow the story!!!!  I could since I'd seen the original release but I found that I still missed Deckard's voice-over.<br /><br />I especially missed the voice-over when the Roy Batty replicant \\"dies\\" at the end of the movie.  This scene was not as emotionally appealing with the voice-over absent.<br /><br />I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important for this movie:<br /><br />(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action.<br />(2) It provides the human touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually-stunning special effects.<br />(3) It adds a \\"retro\\" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies.<br /><br />The ending of the the director's cut movie, I felt, was too abrupt.  The original release gave a feeling of hope that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.<br /><br />The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music provided by Vangelis are still fantastic and exhilarating.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />Without the voice-over narration, this movie (The Director's Cut) loses its magnificence and emotional impact.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION:<br /><br />Get the original 1982 theatrical version with Deckard's voice-over narration on DVD.  (This version is easily a five star movie.)<br /><br />** 1/2<br /><br />+++++riginal 1982 theatrical version with Deckard's voice-over narration on DVD.

B000002UY5|4.0|I just recently got this album, I'd heard &quot;Tones Of Home&quot; and of course &quot;No Rain&quot;, and found them both to be pretty good, but didn't really consider the album until a friend of mine put the gorgeous Led Zeppelin III-esque &quot;Change&quot; on a mix tape. I happened to find the album used later, and decided to pick it up. It's a bit different from what you might expect, most of the songs are more rocking than &quot;No Rain&quot; and their &quot;hippy rock&quot; reputation would suggest, and yet despite some similarities to early Pearl Jam and Jane's Addiction (mainly in the late Shannon Hoon's vocal style, which often recalls Perry Farrell), it's a bit too classic rock influenced to quite fit in with typical 90's grunge and alt-rock. However, this is a positive thing in the long run, as it's managed to stand the test of time surprisingly well for a debut by a band with a fairly shortlived 90's career. Although the songs sometimes seem to noodle on for too long, an overall pretty strong sense of melodicism and especially Shannon Hoon's soulful vocals keep this from dragging things down too much. Reccomended if you're a fan of Pearl Jam and Led Zeppelin.
B0000039PW|1.0|This is the only place in the world where a fat,ugly drug dealer can become a star.His voice is mediocre and he wouldnt of got anywhere without poop diddy.The beats to the songs on this album are okay but are nothing special.Overall, this album lacks substance and creativity.Too many sampled parts in the music and poop diddys voice is annoying.He glorified violence and ignorance so thats what led to his demise.He is way overrated like 50 cent and eminem.DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!!
B00006V9A0|1.0|I love Nirvana, but I'm rating this based on whether or not it's worth buying. To put it simply: This album is just not worth it, no matter how cheap you can get the CD. Too bad it wasn't released on cassette, because if it was up for grabs in the tape bargain bin for a dollar, then I'd say go for it. But since no new CD is that cheap, I'd say forget about it. Despite the fact that &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; is on the compilation (this is NOT an album), it still isn't worth anyone's asking price. YKYR reminds me of what Alt-Rock is considered to be these days (from pisspoor acts such as Smile Empty Soul and Staind)as opposed to what it really stood for when Bleach came out in 1989. If Kurt were had still been with us after April of '94, then I would've suggested he quit Nirvana if YKYR was the direction his music was going to take. As it is, this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; CD is just another hits compilation polluting the back catalogue of another great band's discography. Somebody outta come out with a compilation showcasing the Nirvana songs that would make the ears bleed of the buyers who bought this CD (featuring Kurt's best known grinder songs such as Raunchola, Anorexorcist, Hairspray Queen, Beeswax, If You Must, Scoff, Sifting and Paper Cuts).
B00009TB5G|4.0|This DVD is okay... but i really expected it to be a lot better! I would probably buy this thing if i want something kool for the holidays... (to give to my worst enemy!). Try not to bury the DVD after you watch it... it's only a DVD
0375751513|2.0|Though this book was well written, Oscar Wilde fails in his attempt to glorify aestheticism, and in fact condemns it, and thus condemns himself. It was hardly surprising that following the publication of this book, the authorities sought to have him arrested for homosexuality. If aestheticism is embodied by Lord Henry, Henry is a despicable character, whose philosophies sound not only juvenile and sophistic, but ignorant due to his lack of practicing what he preached. He didn't act out his hedonistic, immoral theories, only Dorian behaved that way, and when doing so brought torment, shame, and guilt upon himself. And to preface the book with &quot;All art is quite useless&quot;? That makes no sense, since the picture was the most useful, significant, meaningful thing in life. Was Wilde's goal to declare his own dear philosophies completely worthless? If so, he succeeded, but I am much more impressed by someone who sets out to justify his philosophies rather than someone who sets out to debunk them.

Their version of &quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; from Earls Court makes one wish that entire concert would be released, as it's so easy to see why Zep bootleggers consider it the Holy Grail!!  Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the footage would be this amazing and the sound would be so good.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|In a year where mainstream music has taken a new direction, it seems as though britney has missed the boat with this record.  Now she will always be pop, she will always have that foundation but instead of boarding the line of music trends she tries to carve her own niche in the clubbin music scene.  Well at least she tried.<br />Now, where christina's last record seemed to have no direction and just seemed to be a mish mash in hopes of hitting the target Britney does have a purpose with this record, to make sexy (emphasis on sex) beats that you can grind to.  No harm in that, except that these tracks are undeveloped, also that they seem dated.<br />I've read reviews comparing this to madonna's ray of light, this is nothing like it.  Where madonna took existing trends and mixing it with an electronic buzz that was new.  It didn't try to be a club record because it wasn't.  two completely different efforts.  Another reason is that madonna's songs and ideas came ot fruition where is britney seems to be stranded mid way through songs that just don't work with her voice.<br />Look at ashanti, she has a horrible voice right up there with britney's but she knows to make music that accentuates her shortcomings instead of exuding them without a care in the world it seems.<br />This record, with all it's good intentions just misses the mark to put it plain and simple.  Not to mention but for some reason spears a long with christina thing that mature and sexy, means to be down right slutty (mind you spears does appear mild compared to latter) and are just cases of giving kids too much freedom all at once instead of being eased into it.  Another difference is that where is britney really is a sweet girl, good natured (albiet a bit miss guided) christina well she's just a well I won't go there.
B0000VCZK2|1.0|A lot of people have been complaining that this new box set contains two movies (the last two) that aren't particularly good. Although this is true, be patient. In January, Fox will offer the movies individually. There's no way I am going to have Alien3 in my house, so I'm going to wait until then. Too bad they didn't release these versions in the first place, but we all know that studios will release as many versions of a given movie as is possible.

0385504209|1.0|Interesting fiction but this does not pass the common sense test as any sort of real research. Why? ........... Well let's connect the dots:<br />Historical Fact: The most skeptical atheist theologian would accept that at least 4 of the apostles died for their faith. St. Peter being crucified on Vatican Hill will be the example here.<br />Psychiatric Fact: There has never been a case of multiple people hallucinating the same thing at the same time even attempts with modern drugs.<br />ERGO: Christ's appearances were not hallucinations.<br />SO:  Jesus was resucitated, pretended to have risen from the dead and and his followers went around starting a cool new but bogus religion while Jesus went to live in the south of France with a babe.<br />AND THEN: Nero thought the Christians were a pain in his rear so he rounded up Peter, their leader and had him crucified (no fun) in the Circus.<br />BUT: Peter could have told where Jesus was and surely bargained his way back to a quiet fishing job on tne Sea of Galilee. But he decided to die a tortuous death to protect a guy with a babe on the French Riviera.<br />RIGHT!<br />Antone who takes this book seriously ............. ?
B00005JMCW|5.0|This is one movie you and your family will enjoy watching together.
B00005JL78|5.0|There is an incredible amount of insight that went into this movie.  Everyone likes the idea of fighting crime: politicians get re-elected fighting it; police receive praise for attacking it at every nook and corner; citizens feel safer when, as a society, we are defeating it.<br />Given this context, what would happen if a politician were to endorse the idea of locking up criminals before they engange in their criminal acts?  It sounds good: after all, aren't they likely to engange in the act if they are locked up?<br />Forget the issue as to whether such acts are constitutional (they clearly they are not), the question is, is it good policy?  Dick points to the idea that it clearly isn't, and that while it may seem like a good idea to completely eradicate crime, the practice of doing so would clearly create far more harm than good.<br />For instance, if we label someone as extremely likely to engange in the act and arrest them before they committ it, we are saying that people essentially have no free-will and we eliminate the possibility that they may change their thinking before they engange in the behavior.  What we would be doing is, in a sense, locking people up for poor thoughts--no--dangerous thoughts.<br /> This is an important lesson for all those closet utopians who believe that an intellectual can come up with an idea and cure all of society's ills.  This book clearly errs in being skeptical of those in power who would sacrifice our freedom in the name of temporary security.  As Benjamin Franklin once said, \\"Those who would sacrifice a little freedom for temporal safety deserve neither to be safe or free.\\"<br />Michael Gordon

B00009ATIX|1.0|I was forced to go see this god-awful movie with my girlfriend, and it was a total waste of time.  This movie dragged on forever, and it had the worst storyline ever created.  The acting is so poor that I was laughing during some scenes.  When the movie was over, I heard people in the theater saying things like &quot;Well that was the worst movie I've ever seen.&quot; and &quot;What a crappy movie.  I want my money back!&quot;<br />Avoid this movie at ALL costs.  Don't even watch it if someone rents it for you.  You have better things to do with your time.
B00005ATQD|3.0|Eyes Wide Shut isn't as bad a movie as many people take it to be. It is defenitly long and WAY too slow, but it's still pretty intruiging nontheless. It's hardly perverted; if you want perverted, there's plenty of hardcore porn in the world. Most of the nudity is pretty tasteful, not as psychotically erotic as some people take it to be. Still, this isn't Kubrick's best movie, and you'd be better off watching Lolita or Dr. Strangelove. Strange though, how people find this more perverse than Lolita...<br />Overall, Eyes Wide Shut is a good rent.

There are old men and women in suits holding meetings in big conference rooms high above the streets of Manhattan, talking about different strategies on how they can get YOU to buy more of this crap... er, I mean, their &quot;product.&quot;  Don't believe those mega-media liars and hypocrites!!!<br />WAIT!  If Slipknot clicked with you because it's so heavy and agressive, great--but know that there dozens and dozens of other bands out there that are even more intense and have every element Slipknot does--just not as many members.  They're also much better musicians.  Listen to Meshuggah and you'll start to get the idea.<br />These other bands don't get fed to you and your friends through MTV, magazines and t-shirts you buy in the mall because they don't look the part.  They don't have that gimmick of wearing masks to make themselves seem more enigmatic.  They don't give a rat about looking sick.  If that's what you're into, fine--but admit that Slipknot still doesn't beat Gwar in that arena.<br />It's going to be okay.  Consider Slipknot the band that busted your cherry.  Now make an effort to find some real music.
6304493681|5.0|this is a great film! i enjoyed it much. the original manga is very good as well.<br />but what i'm writing here to plug, what i wish was available for us to get here (maybe someday...) is the recent series that was created, Ghost In The Shell: Stand Alone Complex. it's one of my favorite animes i've ever seen. it essentially takes place in an alternet universe in which the events of this film didn't take place, but it has the same characters and world. the stories, the settings, the animation... all of it is fantastic! if you can, try to download or find a copy of GITS: SAC and watch a few episodes. you will be satisfied!
B000002KIE|5.0|first off: LONG LIVE THE SEX PISTOLS, THEY RULE, the songs are genius and the lyrics will scare the crap out of any good charolette fan. johhny rotten is the man, some call his voice whiney and annoying, and reviews like that give me headaches because those people don't grasp a damn thing, second: all this talk about the ramones inventing punk pisses me off, YOU EVER HEARD OF IGGY AND THE STOOGES YOU DUMBASSES?!? not that the ramones suck THEY RULE TO but anyway, this cd has awesome vocals from rotten, amazing guitar from jones, if you hear a boom BANG BANG BANG it's the great drumming of cook and then there sid on bass what can i say SID YOU RULED R.I.P. <br />fin

B00007JMCX|4.0|I just purchased THE MAN WHO FELL TO EARTH and was completely blown away by the sheer eclectisism of the film. Bowie does a great job in portraying &quot;Mr. Newton&quot;...the alien slash not so human freek pod who falls from the heavens in search for water, to save his planet from an ecological disaster. He becomes a multi zillionare off these quirky little patents he puts together, to strong hold the technological industry. The music is straight groovy. I recommend you get a little intoxicated with your choice of narcotic before you watch. I did not give the movie 5 stars because the dvd being THX certified did not include a THX trailer before the film. Enjoy my fellow Space Cowboys and uh' pass the water i'm thirsty!!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish. If you saw the TV special you will find that the extra 6 songs on the dvd rock! There's a total of 22 songs in all. Shania's band always amazing.<BR>The crowd obviously love every second! <br />This Is The Best DVD That I have Ever Seen in My life
0316779237|5.0|There are few authors who make us laugh out loud. David Sedaris will.
B000089RVR|4.0|With the gargantuan sales of No Angel natrually all eyes have been on Dido's follow-up, and reviews have not been favourable.  Well in light of a debut album which was perhaps 'perfect romantic coffee table music', any ear listening to this cd would have automatically dismissed it as rubbish.  I for one did -I listened to it once and thought 'where's the tunes'.  Then I have it another whirl, then another and so on...and here I am.  Loving this cd for its simplicity of musical arrangement and sweet vocals.  No one sings about love so well as Ms Dido (perhaps Gloria and Celine are the contenders), and some of the trax here compound this fact.  First single White Flag is just chocolate on a cd.....defiant, lush and optimistic all at once, I gave in to this sing and am waving the white flag ever since.  The next best song is the title track (and a gorgeously haunting video to accompany), a song about owning nothing really in life.  There are some other trax which are wonderful to listen to...This Land Is Mine, India, etc.  It's hard to break the album down.  I can only recommend what I've done....listen, relax...open a bottle of wine.  I guarantee this will be your chill-out album until.....well, the next Dido album no doubt. Love it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I didn't use to like Britney Spears' music because I found it bland and generic.  This fourth effort, however, contains many refreshingly original, highly danceable tracks.  The luscious rhythms and melodies of &quot;Me Against the Music,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Show Down&quot; and &quot;The Hook up&quot; are especially irresistable.  The performances on &quot;Shadow&quot; and the other ballads are also solid.  Overall, a very enjoyable album definitely worth buying if you're into pure pop.
B0000C6K09|5.0|This collection has intended to bring together some of the best work from this centurys greatest composer! And it achieves this just.<br />On the four disc that you get for your money, you are bombarded by william's talent for creating mood in the music that brings you so close to the film itself, you almost no longer need the pictures or the actors to see the film. His scores help to set the mood of the film and every note played every chord struck fits the action of the film exactly. Great examples are the raiders march, duel of the fates or hedwig's theme.<br />However, there is one very big drawback to this CD boxset, and that is the attention given to one of his greatest soundtracks. I'm talking about superman. This was a soundtrack that actually sounded as incredible as the film itself was. There was no sense of O.T.T about and neither was it underplayed and shadowed by the film, but it made the film as much what it was as christopher reeve playing the man of steel himself. The superman score makes you want to put a red bedspread round your neck and fly off the building. But here in the box set of his greatest work, john william's superman score is reduced to having just one track on one of the discs. At the very least it should have had fortress of solitude on there aswell!!!<br />But apart from that this is a truely a value for money CD collection.
0783117523|5.0|I have been looking all over for this movie which I haven't seen. I finally found it, rented it, watched it tonight, and it's a very very sad story. Gia finally got sober only to find out she had the AIDS virus from a dirty needle. It's such a waste. I looked up the real Gia online, and saw the website and all the photos and my eyes started to tear. The real Gia, as well as Angelina, is gorgous. (Was I mean) Aids is a terrible thing. Nowadays people still share needles and engage in unprotected sex. There was a time in my life where I felt bitter towards society because I had issues with that and I couldnt understand why people would risk it. Gia is a different story. In the 80's AIDS wasn't fully understood like it is today. And once you become addicted to narcotics, your judgement is impaired and you become desperate and do risky things just to get the drugs. \\"I don't shoot.\\" is what she said at first, which didn't remain for too long. It was a tragic story. Not just the drugs, or the aids, but the lack of love and support she dealt with. She was very young and started her career at a young age, and did it alone. Alone with her depression and the confusion of life and growing up, it's a shame she turned to drugs thinking it would be okay if she was high. I don't know what else to say except this is a good example of drug abuse and what it does. I've heard people say \\"I don't care if i get aids, i just wanna have fun.\\" But they don't know what they are talking about. Once you get it, you ARE sorry. It's a terrible way to die, and you better believe you will regret it. And to die at a young age. It just isn't worth it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great dvd that everyone needs to get. It was just released and I am sure it will sell so well. The dvd is great because it has some great songs and she looks great. It has to be one of her best concerts ever. This dvd features so much more than the telecast. Check it out!
B000065V41|5.0|What a great movie! <BR>It's the Muppet Version of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens. Ebenezer Scrooge is played, not by a muppet but by Michael Caine. Everyone knows not to mess with Ebenezer Scrooge - his penny-pinching ways and bah-humbug attitude could make even the bluest skies cloudy. But when he is alone on Christmas eve, he is visited by three spirits: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present and The Spirit of Christmas's Yet To Come - and gets to see the impact that he has had on the world - and it's not a pretty sight! But, along the way he comes across the life of his poor and kind employee, Bob Cratchit (Kermit) and his family including Tiny Tim who teaches Scrooge the true meaning of Christmas and ends the with the immortal words &quot;God Bless us, everyone.&quot;<BR>This is a great movie to watch for kids and adults! Jim Henson's movies never disappoint! Full of hilarious jokes and good humor for families, and a wonderful performance by Micheal Caine, you and your entire movie will love this movie - and it will hopefully get you out of your Humbug mood and put the Christmas spirit in you too!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Anybody who is a Shania Twain fan must purchase this DVD, especially if they have never seen Shania live in concert. The show is energetic, fun, and showcases Shania's amazing talent. There are extra performances that were not shown on television. I am extremely pleased with the mix of songs that Shania incorperated in this concert. I've been following her career since the debut of her first album in 1993 so I love seeing her perform the Shania classics. It's refreshing to see she has not forgotten her past hits that launched her career, as some performers do. I guarantee a good time whenever you watch this incredible performance by Shania. So, do yourself a huge favor and buy a copy!
156898443X|4.0|Gregory's crude drawings are reminiscent of Ralph Steadman and Bill Gallo. I particularly liked the whimsical self-portraits, including Happy Hedgehog Gregory. In short, Gregory's journal is intimate without being self-indulgent. It's also cathartic for anyone who has been damaged by tragedy. We're all a work in progress and I applaud Gregory's honest outpouring of emotion.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania returns after a 3 year break form the stage. This is the best special yet from the queen of country. From old favorites like &quot;Any Man of Mine&quot; and &quot;Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?&quot; to signature songs like &quot;Man! I Feel Like A Woman!&quot; to the new songs off of Up! &quot;I'm Gonna Getcha Good!&quot;, &quot;In My Car&quot;, and &quot;Forever and For Always&quot;, Shania is covered on this DVD. Plus, the excitment of &quot;I'm Outta Here!&quot;, &quot;Nah!&quot;, and &quot;Rock This Country&quot; top off this party with Shania!!
B0000DCGT1|5.0|This is a delightful movie from beginning to end. The ensemble cast works well-- so often multi-star pictures flop, because all of them are out there trying to play their own schticks. Here, the ensemble co-ordinates like the petals on a blooming flower.<br />Another reason this film succeeds is that the pacing is flawless. Every moment comes at exactly its time, and none is too strong or too weak.<br />I don't suppose there's much point in recounting the plot: it's the story of the racehorse, Seabiscuit, and the people who made him a champion. That's all. It's a simple story, but the simpler the result, usually the greater the mechanism for bringing it forth. I'm sure that's the case here. The animal trainers must have spent many hours teaching the horses to act their parts. The cinematographers, too, must have dedicated pieces of their lives to have every shot perfect.<br />See this movie. You won't be sorry. Really, that's all that needs to be said.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I love this dvd. It is so great. It has a lovely woman singing all of my favorite songs. The live performance is powerful with Shania's vocal sounding better than ever. It is a must-have dvd.
B0000C1733|4.0|Most the songs they picked were good.  But a few didn't represent the Chili's.  I agree with many other reviews, what is &quot;Universally Speaking&quot; doing on here?  Not that I don't like the song, but Can't Stop should have replaced this for sure.  Other songs that should have been on here, not neccesarily my taste, but the songs that best represent the Chili's:<br />&quot;Aeroplane&quot;, &quot;Love Roller Coaster&quot;, &quot;Around The World&quot;, and &quot;Can't Stop.&quot;  Possibly &quot;Power Of Equality&quot; as well.  But if you're looking to get introduced to this band, this is a good album to buy.  However, &quot;By The Way&quot; is by far their best album and don't let the lack of songs from that album taint you.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is Shania at her best!!! Her music is energizing, and insprirational and it is always such a pleasure to watch her perform live!! I only wish that I could've been there to watch it myself, but having this DVD is the next best thing. &quot;She's not just a pretty face&quot; and Yes, Shania Twain has everything it takes!!! Enjoy a good time with one of country's greatest &quot;divas&quot; ... Shania Twain
B00009TB5G|5.0|The story is the continuation of Frodo Baggin's quest for the ring as he is being helped by the tricky critter Gollum and must go to Mordor.<br />This 4-disc extended DVD set is quite a better one than the cut edition, there is 40 minutes of new scenes and new music by Howard Shore. The new scenes add more character devolopment and scenes that make even more sense, it also has tons of documentaries on the making of this remarkable sequel including a look of how Gollum was fully made.<br />There is even audio commentaries, design gallery, a hidden easter egg on Disc 1 and more. So if your a movie lover or anyone who loves LOTR then this set would be the perfect gift.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I loved Shania Twain's Up! Live in Chicago because of her band members, which adds a lot of zest and rock to Shania Twains music! I particularly liked the way Shania Twain is able to multitask by singing, shaking hands, giving high fives pointing at various signs indicating her favorites all at the same time without skipping a note! I have noticed that everyone in the audience is having a good time and is participating with Shania Twain by singing with her! Seems that most seem to know her music and are having real fun with it! There were parts that were left out but hey the DVD overall was way cool!
B000005ILF|4.0|I remember being somewhat disappointed when MF came out back in 1996, but mainly because it was being compared agaisnt none other than Ten Summoner's Tales. <BR>Now listening to it you can tell there is great quality and spirit behind the songs, great musicianship with real drums, real pianos, saxophones, cello's etc, and Sting's voice is in top form. The subject matter is sort of wintry, but in a nice way. I consider this Sting's last solo album, what came after was just a marketing move to sell more records, but in the process losing what was good about his music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|All I can say is that this was an excellent concert film that no Beatle or George Harrison fan should miss out on.  Eric Clapton and company gave a moving tribute to George, and the music by no means spoke for itself.  Billy Preston's rendition of &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Isn't a Pity&quot; brought another dimension to these songs, which was both soulful and energetically charged.<br />For a musician who had been called the so-called &quot;quiet&quot; Beatle, his music as a solo artist was not at all quiet, but rather inspirational, spiritual, and timeless.  This is a highly recommended dvd that should not be missed.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This CD actually travels with me from my car to my house!  I can't stop listening to it.  I LOVED the Broadway show and was skeptical about seeing the movie.  After I saw it, I HAD to have the CD.  I actually like the movie soundtrack better than the B'way show soundtrack.  I'm not a big Catherine Zeta-Jones fan, but she TOTALLY nails the part of Velma.  (Sorry, Bebe Neuwirth, but Catherine owns &quot;All That Jazz&quot; now.)  Queen Latifa belts out an incredible &quot;When You're Good To Mama&quot;...I had no idea she could sing like that!  Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere make the rest of the soundtrack fun.  If you've seen the play or the movie, this CD is a MUST OWN.
B0000CFW87|4.0|First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of both Josh Groban and Clay Aiken, two young, very talented young men. Granted, different arena's of music, but talented none the less. I came on this site to read the reviews for Josh's cd and leave my own, only to see someone feeling the need to bash a fellow artist at the end of a review that should only have concerned Josh Groban. Mr. Chan, that was uncalled for. If you don't have an open-mind for other artists (who have fans of their own, as music is subjective) please REFRAIN from bashing those other artists. I'm sure Mr. Groban would not wish a &quot;fan&quot; of his using a review of his cd to take pot shots at other artists. I have not left bashings on other artists anywhere on the internet (although I realize some &quot;fans&quot; do so, which is wrong) - please try to be mature and not do so in the future. Anyway, this cd is a beautiful piece of work. I am not trained in foreign languages or high opera so I am going by the sheer joy of listening to this young man's spectacular vocals. Anyone purchasing this cd will find something to praise.
B00006690G|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I am NOT a fan of rap. At all. So I was suprised when I heard Eminem because I actually enjoyed his music. I had heard the song Stan originally from a previous album and was suprised at how clever his rhymes were. <br />2. White America - (10/10) - Catchy tune for the opening song. He's a brave man because I would NEVER criticize the government in public. Most people may thing he is insulting America, but he isnt he is simply saying that he has his opinions on the way the government is run.<br />3. Business - (7/10) - I think this is one of the weakest tracks on the album but that doesn't mean it isn't good it just cannot compare with the other great songs. <br />4. Cleaning out my closet - (10/10) - I really do not understand how when critics listen to this song, they can't hear the anger and pain in his voice. His mother obciously hurt him at one point and his music is his way of getting the hurt out. Very good song and very emotional.<br />5. Square Dance - (8/10) - Interesting song with an interesting title. Touches a bunch of topics. <br />6. The Kiss - (9/10) explains how he got arrested...shows the two sides of what he was feeling that day..the good eminem and the bad eminem<br />7. Soldier - (10/10) - Violent and emotional. At first listen I might have thought...geez this guy has some problems. Once you listen though you get the message. No one listens to his story because they judge first. <br />8. Say Goodbye to Hollywood - (9/10) - Great song about how fame is getting to be too much for him and he needs to take a break. Also allows a view into how alone he really feels.<br />9. Drips - (7/10) - Not my favorite because of the sexual content of the lyrics, but still an interesting song.<br />10.Without me - (10/10) a fun song that describes his position in the music business<br />12. Sing for the Moment - (11/10) - Great song about the effect of music on people and how unfair life sometimes is.<br />The rest of the songs areall great and interesting but the one song I want to talk about is Hailies song. It is beautiful, emotional and everything that you would no expect from EMinem. As he states in the beginning of the song he is NOT a great singer. But the song is so emotional that it actually makes you want to cry. This man that everyone says is nuts and crazy or whatever writes a song about how much he loves his little girl. In the world of rap writing sentimental things hardly ever happens. This song is so personal for him and he put his heart on the line just to show his daughter how much he loves her. Makes you reconsider how you judge people.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban has outdone himself once again!!!!!! Tracks 8 and on are the best ones on this album. I would strongly recommed this cd to any Classical or an easylistening fan! His second cd is just as good as his first which was EXCELLENT!!! BUY THIS CD IFYOU'RE A TRUE FAN OF JOSH OR ANY OF THE GENRES OF MUSIC I NAMED ABOVE!!! A must have in your cd collection!!!!! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR GO BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|She can't sing--bottom line. And her sub-Kylie Minogue posturing on every single song is forced and tiresome. She was great as a kid star and even better as a mini sex kitten, but as a \\"take me seriously adult entertainer\\" she just falls flat. Witness the paint by numbers execution of the first single \\"Me Against The Music\\" with her pseudo sex pal Madonna (another big yawn)and you get the picture. It all comes off sounding like Justin Timberlake knock-offs,and he could actually sing them better than she does here.Save your money, and buy the new Kylie cd instead.....
B00005QIPH|4.0|Now, when the hype about the The Strokes and The Vines and The Hives and The...oh who cares!...came about, I swore to myself and anyone who would listen that I would never buy one of their albums. I never agreed with the sentiment that any of these bands could bring the so-called &quot;return of rock&quot; that so many people were counting on...and I still don't. BUT I decided to give &quot;Is This It&quot; a listen, and I found that I actually might like this &quot;The&quot; band. All the songs are genuinely good and most certainly different than what we have been hearing in popular music recently. The only small problem that I have with it is the fact that all the songs are too likeable...meaning that they all pretty much sound somewhat the same. I definitely could not name each song by just hearing it, except &quot;Last Nite.&quot; All in all, though, I really like listening to this album and I recommend to anyone who liked &quot;Last Nite&quot; and wants a whole album of it. But, as far as the &quot;The&quot; bands, they are not going to usher in the new phase of rock &amp; roll. You can't just put &quot;The&quot; in front of your name and become a page in rock history. Sorry, guys.
0783226888|5.0|Another remake, a great movie - Day of the Jackal with the brilliant Edward Fox - so I tended to cringe in anticipation, but surprisingly this film scores a bullseye because of solid performances from Richard Gere, Bruce Willis, Sidney Poitier, Mathilda May (Lifeforce) but most especially from Diana Devora (the 13th Warrior, FX).<br />Gere plays Declan Mulqueen, an IRA terrorist who is in prison.  He and Mathilda May were former lovers and worked with Willis, but he betrayed them.  Diana Devora is a Russian intelligence officer, Valentina Koslova.  She is working with Carter Preston US intelligence officer (Sidney Poitier) in taking down Russian Mafia.  Only the Mafia wants to strike back and send the Jackal - Willis - on a assassination to make a statement by killing the First Lady.  Devora and Poitier get Gere out of English jail, on a temporary leave, to help track down Willis.  Willis is a master of disguise, so only Gere stands a chance of tracking him down before he completes his mission.<br />It's fast paced, yet leisurely plots Willis preparations for the kill.  Well done from start to finish.  Not better than the original, but just as enjoyable.  Excellent soundtrack as well.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|As someone who has never purchased a Rufus Wainwright album, I was completely amazed at what this 30 year old man has accomplished.  This is a selection of sounds &amp; lyrics that you'll be comtemplating for quite a while after it's over.  I especially like the 2nd &amp; 6th tracks (I Don't Know What It Is, &amp; Go or Go Ahead).  Both are well crafted gems that you'll savour.  If you buy the enhanced edition, be sure &amp; take advantage of the link to a &quot;Secret Site&quot; where Rufus listens to the entire album with you, and describes (with much humor &amp; insightfulness) the origin of the lyrics &amp; music.  I think you can tell that I enjoyed this album very much.  If you're looking for a great gift for the holidays, you can't go wrong with this.  Enjoy!
B0000B1OFL|4.0|Well, the original Italian Job is one of my favourite movies, so when I heard they were doing a remark and that is bore little resemblance to Michael Caine's film, I was mildly resistant, expecting another of the string of remakes of the past couple years that take the title and give you a poor excuse for a film.  Well, this one too the title, but surprisingly it's a fun film.  I still recommend the Original as one great time, but hey, who says a remake cannot be good, too.<br />Any film that has Donald Sutherland will be worth watching, so that is a good starting point.  He plays the mentor of Charlie Croker (Mark Walhberg).  He is also the father of Stella Bridger's character, Charlize.  She takes after daddy dearest in talent for cracking safes, but she does it for the police testing the security for banks etc.  Well Dad is up to old tricks and pulls of 'the Italian job' with Walhburg.  Only Edward Norton (guess that is what happens from hanging around with Hannibal Lecter!) double crosses them.<br />So, Walhburg and Bridger must set out to con the con by stealing from Norton.<br />The Title and the Cooper Minis are about the only thing retained from the original film, but this is still one fun, fast paced film.  I went into watching this expecting I would not like it.  So I was very surprised how much I did.<br />Does not mean you won't like the original, too!
B00006G8G1|2.0|The worst thing that could happen for Iron Maiden was when its founder, its boss, the marvellous bass player and songwriter called Steve Harris decided to edit this DVD. I don´t understand it.<br />Theoretically trying to &quot;capture&quot; the famous Maiden energy and vibe on stage, he opted for using a ultra-fast edition that will make your head spin, without paying any attention for who is soloing at the moment, if Nicko is at the middle of a great drums flourish, etc. All of the takes last, in their majority, less than one second and a half. The result was that you simply have no pleasure watching this MTV-styled DVD, thanks to its terrible edition.<br />Well, that´s my opinion. Of course, the &quot;UP THE IRONS&quot; guys will love anything this deservedly great band release.
B00009RDG9|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones can make any movie worth watching, even limp ones and this ones is so lame.  Actually a waste of his powerhouse talents.  Tommy Lee Jones is a trainer of assassins, and he trains Benicio Del Toro (The Usual Suspects) into the perfect killing machine.  We have given reasons (VAGUE REASONS) why suddenly Del Toro cannot stomach being a killing machine any longer, so what does he do...goes rogue and kills.  There is only one person who can catch him, Tommy Lee Jones, who is ageing.<br />So starts a nice cat and mouse game - but who is the cat and mouse.  Nice watch, but will soon fade.  Doubt most people would want repeat views of this movie, is do, suggest getting a used copy.  Tommy Lee is worth that.  His performance is marvellous, just the rest of the film does not match his level.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Other than the stellar hit 'me against the music', britney spears's new album is a disappointment.  Britney tries to merge pop with hip-hop and/or techno vibes, which in this case does not sound appealing.  The few ballads that she has on the album are also evidence that britney is an not a singer, as she struggles to find the right key.  No amount of scandelous kisses with madonna or attention grabbing acts can create enough hype to make me want to purchase this album.
B00005JKN9|2.0|This was pushed as THE film of the year. Since I love history, and this is based on historical fact, and it was loaded with a powerhouse cast, I thought wow...<br />Then I saw it and I said wow...but with a different inflection.<br />This film was brutal, an ugly film that was an exercise in wallowing in violence with nothing to redeem the film. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio are miscast, completely. Diaz's role seems so unclear, like they said hey, let's stick Diaz in here for star power. DiCaprio, usually a very talented actor, looks like a little boy trying to play big boy and worse, his performance was so dull as if we walked through the whole film. At time, his efforts are near comical. Daniel Day-Lewis turned in a stunning performance, but nearly stomach churning at times. Liam Neeson, another fine actor is there for a thankless near cameo role.<br />Sorry, for the money that went into this film, it's such a disappointment.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|and was still absolutely blown away from this performance.  Give to this to any nonBruce fan for Christmas and they'll be converted within the first 3 songs.  The crowd is amazing... into every single song.  I am from New Jersey and I have never seen a Bruce crowd like that, hats off to Barcelona.  I had no problem w/ the second disc as many have - I'd be upset too.  The sound was fine for me (Sony Dream Theater).  I loved it so much I watched it 2 times in a row.  5 hours on the couch Brucing out like I was 15 years old again.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|This film really showcased Michael's comedic talent, and with the backing of the super cast right down to Benny Hill, it's a super time.  Michael plays the mastermind behind a gold heist, while Benny Hill is the technical genius making Michael's scheme work.  Where most films of &quot;the big heist&quot; is on the actual job, this film set itself out by using humour and the Coopers escape to make it one fabulously funny time.<br />Caine is at his best as the freshly out of jail, but far from reformed crook.  The end is just so droll!!!<br />Glad to add this one my Michael Caine collection!
B0000CAQ27|5.0|i have been a fan of pink since she started.  and her albums just keep getting better as she goes.  this album takes pink in a new direction from her previous, but there is nothing wrong with that.  this album is definitely more rock oriented and pink certainly makes it work.  although the album is not all rock the dance songs do not disappoint either, and to be honest i dont think any of the tracks are out of place on the record.  i love the song trouble because it is a cool song but also because the music part can really get you going, it is not an ordinary song and has a great beat behind it.  my next favorite song is track 4.   i cant remeber the title right off hand but it is tonights the night or something like that.  this song also has a really great beat behind it and is a cool song about not having anything to do on a weekend but wanting to.  track 10 rules.  i love it.  it is a rock song with coolness.  i can listen to it over and over.  the guitars in the song make the pace go fast and keep your head bouncing.  the hidden track on the record is so cool and the title alone says it all.....HOOKER...  it makes you wonder if she is talking about someone in particular.  but the song is cool and is very raw.  this is definitely an album for the more mature crowd and not the little kids that think pink is just cool.  there is not an adult advisory on this ablum for nothing.  but i love this album, but it did take me a few listens to really realize what i really had.
B000084T18|5.0|50 Cent busts on the scene with his gangsta major-label debut, \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\", executive produced by masters of the game, Dr. Dre and Eminem. It's easy to overlook just how good \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" really is, because of all the hype and proclamations that 50 has been shot 9 times. It's easy to overlook just how good it is because 50 is on the verge of being the most overexposed rapper in history (Eminem, his mentor, values privacy a little too much for his biggest fans, and Dr. Dre is the strong silent type, and also the one-album-every-seven-years type, but that's another story). It's easy to overlook just how good it is if you're a Ja Rule fan. However, upon listening from track 1 (the pointless 6 second intro) to track 19 (an older 50 track, \\"Life's On The Line\\", a nice album-ender), it is hard to deny that 50's debut is as good as or better than those by Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Doggy Dogg, 2Pac, and Biggie.<BR>The album starts strongly with the instantly quotable banger \\"What Up Gangsta?\\" and goes straight into the brooding, powerful \\"Patiently Waiting\\", produced by and featuring Eminem, who serves up an ingenious verse sandwiched between 50's witty threats. The next two tracks are instant classics: the profound, dark, even deep \\"Many Men (Wish Death)\\", and the single, \\"In Da Club\\", boasting what is easily Dr. Dre's best production in years. The album continues consistently from here on, whether it be the tongue-in-cheek(?) extreme violence of the Dre-produced \\"Heat\\", the excellent Ja Rule diss \\"Back Down\\", the sex boast that is \\"P.I.M.P.\\" (the remix is better, but this'll do), or the expert production by Eminem on \\"Don't Push Me\\" (also featuring Em and Lloyd Banks of G-Unit). After a while, you'll realize that nothing on here warrants the dreaded fast-forward button, and 50's debut couldn't have been better realized.
6304293321|5.0|I bought a couple VHS copies of &quot;Born Free&quot; for myself and for my nephews last Christmas, thinking &quot;that would be a nice, clean movie for kids to have&quot;, and I was not disappointed. You are instantly struck by the innocence of this movie. As another reviewer on this page wrote, I too cried more watching it as an adult and my husband and I remarked that we were really moved by it. Joy Adamson (played by Virginia McKenna) making her tearful speech about Elsa's right to be free struck us to the heart, that scene alone is enough to make this movie a classic.  <br />Since seeing it again I have bought more as gifts for kids and for people who have grandkids. It is the favorite of our 17 month old, we always watch with him and skip the two very brief shooting scenes and the scene where Elsa kills the warthog, mind you these scenes are not graphic at all and they are very brief but he still put two and two together and cried. He was also upset by the cubs knocking over stuff and spilling the milk at first, but he quickly came to understand that that was okay. He loves this movie so much and begs all the time to see it. After seeing it the first time, we found him with his stuffed toys gathered around him &quot;feeding&quot; them from his bottle, like Joy and the lion cubs. <br />Due to the movie being made in the 60's, there is the one pitfall of the movie, the fact that the white characters have black African servants. The main black character is loved by all viewers of the movie, but still, the black employees are clearly in servitude and this jumps out at you; this element obviously has to be explained to kids but the movie is true to its time in history and of value to children despite this, and perhaps also because of this historical lesson. <br />Kids of all ages that we've seen watching this, (who have been raised on today's kids' movies that are so full of aggression, violence, sarcasm, etc,) were not at all bored by this innocent movie but instead were instantly captivated by it. All ages of viewers are so uplifted when Elsa gets to be free and be with her own kind. This movie is so uplifting, it's about freedom, the dignity of living creatures, compassion, responsibility, love, and hope. Beautiful scenery and animal footage, plus plenty of lighter moments and laughs. Adults get a little chuckle out of the very polite script, straight from the 1960's, though it is like a breath of fresh air, and of course there's the wonderful theme song which you will find yourself singing in the car and shower. Get out the popcorn and snuggle the whole family on the couch to watch this one.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I can't stress enough the fact that this is most definitely Britney Spears' best album to date.  It is so different from her other albums, with more experimentation and a more mature sound.  Also, for those of you who feel that \\"she is leaving behind her younger fans\\" or \\"its too sexual\\"...WAKE UP!  Her \\"younger fans\\" are growing up with her, and if you think she's too sexual, give yourself a shake.  You clearly are ignoring the other female singers that are out there (ie. Christina Aguilera, Beyonce, ect).  Don't judge her for being who she is, and don't let your opinion of her let you miss out on this amazing album.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney Spears is living proof that a lot of modern day pop music, has nothing to do with vocal talent, as it does with visual production.  What is so sad, is that her legion of young fans cheer her wildly, during her concerts, and she isn't even singing a note?  Didn't Milli Vanilli, get into big trouble in the late eighties, for doing just that!  I find it very odd, that todays younger generation, finds lip syncing acceptable?  Most artist's who do that can't sing, period.  Most of the songs on this CD are immature, grunting x-rated nursery rhymes, set to the typical computerized Britney overdub voice.  Christina Aquilera may get a little raunchy as well, but at least she has a real set of pipes?  This Cd is just horrible, and it shows, because sales and airplay are slowing significantly.  In my day you actually had to have some ability to get a recording contract?  The same cannot be said today!  Her act is nothing more than glorified stripping, and for that, young people pay money?  How pathetic!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney gets a lot of crap because of how she dresses and acts, well, wake up America.  You give me one other artist of today that does not act like her.  You have Christina, Beyonce, Ashanti, Lil Kim, etc. I think she is just reinventing herself and trying to reach a broader audience.  If you don't like it, don't buy it or listen to it. Your radios have more then one channel.<br />Oh and in response to the one review about immature lyrics,\\"my weakness caused you pain.\\"  That is referring to the point that she indulged in something she shouldn't have and it hurt the person she was with.  That is not immature to admit your guilt.<br />This is a great cd and anyone hesitant to buy it don't be. Its awesome.
B000008B01|5.0|Sometimes referred to as The White Album (one of the few modern artists whose greatness can withstand comparison to that of the Beatles), this album was recorded sometime around 1970. Only Joao and a drummer are present, though then-girlfriend Miucha appears on one song. Somehow this album stands apart from all his others--maybe because it is so sparse, yet many of the numbers are up-tempo. He runs through &quot;Eu Vim da Bahia&quot; five times and makes it definitive. He brings a new and unexpected phrasing to &quot;Aguas de Marco.&quot; He is at his most playful on &quot;Eu Quero um Samba&quot;. And three tunes virtually do away with words altogether--&quot;Undiu&quot; finds him hypnotically chanting the title word, &quot;Valsa&quot; finds him humming a lullaby to his daughter, and an astonishing instrumental version of &quot;Na Baixa do Sapateiro&quot; finds him at his most dexterous on the guitar. It's a near-perfect album.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This movie holds up very well over time. I saw the movie in '85 in a theatre in the Back Bay of Boston and was bowled over.  It is amazing to see the raw energy of David Byrne and the gang.  Byrne goes solo on &quot;Pshycho Killer,&quot; bringing out his band one member at a time, hitting full stride on &quot;Slippery People.&quot;  He has added more percussion and some nubile back up singers to give even more umphh to the music.  Each band member reveals his or her own character with Tina Weymouth taking the lead on one selection from The Tom Tom Club. Remember them? This is one of the most satisfying concert films I've seen.  Jonathan Demme really knew how to capture the kinetic energy of David Byrne. The back stage graphics add to the post-modernist feel of this intellectual punk band, which was a big part of the CBGB scene.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I know people either love Britney or hate her. I have liked some of her work in the past but this album makes it clear that she can't sing (or think for herself). It seems as if this final desperate grab for fame will either make or brake her, but I find no reason to buy into this lackluster performance.<BR>If you want sleazy and nasty but still FUN and GOOD, try listening to &quot;Lords of Acid&quot;. Other artists can make being bad sound so good, But Britney is just a let down.<BR>Sorry
0440214041|4.0|Don't expect anything and you will be blown away. Even though Grisham partially relies on obscuring knowledge his characters already have to keep the suspense, there are enough (unknown) parties in the plot to keep you turning the pages. Read it like a movie, it should go really well with popcorn.

6305311463|4.0|Normally, the &quot;Criterion Collection&quot; is reserved for only the very best and most brilliant films but their additions of the Michael Bay blockbusters, &quot;The Rock&quot; and this, a big loud apocalyptic joy ride would indicate that even they need to make ends meet. I label Michael Bay films as a &quot;guilty pleasure&quot;. They are often big, dumb, and loud movies with predictable crowd-pleasing endings and plot holes big enough to hold &quot;an asteriod the size of Texas&quot;. Anyways if you too are a fan of these movies then you will no doubt want to add this to your collection.<br />&quot;Armageddon&quot; is everyone's favorite disaster flick gone wild with a romantic subplot tacked on to please everyone. It seems that after a violent meteor shower destroys major sections of New York that high-level NASA officials have discovered that the worst is yet to come. We've got a giant asteroid (described as a &quot;global killer&quot;) on its way here and it's up to the world's greatest deep-core driller (played by who else but Bruce Willis) to stop it. NASA seems to have pinpointed down to the last second how much exact time we have before it hits us but only Willis the hillbilly driller knows how to truly stop it.<br />After an hour of training mission montages, Willis and his group of slack-jawed sidekicks are off to do battle with the asteroid. Along the way, they lose about half of the crew and pick up a very annoying Russian astronaut. They end up landing a few miles outside of their planned destination and trouble ensues. The boys back home don't seem to have too much confidence in our heroes and want to remote detonate and call it a day. Bruce isn't having it though as he takes control of the mission and declares to anyone listening that he &quot;promised his girl he was coming home&quot;. It seems that the satellite hook-up only works when Bruce has a cheesy overwritten line to perform.<br />If you're a fan of movies that boast action and special effects over any type of sensical plot then this is your movie. This particular DVD features &quot;The Director's Cut&quot; of the movie with alternate scenes. There are some scenes that have been omitted to make way for the new stuff but hey, you can't win them all. Lawrence Tierney shows up as Bruce's dad in this new version and gives him a cheesy speech about the joys of parenthood for him to use in the &quot;alternate version&quot; of his goodbye speech to Liv Tyler. The movie also comes with a hilarious &quot;gag reel&quot; and equally-entertaining audio commentaries. Well, the actor one is good but there is one with a bunch of real-life NASA folks that just goes on and on.<br />If you enjoyed &quot;Armageddon&quot; as much as I did then you'll probably want to own this double-disc collector's edition. If not, it's only a matter of time before the good people at Criterion decide to give &quot;Con-Air&quot; it's just due.effects over any type of sensical plot then this is your movie.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has grown so much.  I'm glad she is starting to express herself more in her music. This album is her best yet! It has a little bit of something for everyone.  If you can't find a song on this c.d. that you like, then you are CRAZY!  This c.d. is a must have for everyones collection.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I have to admire the writers of Matrix Reloaded.  They actually managed to create a film that has absolutely no plot whatsoever.  I've seen infomercials and music videos with more substance than this.  Now keep in mind, I like cheesy sci-fi movies as long as they are somewhat entertaining and clever.  What we have here is a movie written on the back of a cocktail napkin.  Just some of the problems...<br />1. Never take your arch villain and replicate him hundreds of times (Agent Smith).  Not only is it silly and pointless, it takes away any menacing characteristics this villain may have had.<BR>2. Never endow your hero with superman-like powers.  If he can do anything, it takes away any suspense.<BR>3. Never intentionally obscure your plot with psycho-babble and cryptic references.<BR>4. Never make an excellent sci-fi movie and then follow it up with a peice of garbage like this.  People will no longer think you were brilliant, they will just think you got lucky.<br />I cannot even begin to emphasize how bad this movie actually was.  The more I think about it, the worse it seems.  Because of this, I avoided &quot;Revolutions&quot; altogether and I won't even go near the DVD.<br />Rent &quot;Equilibrium&quot; instead.  It is much, much better.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|The summary . . . well, it's just okay.  The whole Madonna/ Britney duet (Me Against The Music - track 1) was total bogus.  In my opinion, a bad move for Madge, but hey, they both needed a little attention and they got it . . . next. <br />She has her staple song - 2 - I Got That (Boom, Boom)- with the hip hop yelling and whooping throughout the track.  It IS cute how Britney addresses the \\"Southern Boys\\" at the very beginning, remembering her roots.<br />Tracks 3-6 are boring.  7 is pretty good -- good beat, sexy, typical.  8 is the \\"masturbation\\" song.  I guess this is a staple in every young girl's career.  I really don't see the relevance to these statement/songs.  When did it become okay and acceptable to sing about this stuff?<br />9 - The Hook Up - has a reggae feel and it's a good groove song.  Again, the underlying \\"sex\\" theme Britney has to hang on to in order to further her career.<br />10 - Shadow - is a great song.  Probably the best effort on the CD, in my opinion, as well as the only slow ballad.<br />11 - Brave New World - Is a typical girly, girly song you'd hear on a Leagally Blond soundtrack (and that does seem to be the popular opinion of that particular track). I guess she needs to throw a cute song on there to keep the little girl's parents approval.<br />And the last track - 12 - Everytime - is an obvious apology to Justin.  We all expected something like this, but let's face it . . . you deserve the \\"Cry Me A River\\" rebuttle.  We're over it and have left it behind, please let us. <br />All-in-all . . . it's just an okay CD.  Will it grow on you and I?  Sure it will.  Will it sell more than her 3rd effort \\"Britney\\"?  Nahhh . . . I don't think so.  It's just a typical, boring CD and exactly what we expected.  When are we going to let her, the little stick of sex, be?  Entertainment, yea.  Meat to grab onto and recognize . . . no way.
B00006690G|4.0|I have never bought an album of eminem's or for that matter a rap cd but since he came into the scene I have been rather curious about him as an artist. When I go into a store and hear his lyrics I have to say that I'm rather impressed that he understands just what is happening around him. Also, he isn't afraid to let parents know that he is not at fault for their kid's actions. If that's false then why don't we just get rid of t.v., music, and movies all together and forget about just blaming him. Sure, his lyrics can be very dark and perhaps offensive to a few groups of people but why not look to all of the world's media today and say that until we can identify our own problems or at least the real ones, let us leave the musicians alone. Oh and here's some advice, if you hate eminem or wish to diss him on the review board then why don't you stop buying his albums and go onto yahoo chat where you can release this pointless anger. <br />So anyway, I plan on buying this particular album and seeing if what i believe about him is correct. If not, and I found it a waste of my time then I promise not to come back here and write a bad review. Besides, rap is like seafood, you either love it or hate it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is the most powerful condemnation of substance abuse ever put on film. Darren Aronofsky has used his artistic vision first to suck you into the world of the four main characters, then to take you on their slow, inexorable plunge into the hell of addiction. Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn) is a lonely widow living in a small, modest apartment near the abandoned beaches of Coney Island. She naively views her son Harry (Jared Leto) as a \\"good boy\\", even though he keeps pawning her TV to buy heroin. Harry has a best friend, Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and a girlfriend, Marion (Jennifer Connelly) who are also into drugs. Sara's dream is to appear on television; she is obsessed with the idea and virtually addicted to a show by a self-help guru. Harry and Tyrone dream of one day making a big score, raking in a fortune and putting their financial worries behind them. Marion's dream is to design clothes and run her own business. But mind-altering chemicals cloud their judgment and dissolve all of their hopes.<br />The screenplay was co-written by Hubert Selby, Jr. and Aronofsky, adapted from Selby's novel. Aronofsky's use of unconventional film techniques, sound and music is nothing short of brilliant. He is unflinching in his portrayal of the depravity to which addicts are driven. Harry and Tyrone, though drug users and dealers, are not thugs; they are sympathetically portrayed as misguided misfits, as is Marion. When Harry and Tyrone are unexpectedly exposed to the violence inherent in the drug trade, it leads to their introduction to the criminal justice system. Marion is finally reduced to selling her body for a fix.  Meanwhile, Sara's dream to be on TV is about to come true. Her mistake is in trusting a quack doctor who prescibes amphetimines to help her lose weight fast so that she can fit into her favorite dress for the big event. She starts to over-medicate which causes irrational mood swings and eventually, hallucinations.  Ellen Burstyn's performance earned her an Oscar nomination (she should have won). By the end of the film, she is almost unrecognizable; a burned out, babbling speed freak. All four characters are reduced to self-loathing, pitiful shells of themselves, curled up in a fetal position. Their nightmarish, gut-wrenching journey is mesmerizing and disturbing. If a positive movie experience for you is a sugar-coated adventure to the land of happy endings, avoid this one.<br />The DVD is available in an R-rated and Unrated version; the unrated version has slightly more explicit sex, but nothing that impacts on the plot or the overall effect of the film.
B0000U0X1G|5.0|Not only did I think that S.W.A.T. was a great movie, but could they have cast a hotter guy in the lead role?!?!?  Colin Farrell is such a wonderful actor and is so cute!!!!

6303855466|5.0|\\"All this fuss...over what?  Is it a hill, is it a mountain?  Perhaps it wouldn't matter anywhere else, but this is Wales.\\"<br />So what happens in this epic story about the Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain?  On Sunday, 17 June 1917, cartographers/retired army officers Reginald Anson and George Garrad come to a Welsh village to measure Ffynnon Garw to determine whether it's a hill or a mountain.  Their presence causes anxiety among the villagers, who are on pins and needles when they hear the British standard of a mountain defined as anything over 1,000 feet.  The Britons stay at the inn of the cheeky Morgan the Goat (as opposed to Morgan the Sheep?), intending to leave after their task is completed.  However, guess what height Ffynnon Garw is less than?<br />The villagers put things in motion with two objectives:  one, to make sure their beloved Ffynnon Garw becomes a mountain, and two, to extend the Britons' stay, such as something involving two pounds of sugar and a gas tank, and a knife.  The first objective forms the action of the movie, villagers moving dirt from their gardens bucket by bucket, tray by tray, through toil, sweat, and sacrifice, and placing them...guess where?  And excuses for delay?  The war--take note of the date listed above.<br />There's also a conflict between the religiously fervent Reverend Jones and Morgan, as the latter doesn't go to church and plies alcohol.  When Jones asks Morgan, \\"Have you no shame?\\"  Morgan flippantly pats himself down and says \\"No, can't think where I left it\\" and walks off, leaving Jones fuming.<br />During the movie, we see that the younger Anson is more sympathetic and humble to the villagers, while the stout and older Garrod is more logical, arrogant, and looks down on the Welsh.  A typical British attitude during the period of Empire there.  Anson is also taken by Betty, a maid who comes to help Morgan tend bar and also to charm the cartographers.  It all goes back to Anglo-Welsh relations.  The Welsh have had a rough time of it all, like the Irish.  Those who survive the trenches of France return to labour only to die for coal.  Sad times indeed for the Welsh.<br />The whole point of the movie is not just the standard height set for a mountain, but Welsh pride, of national identity.  For the Welsh, all they have for monuments are mountains, no pyramids or temples.  And if Ffynonn Garw isn't a mountain, then Anson might as well redraw the map and put the Welsh in England.  After all, as Morgan tells Betty, \\"Maps are the undergarments of a country, they give shape to continents.\\"  And what's in a measurement anyway?  As Morgan says, \\"Do we call a short man a boy or a small cat a dog? No! This is a mountain, our mountain, and if it needs to be a thousand feet, then by God let's make it a thousand feet!E In other words, it's all relative.<br />The concept of telling the village people with identical surnames by their occupation or personality is ingenious and charming, so we can tell the difference between Williams the Petroleum from Williams the Deaf.  Some are more telling, as in the case of Johnny Shellshock.  And there are the Thomas Twps:  Thomas Twp and his brother Thomas Twp 2.  As one of them says, \\"we've no learning than most, so people say we're twp, but we're not twp as to not know that we're twp.\\"  Right, that makes sense.<br />All the leads are splendid, particularly Colm Meaney as Morgan the Goat and Kenneth Griffith as the strict but passionate Reverend Jones.  And Hugh Grant (Anson) has another charming leading lady, Tara Fitzgerald (Betty), who ranks up there with Andie McDowell (Four Weddings) and Martine McCutcheon (Love Actually).  She really has a winning smile and saucy brogue that makes her character lovable.  And darn if Ian Hart keeps popping up, be it Harry Potter, Michael Collins, and now here, as Johnny Shellshock.<br />A wonderful little movie with a wonderful Celtic score, as the ideas and themes that emerge make this more than a one-joke movie.  And for you boyos, this was written by Hamlow_the_Writer_Who_Went_Up_A_Paragraph_But_Climbed_Down_A_Review.ore than a one-joke movie.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|After a string of disappointing albums lasting over a decade IM has finally hit the mark. This is easily the best album since Powerslave.
B0000C1733|4.0|I am a huge RHCP fan.  I've seen them live 3 times and I love almost all of their songs.  Of course, if I were to make my own &quot;definitive RHCP mix&quot;, it would differ from this.  It seems that the other reviewers would like to fault the band for releasing a greatest hits CD that has different songs than their own mix would have if they were to make one.  This is silly.  That being said, this collection strikes me as an excellent buy for two types of people: 1. Those who like RHCP's more recent work but haven't bought their last 4 or 5 CD's, either because they don't like them THAT much, or because they don't have much disposable CD buying income : ).  2. Those who have heard a song here and there, liked it, and want to hear a little bit more of what this band has to offer.  If you fall into one of these categories, then this CD is probably what you've been looking for.  <BR>P.S. To the other reviewers: Geez, it's not like they left off &quot;Give It Away&quot;!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|To say that &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; the new release from the quintessential rock band of the 90's and today is a collection of B-sides and cut material is impossible and redundant.  Fact of the matter is Lost Dogs sounds and feels like vintage Pearl Jam which we all know and love so well...the feeling you get when you hear Eddie's voice from the early 90's, in songs you've never heard...is a feeling I haven't had for a while.  Elation and wonder comes to mind...this album is amazing the 1st disc ROCKS and the 2nd disc Acousticly ROLLS...what a journey, many years and cheers to you Pearl Jam, thanks for the incredible talent and inspiration.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Wow.  I just finished listening to this album straight through, all 111 minutes of it.  All I can say is wow.  This is the Pearl Jam at their best.  Every song is simply amazing.  This album is a must have if your a Pearl Jam fan, and if your not, I still recommend you get it if you like them even a tiny bit because this is just a ludacrisly awesome cd.
B00005JMFR|3.0|I thought the movie was brilliant, but each film has fallen to<BR>progressively less and less in terms of overall impact since the original...<br />This in my opinion is due to the Wachowski brothers not having any more original sources to draw on -they know what I mean by that statement..(Can we say NT?)<br />In any case, I missed the enigmatic presence of Gloria Foster as the Oracle. She was one of my favorite aspects of the first two movies,and while her substitute did well,she paled in comparison with the original much like the two sequels did in comparison to the original Matrix movie..<BR> <BR>It seems as if the Wachowski brothers have increasingly depended <BR>on special effects in lieu of philosphical epiphany,and this \\"final\\" movie personifies this to a tee..<BR>Not to take anything away from the special effects,as they are no doubt the best in the biz at this time. No doubt the Matrix series will be watched again and again by new generations,just as we currently watch the Wizard of Oz like our grandparents did..<br />But..I just left the theater feeling empty ,like the story was unresolved somehow..I don't know if this was due to my not wanting the trilogy to end as much as it was my sense that the scene was being set for yet another sequel..<br />For the vast majority of people,they will hail this as the best in the series ,but for those of us that like to have our thoughts provoked and our minds blown wide open,we will likely walk away less than impressed ..
B000063UV9|5.0|I can't believe this movie was made in 1969. But then I look at how YOUNG Newman and Redford are in the film and how craggy and `well-seasoned' they look now and figure, yeah, that was a long time ago. The pairing of these two actors was brilliant; the chemistry between them, the way they can play off each other's strengths, was recaptured years later in The Sting.<BR>BC and the SDK starts of as a loopy set piece of two giddy train robbers just living from one holdup to the next one - but then they rob the wrong guy and he hires a world-class tracker (\\"Who ARE those guys?\\") who just won't give up. They keep running - all the way to Bolivia.<BR>And okay, maybe the bicycle scene in the meadow with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is schmaltzy - but didn't you love it? And don't you remember that scene every time you hear the song on the radio?<BR>A movie really doesn't get much better than this.
B000002AOD|5.0|This is what I was waiting for all life long:). After listening to &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; soundtracks I thought there would be nothing able to charm me the same way, give me the chills and so on. But the deeper I dive into the jazz land, the more beautiful compositions and songs and artists I find. Michel Camilo is on one of the highest places in my personal ranking.<br />And this CD is so full of fire, it burns brains and kicks ears. It's wondeful.
B00003CXD0|5.0|Dustin Hoffman can do any role (well, maybe not a drool-all-over-me romantic lead), and he does each one sooo well, including the `idiot savant' in Rainman. In Tootsie, made in the 80s, Hoffman disguises himself as a middle-aged woman to land a part in a TV soap opera. He gets the job, but his biggest reward is getting to see the way the world treats women.<BR>Dabney Coleman plays the laconic roommate with deadpan humor, and Geena Davis, before anyone knew who she was, plays the confused girlfriend.<BR>If you haven't seen it, rent it now. And force your male teenager to watch it, too; besides the fact that he'll enjoy it, it also might scrub some of the macho obnoxiousness off his act.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Hi<br />I too have been awaiting the release of this DVD for the past year.  I was VERY lucky to be present at the Royal Albert Hall last year and see the spectacle unfold live before my eyes ... and what a tremendous night it was.  <br />The DVD is on my Christmas wants list, as I'm sure it will also be for everyone lucky enough to be there.  I shall savour every second on the morning of 25th December. I have no doubts that the DVD is as good as people are saying - it was a very moving experience being there last year, and I'm am sure the DVD will bring all those feelings flooding back.<br />My only hopes are that the Sam Brown &quot;Horse To The Water&quot; track (incidentally, it was George's last recording for the Jools Holland &quot;Big Band Small World&quot; double CD, as someone else has asked here) is reinstated, as it was cut from the double CD version - why, I have no idea! Also, there were a few vocal and guitar &quot;fixes&quot; on the CD version, so I'll be listening to see if they are corrected on the DVD soundtrack too (I'd prefer it to be honest as on the historical night, although can also understand if they have corrected them purely for listening pleasure).<br />All in all it was a marvellous evening, and I'm sure, from what everyone else has said in their reviews, it will be a joy for me to behold once more very soon. <br />Rest In Peace George, you WERE there that night last year, and not only in the guise of your son Dhani.
B00005U18E|4.0|I really, really, really didn't like the book, so I was exceedingly reluctant to see the movie - but wow, it's so much better than I expected. One of those rare cases in which the book falls short of the movie. The book: I just wanted Bridget to quit kvetching  and obsessing about every single thing and get on with her life; it was too repetitive. The Movie: charming! A lot had to do with the actors: Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant, and Colin Firth.<BR>It's hard to steal a movie from Grant, but Zellweger manages to do it by playing an inept misfit in society, always foot-in-mouth, off key, dressed wrong - and lusting after the wrong guy. Just in case you haven't see it or read other reviews, I won't mention who the wrong guy is.<BR>Order a pizza, pour a beer, kick off your shoes, and have a fun evening. It's not great cinema (and it sure wasn't great literature), but it's way fun.
B00005JM0B|5.0|This is a third segment of the Terminator definately lived up to my expectations. The action and the humor factor were enough to make me want to see it and buy it for my collection. After 20yrs the man Arnold Schwarzenegger has still got it.
6300182282|5.0|Filmed at Heritage House, a sprawling Bed &amp; Breakfast on California's Mendocino Coast, Same Time Next year features Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn as an adulterous couple who, over a quarter of a century, meet annually for a weekend at the same hideaway. Besides spanning the lives of this couple, who are each married-with-family, the film also spans some of the most convulsive, tumultuous, and confusing years of the country's history.<BR>Beautiful, tasteful, and worth watching again and again.

B000002MI4|4.0|I give this a forth star because I still pull it out for the occasional listen. But it remains one of the most difficult CD's in Elvis' careening musical experimentation. What usually happens is I find myself wondering where these songs would have fit had they been recorded for other Costello albums. &quot;Jacksons Monk and Rowe&quot; obviously would have made it as a &quot;Get Happy&quot; song. &quot;For Other Eyes;&quot; &quot;Imperial Bedroom.&quot; A folksy arrangement might have sent &quot;Damnation's Cellar&quot; to &quot;King Of America.&quot; And so on and so forth....<br />But the song sequence works wonderfully and the playing of the Brodskies never sinks to pedestrian. These folks obviously understood that they were going to have to throw preconceived ideas about playing with a &quot;rocker,&quot; just as Elvis was trying to (as he put it) avoid the dreaded &quot;crossover&quot; sound. My major gripe with the album is that Elvis' voice isn't always up to the task (&quot;North&quot; fares much better in that department). And anyone looking for a &quot;typical&quot; Costello platter is in for a major shock. Of course, anyone trying to define a &quot;typical&quot; Costello disc is probably going to have a rough go of it.....<br />That doesn't stop &quot;The Juliet Letters&quot; from featuring some fine work, including &quot;The Birds Will Still Be Singing,&quot; which deserves a shot with a voice like Josh Groban's or Michael Buble's. Or maybe now that Elvis has his new beau, she'll do a full set of her favorites from the Costello/MacManus discography. Now wouldn't THAT be a hoot?
B00004Y87O|5.0|John Carpenter was an enormously successful director during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Unfortunately, his influence has dropped off to some extent in recent years, but once he was king of the hill with \\"Halloween,\\" \\"The Thing,\\" \\"The Fog,\\" and this massively entertaining science fiction romp, \\"Escape From New York.\\" If \\"Halloween\\" launched dozens of imitators in the years following its release, \\"Escape From New York\\" saw even more cheap knock offs hoping to capitalize on the success of the original. The Italians especially borrowed heavily from Carpenter's little gem in order to create such dreadfully low budget films as \\"2019: The Fall of New York,\\" \\"Escape From the Bronx,\\" and several others. I think the only other sci-fi films that rated an equivalent level of imitation were \\"Aliens\\" and \\"The Road Warrior.\\" Yes, this low budget film was that successful in the early 1980s, and a recent viewing confirmed once again why a story about a future where the United States government turns New York into a prison is so much fun. \\"Escape From New York\\" boasts a stellar cast: Kurt Russell, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton, Isaac Hayes, Donald Pleasence, Adrienne Barbeau, and Lee Van Cleef all appear at various times throughout the film. This movie may not be the Mecca of science fiction films, but it sits securely near the top of the genre.<br />Nearly anyone who likes these types of movies ought to know the plot line of this one by now. The president of the United States, played by a surprisingly low key Donald Pleasence, is on his way to an important conference that may ease tensions between our country and the Soviet Union. Our leader needs peace because the United States suffers from a host of internal problems, the least of which is the need for a prison the size of New York. A terrorist group hijacks the president's plane and crashes it into the middle of New York, but not before the leader of the free world manages to eject in an escape pod. The authorities are at a loss about what they should do to retrieve the chief executive until they learn that the legendary Snake Plissken (Russell, of course) is in the process of being admitted to the prison. Snake, a sneering, laconic individual who has a problem with authority figures at first rebuffs the attempts of the prison administration to save the president. He changes his tune when he learns that the authorities are willing to kill him if he refuses. Moreover, the placing of small explosive charges in Snake's neck insures that he will make a serious effort to finish the mission or die in the attempt. Our hero has twenty-four hours to get in, find the president, and get him out before his the charges explode.<br />Plissken flies into the prison on a glider, lands on top of one of the World Trade Center towers, and begins to explore the blasted landscapes of urban New York City. What follows is a madcap race against the clock to rescue the president. Along the way, Snake meets a polka loving cabbie (Borgnine), an old colleague who double-crossed him named Brain (Stanton), Brain's sexy moll (Barbeau), and an ominous figure called \\"The Duke of New York\\" (Hayes). Predictably, the Duke has the president and plans to use this advantage to escape from prison. Plissken has other ideas, and as the bullets fly and the bodies fall, he gets closer and closer to his objective. Twenty four hours elapse pretty darn fast when your life is on the line. I am not giving anything away when I tell you that Snake makes his deadline in the nick of time. The fun comes from watching how he does it. \\"Escape From New York\\" bristles with double crosses, over the top posturing, snappy dialogue, cool set pieces, and roller coaster pacing. Throw in a gladiatorial combat sequence between Snake and a hulking behemoth, complete with spike studded baseball bats and garbage can lid shields, and you just know you have a winner with this one.<br />\\"Escape From New York\\" would not have been nearly as much fun asit is without the excellent cast. Donald Pleasence, except for one memorable scene near the end, plays the president with restraint. Russell is both hilarious and sinister as the ambiguous hero Snake Plissken, a former soldier turned criminal (nearly everyone is a criminal in this futuristic United States) who only wants the authorities to leave him alone but finds himself pulled into the middle of another mess. Seeing Ernest Borgnine here may surprise some viewers, but this actor made many lower budget films at this point in his career. His turn as the boisterous cabbie who knows the streets of New York like the back of his hand is enjoyable to watch. Barbeau, who also appeared in Carpenter's \\"The Fog,\\" adds her own unique gifts to the picture. Carpenter pulls great performances out of his cast, making \\"Escape From New York\\" more of an ensemble picture than merely a vehicle for then rising star Kurt Russell.<br />This disc belongs on the shelf of every science fiction fan. The DVD version I watched unfortunately did not have much in the way of extras, something this film desperately needs. Thankfully, a special edition release containing commentaries, deleted scenes, documentaries, and a few other goodies is on the way soon. If this new release is similar to the one they did for \\"The Fog,\\" I think we will be in for a real treat. \\"Escape From New York\\" may not be as well known as Carpenter's early horror efforts, but it is a must see none the less.it is without the excellent cast.

B00006ZCFH|3.0|My hand is raised up in the air for Ms. Badu - an artist in every true sense of the word. We follow you througout your career, with each self-reinvention... &quot;Worldwide...&quot; is merely another half-step towards a new Erykah. Half-step, of course, referring to the shorter-than-anticipated length of this new project. As a more devoted fan, I couldn't help but wince through some of the more uncomfortable, lyrical moments. Yet the freedom she expresses somehow floats me through.

6300214435|4.0|\\"Temple of Doom\\" takes a lot of heat from fans and enemies of the Indian Jones Trilogy alike.  Many complain about its dark-quality and its overemphasis of action, but personally I find it more enjoyable to watch than \\"Raiders.\\"  I enjoy the somewhat darker tones of this film; I can remember this movie scaring me more as a child than \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" did.  Additionally, I think Spielberg and Lucas were up to form in this film (though, admittedly not as smooth as they were on the final film).  Harrison Ford appears to have finally discovered who Indiana truly is.  While the movie does lack a developed villain, Indiana Jones gets more character development.  The addition of Shortround gives the film a different feel too; once again, we see our big action star being aided and saved by a young child (far from the perfect action heroes that have graced the screens in recent years).<br />The opening sequence of this film-involving a musical set piece, dancing, and a good old-fashioned gunfight-is one of the best sequences in the entire trilogy.  Watching Indiana scramble around for the antidote after being poisoned is wonderfully done and strung out.  Additionally, the sequence in the room full of spikes (particularly when the sequence goes into a mini-repeat) is hilarious and exciting.  And although the Indiana girl in this film (played by Kate Capshaw) becomes quickly annoying, the characters in the film are equally annoyed as the audience.<br />All around, \\"Temple of Doom\\" knows what it is doing and has the whole show more organized and choreographed than the first film.  If you haven't seen this film, get it.  You'll thank me.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I wrote a review awile back.This album has generated a heated response both pro ahd con.The BEATLES are one of the greatest and most influentual bands in rocknroll history.I would reccomend reading the book 'GET BACK:THE UNAUTHORIZED CHRONICLE OF THE BEATLES' LET IT BE DISASTER by Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt.It will shed light on this releases' troubled history.It chronicles every song the group recorded and attempted to record in the GET BACK sessions.I read it and its not surprising THE BEATLES broke up.What I find amazing is the group would record ABBEY ROAD after these sessions as their swan song.
B000089RVR|2.0|Well No Angel had passion and some nice delivery aside its occasional snooze that still left it well rounded and with deffinate appeal. This album just has no guts. Dido needs to cut out the contemporary... her voice seems made to compliment faster music being that it is so mellow. Dido should have done more of what her brother was doing and add some progressive house and downtempo/bass-heavy music rather then teasing us all with its likeness that goes astray. Oh well I think this is about the last chance I'll give Dido so forget it. This album is a spark that catches no fire. <br />The lyrics are also extremely dissapointing. Whine about something with more then personal love and trust issues... this is so selfish by its introvert and narrow coherency. Why not cry about how cruel the world is to eachother and &quot;how and what can be done and what you can do to better it?&quot;!!!! Laugh at what I said all you want but how often do you hear people talking about what possitivity, creativity and discipline they posses? Does anyone think of more then thier life of victimhood?!?!?!
B00005AR3G|3.0|First, I want to congratulate the excellent Disney animation staff for doing an incredible job at acting and moving the drawings in this movie.  Some of the best I've seen recently from the House of Mouse.<br />However, among other things, this movie just HURTS.  It reminds me of stale Disney animated films from my childhood (Robin Hood) when the creative direction at the Disney studio hit serious speedbumps.  Notably, SO much meaningless dialogue.  Serious boredom for most kids, I would think.  The beats of the story, and the contrasts of characters and situations were shrouded in a haze.  Also, the designs of the backgrounds and color choices made the entire film a kind of cartoony malaise of images.  Why can't Disney juxtapose designs and contrast characters, dialogue and sequences to keep the audience in awe anymore?  I want the keen Disney sensabilities of Jungle Book or Little Mermaid back in full gear, not sloppy journey's through incoherent fantasy realities beyond public perceptions or common archetypes.  And on a filmic note, why can't the story guys at Disney establish things with wide shots and sweeping pans anymore?  Or use terrificly thoughtful transitions (there were a couple nice ones in GROOVE, tho)?  And why is the camera always locked in some of the most boring positions that careras were set in before the age of cranes and dollies??  The flat film negating perspective (thus believable reality) is annoying for such a brilliant crew of art talents.  Disney has so much possibility, but so little is used.<br />Overall, this film was pretty hard to watch in one sitting as scenes drug on and became self indulgent fun.  But, it wasn't anything most viewers would notice consciously.  I hope the talent making the movie gets restructured around better scripts and storyboarding to raise the flag of excellence flying half mast at Disney these days.
0783107854|5.0|I have always loved both Donald Sutherland and Stephen Rea so it was a dream come true to see them together in such a great film.<br />The movie is about how the ex U.S.S.R.'s soviet government couldn't admit that the perfect Russian society they had created could produce such a thing as a serial killer and was therefore quite unable to catch him - how can you find a solution when you are not allowed to acknowledge that the problem exists?<br />But a relatively unimportant man, through mind boggling perseverance and patience, never gives up on catching the murderer.<br />Superbly done.
B00008J4P5|2.0|This was the first album the White Stripes made after breaking through to the mainstream and becoming inescapable in music magazines, so it was obviously not a surprise that it was their most widely-anticipated album to date. However, all of this excitement seems to have clouded everyone's judgment of the record, because this is easily the White Stripes' weakest effort. That's not to say it's a bad album, but it's certainly not close to what Rolling Stone, Spin, and most of the reviewers here have made it out to be. &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, the most overplayed single of 2003 (possibly of the millenium thus far) was boring in the first place, the song with Meg on vocals sucks, the song at the end with Holly Golightly is completely unnecessary, and the rest of it just sounds like boring, uninspired rehashes of the band's past work (especially &quot;There's No Home For You Here&quot;, which was much better when they called it &quot;Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground&quot;). This is NOT the best album of 2003, it is NOT this band's crowning acheivement, and it is certainly NOT a classic (and this is coming from someone who loves their first three albums). This album gets one and a half stars for the songs I like (&quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot;, &quot;I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself&quot;, &quot;Black Math&quot;), and another half for the fact that it at least sounds the way real rock music should (rough and sloppy, not glossy, shiny and polished) and I can imagine how great this must sound if you're 13 and the only rock you've been exposed to is Limp Bizkit or something. &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;, &quot;De Stijl&quot; and the self-titled debut (my personal favorite) are all much, much better than this.
B00005JKEZ|4.0|When I was a kid this was my favorite movie. Olivia de Havilland was the most beautiful woman in the world and Errol Flynn was my dream boat.<br />I've watched it more recently, in a colorized version and it's still very entertaining, although now my heart beats very still while watching it. I just can't take it seriously any more, and now prefer Mel Brook's take on the myth.<br />I've found Errol Flynn a lot more ridiculous but still surprisingly seductive. What a haircut! What a laugh! And what about those tights? \\"We're men! We're men in tiiiiights!....\\"<br />Too bad I can't stand Olivia's very dated performance any more, her puppy sad eyes expressions, teen age sighs and silly tantrums. She's always over acting. The only thing that consoles me a little is her wonderful figure and the ridiculous but glamorous shiny dresses she wears.
B00004W4UB|5.0|I have come across many films with Julia Roberts, but I didn't find any of the films (nor Julia's performances) very notable or memorable, not even Erin Brokovich.  I never for a moment thought I would see Julia give a quietly powerful, deeply convincing performance in a role we much sympathize with, nor be able to completely change the tone of her American voice to an Irish accent.  This was until I saw MARY REILLY.  I was most pleasantly surprised when I discovered the Julia Roberts that's been seemingly hidden for so long.  There was not a moment in this film that I was convinced that she was Julia Roberts.  She was absolutely NO Julia Roberts in this film.  She is Dr. Jekyll's dearly devoted maid Mary Reilly, the woman who suffered years of brutal abuse from her father and had the decency to abandon her nightmarish past and find a new and better life for herself.<br />I have to note that John Malkovich did a good job as Dr. Jekyll, but his big problem was that he lacked the ability to speak with a proper English accent, which leaves you far from convinced that he's an Englishman.  In that case, he is outshone by Julia Roberts, who, as an Irish woman, does her Irish accent superbly.<br />Now, back to Julia.  As I said earlier, she most definitely deserved an Oscar for this performance.  She played Mary with as much grace, charisma and frailty as could be possible.  This is without a doubt the performance of her entire career.  If you Oscar people can't even nominate an actress for an Oscar for an exceptional, Oscar-worthy performance, at least give her the praise she's entitled to.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Peter Jackson must think blue is the new black, and decided to make a black and white movie in mostly shades of blue.<br />The movie doesn't give you the same feel that the book does and turns some of it's characteristics into flaws. I still remember a movie critic saying that she didn't understand why Frodo's friend and companion kept calling him \\"Mr. Frodo\\". That's a mistake easy to understand, when one realizes that the hierarchy that one naturally accepts while reading the book somehow isn't translated into the picture.<BR>When, in \\"The Two Towers\\" the king says that a certain type of flower always grows on the tombs of his family I instantly and democratically wonder why only his ancestor's dead bodies are untitled to a special brand of flowers. That thought never even crossed my mind while reading the book.<br />Ian Mckellen is not the Gandalf I envisioned. It is not enough to be old and to look old to get away as an authority figure, no matter how easy Christopher Lee might make it look. Gandalf the character is more of a robust and manly giant, with a gravitas that Ian doesn't have, in this film or any other.<br />I always imagined Cate Blanchet's character more in the lines of someone like Robin Wright somehow (don't ask me why). Blanchet's wig and Spock like ears do her beauty no favors, as neither does the invisible make-up, or the way it was decided she should play the character, making it come across as a thoroughly disagreeable, suspicious looking type you should be weary of, not as a fascinating, angelically divine woman. That said, the moment when she is tempted to take the ring in the first \\"Lord of the Rings\\" is superb. There's no such glorious moment for her here.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is indispensable because of:<br />- A moment of sheer poetry, when Liv Tyler's father explains why she must forget Aragorn.<br />- Wormtongue. Whatever Brad Dourif does is always outstanding. <br />- Gollum, the most amazing piece of acting that I've seen in a longwhile. If there was any justice in the world, they would have created a special Oscar just for him.<br />- And the Orchs' argument about how it wouldn't hurt to just eat a tiny piece of their prisioner's bodies. It's something no one should miss.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido delivers again.  While this is not quite a 5 star album, it suffices.  Dido, the sultry Euro-rocker spins out some sweet tunes on this CD.  Good for the women in your life for Christmas, or your metrosexual male friends.  Dido has a spunk to her that carries through in her music, this album is no exception.  B+<br />Joseph Dworak
B000099T2L|5.0|What more can I say then excellent. On her first solo cd. B has done it big. I love her and her music and her style. She is like no other and so is her music. Crazy in Love awesome song and it has every shaking their tailfeathers. Baby Boy another hit that is good for dancing. There are alot of slow songs on the album. Most are about love. And her next single Me, Myself, and I is about being an independent woman. Hip Hop Star featuring Big Boi and Sleepy Brown is a catchy tune and you can hear Beyonce singing differently. Using the wonderful talents god gave her. Go GET IT NOW! It's A+ for a solo debut album and she is to bring you more. The album will leave you satisfied trust me. It'll leave you feeling Crazy in Love.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay, no sophomore slump here, amazing recording, cutting edge British rock.  You will not go wrong, if you liked Parachutes, you will dig these tracks.  &quot;Clocks&quot; is just a gem of a single and the piano digs to your core.  Check it out-  A<br />Joseph Dworak
B00006AW2G|5.0|The sound on the new SACD is flawless.  It's like dropping the needle on the record.  Worth the money just for \\"Gimmie Shelter\\" but throw in \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"Love In Vain\\", \\"Contry Honk\\" and the rest and you have a \\"must own\\" CD.
B00004W52U|5.0|My title could quite possibly be true. Why? The band has only put out 1 widely released recording and has been broken up more than 13 years and every punk is still listening to them. Being from the Bay Area i assume that OPIV is more popular here than most otehr places ... but when you go to a punk show you see more OPIV shirts, patches, hats whatever than any other band merch (besides teh one playing). <br />The band is like Jesus ... more popular dead then when alive.<br />BUY THIS NOW ... then read the rest of this.<br />OPIV plays ska and punk and punk/ska. This whole CD is charged with a ton of energy and the lyrical content is great. Good messages, good music ... some people complain about the quality, but you gotta rember this was put out on Lookout records a long time ago ... old + indie label = not great quality. but you can still make out every drums beat, guitar note, bass riff and lyric.<br />This band has spawned a lot of followers. Its 100% amazing and you honestly cant be a punk rocker without owning this.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Superb! - Enjoyable from start to finish - Great idea of including both the movie and the ENTIRE concert - Reverant and Irreverant - The Indian music is so good I didn't even fast forward - The Pythons are perfect and of course George's band was dead on - Too many highlights to mention.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|I am a huge Beatle fan. So, that being said and with all the hype around this CD I was expecting a lot more. All of the songs are virtually as they were on the original recordings. Yes, there are some slight difference in mix, guitar riffs and some lyrics. But they are low key differences and will not blow you away. If you are not a big Beatle fan you may not even notice. Biggest difference is Long & Winding Road without the Phil Spector orchestration. My reaction? A big shrug and a ho-hum. The second disc are snippets from the movie, i.e., chatter, incidental music, etc. All in all, is this a must have disc to listen to versus the original Let It Be recording? No. As a collectible? Yes. It's worth owning as a historical document especially if you are really into Beatle history.
B00005R87Q|5.0|What is it about this movie?  So many people dismiss it as just another mindless race movie, when it's so much more.<br />What do I see?  As someone born and raised in Southern California, I see a stylized, but faithful, version of where I live: people of different (and mixed) ethnicities, the frictions that develop from diverse cultures and values, the &quot;haves&quot; and the &quot;have-nots&quot; addressing their economic needs in legal, &quot;gray&quot; and illegal ways.  And, what is the common denominator that bring all these people together?  They (we) all love their (our) cars!  The cars are rolling expressions (metaphors?) of who the characters are and, more importantly, who they want to be.  You don't get more SoCal than that!<br />Yes, it was the cars, the racing and the action that initially drew me to F&amp;F.  To get all that, plus a clear-eye look at contemporary life in SoCal, elevates this movie to classic status.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Members of Rage against the machine collaborating with legendary Chris Cornell of soundgarden - that could be exciting.<BR>But sadly it sounds like some remake of their old songs.i don't know who's fault is it but &quot;Chochise&quot; and some tracks that are closest to hteir older style are simply boring.<BR>the best tracks i found here were more catchy and modern rock that agressive riff-shouting rage melodies.&quot;Like a stone&quot;,&quot;I am a highway&quot; and &quot;What you are&quot; are really great rock tunes with a lot of great rhythm section and guitars.Chris Cornell on vocals sounds really superb there.<BR>as a whole album Audioslave made something that sounds great only in few moments.the rest is good but totally what you could expect 5 years ago from Rage against the machine.that is why it is boring a bit - only once you can make revolution in rock music - when repeated it starts to be unoriginal and sleepy.That's what hapened to audioslave.good music but nothing brand new. buy or not - the chioce is yours...
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I've been a Dream Theater fan since their 1st album came out, and they are still my favorite band. This album is nearly the worst, though. The last one was worse than this, I think. If you want to hear DT at their best, pick up Images and Words, or Metropolis, Change of Seasons, or Awake. <br />This album is shallow, plain, mechanical, and soulless, compared to earlier albums. Some parts of the songs are very basic, not well thought out, rythm patterns --sounding more like Metallica. Some parts are repetitious and you just want to fast forward. <br />I love James LaBrie (Vocals), but his vocal melodies on this album sounded like everything else he's ever sung. He even follows the guitar melody in parts (like he was asleep at the wheel during the recordings). He sings a lot on the root note, over and over. I think the band would be better served finding a new vocalist. LaBrie is more creative on his Mullmuzzler albums.<br />The guitar work is faster and more precise than ever. Almost robotic. About as much soul and feeling as a robot, too. His older solos had so much emotion. His guitar rythms and melodies sound rehashed from other parts, now. Nothing vaguely new and original. The hands are fast but the brain is tired. <br />The last couple of albums lack the passion and fire of previous songwriting. They sound very uninspired. It shows that the album was written in 3.5 weeks. Even the bad DT albums had at least one song on them that blew you away. Not this one. There are many that will give this album 5 stars simply b/c it's DT. They are the best metal band on the planet, even at their worst moments. I'm giving it one star to bring down the average of those who overrate DT. These guys need some time away from eachother to find inspiration again. Less side projects with their own members, too. On an unrelated note --The new Seven Dust album is awesome, though.
B000000H57|5.0|Comparing Type's &quot;Octpber rust&quot; to many other gothic metal album is pointless - &quot;October rust&quot; Holds the crown because of endless pain and sadness in all songs combined with gloomy atmosphere,heavy guitars and sometimes nice suprises like funny &quot;My girlfriend's girlfriend&quot; and amazing bass line in &quot;Be my druides&quot;.very atmospheric and dark - not for weak listeners.<BR>it is also full of magic - listening to it you can imagine pagan rituals and things like that.strongly recomended for metal fans and for people who want to discover something more than powerfull riffs and loud vocals.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I have read many bad reviews about this album and I really dont know what the hell are these guys talking about.<BR>This is really good album.<BR>Its much darker and heavier than any other DT release but still progressive.<BR>Guitar and keyboard solos are amazing, it makes you think if John and Jordan are Gods.<BR>Every song except &quot;Vacant&quot; is good, its not even 3 mins long, so for me its not like a real song..........more like a bunch of tones to fill the CD. hehehe<BR>The truth is that this album reminds a bit of Metallica and that is the reason it got only 4 stars from me.<BR>Its not their best release............. nothing can compare with &quot;Awake&quot; and &quot;Images and Words&quot; but still, its a GREAT album and if you are DT and prog fan you should buy it.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|for everyone who want to know Pg music and for everyone who want to have only 1 Peter Gabriel album &quot;Hit&quot; is a great choice.featuring many important songs,few new ones (&quot;Downside up&quot;,&quot;Growing up&quot;,unreleased &quot;Lovetown&quot; it igves a portrait of an amazing artist who creates such a rich,powerfull and gentle in the same time and also catchy music.<BR>the only thing that i complain is that &quot;In your eyes&quot; (from &quot;so&quot;) is missing here and also some songs from very good although underrated second album &quot;Scratch&quot; (Where is &quot;DIY&quot;,&quot;On the air&quot; or &quot;Mother of voilence&quot;? these are fantastic songs!)<br />but anyway - it's very good (but maybe not definitive as it says on cover),it fits perfectly the gap between compitations like &quot;Shaking the tree - 16 golden greats&quot; (1978 - 1990) and &quot;Growing up live tour dvd &quot; (many tracks from 1992 - 2003) with nice addition of few new tracks.i am sure it will be a worldwide Hit!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well...what can I say?!  When I picked up Ms. \\"Sexy\\" Spears' In The Zone I didn't know what I was in for.  I did expect one or two good tracks, having read in advance in a magazine that Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs, R.Kelly and Moby were producing tracks on it.  I thought it would be like her \\"Britney\\" album a few RnB based tunes a la \\"Slave\\" and \\"Boys\\" and the rest pop!  But to my surprise more were RnB and hardly any sign of pop music that she first started her career with.  <br />I'd like to state that the content and music influence on this album are mature and not really something youngsters aged 15 and under will like...that is unless they like RnB.<br />Here's a rundown of the tracks...<br />1.  Me against the music feat Madonna<BR>U know this 1.  I dont really like this, however I do like the parts that she sings fast...very hott!<br />2.  (I got that) Boom boom feat Ying Yang Twins<BR>This is the first RnB/hip-hop laced track.  The music's really good with a little cameo by country instrument the \\"Banjo\\",  the twins ad lib the whole track.<br />3.  Showdown<BR>A shocker!  Very RnB sounds Neptuney.  Ms. Spears talks the verses in a sexy tone and sings the chorus in a very un-pre-britney.  Top class.<br />4.  Breathe on me<BR>Fantastic!  This is a very fusion slow dance/club track.  Reminds you of Madonna's Bedtime story and Inside of me and Kylie Minogues stuff.  Very silky, soft, sexyily sung vocals, u won't believe its her!<br />5.  Early mornin'<BR>Moby produced track.<br />An ok song the verses are spoken and chorus sung, the track isn't strong.  I prefer the verses 2 the choruses.<br />6.  Toxic<BR>The song is up-beat, a party song that you would hear at a well thrown party.  The music is laced with the \\"Bollywood\\" music we are all so used 2 now having listened 2 it from artists like Missy, Timbaland, Aaliyah (RIP my baby), Nivea, Justin T etc.<BR>The chorus is sung very un-britney like which again is a plus point.<br />7.  Outrageous<BR>R.Kelly produced track.<BR>This song is unbelievable!  Hott song.  Feat R on backgroung vocals this is tiiiight!  Very Netuney includin' an Araby vibe in the music.  No one will believe you when u tell em it's Britney!<br />8.  Touch of my hand<BR>Yeah, for all of you that have heard rumours about what this song is about have heard right.  It is about mast**bation.  And you'll be shocked to hear the words come out of Britney's mouth.  She ain't little girl no more.<BR>Music is fusion with chinese strings all the way through.<br />9.  The hook up<BR>A chppy dancehall/bashment/RnB tune with Ragga adlibs.  Doesn't sound like britney in the verses that much but once the chorus arrives you know it's her singin'.  A good song, not brilliant.<br />10.  Shadow<BR>Produced by Avril Lavigne's group the Matrix.  This song is slow and more along the lines of what the pop fans of Britney are used to.  It's slow, poppy and uses the Indian instrument \\"Sitar\\" during the chorus.  Very, very reminicent to Avril's \\"I'm with you\\".<br />11.  Brave new girl<BR>This track is really eighties.  U can imagine people with ghetto blasters on their shoulders, convertables in the summer, kids playin' rope on the pavement, and adidas trainers and sweat suits lol.  <BR>The verses are really good with her lil singy rappy style (It's sung like Pink's \\"RESPECT\\") the chorus is too girly 4 my likin' though.  Would suit the \\"Clueless\\" movie and show perfectly.  I love clueless btw, show and movie!  LOL!<br />12.  Everytime<BR>Hate this!  Way too pop, it's really bad.  Apparently it's about Justin T.  Slow song.<br />13.  Me against the music feat Madonna (Rishi's remix)<BR>So this is the London based Producer Rishi Rish's remix.  He's of Indian race (Like me and I know him) and lives in London (Like me also).  He's only 24 and has been producing tracks since the age of 17. The beats he has used are that of the \\"Panjabi\\" culture called \\"Bhangra\\".  Missy used some instruments used in Bhangra music on \\"Get ur freak on\\".<br />UK Bonus Tracks...<br />14.  The answer<BR>Produced by Sean \\"Puffy\\" Combs.  This track is slow RnB/hip-hop with the Indian instrument \\"Tabla\\" used as the main source.  Sounds a mix of Sean and Neptunes.  A great track.  Non-fans will like it.<br />15.  Don't hanf up<BR>This track is slow UK drum n bassy/slow 2 stepy.  Her vocals are once again really silky and smooth.  U won't believe it's her, doesn't sound anythin' like her at all.<br />Overall this album has 3 bad songs \\"Early mornin', Everytime and Brave new girl\\".<BR>2 ok songs \\"Shadow\\" (Thanks to the verses and music, not the chorus) and \\"Me against the music (Original version)\\".<br />and 10 brilliant RnB/hip-hop/dance-fusion tracks.<br />This album is very maturely written and the music is alot more for the older audience.  People who liked \\"Baby and Oops\\" will not like it as it's an absolute 180 degrees to those albums.  If you didn't like the change the 1st 2 to \\"Britney\\" then you won't like this either.<br />All I can say is be ready to b shocked and non-fan get ready 2 b impressed!<br />Jahangeer.
B00000J7JO|5.0|just a few words.<br />this is a perfect album - no weak tracks,great production,Red hot's proved that they are still the best.i bought it after i heard &quot;Scar tissue&quot; and before all the hit singles started coming from it into radio and tv.the music still a bit funky but lyrics and sound changed a lot - red hot's grown up a lot.<br />this album changed my life,i was in really bad condition and with this album i made couple decisions that influended my later life - this album is important to me because of it<br />anyway,thaks Anthony,John,Chad and Flea for making such a timeless music.this is my all time favourite album and there is almost nothing so perfect like &quot;Californication&quot;<BR>simply call it a Masterpiece
B000050HTO|3.0|I have no problem with Greatest Hits or Essential CDs.  I know from personal experience that no one can realistically buy AND listen to every album from every conceivable artist in whom they've ever had an interest.  Ideally, listening to a selection of songs will motivate someone to go out and buy a larger selection of that artist's albums if the music on the hits CD inspires them.  I also realize that no collection can be comprehensive enough to please everyone or to include every important song.  So I'm not going to complain about taking Dylan's songs out of context of their admitedly important original albums.  The songs here are indeed masterpieices.  While Dylan's voice is not for all tastes, his songwriting is without competition, and there is no disputing that some of these songs are among the greatest American music ever created.  <br />That being said, the wasted space on these discs is inexcusable.  I don't believe in cramming every single empty second on a CD with filler material.  Some of the greatest albums ever recorded clock in under 30 minutes.  But on a greatest hits collection, there's no reason not to fill the discs when the artist in question has 40 years of material from which to choose.  I'm not an expert on Dylan so I can't cite every missing masterpiece, but clearly &quot;I Want You&quot; should be on here, as well as some lesser known stuff from his Bootleg Series like &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;.  A European version of this collection does in fact have more songs, so it's not as if it wasn't considered.  There's simply no excuse for the wasted space, and it seriously detracts from the value of this collection, in my opinion.  The lack of lyrics or song details in the liner notes is also a major negative.  Some of the Sony Essential Series are great collections- The Clash, Springsteen, Willie Nelson.  While the music and the sonic clarity can't be disputed, this is defnitely a lesser entry in the series.
B000001YOW|4.0|&quot;Signify&quot; album is Porcupine tree's one of the most popular works.highly rated by critics and fans it remains one of their most interesting works (although still their best albums are &quot;Stupid dream&quot; and &quot;In absentia&quot; in my opinion).<BR>Steven Wilson abandoned the Long art-rock teritory after bombastic &quot;Sky moves sideway&quot; which was the good album but many people started to compared his band to modern era Pink Floyd.<BR>that's why Steven formed a real band and recorded something that cannot be really putted on one shelf. &quot;Signify&quot; represents the real Porcupine tree style.<br />Heavy instrumental title track is featuring more straight-forward rhythm section and guitars.it signals the riff experiments on later works.it also signals bigger simplicity.<BR>&quot;Signify&quot; contains a few great songs beside instrumental track.<BR>the famous song from here is &quot;Waiting&quot; (part 1) - their popular single hit with etheral vocals and atractive melody.&quot;Sleep of no dreaming&quot; and &quot;Sever&quot; are containing very dark sound but they are catchy too.my favourite is &quot;Every home is wired&quot; - psychedelic beatles meet David gilmour here - great acoustic riff and wierd drum outro...&quot;Dark matter&quot; is a good song too,many fans claim that it is one of their best songs ever.<br />&quot;Signify&quot; is a very good Porcupine tree album and it holds many strong points.although a bit flat production and some pretentious moments on instrumental tracks are making it a bit weakere to be a 5 stars work it still remains huge piece of amazing music.Steven Wilson can't be wrong - this is art!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|At the peak of their popularity, Pearl Jam was the biggest rock band in the world.  Obviously, Ten helped out a lot in that respect.  However, it was not until seeing their live performance at the 1993 MTV Music Awards with Neil Young that I became a true fan of the band.  That was the first time I witnessed the legendary intensity of the band and it's lead singer.  That was the most amazing performance of &quot;Rockin' In the Free World&quot; I have ever seen.  Eddie even had the now famous bottle of wine with him up on stage!  A decade later, I am an even greater fan of the band.  The reason is very simply because the band mixes great music with great lyrics.  In my opinion, good music evokes emotional responses such as anger, sadness, longing, regret, hope, etc.  Couple that with lyrics that speak the music's message and you have a great song.  It is true that Eddie Vedder does not have the greatest voice in the world, but that doesn't matter because it is effective.  It conveys his emotions well enough.  It can be downright grungy, rough &amp; dirty to hauntingly beautiful.  I think Pearl Jam has long surpassed Nirvana as the better band.  Simply because Nirvana is no longer around to prove their all around musical genius.  Pearl Jam has evolved to a more grass roots, somewhat punk (actually, more in spirit than musically speaking) rock band with a sensitive side that does not have boundaries and could care less about musical trends or incredible commercial success.<br />As stated before in previous reviews, Lost Dogs is pretty damn good for being only a collection of b-sides and/or rarities.  I am also surprised (along with many of you), that some of these were never released.  My personal favorite is &quot;Sad&quot;.  This is an incredibly beautiful song.  &quot;Down&quot; is pretty good also.  Also, check out &quot;Don't Gimme No Lip&quot;.  I've been singing this song to my wife ever since I bought the CD!  Lost Dogs is a definite must-buy for any Pearl Jam.

He has a good job, a beautiful but self-centered fianc&eacute; named Jessica, and a comfortable future awaiting him.<br />Until he finds a young girl practically unconscious on the sidewalk as he Jessica are walking towards a pivotal dinner meeting for her career.

Neil Gaiman has brought to life a fantastic world that is definitely worth your time to explore along with Richard and Door.<br />Door wishes to find her family's killers, Richard wants to go back to London Above, and Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar are closing in on both of them, hired assassins with an unclear mission and mysterious employer.<br />The story moves with a rapid pace through peril after peril through bizarre markets and deadly bridges and odd links between London Above and London Below, a very interesting and compelling read with a highly fueled imaginative setting and fully fleshed out characters.  Enjoy!
B00004XOWM|3.0|I was excited when i bought this cd, but i listened to it a few times, i do feel that some of the songs get old quickly. There's way too much rapping in this record, although there are a few good songs on it such as &quot;My Way&quot; &quot;Rollin'(Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot;. Limp didn't really do well on this album, but they tried, just not there yet. A few songs on this record are boring, the effects aren't that good or badly used. Still, their hard work on this album is much appreciated.<br />I'm not saying that this album is bad, it's just that it won't grab your attention the way other bands do. Don't expect too much from this record, try out &quot;Significant Other&quot;, one of the older stuff from Limp, you would find it more satisfying than this.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Take a 5 star, timeless piece of music from the 70's and digitally remaster the sound and what do you get?  5 stars of course.<br />One of my all time absolute favorite mood albums of all, the remastered version is worth the purchase even if you own the un-doctored CD.  The stereo effects are fleshed and separated out, leaving this perfect for your surround sound system or a high end set of headphones.<br />One of my favorite all time pieces, Time, is amazingly clear on the headphones, along with the background voices, heartbeats, and subtle nuances of softly changing beats and haunting guitar and keyboard.  If you are young and don't remember this album or don't know the lyrics, it's worth the bother to hunt them up online, or better yet just listen to it until you memorize it like all of us 70's children did.<br />This entire album is about death, and I have often said that it is what should be played at my funeral.  Mood music to have a funeral by, but get the remastered version so the guests will enjoy it more.
B00006690G|1.0|Eminem is a wasted unit.  People got way to hyped up over him for nothing.  Vanilla Ice is cooler to me, which is bad.  Dont buy his albums, its just a waste of your  time.  Get something good, like red hot chili peppers, or incubus.
B00005JLK1|5.0|Wow!  If you love a great splatter scene, you will be hooked on this movie within the first five minutes.  Remember when the lawyer split in Thirteen Ghosts?  Within 5 minutes of Ghost ship a cable on a luxury cruise ship snaps and slices an entire deck full of people in half.  Awesome special effects here!<br />The main premise of the movie follows a salvage crew hired by a man who claims to have found a large derelict vessel, offering them a large percentage to help him haul it in.  They find the ship, and more than they bargained for.  There is millions of dollars of gold on the Antonia Graza, but also a bevy of guests who have never left.<br />Epps, played by Julia Margulies, believes that she has seen a young girl aboard the derelict ship who tries to warn her away.  But before anyone will listen to her, greed and accidents take over and the crew becomes trapped aboard the Antonia Graza and, of course, people start dying.<br />Truly a visual stunner, don't miss the flashback scene perfectly choreographed to an almost sexy melody using slow motion and step-speed filming to perfection, and when the movie is finished, check out the video 'Not Falling' by Mudvayne.  Also noteworthy is the special effects feature on the DVD, detailing how the FX team made such a magnificent splash (pun intended) with the opening gore scene.  Watch out for the pork and beans!<br />If you are a lover of horror and splatter, do not miss out on this treat. It sure hooked that sexy Italian singer.  Enjoy!
B000000WJZ|5.0|Alright: I've heard this album from beginning to end countless times like the reviewers below, and I feel that the innumerable praises have been righteously given to this album.<br />Simply put, this is the greatest album the Pumpkins ever put out.  MCIS is a close second best, but Siamses Dream is so close to perfection that it can't be outranked even by the best-selling double album of all time.   Personally, I'd have to say that this album is even better than Nevermind..  Yes, Nevermind was more groundbreaking at the time of its release, but Corgan and the band's masterful work done on this album outshines the late Cobain.  Honestly, based on guitar skills, Cobain can't touch Corgan. <br />Simply put, this album is my favorite rock album of all-time.  Hell, I've even played 'Mayonaise' in my high-school talent show back when I was a senior; it was just like the acoustic version from Vieuphoria.  If you like rock, and you have liked any singles by the great SP, then you must check this album out.   Guitar players and drum players must hear this album too... great stuff from a great band.
6305090564|5.0|Boy, I do love the combination of ships and blood-fests.  I thoroughly enjoyed both Virus and Ghost Ship, and now another favorite arises from the depths.<br />Despite no big name stars, get ready for some truly great performances from the cast; Treat Williams as Captain Finnegan, Kevin O'Conner (The Mummy) as Pantucci, Una Damon as Leila, and Jason Flemyng as Mulligan, just to name a few.<br />A group of would be robbers armed with torpedoes set out to terrorize and rob a luxury cruise ship, hiring  Captain Finnigan and his ship and crew, who hire out to anyone with the cash, no questions asked.  The cruise ship is sabotaged by an insider on board, but before the pack of robbers can make it onboard, something else takes control of the ship:  the big squid thing.<br />Already on board is Trillian, played by Famke Janssen, a fairly incompetent female thief who manages to get herself locked in the vault before being able to steal a necklace she was after.<br />With Finnegan's ship disabled from running into a stray lifeboat, they all board the cruise liner, meet up with Trillian, and one by one fall victim Mr. Squid.  Very action packed, rapidly moving, gorily fascinating splatter fest that is a five star must see.  Especially when Mr. Squid vomits out the half digested guy who is still alive, one of my all time favorite horror movie scenes.<br />There are crunching skulls, folding metal, bursting pipes, rapid gunfire, and some pretty funny dialogue that manages to not sound out of place like so many flat one liners in horror films.  All of the messy, gory, bloody lower levels of the ship, bending and peeling metal, various and sundry body parts, combine to announce the arrival of the squid-like monster with immense strength and an appetite to match.  All in all, a wonderful journey with a surprise, funny ending.  Enjoy!
B00009TB5G|5.0|Needless to say, the extended version of Lord of the Rings &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is breathtaking and the new scenes really add and explain a lot and make the story richer. I have read the books, and I am not a purist, but even I was saddened at the change in Faramir. I thought it ruined the character, however in the extended version, you can see they did not at all. He rather had a &quot;journey&quot;, and though many will say you should tamper with books, some things just don't work the same in movies the same way  they do in books, and Peter Jackson and the writers knew this. It is explained in some interesting extras as well on adapting Lord of The Rings to the Screen.<br />  I would say that if you are a fan of the books and you hated the theatrical version of the movies, get &quot;The Two Towers&quot; extended edition, it has 43mins extra footage(all great and useful footage), and a lot of good audio commentary and extras that explain a lot about the changes from book to film and the making of the film and Tolkiens own vision and such. Its really a whole new experience.!<br />  God Bless ~Amy
B00006JDS4|4.0|Jennifer is a writer who heads out to a country cabin to spend time writing her novel.  What she didn't count on was the small town local yokels, a group of savage .... rednecks who see her as an easy target.<br />Which she is.  They all set upon her and rape her one by one, in a fairly drawn out part of the movie.  She is raped, then let go, then caught and raped again, then let go, then caught and raped again, and so forth.  Finally, the \\"boys\\" convince the dim-witted grocery deliver boy to go back in and kill her, which he finds he cannot do, so he fakes it.<br />So what's a girl to do?  Instead of reporting the crimes, Jennifer decides to get even.  One by one, she picks her assailants off.  The bathtub scene is not to be missed, and what separates this from the rest of the cheesily made 70's splatter films is her languid calmness as she sets about her business.<br />The down side of this is that the DVD version promises digital remastering.  That's fine, but don't count on good sound quality, if they remastered the video they seemed to have forgotten about the audio.  The sound is as bad as it was in the original.<br />What made this movie so scandelous back in the 70's was the nudity and what was, back then, a fairly realistic and brutally intact rape scene.  Watching it again now, it is as cheesy as the rest of the movie, and yet still holds it's entertainment value against the newer and better made films.<br />If you are a fan of cheesy older splatter films, you will love this movie.  If you are not, you might want to pick up something else.  All in all, I give it four stars.  Enjoy.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Here we are in the age of technology; we're smart, we're advanced, and we get machines to do everything for us. The George Foreman grill is a machine that grills our hamburgers for us, and Guy Pearce is a machine that does our acting for us.<br />Not to worry, though. Not everything is done by machines. The special effects and monsters in The Time Machine, for example, were clearly done by two years olds.<br />Here in this brilliant age of brilliant minds, we find yet another version of the standard sci-fi movie shown in films like Planet of the Apes (the old version) and Planet of the Apes (the new version). A smart scientist guy goes to the future, hooks up with a girl who doesn't talk very often (if at all), and arrogantly declares that things can change before saving the girl and her species from some sort of monster species of primate.<br />Stick with fantasy. Although sci-fi has dropped to an all-time low in intelligence -- SIGNS!!! Not to mention any names -- fantasy has peaked with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|If you're reading this review because you can't decide whether to buy this DVD, delay no longer; buy it now!<br />Viewing the Concert For George is a marvelous experience. Being present during the performance would have been the only way to top the DVD, but since I wasn't, I'm grateful this superb set exists. Disc Two is great; I loved all its contents, including the interviews with some of the musicians and the Pythons, the look into Ravi Shankar's mastery with his orchestra, and the theatrical version of the Concert. But experiencing the magical ambiance of the entire concert version, contained on Disc One, is beyond words.<br />Describing each of the concert's numbers would take too much space here, but highlights certainly include Jeff Lynne and Anoushka Shankar's lovely version of &quot;The Inner Light&quot;; Joe Brown's perfect &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;; Eric Clapton's intense solo on &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;; Ringo Star's &quot;Photograph&quot;; and the entire band's work on &quot;Something.&quot; Watching Dhani Harrison play along with the big names on stage thrilled me. Sometimes I had to remember that he wasn't George! Seeing the crowd stand, dance, and clap to &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and, later, hearing the bittersweet &quot;I'll See You in My Dreams&quot; at the end were marvelous moments as well. Every performance in the Concert for George shines as both a friendly, respectful tribute to George as a person, as well as a superb version of his music. I would think one performance was my favorite until the next came along and charmed me all over again.<br />No problem exists with either the audio or video production of this DVD. Watching and listening are made pleasurable for the viewer. You'll find yourself crying, laughing, dancing, singing, and just blissfully sitting back, watching in awe and gratitude as the magical musical maestros salute our dear, sweet George.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|Outstanding action sequences permeate this movie. The acting is great. This is truer to the nature of it's comic book source material than any other film, especially in the crucial area of the depiction of action. Much improved over the first movie, which was very good too.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|A truly enjoyable CD that challenges the listener on many levels.  So wonderful to hear his brilliant use of real instruments and fascinating lyrics.  All in all, his best work to date by far.  It's fantastic to watch an artist/songwriter grow and come into their own.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|My first exposure to this album, as I'm sure it was for many, was its use in the I-Pod commercial. When I witnessed that commercial, I felt great that such a great song was getting such good airplay but I also felt bad that I would never figure out who this band was. That is, until they were raved about in a recent Newsweek. I decided I had to get their album and I did.<br />This album, to be honest, confuses me. Not the music itself, really, but rather where this band go. I cannot see where this band will go in the future. Most likely right back down the path they just went down, but my guess is this upcoming record could never be as fun or cohesive as this album. I seriously doubt their potential longevity, but for right now, let's just not think about that and focus on now.<br />As a whole, this album is just a pure jolt of fun and energy that Jet does really well with its derivative hooks and charms. They sound similar to fellow Aussies, The Vines, with influences more along the lines of The Who as opposed to The Beatles and Nirvana. This influence, to me at least, seems no more apparent than on the opening track, 'Last Chance,' a two-minute romp of energy. The standout song on the album is still the I-Pod theme, 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl,' simply for its pure hook and drive. In fact, the primary force of this album is when it relies on these catchy, hyperactive songs as opposed to slower songs.<br />True, 'Move On' and 'Timothy' paint a truly affecting picture and 'Radio Song' and 'Lazy Gun' (if you consider them slower songs) are great experimental songs for Jet, the band and its music truly comes out with their harder, faster songs. The two low points in the album are the poppy piano ballad 'Look What You've Done' and the overlong 'Come Around Again.' These two songs, as well as this band's uncertain future, are the two things that holds Jet back. Plus, I feel like my doubt about their future projects stems from these two songs. They seem a strange contrast to the real driven songs that comprise the rest of Get Born and leave the record with a strange uncleanliness. Which direction will the band veer, the way of the garage or the way of the ballad? Considering most of the album is garage rock, they'll most likely go that way, but don't count out the other direction.<br />If this band had left out two tracks, Get Born would have been that much better for it. Further proof to the fact that seemingly small things can change the perspective of the whole package.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|We grew up with the Beatles and this is the Best Collection because they are ALL well known hits. They had many records  and Chart Busters, lately there has been an Attempt that I do not always like to dig up Un-Published material. I Have the Number  1 on Cassete and it is high quality stereo that runs fine  on my Walkman. Being a Cassete it has two sides in chronological  order, so depending what I feel like listening to I sometimes  listen to side two.  \\"Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play\\"  ...Yesterday, It was so wonderful to play the Beatles...  I had the Cassete in 2003  I now have CD 2008.
630463949X|1.0|As someone who enjoyed Fleetwood Mac I decided after reading the reviews here to buy the DVD. What a waste of money! A lifeless performance with some very poor vocals in places - especially Lindsey. Some excellent guitar work doesn't make up for a lack of passion in the performance. In places its embarassing. Sorry, this is a waste of money in my opinion, there are some much better concerts to spend money on.
B000002LGQ|5.0|Prior to the release of this album, Madonna was an unadulterated pop star.  Even with such mature hits as \\"Live to Tell\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita\\" under her belt, Madonna was very much the Material Girl.  But that was soon to change.  After pressing play on the 1989 Like a Prayer, fans were presented with a rock guitar scratching out an intro to one of Madonna's most transformative singles ever.  An artist that is known for changing up her style, Madonna used \\"Like a Prayer\\" to single-handedly propel herself from a bubblegum pop princess to a legitimate rock goddess.  The rest of the album followed suit and introduced the world to a new, grown-up musician.  The sound was strong, loud, daring, and unlike anything she had recorded before.  It was a solid outing that most likely solidified Madonna's fate as one of the most successful female artists of all time.  There are moments on the album where it seems Madonna was too daring, and pushed the musical envelope to the point of breaking (\\"Love Song,\\" \\"Dear Jesse,\\" \\"Act of Contrition\\"), but even these few oddities can not overshadow the strength of such personal and emotional powerhouses as \\"Promise to Try\\" and \\"Oh Father.\\"  Our little girl had grown up and turned in the pop material of her past for introspective, powerful, emotional music.  Our prayers had been answered.
6305718954|5.0|BREATHTAKING comes to mind when I think of this non stop thrill ride of biblical proportions! Not since Gone with the Wind have I seen better character development and a sly wit that can only be compared to the late Hugh Grant in &quot;4 Weddings and a Funeral&quot;<br />I was giggling in my seat the whole way through, as this cinematic masterpiece took me, shook me and hooked me all the way to the finish line!
B00004X01U|5.0|The second half of Madonna's career has been marked with new sounds, new ideas, and new directions.  She went from sex kitten to Hindu goddess, Argentinean leader to militant.  She dabbled in R&B, techno, and even a little country.  She was afraid of nothing and took risks that other artists would run screaming from.  And while she saw continued success, she never came close to the pandemonium she induced in the 1980's.  She had peaked, and all that was to come after was bound to sit in the shadow of that early stardom.  In 2000, coming off the relatively massive success of Ray of Light, Madonna released an album that began with a mechanical voice entreating the DJ to put a record on.  From those first robotic words, Music blared forward, taking the best of modern techno music and somehow using it to remind us of the past which Madonna can never deny.  The dance floor was once again a place for freedom.  Love was as fun as it was painful.  Madonna wanted us to let go and have a good time.  The heaviness of Ray of Light was shelved for the moment.  The controversy of Erotica was temporarily forgotten.  The seriousness of Evita was a thing of the past.  It was time to look back a little further and remember the roots of the world's most recognizable pop icon.  Madonna emerged from the club culture of New York and her first hits propelled her even deeper into that eternal weekend night.  \\"Everybody,\\" \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Dress You Up\\" - all were fun and freeing anthems that begged their listeners to \\"dance and sing, get up and do your thing.\\"  The trend continued with \\"Material Girl,\\" \\"Open Your Heart,\\" \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Cherish.\\"  All of that fun-loving pop sensibility came back for one more spin with Music.  Many feel that Madonna came into her own as a musician and a woman with Ray of Light, but taking it one step further, Music is the album in which she reconciles all she has learned with her past and comes to a happy conclusion.  This album is Madonna's nod to her beginnings.  It does not forsake all she has learned and all the growing she has done.  It merely melds the two, peppering her new mature sound and ideals with ideas and feelings from the past.  Music makes it fun to be a Madonna fan again.  It is all you could want from the woman who you had grown up with.  It is new and fresh, but it sill sounded familiar.  It is a departure that is still close enough to have a clear glimpse of home.  And all the while it winks at its audience, guides it to the dance floor, whispers in its ear, and twirls it aimlessly through a tribute to the indisputable Queen of Pop.

B000002NJS|4.0|Billed by many as Madonna's comeback album, Ray of Light is the project that brought her out of the shadow of Erotica and Bedtime Stories and brought her into the light of critical acclaim and musical success, as well as personal and spiritual awareness.  Madonna embraced a techno god as producer and dove into an introspective landscape of cool orchestrations and hot bleeps and beats.  The result was a new sound and new persona for pop music's favorite chameleon.  It was an incarnation that paid off well for the new mom.  This \\"Gospel According to Madonna\\" did much to resuscitate the ailing Madge, even earning her a few Grammy Awards.  However, as a whole, the album is a heavy and often burdensome listen, far from the light and playful Madonna albums that brought her to this point.  The lead single, \\"Frozen,\\" weighs in at a hefty 6 minutes and 12 seconds and is a perfect representation of this album.  It's an undeniably beautiful song that is just a little too long and a little too laden down with message.  And often times it feels as though the message is forced, as if Madonna is trying too hard to get us to buy the fact that she really is spiritual guru (\\"Shanti/Ashtangi?\\") - honest to Allah.  Many of the songs on here are simply gorgeous and can never be overlooked, but as a whole the album feels like a marathon for the spiritually motivated (I can count the amount of times I've made it all the way through to \\"Mer Girl\\" on one hand).  Madonna often has something to say with her music, but with this album the message takes precedence over the music.  And at the end of the day, it is the music that Madonna is known for.
B000002B2T|5.0|You can read all the other reviews and have people tell you how good this CD is. But one song i've barely seen mentioned is &quot;November Hotel&quot;. This instrumental is filled with energy and emotion. The 7-minute masterpiece starts soft, with the whispering noise of a guitar. By the time 4 minutes of the song has passed, the guitar has transformed into a powerful, distorted roar. Although it may lack the powerful voice of Layne Staley, the wailing voice of Mike McCready's guitar makes up for it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|With a lead single (in which Madonna takes an ill-fated stab at rapping) that tanked in the US, a video that was pulled before its release, and a string of confusing and jumbled marketing techniques, American Life will most likely go down in history as the least successful Madonna album ever.  Though it peaked at number one in the US in its first week of release, it quickly tumbled into oblivion.  This is the unfortunate tale of Madonna's most personal album to date.  Excluding the annoying \\"American Life\\" and the rather lackluster \\"Hollywood,\\" (both of which were released as singles and may have helped seal the fate of this album), American Life is a beautiful and musically diverse collection of songs that speaks to the heart of the woman that is Madonna.  Most notable are the three songs anchoring the album - \\"Nothing Fails,\\" \\"Intervention,\\" and \\"X-Static Process.\\"  As with Ray of Light, Madonna has a message to send her listeners about celebrity, love, and self-awareness.  However, unlike Ray of Light, the message here rings true.  Perhaps it is the earnestness in her voice as she prays that her lover will \\"always be there.\\"  Or maybe it is the fact that often Madonna is left with nothing but her voice and a guitar to get her point across. Whatever the reason, the message that seemed to get in the way of tracks like \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Swim,\\" and \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" takes flight on this album.  There is a truth in her words that was not apparent before.  With American Life we may not get the Madonna we are used to, but for once it would seem we get the real deal.
0142437611|4.0|Poor Tommy Wihelm!  This is a sad spectacle of a novella.  Sad, in that you can't help but feel for this poor guy.  Tommy Wilhelm has squandered his life.  He chased his dreams to Hollywood.... and failed.  He got into business...  and failed.  He got married and had to boys...  and failed.  He tried to become a commodities trader... and failed.<br />I can't help but think of Biff Loman, when I read this one.  Tommy Wilhelm's life is a story of bad choices and missed opportunities.  We all have experienced moments like this, but Wilhelm's whole life is based on this premise.<br />As the story comes to a conclusion.  Tommy Wilhelm's life begins to crash down bit by bit until it looks totally hopeless.  And really,  it is totally hopeless.<br />Tommy's plunge into a torrent of tears is a fitting end to this sad, sad story.<br />Bellow's writing is lean and direct.  This book is a great case- study of futile, life planning.  It is well written and worth your attention.
B00005Q66T|3.0|With the possible exceptions of \\"Don't Cry For Me Argentina\\" and \\"Human Nature,\\" all of the singles on here are deserving of their spot on an album that is designed as a tribute to the second decade of an extraordinary career.  Sadly, there seems to be little cohesion to this album.  Perhaps it's a tribute to the diversity of Madonna's later works that this album does not work as a whole.  Whatever the reason may be, this album comes across as a mix tape straight to you from one of the world's most recognizable pop icons.  Thrown together with lots of hits, but little thought, it's fun but sloppy.  Even the editing of the songs leaves you yearning for the original versions.  And yet, no one can discount the power and importance of each individual song.  It may not be as classically iconic as its predecessor (The Immaculate Collection), but like all poorly done mix tapes from old friends, it's special in its own charming way.
B0000CABJ1|2.0|...but what you get is the same old journey with a couple of new bonus tracks that doesn't even include the radio version of her current hit You're So Beautiful. Instead they give us an 11 minute version of the song on a bonus disc. What is the point of this collection except for the inclusion of some of her later minor hits like I Will Go On. I want to do a compilation that would include Melody Of Love  and Power Of One, Carry On, Love Is A Healer and how about the 12&quot; mix of All Systems Go and I Don't Wanna Get Hurt.<br /><br />  That would make me want to purchase a 2 CD retrospect. Tired of the SOStuff. Also could have made it more interesting if they used the rare original single versions of Love To Love You Baby and Could It Be Magic.<br /><br />  Guess she just doesn't want to work hard for the money anymore...lol
B000002N3J|4.0|Madonna is best known for her catchy dance tunes, but to dismiss her ballads is to dismiss a great portion of her career.  \\"Live to Tell,\\" \\"You'll See,\\" \\"Take a Bow,\\" and \\"This Used to Be My Playground\\" are only a few examples of songs that showcase Madonna at her most powerful and most vulnerable (a juxtaposition that no one plays as well as Madonna).  As an album (and unlike other Madonna compilations such as GHV2) this project works beautifully.  The songs are pulled from all across Madonna's sprawling career, and yet the end result is a touching and unobtrusive reminder of the power of Madonna's softer side.  This one really is something worth remembering.
B0000029DD|5.0|normally i would hesitate to use words like &quot;masterpiece&quot; or &quot;genius&quot; when reviewing anything, for fear of building it up too much and leaving the listener disappointed. but i have no such fear with grace. it is simply one of the greatest albums ever made. it needs to be experienced, not just listened to, from start to finish. it's interesting to listen to the rougher jeff on live at sine, or sketches, and then hear the luminous, polished beauty of grace. it makes you appreciate how truly gifted he was - his ability to craft a song, to mold it and play with it, is evidenced in sine and sketches. grace shows the brilliance of his finished product. if you love music, you will love this album.
B0000T6JH4|3.0|This CD is ok.  There isn't really anything new here.  Tracks like Get Back, Let it Be, Don't Let Me Down, and Across the Universe are already available in &quot;De-Spectorized&quot; versions on the Past Masters Vol 2 CD.  Actually the Past Master versions of these songs sound better then on LIBN.  On Let It Be Naked the guitars are not that prominent in the mix on all the songs except I Me Mine (which actually sounds better to me).  Don't Let Me Down and I've Got a Feeling really suffer from the buried guitars in the mix.  As for songs like the Long and Winding Road and Let It Be they benefited from Phil Spector.  The LAWR needs the orchestra not the &quot;toy piano&quot; that is present in this mix.  And by the way this track was also available on the Anthology 3 CD.  As for the title track I actually prefer the Spector version because the George Harrison guitar solo is much clearer.  The version on this CD is ok, but nothing special when compared to the album version released in 1970 or the single version released in 1969. As for the omission of Maggie Mae and Dig it, they might as well have left them on the CD there was certainly enough space. Also they should have left the dialogue in, there is some classic stuff there.  In addition with so much more space on the CD its a wonder why they didn't put Beatle versions of songs like All Things Must Pass among others, which were recovered last year by police from bootleggers.  As for the bonus disc, its just parts of songs and dialogue, if you like that sort of stuff.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Best ever. Hands down. Be sure and combine the first two soundtracks as well. This is just unbelievable.<br />So glad that Shore saved some of the best for last.
B00005JLU1|5.0|This movie is wonderful, if you like Johnny Depp, John Waters, or just plain good movies.  The sound track is good too, in fact, most people are fooled into thinking that Johnny is the one doing the singing, but alas, he is not.  But the voice is so close to his that you truly believe it is him.  And with a supporting cast that includes Ricki Lake, Iggy Pop and Traci Lords, you cannot go wrong!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Unbelievable.  How in the world could any competent producer cut the wonderful distorted guitar solo and fills in the Spector produced original version of the song &quot;Let It Be&quot; and replace it with the chicken picking version on this album?  It sounds like George Harrison's take was removed and McCartney was substituted practicing his pentatonic scales.<br />People interested in the Beatles should just buy the original albums, plus Past Masters.  This reconstituted effort after two of the Beatles are now gone is simply re-writing history. 2-stars.
0385504209|4.0|If you are one of the few people who have not read the book yet - do not hesitate and do it now.  Odds are very favorable that you will like it, even be thrilled by it.  It is highly entertaining, fast-paced, exiting and informative.  The author has the endearing habit of sharing with the readers tidbits of extraneous information - not trivia - he has found in the course of his research.<br />However, do not expect perfection or a future classic work of literature.  There are shortcomings. But before I list them, let's deal with some issues which should not worry you:<br />1. The book is \\"an attack on Catholic Church and Christianity.\\" The book is no such thing, unless you believe that the Church can never do anything wrong (remember Inquisition?), can never be criticized, and that we already know everything that can be known.<br />2. The book is based on \\"completely unfound legend,\\" \\"crackpot theory.\\"  \\"Anyone who knows art history and Christian history will see this book for what it is - pure garbage.\\"  Again, it is neither of those things.  While the protagonists, understandably, present an alternative history in more assured terms than someone \\"objective\\" might do, there is more than enough evidence suggesting the possibility of their main contention being true, and there are serious scholars who accept the described interpretation of evidence.<br />3. Minor errors or dubious details that some flaunt as earth shattering evidence of wrongness of the whole book.  Examples: Monks and habits not existing in Opus Dei. BIG DEAL!  Anyway, even if just about nobody there was a monk and wear a habit, could there not be one exception?  \\"Cargo truck hummed, then the truck roared, then there was hum again.\\" BIG DEAL!  Moreover, humming refers to tire noise, while roaring to the engine noise, which can change with time.  \\"Da Vinci is not Leonardo's name.\\" BIG DEAL!  Thousands know and call Leonardo \\"Da Vinci,\\" and even though it is imprecise, using just Leonardo would be equally ambiguous (how many Leonardos have there been in the world), and using always the full name would be cumbersome.<br />4. Perhaps the most silly objection is that &quot;though some may find the religious topic thought provoking, this book doesn't require deep thinking\\".  How many mystery novels are thought provoking, not to mention requiring deep thinking?  The fact that so many people, as shown by the positive reviews, have found the book thought provoking, is an unquestionable testimony and tribute.<br />Disregarding the above, what are the real shortcomings of Da Vinci Code?  Here is my list:<br />A. As mentioned by many reviewers, the characters are poorly developed.  Not unusual for a mystery/action story, but regretful anyway.<br />B. The ending is, in my view, a mistake.  The author should have left an open ending, rather than provide a specific, highly unlikely explicit solution to a fictional story.<br />C. Perhaps most importantly, it might dawn on you in about the middle of the book, if not sooner, that the plot is a logical absurdity.  Here we have a dying man, frantic to save an enormously important secret, of which he is the only keeper, from being lost forever, and to transfer it to one specific person.  Does he do it using one encrypted, safe message?  No, he sends the person(s) on a chase, at each stage of which the secret could be eternally lost!  And he has prepared this process in advance, while presumably sane!  Essential for the story, but logically unacceptable.<br />D. The essential premise of the story is that the \\"secret,\\" which is the main topic, is so earth shattering, that revealing it would imperil the Catholic Church.  In reality, as shown most clearly in the ABC Special, very respectable Church notables look at the suggestion regarding Mary Magdalene with complete benevolence.  The author has interestingly, and perhaps wisely, steered away from the more radical version of the legend, but doing so he again created a logical void.ambiguous (how many Leonardos have there been in the world), and using always the full name would be cumbersome.<BR>4.

B0000DJZA5|2.0|I love the Beatles and have been listening to them for over 25 years.  I loved it when finally(!) \\"new\\" material was released with the BBC and Anthology albums.  I rushed out to get them right away.  I even thought the Yellow Submarine remix was a good idea and great sound improvement. But this release . . .  there's just something about it that leaves me cold.  This IS NOT \\"Let it Be\\" the way the Beatles wanted it.  The fact is, they never recorded it the way they wanted in the first place.  (The original concept was for the album to be recorded live in concert).  Basically, they never got beyond demos and rehearsals and the original LIB was salvaged from that - and that's all LIBN is as well.  Secondly, and my biggest complaint, is that this IS NOT the first time that the songs have been released without the Spector production.  There really is nothing new here.  However, it is being marketed as if it is. Thirdly, material has been removed, in particular, John Lennon material.  Even though Maggie Mae, Dig It and the various bits of spoken commentary are just snippets of foolishness, I always loved them as what they were - Lennon cheekiness that added fun and character to the album.  If anything, longer versions of MM and DI (which exist on bootleg) should have been included.  Lastly, I find it both sad and laughable that this is being put across as having the stamp of approval of all four Beatles.  Let's face it, poor John and George are not here.  Everyone knows darn well John would not have been in favor of this. And George, dying of cancer for the last several years, probably had other things on his mind and likely would have gone along with anything.  Some people have tried to say Paul had nothing to do with this.  If you believe that, I have a nice bridge to sell you. This is a McCartney vanity project, pure and simple.  Aside from that, the title and cover art are shockingly bad.  All together - the packaging, the title, the marketing, the revisionism - is all way beneath the standards I have come to expect from product associated with the Beatles.  I just don't like being sold a bill of goods and, unlike BBC, the Anthologies and the YS reissue, that's just what this feels like.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|I hated this movie and had a great time doing it. As relentlessly grim as it is artless, Scarface's bombastic score makes it painful to listen to as well. Clearly at no point did anyone say, &quot;This is a steaming pile of dung, why don't we fix it?&quot; The dialogue is dank, the plot predictable. One hopes that Al Pacino came down with Indigestion after all the scenery he chewed in this forgettable flick. Clearly a frontrunner for the 20th century's worst film, right behind &quot;The Postman&quot; and one slot ahead of &quot;Howard The Duck&quot;. Honestly, I've seen better film on teeth.
B000002KGT|5.0|Hands down the most influential band of the 70's released a masterpiece. Every song is its own story and each mood of the years of the 1970's. If you like Classic Rock or all the music they played in the film  &quot;Almost Famous&quot; you will looove this CD!!<br />To this day, I am still listening to this cd, more than 25 yrs after it was released..
B00005JLYW|1.0|This Planet of the Apes remake is just plain silly. There was no need to remake the beloved Charlton Heston classic; Michael Clark Duncan is a capable ape but the rest of the leads are wooden and seem comfortable playing monkeys. Tim Burton really messed up making this one. Now, I know this is supposed to be a review of Charlie's Angels Full Throttle but I got lazy damnit so this is a review of Planet of the Apes instead. Now, I have yet to see Full Throttle but I don't really like Cameron Diaz Bernie Mac or females in action pictures in general, So I give it one star. That out of the way, instead of wasting your money on Planet of the Apes rent the sci-fi masterpiece Tron instead; its like being born again.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Heck I would like to say that this Album is just Hip to the bomb I mean (I Got That) Boom Boom Ft Ying Yang Twins is a tight song has the good beat and the singing and everything just sounds real cool. The whole album aint all about love which I like 'cause I'm not into all that love song type of stuff. And I'm a big fan of Rap, R&amp;b and stuff like that but when I heard this cd just hit the spot with the beats my ears were hooked till the whole cd was through with...Specially with the Madonna feature on there also a good remix at the end so check it out if you love the hip hop beats cause for sure you'll get what you bought, and not another one to waste money on.
B00003CXD5|1.0|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is like taking a bus trip with someone who has needed a bath for a long time. It's not merely bad; it's unpleasant in a hostile way. The dialogue is inane, the acting wooden. This is just a lumbering, poorly photographed piece of derivative drivel, full of grunting extras scampering around in animal pelts and more dank, trash-strewn sets than I ever care to see again. Humphrey Bogart overacts, and this is an understatement. He chews up so much scenery he probally got indigestion when filming was done. Anyone who questions this movie's distinction as being one of the worst of the 20th century, has a few screws loose. A crime against celluloid.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Let me start by echoing others in saying that the title of this album is ridiculous and that the album cover is probably the Beatles' worst ever (not counting 70's compilations like 'Rock &amp; Roll Music'). And I, too, would have liked to see the release of the original Glyn Johns-produced 'Get Back' album, complete with the EMI House cover photo that was later used on the Red and Blue Albums.<br />It's pretty difficult to evaluate this album on its own merits since I'm so familiar with the 1970 version. The track listing is pretty close to the original, with the removal of &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and the addition of &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot; That's fine. But as I understand it this was always supposed to be a sort of &quot;live&quot; album and, as such, the studio banter is greatly missed. As others have pointed out, &quot;Get Back&quot; seems to stop short. This is because it lacks the extended outro of the single version and John's rooftop quips from the LP.<br />&quot;Dig a Pony&quot; appears to be identical to the original version, as do &quot;Two of Us,&quot; &quot;For You Blue,&quot; &quot;One After 909,&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine.&quot; Any differences are minor--slightly different balances in the mixing, etc.<br />&quot;I've Got a Feeling,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;Let it Be,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are the most changed. Of these four, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot; is closest to the version we're familiar with, but it falls short, in my opinion. In addition to apparently being a different take, the guitars are mixed too softly and the electric piano is too loud. &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; pales in comparison to the original single version. Again, the guitars are mixed too softly, and the part at the end where John's lead vocal is only audible through what I assume are instrument mics is missing completely.<br />&quot;Across the Universe&quot; has had all overdubs stripped from it, and is perhaps the most improved. Phil Spector really did do a number on this one.<br />The version of &quot;Let it Be&quot; that appears here is inferior both to the original album and original single versions. Here was a case where Phil Spector vastly improved the basic track, by adding echo and especially a new guitar solo to replace George's rather lame Leslie noodlings.<br />Spector's treatment of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; always seems to be held up as the canonical example of what was wrong with the album. Hearing this version is no revelation, since something similar was available on 'Anthology 3,' but I can understand Paul's desire to finally restore his untouched performance to the album. Yet we are left with something that almost sounds like a demo. In fact, the rest of the band almost seems superfluous on this one. Perhaps it would have been better with just Paul and a piano. I think Spector sensed it was missing something and simply went overboard. There is no question that without him this never would have been a hit single, however.<br />The 'Fly on the Wall' disc is interesting. The highlight for me is the 10-second snippet of John, Paul, and George singing &quot;All Things Must Pass.&quot; That would have made a stellar Beatles track--what a shame.<br />To conclude, if you're a new or a casual Beatles fan, skip this and get the original album. If you're a more serious fan or a collector, it's probably worth having, if only for the second disc, which contains pieces of what appear to be two previously unheard Lennon-McCartney tracks.<br />However, this release falls short of what I think it could have been. Perhaps in some time we will see the release of Glyn Johns' 'Get Back,' or even a box set on the model of the Beach Boys' 'Pet Sounds Sessions.' I am sure I would give those much higher recommendations.overdubs stripped from it, and is perhaps the most improved.

B00005JKC3|5.0|Yes!!! This is the best film released in 2003, if not the entire century so far! Ang Lee is a genius, he turns the once grim, dark portrayal of the Hulk and turns him into a bumbling clown. This lighthearted approach to the depressing subject matter really does it all; its like watching King Kong with John Candy in the lead role as the big ape. Final thoughts: King Kong is the best piece of celluloid film of all time, but avoid the remake.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy will remain one of the most argument's raiser between critics ,movie geeks ,mainstream Audience ,the loyal fans and the matrix's philosophy believers .<br />Actually the problem with The Matrix in general that it's a Huge multi layered world ,Actually a unique world created completely with details of it's own ,To make full understanding of this world you need several things ,One of them is the analytical ability to tie all the different keys and events together to form some vision about what's really happening , you simply can not view each one of the three movies like individual segments ,They are completely integral and viewing them as one unit is necessary to get the full picture ,Another thing  is that you have to have some background of Computer Sciences in general to make assumption for yourself and to understand completely the other assumptions introduced by it's creators (Especially in RELOADED) .<br />On the technical side RELOADED is simply a marvelous achievement ,The Special Effects were amazing ,Many people complained that there is nothing new after the bullet time ,But this is not right because simply the Bullet Time was not only a technique ,It was an INVENTION and inventions doesn't happen all the time ,What the Wachowskis done is improving it and it really were tweaked in RELOADED but some viewers didn't get rid off the feeling that they have seen the Bullet Time many many times before ,But this has nothing to do with the Wachowskis ,They have invented it and many entertainment forms ripped it from them , The fight scene where we watch neo fighting swarms of Agent Smith really proves that there are no limits for what they can do ,The other scene is the Highway chase which leaves you breathless during it's running time ,I haven't felt that there were overusing of the special effects at all ,You know they are in the Matrix world where no earthly rules are governing the characters ,And so the amazing fights were necessary to symbolize that ,The other elements like editing and musical score Along with the Decoration,Design and costume passed the test efficiently .<br />The wachowskis hits hard and solid this time ,With very huge budget they had a plenty of time and space to introduce what they want to say ,Their vision is marked for having no borders ,You are in some point in the movie and making anticipations or guessing about the forthcoming events ,they surprises you with ultimately different things ,And this leads us to discuss some aspects about The Matrix's World and the impact it have done on the cinema's Audience ,The problems that many complained about actually are several problems ,One of them is the Zion's people and their appearances but we have to be frank ,The movie is about a world where the machines is controlling it and only one place is left for al the surviving humans so what do you expect from them? do you expect them to be clean and shaven and wears the latest fashion models?! ,About the mass sex scene I think it was designed beautifully ,Just look where Neo And Trinity were making it and you will notice that the place is designed  in a Womb like shape ,It gives a reference for the creation of the humanity and the mass sex itself can be explained as human touch in a world threatened to be void of humans within a few hours ,It has been known that human beings in times of danger tends naturally to seek the warmth of other humans companion and this takes the form of the sexual festival we've seen ,The techno musical score  reflects the artificial nature of their surroundings .<br />Other people simply complained that the movie become very complicated ,That's may be right for the most of Mainstream Audience ,The whole trilogy needs an open mind willing to give a deep thinking sessions in order to get the message ,Many people of whom didn't like this movie were simply because they haven't understood it or simply thought about it as nonsense due to the large and heavy dose of philosophical battles ,Another people hated RELOADED because they had solid grounds based on the first Matrix movie ,Actually one Reloaded Excellency points came from taking the story in a whole new level and so it destroyed all of our beliefs granted from the first Matrix movie ,And this ofcource wasn't appealing for many viewers who didn't like the shaking new grounds beneath their feet's ,Some themes were implemented successfully to support the story like the scene where we see multiple copies of Agent Smith confronting Neo about The Purpose and how every BEING has an purpose ,In another scene where Persephone(Monica Bellucci) gets paid from Neo in order to show him the path to the Keymaker ,The way which she gets paid indicates her longing for humanity ,This added extra depth for the story and a new meaning for the humans to survive depending on their finding the humaninty  in the most unhumanable places ,This is another solid stone in the trilogy's Concrete ,So in order to enjoy RELOADED you to have to let your self get indulged in the Intensive action,Paralyzing discussions and the unbelievable atmosphere ,Set your mind free and you will enjoy a journey like no other journey .l battles ,Another people hated RELOADED because they had solid grounds based on the first Matrix movie ,Actually one Reloaded Excellency points came from taking the story in a whole new level and so it destroyed all of our beliefs granted from the first Matrix movie ,And this ofcource wasn't appealing for many viewers who didn't like the shaking new grounds beneath their feet's ,Some themes were implemented successfully to support the story like the scene where we see multiple copies of Agent Smith confronting Neo about The Purpose and how every BEING has an purpose ,In another scene where Persephone(Monica Bellucci) gets paid from Neo in order to show him the path to the Keymaker ,The way which she gets paid indicates her longing for humanity ,This added extra depth for the story and a new meaning for the humans to survive depending on their finding the humaninty  in the most unhumanable places ,This is another solid stone in the trilogy's Concrete ,So in order to enjoy RELOADED you to have to let your self get indulged in the Intensive action,Paralyzing discussions and the unbelievable atmosphere ,Set your mind free and you will enjoy a journey like no other journey .
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I was hesistant about buying this CD but I figure for $9.99 at Target wasn't bad.  I was astonished at the style, variety, and hiphop/pop feel and sound of the songs.  The best tracks are # 1 (The Zone),#2 Boom Boom (with the Ying-Yang Twins), #6 Toxic, #9 The Hook Up (my favorite and can't wait for the video), and # 11 Brave New Girl.  Maybe it is because Madonna, whose music I have loved for over 15 years, was on the 1st track but the style and coolness of the music sounded like Madonna.  This CD will give Britney more appeal, exposure, and sales.  The music has a style that will definitely be awesome in a club setting or as remixes.  Britney has come out of one zone into an awesome NEW ZONE...You go girl!

630522885X|5.0|Other women in the same time period became famous for their artistic talents(George Sand for one) but Lola Montes had no real talent and so she made her mark by being beautiful and aggressive. These qualities won her many admirers and at least two famous lovers: the King of Bavaria and Franz Liszt.  Its a complicated story though and one with many ironies. When Lola was younger her mother wanted to marry her off to a wealthy older banker but Lola refused and instead ran away with a young man who ended up being a drunk and a philanderer. We never really see Lola's transformation from young innocent girl into woman of the world but she makes the transition so completely that nothing of the little girl remains in the woman that Lola Montes becomes. The way Carol Martine plays her we assume that either Lola Montes has no emotions or that she has them but  has learned to keep them to herself.  Either way it seems what Lola really loves is a man who can take care of her in style and so the real love of her life is not Franz Liszt who she grows bored with but rather the King of Bavaria who sets her up in a little palace of her own which seems perfect for her (an icy palace in an icy land for the icy Lola). Later Lola will refer to this as the happiest period in her life but we are likely to attribute this happiness not to the elderly and deaf King of Bavaria himself but to the palace he provided her with. This was the one time in her life she had a home. When the stability of Bavaria is threatened by revolution she is forced out of her palace. Outside of Bavaria she is destitute and she has nothing to sell -- except her reputation.  Though penniless shes now become famous or infamous throughout Europe and so when Ustinov offers her a salary for merely telling her tale she has little choice but to accept. In the 21st Century we are so used to seeing how people capitalize on scandal that its fascinating to see a nineteenth-century version of this phenomena.  Its also fascinating to see how Lola Montes must play &quot;Lola Montes&quot;. There is a huge difference between what really happened and what the public wants to hear happened and so the story that Ustinov tells each night is just a fiction designed to give the crowd what it wants. Lola herself just goes through the motions of playing this fictive &quot;Lola&quot; to make a buck. In our media savvy era we might have a hard time seeing Lola Montes as a victim, rather we are likely to see her as someone cashing in on her &quot;fame&quot;.  Lola is ultimately a victim however in the same way Jay Gatsby was a victim -- they are victims of others misperceptions of them.  The misperception so often repeated takes on a larger than life reality while the real life is buried in the shadows.  This is the tragedy of fame, this is the tragedy of Lola.  It is perhaps the most fascinating study of personality of its era. And one that speaks to our era  most pointedly.ating to see how Lola Montes must play &quot;Lola Montes&quot;.

B0000DJZA5|4.0|Okay, I'll cop to the facts that this might be a totally uneccessary release, that it might be a McCartney vanity project, and that -- bottom line -- this is a pretty mercenary-minded piece of merchandise.<br />That being said, I'm still giving this album four stars for two reasons: First, I'll take exploitative hackwork from the Beatles all day long that I wouldn't take from any other band. I mean, come on... if you bought Anthologies 1-3 you have no business complaining about this disc, it's no less a shelf-clearing than those three albums. I'd buy albums like this all day long before I'd buy, say, &quot;Rumours... Redone&quot; from Fleetwood Mac.<br />Second, this album has some merit on its own, if only as a historical document. It by no means replaces the origional &quot;Let It Be&quot;: It's what we got in 1970, warts and all, and it still stands up. <br />The production on this album IS really good, and songs like &quot;Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; really ARE sharpened up. The version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is vastly improved, even over the version on &quot;Past Masters 2:&quot; It's stripped of the weird, noodley electric guitar, simple, plain acoustic guitar and sitar... heartbreakingly beautiful. <br />There are downsides, too: &quot;Get Back&quot; is weirdly truncated, and the origional solo on &quot;Let It Be&quot; was a lot more powerful. &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig it&quot; were throwaways, so you don't really miss them. I also agree this album is a missed opportunity of the highest order: Why not release the rooftop concert in its entirety in its proper context? I also miss John's banter -- the &quot;hope we passed the audition&quot; crack that closed the origional album was just perfect.<br />So, basically: You'll like this album if this is the sort of thing you like. If not, you won't. <br />If you bought Anthologies 1-3, there's no reason not to buy this, too.
6304973187|1.0|This movie doesn't make sense- the setting is in more modern form, but the language stayed the same as in old english. It was using machine guns in attempts of suicide and murder instead of daggers. I hated his movie. It was terrible. The only good thing I have to say about it was that claire Danes and Leonardo Dicaprio were good together in this movie.
6303471714|5.0|This video has always received horribly bad reviews but ironically, people always rave about it and the resuts you get. If you are completely out of shape, then yes, your body will not be able to handle the exercise, but that applies to any exercise program. I have over 50 workout videos and I always come back to this one when I need to get in shape because it really targets all muscle groups and it's got great music and beautiful scenery. I also love The Next Challenge which is a longer workout, but equally effective and yes, challenging. Cindy's videos are tough workouts and they are not for beginners, you could get hurt easily.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Well, I will add my comments to the already 1437 reviews already posted... Defintely much improved over the theatrical version. Much more is explained and much more makes sense. Though it is over 3 hrs too long to watch in one sitting, I would say it is a worthwhile purchase to any movie collection. Though some parts I found somewhat overly melodramatic, this extended edition as a whole works quite well. Though, strangely I had the most affinity for Gollum. He is the most fascinating and fully fleshed out and, perhaps the most human character in the whole movie, and perhaps in cinema in the past few years. He embodies all of the contradictions in being human, both good and bad, and yet he is neither. I really feel for the guy. I guess we all have a little Gollum in each of us. thumbs up

B0000CAQ27|4.0|I didn't like Pink's last cd at all. To me, it sounded like she was confused. Like she wasn't sure who she should be or what style of music she wanted to do. This time, it sounds like she may be on to something. The first single, \\"Trouble\\" has flopped but the song is actually very good and it reflects her personality. My favorite songs on this cd are \\"Last To Know\\" (that's an easy hit for her), \\"Oh My God\\" (very sexy and to the point),\\"Catch Me While I'm Sleeping\\" (R&B driven and she is  really blowing on this song), \\"Save My Life\\" (one of the most poppy songs on this cd), \\"Unwind\\" (a tribute to Janis Joplin) and the hidden track called \\"Hooker\\" (which is rumored to be about X-tina). The whole cd is good...she is growing vocally and with her songwriting. She is not at the point where she should be, but I can tell she is on her way.The only thing I didn't care too much for were some of the pics. Anyway, this is a good cd. Its good to know that there are females out there who still want to rock us with their music.
B000002L9W|5.0|Ok, so it's not really a Van Halen album--it's better than a Van Halen album. Do not get me wrong: I love the DLR-era Van Halen. During Roth's tenure they cranked out album after album of peerless pop rock, but sometimes the relative seriousness of Eddie and Alex threaten to overwhelm Dave's loony sleaze. You can almost hear the brothers telling him to calm down so they can play their synthesizers. Not so on this disc.<br />On EAT 'EM, Dave reaches his apotheosis. The opening to &quot;Yankee Rose&quot; distills Dave's musical persona to its joyous, leering, and strangely wistful essence. He clearly hasn't been taking his pills, and his backing band are the best hired guns in the business. Steve Vai's virtuosic noodling is the perfect complement to Dave: it's excessive, it's masturbatory, and it's frickin AWESOME. But one of the album's saving graces is that the band never upstages the frontman. This is Dave's show, &quot;and [it] is WILD!&quot;
B0000DJZA5|2.0|By taking out the dialogue, this has been made into an antiseptic, somewhat ordinary work. The point was to strip away Spector's figerprints, but they removed the charm as well. Far from being &quot;Naked,&quot; it actually sounds well-produced. These versions are for the most part ones we've heard before, so there's no great revelation. Many note that &quot;Anthology Disc 3&quot; provided better insights, and I agree; a good fifty percent of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; songs are on that disc! But the most egregious thing those in charge (and, contrary to many claims I've read in these reviews, I think Paul had less to do with this than many claim) did was to change the running order of the songs. Sorry -- once you're used to it, it doesn't pay to change the formula; you can't act as if the original never existed. <BR>SO -- if you really want a cool, alternate &quot;Let It Be,&quot; get the ORIGINAL &quot;Let It Be,&quot; the ANTHOLOGY 3 disc, and &quot;Let it Be NAKED,&quot; and then burn the following songs onto a CD in this order:<br />1. Two Of Us (Anthology 3)<BR>2. Dig A Pony (Anthology 3)<BR>3. Across the Universe (Naked)<BR>4. I Me Mine (Anthology 3)<BR>5. Dig It (Original)<BR>6. Let It Be (Anthology 3)<BR>7. Maggie Mae (Original)<BR>8. Medley: Rip It Up/Blue Suede Shoes (Anthology 3)<BR>9. Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues (Anthology 3)<BR>10. Old Brown Shoe (Anthology 3)<BR>11. I've Got a Feeling (Anthology 3)<BR>12. One After 909 (Naked or Original)<BR>13. Long and Winding Road (Anthology 3)<BR>14. For You Blue (Anthology 3)<BR>15. Don't Let Me Down (Naked)<BR>16. Get Back (Anthology 3)<br />Try it... it's very cool, and you won't feel as disappointed!
B0000028RR|5.0|RATM isn't your everyday oridinary band. I'll admit I'm a new Rage fan but I have heard them before, I just didn't really get into them.  They are the most creative yet innovative band I have heard.  They are a hell of a lot better than Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park.  (That doesn't say much.)  They take a little time to get use to but once you do you'll find yourself wanting to listen to more and more and more.  Evil Empire doesn't live up to this cd so I emplore you to get The Battle of Los Angeles .  If you don't turn on to Rage , Rage will turn on to you.
B0000CFWZA|5.0|This cd rocks! Honestly, I can't stop playing it. The first couple of times I listened to the whole cd I wasn't really sure if I was into it but the more I listened, the more I liked it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|We all have one cheesy CD that we pop in to cheer us up on a really bad day. Mine just happens to be Britney Spears' bubblegum sophomore offering, \\"Oops!...I Did It Again.\\" I admit it... I'm a Britney Spears fan. Yet with her new album, In The Zone, I can finally prove that she actually has musical talent (although it's up for grabs if it's actually her or whether it's her newfound team of songwriters and producers, which include the likes of Moby, Red Zone, the Matrix, and R. Kelly). <br />The most provocative track on the album, and my personal favorite, is the dance ballad \\"Touch Of My Hand,\\" which continues the musical influences of Asian electro-pop. In this song, Spears sings about indulging in herself. Another trancy track concerning Spears' sexuality is \\"Breathe On Me,\\" which is produced in the vein of Kylie Minogue. Although undeniably carnal yet equally evasive, Spears is most in her element during these two tracks, for she does what she is known for - coyly leaving the audience wanting more.<br />Spears is most inventive in the songs \\"Early Mornin'\\" and \\"Brave New Girl.\\" The first contrasts the gentle sounds of a piccolo with a slow, throbbing beat, to which Spears moans about one-night stands and a hangover. The latter is a dance track that combines Spears' rapping with an energetic chorus that reminds the listener of kitschy, European teen pop acts of the late `90's. The beats of the song are confident, and the chorus is remarkably tuneful. <br />\\"Me Against The Music,\\" Spears' first single from the album, which is performed as a duet with her very own idol, Madonna, only hints at her budding musical evolution. However, Spears doesn't do a complete 180 on this latest recording like her formal rival, Christina Aguilera, did on her last album, \\"Stripped.\\" Spears still stays closest to her pop roots on the tracks \\"Toxic\\" and \\"Outrageous.\\" However, \\"Toxic\\" stays fresh by being flavored with crashing violins while \\"Outrageous\\" incorporates some subtle SouthAsian musical influences. I also like the song \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom,\\" her duet with the Ying Yang Twins, who sing \\"Get Low.\\" The song changes her whole image and kind of reminds me of J. Lo on her album \\"J To Tha L-O!\\"<br />Spears' voice has reached an all-time low on this album (who knew it could get any worse?), and that is the primary lacking element. Her breathy voice has little range or power, and is flavored with synthesizers and computerized effects rather than raw emotion. Due to her lack of vocal talent, Spears lets herself be easily overpowered by a group of androgynous-sounding \\"back-up\\" singers, or she pseudo-raps. At present, Spears' voice is most comparable to Cher on her old hit, \\"Believe,\\" a mere sound-effect to the already capable electronic music. <br />Nevertheless, since this is an album that could easily slide into the genre of electro-dance pop of the gay club scene, Spears' lack of singing talent isn't a genuine problem. The only time her lack of vocal talent becomes most excruciatingly apparent is on the tranquil, music box-themed ballad, \\"Everytime,\\" a song penned by Spears that is far from her \\"Dear Diary\\" days (and an answer to her ex, Justin Timberlake's hit, \\"Cry Me A River\\"). Although the song is meant to be more dreamy than powerful, Spears' synthesizer-enhanced voice contrasts too heavily with the organic piano accompaniment. The song alone is pretty and doesn't overstep Spears' limited range, but Spears simply can't muster up decent vocal chops. Yet, regardless of Spears' voice, the music makes you want to get up, dance, and forget your troubles- a pretty good solution for one of those bad days! :)<br />This album is also similar to the album Music, by Madonna.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|i have to admit, it took me a while to fall in love with this album. i suppose i'm used to his older stuff - when his lyrics were chalk full of wit, cleverness, and twists of irony - but this album, i feel, he's not holding much back. <br />i saw him in concert a few days ago, and this has made me appreciate the album that much more. i think this is his first album being completely honest and clean; songs like &quot;want&quot; and &quot;oh what a world&quot; are haunting in their resonating sadness. of course, its not &quot;poses&quot; - could it ever be another &quot;poses&quot;?  do we want another &quot;poses&quot;? this album is exactly what you would expect of rufus, but more - and if you listen to it only once, you'll hear the triteness of simple lyrics. but i urge you to listen to it again, and again: there is so much sadness underneath that creates beautiful and heartfelt work.
B00005JKC3|1.0|For years I told my friends, &quot;Hollywood should hand over these superhero movies to artistic directors. Then you'd get some kind of innovation, not just an action movie with capes.&quot; Okay, I admit I was wrong. Ang Lee is just the man for the job, and the Hulk is just the right superhero, but this movie is horrible. None of the director's innovative ideas work.<br />Ang Lee must have been groaning when he sat in the editing room and looked at what the footage. The Hulk is the biggest problem --- he's computer-generated and he looks that way. His face isn't realistic, his hair doesn't move, and he leaps like a cartoon. When he's smashing tanks, the tanks are the only interesting thing on the screen. And then there's the principal actors. Nick Nolte shambles around, Eric Bana is extremely bland, and Jennifer Connelly needs to eat a full meal soon.<br />I had a lot of trouble getting through this movie. I used the fast-forward button a lot. I had to wait a long time for the Hulk to arrive and smash things. When he did, it was a disappointment. I'll bet the second disc of behind-the-scenes documentaries is well-done, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it. There's something depressing about watching a talented filmmaker build a bomb.
B000066C88|4.0|I found this movie extremely intriguing...at first I was overwhelmed by the amount of characters and speed of information whizzing by--it was difficult to connect them. Then everything started to gell, at the second dinner. I went back at this point and reviewed the build up and the connections really fell into place. Going forward again, the movie became more and more fascinating. I loved that no one really cared that Lord William was murdered, and the subtlety of the unravelling mystery. The end was very, very emotional. I was so haunted by all the details I felt compelled to go back again and see how Altman crafted his web. Fascinating. This is better than a formula mystery.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|When I was a teenager, I had this movie on video-disc. I watched it over and over with my brothers, fascinated by Pete Townshend's songs and Keith Moon's lunatic drumming. Then I grew up and the movie came out on VHS . . . but big chunks of it were missing.<br />Now it's been restored. The sound is perfect, the picture looks better than ever, and everything from the original documentary is back. This includes the infamous mini-opera, A Quick One While He's Away. This 7-and-a-half minute song marks the transition between the band's overheated R&amp;B and their art rock phase (in which Townshend tried to make sense of his stardom with a series of conceptual albums. Most of them worked, too). It's not easy to get into A Quick One the first time you see/hear it. You have to come back to it over and over until it sinks in and you realize what a breakthrough it was for the band.<br />The extras on the DVD are pretty good. The best extra bit is an interview with Roger Daltrey. He talks about how shocked Keith Moon was to see the final cut of the film, noticing how quickly he had aged. Daltrey also gives the full story on the exploding drum kit from the opening scene --- an explosion that knocked the singer to the ground and permanently damaged Townshend's hearing.<br />This is one of the best rock and roll documentaries you'll ever see. You get the full history of the band, with over a dozen complete performances. You'll see them as punk pop stars in the early days and (in their final performance with Keith Moon) as experienced and dedicated musicians. They never took the fame seriously (as you'll see in every interview segment), but they were serious about their music.
B00006690G|3.0|I used to detest Eminem for his attitude with other people who he doesn't like but he's a goood rapper. I really like the Eminem songs but rap isnn't my favorie kind osf music.He doesn&quot;t mind what people will think about his life, and he expresses what he fells and he thinks about the world. Sometimes he criticizes everthing but it could be constructive and he tells the truth and discusses actual topics and situations taht other singers don't express in their lyrics. This cd is an energetic album ut if you have time to read the lyrics you will enjoy it.
B000065V9Y|4.0|In the time when grunge music was at its peak, Peter Gabriel released US after a 5 year absence in recording (aside from Passion in 1989).  Many accused Peter of re-hashing 1986's SO and not moving forward musically.  Alternative grunge was stealing his low-attention span younger audience. <br />I can agree that \\"Steam\\" does have a \\"Sledgehammer\\" feel to it, but for the most part, US is totally different from SO.  Whereas SO was more of a breakthrough pop album, US focuses inward on Peter's relationships and yields some of his most expressive music yet without losing his pop sensibility. <br />\\"Come Talk To Me\\" is a great opening track mixing Scottish bagpipes with African drums... a simple combination that can be easily taken forgranted but is actually quite brilliant. \\"The Blood of Eden\\" stands out both lyrically and musically as a beautiful look at the beginnings of humanity. \\"Washing of the Water\\" (my personal favorite) is a gorgeous ballad yearning for spiritual guidance. \\"Digging in the Dirt\\" is classic Peter showing both sides of himself: the calm and the angry. This song especially sounds much better remastered.<br />The songs mentioned are my favorites, but all of them are good. The album as a whole has a theme of yearning for love and something more than just human love. This feeling was missing from Peter's earlier bodies of work and makes US special. A hidden gem in the early nineties while alternative rock was stealing the show. How ironic that Gabriel may have invented \\"alternative\\" music in the first place.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Let me start this review by saying I'm going to rate this album on the way I got it which was in November of 2002. Christina says goodby to her teeny bopper Britney rival days and puts herself in a whole new category with this one. I must say she passed all my expectations on this album. This girl can really sing, her voice has really matured from the last album b/c she didn't let go on that record. I have to admit when she first came out back in 99' I wasn't feelin her because all these females were coming out all at once and it just looked like they were all doing the same thing. But Christina has prevailed and stepped away and has prooved shes not just another girl, come on shes even won a grammy, that alone says how talented she is.<BR>1.) Intro- A good way to start the album, shes letting you know this is no joke.<BR>2.) Can't hold us down- The beat is really good and her voice is very strong. I love the feel of this song even though it's a female impowering song. Lil Kim also has something to say on this one also. 9/10<BR>3.) Walk Away- First ballad on the album, I bet alot of people can relate to this song going into bad relationships and stuff. Good ballad but not the best one. 8/10<BR>4.) Fighter- I love this song! what more can I say it has a good chorus and a good hook, so many words to say. The beat and rythem remind me of war and army uniforms. 10/10<BR>5.)Primer Amor intro- she just talks in spanish, an intro to the next song.<BR>6.) Infatuation- Very good song with excellent lyrics. It has a latin feel to it this song gets another 10/10.<BR>7.) Loves embrace intro- sets the tone for next song, nothing new.<BR>8.) Loving me for me- Another great song, the beat is very soulfull and chilling. I could see myself relaxing with this one. She sings in falseto the majority of the time. 9.5/10<BR>9.) Impossible- Great song, Alicia Keys helps her out on this one. I can really relate to this song, it's a real old fashioned song 60's -70's feel. 9/10<BR>10.) Underapreciated- I love this song , alot of people say it's just a filler but I am feelin this song all the way. Her voice sounds really strong on this, love all the insruments. 10/10<BR>11.)Beatiful- You guys know it, you heard it on the radio. To bad it wasn't #1 it peaked at #2, she almost made it. Not the best ballad to me but has a good meaning. 8/10<BR>12.) Make over- This is a very different song , you wouldn't expect it from Christina at all but here it is anyway. It is very rock oriented, the weakest on the albom to me but still is good.7/10<BR>13.) Cruz- Another ballad that has a rock edge to it. This song really grew on me and I happen to like it very much. It talks about moving on and leaving all the extra baggage behind. 9.5/10<BR>14.) Soar- Another ballad, it reminds me of Mariah but thats a good thing. Gospel type song, she hits a very high note at the end. 9/10<BR>15.) Get mine, Get yours- This song is my favorite one on the album. Her voice is very sexy on this one, talks about casual sex,the beat is very good. Naughty, Naughty girl Christina. 12/10<BR>16.) Dirty- Second favorite on the album, everyones heard it and seen the video. Luv it! 10/10<BR>17.) Stripped pt.2- Another intro rapps up that half of the album.<BR>18.) The voice within- The best ballad on the album and is now a single. Her voice is very powerful on this song also! Luv it to-10/10<BR>19.) I'm ok- Another ballad about an abusive father. I can relate to this song in every way. 9/10<BR>20.) Keep singin my song- another gospel type song, the voice is very strong. Good way to close the album. 9.5/10
0446677450|1.0|I've never quite seen someone who can fill over 150 pages with near useless drivel. Mr. Kiyosaki, goes on rabbit trails and is simply a salesman. I don't believe he knows very much about what he is talking about, and chooses to speak in generalities rather than specifics. You will walk away from this book a bit poorer in both time and money. If you're needing concrete investment strategy and facts, then look elsewhere.
0517221160|5.0|This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)

B00006CXXU|5.0|This album has been great inspiration for me. This girl knows how to put emotion into her song.Personally, my favourites are Beautiful, telling you that no matter what is different about you, you are still beautiful. The voice within, which tells you that when you have no-one to turn to, you just look inside to your soul and find the strength within. And lastly, a song that means a lot and actually made me cry was I'm Okay, where she talks about her father physically abusing both her and her mother. This album is a must and you are crazy if it doesn't get to you. an all time tear jerker. P.S the fact that I'm gay dpesn't have anything to do with it
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I own all her albums &amp; soundtracks, and I think that with this christmas album, she has delivered her best work yet!  Her delivery is so full of emotion (something that lacked on her earlier records) and her vocals are extremely strong.  Highlights are the haunting and powerful O Holy Night, the very original and uplifting Deck the Halls/Silent Night and basically every track.  <br />The production is TOP NOTCH!  And the vocals are TOP NOTCH!  It doesn't mean that she sounds like &quot;Saving All My Love For You&quot; when she was 21, the innocence is gone, but she sounds close to the Preacher's Wife, just a little deeper.  Her voice is now mature and full of emotion and soul.  In my opinion, her voice and singing is superior now because it's not bland like it was in the 80's.  But do not worry, with this album, she hits all the high notes and her vibrato is back.  She sounds much better then her last effort last year.<br />All the clips on amazon are taken from the beginning of the songs, so each song builds up later into something VERY special.
B00005JLYW|4.0|Ok - All of you who believe that the Charlie's Angels TV Show or Movies are meant to be serious will be disappointed with this movie.  For the rest, with the understanding that Charlie's Angels has always been &quot;just for fun&quot; will love this movie.  The girls click and deliver a fun action packed adventure.  :)  A Great &quot;Fun&quot; Movie.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I have been a fan of my-so called life for many years and i wish the show hadn't been cancelled but in reality it did.  When the annoucement was made that a dvd would be released i was so excited.  However the price of the dvd made me rethink my decision to purchase it, but i had an itch to see the show once more and i bought it.  I couldn't be happier with my new set.  It totally lives up to the expectations of the price and i can say that having the set makes me go back in time when i actually related with Angela and I recommend this dvd to all those who are willing to purchase the set regardless of the price.
B00005QCVY|2.0|Stewart gives an excellent performance to an otherwise silly tale.  Non-sensical, best left for children;  I did enjoy this each holiday season when I was a child.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|While some of the negative reviews are obviously by crank Beatle/McCartney haters, and thus can be discounted, there seems to be quite a bit of legitimate negative reaction from true fans.<BR>I think this is mainly due to two things: the terrible choice of title and the disingenuous way this album has been marketed.  They (Apple, EMI, whoever) have pushed it as if this really is how the Beatles wanted the album to be originally and implied that the LIB songs are being presented without Spector's production for the first time.  Well, how can it be the way the Beatles wanted when two of them are no longer with us to confirm that?  What evidence, for instance, is there that this is the track order they really wanted in 1969?  And, as others have pointed out,  &quot;naked&quot; versions of LIB songs are available on the Anthologies and Past Masters.  The \\"naked\\" marketing campaign might have made sense if LIBN had been released prior to the Anthologies. But at this point it's disingenuous to push LIBN as if de-Spectored LIB songs are something new. And the second disc is, basically, a disappointment.  Again, the marketing made fans - at least, this fan - think the second disc might be some of the LIB outtakes that have been bootlegged for so long, but we only get song snippets and chatter.  The marketing shouldn't have promised - or at least, implied  - what it wasn't going to deliver. Hence - disappointment and negative reaction.<br />The sound on LIBN is, without doubt, clearer but, really, I don't feel LIBN surpasses the original.  LIBN loses some of the character and feel of the original with the funny Lennon comments and \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It\\" removed and the tracks rearranged.  It made sense to have &quot;Get Back&quot; as the last track with Lennon's &quot;hope we passed the audition&quot; comment.  You really miss that.  And the misleading marketing leaves a bad taste in your mouth.  So, there is merit to some of the negative reaction.  But nevertheless - asa Beatle-holic - I'll take \\"new\\" or alternate versions of Beatle songs any way I can get them.  So, I'm not as thrilled with this release as I would have liked to have been, but I'm going to keep my copy and hope they do a better job on the next Beatles project. Maybe consulting with fans would be a good idea.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Rules the music world. No wonder she is the QUEEN OF POP. This is the best album released so far. I had been literally counting days and hours for November 19th the day this album was gonna be released and as i had anticipated this was gonna be a #1 Chart Topper. The music is amazing. <BR>Too bad though it was just released in US. Indian Fans dont get Britney quickly. So i ordered the CD from US though it cost me 6 times more than the original price, but it was really worth. This CD is gonna be one of my most priceless ones.<BR>Go britney go.... we are waiting...
B0000DJZA5|1.0|LIBN purports to provide stripped down versions of the songs that Phil Spector added choirs, strings and horns to.  Well, that has been done before.  Check out the Anthologies and Past Masters.  So, since we already had all the Let it Be material in \\"naked\\" format, then why release the whole album with content removed - no matter how insignificant the content?  And if it's supposed to be \\"Let it Be\\" as the Beatles originally intended, well, I'm sorry, it isn't even that.  \\"Across the Universe\\" wasn't originally recorded for LIB and  \\"I Me Mine\\" wasn't recorded during the January 1969 LIB sessions.  In keeping with the original concept, then, they shouldn't be on the album.  I'm glad they are but strictly speaking, their presence does violate the original concept.  So LIBN is no more legit in that regard than LIB was.  Alternate versions of Beatle songs are always nice to have.  Fine.  But this business of LIBN being pushed as the real LIB is bogus.  If the idea behind Let it Be Naked is to supercede the original Let it Be, then all this release really accomplishes is the removal of Beatles material.  And that's the last thing I want, no matter how insignificant the material.  I wouldn't want Abbey Road released with \\"Her Majesty\\" removed any more than I want Let it Be with \\"Dig It\\" removed.  With 2 CDs they could have put a lot more material on this release.  There's no need to remove anything. What a disappointment.  And the title is god awful  . . . I'm still cringing.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|We've seen George and friends playing together in a super band a few times - on Bob Dylan's birthday, with the Traveling Wilburys, or in one of the get togethers with Ringo (e.g. for the recording sessions of Vertical Man). The results were never disappointing, and it had to be great for one last time. It feels weird to see that time went by so fast and many of the musicians look older, but boy, how sweet can they play...<br />This is certainly one of the best concerts I have ever seen: Good music, great production and a very well organized DVD presentation. It is definitely worth its price.<br />With so much love in the air that day, George, we could feel you and your guitar there.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is her best album to date. Album has same sexy, cool, club feel through out, but has different sounds stemming from different genres of music. If you want to dance, bump your head, or just chill off a nice sexy cut; this album fits your needs. If you like Madonna's Ray of light, Kylie Minogue, and a little hip hop appeal. You'll love this disc. This album is for everyone,it's the hottness.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This is not and never was a collection of the Beatles' best tunes, but even what they tossed off was better than most.  Changing the order of the songs was a good idea; they actually seem to flow, both musically and thematically. The last 3 tunes here illustrate their individual philosophies - George's selflessness, John's existentialism, Paul's stoicism. Nearly every song benefits from removal of the Spectorization.  The Long and Winding Road, though sparse and still lyrically sappy, now has a nice piano figure in place of the emetic string-syrup. The naked version of Across the Universe is beautiful.<br />Disc 2 is something you might play once or twice - mostly snippets of studio conversation that sound like a marriage ending...Paul talks about planning a future direction for the band, while the others all seem to know it's over.<br />Of their original studio releases, Let It Be was the only one I hadn't purchased on CD.  Glad I waited; this is a bit better.
0380789035|5.0|When I first started this book I had no idea what Gaiman's style was. So I had a very hard time getting over the very fictional and unreal events happening in what he painted as a very natural and real world. Now I realize this IS Gaiman and he uses his unique style to make some of the best stories. I call them stories because, when reading any of his writtings, you get the feel that someone is sitting down with you in conversation and has you spell struck with one heck of a story. Very unlike many novels these days.
1878424319|5.0|It's a very easy read. The application is very hard but worthwhile. You have to figure out how to apply the agreements to each situation in your own life and then actually apply them. It takes awareness, discipline and being honest with yourself.  Don't expect any magic that will change your life just by reading this book. You have to apply it to reap the benefits.
0380789019|5.0|For some reason while I was reading this book one word came to mind: colorful. Even though it's pretty much a &quot;dark&quot; setting, this book was able to connect each and every character to the reader with such a vibrant relationship. There is really never much of any downtime whatsoever throughout the story. The events that take place are incredibly unique, unpredictable, and always worth your time. <br />I was truly disapointed when I was on the last few pages of the book only because that was it. It killed me knowing that the adventure was over. Needless to say that the story was very nicely wrapped up. <BR>Gaiman IS storyteller.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|Come on now fellas.Once again the most hyped band of the last five years have produced an album of stagnant, unimaginative pop.It must have taken them about 10 minutes to write the whole album.It's one of the shortest albums in history (just over half an hour in duration).Once you hear the first few songs you start to realise that they're on autopilot.A few choppy chords here, Julian Casablancas' voice distorted on every song yet again.Come on Julian.What are you afraid of? Why won't you sing a song out straight without distortion.<br />There is nothing on this 'new' album or in the songs that differs whatsoever from the first album.For a band that is so hyped up, it's a huge letdown to realise that the great swindle is still in play.<br />The Strokes are definitely on the way out now that they've proved that they cannot do better than their poor debut.I could list the songs out here and describe them all but they are all so similar that I can only describe them all as boring.<br />Do yourself a favour and buy an old Blondie or Television album and you will hear what punk pop SHOULD sound like.Not this derivative garbage.
B000002J1M|4.0|A lot of Genesis albums are hit-or-miss.  Even with Gabriel at the helm, some things didn't always work on the early albums.  For my money, _Foxtrot_ is their best progressive rock album.  _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_ and _Selling England By The Pound_ might be more routinely listed as their best early work, but I think _Foxtrot_ has less filler than those two albums.  The best cuts include the classic &quot;Supper's Ready,&quot; as well as the heavy &quot;Watcher of the Skies.&quot;  &quot;Get 'Em Out by Friday&quot; might be the album's best track, incorporating Gabriel's aggressive and alternatingly whimsical singing/shouting with a very 70s-ish progressive rock bass line a la Chris Squire.  As a huge fan of 70s Yes, _Foxtrot_ remains my favorite progressive rock album from Genesis.
B000005IU1|5.0|When I first heard The Stooges, I was blown away. It was as though I had been asking a question about what music was &quot;it&quot; my whole life without knowing I was even asking, until I heard them and then I knew the answer. This band is to me unlike any other, which I think is the only thing that can make music truly stand up for itself, much in the way good art is not about micicry but truth, solidity, and satasfaction... with just enough of a nervous edge to keep you hungering for the song to continue, or the painter to paint again. Those music purists out there will know what I mean.<BR>I have not heard anything this blatantly pure and satasfying since I was lucky enough to be introduced to the New York Dolls -not to say that they sound the same. These are the people to turn to when you need that certain music fix that just won't be satiated otherwise.
B000002H97|5.0|This album put Metallica over the top . So they got new fans and they had Bob Rock produce it . Guns and Roses anyone ??? Remember them ??? This hasd great songs and the tour they did was very good as well . sorry Jason is gone though !!!
B0000029GA|5.0|People just be real you hate to admit but this is the greatist of all time. Come on N.Y. State of Mind, One Love is just the best songs in the album. So if You get this you will like it.

B00005QK3W|1.0|Paul McCartney is one of my all time rock n' roll heroes! Much like Michael Jackson's most devoted fans, I look for reasons to exonerate Mr. McCartney from any alleged acts of criminality even when all evidence begs for suspicion of guilt. Enter Driving Rain. I have owned this CD for over a year. I attended the supporting concert meant to drive sales upward while giving we fans a chance to see our hero perhaps in his last days as a performer. It is in this live concert setting that the excellence of the past most vividly illuminates the sub-mediocrity of the present. The absolute perfection of lyrics such as those contained in Blackbird, Yesterday, I've Just Seen a Face, and countless other examples of sheer brilliance, are made to reside on the same stage with the pure dribble of songs like She's Given up Talking (Don't say a word, Even in the classroom, She's not a dickie bird????), Driving Rain (12345 Let's go for a drive????), etc. What were you thinking Paul? I've tried to reconcile the Paul McCartney of yore with Sir Paul of Heather-ville but it's like the creative being that inhabited the bass playing body that was one fourth the force known as The Beatles left the planet some time ago, and we are left with the less than average musician who composed (loose useage of the word) and played on Driving Rain. I am certain that my analysis of this CD is in no way affected by the comparison of Sir Paul McCartney (present) to the impossible standards set by McCartney of yore. In fact, it would be unfair to expect anyone to sustain that level of creativity. It is just unfortunate that in the face of having nothing worthwhile to say musically or lyrically, Mr. McCartney chose to release a CD called Driving Rain. If one hasn't anything good to say of another, it is best to say nothing (my mother use to say). I say, if one has nothing to say, maybe he should find a different way to say it. I love you Paul! signed - a fan
B0000DZTIW|4.0|There will, no doubt, be comments comparing Hans Zimmer's capable score for Edward Zwick's &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; with other works, &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot; come to mind. And there are elements of this score that do remind you of both.  But there is much to be admired and enjoyed in this orchestral score.  Zimmer offers a very introspective and melodic approach which may surprise some.  There are dramatic cuts, as well, and &quot;Red Warrior&quot; is the best of these.  Here Zimmer combines his thematic material with rousing Samurai chants for a moving climax.  There are a few moments when Zimmer is a bit too modern, but they pass and are quickly overshadowed by better elements.  Zimmer is also quite adept in this score at combining Japanese motifs and Western themes without overt stereotypes.  Very well produced and packaged by Elektra.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Buy this album even if you have Let It Be (clothed).  It is incredible, and - to me - a more pleasing re-mix.  Its more raw, gritty, and emotional.  You can feel it on you and smell it on you, and you cant help but let it invade your heart, for it is an indespensable collection of songs that will forever remain an entrancing experience to listen to.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Any diehard Who fan already has paid at least 25 bucks for the bootleg version of The Vic show presented here on disc 2.  So dropping that amount here for the best sounding version of the &quot;Who's Next&quot; album AND a tremendous sounding live concert from the Vic on the second disc in a no brainer.  Not much can be said about the &quot;official&quot; album that has not been said already.  The abandon Lifehouse project, etc. etc. When all is said and done, &quot;Who's Next&quot; is  the best album the Who has ever done (if not one of the top rock records of all time).  It has never sounded better than it does here.<BR>My joy on this set was created by Moon's brilliant drumming on the live show.  Moon's drumming on &quot;Pure &amp; Easy&quot; may be the best rock drumming ever recorded live.  While the Vic  show does not match the youthful power of &quot;Live At Leeds&quot; or the &quot;sonic&quot; intensity, the musicianship of the band on this set is at it's peak. There is much more restraint and precision in their playing; which is exactly what these Townshend compostions required.    In addition, Daltrey's voice is much more powerful and soulful than on the &quot;Leeds&quot; album.<BR>For anyone interested in starting a &quot;Who&quot; collection this Deluxe Edition is the best place to start.  The Who in studio and recorded live in one 2 cd set, ya' can't beat that.  I would give this 100 stars if I could; because to me &quot;Who Next&quot; is a classic work of (musical) art.<BR>And do not let the price scare you away....it is worth every penny.  You will not be disappointed.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|Let me start off by saying one thing:<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF UTTER CRAP!!!<br />That out of the way...<BR>I loved the first &quot;Charlie's Angels&quot; film, I thought it was very refreshing to see a new action comedy that was actually funny and had good action.<BR>&quot;Full Throttle&quot; is nothing like that.<br />The only good thing about the movie is the eye candy. That's it. Period. Otherwise...<BR>Plot? Was there a plot?<BR>The CGI was some of the worst I've seen.<br />Script...what script?<BR>Point? No point here.<BR>Action? Crap.<br />Just atrocious.<BR>Terrible.
B000001ELF|4.0|Ace Frehley....although he is only 1 of the 4 founding members of the original band, his guitar sound is what made Kiss one of rocks best bands.  Hum...that might be my personal opinion, but just go back and track the success of every Kiss album after his departure (he did not play guitar on \\"Creatures Of The Night\\" even though he appears on the cover).  So, take Ace & his guitar add \\"David Letterman Band\\" musicians Will Lee on bass & Anton Fig on drums  and you have one killer band; and one great hard rock album.  A must purchase for any Kiss fan.  Far and away Frehley's is the best of the 4 solo albums.  Gene Simmons still can't deal with it!
B0000DD79B|4.0|I love this album and think it is a must own for S&amp;G fans.  The remastering offers fantastic clear sound and the producer chose some of the best cuts of their classic hits, particularly several live pieces.  The mixing is consistently excellent and the line up flows well from piece to piece.  A few songs from older albums I think are a bit grainny, which is cleaned up here nicely.  The album also includes many of their greatest folk hits so it will offer great appeal to fans who lean in that direction.<br />That said, it is no replacement for owning the full set of other classic albums.  As these singers aged, their style evolved considerably, so the only way of hearing that change is to own the earlier classic albums. Moreover, S&amp;G's body of work remains so large that these two discs could not contain it all, though they could have fit well over another half hour of music on these discs and I am annoyed by the wasted space.  Certain great songs are also left out, such as Kodachrome and 50 ways to leave your lover.  As I said, the focus here is on the folk music instead of their work that verged more toward rock.<br />None of this, however, should detract from the great pleasure S&amp;G fans will take from this excellently remastered album.
0425170349|2.0|When I was a teenager, I burned through all of his early books in a few days, completely absorbed in the exciting military battles and intriguing political maneuvering. But it's clear that starting with this book, Clancy has run out of boogiemen. I'm an environmentalist, and although his topic of environmental terrorism didn't insult me, the bumbling, utopian narrative spewed by the disturbed tree-huggers did make me cringe. I remember turning each page, hoping, begging, to find something interesting to grab onto, but in the end it was a giant letdown. He started to lose it somewhere around Debt of Honor, but this is sure proof that he simply ran out of enemies. How much more Robby Jackson talking jive can you take? Or Ding spewing his East L.A. street-slang? The characters and plots are now cliches. Oh well-it was good while it lasted.

B00005JMFO|5.0|This movie was fantastic.  It made me laugh, but there were also serious moments.  Hugh Grant as PM is adorable, Colin Firth thinking out loud because his housekeeper doesn't speak English is hilarious, and the kids are great throughout the film.  The nudity didn't bother me as much as it seemed to bother some reviewers, as I thought it actually made sense with the plot line of the couple.  My only complaint is that I do wish some of the stories were more definitively completed, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment as I still give it 5 stars.
B000055ZDT|5.0|it is unreal, the grooves are huge, the sound is gigantic, it is slow as... and when i listen to I, the Witchfinder it makes me want to kill people and die at the same time(in a good, evil way).  buy this if you like thick, heavy, fuzzed out doom/stoner rock. the vocals rule too, cuz they don't sound like grief or eyehategod(though i love them too). it will make your ears bleed!  if some dude walks in and says 'hey man is that staind? blah blah blah' the music will crush his chest and kill him and you will watch and say 'whoa, far out.'...
B00005YW4H|5.0|Sade is my favorite but Norah Jones is truly talented.  The CD is the best.  Norah Jones is beautiful, artistic and gifted.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Just got the soundtrack. It's great. I'm one of the fans that literally cry at the movies, but I never cry at the soundtrack. Well, the first time I listened to FOTR and TTT I never cried. This one I cried all the way through tracks 15 - to then end. I had to stop listening to it I was crying so hard. All I can see is the ending. Howard Shore has out done himself once again. No composer has captured the perfect music for a movie before this. These 3 soundtracks are my absolute favorite and nothing will ever change that. This is definately the CD to buy if you are easily touched by music.
B00004Z4WR|3.0|Great cast.  Competent direction.  Some very funny dialogue (written by the guy who wrote Con Air-A way better movie).  The problem with this movie is there isn't enough car chases or car wrecks like the original.  The characters and dialogue was okay but for a movie like this to not have more action is unforgiveable.  See 2 Fast 2 Furious if you want a good car chace/racing flick with good pacing.
B00005QG9J|5.0|There are Certain albums that you seem to be able to play over and over again and never get sick of it, and i must say this is certainly one of them. The album has a form of multi-mood vibe to it which means it is playable at all times. I am surprised to see that a lot of reviewers seem to dislike &quot;just a Phase&quot;. I Find the bellowing and harmonising sounds of Mikeys and Brandons voices at the start of the song to be one of the high points of the album. The intro of circles is one of those riffs That really makes want to see them live. Throw in other classics such as &quot;are you in&quot;,&quot;Mexico&quot; and the foundations are in place for a quality album. The last tune &quot;Aquarious Transmission&quot; is in a way a song that casts you away to sleep with that indian styled sound coupled with Complementing strings instruments. (good thing for those who like myself like to listen to music before going to sleep). For those musical snobs who regard incubus as being too mainstream for their ,Original wannabe musical tastes. Just buy it and dont tell anyone and i promise by the 3rd listening you may actually find yourself singing Morning view songs while sitting on the bus to where ever your going.
B000059LGC|5.0|I am obsessed with Poirot films.  This is one of my favorites.  My personal favorite is Murder on the orient express.  I like Ustinov's Poirot better than Finney but it is not nearly as good as David Suchet's on BBC and public television.  Death on the nile is a very well made mystery film directed by John Guillermin (the guy who did Towering Inferno and the King Kong remake).  I particularly like David Niven and Mia Farrow in this one, and Maggie Smith who seems to always be good.  If you're a Poirot fan then this is must see.  I also recommend Evil Under The Sun and Appointment in Death.
B00000JGHL|4.0|This is one of the best crime-drama movies during the late 1990s.  It was filled with a great cast, a huge storyline, and many of the players involved gave great performances.  Pacino was great; he should have been nominated for something.  John Cusack was good too, as long as the viewer doesn't mind his Louuu-siana accent.  He may come off as annoying if you can't stand this dialect.  The way that Pacino's character interacted with Cusack's character was believable, dramatic, and slightly comical at times.  Danny Aiello was superb as always.  David Paymer was great in a supporting role. Bridget Fonda was good but not memorable.   <BR> There were times when this picture mentioned so many characters, probably too many.  It may take a second viewing to remember, \\"which Zapatti was which?\\"  After so many cross-references, one has to stop and think just to recap.  <BR>The ending didn't have a lot of sting.  It was built up for so long in a good way and then was a little bit of a letdown.  This was one of the few letdowns in the film<BR> I think that since the movie wasn't billed as a huge, blockbuster big screen hit, it made some forget that this movie even existed.  Pacino was great but the film's lack of \\"splash\\" in the theaters may have accounted for no nominations.  It was semi-successful in the home market, and viewers are still learing that this title is out there.  Made in 1996, it still stands up seven years later and should still be popular for many years from now.    <br />So, make yourself some lemon pudding (you'll see) and rent this movie!  Overall, a great picture.  <BR>4 ½ out of 5!!!
B00006879E|5.0|Maroon 5 has become, by far, my favorite band!  Songs About Jane has been in my CD player constantly since August.  Every son captures emotion, especially Harder to Breathe, Tangled, Secret, Through With You, Not Coming Home, and Sweetest Goodbye.  I recommend this CD to anyone who is tired of the crappy pop music that is littering the airwaves.  Adam Levine has such a great voice, and if you ever get the chance to see this band in concert (which I just did!) you will love them twice as much for their fun personality and energy-charged stage performance.  And unlike some bands, they sound just as amazing live as they do on CD.  I promise you won't regret this purchase!  I bought it having only heard Harder to Breathe, and it was the best random purchase I've ever made.
B0000C2IQD|3.0|Well...after all the waiting, it's finally landed.  I wish I could say that it's truly scrumptious, but in truth, from the ashes of disaster (the previous DVD release) grow the roses of mediocrity.  Like so many DVD \\"special editions\\" of late (A Christmas Story, Willy Wonka, etc), this one is a bit short on the \\"special\\".<br />The film itself is presented in two formats on the first disc.  Both widescreen and pan & scan.  The widescreen transfer is just slightly wider than the laserdisc release and the colors seem to me to be about the same, though my laserdisc is rotting and the colors are a bit compromised.  It might be worth getting for the widescreen alone if you don't already have at that aspect ratio.  Also on disc one is the \\"sing along\\" feature and a preview of the musical which only succeeds in demonstrating how fat Michael Ball is. <br />Disc two (home of the real disappointments) has a conversation type \\"documentary\\" with Dick Van Dyke (and ONLY Dick Van Dyke) where he reminisces about some of the cast.  Another new feature is with Pierre Picton, owner of the nicest of the on-screen cars and it's kind of a fun look at the eccentric who owns and cares for the car.  There are 3 vintage featurettes, one with designer Rowland Emett which is interesting, another which is apparently a press conference with Dick Van Dyke (boring) and the last \\"featuring the children\\" (but not really).  One excellent special feature (and kudos to the person responsible!), is the inclusion of more than a dozen of the Shermans original demos for the film. <br />There are about 7 trailers for the film, both theatrical and television, but not the one which followed the film on the laserdisc version which, to me, seems like the genuine trailer.  It is presented on the DVD in French, but not in English.<br />The remainder of the special features are kiddie things like digital coloring book, inventor games, etc.<br />I'm sure money may have been the reason for not presenting a more professional and interesting supplement.  Sally Ann Howes is alive and well...I've seen her in NY.  The kids, Heather Ripley and Adrian Hall, attended the premiere of the stage show in London, so they're definitely locateable.  Very little is said about the locations or the production of the film.  I was expecting a documentary of the caliber on MGM's Bond DVD releases given that the production company was largely the same.  At least pay Dick enough to do a running commentary!  Shame on you, MGM.<br />Perhaps what disappointed me most of all is that I feel that I could have made a better effort.
B0000C0FJB|2.0|So, I have been a Rush fan for over 15 years now and endured all the hazing and crap from my friends for listening to &quot;Geekbanger music&quot; because I was just so blown away by their talent, style, intelligence and completely unique sound.  I own all their albums and of course rushed (no pun intended) out to get this one the day it was released.<br />I am so disappointed in my boys.  I think I know why they wanted to release this album, and that is, they wanted to relay some of the incredible energy that they encountered in Brazil playing before their biggest crowd ever.  We are talking about a frenzied stadium-full mob of people just screaming and having the time of their life.  That energy is very palpable, and it is abundantly clear that it helped the boys really throw out their best to the crowd.  The little booklet that comes with the discs has Neal Peart writing about the whole experience that just blew them away in the sense they had never encountered such energy before, and we're talking about guys who've been doing this for quite a while now.  For God's sake, the crowd sings along with YYZ, and that's an instrumental number!<br />OK, that's what gets them the two stars...unfortunately, the sound really is as bad as many people here state it is.  I am no audiophile but I have a decent system and I have to admit - it sucks!  The quality is comparable to a mildly enhanced digital mini-disc recording.  In the liner notes, Peart states that the recording was made by some local mobile van crew and that despite heavy remixing and re-working by Alex Lifeson and them, that there are &quot;limitations.&quot;  I would have hated to hear what it sounded like before they tried to do something with it.  <br />The reason for the poor recording is simply this - they never intended to release this as an album, so they didn't have a full set-up to do the recording.  Most bands have some sort of recording of their bigger concerts, but not for general release.<br />The truth is that &quot;Different Stages&quot; has virtually all of these songs - also live, and infinitely better recorded - although, granted, they are not from a single venue but rather from several tour stops in time.  The songs are pretty much identical except for a few minor changes here and there...and even the drum solo that everyone raves about, is exactly the same solo performed by Peart in &quot;Stages&quot; except there it is called &quot;The Rhythm Method&quot; and is far crisper, sharper and more discernable than this version in Rio.  And one of the greatest things about Rush, Geddy's shrill vocals, are drowned out, almost completely at times.<br />If you are a die-hard fan that has to buy all of the albums for posterity's sake (sort of like mylame ass) then buy it, but otherwise, skip it, buy &quot;Stages&quot; instead, far better sound, mixing and overall production.<br />Sorry guys, I really tried to like it...
B000065U1N|5.0|This should be required viewing for all Americans on the day before thanksgiving.  As Americans we have so much to be thankful for, but freedom isn't free.
B0000TB050|5.0|I have seen U2 live many times in person and have a pretty thorough collection of live footage. Some officially released and some bootlegs. I have never seen the band having this much fun while performing! It makes an already &quot;great&quot; live band reach even higher ground. This is by far the best concert footage ever... Everyone from the most remote U2 fan to the die-hard U2 fan should own this... Um, er, even if you hate U2 you should own this... It's that good.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's hard to say what Firefly would have become had it not been cancelled after it's first season, but it had the makings of the best show I've seen in quite a while.  It's just one of those gems that all too seldom make it to you TV screen, a well-written series in a well-crafted world full of interesting characters who you actually care about and enough material in their histories alone to have kept the series running for years without getting old.  It's a shame that a combination of expensive sets and high production values combined with poor ratings doomed it, but I would highly recommend to anyone who is a fan on the sci-fi genre (and many who are not) to pick up what few episodes were made.
B00003CXA2|5.0|If you like Tom Hanks then you will love this movie.  A must see for any movie fan.
B000008LOV|5.0|Unbelievably, this CD went out of print for a few years, but fortunately for lovers of good music it's back.  Every song on this album is brilliant; it's that simple.  Many &quot;supergroup&quot; projects are doomed to failure when the individuals involved don't really gel as a group, or worse, go into the studio and lay down a track without ever seeing the other performer.  The &quot;Duets&quot; debacle of a few years ago is a case in point.  In contrast, this group of performers work together flawlessly to create something truly special.<br />If you are a fan of Roy Orbison, George Harrison (who really shines here), Tom Petty or Bob Dylan alone, you will love them with the others.  If you are a fan of two or more of these guys, you are in for a real treat.
0920668372|1.0|This is the only book I've ever actually thrown in the trash.  Read the reviews to judge for yourself... even the 5-star reviewers rave about how it makes them cry every time they read it.  What child needs to see their mother crying all the time?  Can't we just let our kids be kids without having to lay on the heavy-duty stuff?  Making them think of the time when their mother will lay dying?  There are better, happy ways to convey what love is without laying on the concern and guilt that this book brings.  Read it for yourself if you need your own reminder about what love is... in my opinion, children don't need it.
B00006AW2S|4.0|The Rolling Stones' &quot;Out Of Our Heads&quot; is widely regarded by critics as one of those albums that contains two or three classics, while most of the other tracks are merely filler. And simply put...for once, the critics were right. Of course, the album contained two of rock and roll's most requested songs--'(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' and 'The Last Time,' the two of which featured some of rock's most identifiable guitar work. Elsewhere, with the exception of 'Play With Fire,' the album is littered with the group's blues influences, which are as obvious as ever, but it remains true that some of the territory they covered on this album can only be used so many times before they become tired. Nonetheless, &quot;Out Of Our Heads&quot; is still full of spirit, capturing some of the Stones' most soulful studio moments.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|As everyone else has stated, this is a wonderful score, I highly recommend it. <br />However, i'm VERY disappointed because the music from the RoTK trailer is NOT on the soundtrack.

I REALLY hope that the RoTK trailer music is on the enhanced soundtrack, as it is said that it will contain many soundtrack &quot;rarities&quot;.
B000002KYR|5.0|&quot;Eliminator&quot; introduced the world to one of rock's most unique sounds from one of rock's most unique bands, ZZ Top. Past albums like &quot;Tres Hombres&quot; or &quot;Deguello&quot; had firmly established the band as a major draw, but it was with this 1983 album that the band first used an appealing blend of technology that was perfectly topped onto their trademark R&amp;B/Delta blues roots.<br />The vocals and bass of Dusty Hill are as rough as the Texas sand, matched only by that of Billy Gibbons (who was a favorite guitarist of Jimi Hendrix), backboned by Frank Beard's disciplined drumming. All of this makes for a tightly wound musicianship that never suffers from &quot;Eliminator&quot;'s synthesized element. The album spawned several hits, notably 'Legs,' 'Sharp Dressed Man,' and 'Gimme All Your Lovin'. 'Got Me Under Pressure' is just as legendary, being an enduring ZZ Top favorite. The one-of-a-kind 'Thug' meanwhile is a darker tale, and features an incredinbly funky bass texture, while the likes of 'TV Dinners' and the incredibly eye-roll inducing 'I Got the Six' are somewhat less serious, but just as memorable. 'I Need You Tonight' however is surprisingly sympathetic and features some of Gibbons' best guitar work.<br />Although &quot;Eliminator&quot; became one the 80s most recognizable efforts, it finally gave ZZ Top the worldwide success they'd deserved since the early 70s. It is very much a male-ego album, containing the brilliant arrogance and flashiness that made ZZ Top so great in the first place.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Having produced most of their entire work, George Martin was nearly as instrumental a part of the Beatle sound as their harmony was. As much as I loved the songs of the original album, I always deplored the fact that Martin had not been given the chance to mix this album. Instead, we were crushed under Phil Spectrum's Wall of Sound approach and the sound quality suffered for it: the strings were always far too much. Unfortunately for the original, and for the early solo efforts of John and George, Phil was in vogue at the time. Maybe this release will kick off a whole new mixing and release frenzy...<br />Anyway, this album will not replace the original Let it Be release - there is room and reason for both. But for those of us who love the music (and that's the key - to love the music) there is a magical attraction to the personability, intimacy and closeness of this album's sound.<br />And yes, the cover sucks and the second CD is worthless... the point being...?
B000002KGT|5.0|On one level, this album is nothing more than slightly overengineered, light California pop from the late '70s. For example, the vocal harmonies on Christie McVie's &quot;Don't Stop&quot; are not far removed from the Beach Boys. Stevie Nicks voice was still cutsie, and lacks the bite which made her so great on the live &quot;The Dance&quot; DVD. <br />Yet there is a quality about this album transcends the slick pop surface. I think it is because this album is one of contrasts. It may be contrast between the emotional impact of the lyrics and the mystically happy music. Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham were breaking up, as were Christine and John McVie. The lyrics deal with difficult emotions, the loss of relationships and the fear of being alone and abandoned -- the anger, wind of uncertainty and self doubt at the end of a significant committed relationship. They stand in brilliantly dark contrast to the slick, polished music which accompanies them. Or perhaps it is the ability of Lindsey Buckingham to rip of a tight, gut renching rock guitar solo in the middle of a light pop tune. Whatever it is which makes this album great, there is no denying that is an essential album in anyone's collection.<br />If you have a DVD player with a good surround system, I highly recommend buying the DVD-Audio version.  This album is so clean and well recorded and marvelous, it deserves better than the CD format.
B000002JKA|3.0|The first record that i heard from Dream Theatre was '6 degrees of inner turbulence'. Although i had heard of them before, i pictured them as one of those guitar hero bands, with never ending, a hundred notes per second solos. <BR>I was obviously very wrong, and i was totally blown away by the great songwriting, diversity and musicianship present on their music.<BR>After that i got all of their albums, and this is the one that least impressed me. The only reason i see for so many fans considering this to be their favourite record is the fact that it was (until this year's release of 'Train of thought') their heaviest one. I respect that, but for me Dream Theatre are much more than a metal band. Personally, i think that 'Awake' is mostly uninspired. Sure there are great songs: 6.00, Voices, The Mirror, Silent man. But the bulk of the album is ponderous.<BR>The musicianship is fantastic of course, but the songwriting is not as good as on other albums.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Even thought I wasn't excited about the first single (Me Against The Music), this album turned out to be Britney's best yet. She has definatly matured in every way possible. Check it out!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I was at the concert, so when I saw the DVD, I had to order it.<BR> This is a really cool DVD. My personal favourite songs are Havana affair, which was from the ramones tribute album.<BR>I also like the way they left in bits like flea starting the Irish National anthem, and chad drumming along to Irish soccer chants, which i thought they'd edit out for an international market.<BR> Well worth buying if you're a red hot chilli peppers fan. The camera work is really cool. Especially the matrix style shot of anthony in the air, they have a few times.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is at her absolute best during this performance! If you are a Shania Fan this dvd is a MUST have!  You can bet, I will be at one of Shania's shows  as soon as she makes her way to my area again.  Shania is so energentic, and boy is she singing from the bottom of her heart and soul! You can really tell her love for her fans, by her interactions with them! Can you imagine if you were there at this show, not only did you see one brillient  performance, but you also ended up on her live DVD!
6301620208|4.0|The events leading up to and during the attack are cohesive and realistic and the acting is good.  After the bombs, it gets a bit weird (where did the horses come from???), and actually, is too OPTIMISTIC about what would happen.<BR>What most people forget is the right-wing hysteria (led by the usual lunatics like Pat Robertson) that centered around ABC airing this film.  The right-wing &quot;spin&quot; was the movie was made by the left so that we are in so much fear of nuclear war, that we never defend ourselves when (or if) the time comes.  Of course, for the typical ostrich-minded tunnel-vision people who think that why, you could NEVER present any scary vision if it disagrees with their way of thinking.<BR>Well, the movie aired, and was generally well received.  Luckily (at least for the time being), the threat of nuclear war is not high, but  of course, it has been replaced by piece-meal terrorism, which isn't so great, either.<BR>By the way, before the right-wing readers get in a snit, I am not a bleeding heart liberal.  I just believe in letting different views be heard (and seen).
B0000TB03W|5.0|Anyone who saw the TV special  only got a little piece of the show.The entire concert was a feast of high energy action as only Shania can provide. All 22 songs  had the crowd singing and dancing from the first note to the last.<BR>Shania has some fans singing along with her<BR>both from the crowd and onstage, and has an especially touching<BR>moment with a surprise proposal  by a fan to his girlfriend<BR>live on stage. No one who is even remotely a Shania fan should be without this dvd, whether you taped the show or not.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|&quot;If John was alive&quot;, he would quit all this cheap talk about McCartney attempting to re-write history and bla bla bla.<BR>John would be in favour of this because of several reasons even if he would find enough reason the fact that his soul mate and friend, Paul, was unhappy with this album production.<BR>&quot;If John was alive&quot; there would have been time to see Paul and John being real friends again, and who knows, working together again because that was, basically it. And , in fact, they were starting to become friends again when a mad guy shooted him. Who knows what it would have been ... but surely,  this thing of leaving McCartney as the bad of the movie, would not be let go on like some reviews pretend to.<BR>They were friends, they loved each other, and they fought like good friends do. But like good friends just giving some time they would have worked it out. And this confrontation of Lennon against McCartney and viceversa would have been a curiosity of the period from 70 to 73 including some lines in songs of albums like Let it be, Abbey Road, Imagine, Ram and Band on the Run.<BR>&quot;I don't beleive in ....................&quot; haters. Please listen to Revolution once again.<BR>Because over other things John was singing for LOVE and PEACE.  <BR>John would be the first one in defense of Paul and Paul would not have had the weight of having to justify himself over and over. &quot;Boy, you are going to carry that weight a long time&quot;.<BR>A great record, whatever the reasons and GET BACK is one of the best songs ever in the hystory of modern music.
B0000TB03W|5.0|The pyro techs are wonderful! Shania sounds Fabulous! The band is amazing as always! The crowd is so into every single song. Do you know someone who has never heard of Shania? Then this is the dvd to introduce them to her.
B00006SFBD|3.0|It was difficult to say if i give 3 or 4 stars. But if we think that 5 stars is ultimate masterpiece (like Opeth`s &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; -album) so 4 could be too much.<br />Record is good, but composing work is not so good than BW Park. Singing works ultimate good, also playing. Atmosphere is not so tight. Last 2 songs are best in this album. If u dont like progressive music, this is maybe little bit straighter than BWP and maybe easier to reach, but to me BWP is the BEST RECORD!<br />In this site problem is that people gave too easy 5 stars. Remember scale, 3 stars is still good :)
B0000TB03W|5.0|Incredible! Those who haven't picked it up...RUN. It's crisp, very close-up we see shots never seen before it delivers tons of energy.<BR>The tv special could not show all the energy and fun with all the commercial breaks the special on tv was great it doesn't compare to the dvd. <BR>If you've been to a Shania concert you know the woman doesn't stop the energy and vivaciousness for anything. This DVD captures Shania's breath-taking beauty and spirit and boundless energy.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I'm normally not a big fan of movie remakes.  In my experience Hollywood botches it good; especially when the first film was a smash hit.  That said, I went in expecting a mediocre film and got blown away.<br />The strength of this film is not only in the love energy between our star crossed lovers, but, additionally, in the humorous mix of contemporary music (i.e. Madonna's LIKE A VIRGIN; Sting's ROXANNE; THE LIFT IS UP WHERE WE BELONG (not sure if that's the title); IN THE NAME OF LOVE; etc).<br />Expect zany style humor with a great deal going off to the sides.  You will need to sometimes be a bit quick to pick up on everything, but, that's okay, because this is the new MOULIN ROUGE!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is a must for all Shania fans. If you are not a fan already you will be once you see this DVD. Shania is one classy lady. Shania rocks the stage. Every song is great. For a very entertaining evening, this DVD is a must for everyone.<BR>This concert was her best television special so far and the dvd is even better! Great deal for the money!
B0000B1OFL|3.0|The popcorn has finished popping, the couch is welcoming, the fun is ready to be had.<br />How could you NOT like \\"The Italian Job\\"? Once this movie crosses the finish line, you actually feel like you just regained that precious 105 minutes you lost watching...oh, hell, I don't know, \\"Maid in Manhattan\\".<br />Donald Sutherland plays a thief who, with his crew members (Mark Wahlberg, Seth Green, Mos Def, Jason Statham, and Ed Norton), heist $35 billion in gold bullion from a Mafia safe. They think they're all set until one of their crew members turns on them during the end of the getaway. Sutherland is killed and the turncoat crew member escapes with the gold, nearly killing his teammates in the process.<br />Flash forward, a year later. The turncoat is rich and Wahlberg has found him living in L.A.. Wahlberg assembles his original team to go after the turncoat, even enlisting the help of Sutherland's daughter who is a beautiful Mini-Cooper-driving safe-cracker(!). \\"It's not about the gold! It's about payback!\\", the movie boldly states although I wonder if there was no gold involved and it sunk with Charlie Croker's almost-doomed crew, whether they would go after the punk.<br />This movie is like that small box of chocolates you get from your other half instead of the large box. It goes down easy and doesn't make you feel like you've overeaten. As sleek as the Mini-Coopers that coast through the sewers of L.A., this is a summer action picture with the works. It's as techno-horny as the two \\"Mission: Impossible\\" films, though less serious and as fast and furious as...well...the Fast and the Furious and even Gone in 60 Seconds. Though, it's less goofy and with a slicker and smarter plotline.<br />A who-who's of young Hollywood talent is the main reason to see this movie. Mark Wahlberg plays Charlie, Ed Norton as the unpredictable Steve, Seth Green is the computer-hacking \\"Napster\\", Jason Statham is \\"Handsome Rob\\", the wheelman, Mos Def is surprisingly good as \\"Left Ear\\", the explosives man, and Charlize Theron rounds out the cast as Stella the Safecracker, the daughter of Donnie Sutherland's character, John Bridger (in a nice homage to the original Charlie Croker, played by Michael Caine in the 1969 film).<br />I almost would have preferred that this film could have been a remake/sequel in which Sutherland was playing the elder Croker and Theron was the next-generation Croker (The beginning of the film feels like the veteran is handing the ball to the rookie) but, alas, Mark Wahlberg takes the reins and the film works on its own as a fine \\"heist-the-loot-and-run\\" ride.<br />The script is witty and good fun. The good guys are smart, funny, and charming and have all the cool gadgets and you want to see the bad guy get his butt kicked in the end.<br />85 percent of this film is shot in L.A., California which begs the question, \\"Why is this called 'The Italian Job'?\\" However, such intricacies are easily overlooked when you watch the film and you could simply chalk it up to the fact that it's in tribute/reference to the first film.<br />This is the first film I have seen where, after it ended, I wanted to get in my car and drive anywhere at speeds exceeding 100 MPH without care that the cops might pull me over.<br />--Mattr\\", the explosives man, and Charlize Theron rounds out the cast as Stella the Safecracker, the daughter of Donnie Sutherland's character, John Bridger (in a nice homage to the original Charlie Croker, played by Michael Caine in the 1969 film). <br />I almost would have preferred that this film could have been a remake/sequel in which Sutherland was playing the elder Croker and Theron was the next-generation Croker (The beginning of the film feels like the veteran is handing the ball to the rookie) but, alas, Mark Wahlberg takes the reins and the film works on its own as a fine \\"heist-the-loot-and-run\\" ride.<br />The script is witty and good fun.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is the most impressive entertainer out there! This dvd will prove that to all who view it. The pyro tech's  are amazing <BR>Shania is definitely knows how to work a room. Years of practice from all the clubs she sang in growing up. There are 22 hits on this dvd. One incredible song after another. The perfect christmas gift for that special someone.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Quite an amazing show! Shania has enormous energy and it is thoughly desplaced here. There are plenty of crowd shots for those who attended this show you'll probably see yourself. he songs are fun and upbeat. They'll have you singing along. You'll be on your feet dancing along.
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica knows how to kick out the dope jams yo! With these funky-fresh lyrics all the hotties be like, WORD YO!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have been not been to any  Shania concerts yet but the Chicago concert makes me wish i could have attended this one.  Shania is SO full of energy, constantly moving, interacting with the crowd...it is fantasic to watch ! And the audience! Wow are they hyper or what?! Everyone on the dvd is  extremely excited to see Shania's first concert in the U.S. since 1999! The band is fabulous too! This concert just had so much energy and anyone that passes up this DVD doesn't know what they're missing!! And yes, there are extra songs that Shania performed at Chicago that were not shown on the TV special 6 of them!  So you're in for a real treat! I'm telling you, anyone would love this for a present and if there's no one to buy it for, then buy it for yourself because this is one awesome energy filled concert!Shania definitely rocks this country as will this dvd!!
B000002H33|5.0|Yo, dawg if you feelin' this shiznit check out P. DIDDY's latest yo!Its the bomb! If you like Wu-Tang Clan, buy this! Word Life.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I wish I could have been  at the taping of the show Shania puts on a fantastic show  It's the best! Shania loves her fans and it is a DVD that you will love and feel part of her show and her music.It is so good
B0000CDLA7|4.0|A lot of this has been said before, but I would tend to agree that I'm concerned for where DT is heading.  I enjoy the metal/angry/dark aspects of the CD, but the lyrics for most of the songs are not quite there.  The biggest problem for me is that the &quot;vocal experimenting,&quot; that some have praised this for, is heading in the direction of nu-metal rather than prog-metal.  Don't get me wrong, LaBrie still has a great voice, but it almost sounds like he's trying to hard to fit in a rappish style in some of the songs.
B0000TB03W|5.0|All I can say is WOW! I've never seen her perform live except during specials, such as the Super Bowl or her spring breaks a few years ago, but after watching the Up! in Chicago special, all I can say is this lady knows how to perform. Shania is the best and I believe this DVD proves that true.
B0000CDLA7|3.0|I was very disappointed upon listening to this album the first time and even more so the more I listen to it. Yes, the playing is as stellar as is to be expected which is why I gave this album a 3 star rating. However, this is certainly not what I expect out of a group with the talent level of Dream Theater. The song writing is rather poor and undeveloped and the lyrics are about worthless. This album accomplishes one thing: Anger. There are no textural layers or growth in the music. The lyrics don't take you on a journey, they just pontificate. There is no depth of emotion as with previous albums. Yes, the album is great for what it is...But it's not worthy of a Dream Theater title.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I've been  listening to Shaina Twain's CD for a number of years  and I think Shania is fantastic. Her signing voice is just awesome. I saw her Chicago Concert on TV and I know it was a good concert so I reserved one copy for my own viewing. Way to go Shania. Shania is  my favorite female singer of all time.  <BR> This DVD also contains her new video &quot;She's Not Just A Pretty Face&quot;. Which is taken right from the concert if you haven't seen it yet.
B0000019PA|5.0|Is this album the best of the past 10 years (or whatever people are saying) ?  Perhaps.<br />Basically there is a simple question here:  how much of a tolerance for surrealism do you have, and how much do you care about the technical quality of your music.  If your answers were \\"tons\\" and \\"not too much\\" then this is your album.  Jeff sings (off key, and in a nasal, primal-scream voice that will eather capture you, or move you to hit \\"stop\\" instantly) surrealistic lyrics about being a semi-homeless acid-addled southern indie rocker who inexplicably fell deeply in love with Anne Frank (yes, *that* Anne Frank) while they might never make literal sense, his lyrics have an organic, sexual, earnest quality that stands up to far more poetic scrutany than most songwriters these days.  The songs are suprisingly catchy and totally heartwrenching.  The playing is out of key.  You don't have to have perfect pitch to recognize that these songs use the same (minor) keys over and over and over again, and yet somehow it all works.  It's a concept album with no clear concept.  It's folk music for punk rock kids.  It's... it's... it's getting hard to explain.<br />Does it stand up to 4 years of obsessive listening?  Well not quite... I'm certainly not playing it every single day like I did in highschool, but it's still one of the best records I've ever heard.  It got me through the 11th grade, which is something to say, and it eventually led me to discover the blues and the crazy crazy sounds of pre-WWII American folk music (each and every fan of this record owes it to themselves to pick up Harry Smith's anthology, worth the $70 for the liner notes alone)<br />My only regret with this album is that I was actually in Athens while everything was going on, and I wasn't aware.  I discovered the band months after they (presumably) forever split up.<br />So yes, this is worth your money.  Buy it, put on headphones, curl up in your bedroom and try to make sense of it all.  It's beautiful and it will haunt you.  It doesn't really make sense in any traditional way, but those who get it never forget it.<br />I guess it's indie rock's Krazy Kat.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|wow oh wow oh wow! Singer has done it again! X2 was fantastic! Can we expect an X3? oh hell yes! more on wolverine's origin and can we expect a wolverine spinoff movie? oh hell hell ya!    Nightcrawler was superb, and the hints of Beast and Gambit, Singer knows what he is doing!    Stryker should have been more menacing, and the movie, less political (anti republican for instance)   Reason for 4 stars: Tired of watching humans up against the x-men, lets have Sentinles or hell, Onslaught or Apocalpyse. some one more menacing and stronger than a simple human, please Singer.    All in all, movie kicked major major ass and the surprise ending was great! singer really paid attention to detail in this super hero drama.    Wolverine kicked (and cut ) major major azz in this 2nd film. the rest of the cast was great too, especially the chemistry between patrick stewart and sir ian mckellen, purley shakespear!   muah! two thumbs up for this film! and who can forget the lovely lovely hott anna paquin, damn who does not agree that she looks damn damn hottt in leather!!! mmm mmmmmmm my love...
B0000DJZA5|2.0|According to the liner notes, \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" represents the album the Beatles intended to release. Perhaps this is why their original recordings gathered dust on the shelf and were not commercially released until the band had publicly disbanded. \\"Let It Be\\", most would agree, represents the nadir of the Beatles career in terms of songwriting and performance; even they themselves were so appalled with their work that they quickly reassembled and recorded \\"Abbey Road\\" which remains today as one of the finest recordings of all time.<BR>LIBN breaks no new ground; the unadorned recordings have long been available in bootleg form, and at just over 35 minutes running time it leaves the listener feeling short-changed. However, the digital technology has brought out nuances to the performances heretofore lost and, although the music is far below the Beatles' high standards, it is still better than 90% of today's popular music.

1400049628|4.0|I bought this book at a local bookstore. The guy behind the counter said this book was an &quot;excellent choice&quot;. He said the bouncer at the neighboring club bought the Zombie Survival Guide and the Anarchist Cookbook. The next day, the bouncer returned the Anarchist Cookbook, saying the Zombie Survival Guide was much more informative.<br />If you want to be as prepared as your local bouncer for the inevitable Class 4 zombie outbreak, I highly recommend the Zombie Survival Guide!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Nickelbacks new CD Long Road is Canadian talent at it's finest.  After listening to Silver Side Up, I was unsure if they would be able to reproduce that success?   Chad Kroeger and Nickelback have out done themselves again.  This CD is total energy!!!! Tunes to pay special attention to, Fellin' way to damn good, Figured you out, Saturday's nights alright for fighting(Elton John remake), Yanking out my heart, and of course Someday.  Nickelback doesn't need to have a gimmick to win fans, they do it with songs that everyday working folks can understand and relate to...Keep on rockin in the free world guys.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Very funny movie! Even funnier if you know some German because almost everything the Germans say in this movie sounds perfectly German - but it isn't.
B000002KIK|5.0|If you dont own this album, you dont know what you missing. This is a clear demonstration of Black Sabbath/Ozzie Osbourne's dynamic range. Range in thought and emotion, and range in talent. This album seems to fit any venu for me. I use this CD in my workout collection as well as background ambiance while relaxing. It has a kind of warm jukebox feel to it and at the same time, a psuedo Johnny-Socko orra about it! Which I think is really cool! I grew up with the ozzman (figuratively not literally - - - Oh I wish!), and this is good stuff!!! Get this album in your head as soon as possible!!!
B00005O438|5.0|Cujo was a great &quot;horror&quot; movie that seems to never lose its touch, much like other 80's horror films. It starts of as Cujo, the furry, lovable St. Bernard chases a rabbit down a hole and then there he gets bit by a rabid bat. But from then on, you just want to fast foward it to the good parts where Cujo starts killin', much like the book went when you might've scanned it, looking for the best parts. The movie wasn't lame, just a little moving as if you actually feel pity for that killer dog. And the DVD features no trailer. Of course when it was out on the big screens, no one wanted to think that Cujo was a dog. Its a great movie, serously. Just check it out and see for yourself.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Okay, let's all be honest. This LOOKS like the best film trilogy ever made, and it SOUNDS like the best film trilogy ever made, well, it must be! Even the Star Wars original trilogy (which is classic) has the sad connection with episodes 1 and 2.  Indiana Jones has episode 2, which took that trilogy out of the running, and the Jurassic Park movies...I need not say more. The LOTR trilogy is Peter Jackson's masterpiece and we thank you, Mr. Jackson, for these treasures!
B00008OWZC|5.0|wow, where do i get started. well if u like any classic rock cd this is a must have. i cant believe this only their second live album and by far the best. Trust me, Zeppelin is much better live than studio. if you want proof, check out Over the hills and far away, heartbreak, immagrant song, stairway to heaven and I could go on for the whole album. what im trying to say is buy this album, its well worth the money, u wont be dissapointed!
B00005JM02|5.0|After every Pixar movie, I think &quot;They can't beat this one&quot;. How can they possible produce another film better than F.Nemo? It's absolutely adorable and a true treasure. I find it ironic that &quot;real&quot; actors rarely connect with the audience like these fish do. Maybe Hollywood actors should learn from these fish! (example, I cared more about Nemo getting back with his Daddy than I ever did about Kate getting with Leopold back in his century!) The examples when real actors don't connect with the viewer are numerous. These fish did it, however!
B00005JMFR|5.0|I have a hard time understanding all the bashing of this movie that's been going on, especially by established reviewers. One guy complained that the movie sucked because Trinity didn't wear tight leather for long enough, an astute opinion I don't intend to comment much on. <BR>    Mainly, I guess I just don't see what's not to like. I can understand those who say that it lacks some the impact of the first one (the first movie is an unrepeatable success by its very novelty), even though I myself don't agree. But those who simply hate it, I'm afraid I don't get. A popular objection seems to be that it was nothing but a special effects bonanza with no substance, but that's not accurate. Granted, the special effects were outrageous, and even the most devoted fan would have to admit that the whole Zion battle took too much of the movie, but there is so much more here than just action. There is a war of ideals between Neo and Smith that even writers like Tolkien could hardly improve on. Many parts of the antagonism of these two characters reminded me of CS Lewis, a favorite author of mine, well known for putting deep philosophy in a compelling fictional setting. The rain-soaked duel in the climax contains dialogue and fighting reminiscent of classical titans in a final battle. <BR>   I would also venture that if you actually care about the characters, the movie is very emotional. Neo sacrifices himself for Zion, my friends. He is a Christ figure. It's hard not to be moved by that sort of sacrifice. Trinity's death scene, in which Reeves proves he's a very good actor despite Neo's deadpan persona, is another example of this theme. There is subtle but genuine character development all through the film: the glimpse we caught of Neo's real self, his *choices*, through the screens in the Architect's chamber in #2, is more realized here, when we see him lose everything. And if all that fails, there is still the single brilliant scene when Trinity sees the sun for the only timein her life. I'm a guy, and I have no problem admitting it almost brought tears to my eyes.<BR>   So if you didn't like the movie for whatever reason, you have a right to that opinion. But I'd like to request you give some respect: not only for those who may disagree with you, but also for the filmmakers, because it's possible they have really made a high-quality film, which just didn't happen to be to your taste.
0679428895|4.0|Young engineer Marcus Attilius is sent from Rome to wealthy and glamorous Pompeii to solve a pesky mystery: why has the aqueduct failed? It's his big chance to prove himself with the powers that be, and he's frustrated at every turn by heat, surly locals, and bureaucratic bungling and corruption. He can't even ask the former Aquarius of the Aqua Augusta for hints, because the man has simply disappeared without a trace.<br />We meet his main adversary, the rich and powerful former slave Ampliatus, just as he is throwing one of his own slaves to the moray eels. This poor man was charged with the care of red mullet in Ampliatus's fish farm, and the red mullets have all died. The slave's distraught mother enlists the help of Ampliatus's lovely daughter Corelia to spare the man. And Corelia, who hates her dissolute and cruel father, tracks down the new Aquarius to support the slave's charge that there is something wrong with the water.<br />Of course there is something wrong with the water: sulfur, although this information comes too late to save the unfortunate slave. And then there is no more water at all, at city after city up the coast. Attilius convinces the elderly Pliny to help him with ships and men, then get back to the spot where they have deduced the blockage must be.<br />Along the way Robert Harris spins a fast-paced mystery, and we learn much about life in Pompeii and the amazing engineering feat of the aqueduct itself. The decadence of the rich with their gorging and purging and young boyfriends is nicely counterbalanced against the practical, smart Attilius, who increasingly suspects an imminent disaster that is much bigger than a failure in the water supply. The impetuous young Corelia (who reminds Attilius of his beloved deceased wife) displays pluck and courage, spying on her scheming father and providing Attilius with information he needs to solve the puzzle. Human treachery and the forces of nature provide a spectacular finish.<br />Mr. Harris couldn't have chosen a more compelling period in a more compelling city than the four days leading up to the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 A.D. Anyone who has visited the fascinating ruins there will be intrigued by this very satisfying historical thriller.<br />   --- Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman-Nicol
B0000AXE8I|2.0|I first bought a DVD player years ago, right when the first Matrix film hit DVD. The Matrix DVD at the time set the standard for DVDs in the way of extras and quality. A real 5 star release. The DVD had a nice set of extras such as a feature on bullet time and a good commentary track. Sadly Reloaded is a huge step backwards from that wonderful first film's DVD. <br />The extras on Reloaded are minimal to say the least. There is no commentary track at all. I've heard that there will be a boxed set deluxe edition somewhere down the line for all 3 Matrix films and that is why there is almost nothing on this release. If that is the case then shame on the makers of this film for putting nothing on this disc simply to try and force us to buy all 3 films on DVD a second time. Yeah, LOTR did it as well to some extent but at least folks who bought the first release of those got some good extras included on the first release.
0345452577|5.0|The first Jonathan Kellerman book I ever read did not feature Alex Delaware. It was a novel titled THE BUTCHER'S THEATER, and though I read it almost 15 years ago, I can still remember passages of that book as if I had read them yesterday. I've read almost all of Kellerman's fiction since that time, including every Delaware novel, so I approached THE CONSPIRACY CLUB with some mixed feelings. I was slightly disappointed that this was not going to be another Delaware novel. But Kellerman's work, whether it involves Delaware or not, is so uniformly excellent that a deviation from his normal characterization would almost certainly be interesting.<br />Now, having spent a day or so reading THE CONSPIRACY CLUB, I can tell those of you who are diehard Delaware fans that, if you skip this excellent novel because Alex Delaware is not in it, you are cheating yourself. And if you're not already a fan of Kellerman, THE CONSPIRACY CLUB is the key to becoming one. Notwithstanding my familiarity with Kellerman's work, I felt as if I was discovering a debut novel by a new author who had studied at the feet of the masters and was channeling them.<br />The book is excellent in every way. The characters are unforgettable, the dialogue is witty when it should be and dark when appropriate. The plotting is so intelligent yet straightforward that you'll walk away from this great novel feeling smarter than you did when you first picked it up.<br />THE CONSPIRACY CLUB introduces Dr. Jeremy Carrier, a young staff psychologist at City Central Hospital in an unnamed Midwest city. Carrier is carrying around a boatload of grief since his passionate but all-too brief affair with a nurse named Jocelyn Banks was abruptly ended by her kidnapping and brutal murder. Carrier was initially a suspect in Banks's unsolved slaying, and Detective Bob Doresh has a disconcerting habit of popping into the hospital at odd times to ask Carrier off-kilter questions, just to let Carrier know that he's still under the magnifying glass. When another woman is murdered in an eerily and similarly grisly fashion, Doresh seems to be taking more than a polite interest in Carrier, a circumstance that creates even more sorrow and confusion for him. This is counterbalanced --- barely --- by Carrier's slowly developing relationship with Angela Rios, a hospital resident whose slow but sure emotional succor seems to put him on the road to recovery.<br />At the same time, an elderly, somewhat eccentric physician named Dr. Arthur Chess begins to take a gently incessant interest in Carrier. This interest culminates with Chess inviting Carrier to a mysterious late night formal supper. Chess and the other four guests, all individuals of wildly disparate backgrounds, treat Carrier well. He cannot help but feel, however, that he is there more to be observed and evaluated than anything else.<br />Almost simultaneously Carrier begins to receive a mysterious series of seemingly unconnected articles and messages through the hospital mailing system, correspondences that seem to be aiming him toward the identity of the true murderer of Banks and the other women. Kellerman, already a master of the suspense novel, takes the genre to new places here. Carrier is an empathetic psychologist, a master at sharing emotion with his patients, but he is not a detective. He lurches, in fits and starts, toward the true identity of the murderer, who is set to strike someone close to Carrier once again.<br />Carrier is a highly believable character. He is capable of giving comfort to his patients, even to those who seem unreachable, but is slow to accept and receive such comfort himself. Kellerman's account of Carrier's initial encounters with Rios is absolutely first-rate. What is even more remarkable, however, is Kellerman's ability to infuse his novels, and particularly this one, with realistic minor characters, who sometimes enter and exit within the space of a single page. One such character is a woman whom Carrier encounters while she is sweeping out a vacated bookstore in a building that is scheduled for demolition. The dialogue between the two characters goes on but for a few sentences, yet the woman's portrayal, primarily conveyed through her comments regarding her own behavior, is perfect. A character like this is not the stuff of literature so much as she is the essence of life. Even if her actions make no logical sense to her, the reader understands them immediately.<br />Carrier certainly has the potential to be an ongoing, sustaining character. He is too good a character to limit to one novel, even one as fine as THE CONSPIRACY CLUB.<br />  --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlauber encounters while she is sweeping out a vacated bookstore in a building that is scheduled for demolition.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Lots of people have written and made comments about let it be naked. For all of you who have said that it was wrong of Paul to redo the album, I say shut up! This is a Beatle album. Who cares if Paul decided to remove some of the material that had been on the first release, or if some of those old tracks had not come from the let it be sessions? None of that matters. We still have the original let it be album to listen to. Paul did not come into our homes and take that first release away from us, he just gave us a new Version. If the Beatles had listened to all of the opinions that were being voiced when they were making the music, we wouldn't have the original and exceptional material that they gave us. It was their ability to think out of the box and their willingness to take a chance on the unknown that made them special. Let the artists make the art! If you don't like it, don't buy it, case closed. The Beatles rock!<br />John
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I love The Beatles 1. It's a great album. I'm 19 years old and have had the opportunity a lot in my life to hear The Beatles. I was excited the day I bought this a couple of years ago and am proud to own it.<br />The Beatles 1 is exactly what it says. It's all the songs that number one for them over the years. The songs are taken off the English and United Kingdom charts. A lot of the latter songs are songs that went number one in the U.K. Hardcore Fab Four fans will recognize every song though.<br />I like the early tracks better than a lof of the latter tracks. The early ones are there bigger hits that more people will recognize from the early 60's. A lot of fans will argue that the bands best work isn't on the cd and I agree with them to a point. If you want there greatest works get the greatest hit albums. The Beatles 1 is just straight number one hits.<br />This album has sold over 22 million copies worldwide. That statement alone enough shows the kind of album this is. EMI is making a ton of money off it. All Beatles fans should be happy to have this in thier collection. I'm sure glad it's in mine.
0451191153|1.0|This book is unnecessarily long.  It is only a little interesting.  No one really claims that this is great literature, but the following are claims that generally praise the book:<br />1.  It is inspiring<br />2.  It is philosophically admireable<br />Claim 1 is subjective and possibly true for some.  But claim 2 is just plain mistaken.  Rand's novels are at most some type of applied philosophy in fictional form.  At worst they are repeated batterings of a wild worldview.  Anyway I can't recommend spending money on this.  Afterall, there are tons of legitimate philosophical works out there, and most self-help books are probably more effective than this for motivating.  But don't take my word for it.  If you're still compelled to read this then go for it.  Maybe you'll like it for some unique reason.
B00000DLV1|5.0|Despite what everybody says about &quot;Dummy&quot;, Roseland Live is their best album. This recording takes some of the best tracks from Dummy and the self-titled LP...and the hollow-ish echo-chamber quality of Portishead's studio albums unexpectedly comes alive. The first track begins slowly (what orchestras call an &quot;overture&quot;) and builds to the thump-thump-thump of the live drums which immediately gets you hooked. Astonishing album. Portishead remains detached and trip-hoppy as usual, but the live drums, real orchestra, and Gibbons' wails pretty much put this album in the pantheon of post-mod classics. The &quot;Roads&quot; track recorded in Norway is too beautiful.<br />Caveat to the Portishead novice: listen to their studio albums first. The Live album is better as a compliment to the studios, not the other way around.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|In my opinion 95% of Bruce's music is essential. Debating what was excluded is fruitless with only 2 discs of previously released tracks. The songs are timeless and the 3rd disc is now available for our enjoyment. This disc obviously enticed the die-hards such as myself &amp; not the novice fan. Thank you Bruce! NOW PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS BRUCE, REMASTER ALL THE ORIGINAL CDS. GREETINGS THRU TUNNEL. Something is not right when UNRELEASED material such as the Tracks box set has pristine sound &amp; all the true cd releases have way below average sound. Please rectify this crimnally neglected catalog w/updated sound. Just a suggestion that I'm sure is shared by many people.(And maybe more bonus tracks on the upgrades)
6305508550|5.0|I'm not sure it is essential to have worked in an office to enjoy this film, but I'm certain it will hit home for those who have.  The movie was a complete bust at the box office, which utterly mystifies me, because it is hysterically funny and reflects the experience of millions of people across the United States (and I assume elsewhere).  In an age where companies are seeking to lay off workers at any possible opportunity, this film has perhaps even more relevance now than it did when it came out in 1999.<br />The humor of the film works on multiple levels, but for me so much of it is funny with a twist of the knife, for much of the humor hints at a much more serious fact:  modern work is genuinely dreadful and alienating.  Perhaps many office workers love their job, but I hate mine, and I assume that I am merely one of millions.  No one in this film has a meaningful job.  Even Lumbergh, though the boss, has an absurd position.  Peter Gibbons is at least able to be honest about the ridiculousness of his plight during the incredibly funny sequence in which he is hypnotized.<br />The film is a collection of many, many wonderful moments.  I started laughing from the second that Peter Gibbons gets trapped in the traffic jam and is passed by an old man on a walker, and didn't stop until the very end.  The film is a parade of very funny bits, from Michael Bolton and his passion for gangsta rap to Joanna's boss urging her to wear more flair (played by director Mike Judge) to Peter's neighbor who would yell at him through the walls to Peter's bizarre fantasy in which Lumbergh is making love to Joanna holding a cup of coffee in one hand and her ankle in the other to virtually any conversation involving Lumbergh and Milton.  Some of the humor is a bit too broad.  For instance, although I defy anyone not to find Milton's sequences funny as heck, they don't fit in quite as neatly with the satire of the rest of the film.  I wouldn't, however, want to trade them in for a tighter movie.<br />In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.  Now I know it is.  But somehow knowing the truth makes it easier to get through the day.r movie.<br />In a way, this movie has made my life easier to live.  I suspected my job was absurd before seeing this film.

B000001FN3|1.0|This album proves that parson can run a 2 inch tape machine, but the songs themselves fall a little short. I was suprised to see all the great reviews, but I have other ideas. First off, the songs are maybe a little too obvious for my tastes, and possibly dehydrated sounding. The second song is passable, and so is the last (raven, one in paradise) but the rest is just annoying to me. Not very much direction, or inspiring melody. Tracks 6-10 are really boring, and I have a TON of patience for good music (22 minute Yes songs). But it just seems like they are wandering around, trying to sound like &quot;real&quot; artists. And the vocals arent recorded very well, but the drums have a very clear ring to them. Now whoever said arthur brown should sing on this album has a few problems! Terrible awful voice. The funny thing is I love Eve with a passion, yet that album gets such bad reviews. If you want a) better production, b) better singers(!!), c) better SONGS go with Eve. A very wonderful hint of jazz. I think they matured by 79
0385504209|1.0|I tried to like this book; gave the author the benefit of the doubt all the way through, but at the end I was so disappointed. What a waste of paper! The characters were mediocre, the plot line drolled on and on, and the conclusion was anticlimatic with just plain silliness. It is obvious that this author has been scorned by the church, and this nonsensical and disconnected book is his revenge. I mean really, the French all upset about some kind of religious sex act? Like they even care about strange religious tendencies. As far as the Jesus/Mary line, just because the author wishes it to be true, doesn't make it so. Attacking religious traditions is so tired and transparent. This author preaches to the disgruntled choir to make a buck.

B00005JMFO|5.0|I thought this movie was a wonderful movie and was very heart-warming.  The opening introduction, with the many people greeting each other in the airport was very touching.
0385504209|4.0|Yes folks, it's only FICTION.  And it is good fiction, though I don't call it great fiction.  Certainly, Dan Brown has an active imagination, and the first half of the book is explosive and compelling to read.  But the adventure aspect of it gets a little old in the second half of the story, and I thought it ended in a wimper.<br />When it comes to the theology aspects of the story, I prefer to side with the Apostle Paul's version of Christ, over Leonardo DaVinci (assuming Dan Brown is accurately characterizing DaVinci and others).
0393317552|3.0|The author is preoccupied by political correctness and cultural relativism and his politics intrude -- and ultimately undermine -- on what is otherwise an really interesting and insightful work.<br />But if you read the book or even a few reviews, you already know that.  So here's my contribution: what his book is really about is chaos/complexity theory although I don't think the author appreciates that.  Complex systems are extraordinarily sensitive to initial conditions and the development of modern civiliation is a complex system.  A few extra grain species in Iraq and presto, 5000 years later you end up with New York and London. The irony is that there's nothing deterministic about a complex system. It's totally unpredictable. The idea of determinism that prevades the book is an illusion of history viewed through hindsight.
B000099T2L|5.0|I was a little apprehensive about buying Beyonce's album because of quite a few negative comments I read, but I just bought her CD like 2 days ago, and I am in love with this CD. She did a great job for it to be her debut solo album. She has a lot of great songs on this CD, but my favorite is &quot;Me, Myself, and I,&quot; but trust me, there are plenty more great songs on the CD. I recommend everyone to go out and buy this CD--you won't be disappointed. And to anyone who thinks otherwise about this CD, stop hatin. You did ya thing, B!!!!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|the title is horrible, the cover is ugly, the booklet is boring (save for the essay), and the 2nd disc is a complete joke considering the wealth of material that exists (10 second song clips- how generous.)  I suppose \\"true\\" Beatles fans would disagree, but then, to them, a bonus of 20 minutes of the Beatles farting would have sufficed.  What a rip-off.  No wonder people file-share.  <BR>By the way, the blurb behind the tray is the equivalent of a slap in the face considering what we were given here. Merry Christmas!

B000002UD0|4.0|Would John Lennon have been a star based on his solo material, without his history as a Beatle? Unlikely. As a rock 'n' roll singer I don't think anyone comes close to John (except perhaps his longtime Beatle writing partner Paul, and Little Richard), but that opinion is based on his work with the Beatles. He always said he liked rock 'n' roll and not much else, but his solo albums show very little of that passion. &quot;What You Got&quot; is the hardest rocking track of his solo career (and the thing I like most about it is that he doesn't seem to suffering at all about the 'lost love' described in the song.) This is John's last solo effort --- and perhaps his first. He was separated from Yoko at the time and could finally have his own say in what he recorded. &quot;Going Down On Love&quot;, &quot;Dream #9&quot; and &quot;What You Got&quot; are highlights, but all of the songs are more revealing than anything else he had recorded before. Much of his solo career seemed to be divided between apologizing to Yoko and trying to be relevant as a social commentator. On &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot; he breaks that mold and seems to really speak from the heart. The production is hopelessly trapped in the 1970's and the worst track &quot;Bless You&quot; is dreary and should be confined to Lounge Lizard Hell, but that's a minor point. The happiest track is &quot;Surprise Surprise (Sweet Bird of Paradox)&quot; that he wrote about his love for girlfriend May Pang, and the most interesting track &quot;Steel and Glass&quot; is his attack on himself and former Beatle manager Alan Klein that musically mirrors his ungenerous attack on Paul McCartney in the earlier &quot;How Do You Sleep&quot;. &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot;, like all John Lennon's solo albums, is interesting because of his Beatle past, but it best shows what was on his mind without some of the baggage he seemed to have to lug around in earlier efforts.
B00005JLH2|1.0|This movie had no plot what so ever. Just another mindless teen movie full of \\"popular\\" hip hop garbage. This is the kind of movie that seems to come off an assembly line, making people actually lose IQ points. If you want an intelligent teen movie get Breakfast Club. Or even the mindless American Wedding is better than this.<br />On another note I have now been acused of \\"hating\\" because of this review. This is simply not the case. I liked a different movie that was kind of similar to this(only better), called Finding Forester. I also quite enjoy many African American musicians. And on a movie note I have given many movies with mostly white casts bad reviews such as; Charlie's Angels, The Fast an the Furious, Mission Possible 2, The Hulk, ETC. <BR>So don't try and blame the poorness on this movie on \\"hate\\" that doesn't exist.  For all you know I myself could be African American.
B000089RW0|1.0|By now, anyone with even a passing interest in thrillers-horror films knows he/she HAS to see the opening sequence of &quot;Ghost ship&quot;. Too bad there isnt a special DVD release containing ONLY that sequence because the rest of this flick is extremely forgettable.<BR>   &quot;Ghost ship&quot; has a great setting (..alarmingly haunted and abandoned ship) and it could have been overall great had that premise been used adequately in better hands: notably, a scriptwriter and a director. But instead it sinks before it ever leaves the harbor.<BR>   The attempted story goes very summarily like this: an abandoned cruiser re-appears about 40 years and a crew of salvagers set off to retrieve the gold rumoured to be on it only to discover that the ship holds a deadly and haunting secret within it. <BR>   Like i said above, this all sounds well and good if not very promising but only on paper. Because, what goes on on the screen is a grand cinematic failure.<BR>   Aside of the opening scene where the entirety of the passengers are slashed into oblivion with one big swift cut, &quot;Ghost ship&quot; is ridden with bad acting, cheap thrills and even cheaper scares which might scare a teenager at best, and a story so full of holes it would make swiss cheese look terribly compact.  <BR>    The biggest mystery in this film is why an actor of the caliber of Gabriel Byrne agreed to play in this disaster.<BR>    Buy the film poster but avoid the film at all costs.
B0000C1HLF|1.0|This movie isn't even worth seeing hot chicks running around. It has no point, no story, the acting is worse than a soap opera's acting, and the dialogue is so bad Ed Wood Jr. couldn't even of dreamed of writing it.<br />Maybe Roger Ebert was a little quick in naming The Brown Bunny as the worst movie ever?

B00006F7S4|5.0|I always enjoyed Mellow Gold &amp; Odelay but didn't buy any more Beck albums as I just assumed it would be more of the same quirky musical hybrids which he perfected on the latter album. <BR>I got hold of Sea Change as there isn't a lot of good new stuff out there and figured if its Beck it has to be better than most of the dross that passes for alternative music these days. Which it is! Beck has changed his sound quite a lot and the results are enjoyable. It does require a lot of patience and work from the listener though particularly in the middle of the album where it goes into a floaty meandering with what sounds like an orchestra (or it could just be a synth). The production is good though sometimes it pushes Beck's awesome acoustic guitar playing and voice into the background with all the electronic pops and hisses but for the most part it works well. Beck was obviously quite depressed when he wrote this though it's more soul searching than soul destroying. Easily one of the best albums I have heard in the last couple of years.
B00005JLKB|3.0|After heard so much hype about the show, I get myself a copy of the series. Though I like the show very much , but was dismay to find out the DVDs collection didn't offer any much extras. WB should at least throw in some MTVs especially the theme song Save Me by Remy Zero. Or at least they can remaster the sound to 5.1 surround. There's so much more can be done to enhance the series or improve it like why don't we get the deleted scenes in the actual show instead of showing it as a special feature ! Most people getting a DVD just to see more extras and not just 2 or 3 deleted scenes shown as a special features !Guess for the second season I'll be buying a pirated copy instead as I'll save hundreds from this.
0195067142|5.0|I have read many combat veterans accounts of battle.  This book is the most compelling so far.  Sledge has a way of telling a calm and sane story that could never be calm nor sane. The fact that this was written by a frontline Marine is what makes it so unique. This is a great book for anyone but especially someone interested in becoming a Marine.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This excellent album is all the best things Josh Groban provided in his previous album plus exciting new material and style. His talent is boldly performed through favorites like: Caruso and Mi Mancherai. Instrument accompaniment adds texture and beauty in each song, with Mi Mancherai excelling the greatest, with the violin solos. Josh Groban shows steady growth and new style. The album is wonderful to have for home entertain and also a great gift for the holidays.
0312305060|5.0|I'd tried Virginia Woolf several times, but bogged down (I'm not alone in this, I suspect).  Then the film, &quot;The Hours&quot;, moved me to try again . . . I have just finished reading (in this order) Mrs. Dalloway and Michael Cunningham's &quot;The Hours.&quot;<br />DO YOURSELF THIS FAVOR!  You'll become acutely aware of the skilful interweaving of themes . . . Clarissa and the other characters take on deeper facets . . . details that may have tired you, or slipped by, in Woolf will take on new shape and meaning.<br />And above all, the language . . . I'm not going to go into plot, characterization, symbolism, etc. -- When you're dealing with a classic, such things are readily available, and I'm not a scholar of English literature.<br />Suffice to say, I have come from this reading experience feeling refreshed and renewed -- and enormously impressed.

0060930187|4.0|This book is a work of art.  Plath's poetic skill comes shining through in this novel about a young woman suffering from severe depression and suicidal ideation.  Plath's use of words to convey images, feelings, thoughts and personality is precise.  The story flows beautifully, as she tells the story of Esther Greenwood.<br />Esther's fall into depression reveals in depth insights into the malady that come from Plath's own experiences.  This brings up an issue when reading this book.  It is difficult to separate the character and the novel from the author and her own life and tragic ending.  That consistently loomed in the back of my mind as I read about E. Greenwood.<br />I enjoyed reading this, but also had to put it down at times because of the depressing nature of the story.  Plath puts the reader into the thoughts and consciousness of a depressed young woman, and that is not an uplifting experience.  I don't think this is the type of novel you just read for pleasure w/o becoming involved with the character.  Plath wants to make sure you know what it is like to be a depressed person thinking about suicide.<br />It has an optimistic ending that allows you to leave Esther Greenwood to take on the world again and to trust that she will do OK, even though the author fell victim to the depression that haunted her.

B0000TB05A|5.0|I live in Des moines, IOWA which is pretty far away from NY and LA and i am only 16 which gives me no chance of seeing U2 live, and for them to release this dvd, its just like i was there. i was singing, dancing, jumping up and down just as the crowds were. the audience at slane castle was so amazing, even the fans in the way back. this dvd is just more evidence of how u2 have touched our hearts and changed the face of music.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I randomly picked up this CD and fell in love with it. The lyrics are simplistic and yet hard hitting at the same time. The musical score of each song is awesome. It's nice to find a cd that I can actually listen through and enjoy each song. Gavin sings about such relatable subjects, and you find yourself &amp;quot;dedicating&amp;quot; each song to someone you know in your life. I hope that the general public realizes what an amazing cd this is.. I'd love to see this guy go far!
B0000E1WNV|2.0|I think this goes without saying to the audience writing these reviews-Bruce and the E Street Band are the greatest live performers in rock n'roll history. Their off performances are far greater than most artists I've seen in 25 plus years.<br />The point here should be the quality of the product released. As some others have said, it's not necessarily the song selection(though there are redundancies that could've been changed). I've had some slight disappointments in some of Bruce and company's song selection in the past, but one thing I've never had a problem with ever is the sound quality on his recordings. Live in NYC's sound quality is so far superior than this it's not comparable.<br />And the reason is, I believe, is Bruce wasn't at the controls on this project! <br />I can't believe that Bruce or Jon Landau would approve the release of this DVD without first listening to it. But that's exactly what it seems like. The Bruce I know from the past would not have done that. <br />If I were Bruce or in charge at Sony, I would recall every one of these no matter what the cost and start over. If I wanted inferior sound, I can just dust off some my old Bruce bootlegs. Bruce, you are much greater an artist than to compromise that.

Several songs that were meant for DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN and THE RIVER, as well as &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down&quot;, &quot;Janey Don't You Lose Heart&quot;, and a live &quot;Rendezvous&quot;, are clearly among his best. If you get this and the TRACKS boxed set after BORN TO RUN, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, THE RIVER, THE RISING, LIVE IN NYC, THE WILD, THE INNOCENT, &amp; THE E STREET SHUFFLE, THE ESSENTIAL BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, LIVE 1975-1985, and BORN IN THE USA, you will have a great library of prime Springsteen.
0689815816|5.0|This is one book both my 3 1/2 year old and 2 year old can agree on.  It is a staple every night, and we all squeal and pull the covers over our heads at the end right along with the characters in the book.  This book has inspired my toddlers to go on their own \\"bear hunts\\" all over the house with flashlights and the lights out.  So much fun from one little book!!
B0000E1ALR|5.0|THE ESSENTIAL BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN contains some, but definitely not all, of Bruce Springsteen's best songs. In addition to two discs of greatest hits, it contains a third disc of previously unreleased songs. This is a great anthology, but it's wiser to get the original albums.
0385512104|5.0|Wonderful reading experience. Unlike any other book that I have ever read (probably the closest is &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;) At the beginning of the book, Christopher, the fifteen year old narrator states that &quot;This is a murder mystery&quot;, and he is going to be detective, investigating who killed his neighbor's poodle, Wellington. While he is trying to solve the mystery he uncovers many other secrets about his family. Haddon's use of pictures, charts, and graphs really help the reader understand and see through the eyes of Christopher, who has Asperger's disorder or autism (it is never clearly stated). The reader really sympathizes with Christopher's parents and all of the idiosyncracies he has: He hates the colors yellow and brown and will not eat any food that color, or wear any clothes with them; he has a fear of people touching him, and often screams when someone lightly brushes him. There are many other instances in the book where the reader sees that Christopher does love his parents, but he cannot show them because he does not know how to express emotions.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to admit, I was having my doubts about this new record from Britney.  The last album was good, but you could tell she was hitting a dry spell.  She did the right thing by taking some time off, and getting some new producers and writers.  &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; are all standouts here.  Britney's voice is getting a lot better.  She still needs work, but I think she has what it takes to stay around awhile if she takes a few hints from her mentor and idol, Madonna.  Stay fresh, Britney!  Keep changing your sound from time to time...and the pop world will remain your domain! :)
B000002Q7Y|3.0|Power is by far Kansas's weakest record, but it is also one they should be praised for.<BR>Well, for starters,the departure of Kerry Livgren,the genuis composer and progressive inspiration behind the band, did leave a clear void.Yet more importantly,it was also clear that in order for the band to survive in the 80s,it had to alter its style to accomodate the pressures from industry and the dwindling interest in the genre that made their name since the early seventies.(Jethro Tull did succumb to these pressures and went all new wavey in Under Wraps and the earlier Livgren led Kansas of the period,minus Walsh-Vinyl Confessions and Drastic Meaures-was not immune from it).<BR>Gone in Power are the complex epic compositions that were the trademark of Livgren (even in the relatively more commercial Vinyl Confessions, he stuck to his  style and melodies with Crossfire,a masterpiece of melodic progressive rock).In,are more popish melodic rock songs, with the ubiquitious cheesy ballad, that sounds more like something Reo Speedwagon or Journey would write,and one song in particular,Secret Service,that sounds very much like Eloy's Nightriders from Metromania.<BR>But to be fair, all credit should go to the returning Steve Walsh,for keeping the Kansas name alive in that period. Many progressive bands have just called it a day in the 80s, and Kansas without Livgren could have easily followed suit,but Steve Walsh opted for a slight change in style in order to survive,(thankfully only temporarily for he proved with Freaks of Nature that his love for quality progressive rock music was very much alive and kicking).<BR>What is most interesting about Power is the joining of Steve Morse, one of the finest guitarists in the industry (maybe not a good subsitute for Livgren's song writing abilities, but nonetheless an excellent musician in his own right, clearly audible in the instrumental Musicatto, a Dixie Dregs influenced virtuosity).And of course Phil Ehart, one of the best drummers inrock, is as always excellent.<BR>As a big Kansas fan I ended up buying the record anyway despite my disappointment,only to complete my collection.It is not the Kansas sound I love(hence my three stars),but then again for its time it is by all means a brave release from truly talented artists.
B0000DZEA1|4.0|Ok..I think that this is a very GREAT piece of work.  There are definitely elements from the other two soundtracks, but at the same time, it has a life of its own.  The music from the trailer is on this CD, not as pronounced as the movie trailer, but it is there on Track 3.  I cannot wait to buy the limited edition.  This is definitely a good buy and the very last song &quot;Into the West&quot; is beautifully sung my Ms. Annie Lennox...it stirs emotion and the words are beautiful.
0783231032|5.0|The public response to 1941 is the epitome of examples in how differently people see movies, yet it is also a prime example of how viewers tend to agree with the vast majority. My response to those who are members of the latter...think for yourselves! Just because the critics and your friends hated it does not mean you will, too!<br />1941 is without a doubt the definitive cult film, loved and hated by millions...more of the latter, unfortunately. But for those who love it, they truly do LOVE! Like Spielberg himself says in the documentary &quot;It's a small, twisted crowd that appreciates '1941'.&quot; I'm proud to be a part of that core group as I am able to notice, understand and appreciate the jokes director Spielberg, producer John Milius and writers Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale spewed forth into this film while I'm now living such a disgustingly politically-correct environment like our own.<br />Racist? Hardly...merely a pie in the face of the Statue of Liberty (as Speilberg calls it) and a Stooges poke in the eye to the American social environment of the 40's. Funny? Absolutely! Who can't laugh at Eddie Deezen, Murray Hamilton and the dummy on the runaway ferris wheel? Who can't laugh at Ned Beatty blowing up his own house with a anti-tank mortar? And who can't appreciate and simply gawk at what is still some of the greatest miniature effects ever put onto film?? A.D. Flowers was a genius in this department!<br />My advice to those naysayers is this...free your minds of the contemporary P.C. clutter poisoning our world these days for 2-1/2 hours and watch this painfully UNDERRATED movie once again. You'll be surprised as to how much more you'll appreciate it. Even Spielberg himself loves it again!
B00005UKKF|1.0|I borrowed this DVD to check out the performance (because I already knew she CAN'T sing) and it was a huge disappointment, I was expecting at least good choreographies and a good show, since she never sings, but what I saw was soooooo sad, I've seen her performances on MTV and her videos and those were really well prepared and very well organized (with some great choreographies), but this presentation in Vegas was too sad, the outfits were horrible too, but that doesn't surprise me she always dresses really bad (despite all the money she has). Finally, the sound is VERY GOOD, BUT the tracks that were used on the concert were the same tracks from her album, so if you want to hear her songs then buy the CD, don't spend more money on the DVD is not worth it, at least they should have made a good mix for the concert, not putting the same tracks for her to lipsync.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is probably my favorite book of all time.  It's one of those remarkable books that manages to tie together the qualities that matter most to me.  The plot is full of twists, the writing can't be beat, and the characters are incredibly believable.  The rabbits are not so fictitious that they carry around swords and walk upright, but nor are they the boring, fluffy creatures one might imagine.  They have a whole culture of their own, which includes Lord Frith (the sun) and a whole language called lapine (What? You thought rabbits were stupid?  Silly you).  <BR>      The story starts with Fiver, a small rabbit with special kind of gift, who warns them that they must escape, because some great evil is coming.  He only convinces a few, and they set out, wandering and vulnerable, onto a course that includes fear, hate, and tenderness.  They meet some pretty twisted rabbits (which give ME the chills), and plenty of elil (enemies).  One of the funniest points is when they're finally settled, happy on a hillside after days of traveliing unprotected, and they realize there aren't any females.  Obviously this is another problem that leads them into yet more adventurous acts.   <BR>      While this book is wonderful, I've found that it's extremely difficult to convince someone to read a book, when you are forced to begin, &quot;It's about rabbits...&quot;.  After the first sentence, they become uninterested. <BR>      No really, listen!  It's a GOOD book about rabbits...
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|It's nice when a band can actually produce a second album that is better than their first. Suck me off, please.
B000002ITW|4.0|No one's going to get an argument from me if they say that there are several moments on here that could've been dispensed with. Steve Stills entire &quot;49 Bye-Byes/America's Children&quot; noise rant sounded stupid back then and still does (and I LIKE Stills!)and the &quot;electric&quot; portion of this set never quite catches fire. But with the exception of Still's solo moment, the entire first disc is a winner. Crosby's &quot;Lee Shore&quot; remain's captivating after all this time and the addition of Stills' &quot;Black Queen&quot; to this release gains back some of the ground Stills lost with &quot;49 Bye-Byes.&quot; Neil Young's contributions remain the strongest here, both in his solo sections and when the four team up on the Buffalo Springfield-era &quot;On The Way Home.&quot; The addition of Nash's &quot;King Midas In Reverse&quot; serves as a good reminder that Nash is not always the lightweight he appears--the version here is a winner.<br />This is not a great live album, but it has its moments and that's enough.
B000093BDX|4.0|in my world, anyhoo...this is a really good collection, especially for the uninitiated, but... maaannn! These 6 addt'l. songs would of made this a true 'best of' classic:<BR>-\\"I DO LOVE YOU\\"<BR>-\\"TIL I DIE\\"<BR>-\\"SAIL ON SAILOR\\" (why is this great song overlooked so often?)<br />the last 3 SHOULD OF BEEN ON THIS COLLECTION:<br />-\\"WENDY\\"  ?<BR>-\\"409\\" ?? <BR>-\\"CATCH A WAVE\\" ?<br />See what I mean?

B00000D9TQ|5.0|This is a very good compilation of his solo efforts. I like different aspects of Collins during his Genesis and his solo work. For the latter, I sometimes enjoy the full albums better. However, for pop music compilations, this may be the only one you need.
B00004BZ16|5.0|After the smashing breakthrough, the sophomore review and the roots  recognition, this great band didn't have a damn thing to prove. So they went into the studio and followed their passion wherever it led, with no regard to audience or critic alike.  They even couldn't be bothered with editing the dozens of tracks they came up with down to even a respectable 2 disc exile/white album.<br />Uneven?  The funny thing is that on different plays you might change your mind as to what is essential and what is filler.  But for God's sake, don't get hung up on consistency.  You can skip around on your CD player now, or even burn the &quot;perfect&quot; one disc collection if you want.  <br />The point is that some of the greatest moments of rock lie in this set, and if you let anybody scare you away because &quot;it's too messy&quot;, well, you won't know what you are missing.  (That said, if you are phobic to left of center politics, you may wish to avoid boiling yourself to a rage.)
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Critics have been guarded in their reviews of the new Strokes CD \\"Room On Fire\\".  No one wants to come right out and slag the band that has been touted as the \\"next big thing\\" in rock for the past couple years, but no one wants to give this disc high marks either, since it sounds like little more than a sequel to 2001's \\"Is This It?\\"<br />Is this a bad thing?  Heck, AC/DC has made a long storied career out of it, so why can't people cut the Strokes a little slack for doing it two albums in a row?  And it isn't entirely a retread.  The intentionally cheesy, retro synthesizer on \\"12:51\\" and \\"The End Has No End\\" definitely adds something new (or old, depending on your perspective) to the mix.  And let's call a spade a spade here - for all the praise heaped upon them, the Strokes are more or less a retro band.  At various times over the course of their two albums, they sound like Tom Petty, U2, the Cure, the Smiths, the Ramones, and the Replacements.  Is this a criticism?  No way.  <br />In my mind, any band in this day and age that dares to write (1) actual SONGS that (2) do not borrow from other people's material and (3) have some true MELODY to them and does not consist of the most raw and annoying power chords and screaming imaginable - this band immediately gets my respect.  And if their second album sounds a lot like their first, that's fine.  You don't buy a six-pack of your favorite beer and expect it to taste any different from the last one, do you?  <br />Bottom line - if you liked the Strokes' first CD and don't like to see the formula tampered with, you'll like this one.  If you're someone who demands that your favorite bands constantly evolve and progress, well, maybe next time.
B0000C3I6U|3.0|Extras on the DVD version of &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; mostly play like promos for the film and its star, Arnold Schwarzenegger, but there is an odd and compelling new element.<br />In &quot;Iron Insights,&quot; Gov. Schwarzenegger sits alone for the camera, reeling off a 13-minute monologue about what he did and didn't do during the making of the hit 1977 &quot;docudrama&quot; about a body-building competition.<br />&quot;Now it is important for people to know what is real&quot; in the film, Schwarzenegger intones, not elaborating on the urgency. &quot;Certain things were not true.&quot;<br />Schwarzenegger smoothly revisits the film's hot spots, notably marijuana use, his psychological pummeling of guileless rival Lou Ferrigno, and the scene in which he casually blows off his father's funeral in favor of training for the Mr. Olympia competition. Then there's that messy bit comparing orgasms and pumping iron.<br />&quot;Pumping Iron: The 25th Anniversary Special Edition&quot; mostly reprises the film-and-featurettes package that ran on Cinemax a few years back. Video (4:3) and audio (5.1 or stereo) were remastered at the time, with decent results considering the source materials.<br />The movie doesn't retain the shock value it did back in the mid-'70s, when body sculpting was just an odd subculture. But it's still an interesting time capsule. And Arnold's love affair with the camera gives a good indication of what's ahead. (Sorry, no groping.)<br />In the extras, Live Schreiber gives terse, NFL films-style narration to a 15-minute intro and a making-of docu, both strengthened by outtakes plucked from the 100 or so hours shot by director George Butler (&quot;The Endurance&quot;).<br /> The featured bodybuilders reunite and talk about what the film meant to them, both good and bad. Ferrigno, in particular, struggled to come to terms with his image in the film: &quot;I felt like a freak.&quot;<br />PS -- This DVD is no quickie -- it was planned well before Schwarzenegger's guberatorial campaign.egger's guberatorial campaign.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|That's just the bonus of being a male fan....Spears rips it...again. You feel the whole album.

She does it again with a great third album.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|An attack on the President of United States by a mysterious Mutant heightens the tensions between Mutants and Humans and prompts the authorization of an assault on Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters. The President gives a secretive former military man named William Stryker (Brian Cox) unprecedented power in detaining and questioning Mutants. Unbeknownst to the President, Stryker has acquired vital information from the imprisoned Magneto (Ian McKellan) regarding Cerebro, which Stryker plans to use to carry out his own agenda against all Mutants. Storm (Halle Berry), Wolverine (Hugh Jackson), Cyclops (James Marsden), Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Nightcrawler (Alan Cumming), Rogue (Anna Paquin), and the students find themselves on the same side as Magneto and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) as they race to foil Stryker's plan.<br /><br />&#34;X2: X-Men United&#34; is the second film based on the &#34;X-Men&#34; Marvel Comic. Whereas the first film spent a lot of time introducing the characters, this one introduces only three new characters: Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Iceman (Shawn Ashmore) and Nightcrawler, and those introductions are well-integrated in the plot. The first film's coherence suffered considerably from all the backstories. But &#34;X2: X-Men United&#34; is able to concentrate its energies on plot with improved results. The story makes more sense and is much more satisfying than the first film. Both films suffer from having too many characters, which sometimes seem to be like so many gadgets, each with its own gimmick. But I think we're stuck with that problem. Director Bryan Singer has done a good job. &#34;X2&#34; is a lot of fun. It may not be as socio-politically complex as the comic books, but it does manage to raise issues of abuse of power, constitutional protections, minority rights, and the politics of fear, if only briefly. The public is told by their leaders and by the media to fear Mutants, and so the public is inclined to look the other way when their rights are violated and they are flagrantly persecuted. Entertaining and recommended, but if the cast gets any bigger, they will need to wear name tags.when their rights are violated and they are flagrantly persecuted.

0790731452|5.0|Ensemble comedy is just plain difficult to pull off.  This is particularly true when most of the characters are self-centered and vapid, lending little emotional support for the poor viewer to hang onto.  Mars Attacks! proved too user unfriendly to garner much enthusiasm on its release.<br />But after further review, the ruling on the field is reversed.  Tim Burton has put together a just about perfect homage to his beloved cheesey sci-fi roots.  The film just requires lowering pre-concieved notions and more attention to detail.  As H Ross said &quot;The devil's in the details.&quot; and truely, the humor here is diabolical.  (This begins with just trying to get the darn thing to play.  It seems like the little martians are determined to torment right from the start, which is actually quite funny once you realize you're being messed with a little.)<br />While it may have been fathered 100 years ago by H G Wells, and certainly styled from latent boomerism, the film actually might seem more relevant now than when first released.  (We've seen some of these characters in the news the past couple of years.)  Some things happen to age very well.<br />So go ahead and throw this thing into the new home theatre, or slap it into the Powerbook with a pair of headphones, and try to figure out why it looks so much better now than when you first saw it.  There's something to be said for late boomers.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie is a total mess. There really isn't very much good to say about it. It's loud, It's silly and the story is terrible. To sum it up this movie is a complete waste of time.
B00005JMFO|5.0|Love actually is the best movie ever made! Its hilarious, and occasionally touching.  It should be played every christmas...or even, better every week!!

B00009V8Z9|5.0|After seeing Gavin perform I had to purchase the CD.  If I could describe it in one word I would have to say &quot;Captivating&quot;.  He writes his own lyrics and conveys his amazing heart and soul when he sings.  Songs about love and heartache, the trials we go through in life.  He really relates to us through his music.  And for the record, he is just as sweet in person as you would imagine or want him to be.  <BR>Sincerely,<BR>Christy Lauderdale
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I am very disappointed that there have been many people writing bad reviews when they don't understand or feel the real jist of Let It Be Naked.  Many of rhe UK writers as well as many of the US writers are all thinking alike as well.  The Beatles are giving you (1) a choice, (2) their history and (3) great music when there's nothing to listen to these days.  That's why greatest hits and best of collections are selling well.  Why? Because, and I'm only 38, there is so much [junk] these days that we all have been suffocated with Eminem, Josh Grobin, Cleine Dion and Britney.  Why do you think the Rolling Stones and The Who are still out there (....as well as what's left of the Beatles).  To bloody save us.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|I went to see this movie on a whim after I saw the first one which was a good flick but not like over the top fantastic.<br />The Sequel is AWESOME! Great Cast (The same with a couple new ones),Awesome Special Affects,and last but not least a really really good Storyline.<br />This is the type of movie you can go enjoy for the action and the excitement yet still follow a complex yet very interesting story.<br />I really recommend it to anyone :D <br />PS - It was 100 times better than Matrix 2 or Matrix 3 for that matter.
B000002A46|5.0|When Mariah Carey released this cd back in 1994, no one at that time could have imagined the classic it is today. Critics blasted Mariah, claiming that she was showing off and no one would be able to feel the Christmas spirit. But she proved them wrong. Almost 10 years later, everyone from Shania Twain to Luther Vandross have performed her Christmas classic &quot;All I Want For Christmas Is You&quot;. On this cd, Mariah does 60s pop, R&amp;B, gospel, opera, and both fun and serious songs. She even write three songs, including the touching &quot;Jesus, Born On This Day&quot;. Don't miss out on this cd. Also , I must add this cd is ALOT better than Whitney's Christmas cd.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Looking at the box, you think it's soft porn. Watch the first few minutes, and you think it's a thriller. After 45 minutes or so, you think you're watching some French psychosexual drama. Then the end of the movie comes, and you find out you've been watching a really good chick flick! Underneath the spicy perversion is a straight-up made-for-each-other love story, and a really good one. <br />The heart of this movie is a truly incredible performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose shy, crooked smiles come off like a deeply repressed Meg Ryan. She is absolutely stunning in this role. The script and directing are merely okay, but she carves a perfect shining jewel of a performance out of a solid rock of material. Her mere presence in any future films will make me take notice! If she starts getting heavier roles, she could turn into another Meryl Streep - her performance reminded me in many ways of Sophie's Choice, despite the much milder source material. <br />James Spader performs his typecast repressed pervert role (Sex Lies and Videotape, Crash) with his normal mumbling flair. It's not that he's a bad actor, it's just that Maggie Gyllenhaal is so much better. He does his part to move the film along and provide the appropriate friction for her to form a character against. Jeremy Davies and Lesley Ann Warren do well as representatives of the life Lee needs to escape. <br />Anyway... if you want a good, dopey love story and aren't afraid of a LOT of kink, and want to see an up-and-coming actress before she starts getting Oscars (she absolutely deserved an Oscar nomination for this role), watch it. But if the idea that sadomasochism can be a form of love for the repressed offends you or freaks you out, go rent something with Meg Ryan instead.

B00007M5CO|4.0|My first contact with this music was watching Mariano &quot;Cicho&quot; Frumboli and Eugenia dancing to &quot;Bruma&quot; at a tango festival, and I was just fascinated.<BR>The potential in mixing tango with new sounds is   overwhelming. So I bought the CD - and was a little bit disappointed. <BR>The only track that is &quot;alive&quot;, is actually &quot;Bruma&quot;, the rest is more or less (quite nice) trip-hop/house music with some tango samples that never taps the full potential of this fascinating mix.<BR>Anyhow - I would buy the CD again. Get it, listen to &quot;Bruma&quot; and hope with me that there will be more music like this one.<BR>Note for Tango-DJ's: Unfortunately most tracks are not <BR>danceable for the dancer at a milonga.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nirvanas third album,4th if you count insecticide, is pure unadulterated genius. Head and shoulders above the highly touted Nevermind, In Utero takes the pain and anguish Cobain unleashed in the pop glazed Nevermind and strips it down into raw, real passion. In Utero is not the pop album that Nevermind was, in fact the darkness that is displayed on every single track on this album is comparable to Alice In Chains &quot;Dirt&quot; release. Cobain is a genius, delivering hook after brilliant hook, and lacing every song with the most angst ridden lyrics that, other than Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell, no artist has been able to deliver since. This album is on par with any &quot;classic&quot; (Led Zeppelin II, Toys in the Attic, Dirt, Dark Side of the Moon, Master of Puppets, etc.) delivering brilliant song after brilliant song. Many people complain about the raw production that Steve Albini gave this album, but in fact its what makes many of these songs work. Take a listen to Milk It, or Dumb and you will see what I mean. It gives the album a trademark sound and gives Cobains voice the rawness and realness that it actually has. Many people knock this album at first because its not the pop laced soundtrack that Nevermind was. Ill admit I was one of those people, but after actually sitting down and listening to In Utero hard, I now rate it as my #1 favorite album of all time by any band or performer. If you dont have this album and you are real about being a music fan this is a must have for anyone. The best album of the 90's along with Nevermind, Dirt, and Superunknown. In fact in my opinion, this is the best album of all time.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I have been a staunched fan eversince but even so I couldnt help but notice the big difference in her voice now. Her voice used to be crystal clear and soaring, which was still evident from the last 2 tracks in the cd that were previously recorded. She has lost the magic albeit the styles are still present. <BR>They shouldnt have added the last 2 tracks as they have become a source of comparison between Whitney Then and Whitney Now.<BR>Having said that, I want my old Whitney back...
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!<BR>ROTK is dripping with emotion and you can tell from the tone that this is the finale of the saga.  Many of the compositions really sound like they are resolving the story as opposed to the thunderous battle music that largely made up the Two Towers score.<BR>I love the ROTK score just as much as the first two.  Howard Shore has really done well at making each score a separate, unique piece yet still maintaining thematic joiners across the trilogy.<BR>Now how long for the ultimate CD set of the entire trilogy extended music scores (with the ENTIRE score from each movie)?
6305882592|5.0|This is one of the finest films ever made, period. Forget fancy special effects... just a wild idea, fantastica acting, incredible emotional range, the blackest humor, and the endless twists and turns of two hearts finding each other, when there is no one else just plain weird enough for them. <br />I need to buy a copy of this film. For my children. If i owe them anything as a parent and mentor, it is to expose them to such good reasons to live. <br />My favorite scene, without spoilers?  When Harold gives Maude the locket, and what she does with it, and why. That one minute of film has more emotional resonance than most sugar-coated schlock could ever hope for.

0060920084|1.0|I enjoy travel, mainly for the opportunity it gives me to add to my own travelogue.  I was tipped off to Bill Bryson by another Amazon member and sought out this book because it was closest to my own interest.  I was assured that it would be witty and revealing.<br />The only thing it reveals is that Bryson has no wit.<br />He searches for America's small towns (What an original idea for a traveler!), only to become disappointed in every single small town he visits.  The entire book is one scathing review of small town America after another.  His caricatures of small town citizens are insulting.  There's nothing quaint about his observations.  That Bryson can call himself a traveler may be the only amusing thing about the book.  The man shows no joy for the process in any chapter at all.  He takes a few stabs at Jimmy Swaggart (Never heard THAT before!) and movie theaters in some attempt to paint himself as Jean Shepherd.<br />He recalls feeling uncomfortable as a long-haired hippie draft dodger visiting Mississippi on the way to a beach vacation in Florida during the Veitnam war.  Apparently, the way the people sitting in one diner stared at him forever left him with the impression that the South is full of inbred homicidal maniacs.  Looking at his picture on the back cover and trying to imagine that face on a long-haired hippie teenager, I'd be forced to side with the Mississippi freaks.<br />The liner notes also reveal that he spent two decades living in England.  From what I can tell, this was not nearly enough time.  I emplore the man to return to London where his criticisms of true Americana may be more fashionable.<br />I propose that his time across the pond has left him completely out of touch with life in rural America.  He admits to feeling uncomfortable around blacks, snobbish around whites and generally disheartened that things didn't remain a sterile, Ward Cleaver environment in his absence.<br />And throughout his journey, what is the one thing he discovers that makes it all worthwhile?  Des Moines - his hometown.  It might have been a touching revelation if this guy didn't come across as such a jerk and the Des Moines gimmick didn't come off as such a ....gimmick.<br />This one goes into the garage sale.

B0000E1WKE|1.0|I was one of the long-time fans who based on Whitney's history of great albums (with the exception of the awful &quot;I'm Your Baby Tonight&quot;) purchased last years dimsal flop &quot;Just Whitney&quot; and quickly returned it to the store as I was horrified by the way Whitney's vocals had been destroyed by a well-documented addiction to drugs. It has been 12 months and things have not improved. I thought I would give her one more chance but I find myself equally dissapointed.<br />The cover featuring a photo of Whitney looking like she is once again on some wonderful crack chistmas vacation, lounging on a bed with a huge grin and stripper-like dead eyes did not instantly appeal to me but again for me, she had one more chance.<br />I've already returned the album to the store and dug out Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas (wisely recorded years before Mariah's voice turned to a whisper) <br />The single &quot;One Wish&quot; is a mess and Whitney's vocals on the track and the album are almost unrecognisable - deep and hoarse and often straining over unnecessary ad-libs that destroy the classics. In fact &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; is downright awful.<br />The album reeks of contract filler especially with the addition of the tracks from the much-forgotten soundtrack to The Preachers Wife (possibley Denzel's most embarrassing moment). With her recent track record of flop albums, being dropped by awards shows, all night parties and strange behaviour in prime time interviews my &quot;one wish&quot; is for Whitney to wake up to herself and start to sing again otherwise she may just be dropped by her record company - afterall they did it with Mariah.<br />You want Whitney at her best? Pick up &quot;The Bodygaurd&quot; soundtrack and the beautiful &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;<br />This is not an album you can listen to at Christmas dinner.
0440237688|5.0|Louis Lowry's The Giver is such a classic literary piece that i hardly find it fitting to write a review for it.  This book is so thought provoking and magnificent that one you read it you will love it.  I'm not sure what else to say about it, for if you havent already read it you are for sure missing out on a book that WILL make you think and let me say that it is a book that, although comprehinsive to younger people and teens, anyone, anyage will be able to read THe GIver without feeling like they're reading a book that belongs to their child.  Amazing book, you will love it.
0345452577|4.0|Six months may have passed since Jocelyn Banks was brutally murdered, but her lover Dr. Jeremy Carrier remains despondent as he knows first hand that time does not heal all wounds.  Though the police remain convinced he is the prime suspect, a depressed Jeremy buries himself in his work as a psychiatrist at City Central Hospital because being alone is more difficult to cope with than working with emotionally crippled patients.<br />However his antisocial misanthropic behavior is interrupted when colleague Dr. Arthur Chase hooks Jeremy to attend some social functions of a secret society. As Jeremy begins to come out of his emotional fog, he notices that other women have recently died in the same gruesome manner as his beloved.  Clues begin appearing for no apparent reason.  Realizing he must act alone as the police seem to be closing in on him as the serial killer, Jeremy begins investigating a cat and mouse terror game with someone guiding him, but is that someone the killer?<br />More a combination conspiracy amateur sleuth tale than a medical thriller, Jonathan Kellerman's latest tale is an exciting story that hooks the audience the moment Dr. Chase breaks down the first of Jeremy's survival barriers.  From that moment the story line is fast-paced filled with red herrings as everyone seems garbed in a masquerade (though not the same type of plot, this reviewer kept thinking of the List of Adrian Messenger).  The \\"conspiracy\\" seems a bit odd and off kilter, but fans will value this exhilarating look at vengeance.<br />Harriet Klausner
B0000DD7LB|3.0|gee whiz. i heard so much good stuff about this CD, which hyped me up even more to get it. so i rushed to get it, and i'm excited to listen to it right.. i was kinda disappointed. you know when you usually go through each song first after listening to a minute of each. i didn't really like any except the last track. toxic is probably one of the best ones, and i think i played that out already. it kinda gave me a headache. i received more of a headache after listening to the rest of the songs thereafter. oh well. britney is pretty
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is great.  I bought the theatrical version of the dvd when it came out a while ago, but this one just blows it out of the water.  This version adds a lot to the overall story and plot of the Two Towers(it has 40+ minutes of added story).  Having read the book, I was slightly disappointed with the first release(it was still great), but this release includes quite a bit of stuff they left out.  For those of you who haven't read the book, the added stuff should immensely help you understand what is going on.<br />As for the extras, they are great.  I have watched one disc of the extra's and still have one more to watch.  These extra's are a lot of fun to watch because you get to see how they do the special effects(the one about gollum is very interesting), what they changed, and what the actors thought.<br />Overall, this movie is a great buy.  The new 40+ minutes is great and you will hardly notice that it is longer. Also, the extra's are great.  This is a dvd you will want in your collection.
B000003TAB|5.0|Nirvana's b-sides/outtakes compilation Incesticide offers great insight into the sudden leap between the sludgy Bleach and the powerful melodicism of Nevermind. While the band may have released this because they were caught off guard by their sudden fame, all of the songs fit together so well you'd swear you were listening to an actual album. <br />It's easy to see the transition from Bleach to Nevermind throughout. The first two songs, \\"Dive\\" and \\"Sliver,\\" were originally released together as a single in the summer of 1990. In fact, the \\"Dive/Sliver\\" single was a huge turning point for Nirvana because it paved the way for the sound of Nevermind. Also recorded in late 1990 are the songs \\"Turnaround,\\" \\"Molly's Lips,\\" and \\"Son of a Gun,\\" which were recorded for the John Peel session in October of that year (the whole session is featured on the brilliant Hoarmoaning EP, which I have also reviewed here), and are, in fact, covers of Devo and the Vaselines, respectively. \\"Stain\\" sounds like a more melodic version of a Bleach track, and is truly one of Nirvana's best songs. \\"Been a Son,\\" \\"Aneurysm,\\" and \\"(New Wave)Polly\\" were all recorded at a BBC session AFTER Nevermind, in the fall of '91. These are probably the best studio renditions of these songs imaginable, despite the fact that they were live favorites for quite some time before. The punk version of \\"Polly\\" just plain rocks, and offers a completely new look at an already familiar song.<br />The second half of the album is mostly outtakes from the Bleach recording sessions. \\"Beeswax\\" and \\"Hairspray Queen\\" are awesome because they show Kurt trying to do different things with his voice. At some points in these two songs, his shrieking reminds me a bit of Black Francis, which is a compliment. \\"Downer\\" and \\"Mexican Seafood\\" are short, but sweet (I love the melody of \\"Seafood\\"). \\"Big Long Now\\" is slow and seductive during the verses, but soars high during the chorus. This is one of Kurt's best uses of the \\"soft verse-loudchorus-soft verse\\" structure that he was known for. \\"Aero Zeppelin\\" is a tribute to the band's influences in the early days. I don't care much for this particular song, but hey, it's one out of fifteen. In fact, I think the band's outtakes from the Bleach sessions were a lot better than some of the tracks that were put on the album.<br />Do not be turned off by the fact that this an outtakes collection. Actually, many of the songs are some of the best that Nirvana ever did, and I would argue that this album represents their sound better than any of their other releases. As great an album as Nevermind was, its production was a bit too clean. Bleach was a bit inconsistent, and In Utero had a harsh and abrasive sound. The recordings found on Incesticide sound like a perfect bridge between Bleach and Nevermind, and for this reason, this is probably my favorite Nirvana release. With all the hype Nevermind's had, it's easy to see how this got overlooked, but that doesn't mean that you should. This is Nirvana at their most honest, raw, and effortless. Absolutely essential.

0321200683|1.0|This book is a messaging technology book (as the small print states.)  Thus, it's all about using messaging systems for &quot;enterprise integration&quot; and does not go deeply into other tech such as Web services and transactions.  You should know that before you plunk down the bucks for this hard back.  Also understand that we're talking about technology that is over a dozen years old, nothing really new here.<br />The title should be &quot;Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions,&quot; minus the &quot;Enterprise Integration Patterns.&quot;  Would have saved me some money, I hope you don't make the same mistake.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|Alright, I'll admit it, this is not your typical Dream theater Album, but it has alot to offer. This is Dream Theater's tribute to metal, and maybe riffs may be recongizable from other metal bands like metallica. But this is not the first time that they have &quot;barrowed.&quot; if you listen to &quot;Once in a Livetime&quot; they have so many jam sessions branching off into other songs by bands that have influenced them, some of them not even metal, ie Syknard's &quot;free Bird.&quot; Anyways, this album will be a ball-buster thrasher at concerts, and it will kick alot of ass. They havn't had anything this hard since Awake with The Mirror. &quot;This Dying Soul.&quot; has some strong lyrics, and is linked to &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, and I hear there is more to come. &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot; has great aggression coupled with that Vulnerability factor that has become popular through bands like Tool. Musically I think the best song is &quot;In the Name of God&quot; they have some orginial sounds and riffs in this 14 minute epic, and the lyrics are questioning and challenging. Just listen to the lyrics and give the riffs a chance. Metallica hasn't been able to provide us with a good metal album, so Dream Theater stepped up to the plate.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is a living example of the words of the song Shes Not Just Another Pretty Face which is one of the best songs in the collection on the DVD. She has faced many difficult times her life and she stood up to all of them and progressed to her goal of making music. Ths is a great thing for us without her this DVD would never have come about. The joy and love she puts forth and her being so full of life shows how much she loves the fans. She is the most talented women preformer now and this DVD highlights that.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Amazing that anyone could possibly think that this is their best work yet. DT spent very little time on this and it shows. Many of DT's efforts are hard to describe because they were so original and well refined. How many people here have said 'it sounds like Metallica' or 'it sounds like early....'. That's the point. There's nothing new or creative with this effort. I agree with a couple of the comments about 'Honor Thy Father'. Might as well listen to some mindless, boring, monotonous rap. 2 stars for their talent, 0 for creativity.

B000002H72|5.0|Through the misty clouds of hair spray that was eighties rock came something of a breakthrough. This hard hitting, soft crying record broke in half then quartered the idea of an album. A seemingly schizophrenic vision of the world through the eyes of a vocally bi-polar front man(Black Francis). A scene of guitar bridges and collapsing structure. This is a rollercoaster of an album, and in no way will you regret having taken the ride. From the very first song you know exactly what you THINK is going to happen, then, you're blindsided once, then again, and still again. It's incredible to hear something so timeless. I got this album not too long ago, for I was too young to have really enjoyed it in 1989, but from the moment it began I knew it was an astounding achievement of sonic perfection. With every chorus a rise, and every bridge a fall; from every soft and subtle verse to every hard and loud and wonderful chorus this album sings. It sings of driving into the sea, it sings of old westerns, and it sings sometimes just for the sake of screaming poetry through clenched teeth. Seldom is there an album where the screaming and discord come together so naturally, fuseing into a hybrid too perfect to give words. <br />The only advice I could give to the shopper of this wonderful acheivement in music is simply buy the album out of faith that it's something irrevocable; because every bit of the world that is now was in this album from fourteen years ago.<br />Peace and pleasant listening.
B0000C7PQK|1.0|This album is such dissatisfaction to me... I love Enigma, I rush to buy Enigma, 5th album is the last one?
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's DVD is one that a person cannot say enough about. The whole show is full of energy, love, joy and a great list of songs. When Shania returned with such power I did not realize she was so good. The complete power of her voice in the songs cannot help but move you inside. It contacts with you emotionally. It touches you deep inside. She is a super star with a down home flair. You cannot go wrong with this DVD. It is just to good to overlook.
B0000TB03W|4.0|This is a great dvd to add to your dvd collection... not to mention that this is Shania Twain herself. The dvd is packed with great performances from all of her hits. She sings her... tail off and you see her hard work everywhere throughout the whole concert. You have to get this dvd!
B000003TA4|1.0|The death of real music. I made better music when I took a crap this morning.
B0000AM6LY|4.0|This newest release from Mick Hucknall and Co. is a nice reaffirmation of thier talents with solid, catchy songwriting, good hooks and a nice selection of varied material (&quot;Fake&quot;, &quot;Positively 4th St.&quot;) and gets instant cool points for the brilliantly deployed Hall and Oates sample on the smash &quot;Sunrise&quot;, which, in my opinion, should be the Number 1 song in the country right now. Yeah, that's right, I said it! &quot;Sunrise&quot; is catchy, brisk and an easy sing-along with enough soul to please enough the toughest critic. I hope it's a massive hit for the band.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I'm Listening to the album now and I'm up to track number 3, what the hell are all these other reveiwers hearing. For God sake, this is exactly what Dream Theater Fans want and expect. Fast YES. Metal YES. Rythmic YES. Dark,YES. Stageringly complicated YES. Soulfull YES. Get your hands off it. This is just as good as any other album they've put out. If I reach only one Dream Theater fan out there who's been scared off by all these negative reveiws I'll be pleased. Just buy it you can't go wrong.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania comes to life on stage even through she states she prefers to be at home out of the public eye. This DVD and the songs on it proves she loves to entertain and be there for the fans with only the best music. Her band and her songs were the best. Shanin has put her life in her music. She understands and has lived many things so now she can put it into her music and the way she sings the songs.
B0000TB03W|4.0|She is so great in this DVD. I love each performance and I am so happy to have bought this DVD. It is well worth it. I would recommend it to anyone!
078322933X|4.0|When you see a movie edited on tv and you say \\"I have got to own this movie!\\" then you know that it is really good. I was afraid to commit to it since it seemed like a CRUSH rip-off and I didn't want it to outstand my beloved favorite movie. It didn't. But, it's still a creepy little thriller about obsession, love and murder. <br />Meet Nicole Walker. A 16 year old girl with sex on her mind. Her father just married a woman and has a new stepbrother. Her girlfriend Margo Masse and her friend Gary decide one day, to be late for school and to go get some food at a gritty coffee shop. Nicole glances at David but doesn't really meet him until a party later that night. When the party becomes a riot, Nicole escapes with David to sit around and talk. It's love at first sight. <br />One night, Nicole tells David that she's ready to have sex. He says he's with some friends and has to do something. She tells him it's alright and to come over after and she tells him the code to the front door. Well, David comes in and they have sex. A day later or so, David goes to Nicole's school to pick her up, he see's Gary hug her. Not good in David's eyes. He goes over and beats the crap out of Gary and in the process, hits Nicole in the face, giving her a black eye. <br />Nicole's father is more than pissed. David seems to give him the creeps. When he confronts David, David says \\"You know, Mr. Walker-you really aren't a f***ot.\\" Mr. Walker tells David to stay away from Nicole. After Mr. Walker leaves, David starts hitting himself in the chest. He tells Nicole that her father hit him. So she runs off with David, feeling sorry for him. He asks her if she wants to go to a party when he brings her back to her house. She tells him no. But after a few seconds, when he leaves, she decides to drive over herself. She goes there, and looks in a window to see Margo being abused and about to be raped by her \\"true love\\" David. <br />She now discovers David's true dark side. She won't talk to him so he\\"attacks\\" her in a bathroom at the mall. Mr. Walker's red car gets smashed up with a note on the broken window saying \\"Now I've poped both your ........!\\"....Mr. Walker finds out where David and his gang lives and ruins the place. When the group finds the place in ruins, David knows exactly who it is. And by their law \\"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a ...... tooth\\" they decide to pay the Walker family a little visit... <br />What worked in this movie was the psychotic attitude of David. He's a soid good actor and a damn good liar. You know he's bad but you really like him. He seems perfect. You try to like him after his accidently hitting Nicole but it becomes harder and harder. <br />RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF: <BR>Fatal Attraction (1987) <BR>The Crush (1993) <BR>The Stepfather (1987) <br />CAST <BR>Mark Wahlberg...........David McCall <BR>Reese Witherspoon....Nicole Walker <BR>William L. Petersen.....Steve Walker <BR>Amy Brenneman..........Laura Walker <BR>Alyssa Milano..............Margo Masse <br />THE MOVIE: 3/4 <br />THE PICTURE QUALITY: 10/10 Anamorphic Widescreen 2.35:1 with only a very very very small amount of grain. Basically, perfect. <br />THE AUDIO QUALITY: 10/10 5.1 surround is perfect for my TV's sound system. No upping the volume for me! There is also a Dolby Surround French track. <br />THE SPECIAL FEATURES: Production notes on the film, cast & crew bios and film credits (Only pre-FEAR movies are shown), a trailer with a lot of grain and Universal Weblinks (basically pointless). <br />SUBTITLES: English and spanish.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is definately my favorite soundtrack out of all the ones that I own. All the songs are great and are perfect for the movie. My favorite songs from the soundtrack are: &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot;, &quot;Too Lost In You&quot;, &quot;I'll See It Through&quot;, and &quot;Christmas Is All Around&quot;. If you loved this movie, you will most DEFINATELY love this soundtrack!!! :)

B0000BWVCM|5.0|This had to be the best summer film of the year! Everything (story, acting, direction,effects, etc) were in top form! I particularly love the scenes with Magneto &amp; Mystique...they really camp it up &amp; have a blast. Jackman continues to shine as Wolverine, haven been given a better role this go around that explores not only his rage, but also his snarky funny side. The ending was marvelous &amp; I can't wait to see what transpires with Dr. Jean Grey.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Please buy this DVD. I know I did and I have not regret it since. Shania sings so well and she covers most of her best hits. Up is definitely one of my favorite DVDs right now. It is a good buy for anyone!
B00005QATY|5.0|Well, if a movie can be made to perfection, this would be it.  This movie was recommended to me by my Pastor.  As a born-again Christian I would naturally shy away from a movie that uses the Lord's name in vain, but as my Pastor explained it's just a vehicle to make fun of a \\"Christian\\" culture that has the language without the transforming power of the Spirit.  I really don't get to watch many films because I just don't trust Hollywood, but this picture seems different to me.  While making fun of the Southern \\"Christian\\" culture, it seems to say that there is a reality behind the fake.  The movie is full of gospel tunes and great music.  The acting is funny to the nth degree.  The dialogue is funny, funny, funny.  I would give this movie 10 stars if I could.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Since it seems that every reviewer here on Amazon is either raving about DT's new 'metallic' turn or whining about their departure from their 'melodic' roots, I figured I would atttempt to present a somewhat unbiased and neutral point of view. First and foremost, the point is this: Dream Theater is a PROGRESSIVE metal band, implying that every record they put out should (and does)sound different from the previous one. It seems to me that some DT 'fans' always seem to have something to complain about- Falling Into Infinity was too 'commercial', Six Degrees was too 'Broadway' and now Train of Thought is too 'metal'. Well here's a news flash- not every DT album is going to sound like Images &amp; Words, and if it did, then DT would be no different from every other band recycling the same old crap with each new album. Simply put, DT would not be DT. <BR>That said the question remains- is DT going metal a good or bad thing? Well the answer of course depends on what you want from your music. If you want excellent musicianship, songwriting, tempo changes AND kick-ass METAL then this is definitely the album of the year- especially when compared to St. Anger (dont even get me started on how much THAT sucked...)If, however all you want is smooth, dreamy melodic prog rock along the lines of Another Day, Surrounded, Take Away My Pain and The Spirit Carries On, then give this record a skip (and stop calling yourself a prog metal fan while you're at it). <BR>I wouldnt go so far as to call this my favorite DT album (that distinction goes to Images &amp; Words, following which all of them are so damn good that I can't make up my mind) but it certainly is up there. <BR>This is a thinking man's metal album, that while being loud, fast and aggressive is still essentially DT doing what no other band can do, namely playing the best hard rock on the planet. <BR>Train of Thought  may not be THE best DT album of all time, but it's still a million times better than every other CD out thereon the shelves today. So my advice is this- if you like quality metal buy this album and if you don't, then quit whining about how DT have lost touch with their roots and go listen to Justin Timberlake.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Dream Theater has yet to top Awake. They have yet to top Images And Words. I got my CD in the mail a few days ago. I played it once, and put it away. I doubt I could even LEARN to like this album. I am a Dream Theater fan...they are the best, most precise musicians I have ever heard. To me they are a compilation of Rush, Queen and Kansas with a turbo attatched. Anybody who doesn't hear these bands in Dream Theater has never listened to these bands. Anyway, the music on this album is mechanical, angry and cold. Very repetitive. Munites and minutes of the same melody and riff, almost industrial, nauseating. If you are looking for Awake, go buy it, or pull it out and listen to it, you will be more satisfied. Did Kirk Hammet from Metalica sit it on this album? Or was it some other refugee from the 80's power metal era?
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I have to write this cornball review, sorry, I am just really impressed with this CD, love love love it.  I also am forced to listen to track 6 over and over by my six year old son, love the guitar, so it never gets old.  Love Chad's voice, love the power of the band, so brilliant in encapturing the true essence of rock and roll.  Very proud that these guys are fellow Albertans, and hopefully they will continue to enjoy success. What could stop them really? They do something really great when they play their tunes and make their music, and somewhere in the world there is a little dude and his mom rockin out on the way to school..<BR>Thanks for that!
B0000TB03W|4.0|You have to get this DVD for a family or a friend this Xmas. It is filled with great performances and Shania looks great! It is a good buy for any music lover!
B000002UY3|4.0|Their 2nd album may have become more popular, but this will always be my favorite. It came out my senior year of high school, and I can't count the times I sat in my car at night, in the park with a cigarette, listening to this album. I was probably wishing she was singing to me. It's hard to think of comparisons, but if you crossed a mellow &quot;Cowboy Junkies&quot;, with a psychedelic &quot;Verve&quot;, you'd be pretty close. &quot;Halah&quot; is a great opener, and the song that made me pick this up. I actually caught the video on MTVs 120 minutes. &quot;Give You My Lovin'&quot; and &quot;Free&quot; are other favorites of mine. Their two following albums are both as great, as is &quot;Hope Sandovals&quot; solo album &quot;Bavarian Fruit Bread&quot;. All of them go well with incense, rain, and candles.
B000089RVR|5.0|This album is quite remarkable. Critics will never understand it for 4 reasons. <BR>a) You need to play the tracks more than once.<BR>b) it requires an attention span longer than three minutes.<BR>c) the songs have 'slow starts', and don't hook you initially.<BR>Also the tracks sound hip hoppy and chillout but really need some volume to hear all the layers.<br />The irony is all the critics moan about mindless junk pop music and when they are given something that isnt , don't even recognise it :-( I suspect artists like Dido can't win)<BR>Some outstanding tracks are See The Sun, 'Dont Leave Home', sand in my shoes and 'Life for Rent'.
B00005JM02|5.0|Maybe I'm the last person on the planet to notice this, but last night with the boys, we were finishing up, (another viewing of) Monster's Inc. and noticed that Nemo makes an appearance near the end of the film.  Has anyone else see this?  A perfect Pixar touch!
B0000TB03W|4.0|Wow, this is such a great DVD. Her performance just gets better and better as the show progresses! You will have to get this DVD!
B0000CAXIC|4.0|It may not be unanimous, but I bet most &quot;Foo Fighters&quot; fans call this 2nd album their best one. It includes the hits &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;Everlong&quot;, and the softie &quot;Walking After You&quot;, which was also on the &quot;X-Files&quot; soundtrack. Plus it has the rockin' &quot;My Hero&quot;, which was on the soundtrack for &quot;Varsity Blues&quot;. But other tracks like &quot;My Poor Brain&quot; and &quot;New Way Home&quot; are just as good. It's pretty solid front to back. I think alot of people were impressed by these guys, and &quot;Dave Grohl&quot; in particular, and after cranking this cd, you will be too. It might just be their, oh, &quot;Nevermind&quot;.
B000002L68|5.0|Purple Rain was an album, a movie, and a defining moment in Prince's career! Prince is the only artist since The Beatles to have the number one movie, album, and single (When Doves Cry) at the same time. This was all possible because of Purple Rain and the talent of Prince. Prince who was born Prince Rogers Nelson has been self produced since 1978 when he signed with Warner Bros Records at the age of 19. Often misunderstood and definately taken for granted.. Prince's Purple Rain is a classic and definately a must buy for anyone who was alive during that era!
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I have not actually gone out and purchased this CD, rather I listened to the snippets on her webpage while I was trying to decide whether or not to purchase it and I've decided not to.  This album reminds me a lot of Madonna's Erotica album, one that I have but I don't enjoy that much.  This album, however, I was quite disappointed by what I heard on it.  The songs don't seem to have much substance and I found myself annoyed by some of them.  The only ones I can actually say have any holding power would be the Kylie Minogue flavored &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and the balladry &quot;Everytime&quot; as well as the chart hit &quot;Me Against The Music&quot;.  For a fan of nothing more than the music, this album was a real disappointment and will be lucky if I change my mind and add it to the other three on my shelf.  I've given it 2 stars just to signify the only songs that are worthwhile.  Sorry Britney....
B0000TB03W|4.0|She is certainly one of the best entertainers out there. She gets her fans all pumped as she takes them on a rollercoaster throughout the whole show. I love this dvd and I want to keep recommending it to everyone out there. It is certainly one of the best I have ever seen. I see lots of good reviews and keep them coming!!!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|The idea behind LET IT BE... NAKED (cringe-inducing album title of the year) is that the remaster is \\"LET IT BE as nature intended.\\" I wonder if that's the case. I wonder if John Lennon, for instance, would have preferred the barebones \\"Across The Universe\\" presented here to the version he originally released as part of the ONE WORLD compilation, or the rough-hewn \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" to the slightly more finished version on the flip side of the \\"Get Back\\" single. Of course, we'll never know.<br />Those who profess to know what the missing two Beatles would have wanted (like those who \\"know\\" that John wouldn't have minded his songs being used as commercial soundtracks) have decided that LET IT BE...NAKED is what Lennon and Harrison would have wanted, and so we have this \\"new\\" CD, alternate takes and mixes of the Beatles' last legitimate release/next to last studio project.<br />It's fascinating listening once or twice through, but the case it tries to make (that the Beatles were above all else a great rock and roll band and didn't need all the production tricks) has already been made in other places, in better ways (the LIVE AT THE BBC set, for instance).<br />The problem with the original LET IT BE, in my mind, wasn't the production; it was the weak songs and the overall tired feel. Whatever they mixed out of LET IT BE...NAKED, those songs and that feel remains.<br />As one who never had a problem with the original Spectorized \\"Long And Winding Road\\" and never really played the original LET IT BE all that much to begin with, I find LET IT BE...NAKED to be kind of extraneous. Unless you're a Beatles completist, save your money.
B000002L9B|5.0|Not that any true Prince fan can just pick one album for a favorite... but this is by far one of my personal favorites. Prince shows all that he is not just a leftover from the 70's (For You, Prince) or that he is not just Sex and Controversy(Dirty Mind, Controversy). He is not just a Pop Sensation (1999, Purple Rain) With ATWIAD and Parade Prince shows us he has depth, range, and true talent. Sometimes it snows in April brings me to tears even to this day 17+ years later.. KISS unfortunately is completely wrong on this album and does not belong. The live version of KISS are much better than the album version. Top Tracks, Girls & Boys, New Position, I Wonder U, and Anotherloverholenyohead. This is a MUST HAVE Prince Album. I liked the movie too.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears' new CD is definately for those that love her or for those that never really cared for her.  The new CD is filled with club music and heavty beats.  Those that dismissed Britney as just bubble gum pop will be surprised, check out &quot;Boom Boom&quot; or &quot;Toxic&quot;.  The stand out song on the album is &quot;Breathe on me&quot; listen to it and see what I mean.  For those never interested in Britney will add this disk to their collection, it is a club/dance cd, reminiscent of Janet Jackson's &quot;janet.&quot;  Enjoy...
B0000TB03W|4.0|UP! Wow, this is a great one. I cannot stop talking about this DVD. I was just watching it earlier today and it makes me so happy. Shania looks hot and her songs mean a great deal to me.
0694003611|5.0|This is the only book by baby would actually sit and listen to ever since he was about 8 months old (he is 11 months old now). We do read him other books, but this one is definetely the winner with him. He likes to play with it too. We are going to buy another copy because our first one is falling apart from the extensive usage! I personally don't know why he likes this book so much, I don't find it to be anything special, but he is the main judge here.
0393312836|5.0|+++++<br /><br />This book (first published in 1962) has three parts.  The first part introduces us to the teenager named Alex who is the narrator of the book.  He is the leader of a small gang in futuristic England until he gets caught for doing the ultimate crime.  The second part has Alex or rather prisoner 6655321 in jail.  In prison, he undergoes an experimental procedure that cures him of his violence.  Part three details what happens to the cured Alex after he gets out of prison.<br /><br />A streak of grotesque surrealism runs through this book especially in part one.  For example, as the gang of hoodlums drive to their \\"surprise visit,\\" they run over a big, snarling toothy thing that screams and squelches, and as they drive back they run over \\"odd squealing things\\" all the way.<br /><br />The most fascinating aspect of this book is the invented vocabulary or futuristic, teenage slang -- it has the effect of putting you in another world.  Alex thinks and talks in this slang.  A doctor in this book explains it: \\"Odd bits of old rhyming slang.  A bit of gypsy talk, too.  But most of the roots are Slav [or Russian] propaganda.\\"<br /><br />Alex as he narrates translates some of this slang.  I found that it is best to compile a running glossary so as to make later reading easier.<br /><br />At first the vocabulary seems incomprehensible: \\"you could peet it with vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom or one or two other veshches.\\"  Then, the reader discovers that some of the meaning is clear from context: \\"to tolchock some old veck in an alley and viddy him swim in his own blood\\" or \\"I kicked the chelloveck in the yarbles and he began to platch.\\"  The meaning of other words become known after a second context.  For example, when Alex kicks someone in the \\"gulliver\\" it might be any part of the body, but when a glass of beer is served with a gulliver, we then can deduce this word's meaning.  The meaning of other words becomes obvious as the reader progresses through the book.<br /><br />Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts.  For example, violence is connected with symphonic music especially the music of \\"Ludwig van.\\"<br /><br />This book is packed with various themes.  The prison charlie or chaplain exposes the central theme of the book in a series of questions to prestoopnick or prisoner 6655321: \\"What does God want?  Does God want goodness or choice of goodness?  Is the man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than the man who has the good imposed on him?\\"<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's movie of the same name catches the book's essence.  However, the movie does not entirely get across the futuristic, nadsat or teenage slang so evident in the book.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a new kind of book.  I can't say I've read another like it.  But I can say that this book contains *** a zammechat razkazz that works for me!!  (For a translation, refer to the title of this review.)<br /><br />+++++book.<br /><br />Another fascinating thing about this book is its contrasts.

0385504209|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book. It seemed to grab me right away. I normally take about a week to read a book. With &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; I couldn't put it down and I finnished it in two days. I will certainly put him on my must read list
B0000TB03W|4.0|This DVD is an absolute must for any Shania fan. Shania has had an impressive carreer so far and she is not slowing down. After watching this DVD you will run out to see Shania live next time she comes around. A lot of artists can make a decent CD but it takes real talent to put on a live show as awesome as Shania does. If you haven't then you HAVE to see what your missing!
