B00GBQ3YXM|5|Thank you
B00LF7TEM2|3|worked very well on one little chip...was just ok on a couple of others.  For the price and effectiveness, I'd have to recommend just getting paint from the dealer.
B0071AYMTW|4|does the job!
B00L6CBI6G|5|Amazing love it. I recommend to put a piece of clear tape on the sticker at normal day to day use will peel it off. I always get comment about it
B00K2DVR6Q|3|Was happy to find a plate with this flag on it. Could have been in a little better condition. Looked a little streaky, but otherwise ok. It actually is a little bigger than I thought. Next time I will measure.
B003XINQE8|4|great purchase I don't regret it at all.
B001D0GS1G|5|great product
B00Y3H0M0E|5|These anchor Bonnets work as advertised for my 2013 Kawasaki Teryx 750 FI. They are easy to adjust and I use 1 for each wheel when secureing my Teryx to my trailer.
B00XN2XLQ2|1|Was not leakproof
B002SDTV4S|5|Easy install. It pumps well. It does what it's supposed to do.. Great product!
B00C0SQC52|4|What's not to like? Nicely made and reasonably priced. I use one in my race car on the fire bottle pin, so I don't forget to remove it before going out on the track and I use one on the disk lock on my motorcycle. Third one is sitting in my draw, but likely going to use that as a key chain.<br />I wouldn't mind if they were a bit larger, but they certainly do the trick as they are.
B00GHSLHWY|5|Perfect fit
B000MIUJMO|3|Great, limited but useful.
B00GUF74HQ|5|works good , good fitting instructions
B00H7MUW8E|4|Great service, excellent price, very pleased with the seat covers, a gift for my husband who liked them very much.  Will definitely recommend the seat covers to friends.  Thanks!
B0007IJR1I|5|Wow I can't believe how well this works.  Follow the directions.
B00Q0BGOQ2|5|Great item....
B0013ERRSK|5|Awesome, I take it with us ever where we go....it's great on car rides, at the dog parks and friend's houses...and it fits in the fridge without taking up a lot of room so I can make sure it stays cold...love it
B005G7Y4C2|5|fsat delivery and great item thanks
B000R5CPAQ|5|Works very well. Just don't forget before testing next cylinder that pressure release button stays pressed (open) as there is no spring to return the button to closed position.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Does the job with NY issued EZ Pass tag (new type). 4 strips is enough to mount a tag on two cars if the tag has Velcro already attached (which typically is the case).
B009FREAGO|4|Great!
B000GD5FMY|5|Great fit, seen better quality from a store but they still work perfect. Great for the money for sure, would buy again.
B00068XCQU|5|good product - great price
B000JP31T8|5|Works great workmanships on point and fits securely on each tappet lock nut. Im sure it can use some slimming doesn't fit some ktm and Honda applications due to its size, But if nothing is in the way over the top of your adjustment there are no problems
B000AP57OO|5|Well worth the money - these are the best air filters on the market !!  Long lasting too.
B000K01V5S|5|The sipping of the Gasket was fast and it worked fine LEW
B00ATTRCEE|5|Perfect kit
B0041PWH88|5|nice product
B00EA3GZI4|4|Love this product.  Looks great
B00KTIUID2|5|Works perfectly in our 2009 Ford F-150.  Followed directions and it took less than 5 minutes to program.  Have also been impressed by the range.
B009GD2GXQ|4|Performs or, out performs original product
B00BI3WLHS|3|was a gift. was ok
B004BTAJ2A|5|Good fits good on my prelude
B00062YOIG|5|Filter is awesome K&N product. The back side of filter housing unit is completely made of silicon rubber, and wish there was like a metal inner ring to give the rubber boot some mounting rigidity.
B00VN1IPS4|4|Yea it was good
B000IZ03G8|1|2003 Silverado 1500 Base 4x4 no Z71. Didn't fit.
B00063XMJ2|5|This worked great
B00XNMF980|5|I installed the first prototype of this improved plenum on my 997.2 Turbo S; with total improvement of throttle response, torque, horsepower and better mileage (as measured in a 2-way drive to and from California from Wyoming: 1-2mpg). IPD intake products are the best performance/cost improvement you can make on a 911.
B006H34BUY|5|Great product. The right size to keep the interior of your car dust free. It does the job well.
B00CBK2T2O|5|great price, good delivery service
B0001L0DFA|2|The nozzle is left hand thread. You will never get used to turning it the wrong way to shut it off. The metal part that you see is steel but, the part that breaks, that you don't see, is plastic. Too expensive to throw away so, I was glad that it finally broke. Never liked the left hand threads, drove me nuts.
B002VFH5J6|5|Congratulations, if you bought this and watch a YouTube video you just saved yourself about $60 by doing this yourself instead of the dealer doing it for you.
B00YX6BLVE|5|Great seat covers, but kind of a pain to put on.
B0002NIK3E|5|Perfect for our spare tire on the back of trailer. Can't beat for the price
B000GZLTSG|5|just what I wanted
B009382HA6|5|popped it in and it works fine
B000C5DZWI|5|Fixed the damper issue on my 05 Focus - worked great!
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works great on a Galaxy S5 using the Torque app; able to read various sensor information while driving such as speed, coolant temp, intake temp. I have a layout in the Torque app set to display GPS speed side by side with ECU sensor speed to see how accurate the speedometer is. This does also work to read and clear fault codes (check engine light).
B002P8T45W|5|Worked out great. Went on car just like original. No problems!!!!
B000CGHTNI|3|Worked fine on 01 outback. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is in the past the Delphi knock sensors have always been the same part as the dealer. Even in the picture it shows the part number and Japan on it . When I received it this time though it says made in America and is not the oem one.<br /><br />Worked perfect, but still felt slightly deceived
B011J54W80|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Hundreds of little &#34;car wash style&#34; scent squares. I will have these for a while. They make my car smell great. They even work in my house!
B000CPI5Z0|5|My daughters car was hesitating a lot within the first 10 minutes. The Sentra has 80,000 miles on it.<br />I added 1 bottle and by time she reached 1/2 a tank the car stopped hesitating.<br />I feel it is worth the extra money.<br />The injectors are clean and it saved me a trip to the mechanic.
B0051ZIJKC|5|Worked like a charm!!
B002QS3F9C|5|Awesome product.
B00LO4KHHW|2|I agree with one of the reviews here: it does not fit and tighten well. I have a 2015 rav4. yes it can be installed but it is not a good fit. even you can tighten the bolt but it will end up problems due to the vibrations. Note that the rav4 has a tapered muffler tip. I would suggest something better than this.
B001GG895K|5|Very satisfied with product and provider
B00E2SK4JI|5|My size is 32W/34L so that's what I've ordered and it was a perfect fit.<br />They are heavy and thick, which is exactly what I wanted. And there are removable hips and knee pads.
B009B42FB8|1|Purchased two strut assemblies for my car.  Order arrived and boxes were labelled Monroe 172199 and Monroe 172200 strut assemblies, just as I orderred, unfortunately one of the boxes contained the wrong product.  I was out of town when product arrived, so I had my sons inspect the units when they arrived.  At first glance the struts looked OK, however, when I was installing them approx. 39 days after they arrived I discoverred that both struts were for the right / drivers side.  The box labelled Monroe 172199 had the wrong part in it.
B00A82A3RK|5|Great battery
B00G6RLRJY|4|Application: 2014 Suzuki DL1000A V-Strom<br /><br />Installation: The actual work is fairly simple, but figuring out a good layout of the components is a time-consuming puzzle.  The oil reservoir tube needs to be sloped upward so as to not spill, yet it must be free from kinks and away from any damaging components (hot or sharp).  A volt meter is recommended for the wiring, just to be certain that you are splicing into appropriate wires.  Similarly, route wire with care.  The tube that dispenses the oil onto the chain has an inner wire to retain shape.  That wire perhaps a bit thicker than a coat hanger, to give a sense of its workability and what tools you should have on-hand to cut it (i.e. not side cutters intended for copper wire).  The control unit location is then a compromise based on what makes every other component ok.<br /><br />On areas where it looked like the oil tube could become damaged, I covered it with a piece of heat-shrink tubing that I just happened to have on-hand.  In a pinch, I suppose that electrical tape or such might also work.<br /><br />Operation: Keep the instructions or the supplied reference card available.  While not complicated, changing settings requires a very specific sequence.  I originally set it up for ~3 seconds and left it like that for 500+ miles.  The chain looked clean and well-oiled, despite riding in some rainy weather.  A small amount of oil was flinging off, so I tried to reduce the time and will re-evaluate.<br /><br />I am now near 1000 miles with the system and the oil consumption rate looks like it will allow refill intervals of 3000+ miles.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is not plug-and-play.  You need to be ready to customize a DIY solution.  If you are not scared off by that, then this can be used to keep your drive chain in optimal condition.
B00SKFWYD8|1|Glue gun is very cheaply made. The glue doesn't stick well. Can't pop a dent at all. Cheap product in general, do not buy anyone at all.
B00FF1K7BQ|5|This is best air freshener I have ever bought. It is true that it doesn't last very long, but if you know how to use one bottle will last you months. What I do is I dilute 1 portion to 2 of distilled water in a small spray bottle. I spray that on the carpet all over the car. Then I spray undiluted on to a microfiber rag and apply it to my leather seats. The first time it may be very strong but as you do it several times you will learn to spray just the right amount. This is for the leather scent, I haven't tried the &#34;NewCar smell&#34; but I'm pretty sure it will be just as good. As the smell goes away I spray the diluted one a few times to renew the smell. Be careful and test on a small area before applying.
B00MOKLRS8|5|Looks good easy to install, instructions confusing just put it together without it.
B00JVORME8|1|Batteries get stuck tight in 5out of 8 and one of them stays on all the time until you take the batteries out.
B00BR4JCSE|5|Sick
B00651C998|5|I broke off my factory antenna on my truck and used this to replace it. the radio reception is good
B00E3QHUGE|5|Great holster for pocket carry or clipless IWB holster. It has such a good grippy texture that it stays firmly in place while drawing from the pocket or IWB. Fits my Colt Mustang, Sig P238, and my Taurus PT111 Millenium Pro G2. Fits the Taurus the best. I would highly recommend.
B003L643KS|5|Good way to have more panels working together
B00RF9J8DY|4|Love it. Works well... compact, lightweight, and good quality tools for the price
B00G247CZY|5|nice little set fast delivery
B00G9TJUT8|5|Quality chain, after initial stretch maintains tension very well.
B000WYYP14|5|Fit perfectly and operates as expected.
B000BPOI8O|5|Works great. 2-cycle motors need new plugs often.  Thanks
B001URT094|5|Great using as baseball gloves since they have protection on nuckles.
B00PG70UAC|5|super
B00IBKA2VS|5|Works as described, plus alot of the heat is now gone. What I don't know is how much my mileage will be affected since it's running richer now.
B001AWK8J0|5|Ride is smooth now!
B000ND0WB6|5|I have several Battery Tenders and most of them are hooked to vehicles with permanently fastened connections that bolt on to the battery posts. These gator clip ones are useful for other batteries where you don't have those connections.
B00Z89I2OY|5|The fit and look of these are great, I highly recommend!
B00ZQXU67I|5|one month and working well. if you have a trailer hitch it connects easy. Reverse light may be a little harder to install because the four wire standard trailer hitch doesn't have a reverse light wire. So you need to search for one and tap into it unless you have the round type hitch plug.
B00514AIN4|5|worked perfect . Got my order fast and it fit
B003SNR0DG|3|Only reason I'm giving 3 stars is that rolling up window is just as stiff as the one that recently broke. I lubed it and everything. Can't seem to make it operate any better
B0043XPGM2|5|Very classy & elegant!
B000BP7M8W|3|You get what you pay for.
B00OXPXUAK|5|Compact and pairs easily. Works well.
B005T7ZL7G|5|Perfect addition to our 2011 Odyssey.  Now we can vent the windows on hot days without worrying about rain getting inside.  We have had these on every vehicle owned and I stand behind Weathertechs product.  The fitting is very tight, but I installed these in a matter of minutes.  Just be careful not to apply too much torque when fitting it into the channel.  It is plastic and CAN break.
B00FW82Y0E|5|Most durable stickers ever.
B000TYTR1U|5|Exact replacement.  Quality product.
B004UIUIGO|5|Very good
B000BZI4K2|5|Works great.
B007IKN17O|3|good fit; have created a runablity problem that I am unsure why
B00CTVGO80|4|very good quality.
B00QL17460|5|Good price and ready for next mowing season.
B003BZ9LRO|5|Excellent service and part was just what I needed to make some noise.
B00A9VVK3G|3|it work sometime
B00NMX1OSO|5|Really nice quality
B005PQRUOS|5|It works
B000WK4EC8|5|The only thing left from when I owned a motorcycle is this great cleaner.  I use it on my bicycle, gas grill, car wheels, etc.
B00T6JCVXK|5|Super sic
B0068VJ0NI|4|Excellent service! As per instructions, ensure skin is very warm to make installation easier.
B005I5397I|5|I got the key almost right away. I took the key to get cut, followed the included directions, and the key works amazingly!! Looks just like the original key!!
B00496F0GK|4|Very good
B006GZBMQO|5|Worked perfectcly on my 2007 Frontier.<br />Received before the expected day.
B000BQPIGY|5|Excellent product
B00CDO9GJW|2|I didn't realize that these just stuck on with two-sided, padded tape and within a day or two the tape started to let go and now rain enters my car anyway.
B00NB8WLY6|5|Got to admit I feel like a have a Bentley look now :) the interior bulbs give it an elegant look to the luxury sedan, money well spent considering this is my second purchase from this brand :)
B007Q9VHNM|2|I bought this puller to get the innerring of a small (8x22x7) bearing from a shaft. Getting it on was quite easy, even with the rough thread on the screws. But the spindle was as soft as butter. The pointed tip flattened with the just a little force. So I did plan B, grinding the ring off. It was for an electric motor of a B&D weed wacker and it runs fine now with at least one &#34;real&#34; bearing.<br />To be honest, I did not expect much from it for the price but this was far below my already low expectation.
B002S3Y0SU|4|Seems like a great light. It was easy to install. But that could be because I keep backing into things with my trailer and have gotten allot of practice at it.<br /><br />Seriously....just match the wire colors and use some wire crimps and your set up. There isn't anything else to say about this product.
B000C4087O|5|Yeah, it's expensive, but if you've ever tried to pull an oil filter from a 2003-2007 Camry with a regular OF wrench, you know that nut on the end is worth it...
B004Y8LB7K|5|I bought this for my 2013 Honda Civic EX  Sedan. It fits perfectly. It is a not hard to roll up.<br />I couldn't be happier with this product!! I highly recommend this sunshade!!<br /><br />Rachelle
B00OYR6LEE|5|Fit perfect. A lot cheaper than the dealer
B001M3ZKEK|1|Complete garbage. I am very knowledgeable when it comes to doing electrical work and for the most part am pretty smart when it comes to mechanical stuff but I OBVIOUSLY am an idiot for thinking for just one brief second that this piece of s#!/ product would add HP. It did absolutely nothing not to mention like the other review said half the monitors that it says it's capable of doing (when u read the fine print it states only available on very select cars and even then it's possible that they won't work even if hooked up correctly). I basically can't return this piece of junk and now I have a $250 gauge that tells me air to fuel and throttle position. Please don't make the same dumb decision I did. But if u honestly believe I don't know what I'm taking about I'll sell you mine at half the price of the cheapest one on here and you can find out for yourself. Please take me up on my offer someone. Prove me wrong.....Ha ha ha
B000GZQP08|4|Does what it says on the tin
B000C5FJ36|3|Wrong item  my truck has 4.6l new body style with W motor and is a 4 pin connector . Part described was 3 pin. Check your connector before ordering.
B00QDCMBHE|5|Looks awesome
B00BPC073C|4|Am very satisfied with the results of the repair that the part ordered provided. Thank you
B003XRMIG6|5|I love it
B00065JM8U|3|I ordered two for my motorhome and both are noisy.  I oiled the front bearing and the fan blade coasted a little more on shut off rather than coming to a immediate  stop.  After playing with it for a while I noticed that when I touched the fan guard it was quieter.  That lasted for a while and then more noise.  I am going to keep them cause I am to lazy to return them and am hoping they will quiet down with more use.
B006CRT72W|1|SUCKS  I ordered a couple of these and they last about a week each
B00P2HRGPI|5|a vast improvement over the lousy rubber junk Jeep provides as stock... make sure you have a universal joint socket and some extensions to get at the nuts under the hood. Also need to remove the air cleaner to get in there... not a big deal, just a little patience... but the result is an amazing difference in the appearance of your Jeep.
B00E5OUOCQ|4|I live in Michigan. Reflects sun, no insulation like the more expensive ones out there. Good value for the cost.
B00T2RBYSO|5|excelente...
B001PSN2LA|5|there is no better product for quick clean up on leading edge of a airplane
B005CEKIQU|4|We needed to fix a hole in a bedroom door and this worked like a charm to fill it in.  Good consistency and easy to use.  Never used it before, but pleased with the end result and how it bonded very well.
B00KIEASPK|5|Good
B00NLXEIBU|5|ok
B009LJLOUQ|5|Easy install and they look great. Did not use the top spacer on the front guards. The top spacer made the top edge of the guard not lay flat against the trim molding. Make sure you put the metal clips on the metal frame during install. 2015 Durango.
B00C0T2Z8Y|1|Does not look OEM! They should put more pics! Not the one i wanted to have! A good quality though.
B005VKLGUW|1|The small screw used in the keycase shell is screwed too tight. The small screw driver provided wont work to open it.
B00SXCA64C|5|Being a retiree with lots of time on his hands, I've taken up car detailing this past year.  Not professionally, but I've got responsibility for taking care of five different vehicles.  (Long story)  Any way, these pads get plenty of use on the vehicles when it comes time to polishing/sealing/waxing and glazing.  Don't want to get the polish on your black rubber trim - grab one of these microfiber sponges and trim the rubber leaving a safety area where your Cyclo or Flex can get the rest of the job done.  Clean up for me is simple - I use an all-purpose cleaner (Ex. Simple Green) that is sprayed on the used portion of the pad.  Massage the cleaner into the pad and then rinse with a strong flow of water.  Me - I clean these pads in the driveway and hose 'em down afterward.  Don't dry them in the sun - just leave them to air-dry in the garage is sufficient.  These pads see a ton of work.  Will they wear out?  Probably - but for a long time.  Take care of them and they'll take care of your vehicle.
B00DCR7TN4|2|Struggles to play my favorite station with a tower around 20 miles away.
B000O0BUNW|5|Item was exactly what I needed. I am very pleased with the item and the fast shipment. No complaints!
B007PLZGO2|5|Love it. Goes on easy, looks great.<br /><br />I have hated these Stick Figure Families as much as those signs telling me to be especially diligent about not rear-ending someone because there was a &#34;Baby-on-Board&#34;
B000GG1IHC|5|Nice factory accessory. Easy to install, looks great, and is very functional. Took minutes to get it centered, and fastened with the tape already installed on the pad. Just get it in place, peel, and press.. You're done. Well worth the money!
B00MQQDQDO|4|Looks great and was very easy to unstall. Makes my Fusion just a little different than most you see from the rear.
B006B2YI6S|5|Birthday gift for my son.  He chose this because it was custom fitted for his F150 and he loves it!
B009W4QPN6|4|Found the price of these to be very cost effective and they appear to be of the highest quality.
B005FLZ19Y|5|Perfect fit & looks like new!
B00E3EJ2GW|5|Fast shopping like advertised and part was good
B001CAW2DK|5|as expected
B008A2C2X8|5|Good, No problems.
B005F9IZTO|5|Buy this one and save. Opened box and Bosch sensor us inside for half the cost and  car runs great.
B002YKDJ3O|5|Excellent sanding board for large panels.
B0067PUMXW|5|looks awesome on car window just have patience putting it on
B006X152SU|4|nice price for what you get<br />bought 4 all together over the last 9 months, all smells mildewy and musty, but wears off fast and for the price works well.<br />one caution is I had one break within 3 months, the strap ripped off.<br />its of semi poor quality construction, but again for the price its a good buy
B000FN7JE2|5|I use this alot on SBC,BBC,SBF and LS engines. No issues or complaints here!
B009PF8EM2|5|all good
B006C29HCW|5|Worked fine on 2010 Challenger to adapt to 3rd party radio, car is base with no sat radio or gps.
B003X9TLUK|3|Product works great once installed. Got the keys mixed up and the mower wouldn't roll forward reversed their direction and works like a charm. However the transmission doesn't come with the top holes threaded so I had to stop go buy a 1/4 inch tap and do it myself which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. This wasn't a very difficult a job and it didn't seem to have that many washers and locking pins 4 or 5 on each side. Just watch the key orientation and get ready to tap your own threads.
B009B9MTTG|5|solidly stays up in my 05 Celica. Folds neatly away when done.
B00MJDWM2U|5|Great product
B000MDB6EY|5|Looks better in than I expected. Good quality
B008RMVM78|5|Good product, great service
B000C11JHU|5|Made a tremendous diff. in operation of window. I like it so much that I ordered the driver's door side also. They even supplied new mounting screws with the unit. Great.
B00495WK5U|5|worked good
B00ED3YVWS|5|Incredible reverse lights for a Wrangler. They fit and work well. 08 JK Unlimited Rubicon
B00HB0WUB4|5|Excellent product, very pleasant aroma
B0000AY1W1|5|2nd time purchase... enough said
B000JL95TC|5|Our neighbor keeps bees and we have a pool the bees like to visit. These work like a dream to keep the bees away. I've never noticed Mosquitos so it must work for them also.
B006GJKANG|5|Not installed yet, but shipping was fast, not expecting problems, had other parts from same manufacturer before
B000AOMQ80|5|The stuff works as advertised...actually better that advertised since they say it will hold for two years and I have had it in a lawn tractor tire for over five years with no problems.  I have had no experience using the product in tires that rotate at high speeds, such as auto tires, but on slow speed tires such as dolly or lawn tractors, this stuff will keep your tires inflated for years.  Very happy with the purchase since it does what is advertised and then some.
B002WH7B0G|5|perfect fit and way cheaper then the local dealer.
B00ICNSLN0|5|It's a sticker. It sticks.
B00KTHYEAQ|5|Once we got the right date, was easy to set.
B000GV1UFM|4|Motion pro does it again. I liked it everything is authentic and it comes in its own box which is cool. Ive only used to a handful of time but haven't had any issues.
B00VO4ZODE|4|I do not understand how they work,but they most certainly do.I am very satisfied.
B010G1143Y|5|Works amazingly well for the price. Used it on 2 cars already and it's not showing any signs of giving out any day soon
B0043DSGX8|1|Would give 0 stars if I could, there are junk. All four I ordered were ovaled and bent, did not come close to fitting a 2.5&#34; pipe.
B00UYNKP9O|2|The fit of this sticker was a 4/5 (left some areas of the filler cap exposed).<br /><br />The adhesive was not very strong at all.  I prepped the area with alcohol and adhered it in a warm garage but it did not want to stick.<br /><br />If you do purchase it, be careful whilst handling it - I broke the bottom, thin portion after bending it slightly.
B00K7XNEE4|4|This Cover fit and looks great the material was a little thin but for the price it's OK
B00QJTCSJW|4|The quality of these levers was great!  They feel as solid as much more expensive CRG levers but I'm sure they are not as durable under pressure and they don't have the warrant.<br /><br />I'm rating 4/5 because the clutch lever was a MM too wide to fit in replacement of the OEM levers on my 2005 Yamaha YZF-R6.  I just grinded it down a bit and it popped right in.  It's possible that it didn't fit because I have laid the bike down on that side before and the aluminum housing for the lever might have been bent in the process :)
B00KWGU71Y|3|Nice fit but rather expensive for a small piece of plastic .
B00JXYFZN6|5|Good quality as advertised...fit was right on...use all the parts you can...use the seals in the kit...will order again when we need to fix other cars...
B00460L6B2|5|Replacement mirror for passenger side on 1998 Southwind fit great.
B00DDZE33E|5|I tested out on the water for four hours with a electric motor on my kayak... never lost power. Excellent!
B000CKDO7E|5|Great Fit.
B001UMZ07A|5|Used just regular wax on my black car and got a bad finish with white specks all over the front of the car. Used this product and it cleaned out all the old white wax and filled it in with the black wax. Made a lot of the swirl marks practically unnoticeable. Great stuff for a black car. Highly recommended!
B00CMEY14I|5|Great.  Good quality
B004BOH6BM|5|A+++ NO MORE odors
B009F5AMR2|5|take 20 min to get on my f150  1999

B00RV417XM|5|Very bright. The white has a delay after turn signal shuts off and when lights come on. Amber has no delay so as safety it is just fine. Colors are great and bright.
B00F0QAPBI|5|I bought this item for my 2015 kia optima well it fits super great everyone says it makes the car look sexy. Great buy and fit!!
B000CJ05XQ|5|This is great for leaving the Bitwriter cable in a hidden place (but easily accessible), so in case you need to change settings in the future, you do not need to pull out the alarm brain to plug in your Bitwriter cable.
B0034NS9AS|3|One bag was defective.  Called company.  Took 4 weeks to get warranty claim in mail.  Otherwize good product.
B0043OV0IA|4|Allows you to do things by yourself, where menial tasks may require 2 people.  I was able to move a non-running car into a small space all by myself.  In this small space, I was not able to use my truck (equipped with a winch) because there was no room for me to park my truck in between the small space and the broken car.  Sure, I could ask a neighbor or two to help push the car, but I have a lot of gravel and cinder on the ground, so it's no easy task.<br /><br />Now for the cons, as the reason why I rated this 4 out of 5 stars.  The unit only has a 15' long cable.  You will need rope or another strap (with a minimum of 1000 lbs working load limit).  15' is definitely too short.  At $180, Warn should've provided a small strap, or extension to this.<br /><br />The other con to this unit is the poor duty cycle rating.  If using this to pull 1000 lbs, the duty cycle is 1 min on and 30 min off.  If using this to pull 500 lbs, the duty cycle is 2 min on and 30 min off.  I used my portable fan to blow on this unit to help cool it off.  I don't want to ruin the motor.
B000182EUU|5|looks good,.nice product
B00HVM4S58|1|I brought a silver paint for my bmw x1.  the paint is very thin , and the color is off . it does not cover and match. I will buy the brush factory paint next time.
B007JEJQP0|5|Easy installation and it looks good and works well.
B001EOV492|5|Item was just as described, very happy with purchase!
B003AT4RHK|4|I can't say I wanted to purchase this but if f I had I probably would have given it 5 stars. As long as it does not prematurely fail it's probably a 5 star product. It seems very well built, everything on it is well labeled  making it easy to install and it is very intuitive assuming someone has wired in trailer  lights before.
B000E2ANSI|5|Perfect fit. No noted increase in power, but wasn't expected anyway.
B00HSTAF9W|5|It's not as big as it seems there are plenty of the same size for cheaper! But it's great quality! A bit on the expensive side tho like I said there are far better deals for the 5&#34;
B005H5XT2O|2|They work. Very small.  This brand is for todlers not. Young children.  R4R4
B00I3OEXSK|5|Great quality nothing bad to say about it!
B004RION6S|5|I bought one of these type of labels several years ago. Because the last it so well and so long I decided to buy these. These look to be the same quality as that original one was. I would recommend and buy these again when I get a new car.
B00FPT7K36|5|Very satisfied with product and provider
B003SKCARK|5|Works great and is easy to apply. The 'waterproof' aspect wears out quickly but that's to be expected with something made from beeswax.
B00CJUW3HW|3|I love the way this looks, but when I applied it to my laptop I couldn't get the clear tape off. The decal kept coming up with it, so I just left it on for fear I would ruin the whole thing.
B005VFJO42|3|I purchased a set of these some time back and put them in right away, the lights look very nice and worked well at first. I am starting to have problems with the tail light on the left side. Sometimes it works okay, other times it fades out as one other purchaser mentioned. The plugs seemed to be a perfect match to the factory but I did have a difficult time getting them to pug together. Wish that they would have worked properly longer, I am now looking for another set.
B004GD92YW|1|Very disappointed in this purchase. Headlights are not new nor are they original equipment. These are refurbished lens. I returned them.
B000BRFQOW|5|good quality and works well
B004HELSU6|5|Does good job
B00TOUDCLG|5|These front A-arm guards are great. I've had them installed for about two months now and they have taken a beating and still look brand new!
B001NAP2D6|5|One of the best.
B00YEHNP7K|4|Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome light and lights up quite a bit. It just seems to me for $220 it should've been MORE awesome
B00BOUAFK0|2|Not as clear and vibrant as portrayed, in fact I almost applied them upside-down because I couldn't make out which way the skulls were facing in broad daylight. In the end they're just too small to be a really effective graphic, and without an accompanying theme of the same type - your &quot;insert vehicle here&quot; will just look hodge-podge. Vinyl was medium quality and I pulled them off after a month because they looked stupid.
B007R4GA2E|5|good
B00FDW8T8U|5|I was originally in need of a way to give my young son some peace of mind. I knew that some extra storage for riding ans sports gear on my NC700X wouldn't hurt. Combining the two ideas, I went with the 47 liter Givi. The 46 liter was just a bit too round for my taste.<br />  I worried the 47 might look too big for the bike, but with the backrest pad, the lines are nice and clean. I would recommend adding LED lights for safety. They sit at a good eye level. Locked down on its mounting, it is quite secure and feels solid. No issues with anything rattling loose in a month's worth of riding.<br />  For space, it easily holds both my full face helmet (L) and my son's full face helmet (S), or all of his football gear, helmet included (youth size).
B003AT4RHK|1|I bought mine and it never worked from day 1 .I took it to a trailer light place and they said the converter was no good. I told him I just bought it and he said I need another one that works. Was a total waste of money and a lot of time trying to figure it out on my own. Don't buy one.
B002ZTGLFC|5|a+
B000MS5T42|1|Worked well on the first three caps then it wouldn't connect adequately.  There is no adjustment.  There are others out there (Milwaukee) that look better.  This was a waste of time and money
B00TIU4Y50|5|My 2003 Silverado extended cab Tachometer, Speedometer, Oil Pressure, and Volt meter went on the fritz about 3 years ago. I finally got around to fixing the instrumentation cluster this year. The repair kit is exactly what I needed. The step motors are quality products and all four worked great. The project took about 1.5 hours to complete. Taking the cluster out and putting back in was simple as popping off the dash trim. Unscrewing 4 bolts. Disconnecting the wiring harness and  removing the old stepping motors and soldering the new ones back in. You can find numerous YouTube videos on the whole process. If you have any experience in soldering this task should be very simple... If not I would not attempt this repair.  Pros: Quality products Non Scuff pry bar is a very handy tool and I have used it on numerous other projects such as car door panel removal. replacement dash bulbs are a nice touch  Cons: Can't think of any
B000WO9F5K|5|perfect fit, high quality windshield, I would highly recommend this windshield.
B00ROJVK9A|3|Cheaply made but it's funny
B006OQ35GU|5|Absolute must for a first time RV er as this way you can see if your black water tank is clean when flushing.
B006R0XYGY|5|Worked perfectly. These were worth buying.
B00823FSRC|5|Best camping purchase we've ever made. Yes, the wheels stink terribly at first, but that goes away. This has made hauling our heavy canoe so much easier – even long distances from our campsites down to the water. I also like how it folds up for storage.
B008KIGCBA|5|Great product.
B001QUHFQA|3|works
B000COBK8A|4|I ordered these for a VW Passat wagon that had a wimpy single note horn that was hard to hear even as I was tooting it. I just wan't getting any respect from other motorists whenever I tried to show my disapproval.<br />Now, judging by the gestures the motorists make, I KNOW that I am being heard.<br />Physical installation was a breeze but electrical connections had to be customized since these horns are designed to be universal and the lower price reflects that.
B0050NGI7G|5|This is more of a heavy leather jacket I'm 6'1 250<br />And I have broad shoulders so I normally wear a 50 cause that's what I am in chest but I ordered 54 and it fit great so if I were anyone thinking of this great jacket at a wonderful price I would definitely move up a site are two, other than that it's a wonderful leather jacket.....<br />God bless and happy riding
B0022XO9OQ|5|Fits well, looks great! A significant step up from the stock seat on Honda Shadow Spirit.
B001B5GA0C|5|Very good oem replacement
B0002JMEJ4|5|supposed to be good quality over autoparts brand but now way for me to check. Added on 2 cars that my family owns and would recommend to others without hesitation if one doesnt have the money to buy mastercool/robinair/...<br />Important part of the process is to properly vacuum for a decent amount of time. I will add pictures of what the oil looks like later.<br />and very good price<br />most repair shop tends to go for cheapest oil that's available but fjc, as much as i know, holds a decent quality control in the hvac (not the best in hvac industry but good enough for diyers).
B00H36XX6C|5|To be honest, when I first read the product description and price, I was fully expecting to receive an overpriced piece of junk - there are plenty of battery/flashlights here on Amazon for a third of the price of this pack - but once I received it, I realized that this product is quite a bit more sophisticated than most cheap battery packs.<br /><br />For starters, this pack has the capacity to charge an iPad - on my USB power meter, I registered just over 2A, enough to power and use the current generation iPad.<br /><br />The flashlight is ridiculously bright for the size of the pack - this is one of those where the 250 lumen rating really is true.<br /><br />Things it lack; there is no way to tell how much power is left, and there is no included USB charger, but quite frankly, the IP65 waterproof rating and amazing flashlight more than make up for that.<br /><br />Definitely a good backup product to carry in your pack, whether you travel or trek, it really could be your next best friend.
B00AO0E5QQ|5|Tough and durable tool set that will last, did not realize how wrong it is to approach interior and trim without the right tools.  Took me 25 years of restoring and modifying cars to figure this out.  This is where it's at.
B001J85CJ6|1|it was bent. I ordered two and only got one
B00E975LH2|5|Love this stuff
B000NW8GOM|5|It's an oil filter and it fits.
B0007LZK9S|5|its a pin quick ship good quality
B0084UJOPU|5|Great product as advertised.
B00EL1K9CS|5|Great emblem
B00J62ZVSE|5|Great price! Great fit! Easy to install, color coded for each side. Very happy.
B0041TOQ06|4|Fairly easy to install. Made an immediate difference, eliminating the bad smell at startup that seems to be a problem with the Audi.I would buy this again.
B004BUWPIK|5|Works great!!!
B000TD20LA|4|This tool is easy to use and has testing options many others don't. It seems a bit fragile so should be used by technicians who will take care of it.<br />You will find that you probably want the printer and current clamp so it's probably a better value to buy a set that comes withe these included.
B009OBVRY4|5|THIS TOOL IS EXCELLENT and makes my love of having a sparkling car a near-daily reality.  LOVE LOVE LOVE it.
B0024ECDL4|5|WORKS
B005R20JFC|5|This light fit perfect and easy to install. I did it my self and it looks just like the original one. No scratches everything was in good shape and still  in good shape.
B00WIXDD3S|4|Simple, cheap, bolt on lift... only problem was I had to get longer U-bolts... woulda been nice to get those with the lift kit.
B00063X7KG|5|I used this on my car and was amazed at the difference it makes!  The following month...niece came by and we did her car too - which helped prep it for the follow on Meguiar's steps AND that detailing certainly helped when they promptly sold it prior to deploying overseas with USMC...  Bottom line - excellent product, easy to use!
B0078U9WDG|5|Exactly what was expected and fast shipping.
B00ZYV9GGE|5|These were really nice covers. Unfortunately they didn't fit my vehicle, so one size doesn't fit all. The five stars are because they were so well built and looked really sharp.
B00IAIPAHM|4|I got the grass camo, I put it on my Winchester sx3 semi auto. And it turned out pretty good! I'd give it a 7/10 for what I did! I would maybe recommend having someone who is good with stickers or body work stuff. It took about 3hrs.. I left the side with the chamber cause I wanted the sx3 to show and it was way way to hard! Stock was easy followed by the forearm. Barrel was actually quite difficult. But I made it work. The reason it gets 4/5 cause of time consumption.
B00DIHRT5Q|4|Works for my application.  2500 lbs capacity works for me but might be a little light under some other needs.
B00U8KXQ8A|1|did not fit
B004ME32SM|5|Exactly what every Rv needs
B003TSOQY6|5|If you've ever pulled a battery from a newer vehicle and had to spend a couple hundred bucks at the dealership for reprogramming, you know why you need this...
B0024NT0HA|4|The lights arrived in about four days in very good shape. I was very surprised how easy they were to instal and looked great. I would strongly suggest if you are thinking about purchasing this product don't hesitate at all. You will be surprised how easy they install and look. I did have one small issue I'm hoping they will take care of. The bright light does not work on the driver side I'm thinking it is just a bad bulb. I will give another update if they do not send a replacement bulb.
B005A5YQ2I|4|It's a great product, I used it on my jeep, and it worked great , I am very happy with how it looks. It arrived really fast. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the package arrived a bit damage, but I was able to make use of all the wrap
B000VLF8A0|3|Way over priced for what it is; but it works
B00AA41RLM|5|gift for a friend, she loved it
B00B0QWXW6|5|GOOD.
B006O0H9PO|5|Perfect fit, everything was great, fast shipping!
B00BO3UBNI|5|Excellent product excellent fit and first class shipping. Couldn't be happier.
B00E1SN0TK|1|Wouldn't recommend these to anybody unless you're deaf. Nothing but squeak noises for the first few stops! Also pads did not come with hardware/clips.
B0055T53CG|2|-It is expensive<br />-There is not enough material to close the seam. If you attempt to force the seam closed the material will rip.<br />-There is just barely enough thread to sew the cover on.<br />-Looks terrible because the seam is not closed. Looks very amateur.<br /><br />For 50 dollars I expected better.
B00AKFUHCQ|5|I added these on my 2015 iron 883N. They are pretty loud and sound great for super cheap.
B003WOZOUM|5|It might be a bit smaller than one would hope but it does the job very well. Drove from NJ to GA with no problems. Survived light to medium rain without leaking.
B00WFIK208|5|Once I installed it you could tell the extra horse power and don't have to fill up on gas nearly a as much as I would highly recommend
B005DUN2KC|5|These were a perfect fit and I had no problem getting over the throttle handle on my motorcycle. I had these on my 80's BMX bike when I was a kid and it's fun to have them on my grown up bike.
B003V3V68S|5|If you would have asked me a year ago if I'd consider spending $25 on glass cleaner I'd probably look at you funny.  Things change however when you buy a nice car and have tinted windows.  After reading Matt's suggestions on obsessedgarage.com I bought this stuff and the packaged deal with microfiber cloths was an added bonus.<br /><br />It works, that's basically it.  It removes the small water stains on glass from washing your car and not fully drying the windows fast enough and leaves a really nice, streak free appearance on the interior without damaging tint.<br /><br />The bottle is a really niced sized, weighted well and a great nozzle on it.  I will most likely buy this buy the gallon next time and re-use the bottle.  I also use it kind of sparingly, so it's not like it will be empty anytime soon.
B000E7FNAQ|4|As Discribed,  don't much care for the chrome but the filter works and fits fine
B00SSM2UXC|3|WORK WELL BUT WAAAAAY OVER PRICED. ALSO ROLL UP -  DON'T FOLD. SO IF YOU ALWAYS HAVE PEOPLE IN THE BACK SEAT THEY WOULD BE A BOTHER.
B0083W18IU|5|Worked, had to drill choke cable adjuster so choke cable would fit it
B00GOGKUHW|5|Had dealer install it to make sure it was done properly.
B009YR00MI|5|It is what I needed.
B005ZWM0R4|4|Great cable but the software is not good.
B008K5O8BE|5|Bumper seems very durable and looks sweet on my 09 z400
B00S68U8GO|4|works great for  a worklight
B00F4PB8QQ|5|As the description says, spray on and buff off for an awesome shin....you will love this product
B00HPNR7DI|1|Installed this sensor and still had the same problem. Went and bought a Borg Warner sensor and it fixed the concern. Had to tear the engine down twice to make repairs. Should have bought an expensive known sensor in the first place
B00852684M|2|Not too impressed with these at all. Lights don't stay on as the wheels turn. Its almost like they are meant for off-roading where they need to be shaken really hard at all times to stay on. You may end up with a better set than I did, but don't expect much from them.
B002YQR9PC|5|it's amazing to put on the back of her car
B00Z7KIZPA|1|I was so excited when I saw this product on TV. My purse constantly flies off my passenger seat or is in the way whenever I have a passenger. I was delighted to see someone had a cure for my problem. Unfortunately, this product is not what I expected. It is much too small to hold my purse, which isn't very big. Additionally, it sits too far back for me to reach, even if I could put something in there. Since it was so cheap, I'll keep it. But what a disappointment!
B00WGYNUJ6|5|super easy to do, only took about an hour and a half. ended up not using the spray nozzle cause it just felt weird. 100% satisfied
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Going camping can't wait to use it for charging cell phones and laptop.
B000N9LWKK|5|Just like the picture
B0028088U4|5|Everything perfect and as promised. A+
B00IJBXNHE|5|great
B00UZYIGMU|5|Seems to work well, less expensive to replace than at the dealer and easy to do after I checked online for my vehicle: a Kia Optima.
B004LWVEKS|4|I bought this charger since I have a couple rechargeable 6 volt batteries and the leads are higher quality than the normal SAE connectors most chargers use. Also, having the ability to charge 12 volt lithium batteries is nice to have since some motorcycles batteries are using that chemistry now. The repair mode seems to have saved an older Optima battery in my truck from having to be replaced, my old conventional charger was having trouble bringing the severely discharged battery back but a couple days on this and its working decent enough again. The have a proprietary connector so you'd have to get extras/replacements from NOCO but the connectors seem to be better quality.
B004HMBK5G|5|Makes all the difference in the world...my seat belt isn't strangling me anymore!
B001GC2LVM|4|ok
B00AVQSFY6|5|Fits nice and will protect the keys
B00RM327NG|4|I loved this with all of my heart and soul. I always felt like a #BOSS when people would get in my car and see my phone floating in the air. It matched my interior even if I didn't have my phone on it. I could not sing ENOUGH praises about this mount...<br /><br />... Until I took my case off and saw the back of my phone was scratched. You have the option to stick the magnet onto your phone, it's case, or just leave it between the two. For aesthetic purposes I decided on the last. Apparently that's the worst decision, because now my phone has scratches on the back. It's nothing too serious, but it bothers me enough where I feel the need to keep a case on 1000% of the time now. No more naked iPhone joy for me.<br /><br />So my suggestion would be to purchase a back screen protector (they sell those, right?) and hopefully that'll save your phone!
B00GI5SJUY|5|Great and fast
B00CHXBR32|2|This cord was offered as-new for a very good price.  It was well-packaged and arrived promptly.  The connectors are well made, but the outer jacket on the cord was sort of loose and a bit lightweight in comparison to other cords that I have used.  I thought nothing of it, and used the cord without a problem for a couple of weeks.  Then I  had a one-time power supply problem that I attributed to another component in the system.  At that time, I noticed that the recessed  screws on the female connector were a bit chewed up, and attributed this to sloppy manufacturing in China.  While using the cord under moderate loads a few days ago, I lost one side of the 50A supply and the connector melted while still plugged into my RV.  I am lucky that there was not a fire.  I should have followed my original instinct to return the cord when the first problem occurred.  I suspect that I was sold a used cord that had been improperly repaired by someone.  It was too late to return it.
B00MMQRJTA|5|Thank you
B000TRBOK4|3|Larger than I expected.  I need a very small one.
B00NJDF708|3|165$ Beautiful helmet; with that said, it did not come with a visor. I bought another helm from a different company that was 100$ cheaper, even it came with a visor. I had to go to my local motorcycle chop and buy a 12$ visor for the Bell 500. The helm also arrived with a chip and crack in the forehead of the helm. Could have been the shipping, I don't  know, but I have purchased 3 helms from amazon and this is the first disappointment and the most expensive, not sure what to think about that. Had this helm had no chip / crack in it and had a visor, I would give 3 stars. That after a 3 week wait for the large of this helm because they are always sold out. I am not saying don't buy it, its great looking and comfortable and a superior helm in general, I am just disappointed that mine was not up to par with a world leader in helmets.
B0009IQZFM|1|Doesn't absorb as much water as good old fashioned chamois. Worse: Left lint all over my car!  A microfiber cloth shouldn't do that... Going to return it.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|works great on our utv
B00AQAQI6E|5|Look great. Bright white light.
B00AVM3KB8|5|The paint was an exact match to my blue 2011 Escape. The brush is a little cheap but works for small touch ups!
B00192JG9O|4|Made well, is sturdy and met my expectations...would recommend.
B00BDVISH2|5|Old filler cap gasket was so brittle that it snapped in half when I bent it. This got rid of my ongoing oil leak. Had already replaced the valve cover gasket and read about the oil filler cap leaking on another site. Popped in the new gasket and had the oil leak fixed in under a minute.
B000KID31K|5|it works like it should
B00NGOPFE8|5|It was just what I needed, it was easy to put on the vehicle. Works perfectly.
B004R32EPA|5|Easy fit, great quality, could not be happier with this hitch
B004RNRAWW|5|no problems
B000M6ZY7G|4|Seemed a little expensive for a piece of foam, but delivery and product were satisfactory.
B00SRBFYUU|5|Great product
B00D99SZHY|1|this did not fit a 2011 tahoe.
B001U7JTFY|5|Fits nicely
B004940ZNK|5|w=exclellent
B00CJ9O9AC|2|It stopped blinking after a few days. Now just a dim constant glow.
B00D6R5VQW|5|Exactly what I needed and shipped on time!! Thank you!!
B005ESNRL2|5|Hamstar Hoody is on my dashboard in my Kia Soul.  He is cute!
B00C5RBRA8|4|ok
B00YF3GJR6|5|[[VIDEOID:2f5375826ca5986ecdd4d159448dcf4e]]Wow what a fabulous idea , this is a very handy product .This is something everyone should have in your car.<br />This is a great tray you can attach to your steering wheel ,it attaches very easily and is just as easy to remove .<br />It is extremely well made, it is made of high quality materials .It measures 16 x 11 x 4 inches, which is a great size .<br />You can use this as a food tray or as a tray for your laptop or other devices .<br />My thinking behind getting this is for when we go to the drive-in , this is so great for holding all our goodies .<br />We have used it a couple times, and this was amazing .It really did what we needed it for.<br />It is also easy and convenient to store anywhere in your car.We really love ours and you will too.<br /><br />I highly recommend this great tray,I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B000C2YC8C|5|Everything worked out perfectly
B007USCM7E|5|My Sienna 2004 now work well with it.
B00CEXK9TS|5|Fit perfectly
B000QUTQCM|5|Works like its supposed to.
B008LPEZ6Q|4|Not really any different than any other protectant?
B008G248ZC|4|worked great and it was nice to get the old manual mirrors off...thing about ford is the wiring is there...I just went and got the switch for the mirrors from the junkward and hooked these mirrors up and they are just great....beats putting the window down to adjust them.
B009S2V4MY|4|Control arms are very rugged and look good. The only downside is very soft bushings. I highly recommend getting high performance bushings for this or just simply replace the bushings.
B006SYNF9K|5|Folds up nice. Velcro works. Handy that it's double sided.. some days I'm not feelin too safari.
B0009JB7GI|3|It's ok. I'm a otr truck driver it seems like I have to replace fuses all the time.
B00662PHX6|5|Very high quality look and feel. Fits perfectly.
B003NQVDXQ|5|Very easy to install. Looks great on my 2014 Mustang
B009TB9UPW|5|great
B000YMFRW0|1|Too slippery. Required two (2) people to install on a GMC Acadia. Sent it back.
B007Y4UNPW|4|it fit like a glove the first use with it. in the sun and heat though it did shrink like others said. not much for me to said its not worth it. it still is. but when it fit so well the first use or two and then its not as good after that, you know it could be better.
B00H5F3RSU|1|I bought the alloy coated valves stem caps almost a year ago. well, the top round circle on the caps have all oxidized and have turned a red/rust color. the product looked nice but 11 months later I had to replace them with black plastic caps. I would not recommend buying this item.
B00I2XX64E|1|Did not remove a scuff that I had. Waste of money
B0080KITSM|5|Love it!
B0041U90D8|5|cannot tell difference from factory. arrived quickly. installed easily. save yourself 200 bucks, by this one. don't go to dealer
B00S1KEGVU|5|Great!
B0056OFWVM|3|Some nice features... the retractable webbing is very nice. But for a motorcycle get the smaller version. The larger one when it is only let out for a few feet tends to not release. The release position is a full click farther than when the ratchet  handle is down. You can hit the dark handle of the ratchet IF closed and it will most times click down into  the full release position and slack will be give so you can unhook the mechanism.
B0002SQVNA|5|I think this is just as good as Adam's Detail Spray, but better value.  Can't go wrong with Meguiar's, glad I discovered it.
B00120MADM|4|Fits great. Good low cost solution to keep your carpeting clean. The molded lip works to contain any liquid spills. Wish I would have invested in this when I first purchased the vehicle.
713825895X|5|What can I say? It was perfect, shipped fast and worked perfect, now I'm just waiting to see my subie on the sub!!
B007HRJHQ2|5|Fit wonderful and worked out great.
B001JT5OGG|5|Works as advertised. Cut down on sweaty back and seat on really sticky days.
B006FR2G1S|5|First let me start by saying that this is not a high quality item, but really what do you expect for under $20. With that said they aren't that bad, I glued them into the place I want them and I get bad vibrations. If you're looking for a cheap cool looking set of mirrors this is them. If u want top of the line quality, you might wanna increase your budget closer to $50. Seller was very professional and I had a good experience with this purchase.
B0051NN86Y|5|the is a great product, very easy installation
B000CN4XWQ|5|I had some doubts about this product do to some negative reviews I read. I followed the instructions. Took my time to check everything twice, and everything is working as it should. Besides the battery I ran a hot wire off the back of the in car fuse box ( Radio one), and installed a in line 3 amp fuse to the thermostat in the radiator. I found a 10 blade fan on ebay for $30, and it's working beautifully. (Barnett Performance). With the engine off, and the key turned to accessories the fan runs for about 4 minutes is all. I have a 192F thermostat in the engine as required, and everything's the same, and/or a degree or two cooler during modulation of the coolant temperature.  Tip: Turn the fan so the mounting holes are closer to the top, and bottom if your not removing your radiator completely. It makes it easier to reach the mounting rods.
B00YTIEG4A|1|I bought this for my 93 eg hatch. Seat and rails are great, and the seats it self is comfortably good to sit on. But the thing that set me back was the brackets. Brackets fits to bolt it on my car, but to connect it to the rail with the seats it self is soo far off from each other. Too bad i would of liked it on my car. And its been 2 weeks for my return product to happen.
B001BNFY42|5|I'm a Patriots fan, and I love the mats. They look great.
B005SUVQUK|4|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B003E5X4I8|5|Great price for that classic sound. I threw them on my 88 Mustang (5.0 HO w/ smog pump delete and H pipe) right before the rear axle, and finished them with some simple turn-downs. Especially love to hear them cold, they have that beautiful &#34;pop&#34; sound after letting off the gas at 5k RPMs.
B00SH1SN6C|5|Excellent backup battery for the car.  Another car isn't always available for a jump, and this provides peace of mind.  The hard case holds the battery, AC adapter, 12v cigarette adapter charger, microusb cable, and the car battery leads.  The flashlight feature is a nice touch.  It's much brighter than I expected and works in continuous mode as well as a slow strobe mode for visibility.<br /><br />Overall very well made, and the battery holds its charge for a long time.
B007MOACLY|4|Priced too high
B00T62RK1U|4|Awesome. Look great on my cart.
B00NI0S36M|5|A+
B0021UMFF0|5|excellent pump excellent price
B00G0LFTPY|5|Replacement complete. OEM parts fit great. Works and looks better than ever.
B000IYZHNI|5|Great pump..fit perfectly nicely built impressive molding.  Suggest put some gasket cement on first time on Metal (gasket/rubber) attached and included.  Leaked when we tightened it up first time.
B00GKTZAHS|2|Doesn't work well outdoors. Glue is inadequate for exposure to weather. I won't buy this again.
B00GU9WVJI|4|Works great and fit correctly just like the original. No regrets.
B00T9JRLEQ|5|Great
B00G0LFZ80|5|perfect fit
B00CYLHD94|4|The front zipper comes apart. It rides nice and accommodates an Irish Setter.
B00RG9C79U|5|These are great lights that have many applications where you have a 12VDC power source.<br />I used them as extra front lights on my 4x4 and will add more as rock lights under my truck.<br />They put out quite a bit of light.<br /><br />My only complaints is the wires are VERY THIN (as others posted)...would be nice to step them up a couple of AWG gauges, but not the end of the world.<br />Also, be aware they do get quite warm...like, uncomfortable to hold your hand on. I wouldn't mount them to anything plastic that could risk melting or worse...especially if they're going to be left on for more than several seconds.<br />I'm ordering another two pairs!
B001IH8Q0K|5|I bought these at a local big-box store because I needed one for my trailer ball pin... At first I thought the plastic dipped ends were kind of cheesey and all I really wanted was a little pack of plain ones, but the store was out of plain pins. As cheap as these are, the little plastic dipped ends actually make it a little easier to grip and doesn't feel as rough on your hands.<br /><br />For $1.50 I really can't complain, they do as they are supposed to. I just wish they were yellow-zinc coated....
B002LYQALQ|4|This is a one-drop-at-a-time device where I was hoping for more of a constant stream.  I have not used it a lot, but it seems well made and it hasn't leaked.
B004GES6UC|1|This product did not match the image shown for the product.  Furthermore, it did not fit my 2005 Chevrolet Suburban 1500 LT, despite Amazon noting it as a &#34;fit&#34; for my vehicle.  I had to attempt significant modifications to the product via cutting, but it was to no avail.  This was a waste of money and time.  I have since ordered the part from a reputable online seller who has a 100% fit guarantee.
B001GG29QK|5|Perfect! Loved it!
B0097TWG3Y|3|Works great, but small.
B000C6ZI22|5|Saved my bacon. This was a direct replacement for the front section on my 1988 Winnebago Chieftain motor-home. It has a P30 chassis.  I would also recommend buying the replacement connectors for joining the front and intermediate cables.
B00BTLEJXI|5|Great condition great product
B00JIEX722|1|Worked for a day then one kept blinking one and off. Burns incredibly hot for an led. Ended up throwing it out and replacing the blinking one with a regular bulb
B00TIHNPLW|4|Did see anything electronic about it. I have used only once.
B00T4VFH5E|1|I loved this product at first. It worked as expected. Recently I purchased a refill for the freshener disc, and had trouble opening the unit. The lid to the freshener port had melted!! I have pictures to prove it. Do not purchase this item!!!
B0002LBGX2|5|it goes on so easy and you can buff it off just as easy.  It has a silky feel to it.  I paid little more for it than the name brands but, it's worth it!  My 2008 Ford Mustang never looked so good!  Definitely  recommend !<br />UPDATE:  I really do love this wax!  I have a lot of different waxes, sealants, etc and I find myself going back to P21S!  It's so easy to put on and buff off.  I don't know about longevity but, if your going out on the town, your car will shine like glass!  You don't have to apply very much.  Like I said, I find myself going back to this wax to make my car shine!  It's almost like a silky, soft paste wax, so a little more work than a spray wax but not as much as other paste wax's.  P21S doesn't stain your plastics either.  It's like Goldie Locks.... Just right.<br />UPDATE:  I have been using this for some weeks now.  I have to say that out of all the waxes I own,.. Which a lot... I am constantly coming back to P21s.  I even sometimes prefer it to the spray waxes because I can control this better.  It works as good as the paste waxes but is so easy to wipe on and off.  It really shines my car!  If you could only have one wax in your life,  I would recommend this one.  Look at all the 5 star reviews!<br />LAST UPDATE:  BUY THIS WAX!! OMG!! Yes, I had to go there...lol... Again, this wax is in a league of its own.  I feel unless you clay your whole car, this wax is show car quality.  Again, look at the totaltality of the reviews.  92% + love this wax!  I would do a commercial for them.  I read the reviews for products every time I buy on Amazon (current review scandal not withstanding) and this wax consistently receives 5 stars.  Like I said before...Buy this wax, at least once and you will see why all of us are raving about it! Peace
B004ZF3Y40|5|Could not see a night before works great worth every penny. This brand I seem to have better luck with then others
B00J9G6P0K|5|Great gift
B001PNCLHQ|5|The part  came complete and fit perfectly and improved the performance of my Ram Van.
B00A82A4GA|5|It's works great thank you
B006ZJ1YKU|2|Not real happy with the product. Was expecting a much smoother ride but it did not deliver. Only positive was I didn't spend a lot for it
B0006FN1UU|5|I first saw IBIZ at a Camaro Show back in 1998.  I have a black 1995 Camaro...I have been using IBIZ solely since. Even when I had the car repainted,  the painter had major issues removing it.  He asked me what product I was using & instructed me to keep using as he has never seen a wax that offered such protection!  Best as I can also apply at shows , giving people heart failure as I do it in the sun without streaks !!!!!
B00VA1XJ1A|5|It's really worth the price ($5.99) that I paid for it.
B000C5I2YO|5|Covers my worn OEM pad cover pefectly. Easy to install, stays in place.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I love these!  I wish I had seen them sooner.  In the short time I've had them, they've saved me countless times from having to dig between the seat and center console to find my dropped cell phone, credit cards, money, etc.  They installed easily and move well when adjusting the seats.  I am recommending these to many friends and family members.
B007N6YRYO|5|The engine hood on my '97 Explorer XLT would not stay up, so I had resorted to using a prop stick.  I was foraging for parts on Amazon one day, when I happened to see these.  I hadn't really thought about replacing the hood lifts, but the price was very right, so I ordered them.  I then received the email, watched the best installation video I've ever seen (multiple times), and received the parts very quickly.  Had them installed in a little under seven minutes, start to finish (with included coffee break, BTW).<br /><br />Exceptionally well made product.  Fit was exact.  Initially I thought the retaining loop needed to be removed.  Not so.  You just loosen and align it, then pop it over the ball-end of the mount. The only sticky point to the process took about 15 seconds to figure out:  They're new parts, so they were a little stiff getting rotated to the proper orientation.  Otherwise, I have no doubts that these will last longer than the stock lifts they replaced.<br /><br />Great company, great parts.  Will definitely use again.  Highly recommended.
B00SOWKL6Y|5|nice item
B000J2NYUM|5|Great bulbs!!!!!
B0091OE6K6|1|Please dont waste your money!!! It wont last long and its not really working well... It keeps on sliding which brings your seatbelt to its original position. It broke after a month of daily use.
B005LLFQ2A|5|Love it
B001FC34JQ|5|They are very nice just what we orded.
B0009IQUA2|5|Great fit good price.
B00902G378|5|Fit perfect on my 2008 gmc envoy slt with leather power adjustable seats.  All the cut outs are spot on, and it matches the interior trim nicely
B0069S3AWW|5|Very nice addition to my 2015 Durango.
B000A0ILI8|5|Put this on my spare tire on my 5th wheel trailer. Has held up well after 8000 miles of traveling across the country and back. Purchased a second one for my jeep.
B00945SINS|5|Fast and reliable.
B004D5LAFC|5|Looks good car too!
B00KG13FZA|4|Works so far, have had almost a month.<br />Straps went on well, looked difficult at 1st.
B003VCB9WC|5|I used these in my 05 F250 to replace the block coolant drain plugs. They made flushing out the Ford Gold fast and easy. If you're doing the same thing you may want to get a right angle valve for passenger side because it's right on top of the starter
B001MV1LE0|5|Exactly what I needed!  They are wonderful!!
B005G7Y5I0|5|If you have a Brake Buddy you need this. It keeps dirt away from the unit when stored and everything fits inside.
B00S1EPVPQ|5|Good quality filter material and is identical to MOPAR and FRAM.
B006SMFRMA|1|received item in a speedy time. Package was mangled but item was undamaged. Everything about the process was on point (except) item was advertised as Taupe when in reality it was Black.
B0009H51P8|5|great
B00O36DET6|5|Very Nice
B003S9O3TO|5|great
B000CM5CFE|5|Fit perfect for 2002 Saturn SL
B000H961YI|5|good , different from the old one
B00APO8N2I|5|Perfect,Everything was great
B00VITBUWE|4|Excellent bumper! Arrived sooner than promised at fit perfect!
B0014DIK0Y|5|good tool
B000NCV1KS|5|Fits PERFECT!
B002PUTC0M|5|I've been looking for a digital tire gauge that is accurate, easy to read and idiot proof. This is just the correct tool for checking, filling and rechecking<br />The tire pressures on all tires in less that 5 minutes! Awsome.
B0015D19SS|3|not what I expected
B002EXCL62|4|I do a LOT of work on finishes besides just cars.  These work good for most any application.  If you use them often, they don't last that long but then again, they're abused by a variety of liquid ingredients for a variety of purposes.  They CAN be put in the washing machine to get cleaned although they sometimes come with packets of cleaner for on the job cleaning.  I prefer not to do that, but that's just my personal thing.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I was tired of losing earrings, credit cards, keys, etc between the seats. No more, these work great!
B00PGLN4V0|5|What I expected and easy to apply
B00XXLZ5T4|5|Great towels!  Used them twice to clean my car and they do better then the more expensive store bought ones!
B004SRTN3Q|5|Fit my 2011 Nissan Titan Pro4x perfect with the stock battery hold downs so no monkey business. Has the reverse terminals needed for that truck. Great battery
B0016LA5O8|5|Great Product!  Fast Shipping!  Thank you
B0028WNNW0|5|It looks great a holing up good
B003CKQDOM|5|I had to shorten my chain and I forgot to get master links. I bought a standard m-link from one of my friends and ordered these. I had the standard one on for only one month and wore it out. (The posts were so loose they almost pulled out of the side plate) I then checked out the m-link (the correct one for the chain), and it was just like the day I put it in. Great buy! Tough product!
B000VKTUD2|5|WOW! waht a saving for the exact same filter. Fits the original FJ Cruiser filter and a better quality filter.
B00BR05EEY|5|Perfect match- I did not rush, used thin coats of base over several applications before applying top coat. Beautiful result!
B00842A7F4|5|These work and are MUCH less expensive than the dealer. If you take care of your own Honda vehicles they are good to have on hand.
B0058IMW9Q|5|as advertised.
B00T67Q3QI|4|Would encourage a simple wiring guide be added to shipping box as there are two spade connector pins on starter and only one is used for start wire from ignition.
B00ZQ339MM|5|perfect
B000COTX1Q|5|perfect fit , and i would recommend  them to anyone.
B00Y1HQ45I|1|One did not work and the battery was dead in the other one.
B0012RK00K|5|Easy install, works great, great alternative to the factory install
B004BSNNY2|5|worked
B00NB8TGVW|5|I bought these lights for my 02 silverado and they were delivered way before the expected date, and was super easy to install. I only had a few troubles with the size of the bulbs in the door lights, but a few seconds with a file and they fit in just fine. I also was having trouble with the map lights, the bulbs male side was too short to plug in with the cone so it would often flicker when you moved the light on its swivel, but you can file down those too but I just ended up taking them out, it barely changes the brightness of the light and is still way brighter than the factory lights. I had lights to do the whole interior including the glove box light and even the light under the hood of the truck. With a few bulbs left over.
B001B7A2KE|3|It fits in my Ridgeline and works but was not an exact replacement for the OEM and mine make a buzzing noise sound like one of the brushes is rough. But  No worries works fine. Outstanding price
B00RBKREB0|5|Seem to be of good quality. These are soft fenders, and they were already inflated when they arrived.
B001534XCC|5|Perfect
B00G8S07FQ|5|&#34;Ants Korner&#34; ....professional!  VERY Speedy delivery!  GREAT quality!  ***** Five stars all the way!
B006TM1FM0|5|A very good product
B00NBOSI0G|2|wouldn't run, idled but as I gave it throttle it would cut out everytime.<br />No response either from the manufacturer.<br /><br />Don't buy
B006GJYOL0|2|I used this product on my travel trailer for hard water spots. It did not remove spots but did make the trailer a little shinier. I purchased Maguire hard water spot remover and it worked really well.
B000H2W270|4|Works as advertised. Super strong magnet
B00P3FU4EY|1|Do not waste your time or money.  Cheaply made and requires drilling.  Does not even fill the entire console correctly due to poor design (it says the leftover room is for file folders- in 28 years of driving I have never needed a file folder in my vehicle.)  Very disappointed.  Save your money and look at the other options available.
B001NQKHB2|3|the saying says it all
B00412YT8W|5|Works exactly as the factory original.<br />I would recommend this to someone.
B005C57VC8|4|Fit perfectly.
B007CDYX2E|1|It was metal the first time I ordered it and made in USA<br />Now it is plastic and made in Korea.<br />Also wont fit longer than it is supposed to be<br />Dont try to use this on your car.<br />Go get a Fram metal filter.
B001DMDS44|5|Good value
B005GRGOGG|5|Went right in, one wire and BOOM instant ignition! Car runs GREAT and better throttle response.
B00SJBQA06|4|Great for the price. Adapters work poorly to actually keep them from just twisting with vibration and wind. Removed them wrapped the plug in rubber and now they hold perfectly and look great!
B009EABGB4|5|Matches the OEM one that I managed not to break.  Easy to install, power functions work as advertised.
B00CCSD6CW|1|Terrible. It came with creases so it's impossible to put on with no crease line. I would return it but I know shipping is going to cost a lot more then what I bought the roll for ...
B00PJPHEBO|5|Great product.
B001UG8S8O|4|I like it, sticks pretty good. I just figured out I left the outer transparent adhesive layer on in the picture.
B0091DJVK2|5|I have used for two cars and the code readings are very useful. I checked on line for more helpful information and fixed the problem myself instead of pricy dealer's visit. The code reset function is also working great.
B00AR0PCFG|5|I usually don't do reviews but with this product I felt it was necessary, I received the Diablo in about two days and as soon as I opened the box I plugged it in and updated it about an hour later I was tuning my car and damn my Dodge Charger rt is like a whole new beast now
B00R3LYF7S|5|This is great especially with having two children. There's plenty of room for everything and more. When not in use it folds flat for easy storage. The seller is also very nice to work with and quick with shipping.
B00BN46IDA|5|very expensive looking,,  good quality key chain..ive gotten many compliments on it
B001802ELE|5|Looks just like the original
B00CFQU458|5|The part fit my vehicle just as it said it would! Easy to install. Works great.
B00522PH36|4|Super easy to install. This item snapped right in without difficulty. I would have liked a more secure plastic snap but it will still stay in place.
B00LXLKF6O|3|Super rad picture on the sun shade however I wish it was a little bigger. I drive a honda civic and it's a little too small. So I just wouldn't recommend it to someone with a large vehicles.
B00JA3BMDW|5|This thing is sweet, especially for the price. I find myself testing the temperature of all sorts of things - from the surface of frying pans, to coffee, beer, led vs cfl bulbs, brake rotors, my wife, windows, ac vents, etc. It's neat and seems to work great. I guess I'm getting old because these things were unobtainable by common folk 10 years ago.<br /><br />Also, my dog loves chasing the laser light.
B0068C3B3W|4|Forks extremely well on my motorcycle windshield
B004LX14Z2|5|very good item  but not for personal used
B003TLWV40|5|Worked well received quickly
B0009JKI8G|5|I needed to buy new wiper blades for my car when my old ones started wearing out. I usually don't have a particular brand that I consistently buy because I normally go to the store and buy whatever the highest quality blades are at that store, which can vary. That, however, has changed since I searched on Amazon and found these Rain-X Weatherbeater wiper blades with a lot of excellent reviews! I have now had them on my car for almost a month and they are by far the best wiper blades I have ever owned. They were easy to install and the 19&#34; and 24&#34; blades fit my 2008 Ford Fusion perfectly! These blades are also extremely quiet when it's raining out or when you are cleaning your windows with washer fluid. My windows are completely clear after each swipe of the blades with absolutely no streaks. If you use them on a relatively dry window, they squeak a little but nothing like some of the other blades I have owned in the past. I am very confident that these wiper blades will work in the pouring rain or in a snowstorm. The price was also fantastic for such excellent quality wiper blades and I will continue to purchase these so please, Rain-X, keep making them! I highly recommend these wiper blades!
B0076OVSDQ|5|Part was as described. Very simple replacement.  Fast shipping!
B00KRJJ618|5|I like my new black cowboys license plate
B000NVW1LM|1|Tried this product to stop a slight leak of a seal behind the timing cover on my Subaru Legacy. Not only did it NOT stop the leak it actually made the leak a lot worse than it was. This will be the last time I try a mechanic in a bottle....
B00UOBX7N2|3|product arrived in time. installation was easy. looks cheap and time will tell how long it lasts
B00K889FCI|5|It takes more than a minute & a couple of wipes as advertised, but with time & plenty of elbow grease, results are pretty good. I took before & after pics, the remaining oxidation is on the inside of the lenses & unable to be wet-sanded off.  There is plenty of product to go around in one package, so if u have friends who need this, gather everyone together & have a headlight cleaning party to use it up all at once before it dries up!
B00FW1DRZC|5|Great product
B0006VORDY|5|It works very well
B00VNBDWPK|5|Wow, these were easy to install and look great!  I purchased the low beam and fog lights. So far they are awesome !
B004R35HEA|4|Fit correctly and works like it should.
B00UXZY0R6|5|Worked great, easy to program, the hardest part was finding a store to just cut the key.  I had to go to a an actual locksmith. The regular stores, lowes, home depot, ace, walmart, etc. Would only cut the key if they program it.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Cool idea! Love that I don't have to suction cup anything to the windows. Comes off quickly and cleanly in a snap. Good value.
B00THRJZSK|5|Great quality for the price. Slightly large for the truck but that is alright. Arrived on time and in good condition. I may buy a smaller one for my wife's car. I highly recommend if you are in the market for a good car cover at a reasonable price and good quality.
B00N431I2Y|5|Great product
B00LMHP89I|2|Too big
B001NAQT7O|5|I have used k&n products for years. Cant go wrong.
B008CH9JAA|5|Excellent Product
B002KNP0PK|4|Leather is a little bit too rough, and you fill it with your neck, it lacks front air vents, but otherwise it's really good. Removable shoulders, elbows/forearms, back pads, removable liner. Size fits (medium for my 40&#34; chest, 34&#34; neck to wrist). Was already riding it at 76F and it was comfortable.
B003U4LWI2|5|Was a perfect fit in my Chevy Silverado extended cab, very  sleek, comfortable and durable, easy to wash and dry.
B00PC0G07A|5|i had really awful sun rot and had tried other &#34;one size fits all&#34; covers before for my Honda Civic. None fit even remotely. This did the trick and looks/feels fantastic.<br /><br />It took about 2 hours to sew on. I ended up tying the two lengths of twine that come with the cover together and just starting at the bottom and going around. I used the places where the struts coming from the center of the wheel prevent going to the back of the cover to tighten up the little bit of slack by skipping every other hole on the front of the cover and pulling it tight. When the struts weren't in the way, I went through every hole using the row of holes directly below the stitching that the cover comes with.<br /><br />I hope that explanation helps someone else! No instructions with the package so it's a bit daunting at first!
B001DX7EX4|5|Basically a dry K&N, seriously, still has K&N labels on it. but you can oil it at any time.<br />Race performance=dry<br />Daily driver=oil
B0002V9IFU|5|Great product. Much better than leather cleaner wipes that dry out soon after you open them. I used this with a microfiber cloth and it worked really great! My minivan seats are spotless!
B003R3E0JY|2|Did not fit 2003 Jeep Wrangler Sport 4.0 made before 10-2-03. The tube was bent differently and was shorter. It would not clear the factory airbox. The connector to the condenser was the larger tube size. To the evaporator was the smaller size. However, I liked that this hose assembly came with an orifice tube preinstalled. The evaporator connection had three gaskets instead of two. The overall construction of this assembly was really good, it just wouldn't fit my vehicle.
B002FUO3ZG|5|The difference in torque is simply delicious
B00INZ65B2|5|Everything worked out ok!
B00QMTAZ1W|1|Edit****<br />Editing this to do not buy!<br /><br />At first, I thought this was awesome, decided to do some testing and happened to use some lights I had wired up to test how it showed a blown fuse. Turns out that on a 12v circuit, with NO fuse it still puts out about 11 volts. A blown fuse same thing. Granted the light shows that there's nothing in it despite the load or that the fuse is blown, but if you have a valid short, this is a risk. In theory your main power line is also fused, so that should blow as well, but then for every blown fuse you're replacing two and it's still a spark / fire risk.<br /><br />Feel free to test yours with a multi-meter and you'll see that there's voltage on every other lead, with zero fuses in it.
B00FQXKFOC|3|The fittings are fine. The case they are in isn't very good. I had to repair the latches to make it stay shut.
B0041HWHN6|3|Smell is nice, but doesn't last too long.
B00VJ1D34O|5|BEAUTIFUL FINISH, GOOD INSTRUCTIONS & EVERYTHING INCLUDED
B00CWSK5OE|5|A+
B0083KQNBO|4|Got to have them with my old pickup.
B00D8FR34K|4|Arrived before they said it would!! Had to use my old grommets as the new ones did not fit snug. Lights work great and are much brighter than conventional bulbs.
B00OFXGXH2|1|Don't waste your money of time.  Very cheap product.
B008YFH1H8|5|It woke up a few horses in my 1990 convertible mustang.excellent product.
B00CUBEMXI|3|Awesome decal but hard to see on tinted windows.
B000BQW5LK|5|Worked great for the transfer case. was going to use it for the differentials but was able to get bottle in place to fill much faster.
B0077RM6D8|5|They fit my 2012 VW TDI Sportwagen with no problems.  I used them with an adjustable Yakima roof-top carrier for an 8,000 mile road trip with ZERO issues!  They did not detract from my mpg and I don't hear them at all with road-noise, wind, etc.  I haven't even taken them off my car.  I would recommend these and purchase them again for another vehicle.
B009DK64PI|1|Cheap Chinese junk, works but I should have spent a little more for gm keys
B002YKBPXA|5|Solid. Would definitely knock an unwanted intruder out if they enter my house.
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Good product
B00GI77OQ2|5|Seems fine, packaged in a safe and perfect way, no issues here for now
B000JQQQKS|4|Appreciate variety and good price, we will have several uses for these bungee cords. Quality seems acceptable for our use, however they do not appear to be suitable for heavy duty jobs, nor to be extremely high quality.
B005PBIMAE|5|Great product. I've had it for about a month and no sign of fading or tearing or anything.  Love it. highly recommend it.
B0054TR6YK|5|This pump performed great.
B004BTJSD6|1|Does not fit 460 - no bolts or gasket
B005G6J3EM|4|Super cute but smaller than expected.
B00AZ4TZPM|4|Very good
B0049CGJI2|5|Great deal, and fast shipping. Very Happy with my purchase.
B007XOI4XG|5|Comes with double stick tape. Mounts easily and sticks well.
B00029X0YW|5|thanks
B00383RW4I|5|Bought this for use on the bow of my 1996 Yamaha Waveblaster because you need the extra length on this particular unit to extend through the fiberglass in that area. Although I don't use this to actually tie down the PWC, I know I could because it's incredibly high-strength and high-quality. For the bow I use the bow cleat and a ratcheting crank because this unit sits perpendicular to two of my other units on a 3-spot trailer. I also bought another Blowsion eye to use in the stern that is shorter that I combine with a special tie-down for use with certain older Yamaha units. For now, this simply just completes the look I was going for. :)
B006VFLEX0|5|Perfect!
B00PBWSDL0|5|Great set great price great quality and great delivery time very satisfied
B00CHI8ACI|5|Item arrived just as described! Fast shipping!
B001GSEMMC|5|the wife loved it
B00CASDZKC|5|Have them in a Mecedes Benz GLA 250. The seem flimsy but do the job.
B000EIACE2|5|Replaced my squeaky gates belt on my 04 cobra. So far so good. Seems like a sturdier belt than the gates
B005BNZ9UM|5|Use them to stabilize my 5th wheel and they work fine. I like that they stack and belt together when storing. It's less likely that they will blow out of the back of the truck while traveling when belted together.
B00BHZT9DG|5|Works a lot better than the inferior Sirius factory antenna
B005TMIHN6|5|Perfect
B000BK7R32|4|Quick ship, and undamaged good packing 5 star. Ease of installation, no complaints. looks are minus 1 star due to not perfect, but close enough.<br />unlatches and rolls up just as advertised. Tap on it and it sounds like a bass drum. Thought this would be an issue while driving. Not the case. I suggest some felt padding over the clamp bolts so not to rub through the cover over time. They touch. This model was fitted over the bed of a '00 Tundra access cab and fits like a glove. Buy with confidence. The value is spot on.
B000C14FNA|4|It's working good!
B00M9DCMNE|4|Just what I needed
B00PMCIBX4|5|Excelente
B005HYM41C|5|Good quality... Super fast delivery.<br />Thanks
B001GN1NMY|5|Works like it should
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Works great!
B000UFL7D4|4|Mounted under black Tahoe although did not follow instructions to mount high underneath chassis,  mounted sides under floor side panels. Very pleased, effect I was looking for.  ACE hardware has replacement fuses, auto stores do not carry tiny fuse  this system requires, 1.
B00LKF69O0|5|We had to have a dedicated electrical line run to the garage (we live in an older home and the circuit would not support the extra load), but once the plug was installed and we plugged the car in, it's been wonderful.  Unit works exactly as we hoped.  UPDATE 2/23/16:  Very happy with the product - we had a problem with the cord twisting and the company immediately responded and replaced the unit - no hassle.  Major A+ for customer service.
B000N3W8J0|5|Does what you need it to do!  separate your wash mitt in wash bucket, from grit in the water that gets settled down below the guard.
B007BL4WPA|5|Excellent product!!
B00X7W4UA4|5|Works great.
B00MS93F2G|1|Much smaller than anticipated and not for hub cap ones
B005C2AWWM|5|Love them
B000T7HE7Q|5|Good product. Very visible when driving in the day time and night .Only compliant is the hardware. The bolts,nuts and screws have rusted on my pair from salt water.
B005C5AR3S|5|Thanks for the right part, it took a little longer than I plan to receive it, but it's nice to be able to turn off the fuel now.
B000S2ZPXW|5|Love it.
B000C5DM6M|4|Good unit.
B000C5HFCE|1|Very disappointed to find out there was only one tiedown I was under the impression there would be to the description is not very accurate when ordering from my phone.
B00QRE0OOA|4|easy to operate
B000HBNTX2|5|Love this stuff. Your hands have dirt oil paint or whatever on them? this stuff will help you get it off. Pleasant citrus scent as well.
B0006JLW84|5|received vent lids in short time and what I needed.
B00TPQHHLU|5|Great deal
B00ZVMSMCK|1|Not good... after 5 months the brakets cracked and are no longer usable... bad product
B00EDC02IQ|2|The product was decent quality, but it did not meet my (high) expectations.  The instructions were adequate, but the pictures could have been higher quality (not so dark).  If you are mechanically inclined, are comfortable with removing front vehicle fascias, you will have no issues.  If it was half the price I paid, I would have rated it more stars.  I will be returning this product and ordering the genuine MOPAR chrome honeycomb grill inserts.<br /><br />My Concerns/Issues/Observations:<br />I expected the mesh to be a bit heavier gauge/thickness.  IMO, that would greatly enhance the look.<br /><br />I did not care for the fastening method - 16 self-tapping screws with washers.  They would work fine, but you would have to be very careful not to over-tighten and strip them out of the thin plastic of the back side of the fascia.  Screw placement is critical - if you choose a fastening spot in the plastic where the mesh fits tightly against the plastic, you risk having the self-tapping screw going through and penetrating the exterior chrome bezel.  If I engineered this product, I would have designed spring clips to be inserted into the existing slots that were used by the OEM grill inserts.<br /><br />I was going to use stainless steel wire instead of the screws, looping it through the mesh, into the existing slots and around the plastic of the inner fascia.  After positioning the mesh grill, it did not align symmetrically within the seven openings.  Side to side alignment was fine, but top to bottom was not.  The entire mesh grill would need to be moved down 1/8&#34; - 1/4&#34; and this could not be done due to inner plastic fastening tabs being the stopping points for the grill to move down.  A solution would be to remove the outer rubber tubing of the mesh grill on the bottom edge, trimming the mesh, and reinstalling the rubber tubing.  If I liked this grill better, or if it was less costly, I may have done this.  Perhaps I am too much of a perfectionist because Inoticed the symmetric misalignment - others would not notice this, or may not be concerned.<br /><br />This is a one-piece grill.  Having individual inserts could allow for a better securing method, utilizing the OEM grill insert slots.
B0007TR4CQ|5|Solid and wide. Great piece of mind whenever I'm under my car.
B00O7ZAD6U|5|looks great and fit good
B00429NKWK|5|used before , excellant job.  Makes headlights likenew.  Gave to grandsons for first cars.
B000CNAO9W|5|Just what was needed
B00G1XB8O2|5|Pathway works great right out of the box! Getting the receiver activated was more difficult. After you activate the receiver if you keep getting error 129 call dish and talk to the dish doctor. It will save you time and frustration.
B000E65NHK|1|The fuel module sucked. electrical connector didn't match.
B00802GIW4|5|Product as described
B00029WSWW|4|easy to install, just what my wife wanted!
B00QU9538Y|5|Easy to install. Great improvement over OEM bulbs.
B001GN6SE2|5|worked perfect!
B0049EFKJY|5|Perfect
B00IUWLZMW|3|Battery came packaged well and no damage to the box. Had a good charge on it. Fit right in and worked as it should. I think the meter on it is a nice gimmick, but cannot see it when installed unless I pull things apart to access it. Have only had it installed for about a month, so I cannot speak for how long it might last. If it lasts long enough, as in 2-3 years like most bike batteries seem to last me, I would give it a full 5 stars.
B005WRABPU|1|Caused my 2008 Tiburon's engine to bog and stutter. Took it out 30 mins after I installed it. Replaced it with the OEM replacement and was smooth as silk
B008UCY0LA|5|Product & delivery time as stated.  Pleasure doing business. Thank you.
B00DBEQC3G|5|As expected
B000CMF5ME|4|I had to make nylon washers to fit in the outer recesses of the stem hole. The chrome finish washers supplied were far too big. I had to enlarge the inner holes on some nylon washers from the hardware store, that work even better than the chrome ones would have ( had they fit ).. Still look great on my American Racing aluminum rims.. Nice product for the price.
B00PSD5O28|1|3 out of 3 that I have gotten went bad in less then a months time and all you sevice people could do is give me a discount on another order I don't think so specially after haven so much issues as it is
B000CMDMPQ|1|The worst sprayers ever. Leaks all over your hands. The cleaner didn't work, used simple green instead. I'd give it zero stars if I would.
B00KVPTYLA|5|fast shipping, good price
B003WOIT04|1|2/3 of this order worked however the critical piece that opens the flush ball did not function due to the cam not being long enough to open the flush ball. Because I delayed replacing my flush ball until I could get to this project I am not able to return this product.
B003YBMDRU|1|unfortunately these where placed in the back of my 80 series cruiser that rarely gets driven. One started leaking gas out a seam in the bottom and ruined my carpet, and my driveway. haven't been able to drive the cruiser since i found the leaking can because of gas fumes. now amazon says i can't return the defective can. wish I would have caught the leak before it drained all two gallons!!!!! what a pain
B004INIDM2|2|The passenger and dogbone were good quality and fit as they should although the dogbone needed some tough love to seat into place. The drivers side was the wrong part and I had to go buy one at my local parts store since I already had the car ripped apart.
B00076WQBS|5|Easy installation
B009VYWIMO|5|Product was as described, well worth the money and working really well.  I am pleased with my purchase
B000WJX4BQ|5|got ten years from last one  Grate batterys
B0034BR4VA|3|Bought it for a friend
B004OFNJZ0|5|Fits perfectly for my Vibe and stores away conveniently between the seat.
B0001CMUV4|5|Power chair/scooter lift on the back on my truck has a pull out arm that make the whole thing tilt to the pull out side.<br />It's now level and has zero wobble.<br />Took less than five minutes.
B00BXVOIVW|1|This was very disappointing as it never worked.
B000C57KCE|1|I purchased these struts and my husband ( an ASE certified tech) installed them at his shop. After about 8 months I started to hear a clunk when turning the wheel at low speeds. I told my husband, who looked at them and didn't see anything wrong at the time. Yesterday afternoon I went over a pavement seam and heard a loud bang, then my car started to pull to the left. I asked my husband to look my car, and he discovered that both upper strut mounts had shattered! For what these struts cost they are complete junk! I have to replace both struts after only 8000 miles! Junk!
B000NZOH7E|3|Made good, not best fit for the 2009 Chevy extended cab.
B00XZ9O590|5|Was able to have a locksmith cut and program this key to a 2004 acura TL in less than 10 minutes for $30. Much better than paying the dealer $230 for a new key and programming. A special scan tool is required to program the key to the vehicle, and only some locksmiths have these tools. With a little shopping around you should find someone who will do it at a good price.
B00CHDDVG8|5|Thanks
B004M1YG4O|5|Tanners leather conditioner best on market. Brings cracked leather back to new life.Keeps leather soft and supple when used regularly.
B00PDSJ32A|4|It's pretty good. Battery could last a little longer but otherwise I'm happy
B004WMDVDU|5|The insert fits perfectly in our 2004 Envoy.  The design by GM is a little faulty, in that, the cup holder was never designed to accept the size of drink containers that are available at the Convenience Stores.  The containers either will not fit in, or if forced, are nearly impossible to remove without destroying the drink container.  This is, I believe, how the original insert got &#34;lost'.  The insert fits the console securely and with the proper size drink container, holds it quite securely and removes easily.  The insert arrived on time, and was securely packaged to protect it.  Should you find that you also threw yours away, this insert is of good quality, and fits the console at least as well as the factory original.  I've recommended these to friends and relatives who have managed to toss their originals out with the drink cup or container.  Thanks
B00OBRCAWY|3|My girlfriend ordered this for her Chevy cruze and here's her review &#34;its like fine if you don't grip it too hard because its not that tight and will slip off, so I guess it depends on you but I'd give it a three star rating&#34; so there's that!
B00FLFZ5NG|5|Perfect fit. Works great!
B000CIUOMY|5|must have for tire mounting
B002ZTGLCK|5|a+
B00873J0YY|4|Would be better if quick release.
B00B0DGRF8|1|Way to small seem like children's glasses
B0018A87A6|5|A fun way to remember which key is which.
B000WZ4KBS|5|Just like the description said so A++++++.
B003ITOQ0U|4|Isn't the model I thought it was from images (ultra Thin Carbon-Fiber) and images are misleading by not fully providing disclosure of inner liner thickness.
B000C5G42G|5|Fits like a glove on my 92 Toyota P/U.
B000GKD5PQ|4|I've owned two of them as the first one just &#34;fell apart&#34;. Good enough and cheap enough to buy again.
B00ADECCAE|5|Fits 2015 Honda Civic perfectly. Looks really good!   The original wheel covers were held on the steel wheels by the lugnuts, so I had to remove the lugnuts first. I removed the Honda wheel covers & then reinstalled the lugnuts, after which I snapped on the black wheel covers onto the wheels.   Highly satisfied!  The set comes with rings that lock the covers into place. You can adjust the tightness of the rings by moving them more inwardly behind the wheel covers, so they won't fall off while you're driving.
B010Q4PW4S|5|HERE IS ALREADY AFFIXED TO MY CAR
B004A6DVFQ|5|Fit and function is perfect. Like all the other Wagner products I have used.
B006LVXRPM|5|Fits just like OEM.  Good price - fast delivery.
B0049HRJWW|5|So far so good. Kinda skeptical since this is the 3rd one on this vehicle.
B00ATTQWZY|5|Prefect kit
B00HVHFYJ2|5|Key guard works great!
B00X7HS5LY|4|This sunshade is pretty well made and large enough to fit most car windows, however, the measurements for this shade are incorrect. It comes with a sleeve to store it in as well, which is a nice idea, but the sleeve fits so tightly around the folded shade that I would only put it in the sleeve if I weren't planning to use the shade again for a long while. If I'm constantly getting in and out of my car while shopping, I don't want to take the time to struggle slipping it into its storage sleeve every time I get into the car. The shade does have an elastic strap to keep it folded up if you don't use the sleeve.<br /><br />The material this shade is made out of I think would hold up well unless stabbed with a pointy object. It's definitely a better material than the value-brand sunshade I'm currently using in my car. I also find that it's easy to fold compactly. I've had folding shades like these in the past, and some of them just don't want to pop back into a compact size.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the measurements of this shade are not the same as the measurements listed for this product. The product listing says this shade is 70&#34; x 35&#34;, yet in reality it is approximately 70&#34; x 31.5&#34;. I returned the first shade I got, because I thought I had received the wrong item, but the replacement I received was the exact same size as the first. For many this slight difference in size won't matter, and may even make it fit better for some vehicles, but my Honda Accord EX Coupe needs it to be 35&#34; from the bottom of the windshield to the top in order to stay up under the sun visors. It fits just fine across the windshield though. Considering the company has a photo on this listing that says to &#34;measure twice, order once,&#34; I would think that the measurements they provide would be accurate.<br /><br />I've added some photos that show the measurements of the sunscreen I received and a measurement of my windshield. I've also added a photo that shows how far up my windshield the sunscreen goes when placed inside. It doesn't even reach the sun visor.<br /><br />If your car's windshield has measurements that are 70&#34; x 31.5&#34; or smaller, I would really recommend this shade as it is really nice, despite not working for my car. If your car is not as wide as 70&#34; across it can be squished together more to fit, which is useful.<br /><br />I received this product for free to test out and provide an honest/unbiased review.  The discount did not influence any of my opinions of this product.sunscreen goes when placed inside. It doesn't even reach the sun visor.

B00JF5VYSI|5|worth it,,,,
B008MISDH4|5|I use this oil in my Yamaha FZ6R and seems to make the shifting smoother than the Yamalube oil. The full synthetic is more but the way to go. I am going to get this for my spyder as well, in 5w40
B004131JHK|5|Looks much sturdier than the poorly-engineered one I pulled out.
B0049J8V2W|5|Fits like it should at a fraction of the cost of OE. Time will tell how long it will last, I have no reason to believe there will be any problems.
B0006SH4KU|5|Before this I've been using Windex like a noob on my car window on my old car. Found out not too long ago that it was not the best thing to be cleaning your car windows with (since it contains ammonia - which can damage your plastics and trims). Now that I have a new car, I've pretty much looked into the details about cleaning things correctly.. and here I am. So this is basically what I'm comparing it to.. Windex.<br /><br />First impression - after diluting it properly and using it, it smells great (kind of like bubble gum to me.. Don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing). After a couple of uses, I notice that it's pretty good at getting rid of bird poop and small insect remains without having to respray the area (used a microfiber towel to clean). Results: windows are streak-free, clear, and no sign of leftover residue. Plus, the smell doesn't linger.<br /><br />To be honest, this is a whole lot of product. 1 gallon might be overkill if you are using it by yourself. I have started using it 2 months ago, and have not made another dilution yet for a 16oz bottle. So this is going to last me a while, which is nice I guess.
B002EO2AW6|5|Autobots ready to roll out.
B00BWVY5I4|4|First pair sent were different, One fitted, other one didn't. Supplier sent thru another correct part. Perfect! Only down side was the waiting in between shipments.
B007W5DLXE|5|Very good set.
B006JPEAAQ|4|It's just as good and at the full size as a more expensive Monokey case.  My thing is why pay twice as much more for a piece of molded plastic? The decals I got with it did not stick and &#34;blew off&#34; after my first ride, it looks better without the decals anyhow. I use it a lot and would be lost without it but if I had to do it over again I would get the bigger, flatter 52 liter box that a pizza box could fit but I didn't want a top case much wider than my bike cause I have a narrow space in my garage to park my bike and was afraid if the sides were too wide I would hit it off the wall and crack it, plus too wide of a box just doesn't look right on the back. I wrote this review long after my purchase cause I was in here shopping for a new or bigger top case but after reading my own review I convinced myself I am better off keeping this top case cause a new one won't be much better than what I have now.
B00KA137CC|5|Fit and looks great.
B000CM0WW2|5|This fit my '98 Windstar, and installation could not be easier.  Two adhesive pads are included with the mirror (the factory mirror used one pad, which  failed, allowing the mirror to fall), and securely held this mirror to the powered frame.  The great price was a bonus.
B00MVMRPWG|4|This little led screws are bright. Havent tested if waterproof, but they can go anywhere. And they can hook up almost anywhere . I wouldve left 5 stars , but they managed to slip in a different led color . I ordered them all in silver and i got a black one in one package. Wires are really small, but decent length
B002LGP5LU|5|Solid
B006B2Z588|5|Fit my 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly!  I did not see the cover for the sun shield on Amazon, so I call Covercraft.  The mailed one out to me for $5.71, shipped FREE.  Great product, and a great company.  I bought one of these for my new 2003 Chevy Tahoe years ago.  I still use it regularly, and it looks like new.
B00MY4ND9U|5|These were sold cheap, its price right now is higher, but i'ts still cheap compared ;  I used EBC , akebono, Hawk. Centric, Bendix but these never until now bec. of the price these days of this brand. I know this'll be good bec/ it's a Bosch. If not I'll come back and correct<br />my opinion  as well as I  can.  and eat dust.
B0024ECBCA|5|This regulator is a must have! With the automatic switch over feature and built in fuel gauge it make using my Ice Castle fish house so easy. One bit of advice, if you do buy this,  make sure to order a second Pigtail hose. I didn't realize I needed one until the the new regulator came and had to wait another couple days to use it.
B00OVBTN2U|5|LEDs plug in no problem and are very bright.  Important to note is that light from an LED is directional, so while these bulbs may work well in one application in another they may not be as good.  I'm using these as third brake lights on a 2004 odyssey and 2004 civic SI and they work great in these fixtures.
B000RNU42Y|5|Installed on and 05 Ford Freestyle wagon.  Very good design - sets right up under bumper and is very inconspicuous.  A little difficult pulling the bolts from inside the frame.  Also came with extra bolts which confused me and I used the wrong bolt inside the frame and had to abandon it but was able to rebound with the correct bolt.  (Word of caution).  The paper instructions are good but also recommend that you watch the youtube video before installing.
B00173U7D4|5|I am allergic to artificial scents, this is totally fine with me.<br />refreshing smell
B0010G9WMA|5|worked great and fast delivery,
B000C5449G|5|Work like a charm and you don't need a torque bit to install them.<br />Much heavier duty than the OEM version and will hopefully last longer as well
B000C9XZEM|5|A good deal for a name brand filter.
B006EMVN72|5|Fit as promised on 2005 Silverado.
B011B2BYAU|5|Very pleased
B001JQCCFK|5|Fun!
B000SL4AA2|5|Not used it yet. Appears okay
B000TYFWY6|5|Worked great on a 2006 Dodge Grand Caravan. No more tracking down someone to press/pump/hold the brake pedal.
B006SYNF9K|1|Does not help at all
B0050H396U|5|As other reviews stated there are no instructions on the assembly of this item but if you can tie your shoes and know the difference between a screw and a bolt you should be able to assemble this product with no problems. Product arrived quickly and each tube was covered in plastic. No scratches or defects on mine and looks just as good as other high dollar fork stands. Has a very nice sturdy feel, maybe I got lucky or others didnt assemble theirs properly but like I said, if you have basic mechanical abilities this is a breeze for you. Holds up the front of my 04 600rr with no problems. Just remember the rear tire needs to be lifted first
B000C2WI7O|5|working great after a few months. Quality product.
B00515NICG|5|Bosch quality, no problem
B000QH3YFK|5|This is an official Nissan product and is very sturdy, not  a cheap piece of tin. The black is a matte finish which looks better that the gloss in my opinion. A very nice product.
B00HP1DPKE|5|Excellent product, excellent price
B00UXUXUZE|5|Decent price, fast shipping. just found out vw appoved top spec 4200 as 507.00.
B00T9AGBOQ|5|Great product:
B0081HUZMW|5|These block off plates work great on my 2012 Kawasaki ZX6R.  Perfect fit, high quality, and smooth finish of these really dresses up the engine area, unfortunately you rarely see them.
B0043000G2|5|👍
B007C3CP7Y|5|Very good construction. Sturdy.
B0093NAAY6|5|True Plug-and-play solution.  Works perfectly in mu '09 Odyssey and stows neatly in the jack compartment when not in use to keep it out of the elements in winter.  In the instructions are minimal, but the only real &#34;missing&#34; fact in the &#34;pull the panels back&#34; point is that the cargo-net holders are threaded and need to be screwed out before you can snap out the panels,
B008LY1C8Q|5|The starter fit perfect and works great. Ed

B002Y079XK|5|looks great on my mud flaps , stays on great

B000C7YRNM|4|Good
B0041U6MLQ|5|It fit & worked Perfect
B0000BVEKC|5|It works great. Very satisfied with it.    Thank you
B0053GL5DM|3|OK, but they need a better guide to stop the strap from becoming misaligned in the buckle. Hard to complain about the price, though.
B00IJSWPVM|1|Cheap quality. Made for kids.
B0000AXQN1|5|Works as it should.
B0002MG9TC|5|Arrived in excellent condition.  This product has meant my expectations.

B00IAIG878|1|I could not use the whole roll as it was damaged about 15 inches from the end so I could not complete my project.
B00KXHJLIW|5|Fits perfect. Super comfortable and doesnt burn your hands when you car has been sitting in 100+ degree weather all day
B00E0S7IFS|5|Arrived quick , fit perfect.
B00IKPF5FC|1|defective out of the box.......hazard switch turns on/off randomly....half the cruise functions do not work at all.....horrible build quality......should have stayed in China.....removing and reinstalling these switches is an annoying and time consuming task, having to do it again and again because of extremely poor quality is never acceptable.....no more!...I just ordered the AC Delco factory replacement which costs alot more but is actually cheaper because it will work right away and last far longer........this was the third time I have installed multi-switches in Buicks, 2 were defective immediately and one just didn't last for long.....AC Delco is the only one I will use anymore
B00AUFMB8Y|5|Perfect for my new Sienna.
B00CBQFE8E|1|does not work on 2012 ford fusion. Called tech support and they said they are having trouble. If tech support knows that why are they selling them.
B00HQZVDFI|5|Work great.  Good upgrade to our Escape.  Installed by our Ford dealer.
B001BDPGCM|4|Great product, great price. I put this in my Bronco and no more engine miss and quick throttle response.
B004RNOVTM|5|Good quality hose and the perfect length
B0007PHD0S|5|Followed the instructions (kinda), worked as advertised. It is better to remove the drain tube at the evaporator connection and spray directly than going up the drain tube. Product works great. Remember to turn your AC off 5 minutes before you turn off the car to prevent bad smells from coming back.
B000N9NAO6|3|A well made gasket but the description of where it went needs clarification
B0101A0C38|5|It's great, getting lots of comments and starting conversations about change for the better.
B00HCTIW0W|5|Great buy and quick delivery
B007O0V21U|5|Excellent. Would do business again. Thanks for the great product.
B00296B8XQ|5|Worked as advertised!
B00JJQ65JG|1|The stickers are cool but the shipping is more then the sticker  even in bulk the shipping is half the price of the product
B00BYH6C1E|5|This has saved me from &#34;losing&#34; my keys and multiple items.  Could've have used this years ago!
B005GVU8OG|5|Works great and installed easily with all the hardware provided.
B000WJXFHO|5|Can't go wrong with the brand and it's made in the USA.
B002DZJQ0A|5|Great purchase, quick delivery. Thank you.
B00GZLMEPM|5|Worked as advertised!
B00D1CQVIY|4|the wire is only about 4 or 5 ft long not long enough to reach from back of a 17.5 ft bass boat where the batt`s are to the front but i was able to add more wire easly would have been nice if the wires were longer
B00BI3SS7U|4|Was what I wanted
B004QC9072|1|This product is mis-marked! It does Not fit a 42RE transmission or a 40RE transmission as listed. The correct part is a # 65113 Dorman or equivalent. Much smaller in diameter and longer by almost an inch.
B006DY2ZWS|5|Same as original equipment on my 2012 Taurus SHO, these came with new caliper slides but not with lubricant like the front pads did.
B0002F6804|1|I tried using Atwood tech just ask, so i explained my problem put my credit card no in (i hate to do) suppose to be for a good faith $5 deposit i have not heard anything so dont use this bs site
B0033DKLX2|5|Fit my 2008 F150 like the original part I replaced it with.
B00KSD47IU|5|Exactly what I was looking for at a very reasonable price.  People should know that when you program the remote, that if you currently have another that you use like I did, you need to program the other one at the same time.  If you do not, it will not work.  Very happy with the product.
B005SUTKUI|1|Did not function properly out of the box. Gauge wouldn't hold air and would bleed air out while taking pressure on the tire stem.
B004C6BAPC|5|Fast delivery, good deal!
B00ZECEDBQ|5|Fast shipping and great quality!
B000C9GO8G|5|working so far
B000GASY8E|4|ok
B0022ZS4RM|5|Best oil on the Market,Shame you cannot Buy it Anywhere even though the factory is 25 miles away  :(
B004QHOOE6|4|Great lug nuts.<br /><br />Beware, these lug nuts are cone seated with a 60* taper.<br />If you plan to run this on your OEM rims, be sure to purchase a taper-to-ball seating washer to reduce wear and tear.<br /><br />Reviewed by a Whale.
B00S1U5TWA|5|I like to compare different car care products, old vs new, high price vs med priced chemicals. But these towels and the rest of The Rag Company car care detailing microfiber products are second to none. Price point and quality, look no further just keep buying them.
B00CRR5KXG|5|:)
B000L9AD2K|4|Perfect for my truck nice and tiny yet still powerful enough to fill the tire with no problem. downside is it just takes a little long then gets a little warm
B0050NOTG8|4|Bought these for my 2015 Silverado double cab.  Install was easy.<br /><br />Was able to only use three of the four brackets on each side instead of four.  If one of them had been reversed then it would have fit great.<br /><br />A little bummed that the chrome coated pieces were not one piece for each side as there is a seam about half way on each side.<br /><br />Over all very nice product!
B004A6B91E|1|Main O-ring leaked immediately on 3 pumps we bought. DO NOT BUY
B004GE69EW|1|Don't waste your money on this
B00YML13OU|5|We're very glad we bought these magnets!  We put one on each side of the car when our daughter who's just gotten her permit is driving.  She was very nervous to drive because of all the crazy & sometimes rude drivers.  These magnets help her feel better about driving because most people leave a little extra room & are generally more considerate.  She has had people blow past her in no passing zones even with the magnets but that's real life driving.  If you're thinking about using them at night just know they don't reflect as well as we expected especially since the picture of the products says &#34;highly reflective&#34; right above it.  We keep them on our refrigerator so they're easy to grab no matter which car she'll be driving. All in all we're glad we bought!
B002MEJB1Q|5|Love the design of this car trash bag. It lies flat against our car door. Holds a lot. Easy to empty.
B000RN4FK6|5|I have had this product on my motorcycle for 3 months now. I have load it with heavy items and large items. It stands up well. I also ordered the single bag that matches and goes over the fender. It is well worth the money.
B00DJ4FIPQ|5|I love Valvoline Racing oil for all my hotrods
B00C5M1R62|4|I'm happy of this kit.
B000C9WJ3A|5|Do it yourself and save with this filter.  Super easy...just took mere minutes!
B000C15DYA|5|Everything fit perfict
B007OCGCIQ|5|Awesome
B0006IX7UQ|5|Just what I wanted.
B009OBW5S6|3|ok
B0002NYDZ8|4|good heavy duty build. Expect it to last me a while. Great product
B000CB5BH4|5|worked well
B00BIA2LJY|5|Would Buy again
B00T52P58G|5|Rack works.
B00FWP8QBS|5|It fitted exactly!
B00JRE38EA|5|Best deal for the price.  Installed these in my boat instrument cluster for a quick LED look and they work well.  Nice and bright, and color is right, and light is well diffused.
B00HAPISP2|5|Worked great for my 2000 Maxima
B00X808U74|5|Excellent product. My car (Volvo s40 2004) works excellent. The check engine light immediately turned off.
B00G0ZORNK|5|Great fit for 2007 XC90 sport. Looks exactly like the original and install was easy thanks to the link that one of the customers left on amazon reviews.
B005SB6S3Y|5|as advertised
B003FPF22I|5|bright light like them
B009DJYJEC|5|looks good, had a razor knife cut look in the fog light area. did not complaine, minor Ill fix
B0002MBKD2|1|cover is bigger than steering wheel and so it moves freely when you are turning the wheel unless you squeeze it tightly....can be very dangerous if you have to turn suddenly....have contacted mfg and still waiting for a reply....hope they will replace it with one that fits the wheel tighter.
B008DBK314|1|gmc frame has a curve, these brackets don't conform. I like the CURT 16418 Fifth Wheel Custom Install Kit
B0095TC6I6|5|First things first--all clip on or strap on mirrors have the potential to shake.  What determines this is how stable your mirror is.  If it moves even a tiny bit by hand, it will definitely shake.  You are adding mass at length that must push air.  No main mirror movement?  No shake.  I would suggest finding a way to stabilize your mirror.  I purchased these for my Ford Expedition as there was no factory style towing mirror available.  The way they mount is far easier to handle than anything with straps or brackets.  Very easy to adjust.  Now that I have them adjusted, I handle them with great care when storing them to make sure they are 100% dialed in when I put them back on.  It takes under a minute to re-install them and I'm ready to go.  There is a slight distortion at the very edge of the mirrors, which is common in a lot of towing mirrors.  This doesn't cause any issue with use, but know it's going to be there.  They look great and are adjustable in a way that I can now comfortably see more of my blind spots when towing my 30 foot Passport.  No regrets!  EDIT:  Mirrors are still great!  I have included a picture of the not so attractive shims that I use to stabilize the mirrors on my 2013 Ford Expedition.  It is just a suggestion, as again, if your mirror housing moves even a little the Grand Aero mirror will too.  This is not a knock on Ford, just on the design of their main mirror.  Good Luck to all and happy trailering!
B000O846UI|5|OTC is a quality tool!!
B00HJ6O4A0|5|Handy mat easy to clean and fold/unfold.
B001F0MHV4|4|Works well. Have used it all summer now. Would give it 5 starts, but it is fading and fraying a bit around the edges.
B002VISH7C|5|It's slightly slower then the factory unit, but that may just be the new one needs to loosen up.
B008JORKP2|5|The burner is everything we had hoped for and more.  It came in very handy for atmosphere as well a cooking in a couple of instances.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to others.
B000GU7I72|4|Is good unit. Fits my vtx 1800.
B00JQY1ZJ6|4|It keeps good time, but the control buttons are too sensitive.  Any touch changes the time or functions.
B000IYI9X8|1|After buying this new cardone cv axle I decided in the future to only go with rebuilt or genuine axles. I hope I am the odd man out and just received a lemon but the holes for the dowel pin on my axle were not machined in the correct spot and I was not able to get the pin thru the shaft to secure the inner cv. The axle I received is also much heavier and designed slightly different then OEM. I ran up to the parts house and grabbed a remanufactered axle and it slid right in no issues at all..
B009A6EACE|5|Excellent thanks
B007I84KRQ|5|I couldn't have been happier with this plate. It's heavy, of great quality and looks simply amazing!
B007GRYUHO|5|Awesome design, very easy to apply on to car, have washed many times and the stickers are still on there and not ruined one bit.
B008KKN4EQ|4|first one I bought came without the clips. had to exchange it.
B000FQ0HOS|5|It fit just right but with the new windshield frame you may have to do some grinding to make if fit right
B00873J0YY|1|Poor design! If your cargo rack is not high enough from your vehicle's roof, the bolt securing the carrier to the roof rack digs into the roof when the kyak is mounted. The weight of the kyak causes the bolt to make contact with the roof.
B0108U7XVA|5|all bulbs work great, good service
B000CLPDRC|5|Hawk stopping power with less brake dust.
B00TS9ZWAW|5|Great product and deal on the 5w-20<br />My car calls for either 0w or 5w.<br />By using the 5w I save about $8 over the 0w per 5qts<br />I'm well advised in synthetic oil so nothing new but it's barely more expensive than<br />conventional oil.<br />Bottles are very robust and well sealed.
B003EOVFGM|5|Very easy to install! There is little change to the ride quality and it seems to handle better.
B00JTRFTZQ|5|Fit perfectly, looks great
B00BCRMB34|3|They say it fits universal seats, however it doesn't fit my Ford Expedition at all, I couldn't even get the top cover down halfway. The material leaves a little to be desired, it's sort of thin and a bit plastic-y feeling? I am in the process of trying to return mine, unfortunately I have not have a response from the seller yet. Would be good for someone who doesn't have heavy use of their car seats or just wanted to protect them for a weekend trip.
B00UM9XBZK|5|high quality, easy to read gauge set and simple installation. the perfect addition for my 56 chevy.
B001PNG7I0|5|best o.e. part and price
B00BQGIWCK|5|Perfect fit, swapped out in seconds!
B00RYFM3AE|5|They work perfect
B009AEO52G|5|Worked great
B00W6J08ZK|2|The product looks great but the adhesive that holds them on isn't very good.  Even after cleaning the surface area very well before applying the vents to the car and allowing time to dry it still didn't stick very well.  That is my only complaint but still a major one since this thing is no good if it won't stay on the car.
B00W4XNQ16|5|Key chains are sturdy and seem durable. They have a ring that is easy to get keys on and off of, and big enough to hold a large set. Would recommend.
B002PQU6ZQ|3|Still not fixed
B00T9BJ2GE|5|A  great led light for the money, fast shipping and very well made.
B00HTP8N0I|5|Nice
B00V4H30M8|5|It was good product But it just did not fit
B001YJFUIS|5|Nice
B00CODCOTQ|3|Good fit cheap ties on the side both side cords broke when I tried to tighten them up.
B00B62MCRU|3|Disappointed in the fit. They are too short both in the front and rear allowing carpet to be exposed. Great quality and design but fell way short as far as coverage.
B002NFUNHA|5|Excellent, the only assembly grease that I know of that dissolves when the engine is started.
B007H8DKJG|5|great reasonable price
B003TKVU98|5|Best out for the price.
B000K02EDG|5|great
B008G2ZNWY|4|Perfect fit and solid quality.  Very nice looking too.
B001KSCF0E|5|DIY for replacing a damaged mirror, it fits perfectly. Saved a lot of money from going to the mechanic.
B004GMSL18|5|nice item ,but didn't work on my 2002 mustang convertible
B00WPHXQ8Y|5|good buy;looks fine on my car
B002CV1IQU|5|Look really nice on my 02 Yamaha V Star 1100
B00CO2YLRU|4|helped in a pinch
B001KSCSQU|4|Good
B00F66Z1H0|5|Worked perfectly, fit great.
B00H8DOJR2|5|They work perfect. Had them for a few months now and theyre still good.
B00BMDZHH0|5|Product matched size and appearance of the OEM emblem on CVPI. Arrived and was as described, very pleased.
B000WOES8Y|5|Superb item. I was able to get it lined up just right and the adhesive has worked really well so far. We'll see what a couple rides in the heat will do as far as longevity of the adhesive.
B00C8VF9QE|5|There really isn't much to say about this.  They work like their are supposed to.  They were installed in a trailer to hold specific items.  Next time I would get the longer pieces that would span two wall rails in the trailer.  I think that would make it stronger and a  little more useful in the long run.
B002N2T3OM|5|Excellent product
B00FFIZ516|3|Not what I thought it would be so I could not use this for what I needed looked good just not for me
B005MZXZ3C|5|Great quality product and easy to apply!
B0009V1WR0|4|Sometimes the key is hard to get into the hole, perhaps a side effect of anti pick locking internals. Should work well though, I couldn't see how anyone could get this off without an electric saw
B0049GLHB2|4|This review will be about the product itself, but I just want to give credit where it's due to Amazon for exceeding expectations in customer service.  I ordered it and selected Prime two day free shipping.  On the day it was supposed to be delivered, FedEx determined that it was damaged and they weren't going to deliver it so started routing it back to Amazon.  I needed this part that day so I contacted Amazon.  Instead of refunding my money when it got back to them and making me place another order, they were able to get another one out overnight, without additional charge, and gave me a $5 off coupon on my next purchase.  Less than 24 hours after contacting (about 22 hours) them, I had my part delivered.  This is why I order through Amazon.  That, and the part was 50% cheaper than any of my auto parts stores.<br /><br />Now, to the part, which is what reviews are supposed to be about.  The radiator came beautifully packaged in double cardboard boxes and completely undamaged.  All of the connections were an exact match with the original and attached perfectly.  I would give this item five stars but I had one issue. Four mounting bolts we kind of a pain.  Unlike the original part that had the nut welded to the frame of the radiator, these were threaded clips that attach to the sides and are therefore able to move.  And they did during installation.  A lot.  I think I spent as much time lining those up for installation as I did the rest of the job.  It's kind of a tight squeeze to get this part in due to the fan shroud and any slight movement would allow those to shift and not line up when I was trying to thread the bolt.  It would have been better to spot weld a nut on the frame like the original.<br /><br />Aside from that, it was a smooth install with perfect compatibility with my 2001 Sequoia.  I have driven it for two days and it is performing great.  I used a video on YouTube for a 00-05 Tundra and it was the same procedure.
B003BYFTEE|4|Looks as stated but much clumsier and feels cheap. The locking mechanism is also cheap and could be broken into very easily. Fits nicely in my Crown Victoria Police Interceptor though
B003UYWUBK|2|No it did not the first time I used it one of the adjuster strip out that goes on the lifting arms. Got that fixed and was working with it some more at a later date got hung up on a rock I lift the chisel plow up and went to back up and it broke the adjuster and bent the shaft on the linear actuators now I can't use any of the three point hitch or the tools. I now have to call kolpin dirtworks to see if they're going to make this all good or if I'm going half to buy all this my self so I can get this fixed. I would like to get my food plots done because deer season is almost here. If they don't take care of this I'll never buy anything else from them and will let every one  know just how there product really is. Johnnie Ellis TN.
B00E9G0KKQ|5|Fits  great.. Looks just like the O. M. E. that I took out.<br />  thanks
B00496GUC8|4|Very good
B010154KUY|5|I had a lot of concerns buying a product that was not OEM. These Fit perfectly, they look good, and they are built tough (Ceramic Material over plastic in key areas). I did not use the light bulbs that came with this because I bought these to use with HID bulbs. The bulbs that did come with this set are a bit dim, but you are using xenon bulbs in a projector housing so it makes sense. With HID bulbs they project the light very well onto the road ( like fog lights are supposed to). They have a nice cut-off zone. The only thing I need to do now is adjust the cut off to my personal preference, and I doubt i'll have any problems with these. I have/ and will highly recommend these, it was really nice to take them out of the box, and just put them in with no trouble.
B00USCUZ0A|5|As advertised. PERFECT!
B000GZOL0O|5|Nice final touch and protects as will as adding some rigidity to the tip
B0013LJ28G|5|Quality product, a very good improvement in braking performance over the stock FA228 non-sintered brake pads.
B002QSNABK|5|Exactly as ordered. Delivered as promised.
B005TTZF52|1|Very difficult to install be careful.  They make it sound easy..its not at all
B0053TVKN4|5|Good
B00FMV0WFA|4|Pissed off at GM since I bought a $64,000 truck and this was not included.<br /><br />BUT it is a welcome addition!!
B001RLTZ7A|5|Works great I'm my 2012 f150 ecoboost.
B004BSCVAO|5|Perfect no issues!
B001PTBVL2|5|nice new item and fast shipping
B009AQT0V0|5|Works great for me.  I got an aluminum cargo carrier for behind my Jeep Wrangler, but I couldn't open the rear hatch because the spare tire would catch on the carrier.  I put this on to lower the carrier a couple inches and now I have no problem.  I can put my hunting gear in the back and if I'm lucky enough to bag a deer, my carrier is right there to load it onto.
B00B36EH2M|5|I read up on this and decided to buy based on reviews. Wish it came in a quart or gallon since I was spraying such a large piece but it worked out. The paint is very rough when dry and makes for excellent adhesion for the topcoat. I believe it will hold up and help keep the rust away for years.
B000WO8E6Q|5|very good
B005R0R04W|4|I am a HUGE Hello Kitty Fan! So of course, after I bought my new car, I had to have an air freshener, a cute one. so I bought this. It's a 2-pack, very inexpensive, shipping was before it was predicted. The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because the smell lasted MAYBE 3 days..which isn't very long at all. I'm still going to leave it on the rearview mirror even though the smell is gone.
B00HX1ZY7I|5|These really are the actual Lexus leather key gloves just like the ones the dealer gave us when we bought our car.  Excellent leather construction and a perfect fit to the fob.
B003OAES8I|5|These really help complete the look of the front of our Rubicon. The headlights really stand out. Super easy to adhere and have been in place for almost a year now with no problems.
B006VN3GHY|5|Easy to install. Plugs in fast.
B00N12RQW4|5|Great fit, very cute (:
B00TQ32CQ2|5|Great love it perfect for my red mustang
B00RBW43MG|1|The paint, supposedly QAB pearl white is clearly not the same as the original Nissan QAB pearl white.
B00FMOJZHS|5|Worked perfectly, installed in 3 mins and rubber protector was a nice touch to protect the paint.
B000DN7Q3S|5|easy to put on
B005DHY024|5|Excelente
B00DJVO8DC|2|They are nice, but did not fit the bolts on my license plate.
B00HYYLKSQ|5|:)
B00B788KRO|5|Best air freshener EVER, and it only takes a little bit...don't over spray!
B000IG3QNY|2|made very flimsy lights don't stay on for a Bell product very disappointed
B00HPE6PQM|1|It came pretty quickly which I really liked and I had no trouble setting it up with my car speakers. I bought it for the Subwoofer output. The SW output does not work. I can't get any sound out of my subs. Kinda makes me mad.
B006JD4IJ6|5|the seat covers were great I ordered front and back and than come back and orderd for another truck they are great and I recommend to use these to save the original fabric. Good quality for the money
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great! That thing protects my baby child from harmul UV rays. Thank you so much. It also fits my car and  it's very easy to remove and install shades.
B00N9LGKMY|5|Great product I just love it
B00V8ZUWMM|5|Awesome
B0026M9DZS|5|So far so good. I installed it and it hasn't been an issue since. It is definitely a better part than the original, where it's a solid part and the original was a hollow part.
B000CMH4XC|5|great quality, easy fit.
B00XZ9MZ74|5|It's great that people are making these parts available.  Mom had busted the plastic part where the ring went through and fixed it with putty because she didn't want to spend  $100+ at Nissan for a new remote.  I ordered this, it got here fast, and the board from the old one went in just fine.  Works better than before even!
B000BYGFGI|3|These fit well but had some difficulty making sure that they were snapped into the rotor cap and or the spark plugs
B00OQ1ARNY|1|I built a hard tail DI2 race bike using this stem.  It fails to preload the headset properly (Chris King inset 3) so the headset always comes loose.<br />This crappy stem does not work, do not fall for the hype.  Very very disappointing.
B00SDMJLQ6|1|Said fits most cars. Does not fit 1998 ford mustang. Otherwise, it looks to be well made. Guess it is, not certain as cannot use it to find out.
B004940ZSK|5|Everything was as expected. No problems with shipping, quality of product or seller.
B00N4GZ8NQ|5|Great mirrors, fit perfectly, easy install even if you're dumb!
B009K4FVSS|5|The Oem look gives it that aggressive window look. Fast shipping and must agree that it was worth the money!!
B004NVA3WM|5|worth every penny
B00LAEXEYE|5|Product worked as expected. Quick to ship. Thanks
B00NQHZ176|4|good lights, could be a tad bit brighter. Craftsmanship looked good, and works well. I put mine in a pond, and it's encased in a Plexiglas box, so far so good......
B005FKR5JE|5|Great price for a great product. It came with all parts needed for install including silicone grease for the caliper pin. Highly recommend them!
B000FIY08U|5|Works
B001KS8LRU|5|Just as advertised
B004C65DYQ|5|OEM. Much cheaper than buying from the dealer.
B00173U7D4|5|Takes a few treatments but I always use it on used cars I buy and after a few days of consistent treatment, my cars smell good/neutral again.
B00PY2F9K0|4|Good quality and works well. The problem I had was, if you put it in the drawer to transfer the dimensions, it come up short. The reason: it stretched too easily when measuring this way. Measure the drawer first, then lay it out to be sure it it fully retracted/compacted.
B00DBEQIIU|5|As expected
B002QSD39O|3|Results OK not Dramatic liked I had hoped
B004JV6OMO|4|Have a number of vehicles and with these, I'm able to use the battery chargers I already have to handle the extra needs of ATV, motorcycle, and tractor. Well made and well priced.
B00B8E24NI|3|original cap did not worked with it and had to buy a new cap
B000IZ5CCI|5|This is the right part for a 1995 S10 4.3L V6, W engine.  I tried a cheap aftermarket before this that failed in short order. This one is fine.
B001F0MOUS|3|not for larger boats. if you are under 25' you may be ok.
B004RNOV9M|5|No leaks, solid built, easy to unload, and flushes fine. Not much else to say.
B0096TRDZG|5|I absolutely love having my Braves parking tickets kept in place and visible for Security to see.  It also keeps the ticket from blowing out my window or falling on the floor of my car.  Love it, love it, love it!
B0036E9VB6|5|works real well
B000C9JAGE|5|Great replacement worked well no issues.
B00PKFANFC|2|Second pair from this brand/manufacturer and the fabric if you can call it that wears through in about a month two at most like cheap nylon stockings. I am going to have to put duct tape over the area it is wearing through this time (driver side where body brushes it getting in and out of car) if I have any change of this working to protect my original car seats.
B008EEYWKI|5|very  good price fit my truck and its the original parts for my truck for less
B000VJPVJK|5|Decent stuff. using it my drag bike, so far so good.
B0091OE6K6|3|I can not seem to get them properly. Hope I can figure it out.
B001RLZ7P4|5|I bought NKG (2397) BKUR6ET spark plugs for my 2000 Jetta 2.0. The plugs previously installed by previous owner were ACDelco which made my car misfire. I installed them with NKG (57041) VWC035 wires. My car now runs smooth. The wire set is high quality. I also paid less than what I would have paid for other brands being offered at the auto part stores I researched. These are the right wires for this car. Note: You will need a spark plug wire removal  tool to make the job easier and do it correctly. You will understand when you are removing and installing your new wire set. I almost cheaped out and didn't get the tool.
B0074WPKAC|4|This fan works fine, (a bit loud) the only reason I had to return it is  it didn't  fit into my cup holder. (I have an older car)<br />That shouldn't be a problem  for newer makes and models.
B000LE6AXG|5|love it, on long tirps
B000C5I6FE|1|Fits fine.  Doesn't work.  99 xj...
B007WR66QQ|5|Good fit on an audi b7 a4 with 2.0t. Cars performance and mileage have also been improved.
B003PERH9K|5|I put it on my new Hydro flask. Looks so cute. Arrived in timely manner
B000GTY9FM|5|Works perfect as usual.
B007Y87L12|1|had to repair replacement alt buyer insisted good. tested bad independent shop.
B00V8ZYPAM|5|Great
B003PJRI4Y|1|Did not fit the car correctly and needed more hardware to make it work. It sits level but the hitch is slightly sideways. This made my luggage rack lean to the right. It still runs the exhaust so it makes awful noise and I will have to cut and adj the exhaust. Bought this specifically to fit my g6
B007NGAV9Y|5|Nice.
B00O70J8KC|3|Standard
B000C9SR90|5|Let me start by saying that I am not a mechanic of any kind. In fact, I'm pretty much as far away from experienced with car stuff as you can get. The only way I know how to do this kind of work is through YouTube videos (yeah...not always a good idea!).<br /><br />With that being said, I managed to change the fuel filter myself! It really wasn't all that bad, and didn't take nearly as long as I had expected. What made it easy? This part was an exact fit for my vehicle. It was clearly labeled with the in/out fittings and made changing out the filter very easy. The part was a true ACDelco part and has functioned wonderfully in my 2000 Suburban.<br /><br />I would highly recommend the ACDelco brand for your next car part. Not only are the made extremely well, but they fit exactly as expected.
B000VU91SG|5|Jute as I had hoped for.  My 2012 Ford F-150 has a factory liner that allows everything that you put in it.  I read the reviews regarding having a factory liner but I decided  to give it a try.  Others had said it may need to be trimmed but I didn't have to do and trimming.  I put it in, the sides towards the back curled up slightly but had no affect on the fit.  I would highly recommend this bed mat.
B002D7C32Q|5|works well
B00LMICPRU|3|This is a good product with crappy instructions, I use this for a 12v tennis ball machine that I wanted to cut on and off wireless, the instructions that came with the item, just restated what the tags on the wires said. Terrible, just terrible. Went on you tube to figure the rest out. Some guy got it to work with a 9v battery to power the remote, I didn't, it seem to lock up and stay on. When I switched to the power to 12 volts to power the device it worked. A simple diagram would have saved me so much looking and trips to the store trying alternatives. In the future please correct this so you can do true justice to this cool product. Thanks
B0002KR88A|5|great
B0008FUH46|5|perfect and Amazon priced it right
B00FNWETPW|5|Very fast shipping price was great
B007OSL3DY|2|I bought 2 - mine worked fine, but the one I got for my dad didn't stick to the tailgate well and ended up binding and denting the joint between the tailgate and the body.  It's a great idea and gives good piece of mind, but the risk to damage is pretty high if not done exactly right or the small stickers fail.  The risk of damage to the vehicle needs to be significantly reduced.
B0049XQJZE|5|switch works great. thanks
B00MQPGEM0|5|Product matched the description and worked.
B0050GXHAY|1|Not A strong  fiberglass pole had two of them and they keeps splitting
B001P3VJR4|5|No more rain in our laps and shade when we need it.  Yahoo !!!!
B010XZRQCG|4|Color looks very nice and the intensity matches the rest of my LEDs. It is kind of finicky on the install. Make sure you use dielectric grease. 08 JK Unlimited Rubicon
B00GG9FB8U|5|Love it!
B00D3R37T8|4|Priced good and quick delivery. Will purchase from SVS Powersports again.
B00JRE38EA|4|Fantastic light. Very bright, will continue to replace all my incandescent bulbs with these
B00I48HZ3K|5|Really looks great on my rzr. This thing is really solid and I can't wait to get on the trails with it.
B000BUQODG|5|WORKS GREAT
B00153EYTO|5|It was the wrong amp ts but go power and Amazon upgraded me to the ts 50
B000C5FKC6|5|Does the job!
B00BGRDMOM|5|Used on my 2007 4Runner Limited 4WD with Icon Stage I kit and Goodyear Duratracs. Simple and straightforward. Relieved tire rubbing in front.
B00EKTIV30|4|Satisfied with product.  It worked very well on my husbands car.
B00UJA1GI6|5|Awesome little lights. We attached these to our 2010 tundra. They are nice bright lights. The build is high quality metal casing. They have handled the trails already and have zero digs or dents from the rock spray. The wife loves them because they are not huge and gaudy but put off a nice amount of light. I would recommend these for anyone after a nice set of small fog light or spot driving lights for trail running or outbacking. Happy trail running.
B000GU5IH4|5|Ive had these on my bike for about 6 months and thousands of miles. The sound quality has impressed me over and over. Reviews about the paint fading are correct, but 5 minutes with some Spray paint fixed that! Great buy!
B000L9AD2K|5|Exceeded my expectations.  This little work hourse pumped up my PU truck tires in about six minutes.
B000IYPNC8|5|Good
B006E4SFHQ|5|Good product, excellent prize, fits console well.
B009FREAGO|5|Just what I wanted for our cross country trip. The inside is coated so anything is easy to clean out
B00BZQQTPS|5|Fits like a glove on my 2014 Ram 1500.
B006VXDSZ4|1|Cheap and not as the description!
B00407YPAU|5|Used to paint outside cover on car mirror. Works great!!!
B0042Z0E6E|4|Looks very close to the picture. It works well on the patio...covers the concrete crack!  It's very light weight, so does flip over in wind.
B00I9M040W|5|Arrived on time, installed easily, working great.
B0026TA3N2|5|Thanks
B00BICONB6|5|look good on my mini clubman
B00CNXMUL4|5|Good family and friends gift
B000CQOIVO|1|I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, the product broke within ten seconds of putting it on.
B000E7SY16|5|I was looking for light duty bungees for my bike, something with a lighter pull, with more compact hook ends. And hook ends made of plastic so they won't scratch up my bike's finish. In other words, I don't need those hard-to-pull industrial strength rubber bungees with metal ends. Jeez, I'm not trying to haul around heavy machinery.<br /><br />This assortment of bungee cords and ties are perfect for biking. I use the red ones the most. They wrap around my rear bike rack perfectly; I just hook one end to the bottom of one support, then up and around the top of the rack securing my cargo, and back down hooking the other end to the bottom of the other support.<br /><br />I've gone on some long trips hauling camping gear, food, and a backpack full of clothes. And these bungee cords worked just fine for securing that stuff to my bike. Heck, even those small black ones worked well for securing lighter items like a camping lunch box to my bike. They too can be used in emergency situations when you need a smaller bungee in conjunction with a bigger one. I've even found a use for the clear plastic container that they come in. I use it to hold some gear, then I secure it to my bike just beneath the top frame.<br /><br />It's a versatile, colorful set of bungees, to be sure. Perfect for biking. Highly recommended!
B000BWDZAO|5|Works good
B0085OJXB0|5|Girlfriend loved it.
B0012LGLVS|5|I'm very happy that I went with aluminum ramps as they are very light and work great. I don't use them for a ton of weight. I only use them to transfer a pressure washer and paint sprayer in to the bed of my truck. I am also happy I got the 90&#34; so that the incline is not too steep. If you are using them for something heavy you may want to take a look and the center as it is just a relatively thin sheet of aluminum welded to the frame. Other than that I am extremely pleased with them because they allow me to easily transport them on paint jobs without needing extra help just to get the equipment out of the truck.
B001IE8FQI|5|For years, we had the noisiest neighbors - they were always fighting with each other outside. So I got a bunch of these and hung them on the inside of my windows facing their building and they stopped fighting outside - they took their fights into their house. And then they all moved!! This could very well be a 'coincidence' you say, but another family have moved in: a couple, two grandparents and 4 kids - and I never hear them!<br />I will always hang these in my windows for peace and quiet.<br /><br />The only thing is, the condensation from the windows will eventually make them expand and split. But for $5 a piece, I can deal with that!
B000CQ20JQ|1|DID not fit!
B003WOXOD6|1|waste of money , if you lock something any one can pull the cable and extend it  to get the locked things you locked .
B003VAYRNM|4|acceptable product for the price.
B000N8IJSO|5|The power you can feel? I don't know... didn't notices it sounded any better running with new plugs but took for a drive and you can feel the difference from being new or what who knows. They are big fat heavy duty cables overkill on a Miata but very nice
B00P9OF04I|5|I had been prepared to spend an hour or two with other products.  Not so with this - simple and easy.  I still find it hard to believe, but am happy to recommend it.
B00B2ATTUE|5|Bought these to keep our travel trailer from rocking when walking around in the trailer.  It works great.  Glad I found these.
B0093PI43S|5|Work as advertised.  Does reduce vibrations.  I had raised the forks in the triple tree to lower the bike.  To use these I had to reduce the amount of fork above the upper tree so the bolts wouldn't touch the forks.  Pretty quick shipping.
B00ROBIXZM|5|Great product. Easy to install. And they look amazing on the car.
B006QMN7HO|5|Wonderful product and easy to install.  Love it!
B001DKNSE6|1|Used it Saturday afternoon 8/29/15 on the hood after using the DUPLI-COLOR paint. The paint was very nice and dry. I followed directions and waited 2 hours and used this Acrylic Lacquer. Well its now Sunday afternoon and the lacquer is still sticky. Now what should I do, wait 4 weeks and hope it dries. It already has a few bugs stuck to it. When I used it I was in the shade outside, it was about 85 degrees and the humidity about 70% in southern PA.<br />Any idea  how to take off this lacquer but protect the new paint? Have to give 1 star because of the rework I now have to do.
B00NLQW2RE|3|Color matched perfectly. Spray nozzle kept clogging and spray was a bit inconsistent.
B00UEABQ0Y|4|My head is a little big for the largest size. Tight fit. Two nice visors.
B0014BAGPI|5|Great Price
B006RMQCFW|5|used to remove armourall and other polishes before applying various stick ons, works great if follow directions
B007PKC6KK|5|Exactly what I wanted. I bought one then liked it so much bought another one for nightstand and one for bathroom. Love that it has a light. It is not too bright so does not wake Hubby when I check it at night.Nice.
B0048FO9Z0|4|Looks great on my pilot.
B001P4IQI8|5|Shipped fast, perfect fit and function. A++
B005NLQAHS|5|This was incredibly easy to use! I popped it in, paired it as instructed, and immediately was able to find out why we had error codes on my husband's Pontiac Sunfire!
B00HU6N3LK|3|Never use it! But I hear it's the best on the market for leather.
B000C5FLFC|5|Same as the original part.  What more can you say?
B00062YY54|1|I originally rated this as a 4, but it is now a definite 1.  It worked fine for a week, but then every time everything was up to temp and hot the motor would start to skip and just die on occasion at idle.  I pulled this off and reinstalled my original coil, problem solved.  I should have read the previous negative reviews as they describe the exact same issue that I experienced.  This was installed in addition to the ACCEL 2010 Point Eliminator Kit.  I figured since I was doing it might as well replace the 50 year old OE coil.  Back to the original coil with the electronic ignition and the car is running outstanding.
B00P5DCNB6|5|This is a nice, simple unit. It readily provides the angle of inclination. The indicator is properly damped by the fluid in the gage tube, so that the reading is steady and changes smoothly, yet rapidly enough to be accurate. Installation is easy, as it is attached with adhesive tape, and there are no wires to hookup or route. The only downside is that there is no internal light, so readability is limited by availability of external lighting, whether daylight or other source.
B0018YCROY|2|Purchased these 39 months ago, through a friends Amazon account, for my 2002 Dodge Grand Caravan. I had experienced inconsistent pulsing in the brake pedal which became more pronounced over time and I narrowed down to be the front right brake assembly. After removing them, they were rusted on to the hub, to have machined, (Warranty 36 months) I was informed they were delaminating and could not be turned?! Not sure how they are corrosion resistant when the edges were rusted and flaking and face was delaminated!!!
B0027XYKZO|5|You can always count on Felpro to deliver good fit and reliability.
B009R4PE4M|5|works good .
B004A9AHF0|5|this will not save your noggin, remember its basically a plastic hat. but I wore it and enjoyed it.
B004JL0QZA|4|Does a good job in keeping items in place!
B00INVEUS6|5|Great price
B00061SMEE|5|This puller works on GM trucks, Period. You do not have to remove the steering box or even loosen it. It works well. Worst thing you may have to do is rotate the pitman arm to the left or right to get a clean grip on the arm (some frames are just a bit tight on shoulder clearance, mine was) and have a spot to knock the arm itself with your hammer. I had a harder time getting the old ball joint out of the drag link than pulling the arm off the steering shaft. Don't waste your money on the snap-on tools puller (at 200 to 400 dollars, its a waste of both time and money). I have used both types, and I will pay for several of these before I ever pick up that snap-on thing again. BTW, it only took me 10 minutes from start to arm being off the steering box. Your results will of course vary depending on the vehicle. Don't forget to hit the threads and splines with some good penetrating oils like PB Blaster a day or two before you start, of course, if you can.
B007HPTI5E|4|Nice.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Nice and big, happy with the item
B000GZJPI2|5|Worked just like new.
B00L9IC2TO|5|Great packaging, looks great, light weight and high quality. Installed myself in about 15 minutes. Took off 2 bolts and slipped new exhaust on and put back on the 2 bolts.
B001S7ZT5A|5|Just want I want
B000HBNV58|5|Worked well to quiet the stabilized keycaps on my keyboard. I put some on a q-tip and then smeared it around on the plastic stabilizer part with the metal hinge stabilizer. No more squeaky keys.
B000BHKZIE|5|Accurate gauges, no leaks, easy to use. Iv used it about 10 times so far with no issues.
B000HS1356|4|I've been using this cover for 5 months now (undercover, multistory car park) as a replacement of a stolen cover. He cover works fine, protects the bike well. I really like the concept of the alarm. Two things hat I don't like about this cover are: if you are a thief, probably you will know hat DOWCO covers come with alarm... Having the big DOWCO logo on the cover is not a deterrent, but a message to say &#34;remove with caution, cover may have an alarm&#34; . The second feature that I don't like is the ventilation on the front... The concept is good by I've noticed that dust gets inside significantly more than my previous cover, which, makes it impossible for me to ride my bike without dusting it or cleaning it.<br /><br />Cleaning the cover is easy and it dries quickly, and it fits perfectly.
B001C6OYVM|5|no problems
B000TTQ2DG|5|perfectly fit my 2007 Subaru Forester 2.5X
B00BQS76NE|5|Great
B000M5X0MS|5|to fill batteries
B009B9PCB8|4|It gives a significant effect. But the inner plastic plate is somewhat fragile - from time to time it breaks here and there and there will be permanent cracks.
B007NJXXOG|5|Installed on my 2007 FJ along with a new air intake. Converted the exhaust to a true dual exhaust. Sounds throaty. Performance has not been confirmed on dyno.
B001DH0Q62|5|perfect fit
B00UM9X1EQ|4|Decent gauges at a decent price
B004BT7T8W|5|Good price good deal. half the price compared to local auto parts stores, no complaints yet, installed about month ago
B006N9HM2Q|5|Worked good, no adjustment needed
B008CE06ZA|4|Exactly what I needed. This hitch has ample choices for the different heights of our trucks at home. Good value.
B003TPDC80|5|Works awesome with the Perfect polish!!
B00E63TI32|5|What a great surprise. Its large, but it keeps water cool in 107 degree weather, hotter inside my house.
B006O5J6M8|5|I needed something reliable and dependable for my ATVs and this was the perfect solution to insure no more theft of tampering.
B004SX5HMG|4|The lights are great for the price. bright at night and decent during the day. I actually hooked them up to a SHO ME flasher and could select my own patern. I did cut away the box the lights came with because it was cheap crap. After I hooked them up to my own flasher box and I did connect them to my existing switch box in my off duty car they worked fine. Would have gave 5 stars but the selector box that came with the lights was cheap crap.
B0024E6ZW2|5|Great product. Saves wear & tear on the steps. Keeps them solid & safer to step on. Helps the shaking/moving of RV when using steps. I also put a 8 x 10 board on top of it so there is more support.
B00110UTGS|3|Not too sure about it when I received it.  Looked rather odd.  But once I put on the steering wheel, it works great and does not slide around.  Keeps steering wheel nice and cool on hot days. *** Would definitely recommend and would buy again.**  That is what I wrote when I first received the steering wheel cover.  But after using it for a few months, the plastic stitching does stick out and annoy me and now it has started to tear apart at different spots.  Need another one, but not sure I'm going to order this one.
B004I1253W|5|Part arrived very quickly and looks great.
B0093ISJ30|5|Excellent  as expected
B00IOBSXQ0|3|It is ok, but not great as advertised. It looks ok at the beginning but later on get back to normal. i give it 2 and half stars
B001HQHGVM|4|The pins are not very heavy duty...
B00BMU9DS2|5|As advertised.
B0059ACOXW|4|Powerful little motor, but it needed some refinements. The center reel center cover has sharp screws that protrude into cord end compartment and the center opening for the cord needed edge guard around it.
B001G6PNRC|5|Easy to install and worked great
B003SNQYGA|1|The plastic casing around the motor cracked within one day of use.  This rendered the whole kit useless and again my window will not go up or down.
B002GOFVS4|3|This is important before you buy.  This states it will fit a 2 inch receiver.  Yes it will slide in but the lock WILL NOT REACH.  I tried contacting the sellers with no success.  I didn't want to return it cuz it is a good looking peice.  I ended up going to autozone and buying a three inch lock.
B001JT0CGI|5|Good produck.
B00BQ10G0G|5|Great wall storage!  Exactly as pictured.  I use it to hold my toiletries and there are enough little compartments to keep everything organized.  I plan to buy a few more!
B00Q1F7VEG|5|Works well. Easy to install. East shipping. Thanks
B005XYV066|5|Fits good on my 2009 Honda CR-V
B005B494YS|2|glasses looked awesome except the came damaged, lens popped out
B0088JR9X6|5|Product is good. Package was opened and crushed.
B0031C3UG0|5|Had a quarter size chip on my front bumper. Using 400 grit wet sand paper I lightly sanded to smooth out the edges. I applied multiple light costs lightly sanding each time. The chip is virtually invisible unless you know where to look. Very satisfied
B001QUFBVG|5|Great product!!
B00P3XSET8|5|I bought this for my 2015 Yamaha FZ-09, arrived quick, perfect fit and best of all washable/reusable. I have a K&N air filter in everything I drive, no problems yet.
B000CP8ATQ|5|Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You.
B002YCE2VA|5|fit perfect
B00065L2D8|5|Get them. eventually you WILL need them. Even if your &#34;emergency&#34; is a dead cell phone and a broken cigarette lighter
B00BERR4FW|5|perfect fit
B000YE15GK|5|No surprises!
B001DNAHRY|5|Easy install.  Very nice product.  I would highly recommend it.
B00EDDKXYI|4|It works great. However, It will make your power steering pump whine when your turning your steering wheel, but for the price I'm certainly not going to complain. You won't even notice the noise after a while.
B00173U7D4|4|This is seriously the only air freshener I can stand. It smalls nice without being too strong.
B008F5RTYC|5|I bought this for my 2013 JX35 after hearing how much the dealer would charge (hint: lots). It arrived in 2 days as promised and was exactly as described. Incredibly the instructions had pictures of exactly my car model, which made things a lot easier to understand than if they had been generic. Already I was impressed. Installation was a bit bumpy due to my inexperience, but the whole thing start to finish only took 2 hours or so and it came out nicely - the hitch is invisible except for the actual receiver.<br /><br />A few things to be aware of:<br />1. Getting the factory tow hook off the JX35 is a total pain unless you have an impact wrench - I managed to get two bolts off with a breaker bar but the other two were not budging. Thankfully my local garage popped them off for me free of charge.<br />2. As others have noted doing this by yourself is tough - especially getting the unit close enough to get the bolts in. I built up a platform using 4x4s and it worked fine but do be careful as it's pretty heavy.<br />3. I made the mistake of putting one bolt in on the driver's side before trying to move the passenger side into position - this is a problem because the muffler is actually in the way, you need to sort of slide the lip where the bolts go up and under the muffler before attaching any bolts. So, lost a few minutes there but had a great opportunity to practice my curse-words.<br />4. The bolts have to be torqued correctly, so if you do it yourself you need a torque wrench. I bought an excellent one on Amazon for not too much (Capri) and using an extension was able to get all 6 bolts torqued up all the way to the required number.<br />5. You have cut a little rectangle out of the rear bumper fascia, but it's totally invisible. They recommend using a roto-tool, but since I don't have one I was able to easily make the cut with my utility knife.<br /><br />I am really happy about this purchase, I got a high quality hitch at a fraction of having the dealer installit. If you're even moderately handy and have the right tools available this is the hitch for you. Highly recommended.
B008N225UA|4|Great addition to my truck. A simple way to show pride for my service as a 13B in the US Army. 1-17 FA.
B000E35UV2|2|cheap but for the price will get the job done  i don't like how it pulls and drains and dumps coolant
B000HBNTGY|5|Way better than tape...I'll never use tape in my shop again.
B005AJF1NM|5|Great fit and easy installation. Did a BAMA tune after installation and I can feel the difference. Fast shipment.
B003IHMHLW|5|Great product makes life easy
B00167TYHQ|5|Thislittlebox isn't great for when you need a jump or need air in your Tires! A real plus is using it to inflate kids toys & rafts !
B002R0KJ2U|2|Not original from usa
B00PHRU5C4|2|Bright Light, fit right in - BUT - failed after only 2 months.
B00PQ7Z0BQ|1|Made with cheap plastic. Only measured 60-65 decibels in my sound meter instead of 75+ stated in the manual. Battery's panel can easily pop open inside your pocket.
B0030WM7BU|3|One of the coils died on me about a month after installing
B00AOAFP9C|4|unit changed my 4 quart diesel crankcase oil out in less than 5 minutes. Nice compact changer, easy to use. I will probably replace tubing with something having less 'memory'. When you remove tubing from engine it tries to go back into a coil and whips the oil on it around. A little messy.
B00IMVG7V0|5|Stickers are exactly as described and came with easy to understand instructions. Best of all they sent a free sticker of the one ordered but of a different color. Red N Green Tree is now my first choice for all my sticker needs.
B00G3HXTQQ|3|replacement part
B001Q8DMA0|4|Dries really well. Don't even need to wring it out. Only -1 star because it does catch on ever little part of the car that sticks out. ( emblems, wipers, etc)
B00099XKKY|5|I like to take good care of my vehicle, but I don't want to spend half my Saturday detailing!  This is probably the easiest method I've found to clean and polish my tires.  The foam leaves them a deep black satin (not too glossy), which makes the whole car look more polished and well-maintained.  I've gotten the best results by applying it several minutes before I start washing the rest of the vehicle & then vacuuming or getting the rest of my supplies together.  This allows the foam time to work before being rinsed away, and prevents overspray onto freshly washed fenders or rims.  It can leave a residue on concrete so if you have a driveway you want to keep clean, you might want to move your car to the street before using this product.
B00JJBX9UY|5|My husband loves it
B0068ES0L8|2|Seat is not as comfortable as I had hoped. Takes a bit of effort and patience to pump up to feel not much difference at all.<br />Seat dies not fit up close to tank like the stock seat. Leaving a gap and now you can see the run marks from the stick seat on the tank.<br />Flat out. Not what I expected ;(
B002Q1IOC2|5|works well
B00JIBFMY6|5|This product actually works great. Easy to use and effective. We was scrapping a car so tried it out on that and was impressed.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|Very Useful
B002BHWWVA|3|The spongy material doesn't allow for thicker sunglasses frames to fit inside, rendering it useless if your pair are very thick. My Oakley Flack Jacket sunglasses just barely fit, but eventually they proved to be too thick as well and the plastic hinge broke.  The only good thing was the wire spring that held them onto the visor.  That was perfect, great spring strength but still easy to move the clip when needed.
