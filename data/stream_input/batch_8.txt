B0012GN2I8|5|It is from this album that I actually coined a whole definition for a certain kind of music from the 70's,inspired by the title of a particularly funky song on this...particularly funky album. Herbie was on this huge musical winning streak in the mid 70's and,even so this album really stands out very strong even for this period in his career! One of main reasons is the addition of Ray Parker Jr who,much as the Brothers Johnson had on the previous album [[ASIN:B00000255O Man-Child]] had really gone above and beyond in his ability to enhance and add great flavors to the already well established Headhunters sound. Not only is this one of Herbie's most funky albums albums of this period but also his most thouroughly ear catching and....pretty melodic since [[ASIN:B000002AGP Head Hunters]] and it's also the most similar one they made to it. All their music from this period was that way but the previous two albums had gone after some more expirmental type sounds. This one not only gets back to the basics but adapts on the sound in all kinds of different ways. In every measurable sense this is a funk album through and through but not every song is alike.<br /><br />  \\"Doin' It\\" is.....well I'd say it was the best tune here but every one is so excellent that's hard to say but it's certainly one of the very strongest jams of 1976,a year full of 'em. The song starts from this Ray Parker riff that....builds into another riff until Herbie's keyboards and synthesizers kick and and build on top of them unti Ray starts singing \\"just keep on doing it!\\". This is a pointed reminder of the building nature of funk in it's heyday. His remake of his own \\"Cantaloupe Island\\" adds a this afro-caribbean stomp,along with kind of this marching \\"big four\\" jazz beat to the funk and gives the tune some extra added bounce. \\"Spider\\" is just an amazing song;like the theme song to a kind of \\"techno-blacksploitation\\" movie never made with it's bassy synth fanfare and that heavy chase scene rhythm. \\"Gentle Thoughts\\" is probably the most commercial sounding groove here as it sticks closest to the melody and sound fairly light for this type of album.<br /><br />  As for it's overall atmospherics...well lets just say it's most fittin that Lee Ritenour actually used this song as the title cut for his next album [[ASIN:B000056693 Gentle Thoughts]]. \\"Swamp Rat\\" is...among one of the most harmonically advanced tunes Herbie ever made with yet more fanfaring bass synths and,as for the second half of the song Paul Jackson's bass and Bennie Maupin's passionate work on sax and reeds carry that area. As for Maupin he gets a big kudos on his own \\"Sansho Shima\\" at the end of the album,which has this very strong afro cuban jazz flavor with the inprovisation being baught to the forefront and the funk kind of riding along in the middle. This album is kind of ignored because it's sandwiched after some well known classics and comes right before his disco-funk period-itself HIGHLY underrated. There is a progression from one to the other yet in terms of Herbie's powers as a soloist,bandleader and composer in the 70's,nevermind his funkiness this album is one of many that can't be beat!that heavy chase scene rhythm. \\"Gentle Thoughts\\" is probably the most commercial sounding groove here as it sticks closest to the melody and sound fairly light for this type of album.

B00AF6MF9I|5|It's awesome cool addicting fun I want to play every day or I go mad<br />I LOVE AND WANT TO PLAY A SECOND ONE OF THIS GAME IF YOU HAVE ONE
B0035HKWLW|4|This movie is good! Buuuttt....audiophiles beware, it only comes in stereo despite being advertised as 5.1. I did not finish it and went back to Netflix where the sound is good.
B00BHMF578|4|In spite of some significant deviations from historical fact, none of which change the basic story, this film well-cast film is both suspenseful and exciting. It's refreshing to see Federal employees portrayed as competent professionals rather than the dupes or villains in some ridiculous conspiracy. Ben Affleck's understated performance as a CIA operative offers a rare look at the real world of overseas intelligence work, rather than the Mission Impossible fantasy world so loved by Hollywood. All in all, this is a fine film that creates a real sense of the period and a crisis that shaped America for the last decade of the Cold War.
B009RX8AQW|5|This is move than I hoped for, and developed the main characters much more. It is a very satisfying season.
B007BLCGNU|4|I'm very surprised by Decaprio's ability to transform himself and play such a legend. The make-up as he ages is also much better than I expected.
B00AREIAI8|3|Good game but everything's too expensive
B003GK21OE|4|There is nothing that Baldacci has written that I have not enjoyed.  He IS good.  King and Maxwell have a spark that keeps the reader wanting more.  I want the fire of a romantic involvement but Baldacci is smart.  He leaves us always on the edge.
B006M7JCC2|5|A read for everyone, wonderful, inspiring and uplifting
0446613444|5|Gotta love that Harry, this is an older book that I somehow missed and the really freaky thing about it was the day it was delivered was the day I got out of the hospital after flipping my truck on BLACK ICE. This was a really good book it had me right to the end , a couple of times I thought I had the answers but then it twisted and turned and I was wrong, so even though I knew some of the players ahead of time it was a good read.
B002ZG99CM|5|Some cheesy acting but an excellent movie.  It will bring tears to your eyes and you will cheer with glory in your eyes.  Watched it twice today.  Replaced an ugly rip with a high quality blu-ray and am extremely impressed.
B00BUCXVPI|2|I might have liked this movie more if I had never read the books. However, since I have read the books, I just couldn't reconcile Child's Reacher and this shrimpy, almost prissy, old Reacher.
0679428895|4|Having visited Pompei a couple of years ago and having had a rather truamatic experience there myself, ( My wife and daughter got seperated from me and it took me 4 hours to find them - Pompeii is big!)this book really fleshed out that experience. The last half of the book is particularly compelling to one who has visited because it has been accurately researched and the streets, locales in the book correspond to what you will experience there. Also many of the prominent characters correspond to names on election posters on the walls of the streets. After seeing the tortured looking stone figures of the victims of Vesuvius at Pompeiithe description of the eruption is particularly compelling. The insights into the administration of the aqueducts, the corruption etc. also is very interesting. The characters could have been more fully developed but in the end this does not deter from the engaging experience of reading the book. Bottom line: If you're going to visit Pompeii make it a point to read this book first and then bring it with you so you can visit the spots described not only in Pompeii but also in Herculaneum and Stabaie, Miseneum etc. and also the mountain itself.
B00VS8WIY4|5|This is the second of this author's books I have read recently and I enjoyed it just as much as the first.  Once again, Goss has provided us with a memorable, strong and accomplished female lead who is both smart, quick and resourceful. Gwynn Reznick is working undercover for an oil company when she witnessed a brutal murder.  Quickly realizing she is in over her head, Gwynn relies on her judgement and training to prevail. The writing is suspenseful, dramatic and action-filled. The characters are well described and memorable a Gwynn emerges as a very capable sleuth. I will get another!
B001BANK32|5|I haven't seen the movie in a while and decided to read this because of the next book. I'm super excited for Dr Sleep!
B002W1UEW4|4|I liked the action in this movie and would love to recommend this movie to a friend and looking for other parts of this movie to come
B00000JX0T|5|My whole family (ages 3-78) loves the Whole Notes series ...including this episode on Ravel.<br /><br />It's not pretending to be an academic thesis on the subject.<br /><br />These are light-hearted, engaging, 30-minute glimpses into the lives of our most beloved composers.<br /><br />Love classical music and want to feel a tiny connection to the composers? Here's a fun way that will likely inspire the musician and &#34;just listener&#34; alike to learn more.<br /><br />Thank you to the producers! Only wish: that there were more episodes!
B00JB3MVCW|3|Enjoyed it.
B0067AC5KA|5|I love love loved this series!  It was gripping, entertaining and surprising!  Well written and riveting!  A must read for mystery buffs!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Wow...I could not put this book down. Extremely well written and a fantastic plot. With all the mystery and suspense books out there obsessing on the serial killer, this was a refreshing change. After all this type of murder is much more common than serial killings. The plot and murder was so everyday and the characters could really be your neighbors.....and that's what make a good murder mystery very very scary. The fact that this could really happen to you or someone you know. Nothing is scarier or more realistic than \\" heat of the moment\\" anger and desperation.<br />Not a bloody butchering with disgusting descriptions of body parts strewn hither and yon to add gruesomeness to the plot.<br />Kudos to Paula Hawkins. The rest of the \\" blood and guts\\" genre are going to get a run for their money with this woman.
B004HXIZVC|1|Blah
B00000DFRS|1|Being a faithful, touched by all her previous work, fan I can't even get passed the second song! I have been listening to her music since I was 12, now I am 25, and I can't relate to any of these songs, maybe if I was still  a teenager and into hiphop, but this c.d is a let down.  It is not even  worth keeping it around.  I guess I will have to buy one of her old albums,  again.
B003VPWXRO|5|I throughly enjoyed this book.  I thought it was interesting and well written although it does jump around a bit.  I am not an extreme \\"dieter\\" but having been on a ton of different diets I could relate to the stories. The pictures were very sad but gave you a real sense of what horror she was living.  I highly recommend.
B0007Y4TVU|4|the first time i popped in the new system record i didn't know what to think. the album was great, but after a while the record stopped playing, shortly after i must add. then, i was like \\"what the f#@$?\\" i thought the cd was messed up or something, but the album had truly already ended. then, i heard system is coming out with second one soon (which is slated for release on november 22, by the way) and i rejoyced. the album is great at all angles, but i had to drop a star for the lack of length. three years is a long time to wait for a new album to be thirty minutes. i am planning to get the next album as well, but i think the albums should have been docked a couple of dollars. i am curious on what other people think on this subject. if you want to give me a shout, or give me an opinion i would be glad to hear it. my email addres is    bcaffeineman@aol.com
B006MW3UZW|5|My favorite show!
B004SBQALA|5|Excelente!
6305546797|5|The limited edition may be the way to go for Halloween. It's the cheapest way to get the extented tv version. Dare I say, it's the by far the best. Purist will complain, but the 12 additional minutes really set the tone for the film. If you love the original Halloween, GET THIS VERSION!
B000025H0Q|5|I wish Nick would have a longer career and a longer life.<br />Bryter Layter it`s indeed a fantastic album, you don`t have to skip a single song each one is so emotionally charged and intense, in comparison to pink moon and five leafs left this album features a fantastic band following Nick`s chords at its best It`s hard to tell which song is my favorite in this album cause I Love them all. I own Nicks complete discography but this album to me is something really special. If I would have to recommend an entry to new fans this album will be it.<br /><br />The beauty about Nicks music is that even while he was clearly depressed all songs leave to your own interpretation, it`s like a living soundtrack on your own life, you will find comfort on those velvet chords and acoustic strumming paterns while listening to his beautiful voice.<br /><br />My recommendations:<br />Really get them all!!<br /><br />Bryter Layter<br />Five Leaves Left<br />Pink Moon<br /><br />(this were the only three albums released by Nick, Five leaves left was the first but he was unnoticed at the timem gorgeous album!! he went somehow notticed and gaining a following cult with Bryter Layter and consumed his own with Pink moon. A 4th album appeared later with 4 tracks that were going to be part of his 4th studio album that never happened plus a few other takes on tap, this album is Time of no reply.<br /><br />Worth it!
B000059LGC|3|Death on the Nile, 1978 film<br /><br />The story begins in 1930s rural England where a Rolls-Royce drives to a country mansion. Miss Ridgeway inspects the grounds. They talk about a fortune hunter. Her friend Jackie asks Miss Ridgeway to give her boyfriend Simon Doyle a job; she agrees. Next, Linette will marry Simon and go on a honeymoon to Egypt. Uncle Andrew Pennington also plans to travel. The newlyweds climb a pyramid. Jackie is there too. Linette complains about her. We see other wealth tourists enjoy their vacation (and their background). Hercule Poirot is on vacation. Some dance the tango. [Isn’t it obsolete today, like the quadrille?] Poirot offers advice to Jackie about her life. “Do not allow evil into your heart.” The visitors board their cruise ship (a side wheeler). The talk tells about these people. [Would you want them as co-workers or neighbors?] Linette won’t sign legal documents unless she reads them. [Good advice.] Linette’s maid asks for promised money but is refused. Her lawyer is under suspicion.<br /><br />They ride donkeys and visit the sites. [Do some act suspiciously?] A falling stone nearly kills Linette! The others gather around. [For an alibi?] Poirot warns Jackie again. [What does he know?] Linette argues with a physician from Zurich over his treatment. Jackie acts unpleasant. When Simon tells her off Jackie draws her derringer and shoots him in his right leg! Later a scream at night tells of the murder of Linette! There is a “J” on the wall, written in blood. But Jackie has an alibi. Who are the suspects? Poirot and the Colonel begin the investigation. We see his hypothetical explanations. Who had a motive? [Too many?] The other passengers are questioned. Where are Mrs. Doyle’s pearls? Where is the gun? Who put a snake in Poirot’s room? A sword cane solves this problem. The natives fished out the murder weapon - a four shot .22 derringer. Where are Linette’s pearls?<br /><br />Pennington’s cabin is searched. Washe trying to keep control of Linette’s fortune? Is Jackie still in love with Simon? She talks to him. The Colonel and Poirot discuss the suspects: all of them. Blood reveal another body! Was the maid Louise Bourget a witness to be eliminated? Mrs. Otterbine has a solution: she is an eyewitness. But a shot silences her! Poirot gathers the tourists together in one room to solve the murders. Was there a third shot? Was Louise’s language a clue? Poirot reconstructs the murders. [Was it a surprise to you? Was it too complicated to succeed? Did it require split-second timing?] “Where’s the proof?” The moulage test uses paraffin to detect whose hand fired a pistol. There is an admission, then a tragic end. The tourists leave the boat.<br /><br />I haven’t read the novel so I don’t know how true it is to the book. It is a good dramatic story. It follows the old style where the murder victim is shown to be a nasty person (so the viewer doesn’t feel bad about the murder), and, all the suspects are gathered together in one room when the crime is solved. Wasn’t this story implausible? Did this story remind you of “Murder on the Orient Express”? Notice the slimness of some of the actors (historical accuracy?). Did women then wear such revealing dresses? How did Linette fall so quickly in love with Simon? Was it easy to buy poisonous snakes? Were people free to carry arms then? Raymond Chandler’s essay “The Simple Art of Murder” criticized those murder mysteries which were concocted to make a puzzle for the reader to solve.
B00005JLEU|5|Spirited Away is one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen, and deserves its place as one of the greatest films to ever be made. The story and characters are not spectacular (above par yes, but not spectacular), it's the way the director Hayao Miyazaki presents the story that makes Spirited Away so special. Miyazaki's colour pallet for the film gives it a certain edge over other animated movies, the film is truly art caught on film, the animation is spectacular and beyond Walt Disney's dreams. <br /> <br />The detail in the surroundings is astounding from the architecture of the bath house to the costume designs, that takes an interesting but quite simplistic story to something truly magical. There is so much feeling enveloped in every scene of this movie that it easily draws you into Chihiro's quest to escape the bath house and save her parents. <br /> <br />One thing that may deter people from this film is that it is very Japanese, and gives an insightful view into their culture. Certain cultural references may leave people misreading certain aspects of the film. Such as one magazine critic who thought that the bath house was similar to the red-light district. Even though bath houses are extremely common throughout Japan, have been so for hundreds of years and are very much an ordinary part of Japanese life. Even though some cultural references may cause some misunderstandings, the story of Chihiro is truly universal and can be understood by everyone, as this is a childrens film afterall. <br /> <br />There are a few scary bits in the film that may scare the kids, so Parental Guidance is advised. But this is a true gem, and gives the new slur of CG effects movies a good kicking, and shows what makes a good film. Disney may have forgotten how to make animated movies over the past thirty years (with a few exceptions) but Studio Ghibli is here to show that you can put all the money you want into making more realistic looking CG movies, but a great story and artful direction will win out overall.
B0063IH60K|4|One ad before each game, not bad for a free game. I haven't seen the problems others have. I've had this about a month. It isn't fancy - or complicated - just solitaire. There are a few settings, such as sound, appearance, scoring, one card or three. Just what I was looking for - solitaire, simple and free.
B00HV2KPNW|5|Great movie love olaf. Kids will love it.Why do i need to Write so Much when it is such a simple to just day it eas good

B00I2WNYJW|5|As a former student of International Economics at the University of Michigan way back in the mid 60's, I am finding the book quite interesting and provocative if a bit on the technical and intellectual side. I am thoroughly engrossed!
B00W3V83QW|3|For me it's a little boring. I play only when I have nothing else to play. I am sure others like it but I am not crazy about the hitting the balls games. Try it you may like it the graphics are great!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Really fun. Music was great.
B00NQKWA6S|4|A few minor nitpicks: 1)Track 2: &#34;It's What We Do&#34; drags in the last few minutes, despite its familiar loveliness. 2) Closing Track &#34;Louder Than Words&#34; isn't bad, but it has an 80's VH1 feel to it that seems a little awkward after what precedes it.<br />Those things being said, The Endless River is a worthy closing statement by one of the most legendary bands of the Rock era. The more expansive a fan you are, (i.e. the more of their catalog you are aware of and appreciate) the more you are likely to delight in the many overt and subtle reversions that occur throughout. In many ways, the album feels like a time warp to the transitioning, experimental, soundscape-weaving Pink Floyd of 1968-1972, sprinkled with the stylings of everything they've done since. That, from my point of view, is just about the perfect note for them to go out on. My above nitpicks aside, it has been a joy to behold.<br />Pink Floyd is, for some, a monolith, for others, a familiar brand name, for still others, an iconic link to a significant past. Their history is full of twists, turns, breakups, and endurance and, throughout, their legion of fans has fractured and splintered into various camps and loyalties. All of this, combined with their status as one of the biggest selling bands of all time, tends to make it difficult for one to simply listen to a Pink Floyd album as it is, i.e. to take in the experience of hearing it both on its own terms and on one's own terms as a listener. But, to those who find themselves able to do just that, The Endless River will take you places, some familiar, some new. It will take you to some majestic places and it will take you to some haunting places, And it will bring you back, unharmed, perhaps even delighted. Erstwhile Pink Floyd bassist and lyricist Roger Waters once went out of his way to try to convince the public that his former band mates were washed-up con-artists who were only trying to further cash in on the brand name. The Endless River shows just how wrong he was. It is the sound of three longtime collaborators re-discovering what they do best - when they do it together.<br /><br /> Farewell to Richard Wright and thank you David and Nick!
B0018LMZOE|5|The first Moody Blues album I ever bought, although I'd heard Days of  Future Past in college.  I find it the most interesting and intellectual album of their &#34;7.&#34;  My favorite track is probably &#34;You can never go home,&#34; but all the tracks are great.  As usual, the Moody Blues lyrics are more meaningful than most albums of any time at all and this one is no exception.
B000I9YWDO|5|Very funny and worth the watch. If for nothing else, to get the quotes that everybody seems to know!
B00L9B7IKE|4|I liked the story, but it starts slow. However, towards mid story it really picks up the pace and it kept me on edge.
B000FS9FCQ|5|Haha... I just liked the movie because it challenged me intellectually, contrary to other Hollywood works... It also included a piece of Beethoven's 5th which I was playing in my school orchestra at the time. But overall the idea developed in the story just blew me away.

0062059963|5|The Selection was the book everyone was talking about in 2012. I mean, who can resist a poofy dress and some drama? I certainly couldn't. And so I read it, despite some of the controversy surrounding it. I came out loving it to pieces! And then I had the good luck of having an ARC of The Elite appear in front of me. But would I love it as much as the first?<br /><br />Yesiree!<br /><br />Where do I begin? The Elite was just as fun as the last one, but with a new maturity to it. There's still plenty of the silliness and drama, but the plot is thickening. Things have been narrowed down, the stakes have been raised, and soon the final decision will be made.<br /><br />I loved the way the competition was progressing. With it narrowed down to only The Elite, the girls have more responsibilities placed on them, in the form of reality-show style challenges that reminded me of shows like The Apprentice and Design Star (I don't know how intentional that was, but it was super funny!) We also got to see how the girls act with one another, knowing that if they aren't careful, they'll be picked out!<br /><br />And now...the boys.<br /><br />Let's start with Aspen. He's kind of a jerk. And he's back in the picture. A strange coincident landed him as a castle guard, and so he and America are running into each other quite frequently, leading America to reevaluate her feelings for him. But he hasn't changed at all. He's still a jerk!<br /><br />I'm kind of conflicted when it comes to Maxon. I loved him even more than I did in the Selection and then he did some things that didn't sit well with me. Or America, for that matter. These were the brief moments when America wanted to go back with him, and I almost agreed with her. But then he went back to being all amazing and I'd forgive him for everything. By the end I was swooning like crazy over him.<br /><br />America is a difficult character. She's very independent and strong-willed which I admire, but she also doesn't think things through and is indecisive, which can be very irritating. She also seemed to be pushing people away from herself, which really affected her relationships in the book. In the end I think I really liked her, though.<br /><br />The writing was a vast improvement to that in The Selection, which made for an overall more enjoyable experience. Kiera is definitely an author I look forward to reading much more of (especially if Maxon is involved).rough and is indecisive, which can be very irritating.

0439023513|5|Peeta has been captured. District 12 has been completely obliterated. And broken Katniss wants to see the ashes that remain. So with Gale at her side she ascends from the depths of District 13 to her former home. President Coin and the rebellion need her, and she's not cooperating. But maybe this will help Katniss consent to being their symbol of freedom, of uprising, of defiance: the Mockingjay. Of many questions she has, why now after excluding her from the planning, and is this really in her best interest and that of Panem on the whole? Burying her fear and anger, Katniss realizes the success of the rebellion is on her shoulders regardless of the cost to her and the people that matter most.    Being honest, I'm still in disbelief. Disbelief that my first experience of Mockingjay is over and sadness that the series has come to an end. After a late night of happy and nervous anticipation waiting for my copy, I spent the next night and two days frantically reading in the biggest doses I could manage. I wanted to read fast and just as the previous two books, Suzanne Collins made it impossible not to. As a result I was left exhausted in all ways and a little numb. I knew the war to follow would be dark and heartbreaking, but I was still taken aback by how quickly and pervasively the violence, death, loss, and heartache accumulated. That's not to say Mockingjay is without its moments of humor and tender exchanges, but this is heavy material.    As has been constant in the series, Collin's signature plot twists and turns are here, and more than ever I was guessing wrong and finding the buildup and conclusion not as I had imagined or expected. While I thought a few minor decisions were uncharacteristic, the ending is real and the direction fits the story and characters. Epilogues can be hit or miss but this one was perfect. The last few pages in fact were understated and beautiful and beg for a re-read. Overall Mockingjay was a bombarding, emotional, mind-blowing read that can't get much better.
B000PMLFRA|1|One disc bad.
B0055V6EZE|5|I practically worship Hugh Laurie for all his talents. That being said, I didn't even know this album came out until I bought my calendar for this year. I wrote a review for that too. Yeah, a review for a calendar. I don't get why it's necessary either.<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't realize I liked New Orleans style blues until I got the album. Love it. Swanee River is one of my favorite songs now.

B008476HBM|5|I chose to read this novel because I felt it obligatory to read a classic piece of literature. However, I was surprised by how engaging and thought-provoking it actually was! Read it for Austen' s mastery of the English language; read it for the love story and drama; read it for the character development; read it because it is so readable, accessible and beautiful in every way.
0061950726|5|Wonderful book...Let me know about a segment of American history that I knew nothing about..  Excellent book.  Judy M.
B007HUD6OS|2|More of a kids book. If you read all 4 Grisham simply says the same thing in every book about Judge, the dog, Ike,m, the uncle ,and almost every other character. Good Author, very weak product
B00000IQV7|5|Loving humanity is the theme to this story.  Was such a heart warming and sad story.  Robin Williams was wonderful.  I've seen this movie before, but for the price I had to add it to my collection of DVD's.  Watched it after receiving it and will be watching it again and again. And this was a true story of one man working very hard to bring joy and comfort to his fellow man. Ordered this dvd and received it in a few days...thank you Amazon.
B00N35P5MW|3|fun but stop asking me to rate you.

B0031TZ8TU|4|This was a fun book to read.  I was aware of the characters and the crisis but not all the detail Ken Follett provided. It made for an interesting book and one that adds to my knowledge of the times and the people involved - especially Ross Perot.

B00LU0P9L4|4|Deeply absorbing!  Great graphics and storyline.  Would love the option to explore the ships sans game play.  Reminded me of Myst, but with enough ease of progression to keep the game from being frustrating.  Maybe the progression was a little too easy; finished the game over the course of 2 days.  The only thing that frustrated me was the fact that the backward button sometimes took multiple attempts to work.
B00N1JQ2UO|5|This is a great movie.  It's funny and the soundtrack is the best.  I can't wait for the sequel!
B00DJSUORE|5|One of my top albums perhaps because there's a kind of controlled energy found throughout the tracks that's different from their previous albums and unlike many other &#34;rock&#34; CD's I've heard to date. Somehow, At the Drive-In found a way to make screaming at the top of your lungs on every song blended with hardcore into a sound that's harmonious to those who can hear it.  And although there are those who would prefer the subtler, more mainstream direction the Mars Volta took, I still think At the Drive-In and Relationship of Command represent what an alternative band and album is supposed to be.
B008QTVNUI|4|It makes the CIA and  FBI look like a bunch of gangsters our vice president like a heartless monster and al quiada as a bunch of good family men who are misunderstood. This whole series could have been written by al quiada. Well thats HELLYWOOD for you.How come these foriegn actors can play americans better than we can very well acted and the scripts are interesting and well done, to bad it has such a anti American slant.
B00COGY2P2|2|Not memorable!
B008SAZHLQ|5|It's nice to read something beyond the ordinary, and with a romance that's not ridiculously fabricated. Love the characters, love the chemistry, love the story. Worth the read in this young bookish girl's opinion.
B00EOGZ42U|5|When this first showed up as the FAotD I wasn't going to get it.  A friend said I'd enjoy it, and he was right.  A few sleepless nights feeding my addiction and I had it beaten... and started over searching for the things I missed the first time.  I thought this game was just fast enough without requiring frenzied action on my part.  The background music is fairly pleasant and I really like the volume change as you zoom in or out.  The only thing I think will make this game better is if I get a larger instrument to see everything at once.  The graphics are quite nice, but when you're playing on a cell phone, it is not often you get to view those nice graphics without losing an asteroid.<br /><br />Edit exactly two months later to say I need five more stars.  I've begun to use this game as a form of meditation.  I can play the game all night and feel refreshed after just a few hour nap rather than a full night sleep.<br /><br />I almost never keep playing a game over and over:  Play it once to beat the game, maybe a second time to find the things I missed the first time, then move on... NOT this time.
B0035JRUZQ|5|This is one of my all-time favorite movies.  I have seen this movie so many times I can practically recite the dialogue.  John Wayne is at his best in this film, and it is nice to see James Caan in one of his first film roles.
B000EYK4KI|3|I already bought the first release of the movie and liked it. I bought this unrated version thinking I would see more of Brad and Angelina \\"together\\" - but there's really only 30 seconds or less of extra footage of them..oh well :- -
B009B08LJ2|4|One of my favorite films!
B0034JKZ86|4|My daughter liked the movie but wished the prince was african american.
0765338149|3|Highly recommended by a friend.  Purchased prior to movie opening in November.  Good read in the beginning, slows down in the middle but is picking up again.  Do not think I will be continuing the series or any other books from this author due to his political leanings and rumored bigotry.
B000EOTAM6|5|I do not understand why this movie tanked at the box office.<br /><br />Great action, an engaging story, smooth direction, good special effects, and Charlize Theron in tight clothes; what more can you ask?<br /><br />But seriously, Aeon Flux is a great film and shares some interesting similarities with a sci-fi movie from long ago: Blade Runner. Wait, before you groan and move on hear me out:<br /><br />Both are set in post apocalyptic futures.<br /><br />Both are filmed with a 1940ies style.<br /><br />Both are dealing with the issues of death and what it means to be alive.<br /><br />Both movies end on an uncertain, yet hopeful note.<br /><br />...But everything in-between is, intentionally, different. Technology in the world of Aeon Flux is almost organic, society lives in a utopian world, architecture is all smooth and curved, and everything seems to be in harmony with everything else until you dig below the surface. The best example of this is the total absence of view screens; anytime someone watches a video of something it looks as if the video being reflected off the surface of water. Its great little touches like that that give this movie a unique style.<br /><br />Charlize Theron was amazing in the lead role not just for her believability but for the amount of stunts she did on her own and the training she went through. This was her first film after Monster and, while she had lost the weight, she wasn't in good shape when she got the part. It took months of physical training for her to be healthy enough for Aeon Flux, and her dedication and hard work shows.<br /><br />Watching this film the second time was even more fun; with the plot twists all known I could focus on the extra touches that I didn't consciously notice the first time around - How Aeon's jagged, anime-style haircut set her apart from the smooth, curving society around her. Camera angles and dialogue pauses that hint at the secret that this utopian world was built on. Subtle biblical references to the expulsion from paradise... If I go on I'll start spoiling the plot twists.<br /><br />This is an enjoyable film that works on every level.le biblical references to the expulsion from paradise... If I go on I'll start spoiling the plot twists. <br /> <br />This is an enjoyable film that works on every level. <br />
0385504209|3|I don't generally read mysteries, but after much nudging from friends I decided to take up the \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"  It's not the 'Holy Grail' of books that many claim it to be...but it is a fun and easy read.  The symbology and theories explored inside are fascinating.  It's what makes this book.  Unfortunately  the characters do not.  Robert Langdon is written as such a weak and apathetic hero it's hard to really like him.  But if character development takes back seat to easy plotting, this book is probably your bag.  I could have done without all the good guy vs. bad guy, foot chases, gun firing, and plotting to take over the world action, and just stuck with a really good book on  hidden religious symbology and half-cocked conspiracy theories.
B00006F7S4|5|I certainly don't have time to review all cd's but I felt this becoming one of my favorites deserved a plug.  From the first notes of \\"The Golden Age\\" this album sets me at ease. It always takes me to a calm place where my anxieties melt.  I know Beck changes with every CD and reinvents himself but I can't say I liked all Incarnations. In fact I can leave Odelay!  But I urge all of you who know something good when you hear It to get this CD. Just awesome \\"Lost Cause\\" another highlight.  I love songs like \\"Think I'm In Love\\" from another Beck CD \\"The Information\\" but as an flowing CD this Is his masterpiece In my opinion.  PS I have the DVD surround of It. I highly suggest It If you have surround sound. Engulfs You
B00HJ92QTI|3|A bit unrealistic, but what else can you expect from a sci-fi movie.  People had these high expectations and immediately throw 2001: A Space Odyssey in comparison.  We get it...nothing can top \\"Kubrick's masterpiece\\".  Nevertheless the movie got right into the dramatics from the very beginning up until the end.  Clooney's character was Clooney himself up in space.  Bullock on the other hand had little or no dialogue.  It wasn't some sci-fi geek movie, nor was it some spiritual journey although they showed the Buddha in a quick scene, but that's open to interpretation.  It was your typical survival story....It was the movie \\"Castaway in Space\\"....predictable? Slightly.  Entertaining?  Yes  Scenic?  Absolutely.  I wouldn't have minded paying 12 bucks to see this on the big-screen.<br /><br /> *SPOILER* I'm glad it ended where it ended without going into some long drawn out ending of her doing the media rounds and reconnecting with Houston control.<br /><br />ps.  How this won Best Picture is beyond me.
B007ZGO7EM|5|This is a very good so. There are son  ad  but they aren't really noticeable. The function  work and the number  are big the are easy to see. This  I  my favorite calculator to do basic math on like when I'm shopping

B007PT3QOQ|5|Different than Tiny Village this app keeps you engage at all times.  With tasks that doesn't ask you to pay money or long time waiting periods for you to see the results, the app just keeps you guessing which makes it more addictive fun!  nice job guys!
B000EULJLU|5|Not to say that Tool is a phenominal band, with very complex rythmic chords, creative overtones, and layers of detail creating a very harmonic balance, but over the last few years, their talent on the strings and drums seem to be slowly decaying.  But with age, comes maturity.  This is a very well written album, probably their best one as far as lyrics go.  Definately not near as good instrumentally as say Undertow or Aenima, but as you definately saw in Laterus, their lyrics are amazing.<br /><br />APC was a fun side project, but Tool is back and just as good as always.  While one APC, Maynard experimented with a lot of new elements, and The Thirteenth Step was a decent portrail of his vision, but it was still nothing like the perfection of Laterus.  Tool is  his true calling, and there are definately some very powerful tracks.<br /><br />If you are a fan of progressive rock, Tool, Maynard in general, or just like to hear a wide array of talent, this album is a great add to your collection.  Also, the CD case is awesome.  If you look at it in person at a store or something, you'll see what I mean.  Tool has always had really fantastic CD cases, but this goes a step beyond.  It almost looks like goggles, and there are photos inside that look really sweet when you look through them.  With Tool, this isn't a gimmick, it's a bonus, so enjoy every minute of this full length album!

B00IRMTTPU|5|This movie was something completely different from other slavery movies.  It actually showed the realization of free intelligent black people and how they lived. My 17 year old watched this movie with me. He said the movie was powerful,  educational, and enlightened him on history that is not taught at school. The actresses and actors played the parts so well you felt their characters and the pain. Great Movie!!!

044024238X|4|I've never written a review and I thought I would write one for \\"the Undomestic Goddess\\" by Sophie Kinsella.  I just finished reading Can You Keep a Secret? and I decided to find another one of Kinsella's novels to read and this one sounded really interesting. And it was. I fell in love with the characters and the story. I love Sophie Kinsella's writing. It is just a fun chick-lit read.  The ONLY problem I had with this book was that fact that it should have ended sooner than it did. It seemed to drag on at the end and I just felt like the character was struggling TOO much. I found myself just wanting to be able to put the book away and have it be done, when at the beginning I did not want to put it down because I loved it so much.  In the end, it was still a really good read and I'm glad I purchased it.
080017948X|5|I loved this movie which was, in my opinion, a mini-course in Buddhism.  For &quot;day&quot; read &quot;lifetimes&quot; as Phil is reincarnated again and again until he has learned his lessons and, through the giving and receiving of healing love, is freed from further incarnations. Great acting, great screenplay, great fun!

B001NLKXK2|5|Excellent read. When my mother had a stroke a few years ago, it was Lisa Genova's book Left Neglected that helped me understand and better assist in my mother's care. Still Alive is that kind of book. A must read for patients and caregivers alike. Kudos to Lisa G. for giving these patients a voice and caregivers a better understanding of what their loved ones are going through.
B002L5EA4O|5|My sister used to watch this movie every morning before she went to school.  It's just a cute, funny, romantic movie.  And yes, I do love Robert Redford!!
B00006BTCA|4|I wish i could give this 4 and a half stars.<BR>This is a great album, and by all means by it.<BR>The only reason I refuse to give it a five is because this band has a lot of potential and they can do much better than this album.  Near the middle of the album a few of the songs become monotonous (THEY SOUND THE SAME) which is annoying.<BR>If they drop the silly sounding voice and plunkity plunk guitars like they want to rip off the already awful sound of the Strokes, and stick with the spacey guitar, glowing voice, then they will do great.<BR>Forget the STrokes, the Hives, White Stripes, The Vines, that sound sucked the first day it was created. Puke.<br />Interpol needs to stick with bands like Radiohead, NEU, Coldplay, and artists like David Bowie.
B003EYVXXW|5|Great historical video that is very true to history! Well worth it.

B008JFUO0Y|4|I started watching this film, and going into it wanted to personally loathe it. But this remake is one of the better remakes that I have viewed in a while. The storyline is a little different than the original but it still piles on the gore. All fans of horror film and The Evil Dead should definitely view this one. It is still a lot of fun.
B00MASEK74|1|Capaldi's debut was great, but the pricing is absurd.<br /><br />The pricing makes my eyebrows cross....
B00HZ3C4N6|1|Director Kenneth Branagh should stick to acting.  Lame story, filled with &#34;that would never happen in the real world&#34; stuff.  The whole thing is an insult to Tom Clancy and the memory of the great Jack Ryan character, RIP.  I should have read the reviews before watching but the lure of getting it for free with Amazon Prime did me in.
B000HL2J0G|5|This was one of my favorite shows when I was young. That hasn't change. Watching MacGyver coming out with real-live tricks was really educational while he goes about town helping people with problems. It was a show loved by young and old. Earlier season was better than later ones though.

B0000DJE9R|5|Came on time, great gift to my mom .
B000007WNN|5|Wow the Cult one of my favorite bands! Where to start? Ian Astbury, and Billy Duffy two amazingly talented and inseperatable musicians. The cult started out as a english underground rock band with punk roots and as they gained popularity Ian it seemed was constently being influenced by the world around him, changing his views and musical direction which apparently Duffy didnt always see eye to eye with but nether the less stuck it out and played his part well. After gaining most of their attention in the goth genre with songs like Santuary, and Here Comes the Rain , Ian again changed course and became infactuated with the American Indian culture and again another album.     The Cult came to the attention of American rockers with Electric and especially the song Love Removal Machine. Its my understanding that the popularity of ACDC and their style highly influenced Ian and Duffy to write the songs on Electric , leaving their mostly gothic roots and fans behind and entering into the pure rock genre. After reading this I highly agree, this is indeed a new Cult we were dealing with here. New music new appearance and a growing amount of new fan support, that more than made up for the saddened gothic fans who felt left out on Electric.     This is the best Cult album ever and it shows off both Astburys vocals as well as Duffys great guitar work. The only thing missing from Electric are the two songs Fire Woman, and Sun King from Sonic Temple. Fire Woman has one of the most amazing lead guitar works of all time, has anyone else not noticed that Duffy is almost constantly in lead all the way through this song. It belongs on Electric.     If you could only have one Cult album besides the Hits which does a great job of covering the Cult discography, Electric is the one to have hands down.
0439023521|3|I will keep this brief and spoiler free. I've only read the first book. It's an interesting concept and an entertaining, fast-paced read. As an adult, I did find it thought provoking at times, and it was definitely capable of evoking an emotional response.<br /><br />However, I don't think these books should be marketed towards children. I have much younger siblings, and I can tell you for a fact that these books are spreading like wildfire among 9-12 year olds at their school. Personally, I think they're completely inappropriate for children of that age, and I would be very upset if my 7th grader was required to read these books by their teacher. If you are a parent, I would urge you to read all of the books in this trilogy and carefully consider whether your children are ready for the dark, adult themes and explicit violence before allowing them to read these books.

B00008PC2O|5|My dad and I have always watched these movies together. This DVD was excellent quality for a cheap price.
0143116177|2|My guess is this book was partway written when the subprime crisis hit. In the early sections, there is good history to read. But then there is a rapid switch to the current recession, and the book ceases to be history and becomes a rehash of the news. This is clearly signaled by the author's assumption (in these later chapters) that his readers are financial experts. He becomes nearly incomprehensible. My goal in buying this book was to learn something about finance, since I firmly believe in the educational value of history. And I did learn a few things, but not nearly as much as I had hoped.

0679731725|4|It is told in the first person about the life of a excellent butler.  It really made me think of my work ethic.  It should be the same today.  It is also about interpersonal relationships with family and people we work with and how respectful we are of them and our bosses.
B00005JLKB|1|I will admit, I was excited when I first learned this series was coming out. Then I saw how the characters of Superman and Clark Kent have been butchered within this show. SMALLVILLE is in fact just another teen drama taken off the shelves but given exceptionally bad Superman aspects. The show is about a teenager struggling to find his place in the world and working way too hard to fit in with his peers. Except this teenager happens to be Clark Kent, the future Man Of Steel, living in the small farm town of Smallville. The show started well, with the arrival of Ka-El and being taken in by the Kent family. Then it jumps forward in time to a high school freshman Clark Kent all mopey about how he doesn't fit in with the popular crowd, and how he just can't get his dream girl Lana Lang. So the pathetic Clark goes off to a bridge where he ponders about life and mamages to get hit by the crazed driver Lex Luthor. This is where the series finally unfolds. Clark being the super human that he is, is unhurt as Lex's car takes them both off the bridge to the water below, and Clark performs a daring rescue of Lex who is uncouncious from the car crash. Later, Lex feels indebted to Clark and also very curious to how Clark was able to save him. So Lex forms a friendship with Clark but also launches an invesitgation on him. From then on the series consists of Lex's research and delicate friendship with Clark, people with their own agendas to disrupt life in Smallville (some have been infected with traces of Kryptonite rocks), and everyone dealing with personal struggles within their lives. These personal conflicts are what takes up most of the show, Clark performs some heroic action towards the beginning and end of each episode but most of the episodes jus deal with characters' sucky lives. I may have been into this if the characters had been more Superman oriented. Clark should have been this major nerd with glasses, incredibly shy, but very interested in the ways of the world andpolitics. This interest would have led Clark to his future career as a reporter. Being a nerd is Clark's way of hiding the fact that he is Superman and has powers that hardly anyone else around him does. That's part of the fun of Superman; seeing Clark act like this major geek in order to throw people off in discovering his true identity of being Superman. Throughout the season, he should have gained his powers, learned how to use them, and then Clark should have gotten a call from his father Jar-El. This call would have led Clark to realize what good he could do as the individual that he is, and thus he would have become Superboy. EXCEPT, THIS NEVER HAPPENS. Clark is just another teenager struggling to be popular and not a nerd at all who is interested in the world and politics. Clark in this show is way too cool and I'm sure that appeals to the female fans out there. But if he is ever turned into Superman, the story won't be as believable as before in having people not making the connection of Clark being Superman. So for most of this year Clark is running around, trying to hide his true personality from others so that he can fit in, but still helps people without their knowledge because they happen to be distracted by something else at the time. SMALLVILLE is a great dissapointment in its regards to Superman or Superboy for that matter, because it takes forever for those aspects to arise. Most of the show is just a teen drama with Superman and Superboy characters in it. I am so glad that there is now another Superman film out that shows how Superman characters should truly be used.
B001AW9DKK|5|It seems folks have had a LOT to say about the politics of<br />this CD, sooo...let's get to the MUSIC!!! The album starts off with a rousing<br />acapella version of Crosby's \\"What Are Their Names?\\" from his first solo<br />album released in 1971.This song is STILL relevant.Neil has created<br />a \\"Living with War\\" piano introduction that was not on his album of the same name.The melody without the vocals is very haunting and should<br />add greatly to the film(which I have NOT seen). There are eight songs from LIVING WITH WAR and seven various CSN songs.It proves to be a good mixture.The threesome add a lot to Neil's LWW songs and he, in turn, adds his muscular guitar tones to their songs.When  the\\"Wooden Ships\\" intro comes on,Crosby does a fantastic job on his part.I wait to hear Stephen and then....NO STILLS!!! It's  Nash who sings Stephen's part!!!That was a little disappointing... but the song still worked. When Stills sang \\"For What it's Worth\\"  he sounded fine but the mix on his vocal was so low I had to work to hear it. There wasn't a problem hearing the mix on his guitar playing...he sounded like the legend he is.As the soundtrack to the film of the same name,this release serves up more music than the film  probably will.Lucky for us.As someone else wrote recently,these songs make you think.When's the last time music made you do that?
B00A8ECU24|3|it is ok. the money you need to spend for rarity is just stupid. this game is good for rich people tho.

B000063V8R|4|By it's third season, \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" was, undoubtedly, a great series.  Some of the series' finest episodes were made during this season and it is considered to be arguably the finest season of television the people of Star Trek have ever done.  That said, it's still a bit of a shame to see them not pull out all the stops for the DVD release - the format that's made for bells and whistles.<br />Aside from the twenty-six episodes of the series - for which there is little reason to go into detail here given the large number of other reviews that discuss the episodes in detail - the seventh disc of the set features four extra segments - a season overview, a look at the changes in the crew in Season Three, and two \\"Departmental Briefings\\": this time around focusing on episode production as well as the usual \\"Memorable Missions\\" segment.  They're all great segments and they do a great job of bringing the behind-the-scenes community to life.  These segments especially illuminate what Michael Piller - who would go on to be one of the most influential backstagers on \\"Next Generation\\", \\"Deep Space Nine\\" and \\"Voyager\\" - brought to the show when he signed on board that season.  Much of the interview footage was shot new for the episode and it highlights and gives anecdotes for many of the episodes.<br />All that said, though, the set - as with the previous two - seems to be missing something.  There are no episode commentaries, no scripts, no storyboards, no deleted scenes, and no TV ads.  While much of what would be covered in some episodes' commentaries is in the extras segments, it would still have been very nice to see a play-by-play analysis of \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\" or \\"The Best of Both Worlds, Part I\\" - or even \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\" by Executive Producer Rick Berman and the aforementioned Michael Piller - or by Michael Okuda or Jonathan Frakes or any of the other Trek actors and creators that make the show so great.  Likewise, there must be an absolute ton of material in the vaults - segments cut for time, episode promos, screen tests, etc. - that are still waiting to see the light of day.  To really wow us with a box set, it would have been nice to have more of that in here.<br />Nonetheless, this is still a wonderful DVD set and certainly worth owning - even by the casual Star Trek fan.  As many others have said, Season 3 was the breakout season for the show - it's worth having on DVD.

0316286850|5|My product arrived in a timely manner, well packaged, and in the conditioned promised. I was very satisfied, and would buy again.
B007TK77QE|5|I felt I really NEEDED to write a review to help redress the mediocre rating this book currently suffers from. I almost missed out on the pleasure of reading this book due to being put off by its 3*** rating . I enjoyed this book more than even The Cormoran Strike books which I also loved. Don't be put off...it's a super read :)
B00001W9G0|5|What can I say, if you love these actors, love romance, with a little politics thrown in, sit back and enjoy one of the best movies ever made!
B006LSZECO|5|A friend recommended this book and she was right,  It kept my attention well,  The ending was very different than I expected but really, it could not have ended differently,  Do not read the ending first,  You will ruin it.
B000GU471C|4|Really stands up will for a 40 year old film.Great plot of twist and turms.<br />If you've never viewed it . Do.<br />Rich
B006O5Y75Y|4|I really liked this movie.  It was a lot better than Planet of the Apes.  You will really like this movie.
B00BFBSV72|5|My grandchldren playing this game
B006VFLIYK|5|I didn't see the endgame until the end. A good read with good characters and a believable plot that kept me turning the pages.
B005FLX2WC|5|I never (and I mean never), take the time to write a review for any Cd's I buy, and I have bought a bunch (over 700, had over 500 records at one time, and a couple hundred cassettes). I couldn't play a musical instrument to save my life, but I have listened to a lot of music in my 50 years on this planet. With all that said, I understand that my opinion probably doesn't mean all that much. But I did want to say that I love this recording. Been listening to it non-stop for five days now. If you like blues rock and/or soul R & B, you will probably like this. Hate to use the word wonderful...but that is what this release is. Wonderful, full of life, and just plain good, from start to finish. I just hope Joe B. and Beth get together again. Because her vocals, and his guitar work are a real \\"match made in heaven,\\" as they say, and us poor working folks haven't got a whole lot to look forward to these days. I bought this Cd on Monday, and today is Friday...it has been a good week. Might give yourself a lift, and check this one out.
B00D7Z4GQY|5|I had purchased this book a while back, but recently just bad a chance to read it. I'm so glad I did. It's so different and I really enjoyed it. Great summer read for sure!
B000007XUQ|5|Anyone who loves Christmas movies must own this collection. I am in my 20's and I absolutely LOVE the Carpenters so this was a no brainer when it came to purchasing this.
0553582038|1|This is the worst read in the series thus far.  Characters from the previous books are pushed off stage by an invasion of new characters accompanied by ponderous descriptions of their family tree, their history, their  plots, and their exploits.  Martin says he omitted old characters on purpose because the book was getting too big - yeah right!  I think the editor forgot to strap on Martin's reins and he went trotting down his favorite path - tangents.  Martin brings characters into a scene and then launches a laborious epic about a character's history or relatives.  Good fiction has good pace and the pace in this book is glacial at times.  It's a great book to practice your speed reading as you vault over the parsley searching for the meat.
B00KMXQIYM|5|Fantastic series! Last four eps best ever! Highly recommended.
0061353248|5|Dan Ariely stops and makes you think about the situations in your life that apply to these common behaviors. Whether we realize it or not, many of our common everyday problems could be solved by taking the time to understand why we make our decisions. The studies and examples he provides throughout the book give every reader a story that they can relate to and easily understand the concepts of traditional economic theory.<br /><br />A very interesting read for personal and professional development. I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in learning what forces determine people’s behaviors.
B00992CF6W|5|great
B000EHQTZO|5|The movie itself is so famous that no additional praise is needed.  I found no fault with the single-disc DVD.  The box claims Commentary is available during play, but I rarely enjoy this during a movie, and did not test it here.
B00N6PD3GE|4|A very well detailed and organized account of the voyage of the two boats that would eventually lead to the U.S. Entering World War I, the Lusitania and the U-20. This book tells the story of the captains of these two ships, the extensive background of the crew and passengers of the Lusitania and the U-20, and the main factors that created this horrific encounter.
B006885LZM|5|I missed the interviews with the actual surviving men, like in Band of Brothers (although I realize that there are very few left with us). This series is a well told story of men who's cougar and sacrifice can never be honored enough.
B009UX2YAC|5|Great game. My Grandson loves it. Hours of fun and tuning of his fine motor skills.
B00006F7IM|5|Fun movie about baseball players who get a second/last chance. It's not Shakespeare, but who cares?
B0097EWK3A|5|This is a top rated game that is challenging and a lot of fun. The storyline is both fun and interesting.
B00IJJUIMY|4|It was a quick read. I hate to see Harry go. Somehow I think Connelly will figure out a way to keep him around.
1439181780|5|if you want more  scientific evidence, then i recommend reading the intention experiment and read the research in heartmath.org! your heart does omit an electromagnetic field more powerful  then then your brain. i see how feeling is more important then just simply thinking positive. emotions fuel  the energy of your thoughts, so if you want positive thoughts then change your feeling. and the heart is where you feel.
B0032CVAQQ|5|This is a very quick read and it is definitely worth it. I think you have to be living under a rock not to know about the concepts in the book but hearing all of the examples and applications really brought the ideas to life. One cannot read this without being motivated to improve their relationship with their spouse. For that reason I give this five stars and look forward to improved &#34;love tanks&#34; in my marriage.
B00006V9A0|2|I haven't even bought this album and I already know how pointless this release is. I feel proud that I am the only  person here that didn't waste my money on this album. Then again, I feel ashamed because I am such a big fan and I don't have it. But hey - that's what they're trying to do. This is only a release for the big Nirvana fans so they'll be drawn into buying it otherwise they won't feel like a true fan anymore. I have every Nirvana LP and a bunch of their singles, along with countless bootlegs and rarities. None of this stuff is new to me. I suppose that some of the new fans would like this, which is why  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But anyone who is getting acquainted with the band should buy their earlier albums such as Nevermind, Bleach, In Utero, and Incesticide. There are a lot of great songs missing in this release. To name a few: Love Buzz, Big Cheese, Downer, Aneurysm, Dive, Molly's Lips, Polly, Drain You, On a Plain, Serve the Servants, Something in the Way, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle, Even In His Youth, Verse Chorus Verse. <BR>In addition, Nirvana wasn't exactly anything special when they started playing. They were a live punk band. They got lucky enough to go from underground to the big music scene. Any band could have done it around that time. True, they were a great band. But they weren't the Beatles. They simply played the right songs at the right time at the right places. Because Nirvana was an underground band and although they were classified as both \\"grunge\\" and \\"pop rock,\\" their true spirit was that of punks. If Kurt hadn't killed himself, he would've when this release came out. Just look at what Nirvana has turned into. Nothing but a bunch of legal documents and overpriced Greatest Hits Records.<BR>Like I said, I would recommend their earlier albums if you are starting to listen to them. If you have been a big fan for years, listen to these songs on the CDs you own already. Download the new single. Go out and buyan underground CD! Who knows, the band you pick up may be the next Nirvana.
B00A1EOBJQ|5|First Class album, if you watch the series you'll love it, already pre ordered Volume 2.<br />Will be ordering the DVD too
B00001NFCY|1|This is THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPILATION OF TRIPE I'VE HEARD SINCE BRITNEY SPEARS!!!  Creed are uninspired, unoriginal Pearl Jam wannabes....  To me, Creed represents all that is wrong with music in the last ten years and Creeds fans are like so many mindless drones; sheep carelessly off to the slaughter of creativity and free thought.  I shudder to think where the human race will end up traipsing off to blindly follow this pathetic, wishy-washing, inane dribble.  Did someone say sanctimonious posturing?  AMEN, BROTHER!!!!
B005CRQ4XI|5|I am not a hiker or a camper.  But this book captured my imagination and had me hooked.  Cheryl writes with eloquence and humor.  It's a book I will retread.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Overall a good little game although I found the pics a little small for my Kindle ,I would not recommend playing on a smart phone!. Probably better on a tablet or monitor. Story line a little juvenile, watch your health points, they go fast!.
B0015AARJI|4|worth it. the dual shock draws you deeper into the game. also feels better in your hand due to the weight of the dual shock controller compared to the none-dual shock.
B00OALBUZY|5|Great movie
B0060D11OU|5|Wonderful movie ! I could watch over & over again! Julie Andrews is a wonderful actress with unbeatable charm. Simply delightful !
B008XG1X18|4|Awesome! Love it....and highly obsessed with it :)  I do have issues with it having to force close A LOT, but I'm hoping an update will resolve that issue SOON.
B00003003R|5|While this double cd set may be a said memory of a band that imploded under pressure, it is also a thrill ride, hightlighting a band that dominated their time.  While it was recorded across the world, geffen did a great job of making it feel like one big show.<br />Disc 1 kicks off with Nightrain, a fast, adrenaline rush thatwill get you jumping around the house. Next comes a AFD classic, Mr. Brownstone. Its an average version of the song, but the highlight is the 2 minute soundclip of Axl trying to get the crowd to back up  after the song. Next comes another AFD classic, Its so Easy, which is a thumping reminder of the bands past. Next comes the <BR>GnR trademark song, Welcome to the Jungle, featuring a heart pounding intro by Axl. Next comes a underrated song sung by Izzy, Dust n Bones, which is by far better than the recording. Next comes the song My Michelle which on record was a dark song, but live seemed not quite so intimidating.  Then you get You're Crazy which features a monotone sounding Axl.  After that you get one of Gnr's most controversial songs, Used to Love Her, with a funny yet disturbing intro. Then comes the only Lies hit, Patience, with a very excited crowd that sings along louder than Axl. Next is It's Alright as an okay intro to the monster hit, November Rain, which ends CD 1 on a nice note.<br />Disc 2 starts with a boring version of Out Ta Get Me, then a better than recording version of the ever ironic song, Pretty Tied Up. Next is the happy song, Yesterdays.  Then you get the low point of the set, Move to the City, which includes a 5 minute solo section by the unecessary horn section. After that the rest of the cd is amazing, which is the reason of my rating. You get You Could Be Mine, Rocket Queen, Sweet Child O' Mine, Knockin on Heavens Door, Dont Cry, Estranged and Paradise City.<br />While disc 1 is aimed for the hardcore fan that knows the songs that werent hits, disc 2 is aimed for everyone with a run of monster hits. Any Gnr fan, hardcore or casual should definetely pick up this set, which hightlights the last great rock band, Guns N' Roses.
B00P5968FC|3|decent movie, but very B.
B007J4T2G8|5|I read this book while at work and finished it as quickly as you can while reading at work. Given the story line is a little far fetched for the average person, but i guess that's what you want in a story, something more exciting. The sex scenes were steamy even though in real life i'm not personally into this particular kink.
B004XJRQUQ|1|Good book<br />Hope more people read this book hope you guys like this have fun reading really hope u guys like
B000QCS8TW|5|This book is truly amazing. I love every part of the story. I would definitely recommend this book to a friend.
B00AYR2FOI|5|I have listened to Boz since the early 1970's and have owned every album he has put out.  This is amongst my favorites, he just gets smoother, more soulful and better.
B005LAIHRC|5|This is so over top and cheesy that one can't help but love it!  80s rock!
B0051HNMTI|5|Like the other reviewer, I started with the free app and moved to the paid app.  I like the variety of exercises and how the app counts down each exercise for you.  I bought all the exercise apps in the set (cardio, butt, legs and arms)
B007J4T2G8|5|Who does not love this book? It opened up a whole new world! Can't wait for the movie! Best book ever!
B00Y3IOI7G|5|I am a long-time fan of the Mystery Case Files games.  I own them all and never get tired of the challenge they bring to the brain.  As long as they make them, I'll buy them.  They have yet to disappoint.
B005V2EVBQ|4|Aesthetically, the case is very pleasing (black). It's slim and looks very nice. The case fits very tightly and does not allow the device to move at all. I'm also a big fan of the elastic band to keep it closed. I prefer the elastic band over any magnet or clip. The overall quality of the case is pretty good. My only complaint is the \\"stand\\". When folded as a stand the case is not very sturdy, but as long as you have it sitting on a completely flat desk it works well. Oh and also a screen protector would've been a nice extra, but hey... beggars can't be choosers I guess.<br /><br />P.S. To people with greasy fingers: the material on the outside of this case easily picks up fingerprints, but is easily cleaned.
B000FC146C|5|This is a richly complex and very long novel.  I watched the movie adaptation with Richard Chamberlain in the leading role and it was a pale imitation.  This is a surprisingly wonderful book.
B00688628M|5|It is an excellent series.  All of them.  Unless you are squeamish about war.  It depicts what our WWII veterans experienced.  Throughout, some of the actual veterans comment on what happened.  Very worthwhile.
B008PQ8XZK|5|The author had me spell bound until the very end of the book. A very interesting and most enjoyable read, a good story that had me guessing until the end.
B000OCXMAE|1|This record is a turd...don't waste your $.  I'm almost embarrassed to be a fan.  Good thing I can still spin Hybrid or Meteora if I want a good kick in the balls.  If you like your Linkin Park sissified, this is for you.
B00B4VI8MQ|4|I have enjoyed this game. The over all look and feel of the game is excellent. The only thing I wish they would change would be the added ability to make the hidden object screen ever bigger when you pinch the screen. These old eyes aren't what they used to be.
185984054X|3|Hitchens' critical exegesis of the late mother Teresa is short, elegant, polemical, but undeniably circumscribed. His introduction is a weak precursor to an otherwise provocative examination wherein he `proves' that the footage the Catholic church employed as evidence of divine light was a fabrication. This doesn't seem particularly surprising.<br /><br />Underneath Teresa's efforts was not an effort to further the total quality of life of the world's poor, but rather, to further the ends of the church, which never seeks to fully emancipate the poor in any enlightened sense. Hitchens quotes Teresa to the fact that<br /><br />\\"There is always the danger that we may become only social workers or just do the work for the sake of work...It is a danger; if we forget to whom we are doing it. Our works are only an expression of our love for Christ\\" (pg. 31). Theresa's work was a `fundamentalist religious campaign' but it was also a campaign that sought support from well known fascist slime.<br /><br />Then we find Teresa's fierce propagation of the church's pro-life stance. She says, \\"today, abortion is the worst evil, and the greatest enemy of peace\\" (57). Pro-Life Catholic dogma may also prove to be the main cause of the aids epidemic in the southern hemisphere today.<br /><br />Turning to page 67, one finds one of the few slices of documentary evidence Hitchens manages to provide, an order from Teresa seeking clemency from Charles Keating, wherein it is shown that she received large sums of money from a well known fraud and swindler. Is this immoral? Or is it an inescapable facet of organizing public institutions? Hitchens believes the former. You can decide for yourself.<br /><br />On Teresa's involvement in Guatemala during the contras aggressive war against the leftist Sandinistas (which she consistently blasted), she stated, \\"everything was peaceful in the parts of the country we visited. I do not get involved in that sort of politics\\" (pg. 93). Hitchens is right to point out false sanctity, but like his trial of Henry Kissinger, he tends to microscope the individual's crimes and failings while neglecting to address the larger structural and institutional features that allow that precipitates the behavior and allows it to flourish.ight to point out false sanctity, but like his trial of Henry Kissinger, he tends to microscope the individual's crimes and failings while neglecting to address the larger structural and institutional features that allow that precipitates the behavior and allows it to flourish.
B00005NWLO|4|First off, this is worth buying just because of the rarity of a live performance. This is one of the best live rock bands to ever pour whiskey on stage (more on that later). These guys were the warmup band for The Who until The Who noticed that people were leaving before they came on. Flat out, one of the alltime American rock bands. They cover some songs on this album that are not on any studio albums. What is disappointing is that this could have been even better. The sound mix sounds like the guy mixing it got far too loaded as the concert went on, and the mix gets worse as it goes along. In addition, the band got completely [drunk], and as the concert goes on, their playing suffers. At one point, Van Zant can't remember the words to a song, and you can hear one of the backup singers say \\"Whiskey, Baby\\". It's still a great album, but so disappointing that they were not at their best due to pouring down a few hundred gallons of booze.
6305265666|5|Barrymore shows great depth in this character.  This is a Cinderella story for the woman of the 90's.  A woman who can rescue her man, and yet be vulnerable.  This is a must see film!  Enjoyed by both men and women.
0553583182|5|If you want to subdue your demons, this is the book.
031623480X|5|Very informative and full of such wisdom about one's eating habits and how to begin eating properly and in turn to begin to feel healthier.
B008602KQI|5|The DVD arrived in a secure box. The DVD was protected and package sealed, it was just like purchasing it from a local music store but in the comfort of your home. Cannot get enough of the movie.
B007SYWFRM|4|I got this game cuz I thought it would be cute for my toddler and I started building the community for her to test it out and I'm really enjoying it. Its not complicated at all and pretty much keeps you with goals to reach. I'm only at level 11, but so far it hasn't stuck me with any tough goals that require ridiculous anoints of coins or experience.
B00EMXBDMA|4|It took some time for the story to make what was, at times, very high schooler-ish writing bearable. Once it did, though, I couldn't read fast enough.
B00ALYY6ZA|5|This diet is one that fits my lifestyle and is easy to follow and it works!  I am recommending it to my friends.
B00IX9UTLU|4|I actually liked the characters and cared whether they got it together or not.  A good read and the sex didn't get monotonous.
B002SJIO5E|2|In the finale, the accidentally infected hybrid human is still waiting for his extra-terrestrial ally to return from it's home-world with a cure!<br />A sequel would be interesting to know if the e.t. was honorable, to fulfill it's promise for the only available cure...<br />District 9's special effects were great but, the plot was very depressing regarding the humans wanting to selfishly exploit the alien weapons technology and some of the aliens identified as criminal thieves that were stealing from innocent human citizens their private property computers! The greedy, power hungry father-in-law of the accidentally infected hybrid human man, was total scum for betraying his family (daughter and her husband), to exploit the alien's military technology for his security company's weaponry research & development department. Also, the South African &#34;person of color - i.e. black&#34; criminal gang's boss was both comical and pathetic, to think that eating the e.t.'s flesh would give them the ability to activate their acquired alien weapons, to bypass those weapon's security safety measures! The human guys buying sex from the alien prostitutes was repulsively depraved (y-y-yuk)! To think that e.t.'s with advanced military technology would possibly not be benevolent but, criminals instead is very depressing! I've always hoped that if first contact were made, that it would be peaceful and remain that way!<br />A sequel could counter balance the first movie's negativism, by being very optimistic where the aliens (don't have a prime directive policy of not sharing technology) but, are extremely generous! Good diplomatic relations by beginning with healing the infected hybrid man and far,far more could result! The moral of the story, is you shouldn't judge humans or an e.t. alien specie by if they're physically attractive or not but. instead by their ethics! Cool, huh-h-h?
B00AFROVQC|1|This is one series that you can avoid. Very shallow character development, combined with a completely predictable plot and pervasive spelling and grammar errors makes these books really hard to get into. The series should be named &#34;The 'I Owe You One' Series,&#34; due to this phrase being repeated so often throughout the books.<br /><br />In a large body of writing, a few spelling and grammatical mistakes are forgivable, but the quantity present in these books is very off putting. Whether it's the confusion of their or there, or our instead of are, each mistake is a burr in the fabric of the story, and there are just too many to ignore. There was also at least one instance where the author quite obviously used the wrong character's name. All in all, it's just sloppy.<br /><br />The plot is nothing you haven't seen before. It is almost possible to read the first page of each chapter, make some guesses as to what is about to happen, read the last page in the chapter, and confirm your assumptions. Everything in between is generic action and dialogue.<br /><br />These books cost very little for a reason, and even a couple bucks is a waste of money.
B000I9WWHW|5|Love this movie.  Miss Robin Williams soooooo much.
B0006N2EZ0|5|It is a shame to admit, but I did not purcahse this movie until after the death of Whitney Houston. I had watched bits and peices at one time or another. Finally watched it all! Enjoyed it so much, I ordered one for my friend.
B004LWZW7Y|5|I really liked the movie, but I was glad I wasn't watching with kids. Explaining sex to a classroom full of 3rd graders wouldn't be fun.
0634022296|4|This is a great book to have, either by itself, or in addition to the complete scores. I use the complete scores to cobb together a solo guitar arrangement, an example is the piano part in Obladi-Oblada, which lies well on guitar. Then, to practice, I play that part as I peek at the easy-to-follow chord and lyrics in the Songbook.<br />I, like others have done, took the book to Staples and had them spiral bind it for about $10.00. I feel the publisher should have done this--otherwise the book has little practical application. If they had bound it more conveniently, I would have given this product 5 stars.
B004LWZW4W|5|Excellent movie!
B005ZOBNOI|5|Run, do not walk, and buy this book!!  Its topic sounds gruesome and negative and downright depressing.  But for those of us who have known this life, it is an affirmation of all you think you knew and all you wished you could have said to your loved one.
B000Q6GUW0|5|What can I say besides that this is one of the best shows on t.v. right now. I watched only 4 episodes before I decided to purchase the first season. Dexter is a smart, funny, and dark at the same time and you cant help but to love this character. This season is strong and will leave you on the edge of your seats while you get closer to the final episodes. This is a must buy, a must see, and a show that will stay with you for a while.
B0062NAX1U|5|This film was amazing. It made me laugh, it made me cry, but most importantly it made me commit to being a better mother.  The spiritual aspect was great, though I would like to see more spirituality in these films than is normally portrayed.  It even made a good impression on my kids.  They like seeing films that support their own Christian convictions because they don't get too much support in that area with most of their peers and out in the world.  It makes them feel that they aren't so strange after all and supports them in continuing to walk the walk with Jesus.  We are looking forward to the next film by these amazing folks!
0811879631|4|The Art of Pixar is a high quality book that will leave you amazed at the artists hired by Pixar. The styles and colours contributed and the artworks will make you want to grab out your own colour pencils and do something.. Pixar-like. ..
B000002MG1|5|This CD changed my life.  I bought it nearly 15 years after it's release at a difficult time in my life, and it was a steady, true comfort during that period.  Spending time uncovering it's layers reminded me about beauty even though things were dark, and repeat listenings of \\"Automatic\\" along with the events of my life taught me so much about empathy.  I can't recommend this CD more highly.  I wouldn't be the person I am without it.  It's a masterpiece, and my favorite album ever.
B006OV7RQ4|4|The psychological study \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene\\" is one of the more fascinating films of 2011. An independent critical hit, the subtle drama details a young woman's attempt to adjust to society after years in a rural New York cult. Using the word \\"cult\\" awakens memories of David Koresh ([[ASIN:0815605021 The Ashes of Waco: An Investigation]]) and Charles Manson ([[ASIN:1560253967 The Family]]), and first-time writer/director Sean Durkin has created a quietly menacing atmosphere recalling both cultural disasters.<br /><br />The film's main character, Martha, joins the cult commune, where men and a larger number of women work the fields of an isolated farm. Existence is anything but sunshine, as days are overcast, laughter kept to a minimum and thunder roils on the horizon. The cult's leader is Patrick, skillfully played by John Hawkes ([[ASIN:B00498TQV8 Winter's Bone]]) in yet another role displaying why he's one of the more fascinating talents working today. He juggles word games in seductive Mansonesque manner, discussing death as ultimate nirvana and acceptance of his family's system as the only true love.<br /><br />Martha's time within the cult is seen in flashback. The film opens with her escaping through the woods as she stumbles to a pay phone. She's soon residing with her older sister Lucy (Sarah Paulson) and brother-in-law Ted (Hugh Dancy) at their palatial lake house where they are vacationing, sleeping more often than not, unable to discuss where she's been for the last two years. With some trepidation, Lucy and Ted become Martha's protectors, and it's apparent their status-conscious lives have left them ill-equipped to deal with the depth of her mental warfare. A professionally successful Manhattan couple, they're shocked by Martha's uninhibited behavior as she casually goes skinning dipping and enters their bedroom while they're having sex. Martha also has an embarrassingly violent episode during a formal cocktail party.<br /><br />The passive yet complex role of Martha is brilliantly played by newcomer Elizabeth Olsen. The film is seen almost entirely from her viewpoint as she struggles from paranoia, with dreams of her time within the cult seeping into daily existence. Through reoccurring flashbacks we witness her indoctrination, including forced sex with Patrick and a variety of home invasion crimes. At night she imagines cult members throwing rocks at her window. Like a scarred soldier, Martha is mentally shell-shocked. When Lucy attempts to indoctrinate her into their own society, shown by the clothes provided or the makeup painted onto her face, Durkin is obviously creating a parallel universe of opposing yet oddly similar values. Both are defended passionately. When she questions the need for such a large lake house overflowing with material possessions, she is thoroughly chastised by Ted during a fit of anger. When she voices unhappiness about a crime committed within the cult, she is threatened by Patrick in a similar outburst.<br /><br />During conversations with Lucy throughout the film, we learn Martha was a school dropout, without parents, making her a perfect target for the cult. We can't help but recall the infamous Manson girls, identically dressed with shaved heads, marching to the courtroom in unison. We read Vincent Bugliosi's [[ASIN:0553278290 Helter Skelter]] and see the films ([[ASIN:B0001AVZM6 Helter Skelter]]) where Manson is the dramatic focus. I'm not sure we've seen a work dealing exclusively with a female cult victim and how she begins to follow beliefs opposing American society.<br /><br />We could question Durkin's intentions when comparing the veiled similarities of respectable society to the cult's sexist and violent existence. When Martha is forced to take tranquilizers after her outburst at the cocktail party, we are reminded of the drugs used by the cult during her indoctrination. There's also intended irony in the film's final conflict, when Lucy realizes Martha needs serioushelp. She is to be committed to an institution where she will be cared for and reprogrammed to learn new morals and values, which is exactly what happened within the cult.<br /><br />Let me honestly say I hated the ending of \\"Martha Marcy May Marlene.\\" With contemplation, I realized it was imaginings within Martha's damaged mind. She's unable to swim or even drive down a sunny street without seeing ominous signs of cult members nearby. Martha was traumatized, akin to veterans of war, and has a long way to go before escape. Where Durkin goes a step further is by asking, \\"Escape to what?\\" A uniquely haunting film, beautifully photographed, that will get under your skin.
B00004R99F|5|Love this movie. It is about the last day of school and summer break trip.  I show this to my students as a treat on the last day of school.  They always love it.  Just upgraded my VHS copy to DVD.  I also had this part of our family routine at the end of the school year.  The last day of school we made homemade sundaes, and watched this as a family to kick off our summer.  My daughters are in college and still love it.
B0036B8MXC|5|The first couple of episodes are over the top, really cheesy and almost made me not carry on.. but after that WOW with every episode this show gets better and better.  Yes, there is a lot of nudity and sex and blood and violence, but it is just an awesome show.  Many episodes have had me at the edge of my seat, even standing a few times shouting 'OMG! NO!' ... give it a chance (if you like this time of show) you wont be disapointed!
B00IJJUIMY|5|I love Harry Bosch. I have read all of Connelly' s book and he gets better and better. Keep writing Micheal Connelly.
B00KG2OZIU|4|Good movie.

034580404X|2|Okay..
0679805273|5|Purchased these items to give to our high school and college grads at church.  GREAT item at a good price shipped in a timely manner ... and the kids LOVED them ... THANK YOU!
B000002OVJ|5|I am trying to find out who or what &quot;Happy Jack&quot; is in the song by that title by the gruop, The Who.  The words to the song do not make any sense as to what or who or what, maybe, it is symbolic of.  I thought at firsttrying for the words to make sense I thought &quot;Happy Jack&quot; was a hermit crab, but it says in the song he &quot;wasn't old, but he was a man.  Or can you help me to find out where or who I could contact to find this out.
B00BUCXVPI|5|This one is a keeper. Excellent story line and execution. More stories available by books.
B000FCKGPC|5|Another terrific book this is my fourth time thru a song of ice and fire and it seems to get better with each read
B004O3YGMC|5|I got it when it was the free app of the day, read the description and decided to try it. It's a lot of fun to mess around with, and I have a few pranks in mind to pull. It works pretty well on my HTC. I didn't think it would work, but it is. The controls are a bit hard at first, but after, it's easy to use.
B001IUBZAU|4|Having been intorduced to AC/DC (along with rock and metal) at an early age I have always been a big fan and when Blac Ice was released I had to run out and buy it right away. Now a lot of \\"Classic\\" bands release new albums and we get a mediocre album to a slap in the face, well I am happy to say that this isn't the case with Black Ice. Sure it isn't quite Back in Black, Highway to Hell, or the Razor's Edge but it is still a very good album and definetley worth the buy with songs like War Machine, Anything Goes, and Skies on Fire and honestl the whole album is enjoyable. So if you're a long time AC/DC fan on a new fna buy this album you won't be disappointed
B001FA0H3E|4|a great read. Gunther Bachman is the George Smiley of this generation!
B005T87QCI|5|Cool dont listen to the haters
B00M1SRBS8|5|This my Favorite CD...... I Love It !!!!
0452273331|5|Anthem, the fountainhead, and atlas shrugged are 3 great stories for the shelf.  Easily the most influential female writer of the last century.
B00EOGZ42U|3|This game is reasonably fun, there is a decent story driving it, it works well, it looks good, but its just so much work to play it.  There's a 1-2-3 speed rating and I can't imagine playing any slower than 3.  You end up having to take over 10 + planets and have to keep changing where they send their seedlings, and it takes so many 'clicks' to do all that...
B00EHMFC78|2|A very light read and entirely predictable. Great for the beach.
6304143184|5|PLEASE RE-RELEASE THIS MOVIE MR. SPIELBERG, AMBLIN ENTERTAINMENT, DREAMWORKS--WHATEVER!  I LOST MY COPY WHEN I LOST ALL OF MY THINGS AFTER LOSING MY JOB AND WAS HOMELESS.  HAVE SETTLED MY LAWSUIT AGAINST THE  GOVERNMENT AND WOULD LIKE TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THIS MOVIE AGAIN.  IT IS A  MOVIE, LIKE A GREAT MANY (OR MOST) OF YOUR OTHERS THAT DESERVES BEING  WATCHED OVER AND OVER.  PLEASE...
B00004R99U|5|Audiences seem to be split concerning this movie, they hate it or love it. Personnally, I loved it much more than the original which I don't own. The animation is exceptional for straight-to-video release and the songs are as wonderful, if not more than those of the 1995 flick (I have a soft spot for &quot;Where Do I Go From Here&quot;). This is also one of the first Disney movies I actually rented before buying it. This story, although still historically unaccurate (Pocahontas is supposed to die a few days after they go on the boat *There won't be another sequel*), is very cute and has hilarious moments. In my mind, it would have been a hit in theatres. <br />This movie is remarkable and well done compared to many Disney sequels. Let's go over them with my ratings:<br />The Return of Jafar: I hated it 0/5<br />Aladdin &amp; The King of Thieves: Not too bad 3/5<br />102 Dalmatians: Same story as the remake, wasn't it enough!! 0/5<br />Little Mermaid II: Same story as the original except Melody (Ariel's daughter) wants to go the sea (Roles exchaged). 1/5<br />Lady And The Tramp II: Same story with Scamp (son of Lady &amp; Tamp) agian with roles exchanged. Very poor animation! 0/5<br />Fantasia 2000: Lives up to the original although I didn't really like the pieces that were chosen, but for wonderful animation 4/5<br />The Rescuers Down Under: Good, I loved it when I was young. 3/5<br />Beauty &amp; The Beast Xmas: Great holiday movie and wonderful songs 4/5<br />More Beauty &amp; The Beast videos that weren't hits 0/5<br />Coming Soon (Ooh, lucky us!!):<br />Dumbo II<br />Cinderella II: Dreams Come True<br />The Hunchback of Notre-Dame II<br />101 Dalmations: The Animated Sequel (We have enough already!)<br />Peter Pan II: Return To Neverland<br />Why keep messing with our memories, anyway, we know now that Disney is just a company that's losing money and taking the most they can out of their classics by making sometimes-absurd sequels! And there will be more coming,I'm sure, so much for Happily Ever After! As long as they don't mess with my favorite, Sleeping Beauty, a masterpiece in animation that doesn't want a sequel.
B00JP5GRVM|5|One of Ben Stiller's best to date!<br />There is a lesson to be learned in this excellent movie about how one can dream and achieve if one has the patience and perceiverence to do so.
B00BEIYH1A|5|Good movie.
B00DUGCLY4|5|makes you want to keep figuring out the words to the pictures.  challenging.  good clean full! !  really fun for the brain.
B00CH26TL8|1|yadda yadda
B00E8KLWB4|4|I like the game though I agree dat Der is dis energy crunch every now n then but Der is a positive side to it u don't play d game on n on. Therefore don't spend all it wake hours on it😂
0780018664|5|All the reviews I've read here are so good that all I can add is the image of the balloon floating in the air.
B0055PMURG|5|This movie was so inspirational, It really moved me to see how Bethany kept surfing even after her accident. She is definitely an inspiration to us all.
B005LAJ23A|5|I love this show, I love everything about zombies. This season in particular was a little slow in the beginning but it picks up with a great ending.
B001E25MBK|5|Killer set.
0425180638|1|I swore after I read Black Notice that I wouldn't buy another one of these.  This will definitely be my last.  Take the same story line as her last few books and add more sex and violence and there you have it.
0307277887|5|Darkly Dreaming Dexter is the first in the Dexter series by Jeff Lindsay.  The series is a firsthand account of America's first \\"likable\\" serial killer.  Dexter only kills bad people...and his point of view is so original that it's impossible to not have a fun read.<br /><br />The story focuses around the mysterious Ice Truck Killer who kills people by disassembling them piece-by-piece.  At the same time he's engaged Dexter in a clever game of serial-killing one-ups-manship.  Will Dexter save the day before someone close to him dies...by his own hand?<br /><br />The Dexter character has also translated well to the Showtime series which is a great example of black comedy done to perfection.  The novel and the series do share many similarities and some important differences (character deaths, unexplored plotlines).  Thus you can read Dexter and watch Dexter and still get the maximum amount of entertainment value.  This is a great character who hopefully will have a very long shelf life.
B000IJ79UW|5|Christopher Reeve takes us up, up and away with a legendary performance as The Man of Steel in this must own four disc special edition. It's great family friendly entertainment. Also recommended for every Superman/comic book movie enthusiasts or those who aspire to become so. This item is as advertised and arrived on time.
B00005JKHN|3|ok
B008JDAC7G|5|Very fun game, I played for an hour straight right after downloading it!
B00BIPCY14|3|Good cast;but, too many cocky lawyers.
B00985E3UG|5|Thank you, Michael Moss, for one of the most well researched, scientifically based, and informatively written books I have ever read.
B00A9T1HUO|5|Another wonder singer and I also have a large number of his albums.  Makes me feel good every-time I listen to him.
B00EL8I8IS|5|Great movie
B00JXXX8RM|5|I don't have a whole lot to add to the other very articulate reviews about The Road of Bones except that it is one of the finest albums IQ has ever recorded. Now I know there may be some disagreement here but to my ears this is their Piece de resistance. I thought Frequency was going to be near impossible to top but is it possible to rate an album 6 stars?!<br /><br />At times TROB has a definite Genesis feel to it. While I hate to have to compare IQ with anybody I simply cannot avoid the comparison on some of the songs. Mike Holmes does sound a lot like Steve Hackett at times and the new keyboardist Neil Durant definitely emulates Tony Banks on many songs. When Paul Cook hits a cadence not unlike the Phil Collins of old I hear a definite Genesis vibe to many of the songs on TROB. (Although with a bit harder edge.) This is most evident to me on the epic 19 minute \\"Without Walls\\" and \\"Until the End\\" on disc 1 and \\"Constellations\\" on disc 2.<br /><br />Many songs have a \\"tried and true\\" IQ progressive format with a quiet, even soft beginning then expand to a wonderful full symphonic sound reaching somewhat of a climax and then easing off once again to a softer sound to end the song. However, this format, while sounding formulated is treated quite differently on songs where it is used giving each song its own unique feel.<br /><br />This album is as good as it gets in today's symphonic progressive music. It will have to be a contender for album of the year.
B0082SU98U|5|It's a classic, I have read it by my moms recommendation and it's worth it.
B009477BOI|5|Wonderful family film. Just wonderful! We love it, all characters and songs and props.<br />My last kids are 4 and 3 and they both love it.
B007SYWFRM|5|I'm a huge Ice Age fan so this just fit the bill perfectly!! I absolutely adore it - it's addicting, though. *grin*
B00079HZUM|5|Great acting and a powerful script. Don't miss this one.
B00CATSONE|5|I found this book to keep your interest in it.Teams was a great man who has given the world so much.And it's sad that  in the USA our own schools don't teach more information about him.
B00DA6YEKS|5|In Brandon Sanderson I find an author in the ranks of Robert Jordan, Orson Scott Card, and yes, even J.R.R.Tolkein. Such authors can hold us spellbound without resorting to sex and gratuitous violence to titillate the reader or make him skip those pages to get on with the good stuff. Discerning readers who love epic fantasy should feel very glad to find such an author still turning out the best in the genre.
B00KNWYDU8|5|Good game but requires patience and a lot of Dragon
B00005QDW5|5|This collection showcases three decades of a band whose work puts most other groups and individuals to shame.Few rock bands have ever been as good at crafting a piece of music as Pink Floyd.Most so-called artists today could not write one song as good as &quot;wish you were here&quot;or &quot;time&quot;.Their music has incredible textures and evocative moods.&quot;Shine on you crazy diamond&quot;is one of the true (and few)masterpieces to emerge from the legacy of rock and roll.There is so little talent,ambition or record label support today for Floyd type projects to emerge.Worst of all, groups today consist mainly of people who have had no musical training or understanding of music theory ,so what you have are a bunch of two chord playing garage bands who scream and pound away endlessly and offer nothing that bears repeated hearing.Music must have subtlety,cohesion and real craftsmanship if it is to last and give delight even with numerous listenings.Pink Floyd has all this in spades.Occasionally they veer off into all too typical rock and roll pomposity,but the overall quality of their catalog is as good as anyone's.Highly recommended album as are &quot;Dark side&quot;,&quot;The Wall&quot;,and &quot;Wish you were here&quot;.
B00GRVEDCM|5|Fun. Game kills time love the turn base attack  good card game a definite must for rpg players and you don't have to spend money too enjoy
B007NG93CK|4|Reichs remains true to form and at a level way above the corny television series. For those who have liked the previous books this one is sure not to disappoint.
B00IS87HYI|3|It's okay but not near as much fun as Candy Crush.  It passes the time and is another game to play but it just doesn't measure up to Candy Crush.  I'm not too far into it yet (I believe level 15) but it's not a game I just can't wait to play and for me it just isn't that much fun.
B001UTW7QU|3|Sick to death of the domineering know-it-all woman lead characters. (What i call Tomb Raider syndrome) usually accompanied by the passive whimpy guy sissy boy who couldnt survive without the  &#34;big strong woman&#34; seen in comics, movies, tv, video games, etc. Which this is pretty much another example of, will NEVER rate higher than a 3 out of 5. Other than THAT, shows not bad, gets a little dull at times with the chase the bad guy for 10 minutes scenes. Pretty cool story lines
B00CATSONE|5|I think every college - no, high school - student should read this book.  I found it fascinating and true to MY experiences.  The first part about imagination and success was excellent and I am going to have my wife and 12 year old read it.  I very much enjoyed the way Tesla's life was discussed.  This was a biography which was to the point and made the point of the first part of the book very well.  It was easy to read and very interesting.  There is a lot to learn about life.... this book helps.  READ IT!
B00AIUUXHC|3|I love this game attack the people and eat them can not get any better
B00102FELM|5|I am completely speechless after watching this fantasitc dvd. I was blown away by this performance(especially Uli Roth's performance , which I thought stole the show, I won't ever bag on his singing ever again.) And it is always great to see Michael Schenker play with them as well. It is a shame that four tracks were omitted from the show (one being \\"In Search of the Peace of Mind, from my favorite Scorps album \\"Lonesome Crow\\"), but this dvd is definitly a keeper. This show will blow you off your feet.  And it's great to see them cover songs from  RCA days.
B00DJFIMW6|5|This game is really fun. It cheers me up, I don't know how, but it does... I recommend this game because it's a way to make time fly by. Also it's free!!!!!!!!!!!
0545425115|5|Hunger Games is about Katniss Everdeen, a young girl who lives in District 12. Her father died at a young age, and from then on she had to take care of her younger sister Prim and her shocked mother. She snuck out under the electric fence that borders the District, and hunted for food using her bow and arrow.  At the Reaping, which is the time of day where they select the tributes, Katniss's sister is chosen to be in the Games. Knowing that Prim knows nothing of survival, and Katniss is more skilled in hunting, Katniss offers to take her place.  The rest of the book is about Katniss preparing for the Hunger Games and the Hunger Games itself.<br /><br />-The book is a very eciting book and very easy to get into beccause of all the action that is in it.<br /><br />-It takes place in the usa after world war 3 when every thing got destroyd.  the charicters in the book are pritty real to me because its just a girl that has been hunting her whole life so she has become very well with the bow and arrow but the boy isnt very real to me because in the begginning of the story they dont really talk about what he is really good at, and then all of a sudden he is this strong kid that we havent seen before.<br /><br />-i thought it was very cool how they rubbed a little lotion on the injury and the wond was gone the next day but it was to fictitious.<br /><br />-this was probibly the best book i have throughtout the whole thing and it is a great book for all ages to read<br /><br />-this book is good for every that can comprehend the words, and its a book for both male and females<br /><br />- 5 stars
B00EZ50SGW|5|Watch both of these back to back for best effect, Brilliantly put together, they are basically just one long movie
B00J59ZKV6|5|I really loved this movie. I have actually seen it 3 times already. It seems that, each time I watch it, I see something new. The only thing I didn't really understand was the fact that the only people over say around 25 were Trisses and fours parents and Kate Winslet. What happens when the kids reach like 45 and over and can't jump from trains anymore? I wish they had gotten into that a bit more,
B0086700CM|4|it's pretty cool and a really fun filled game to pass the time when your sitting around waiting on things to get done
B00005JMX4|3|THE GIRL NEXT DOOR follows in a long line of recent teen [adult content] flicks that focuses more on the bodies and less on the storylines.  However, that's exactly why many of the men were in the audience in the first place.  After an incredibly slow start, some laughs do eventually transpire (none of which are generated by the actual \\"girl next door\\").  Actually, her character is used more to connect the other essential players and is almost forgotten at the end of the movie.  This film barely passed the 2 star mark, but considering how bad many of the other films have been this year, it feels about average.
B00JOT3HQ2|4|This game is hard at first, but soo addicting! You have a cube and you make him jump over obstacles, trying to get to the end of the course. This is an awesome game to play with friends because you can try and beat each others scores.<br /><br />One thing I don't really like is how even the first level is challenging for beginners, but there IS a practice mode, so at least they have that. :)
B000SEIK2S|5|I loved this series.  I wish he would write more books about the universe he created.  Maybe about the building of the Colonial Union...Or the aftermath or other characters during the same timeline.
B000LPS4BG|5|I haven't been \\"into\\" films for too long now, just a couple of years.  But ever since I started watching Scorsese films they have been my favorite.  If I had to pick a film that I though was better than Goodfellas the only thing I would be able to say is The Aviator, another Scorsese picture.  I can't possible tell you what this film does while I'm watching it.  You get so drawn into the world you feel like you are know more about gangs than anyone.  It's such a fun movie with great replay value, especially in blu-ray.  The picture looks awesome (for a 1990 film) and it adds so much to the movie.  Highly Recommended!
B00K7C17QW|5|Search and find type of fun
1563898586|3|This is an okay graphic novel. It has some interesting story elements and characters but the story never really engaged me. Not a bad read, but clearly not for everyone. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is not a clear fan of comic books.
B00BVYLBP2|1|Yuck.  Unbelievable story line.
B000002UB6|4|This is The Beatles last album.  Not the last to be recorded but the last to be released.  This is the point where the tensions within the group were really beginning to split it apart.  It is incredible that they managed to record one more album after this one with Abbey Road.  This is the rawest the group had been in a long time and even though Phil Specter is producing it, his normal spit and shine polish is completely absent here even on the heavenly orchestrated songs, \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", and the title track.      Everything here sounds under-produced. Two of the tracks are just flat out segments and there is a great deal of studio chatter in between songs.  The best songs here, however, are among the most gut-wretching confessional songs the group ever wrote.  \\"Across The Universe\\" is a beautiful folk song where John Lennon dreams of the heavens the beauty of the natural world.  Paul McCartney's \\"Long And Winding Road\\" accuratly describes the group's career and all the turmoil they'd faced.  No fancy studio techinques or elaborate production here.  Just some of the best songwriting imaginable.      The group had a bad experience recording this album as well as with filming the movie of the same name.  I think that the ability to turn out quality material even if you're not on good terms with the rest of your band makes you an exceptional musician.  The Beatles managed to record this album and even another one after it.  Stuff like that makes the Beatles truly one of the greatest teams ever.
B009CG2YDE|4|I love this game, it has no investment, does not force you to return, give upgrade burdens or is pushy. I can pick it up again today or next month and there is still continuity in the game.
B00CKJ2KK2|4|An overall fun knock off of a good game (team fortress 2) put into a mobile device, extremely fun all the restrictions in game make sense.  No bugs from what I can see, still, an extremely fun game. :)
B000EHSVSC|5|Enjoyed this version of the attack on Pearl Harbor.  Good to see both sides of the invasion.  Actual war footage a plus.
B00QW8TYWO|5|So this game is funny and fun and addicting and it is all to fast one hard.
B009Z59ZNE|5|Excellent. Saw British and American versions. British is better.
B00005N9CV|1|I hate to give this CD such a low rating because I like the music (not her best but I would have rated it 4 stars).  Unfortunately, this CD appears to be &quot;protected&quot; by one of those new copy protection schemes that adds noise to the CD.<br />On my 3 cd players I could hear a clicking sound every 10-15 seconds.  It's barely audible, but now that I've heard it I always hear it.  More frustrating, however, 3 of 5 computer CDROM drives I tried won't even read the disc.<br />I hope that Universal stops this insane practice.  It completely destroys my enjoyment of the music.
B008LV8TSU|5|I am a fan of Miyazaki's film, and decided to read the book on a friend's suggestion. The book is just as wonderful. The story is wonderfully inventive and engaging. Can't wait to read more!!
B00006J3WH|5|I must say, this is probably one of the items in my Buffy collection I treasure the most. I LOVED the episode, and I was ultimately stoked when I discovered there was going to be a soundtrack. Naturally, I snapped it up the first day it arrived in stores. ;) It's a must-buy for any Buffy fan. Even if you're not a Buffy fan, any musical-lover will love this. I even find my college roommate humming a couple of tunes from it once in awhile, which she always denies - even she likes it, and sadly, I can't get her to understand the joys of the Buffyverse. *sigh* Anyway. Back to the review.<br />The fact that Joss Whedon was not credited with an Emmy nomination for this work is an insult. Of course, the Emmy people said they fixed it, blah blah, but whatever. The fact that he wrote all of the songs make it even more special. The man is definitely multi-talented - he even lends a bit of his voice to the final track.<br />However, it is the cast's voices that shine on this cd. Amber Benson and James Marsters in particular were gifted with fabulous, amazing PIPES. They make me wish Amber had a cd and I got to go a Ghost of the Robot concert once in awhile. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Anthony Stewart Head also give notable performances, and the rest of the cast isn't half-bad, either. The best song is probably &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, which includes all of the cast, plus Broadway alumni Hinton Battle.<br />The disc also includes some extra instrumentals, such as the tracks &quot;Sacrifice&quot; from &quot;The Gift&quot; - which always makes me cry - and the excellent suites from Emmy award-nominated &quot;Hush&quot; and season four finale &quot;Restless&quot;.<br />All in all, it's a fabulous compilation. Five out of five stars, all the way.<br />-- ayla
B009O2XY12|2|I tried this game because I used to love Poppit on my PC, and this was the closest I could find in the Kindle marketplace.  Because I had expected something like Poppit, I was disappointed.  I am 70, so there was nothing challenging for me.  My husband likes it much better than I do, but he hasn't played with as many computer games as I have, so it's all a newer experience for him.
B00B2V66VS|5|my kids have this game on every electronic device in the house, I even enjoy playing this game with them.
B009EEL94Y|5|my favourite movie still at the age of 24. the HD quality only trips me out even more. thanks Amazon.
B00GRHVIGU|5|This is his David's best. If you are new to Crosby's music, a fan or not you, you will still love this album. Highly recommended
B00D7Z4GQY|4|I couldn't put it down!
0743496736|5|Nineteen Minutes is the first novel of Jodi Picoult's that I have read and I was very pleased with the book.  I loved how I could identify completely with each character in a variety of ways.  I was taken back to my own experiences with bullying in school and my own struggle to fit in with the \\"right crowd.\\"  I found myself clinging especially to the stories of the parents involved and how they looked back on and forward to raising their children.  I have no doubt that most anyone can identify in atleast some way with Picoult's well written characters and the issues they encounter.<br /><br />I read through the book very quickly because I did not want to put it down and leave these characters.  Nineteen Minutes is an excellently compelling story and was a very entertaining read, but I was disappointed with the end \\"twist.\\"  I could see the plot resolution coming from about chapter 4, so wasn't surprised with how the story ended at all.
B00I8Q77Y0|5|Awesome game! I don't know why but it's much more fun than flappy bird. Download is worth it. It's much more entertaining with the various colours of bird you get. Have an excellent day!
B00CSR2J9I|4|This game simply is a good time waster, a lot of the times when I'm really bored I'll find myself coming back to it
B00HWWUR1Q|4|The Hobbit in 3D! I enjoyed this movie, and being able to watch in 3D in my home is a plus!
B00NWLIW0E|2|Whenever I want to play, the game crashes on the loading screen. Please fix quick. I don't like wasting money on stuff I can't play and neither does anyone else
B00DR0PDNE|4|It works well but don't think it plays personal content unless you upload it somewhere first...... That being said it does play all the youtube vids I sent to it, and netflix too.  I understand there are many others but only really use those.
B00005JLEJ|2|I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with \\"Kagemusha\\" and \\"Ran\\", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about \\"historical\\" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no \\"ugly\\" shot in either \\"Ran\\" or \\"Kag\\" - merely that there are more \\"authentically Japanese\\" films out there to choose from.
B00FOWX6NM|5|Great aesthetic design with great protection. My mother loved the look. Pair this with Spigen's crystal clear screen protector and you're golden!
0060512806|5|I was one of those people who only liked the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; science-fiction epics by the old masters of science-fiction books, but, after reading &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and some other Neal Stephensen books, I have come to really like the sub-genre known as cyberpunk. I have purchased and am reading &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Zodiac&quot;, and &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;, even though it's not a Stephenson book, it is a cyberpunk book. Kudos to Stephensen!
B00271HAK8|5|I watched this because everyone always talks about it and now I know why, its a great movie! I feel like older movies in general have much better plot lines and acting. Great movie, highly recommend!
B000002GB9|5|This is it, the greatest Styx cd, and one of the best cds in rock history. Not a bad or weak song on this disk. And it shows Styx at its best, as a group, and this is a group effort, from the opening title track, to the last.<BR> The first track, The Grand Illusion, is a heavy metal anthem on the illusions of life, for the rich or poor, the common man or the superstar. Come Sail Away, is the best track, about looking back on life, about your dreams. As it slowly builds from its piano opening, to its rocking ending, this song as you singing along with. Dennis also has two other songs on this disk, the mystical, and haunting Castle Walls (love the keyboard work in the middle of the song), and the Grand Finale.<BR> Tommy, also has some his best work, Man in the Wilderness, has a great guitar solo in the middle, and Fooling Yourself, with acoustic guitar and keyboards, makes for an interesting song. Superstar, is the only song that really doesn't hold up to rest, but it's still good.<BR> JY's one song, the rocking Miss America, is his best work, and the song that he is best know for. If all of this songs were like this , he would only need one song an outing.<BR> Blazing guitars, a sea of keyboards, and a wall of harmonies, all hidden behind lyics about life, this makes for a awesome concept album. The songs, all fantatic, listened to by their selves, or on the radio, cannot do the album the justice, of sitting down and cranking it up, from start to finish. GRADE A+
B00HBQWGXK|3|I have devoured almost all of the Jack Reacher novels with great joy.  However, this one just doesn't have the scope or development or complexity as the others.  The other stories always had a twist at the end that, no matter how I tried, always took me by surprise.  &#34;Personal&#34; just didn't have that.  The story seemed trite and forced.  If this had been the first Jack Reacher novel I had ever read I would not have read any more.  However, if this is your first please read the others as they are really worth it.  I should know as it only takes me about 10 - 12 hours to read one as I can't put it down.
B00F52YOPA|4|The game is enjoyable to play, not as challenging as some, but interesting to see how many points you can build up to make changes to a room.
B0017SWPXY|5|Admittedly. I am a dog lover.  So I embraced the intelligence and perception of Enzo, the canine first person storyteller.  The spectrum of human experience is revealed using professional track racing metaphors as adhesive.  Around the curves he takes us through joy, tragedy, manipulation, and victory.  He shows what makes a true champion and a true friend.  To say it is compelling is the worst sort of understatement.
B000002UAF|5|PROBABLY THERE BEST ALBUM FROM THE EARLY YEARS,THIS OFFERING WAS AND IS A ROCK CLASSIC,AND WILL BE FOREVER.THE GEMS ARE THE TITLE SONG,IF I FELL,AND I LOVE HER,CANT BUY ME LOVE,I'LL BE BACK,AND THE UNFORGETTABLE THINGS WE  SAID TODAY.THERE IS NOT A WEAK SONG ON THE ENTIRE DISC,AND IF THIS AIN'T IN  YOUR COLLECTION,YOU JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR MISSING!. THIS IS ROCK AND  ROLL , PERIOD.!

B0094BB4TW|4|I loved the app before this last update. I can't do hardly anything on it anymore! I cant even post stickers on the messaging! And now i uninstalled it hoping to help it, and  it won't reinstall!
0375869026|5|One of my favorite books ever! I think everyone should read. Covers so many subject areas and is funny snd beautifully written!
B008EKOO46|4|One of the reasons I read is to come into contact as best as possible with as broad  a range of the human experience as I can.  So, when wandering between the stacks of my city's library the World Until Yesterday caught the corner of my eye, I looked at it and was interested.  Diamond  opens the book describing his thoughts in the airport at Port Moresby as he observed today's New Guineans, most of whom were born into or are at most a generation or two removed from neolithic material conditions. Reading the prologue in bed, I looked at my wife and said, &#34;This is going to be a good book.&#34;<br /><br />And it is very good, especially in the first half.  The idea of the book is to compare the behaviors of people in Neolithic material circumstances with our modern, western ways, with the normative goal of drawing lessons for us to improve our lives.  Diamond is not a romanticist- he is very clear that modern societies offer advantages in food security, in peaceful social relations, medical care and so on.  Still, that does not mean that we haven't lost something in trading traditional for modern ways.  Diamond is interested ina  path to taking the best from both worlds.<br /><br />Along the way, he melds together detail about the lives of neolithic people from the anthropological literature with some incredibly interesting experiences from his own friendships and experiences with New Guineans, as they lived the traditional lives of their ancestors and as they adopted a modern, western lifestyle.  This approach holds true especially for the chapters on child rearing, treatment of the elderly, risk taking and warfare, and it's utterly fascinating.  Do you want to learn about, and emathze with people who are about as far from your experience as you can imagine?  Then these chapters are for you, and they're the first three quarters of the book!<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me at least, the final chapters to focus on the impact of modern social and especially materialconditions on our physiology.  That is already familiar to most of us.  For example, is it any surprise to learn that diabetes is related to obesity?  And that obesity is derived from the relationship between a physiology evolved in a context of food scarcity and a social environment of food abundance?  During these final chapters there is very little to do with traditional cultures, which is what excited me so much on page one.<br /><br />Anyways, this objection is a matter of my preference and even these chapters are written with clarity and by a supple mind.  You might find them to be the most interesting part of the book.  I learned a great deal about a completely different human experience, and if that's what you're after as well, I heartily recommend The World Until yesterday.
B005LAJ16I|5|The best series I have ever watched on TV.  Extremely well written, superb story  line,......a must for everyone who enjoys political thrillers.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Addictive, insightful & unusual. A very unique WWII story. Highly recommend it.
B002VJ0576|5|Not sure why some people don't realize this is not the slick mainstream Hollywood studio production given there is a giant T-Rex on the cover!     I proudly own this film.  I love good low budget horror, and it has a wonderful, sly performance by Torchwood's Gareth David Lloyd to boot. The effects are effective, it's very retro. I particularly loved the suit of armor.     Also it's shot on location in Wales so you have real scenery, not computer generated backdrops.    It's a fun film. I'm sure I'll play it for other people as well.
B00EL8I8IS|1|To much for me
044022425X|5|Not quite finished yet, but a great book like the others! I am so hooked on these books I can't stop reading this series! I bought the very last installment of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever a while ago, in HARD COVER because I had to have it THEN, and now it still sits waiting for me to read it!
B00DVKOYBM|4|I have only plaid a few one on one matches so far. Everything seems great however, the spin control does not work well
B003G8Y4QO|5|I liked David Tennant and Billy Piper the best so far, but the whole series so far is very entertaining and keeps me wanting to know what comes next.
B000O8OTNC|5|Works so well I bought another to keep in my hiking pack
B004XJRQUQ|5|Hunger Games was recommended to me by Kindle Shop after I purchased the Girl with the Dragon Tatoo series.  Well thanks to that I completed that trilogy and thoroughly enjoyed each one. I had never really touched on futuristic fiction but after reading this series am open to more. Suzanne Collins is a masterful story teller!
B008XKSW7M|4|Really funny with good stars. There just was not enough time to delve into the plots as much as I would like.
B00821OX98|5|Great Show!
B00HYTSTNU|3|good acting by Tom Hanks and the Somalians but I thought it dragged on and on and on and on....
B00DQEB1V4|1|I tried several apps with this pen and contually had problems with it not acccepting the writing. I contacted the vendor and they offered to send me another pen, but I decided to return it. There could have been a problem with the device I had, but I felt I spent enough time trying to get it to work properly.
0307592731|5|I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I couldn't put it down. The writing is beautiful and the journey is amazing. I loved that the story is true and highly recommend this as a book for others to read.
B00WP9HSJU|5|A &#34;must read&#34; for Outlnder fans! Or anyone who is single or has been.
B00J6YA1V4|5|Oh how I've missed Lestat. This book was the tip of the iceberg I think. I cannot wait to read more.
B000IY03DM|3|Just found this fantastic mix of voices last fall. Listen to their music most everyday while I work in my studio. Have a ticket to see them in LV next week. AS to  the Siempre CD, the choice of music is not my favorite. Ancora 2006 & their Christmas Collection 2005 are THE BEST. Awaiting their newest album, coming soon. This group has hit the jackpot in life! Very uplifting for me to hum along.
B0018M6J90|5|Frances puts on such a wonderful performance but it is a true ensemble of fine, well developed characters. I purchased this video because every time I saw it on TV I would watch it. It would stay on my mind ... Therefore I decided I must own it.
0061922315|5|The Secret Daughter is a quick read told by five people; Kavita and Jasu, the poor Indian birth parents of a baby girl, Somer and Krishnan, American doctors who adopt the baby; and Asha, their daughter.  The book covers the emotional highs and lows that are so common in any adoption plus the struggles the characters have in their very diverse lives.     The story includes the plight of India's desperately poor.  Infanticide, untenable living conditions, and the incredible contrast between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" are touched on, but the main story is the age-old one of the birth mother wondering if she did the right thing and worrying about her daughter, the adoptive mother wondering if she was a good enough mom, and the daughter wondering why she was given up for adoption.  I would have preferred there be more coverage about the world of Indian women, both rich and poor, but that was not this book.  Instead it was a rich tale of two families and two worlds connected by a very lucky young woman.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great sequel to the Hunger Games. Can't wait for the last one!
B00AKKTDJY|5|I think it is one of the best cooking games there is. if you want to just try I would get the free one first.
B0063M22QO|5|It keeps my mind working constantly.  Great game to keep your mind and memory working.  My husband and I both love it.
B0089EHWQE|5|I loved this book.  Great story, plenty to think about, easy read.
B000056HUA|2|I have to say that I am a little disappointed with this disc. L.A. Woman is perhaps the best of the Doors albums but the DVD-Audio is not very well done. After being totally blown away by other DVD-A discs ( The Eagles Hotel California, America Homecoming to name a couple) this one is kind of a dud. The surround is very artificial sounding or even nonexistant in places.<BR>There is no real advantage to owning the DVD-A disc over the cd.
B004MC8CA2|5|Such a great app! So many different Bible study plans to choose from. I've been blessed already. This app is helping me to involve the whole family. We've had a great time choosing what to study together. Definitely recommend!
B0054JZC6E|5|I like that there is a variety of games...it keeps you very entertained. I would reccomend this game to anybody.
B00FRQ32N4|1|Can't even open the app.Ads just start popping up not allowing me to play the game don't get this app it's a,waste of time
0790740443|2|Kurt speak not, no no. Brave man, though he say afraid. He save some people.
B003HARV4S|5|Mystery, illusion, and love story all wrapped into one.  This movie has some great plot twists that will leave you thinking about the movie for days after watching it.
B000SCHC0Q|5|this book explores the relationship between 2 wives of the same man in afghanistan.  although the younger is brought in because the first one fails to 'produce' (ie is infertile) the initial antagonism between the two transforms into a relationship that brings both of them support, humor and love- as they realize they are both really in the same boat.<br /><br />the writing here transports you to a different world, afghanistan.  you start to feel the women's plight being in a society that does not value them as individuals.  it examines how far one would willing to go to help a loved one.  also, personal responsibility.  overall, very entertaining and thought provoking
B001SN78JO|5|One of my favorite Jim Carrey movies
B003M6EAXM|1|accidentally purchased on amazon, 24 season 8 that I watched back in 2011.

B00AECGQF2|4|I loved this game. I was addicted. But after two weeks it got old. But my 5 younger siblings loved it I've had if for a year and they still ask to play it. I'm 12 and I suggest it for people with children under 13. It's realy fun and easy for kids.
B00QW8TYWO|5|One of the best I've ever played on a kindle
B00003CWOL|5|Kevin Smith has made some of the funniest movies out there.  The best part (with the exception of Randell from Clerks) has always been Jay and Silent Bob.  These two are worth watching in almost anything.  If you have not seen Dogma, check it out.  If you have not seen Clerks, order it now.  There is no point in renting it, you will want to own it!  Kevin Smith is one of the best talents working in film today.
B004J4WNL2|5|I believe I just saved myself years and thousands of dollars in therapy. Truly..this book, with its tender insights and well-supported claims, has done wonders in giving me a remarkably studied insight into myself, my biological constitution as well my emotional needs and inclinations... not to mention the insight it's given me into my counterparts: the extroverts in my life whose own needs and tendencies are now more accessible to me too. Science done with empathy will save the world yet.
B003O86FMW|5|My favorite book book I read it in about 4 hours the ending will shock you!!! You can really see the relationship between Katniss and Peeta grow and flourish also for Team Gale fans there is a lot more of Katniss' feelings for him and the love triangle forms. I love this book and I hope you will too!! Team Peeta!!!!!
B0045NXMJE|5|i WAZTCH mIC mACS ONCE A MONJTH.  i IS A GREAT FILM ON SEVERAL LEVELS.  iT IS A DRAMA AND ALSO A LOVE STORY.
B005IQZB14|4|Compelling.  I had another book I needed to read for a book group that I was really enjoying but I couldn't stop reading this book.
B00AREIAI8|5|In this game you can have your own virtual horse to play with. You can have horses, zebras, and unicorns! Being a horse rider, I love to be able to groom my horse and ride it without working and falling off.
B00BGZ8OLA|5|Couldn't wait to share this movie with my children. What I thought was going to be a fluff, fantasy, entertainment flick - turned out to me a deeply moving, engulfing and spiritually connective story telling that went beyond mere entertainment.<br />Gorgeous, psychedelic imagery. If Richard Parker was animated, and to what extent- I don't have a clue: graphics were totally convincing!<br />Kudos
B002LFPAUC|5|This is a sitcom I used to watch as a kid.  Just as funny now as it was then. Love John Cleese!
076790592X|5|I absolutely loved this book.  Tuesdays with Morrie, is an indepth look at the meaning of life, and how Morrie viewed it as a dying man.  As he watched his own body wither away, he was able to give great insight, and love with many around him, including his old student Mitch.  Morrie is an extrovert, and displays what the true meaning of life is to Mitch, \\"To love others or die\\".  This book has so much to say in less than 200 pages, and is definately worth reading.
B00FCQQ1IW|4|Muy entretenida , como empezó la construcción de los cruceros. Todo muy bien
B00O90PYLW|5|This review is for the double vinyl version of the album.  Absolutely love this record, both the orchestral AND the solo versions of the songs.  Recorded with the same high attention to detail as Psychedelic Pill, this album is flawless in it's production and the sound stage is awesome.  The music is definitely more of a protest record, in the vein of Woody Guthrie, not in the vein of Harvest, or other non-Crazy Horse records.  Definitely recommend to NY fans and fans of an artist that stands for something, especially the environment.
B0050PYNN0|1|not that funny
B004EPZ03O|5|We all love this Muppets movie.  The songs in the movie are awesome and catchy too.  Life's a Happy Song and man or Muppet are so funny you will find yourself singing them.
B00BQPEIT2|4|This game is great if you love the original Temple Run but want a little more colour! There are a lot of objectives and characters. My favourite part of this game is the ability to go different places such as the Dark Forrest or the Emerald City! The only problem: it occasionally freezes and has to shut down. Other than that, this is a great game!
B00FATEJYE|5|I love it it has lex and superman and bat man it is so cool i like to play it on my ps3 and phone and ipod
B00BQ1D7X4|5|Awesome !
B00AIQP9DE|4|This was a pretty good game. Not as intense as I would have liked but it was still enjoyable.<br /><br />I enjoy playing these mystery games.
B00PTB7B34|5|THIS GAME IS BEAST
0783231202|5|Movie very good, holds your attention which movies today do not do. A bowl of popcorn and your friends makes a good night
B00OTD72PA|5|Amazing game
B0037AGASG|5|I received my cd in the mail pretty quick and I love every song on this album it's simply wonderful!
B00005YXZH|2|Oh, well- Call me unhip, call me hypnotized with Top 40 playlists- Call me oh-so-un-alternative-<br />But call me someone who needs a melody to connect with a song.<br />Wilco - Tweedy - whatever - seems to have abandoned the need for connection and is railing against all things &quot;establishment&quot; to a point where he's one step from being another basement-pirate artist that cranks out navel-gazing noise that he, himself, finds oh-so-interesting in a 4am daze with incense burning, coffee pumping through his blood matched only by the nic-fit that his crumpled box of Marlboro's delivers.<br />I've been to the mountain-top, seen Wilco live, bought the last record, which still clung to some need to make accessible songs, and I felt my blood boil when Wilco's old label said &quot;Yankee&quot; was a &quot;career-killer&quot;.<br />It is...but the REM potential of this singer / songwriter needs a serious lightning bolt to keep me interested.<br />Resist the pull of the basement-pirates, Tweedy. Back to the drawing BOARD not bored...<br />Spuddy O'
B00001QGPR|3|He has a long standing music career, His own internet service, and now an awesome video game. David Bowie stars in Omikron: The Nomad Soul. I know this is a review for the CD &quot;Hours&quot; but I can't talk about the CD  without talking about the game. This is a great game with great music. All  of which was done by Bowie. I have never listened to the &quot;Hours&quot;  CD but I know that all the music from &quot;Omikron&quot; (excluding  ambient music) made it on to &quot;Hands&quot;. Needless to say I am buying  it.
0345535529|5|Love or hate the books and or TV series, Martin tell a great epic story.
B00MO21WAY|5|Will be truly disappointed when Downton series ends. Great Season.
B002T9H2L0|1|Oh Oh Oh, How could I have been so foolish as to purchase this junk.  The plot is a complete fantasy of a retarded mind.  If you like butchery, lots of blood and gore intended for humor, if you think seeing someone cut open using highly focused graphics for realism is fun, if you would like to see a ridiculous, contemptible depiction of a sensitive time in history made solely for the purpouse of entertainment and making money, then this film is degenerate enough for you. In fact, let me know and I will mail you my copy......otherwise in the dumpster it goes and good riddance.  Brad Pit, how low will you go for a dollar.
0345803493|4|Took awhile to get but when I got it everything  looked good
B00FAPF5U0|5|The more you play the more you want to advance to the next level. I have been playing this game for quite sometime and it never gets boring.
B0054JZC6E|4|This game is very good, I don't get tired of it every day because it has 101 games! This game has mostly outstanding games all around.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Great storyline, lots of fun. I would highly recommend this game! First time playing one, but I will definitely play more!
B000FC1CYG|3|Enjoyed it as a period piece but it was too long and wordy. I would not recommend it to a friend.
B008XG1X18|5|This is a great place to find ideas and anything else to make life better.  Great place to be when you're on a diet, because I find myself on here for hours and that keeps me from snacking. Works great on my kindle fire.  Thanks
B0094BB4TW|5|Love it
B000062YAY|5|2 words, BAD F**KING ASS!!!A must for ANY Slayer fan...
B00F0AAC26|5|Not exactly my cup of tea. But i must own all roots projects. They are an important enough band for the culture that you should support them in all that they do. No one will be totally satisfied all around without some diversity artistically. I am glad that this album was done to further push the envelope of hip hop/neo soul Vs. everything else musically!!! They are the new Rock & Roll!!! (Kanye voice)
0321811984|5|I have been reading Garr Reynold's Presentation Zen blog even before the first book came out. Getting Presentation Zen (The Book) was just the next logical step, since it provides all that useful information you can find on the website in a structured, readable, and easily accessible way. Four years and another two books ([[ASIN:0321668790 Presentation Zen Design]] and [[ASIN:0321704452 The Naked Presenter]]) later, there is now a second edition of the original Presentation Zen book. What can we expect from it?<br /><br />What's new?<br /><br />It's somewhat ironic that the first testimonial in the book states that \\"it's often the slim books that have the most impact\\" when the second edition of Presentation Zen is noticeably thicker than the first. 60 additional pages or 25% more, to be exact.<br /><br />At a first glance, there are still the same 5 sections as in the first edition:<br /><br />1. Introduction<br />2. Preparation<br />3. Design<br />4. Delivery<br />5. The Next Step<br /><br />On closer inspection, the Delivery section has gained an additional chapter, The Need for Engagement, which accounts for about half of the additional pages. The rest are distributed over the other chapters, some of which gained a few more pages that way. Most of those changes are subtle and you often won't notice them unless you compare both editions side by side. References to iPads and Prezi (both of which only came out after the first edition) or photos from TEDxTokyo 2011 are also signs of a discreet update. You'll also find content that Garr published on the Presentation Zen blog during 2011, e.g. from an article on the power of faces.<br /><br />The Need for Engagement, the new chapter, picks up some thoughts from [[ASIN:0321704452 The Naked Presenter]], Garr's third book. In fact, it very much resembles chapter 4, Engage with Passion, Proximity, and Play from that book in that it talks about emotions, mirror neurons, and the need to remove barriers. It's not a straight copy, though, but the same ideas re-explained.<br /><br />Obviously, this second edition of Presentation Zen is not a radical rewrite but a careful update. Things have been made clearer or explained in more detail where necessary, new content has carefully been injected where appropriate. If you know the first edition, it still feels like the same book and you're only left wondering if some specific nugget is really new or if you've overlooked it the last time you read the book. I seem to remember Garr stating that \\"It's the same book, only better\\" or words to that effect. That about sums it up.<br /><br />What's old?<br /><br />All subtle and more obvious changes aside, Presentation Zen is still THE book to read on modern presentation design and delivery. Presentation Zen is an approach, not a method or blueprint that you have to follow slavishly. The idea is to create and deliver the best possible presentation for your specific audience. And while that obviously means more work in preparation, Garr provides the encouragement that it's worth it if you want to really reach your audience. The Presentation Zen book contains all that you need to make this happen, backed up with scientific evidence where needed and supported with real-life examples. On top of that, it's easy to read and Garr's passion for his topic and his roots in Zen come across as honest without resorting to superlatives or over-the-top wording that plague so many nonfiction books by American authors. It's a joy to read and encourages you to give the Presentation Zen approach a try. What more can you expect?<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />What has been true for the first edition is even more so for the second one: If you're only going to buy one book about presentations, this should be it. It will provide you with all the necessary guidance for creating great, effective, and memorable presentations. When I'm working on a new presentation, I often open up the book at a random page and start reading.It always helps to either reinforce an aspect I was already working on or reminds me of something I need to think about. In other words, it's a great source of inspiration, even 4 years after its first publication and after having re-read it (in whole or in parts) numerous times.<br /><br />The second edition feels more \\"complete\\" now, by which I mean that the extra pages all add useful information and don't feel bolted on. The only downside, I guess, is that there's less need for buying The Naked Presenter now - but that's Garr's (and his publisher's) problem, not yours ;-) This, I guess, also answers the question what you should do if you already own the first edition. If you already have the first edition and The Naked Presenter, there's probably no need to rush and buy the second edition - unless your copy is beginning to fall apart from heavy use. But if you held back from buying Presentation Zen until now - don't wait any longer. Your audience will be grateful.It always helps to either reinforce an aspect I was already working on or reminds me of something I need to think about.

B00CKKDZ2S|5|These beautiful cards have a wonderful .message each time you pick one. The gentle music is lovely and the images are very nice. I picked one every morning to start  my day. They help me stay close to my angels.
B004EAQNO4|1|this is a very very bad movie very stupid too don't rent or buy don't waste your money ok lol
B00BP4W3WI|5|Classic, great feel good movie. I hadn't watched this movie for 10+ years and forgot how good it is. Watched it with my 14 yr old son and 10 yr old daughter and we all loved it
B00VFTCGES|1|I saw this at the show and it was the stupidest movie I have seen - or maybe the second or third stupidest cause District 11 and Cloud Atlas are right up there. I don't like to watch movies that I have to pay such close attention to in order to follow the story line. Sorry!  Rotten Tomato!!!
B005AERS74|5|I am a fan of Maroon 5 and the first one to get the records. This is my first music purchase from Amazon and I loved the experience. It was fast and effortless above all the MP3 cloud enables me to play the purchased music from any device.
B000JMKQX0|5|This is a new take on the zombie story.  The normal story focuses on one group trying to survive.  This gives you a global look at how the zombie's won the early battles and how the world came back.  Great read!
B005T87QCI|5|Driving Spider-Man games for the me know if you want to go to bed now so I can do that that is is a good day for you to come over and over and over to
B009FZHYKU|5|Any doubts are gone. This season confirmed the show and cast is great not just riding a popular theme. I hope next season is as well written.
B006VRDZ44|5|i loved the first season of this show. Anxious to see second season just wish amazon provided at no cost.  Will look elsewhere for it.
B008Y7EYSK|3|It was pretty good
B0020BUWX2|5|This book was extremely touching...I was hanging on every word attempting to guess the end result of this story...heartbreaking and fantastically written, this hearwrenching story is a must read for anyone and everyone.
B00F91SCXC|4|Thought this film would be just another c g i zombie shoot'em up, but was pleasantly surprised.  The movie wasn't over powered by cg effect and gore.  The plot was typical and the whole family thing seemed tacked on, but all in all a very good action movie.
B0064MPXFA|4|Always saw coming attraction but never bothered to watch show. watched the pilot, finished the 3 seasons in a few days.this show covers all my character expectations and depth of these characters. Everything about each show is set to almost make sure you watch the next airing! SOME BODY OF WORK! Hat's off to the writers, Hat's off to Prime!!!
B00P7PBD2C|5|Very nice family movie,  me and the wife enjoyed it with our children.
B00006ZXSK|5|If this one doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you're probably dead. I love this fairy tale. Very good casting.
B00IT7539Y|5|I am a long- time Old 97s fan and have followed them for years on the road. Frankly every album since \\"Too Far to Care\\" has suffered initially in my mind by comparison. It usually takes weeks or months or years for me to discover the genius in each new album. This album is the exception. It hit me on first listening as the tightest, most representative album of the band. An instant collection of all-time greats.
B0000C03AH|3|.....maybe.  SACD layer sounds better than CD layer; more spatial information, tighter bass and sweeter strings.    You will experience more sonic improvements, if you own audiophile High-End stereo system.   This set is especially suitable for the people who avoided DG Karajan recordings because of overly bright tonal qualities(Karajan glare).  With this set, you can enjoy Karajan/Berlin PO with decent sound (you still hear thin lower-mid range and upper-mid range harshness   with screechy first violin though).    Is his interpretation of Beethoven's music as profound and convincing as Furtwangler's?    My suggestion to you:  If you want to listen to the best Beethoven cycle, do yourself a favor,  Obtain the 9 symphonies by Furtwangler.
B00IQO403K|5|A excellent pure science fiction. Very insightful take on the Cultural movement in China. Throw in radical thinking and ETs and I'm waiting for more full length stories although some of the past ones have not met my expectations.
0553573411|5|Could not put this book once I started the series.  I was totally engrossed the lives, love, tragedies, and hard ship of the characters.  They became people I cared about and was emotionally attached to the characters.  When I finished the last book in the series.  I was depressed not because the book was bad or anything but because of a feeling of separation.  It was as if I would not ever see my close friends or family.  The hours I spent reading this series was pure enjoy for me.  I would go thru my week working long hours, basically putting up with the usual grind all while having in the back of my mind that feeling of this book and the characters I love are waiting for me at home.  When I would sit down and begin reading it was as if my reality did not exist and I was completely transported into Robin Hobb's world with FitzChivalry, Verity, Kettricken, Burrich and the precious Fool.  The width drawl that I felt when I finished this series still contiunes.  It's been 4 weeks and I have not picked up another book yet.  I miss my friends from the books deeply!
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Very good
B00J8CGU64|1|Disapointing to the max!
B00UPSUYU8|5|Great video viewer!
B00E0SX118|5|Great movie!  The grandma is hilarious, the wild child 3 YO is fun, and the son is, well, mentally challenged almost, but throw them all together with Nicolas Cage and team, and this is a very amusing movie.  I've seen it many times when I needed to distract my daughter while cooking dinner or something like this (I don't like entertaining by electronics, but it is safer than a 3 YO at a stove).  I find myself watching this movie even when my daughter has left the room to play elsewhere.
B000BCE918|5|It's nice to have this 3-CD set in your collection, since you can watch these movies over and over again.  They're dino classics, like Godzilla or King Kong.
B001QL5MAA|4|Reynolds is a phenomenal writer, and this is not an easy read. It begins \\"in medias res\\" using language that only makes sense if you stick with it. The payoff, however, is worth it. As the action unfolds in circles within circles, the logic is flawless, and the ending is satisfying enough to hook you into the next book in the series.
0439023483|5|I loved this book right away because it moved quickly and didn't linger to describe the exact color of some cute boys' eyes.  Seriously, is it event that important?  The plot moved along quickly.  The love triangle, while it existed mostly in books two and three, didn't take the front-stage-center of the story and was often used to make observations and statements about the personalities of the characters.<br /><br />The other great thing that I loved was the throwback to the Greek myth of the king that demanded children to enter the labyrinth of the minotaur.  Of course there's no victor in the myth and no minotaur in the book, but the small hints of the myths are there.  In the later books they have blatantly Greek names
B005ZOBNOI|3|If you like cute and romantic this book will do you good. It's very heartwarming and heartbreaking. But overall a good quick read.
B009LMTDL0|5|I read reviews for this book before reading it. Had it not been my book club's selection I may never have read it. After reading the book I had to wonder whether the reviewers actually read the book! This book not only empowers any women who strives for or already is in a leadership position, but provides useful information for how to negotiate and plan for your career. Since a large majority of women are in relationships (i.e. co-habitating and/or married), this empowerment also helps the family unit, and the strategies she suggests work equally for women and men.<br />There are two important tenets I gleaned from this book. It will take more women in leadership roles to level the playing field between men and women in leadership roles. The dynamics need to change such that the female gender is no longer an adjective when describing positions in the work force. Additionally, our society needs to develop a respect for both women and men as vital components of our society whether one chooses to lean into her career in the work force or lean into his career as a stay at home dad.<br />Sheryl Sandberg describes the problem, analyzes the perpetuity, and suggests strategies for moving toward greater equity.
B00MXEPCUY|5|This GAME IS ALL AMAZING BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND AMAZINGLY FUN AND ADDICTIVE I LOVE IT SO MUCH I SUGGEST IF YOU LIKE ANIME TO TRY OUT THIS GAME
B001C4CI8U|5|I got this to try the show because, aside from being willing to try any Sci-Fi series that doesn't have a lot of sex in it, the comparisons to X-Files made this a must-see.  And boy, am I glad I got it.  I started watching it by myself, then my aunt started watching them with me, then my whole family became hooked on it.  It's great to have such a wonderful series to share with them.  Here's a graded review of the episodes, with synopsizes from the booklet.<br /><br />1.  Pilot:  No living passengers.  No living crew.  A plane full of skeletal remains sparks an interagency investigation.  A<br /><br />2.  The Same Old Story:  A baby is born - and dies of old age half an hour later.  The bizarre event may be related to one of Olivia and John's unsolved cases.  A<br /><br />3.  The Ghost Network:  A troubled man foresees a bus crash that leaves its victims \\"like mosquitoes trapped in amber.\\"  A<br /><br />4.  The Arrival:  An explosion destroys everything at a New York City construction site - everything except a mysterious cylinder made of solid iridium.  A<br /><br />5. Power Hungry:  A delivery guy is his own power grid, Olivia suffers an emotional shock and Walter takes on some birdbrained assistants.  B+<br /><br />6.  The Cure:  Diner patrons get a surprise when they interact with a disoriented woman; their brains boil inside their skull.  B+<br /><br />7.  In Which We Meet Mr. Jones:  Olivia flies to Frankfurt to confront a scientist who may be the creator of a giant, genetically altered parasite.  B<br /><br />8.  The Equation:  To find clues to the whereabouts of an abducted boy, Walter returns to St. Claire's... and may never get out again.  B+<br /><br />9.  The Dreamscape:  Brief encounters:  Olivia with John, Peter with a woman from his past and a Massive Dynamic analyst with killer butterflies.  A<br /><br />10.  Safe:  Three men rob a bank vault; two escape.  The third is left behind, embedded in the seemingly impenetrable vault wall.  B<br /><br />11.Bound:  Olivia flees her captors only to confront an old foe - and parasitic slugs that kill their human hosts.  B-<br /><br />12.  The No-Brainer:  The team discovers a computer pop-up that liquefies human brains.  B<br /><br />13.  Transformation:  Victims of an airplane crash include a bizarre, spike covered creature with a glass disc implanted in his hand.  A+<br /><br />14.  Ability:  No eyes.  No mouth.  No nose.  Soon after Jones mysteriously escapes his prison cell, a normal man turns into a faceless corpse.  A+<br /><br />15.  Inner Child:  In a tunnel that's been sealed for 70 years, workers discover a feral boy who has a strange, intuitive connection to a killer.  A<br /><br />16.  Unleashed:  In a research lab, animal rights activists free chimps, dogs... and a bio-engineered beast that attacks Charlie.  A+<br /><br />17.  Bad Dreams:  Is Olivia part of the pattern?  Her terrifying dreams about suicide and murder mirror simultaneous, real-life events.  A+<br /><br />18.  Midnight:  On the hunt for a killer with a taste for spinal fluid, the team discovers that the shocking deaths may be related to ZFT terrorists.  A+<br /><br />19.  The Road Not Taken:  What appears to be spontaneous human combustion is investigated.  And Olivia learns more about the mysterious Cortexiphan drug trials.  A-<br /><br />20.  There's More Than One of Everything:  Walter's Gone Missing!  Meanwhile, Olivia tracks down the man who shot Nina Sharp and holds the key to finding the enigmatic William Bell.  A+<br /><br />I must admit that while I prefer X-Files overall, the myth arc here is constantly engaging as opposed to the mixed bag the conspiracy arc in X-Files has been for me.  Here's hoping that season 2 (which I already have, thank God) doesn't disappoint.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|It's like the impossible.game but less easier
B003JA5NUA|5|Love the show
0307271080|5|A very good novel .When you start reading it, you like to read more. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie is a good writer.
B00THRQBD2|2|To depressing
895660763X|5|Quick shipping.  Just as described.
B0097GVJWQ|5|Played it straight through on a road trip. Glad I never had to put it down. It's got a pretty good story line. Part two is going to be great.
B000000OAA|5|This is probably tied in my opinion with Queen 2 as the best Queen album.  Each album is much too different to compare, but they do share the honor of absolute perfection.  Not only are these some of the best Queen songs,I say  that tracks like Brighton Rock, Lily of the Valley, Lap of the  Gods(revisited),  are some of the best in rock history period!  Buy this  album!  Everyone needs at least one god-like CD in their collection.
B00G3L6KQI|5|I love the ending to the all Souls trilogy.  How the author was able to wrap everything up was great.
B00CSR2J9I|4|This game is awesome if you are just bored and you need something to do. I like this game but I can get frustrated with it sometimes but the pros outweigh the cons.
B00BXKKNFS|4|I have to constantly uninstall this app to get it to work and the updates will not download. Very frustrating.
B000KX0IOA|5|I think everyone has been touched by Gandhi in one way or another...whether they know it or not.  Ben Kingsly is outstanding as Gandhi.  If you want to be inspired, this is a movie to watch.  This is one of those films that is a must in anyone's collection.
B0024FAR5M|5|thank you for the fast delivery, it was a Christmas present and I was happy that it came so quick.
B004UID2LC|3|Doesn't work

B000060P79|5|Simple Plan what more is there 2 say?? Alot!! I love Simple Plan I first heard there I'm Just a Kid song and I fell in love w/ the group since then! I espcially like there songs Meet You There and Perfect. The meet You There song fits me well I feel the same way as the song is! I think every1 should and must go out and buy this cd cuz they r going 2 big and great soon!
1451629192|5|A piece of writing that won't let you put it down until the last page has been devoured. I recommend this book to anyone out there. It definitely brings the hope out in anyone out there.
B009NG1Q96|1|This mad cry it mad my smile. This is the BEST book I have read. It's better than the hunger  games
B00CNQ7HAU|3|While nowhere near engaging and 'believable' as his other yarns, I like reading Grisham because I like hearing a southern voice and gaining some insights into 'modern' morays of this culture.<br /><br />With this said, the plot was entirely predictable, as was the outcome, and the language used by every single person sounded like it came directly from the author rather than individual characters. I guess the editor was under pressure to ply his/her craft quickly to accommodate that quarter's revenue targets.
B002PZC8BM|5|All of the characters are well developed and interesting.  The lead, Patrick Jane, is a complex character full of remorse, pain, yet tender with a developed sense of justice and fairness. As an ex[con man, his shady past gives him an ability to &#34;read&#34; people which is fascinating but with a lot of humor humor as well. The antagonist ,&#34;Red John&#34;, continues to be mysterious and elusive compelling us to keep watching.
0743297334|5|Hemingway is a legend for a reason.  In this book in particular, he shows how he had his fingers perfectly on the pulse of the Lost Generation.  His characters are very realistic, as they should be, since they're based on real people, and the events of the book based on real events.  You could consider that a knock against his originality if you wanted to; I don't.  Even though you know the story is going to end with mass tragedy (it is Hemingway, after all), the road there is fascinating and the book is worth a read.  It's one of those books where you don't simply read it, think &#34;That was nice,&#34; and put it down; it gives you things to ponder, and makes you think about your own priorities and worldview assumptions, if you're into that kind of thing.
1441308660|5|I have had this product for month.  I carry my kindle everywhere.  With this case it fits easily into the outside pocket of my purse.  Great choice.
B003VVFGWC|2|Season 2 is better than season one and the characters have grown on me.  While its worth watching, its not one I would highly recommend.
B00GCE3TCE|5|I so enjoyed the adventure and perspective of this story. I couldn't wait read each chapter. This story had me transported to the hearts of the characters set in a most horrible time in history. A must read.
B00BMKDTNC|5|Best series of all time. This book is a fitting conclusion. Never wanted it to end and I still don't.
0451196716|5|This is one of those books you read over and over!  You SEE the whole thing in your mind as you take this \\"JOURNEY\\".  Stephen King is the master of the written word and this is a book that should NOT be missed.  Ray Garraty and the other gentlemen are people that are hard to forget!
B00BAXFAJC|5|I managed to get a copy of this book in the UK when it was long-listed for the Man Booker prize. I loved every single page of it. Catton pulls off a literary fiction masterpiece, with elements of a page-turning mystery and character development unparalleled amongst her peers. I can't think of any other recent  writer that has developed 15+ major characters well enough for me to keep track of them without copious notes.
B00003CXDD|5|I mean, this is the movie Willow... does it even need a review? A young Val Kilmer? Get real. If you haven't seen it, you better call someone. Also check out Airborn if you're a fan of this movie. Because you will be a fan of that movie too.
1400052181|5|Another shocking account of the overreaching ability of the medical authorities, with the help of the government!!  Very informative and mind blowing read!!!
B007FEFLTO|5|Riveting!  Enjoy the history along with the story!  Once I start, I don't want to put it down.  Highly recommend this book!
B0076NAVNA|4|Extremely varied album.  Some prog-rock, tending to prog-metal in places, mixed with other tracks that are lighter rock.<br />Drumming is prominent in the mix, as is usual for Mike Portnoy.  Neal Morse seems underutilized.  Everyone is technically brilliant, as you'd expect.  The song-writing is good, although some songs have several parts which don't seem to fit together as fluidly as they might.  The sound is hugely better than the live tracks on You-Tube.  I absolutely love 5 of the tracks and like most of the rest.
B00LSUNGJS|5|It arrived fast and the songs are fantastic!
B00M25DDQE|5|Scarlett is the best! Great movie and great concept for a movie!
B00CWVG1Z8|4|I guess the commercials on TV made it out to be something more like a horror picture or just a lot creepier. Turns out, it is a good old fashioned boy meets girl movie. Well, maybe not quite so old fashioned.
B00NQKW98C|5|Ahh, the old vinyl is the cream for music lovers, it's great to dust off the old record player and listen to great music again. Top Album, the Floyd never disappoints.
0312305060|5|In Michael Cunningham's \\"The Hours\\" we are subjected to the marriage of fiction and historical appreciation at its finest.  I picked this book up because I wanted to read the story before I saw the movie, but I now know that I never want to tarnish the beauty of this experience by watching Hollywood's theatrical version.  Cunningham brilliantly paints a picture of one day in the lives of three different women in three different era's.  First is Virginia Woolf, famous and eccentric writer, plagued by her past and a mind she can't control.  While under the watchful care of her husband, who removes her from London in the 1920's in the hope of saving her from her \\"disease\\", she begins working on her piece, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Then there is the present day Clarissa Vaughan, who creeps into the visions created by Virginia's mental weakness and helps shape the famous literary character, Clarissa Dalloway.  Clarissa Vaughan has even been nicknamed \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\" by her ex-lover and friend, Richard, due to her likeness of the character, which leaves one wondering, \\"Which came first, the chicken or the egg?\\"  Caught up in the middle of this weaving tale is Laura Brown, a 1950's housewife battling her own conflicts and reading Woolf's \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Her gentle existence, though seemingly not outstanding at first, becomes the force that pulls the tendrils of Cunningham's philosophies into order and existence.  All three characters face similar battles; mental and physical illnesses (either of themselves or loved ones), the social barriers and private emotions of homosexuality, the confines of domestic responsibilities and expectations, the preoccupation of death.<br />Cunningham constructs this story so smoothly that it's hard to put down.  When I first heard of his book I assumed it would be somewhat awkward to read; shifting back and forth between decades and characters while trying to somehow find their commonality, but his craft is flawless and the story flows beautifully.  His style is comforting because it blends together new and abstract ideas with familiar detail and images of everyday objects.  <br />I truly believe that any fiction reader will be amazed by this book.  The talent of twisting a relatively preordained pattern of reading into something this fresh and intriguing is so hard to find.  I think a lot of readers will find some of their most private struggles and unnamed thoughts in these women.  This story challenges what you will admit about yourself and brings you a little bit closer to a truth that you're not quite sure is out there.
0307272702|5|I read this and lost 7 lbs in the first month with only minor modifications to my eating habits!
B00499QUK2|5|Being a long time Sherlock Holmes fan I was a little scared to try this show in case they had not done the character justice.  Quite the contrary - it's fabulous!
B0070DQYPU|4|Good Cast, Good Action
B003UESJHE|4|Great movie and I got the blu ray for an excellent price. It doesn't make sense to pay full price but for Black Friday prices it is great.
B0064TVQ5E|5|Enjoying this great version of Mahjong. Lots of levels and different layouts. Easy to see and play.Have fun with it.
B00B7FOQCK|5|Good value and function.  The short cable is great for a single connect to a laptop for all the desk devices, without adding clutter
0439023491|5|Just tell me when book 3 is coming! ARGH! Yes, okay, it was fantastic--just as good as The Hunger Games. But OBVIOUSLY it's not over, and I want to know when I get to read the rest.
B0002XVQNU|5|This is the version that should of been released in the theartres!!  Daredevil the directors cut is one of the best superhero movies ever, much more plot, more characters, and more action, just a great movie!! <br /> <br />
B00J2PCCYQ|5|Very cute!  Even my boys liked it.  It had some jokes for grown-ups and enough of a plot line to keep me interested.
B003B02O0A|5|Exciting and down to earth!
B00ET47USI|5|Thanks...
B000000WI6|5|All i can say is this is Johnny Winter at his peak.some of the best guitar playing ever....by the worlds best blue's guitarist.the song,\\"Life is Hard\\" has Dr John on piano and his solo is spine chilling.Several tracks show Johnny's genius on guitar.every song on this disc is pure Johnny Winter.A must Have.
B0063IH60K|4|Ok, who doesn't like Solitaire? Right?  Easy to use game.  Can change background color, card design, etc.  I enjoy it.  My only complaint is the ads between games.  I understand that they need to make money somehow, but they are still annoying.
B000B8QEZG|5|The thing I admire the most about Madonna is her obvious smarts.  The woman is thoughtful and insightful - a self-made genius.  That being said, this CD is smart and fun dance music.  It's mutilayered: listen once and the ears might focus on the background vocals; listen again and you hear guitar; on another listen the synthesizers might stand out for you.  That is a really fun experience when listening to music.  She demonstrates the ethereality of recent times throughout the album with echoing vocals and keyboards. <br />The thing that prompted me to write this review are the critques of the lyrics from \\"I Love New York.\\"  It's my favorite song on the CD.  Completely intoxicating beats.  Come on people, it's a tribute song, a dance track, and her voice sounds great!  Enjoy the good parts! <br />I was so disappointed by AMERICAN LIFE, particularly after the genius of RAY OF LIGHT (MUSIC was fun too, but not genuis).  She wanted to make a CD that people could have fun with and dance to - she has succeeded with flying colors.
B004SJ3AXI|4|Fun game to play!! Lots of different levels to try out, the graphics are really nice. Easy to play for hours on end!! The only thing i don't like are the adds that some times pop up.
B001IBIHQ4|5|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas because he really liked Band of Brothers. He loved it. Neither of us experienced WWII in person, but the series was realistic and gritty. I think I read reviews by people who said they were there and it wasn't real. My father and uncle felt it was pretty acurate. They also liked Band of Brothers. Bottom line, if you liked Band of Brothers, you will probably like this, too.
B003CLG80A|3|This box set was kind of disappointing for $60. First off I was expecting a nice cardboard box that would house the booklet and CDs, like the nice Rhino handmade releases. Instead it came in a thin paper box with a crease down the spine. The CDs came in this awkward paper booklet that seemed like a waste of paper. Second, the track listing wasn't all that great. I was expecting all the unreleased Raw Power tracks, remastered. Instead you receive this mediocre 8 track CD that includes two songs from the 1997 Iggy Mix of Raw Power, which everyone already owns. I have no idea why they didn't include the classic un-released track, \\"Gimme Some Skin\\".  They should have released both the Iggy and Bowie mixes on the first CD and then maybe the original pre-Bowie mixes with all the unreleased songs from the Raw Power sessions. It's not worth paying an extra $45 for what is basically six un-released songs and a 30 minute documentary, in my opinion. You would be better off buying the Heavy Liquid box set for the same amount of money with about three times the amount of music. This is what they should of re-released or taken note from.
0446585041|5|This book is like a personal chat with Ellen. It is fun and full of joy. I passed it on to my daughter and mother. Our family loves to watch Ellen's TV show daily and I see this book as an Ellen &#34;extension&#34;. It is worth your time and your &#34;dime&#34;. You cannot go wrong with this book.
B000I3UMLQ|1|Absolutely atrocious, with really no value other than the comedy - and I don't mean the &#34;humor&#34; of the film but rather the hilarity of how terrible this film is. Atrocious special effects, bad acting, stilted dialog, and puzzling direction all made this one unbearable. The only thing worth of that one star would be the extraordinary music of Jerry Goldsmith who, even though the film source was terrible, still managed to write a brilliant soundtrack.
B00LDNE3FG|5|The kids like this
B00IEG0JOY|4|so nice to finally have the pictures across all my electroics!
B0006L16N8|5|I've been a Coldplay fan since 2000, and it amazes me how popular they've become in the past 5 years.  Their older work is very broken-down, mostly acoustic.  I was honestly a little disappointed with A Rush of Blood to the Head because it seemed too polished, too overworked.  This album, in some regards, travels in the same direction, but the result with this one is much more hit than miss.<br /><br />The tracks are no longer depressing vocals layered over an acoustic guitar and light drums (although I loved that sound).  X&Y features lush keyboards, more up-front basslines, and even a few drumloops running in the background.  I'm honestly surprised that this approach works so well for Coldplay.<br /><br />The music is beautiful.  You feel like you're staring across an open sky and some sort of musical spectrum.  These songs feel like they have depth to them, but it's not overdone.  There's a feeling of intelligence and profundity, but it isn't snobbish or conceited or arrogant.  You could even call this music humble.  But that's a very abstract way to review a CD.<br /><br />The thing that impresses me about this CD, which is true of all of Coldplay's CDs, is that none of the songs particularly stand out, but the CD doesn't get boring or laborious to listen to.  Coldplay fans should like this CD if they try not to let the new musical elements bother them.  Anyone else who perhaps has heard \\"Speed of Sound\\" on the radio will definitely want to give the rest of this CD a chance.<br /><br />This is still Coldplay, but I'm glad they've taken some steps to keep from regurgitating the same material year after year.  X&Y receives 5 stars from me and my highest regards.
B00005JMSE|5|Though I am a comics reader, I have never paid much attention to Mike Mignola's \\"Hellboy.\\"  All the same, I became intrigued through the high praise that the series has drawn from fandom in general.  It was without any other preconceptions that I saw an advance screening of the movie just last night, courtesy of Big Planet Comics of Bethesda, MD.  I can only say that I was blown away.<br />The visuals are AWESOME, the makeup worthy of an award or two, and the characters instantly likeable.  Best of all, this is not your comic-to-film project that smacks of commercialism and opportunities for merchandising.  Not only does the project have a lot of heart, but you can tell that writer/director Guillermo Del Toro's entire crew put their best into the picture.  Though all of the cast deserves huge kudos in some measure, Ron Perlman as Hellboy is the definitive lead man for the role.  He fits into the character so easily that it's like the Hellboy part was written for him - and Ron must've had a blast playing him, too.  Throw into the mix Mignola's signature creature design, CGI Cthulhu-like monsters, demon-worshipping Nazis, more action and suspense than your usual Summer blockbuster, and all you can do is walk out of the movie theater being hardly able to wait for a sequel or two.  I hope they give the eventual DVD release a 2-disc set treatment, with lots of interviews and \\"making-of\\" featurettes.  Having watched \\"Hellboy,\\"  I can see what the talk has been about and am planning on checking out the other graphic novels in the series.  Believe me, you don't have to be a comics fan to thoroughly enjoy \\"Hellboy\\" - and if you are a Mike Mignola fan, I just bet that this is probably your dream come true.
B00005JKN9|5|Wow!  Martin Scorsese has a cinematic vision in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; and sticks to the storytelling no matter how graphic, how violent, how revealing of the sometimes brash side of human nature.  We like to think of Americana happening somewhere in the Heartland with corn stalks, faded red white and blue from the harshness of the summer sun and winter chill.  What Scorsese shows is that the heart of America may not lie in Nebraska far from civil war battlefields, far from epic wars.  There may be a seedier side born of violence, a country carved out of war, but then not many countries are born of else.  Let me tell you what I mean.<br />&quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; has a deeper message than the simple retelling of a time in the mid 1800's in New York City.  It has elements of the forming of a country in mid-stride.  It has elements of America as the great melting pot or a country fought and &quot;died for&quot; by those feeling worthy of the term natives.  But then the natives led by Bill the Butcher Cutter (played brilliantly by Daniel Day Lewis), aren't really natives on these shores are they?  On the other side of the pitched fight, is Amsterdam Vallon (played less brilliantly but still compelling by Leonardo DiCaprio) as the leader of the immigrant Irish gang.  The battle between the two is broader than a personal vengeance, broader than a family feud despite Amsterdam seeking justice for his father's death at the hands of the butcher.  It is more about a fight for the soul of the country, a pitched battle where both sides suspend reason and turn to violence.  Each feel God is on there side so take the &quot;by any means necessary&quot; approach to prove that might makes right.  There are parallels to the Civil War ongoing but largely out of the picture in the gang war in Five Points slums.  There are even more modern parallels as in the closing scenes we see the New York skyline burning, in the fore frame a graveyard where Amsterdam's father &quot;The Priest&quot; is buried.  The New York skyline is time sequenced as the Brooklyn Bridge remains the constant, the graveyard grows weathered and unkept, the Empire State building appears, and finally in the closing scenes the Twin Towers stand.  There is a parallel to a battle currently raging in the present and New York again seems at the heart of it.<br />&quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; has a feel to it.  There's some Citizen Kane, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and Braveheart all intermingled therein.  It is made to be an epic.  There is good and evil and then there are humans that display all shades of that continuum.  The final battle between the natives and the immigrants is waylaid by the pressure of the Civil War and draft riots.  The final battle becomes clouded and I feel is a misstep in the film.  It leaves for slight disappointment.  In the end &quot;Gangs of New York,&quot; will go down as one of Scorsese's more powerful movies and that says a lot.<br />--MMWe Priest&quot; is buried.

B002SR2PKG|5|Like another reader, I was very young when I read this for the first time. In 6th grade, actually. It didn't scare me, but that was why my dad gave it to me to read - to see if it would.     Whether it be horrific to some (and come on, really? Look at the genre), long, vulgar or any of that I found it to be a fantastic story. And I use that in the actual sense of the word, not in the sense that most people use it.   A horrible evil dwells beneath the city of Derry, Maine - an evil that everyone seems to know about and in some sense they are possessed by It. It feeds on the cities children every thirty years and haunts the memories of the seven main characters of the story, all beginning with that little newspaper boat and poor Georgie. The clown always had that fear element to it because lets face it - for a lot of people clowns are creepy.     Who the characters themselves are seemed a little predictable (kind of) but the book itself was a wonderful read and I'll probably read it over and over again.
6305878323|1|This is a 5-star movie crammed into a 1-star DVD. If you're renting a movie, you only plan on seeing it once... when you buy a movie, you have bought the right to see it whenever you please for as long as you want.  This DVD has FORCED COMMERCIALS! You can not skip them and you are forced to fast-forward through them.  Instead of endearing you to the movies featured in the trailers, you eventually get so mad that the thought of those films makes your blood boil... especially if you already have purchased those films on DVD and you don't need to be coerced into buying them in the first place.<br />There is no excuse for this. Disney should offer refunds and/or replacement discs to those who purchased them on good faith.<br />In addition to the forced commercials, the tech specs are misleading and plain wrong. While the film is widescreen, it is NOT anamorphic as is claimed... this means that while it is in letterbox format, it is not in proper proportion and the images are slightly distorted.<br />Just throwing a movie on a round disk does not a DVD make and this is proof.<br />The movie is fantastic despite these shortcomings... but as the title of this review states - this is a DVD review, not the film. I'd advise waiting until a collector's edition comes out. A collector's edition is likely to contain more features such as interviews with the cast, out-takes and scenes from the Oscars for that year... and (one can only pray) no forced commercials.
B000BCE918|4|Ths replaces the VHS that no longer can be played in our machines. My grandson is very very very happy.
1469984202|5|I don't write many book reviews on Amazon (have I written any??) but I feel moved to do so for WOOL. This is a fantastic read!<br /><br />I don't often pay full price for a book (I often buy used) but at roughly $15, this was well worth the asking price. The paper is heavy weight, the font was a good choice and overall it is a classy package.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the storyline, and there is plenty of room for this story to be continued in sequels or even prequels. The pacing was excellent throughout all 5 segments. And best of all...the CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT! The characters are REALLY well developed, it almost seems like that is the focus of the book more than the story itself. It all comes together for a perfect blend of those three elements.<br /><br />Well done!! I can't wait for more.
B004XUMMFE|5|Nothing better!
B007SGM084|4|The books are well-written and thought-provoking.  It is more than just a love story or mommy porn.  The depth of the characters for such an easy read is great!

630469797X|5|Can i just say that DAWN OF THE DEAD is a true work of art.<BR>The storyline, the action, and everything else works better then i ever expected in a horror film, the atmosphere is astounding and the zombies do excellent in this fine piece of work from and can i say 'a true master' GEORGE A ROMERO. <BR>I would like him and would think thousands of other fans like him to do more 'zombie' flicks but in different situations.<BR>Im not going to spoil this GREAT horror because you must buy it to be believed, your money will be worth spent!

B004SJ3AXI|5|The free seasons of angry bird is a good game and it is free. We only need play and play.
B00BVYNSLC|5|a smart series that is definitely well written and very very dynamic in its content.  I would totally reccomend it.
B004749LO6|5|I LOVE Beyonce! Recieved DVD, picture was great and now I have this to add to my Beyonce' DVD collection! Thank you!
B000054OTY|4|Always a player, risk taker, character !
B0007P3582|4|This cd has alot of great hooks in it. Every one expected a lot of 50 cent with his next album. Nothing is going to follow get rich or dye trying. He came out with some just as great. Buying this cd is worth it.
B005FFW46S|5|You cannot afford to miss the Discworld. There are good books, and there are great books. The Discworld series is quite possibly one of the greatest series ever written. Do yourself a favor... Read them.
B004GYY714|5|I love this app! I like this so much more then I Heart Radio. I like that I can listen to local and world wide stations. I can listen to police scanners (which is fun). I also love that it is so easy to find and listen to my favorite podcasts. I can listen to radio shows from the past when I ever I want. So easy to use on my Kindle Fire.
B000FBJAEG|2|Book started great. That about covers it. The story switched quickly from the current episode and the female protagonist to the male and his story
B00B04NJI0|4|The very flimsy linking concept (each of 26 directors was given a letter of the alphabet to base their death-focused film upon) between these filmmakers and their short Horror films here, is actually enough to string this exceptional collection together. Lots of variety, some animation, some comedy, and lots of stuff to make you think and ogle. My faves? &#34;A is for Apocalypse,&#34; &#34;D is for Dogfight,&#34; &#34;F is for Fart,&#34; &#34;H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion,&#34; &#34;L is for Libido,&#34; &#34;O is for Orgasm,&#34;  and &#34;V is for Vagitus.&#34; Would make a nice double-bill with the stellar Horror shorts collection, &#34;Small Gauge Trauma.&#34;
0375429743|5|this book was a great help when i was preparing for TOEFL iBT back in 2010. my review might be out of date here but i would still recommend the Princeton Review test preparation series if you are preparing for TOEFL or GRE
B004XJRQUQ|5|It's tragic and rewarding.  I'd recommend these books to anyone who loves a good read. I still shed a tear after I've read them a few times.  Great story telling.
B00I8Q77Y0|4|So I had this app for a couple months but I haven't created a review yet. But i had it for a while and after a couple tries in the month that I got it, It was one of the apps that I never use. Its fun but also waste of time. It was better than I thought it would be. But if you like weird games, I recommend this.
B007BFSYMS|5|Lots of good choices that do exactly what it is supposed to do. Can no longer sleep without it! LOVE IT!
B008XG1X18|5|The best resource for ideas, how tos, and other cool and interesting things. I'm addicted. I would recommend to any one.
B001F0N0ZG|5|Great product! It made me smile I liked it so much I think I cried when it arrived!! Simply AWESOME!
B000O8OTNC|5|This is the second of these items I have bought.  I keep one of them in my back pack when hiking.  The sharpener does a great job and is small.
B00992CF6W|1|I hate this game. I have minecraft on my Kindle Fire HD and it is super fun but it keeps making my kindle screen go black and I can't at my kindle for at least 2-3days somebody help me
0385484518|5|I had never heard of Morrie Schwartz, had never seen the Nightline segments, until I heard Mitch Albom talking on a Chicago radio program.  I was captivated, and had to read this book.  I purchased it, and promptly  sat down and read it.  I was not disappointed.  I have passed my copy on to  others, and will continue to do so.<br />Morrie was a wonderful man, and this  is a wonderful book.  Mitch Albom was so lucky to have Morrie in his life.
B00CXQL828|5|I got this record based on the recommendation of That metal show's Eddie Trunk.  He was right,  this album is amazing,  new music performed virtuously. Highly recommended.
B002SJKWZ4|4|I saw a similar item advertized in a magazine at a higher price.  Thought it was a bit too expensive and thought I would try some surfing to see if I could find it cheaper somewhere else, but never got around to it.<br /><br />Then I needed to buy a friend a thank you present and found out they were a huge Harry Potter fan so thought this was the perfect idea.  Found this item on Amazon and decided it was worth a try, and also bought one for myself.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews saying how difficult it was to program, I was a bit nervous.  However, it was a lot easier than I expected.  Some of the commands can be a little more difficult to use - the twisting clockwise and counterclockwise (which I used for volume control) can be a little challenging but does work after a try or two.  All of the others seem to work consistently.<br /><br />Pros: fun case and instructions included, works with many different types of devices, fairly easy to program<br /><br />cons: only 13 different commands (between my tv and cable box, they were quickly used up); reprogramming can be a little difficult so plan ahead on which commands you want to use for each function<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a great product and would recommend it for any blossoming wizards!!
B005URRCUY|5|As always, the Black Keys never fails to disappoint. Even the physical album itself is commendably creative. Dan and Patrick are original musical geniuses and I hope they keep making these albums!
B00W6XM002|4|Fun ,challenging the further into the game you get.
0790729628|2|Blade Runner didn't do much justice for me. There's something missing or wrong with the theatrical and the 1991 DC versions. I will give this movie another chance when it comes out next year. I hope Mr. Scott will give its proper cut.
B003VANOFY|5|Absolutely love these. Worth every penny! The surround 7.1 is Killer.
B00CWY76CC|5|this is the best game ever I can not stop playing I have been in my room for a week
B00DNB9RXO|4|I've only played a little bit of this so far, but I'm really enjoying it. I love the style of these graphics. It's a fun game, and worth a buck or two for sure. Thanks for a great game. Playing on the Kindle Fire HD with no problems.
B00785P2QC|5|It's a real fun game git me hooked right in to it. I like it. Spend my time on break playing it
B00QW8TYWO|5|This game is just like temple run. But this has way more characters to choose from. My favorite is the emo duck an  the zombie. But make sure to update the game fifteen or you miss out on new characters
B00BJA2VFW|3|Nice matching game in a field of hundreds. Crashes my kindle fire sometimes so only three stars. Fix that and you get four.
193700788X|2|SPOILERS.....<br /><br />From the very first pages I felt something was off. The writing felt off; sloppy, strange, inconsistent with Harris' usually witty, hilarious prose. It just felt disjointed and it threw me off. I swear it felt like Harris just wanted to get this series over with and just didn't care enough anymore. What else are we to think when her most cherished characters are left on the back burner, practically non-existent.<br /><br />I'm pretty frustrated, to say the least. I know all books can't end the way I'D like for them to end, but to be THIS predictable is just annoying. I mean come on.... SAM?!! Sam... Really? How convenient that she ends up with a guy who's thoughts she can't really hear 99% of the time. Even though she put him off the entire series, told him time and time again what a great friend he was to her, how much it meant to has his friendship. And then a week after Eric leaves she's in his trailer practically begging for him. I can't even deal with that.<br /><br />Speaking of Mr. Northman.... Siiiiiigh, where to begin. Yes, I am completely biased towards him. I don't think I was delusional enough to think he and Sookie would end up living happily ever after as two beautiful vampires. BUT, I didn't expect him to literally run away like he did. I'm pretty sure Harris must loathe him for otherwise I can't figure out why she would discard him like an old pair of socks.<br /><br />He's only in the book for a few sentences and again, it was frustrating to keep on reading. I kept thinking, no, something is bound to happen, he will reappear and everything will be fine and dandy in the end. This is not the Eric we've come to know for the past however many years. Eric is proud, strong and determined. He cares for and protects what is his. But apparently Sookie just didn't matter enough for him. And vice versa. Sookie never even glanced back. For all her pining, and her aching heart and her tears, I guess it was just all too easy to sweep himunder her rug. And forget he ever existed.<br /><br />The end of the book felt hasty and weird. Yes I figured Claude would make an entrance at some point but it was just DUMB how it all came about. Many of the loose ends were neatly tied up, and by neat I mean convenient. Right down to Sookie's seemingly forgiving nature towards Bill, to Pam becoming the new sheriff after Eric leaves.  I can't really think of anything positive to say about this last book. This is not the Charlaine Harris I fell in love with.
B00BESLHEA|4|If your a Quentin Terantino fan, this one does not dissapoint. Over played, almost comical fight sequences with characters displaying super-human kung-fu abilities. Overly exagerated gore, with kind of a combination of Enter the Dragon and Street Fighter feel. This movie doen't jump around the timeline like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs so it is easier to follow the plot all the way through the film. Grab a bag of popcorn and enjoy!
B00005JKCH|5|my nephew loved it!
B00HDMMISA|5|Love love love this book
B000002UA2|3|As with all Pink Floyd albums of the early 70's, the instrumentals are the best part of Obscured by Clouds. The first two tracks set up a really oppressive mood, while \\"Mudmen\\" exercises emotions in a way simillar to \\"The Great GIg in the Sky.\\" \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" is the best song on the album, though. It creates a really creepy atmosphere, then mixes in a chant done by a New Guinean tribe. While all these instrumental masterpieces are great, the regular songs just don't cut it. \\"Burning Bridges\\" is a boring, less passionate version of \\"Mudmen.\\" \\"Free Four,\\"  and \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" are way too poppy for their own good. \\"Wot's...Um The Deal\\" is a tiring repeat of \\"Brain Damage\\" (which was already written when the Floyd recorded this, while \\"Stay\\" is a sad attempt by Rick Wright to write another great emotional song like \\"Summer '68\\" The only song with lyrics worth listening to is \\"Childhood's End,\\" but \\"The Narrow Way\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" are still far superior Gilmour efforts. I wouldn't reccomend that new Floyd fans eager to hear early songs that weren't on Echoes buy this. Instead, get More, Ummagumma, or Atom Heart Mother.
B008JGSM6G|5|it was a great game and i think i would play it again and again. i passed all levels quickly and with ease some of them almost stumped me but i just went back to them again another time.
B006GLLXXK|5|Now I understand why everyone fell in love with the show
B001L5SXQG|2|Being a big fan of Bruce it is hard to listen again to such an awfully produced album. The sound is boxy, the backing vocals arrangements are lacking; what a waste of the great music the E-Street Band can produce. The songs will certainly sound better live because they are so bad on the record.  The songs writing is better compared to the last effort (Magic) but well below par compared to the Rising or Bruce's earlier effort.  Last but not least, the new tour is priced sky high with some tickets 20% more expensive compared to last year in Europe. Bruce had a great and long career thanks also to his commitment and respect for his fans; releasing one un-inspired album every year with an expensive tour to follow in big stadiums might be good for Sony but not for fans.
B00J4A27B2|5|fantastic album.
B009CPJHY4|5|Just a wonderful  feel good movie.  There is life after 70!  The cast is magnificent, but then anything with Judy Dench has got to be great
B006LSZECO|5|Real page turner! Couldn't put it down and can't wait to see the movie excellent writing
B00KCOMBJC|5|It's Beyonce!
B000I9VZJ8|5|Love the movie! Took about 45 min. longer because of problems with the download. :(
B009TGWYGY|5|Inspirational movie, this movie should be shown in high schools
B0091W7MP4|4|Very good movie. Just wish it didn't have the cussing in it. Other than that we thought it was a good movie.
B008WCP2KG|1|No movie is more awful than this one, there is so much bad about this movie I don't even know where to start. The acting, absolutely horrible. The only thing worse than the script is the directing. There was absolutely nothing good about this movie and am now no longer a fan of any of the guys in it. I am so mad I wasted money on this.
B00005JLO2|3|\\"The Four Feathers\\" is a gloriously photographed, well-acted historical epic. What nearly undoes it is the source material - a 1902 novel by A.E.W. Mason, which has been filmed at least four times before. There were silent versions made in 1915, 1922 and 1929, as well as a highly regarded talking version in 1939. Its story of a pacifist who is cast out of British society because he refuses to go to war is still compelling, but the idea that British colonialism and the warfare it produced was somehow noble and glorious is not. <br />Harry Faversham [Heath Ledger] is a young member of an elite branch of the British Army. His good friends are the best and the brightest in the regiment. He is engaged to the smart, beautiful Ethne [Kate Hudson]. His life seems perfect until he and his friends learn that their regiment is to be sent to the Sudan to help quell a native rebellion. Harry suddenly realizes he doesn't want to go to war. His whole life has been dictated by his military family. He impulsively quits the army. Ethne and three of his friends send him white feathers, which are symbols of what they perceive to be his cowardice. He is filled with guilt, not because he left the army, but because he abandoned his friends. A few weeks later, he secretly journeys to the Sudan to find them. It's a dangerous trip, and by the time he reaches them, he can not bring himself to reveal himself. Instead, he disguises himself as an Arab and aids them in secret.<br />This is obviously an expensive movie. It contains massive battles scenes and lavish sets. For the visuals alone, it is worth seeing. Ledger gives a first rate performance as Faversham, as does Wes Bentley as his best friend, Lt. Jack Durrance. The script, however, can't help but show us people in places they shouldn't be doing things they shouldn't do. [Westerners prior to WW II didn't view it this way.] We still have great empathy for Faversham as regards his feelings of loyalty to his friends, but it's hard to feel much sympathy for the friends themselves, due to their blind obedience to the dubious ideals of the British Empire. In the end, \\"The Four Feathers\\" is itself outdated.
B00AEJM6H2|5|I am on my second time through. It is great! I really like the difficulty levels, the variety of configurations, the types of illustrations used and even the music. It is great!
B00JQHON74|4|Yes ... for Yes!
B0041KKYDI|5|I can't remember the last time I had such a visceral and emotional reaction to a movie...and no, it didn't have anything to do with him cutting off his arm!  This film was powerful on a cerebral, not graphic level.  Sure, the blood is there, but nothing more than you would see on network primetime (think CSI).  I'm actually surprised it garnered an \\"R\\" rating.  However, what makes this film better than great is the realization Ralston comes to.  In his darkest hour he accepts that he is not perfect and, understanding his own imperfections, moves forward with a survival instinct that would cause many others to crumble.  I cannot recommend this film highly enough!  For the true adventurer it does not make you afraid of the wild, it makes you want to go out and challenge yourself even further!
B004J4WLB4|5|This is a very touching story of a girl who loving and being loved doesn't exactly come easy to. Highly recommended.
B003ZSJ212|1|Lucas's incessant fiddling with these films have utterly neutered their impact, turning them from the greatest sci-fi saga ever made into a laughable pastiche of what they once were.  Avoid.
B009UX2YAC|5|This is very good cuz you you get coins every round and it shows you the first round how to do it but in real life if you did this you would get arrested
B008BU75IQ|3|the book is just ok not excellent or great. probably worth reading, but not great and do not rush to get it.
B00464F19Q|5|Great movie.
B008QOH1NG|4|I am a huge Stryper fan, and can accurately assess the band's performance.  This is a good performance.  Missing some of the little things, but nothing large enough to ruin the show.  If you are a die hard fan, than don't hesitate adding this to your collection.  If you are just getting into Stryper, than I would suggest that you order the [[ASIN:B000MV8ZZ4 Stryper: Greatest Hits - Live in Puerto Rico]].  That is a five star show, this one is a four star show.
B00B2V66VS|5|hard and challenging but this is good! Love playing it and get very close at times so I know its achievable
B006LSZECO|4|Kept me interested.  However would of liked it more if the language was a little less vulgar. Would not recommend it to my granddaughters.
B00004XONN|5|This is definitely the best Radiohead's album not taking into account Amnesiac.  It is full of real emotions and unexplainable sadness.  The more you know, the more grief you experience.  Their music is evolving all the time.  You cannot sit and hope that a next album will be similar to a previous one.  In my opinion that is the case with most people who are disappointed with Kid A.  But at the same time, this is what differs Radiohead from others and makes them one of the best groups I've ever heard and the only one that STILL creates music.
B0070Y46UY|5|This is a great book very exciting with a great ending!! I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars although the beginning of the book is a little hard to follow.  This book is good enough that I would read it again! Overall it is a marvellous book and I suggest YOU read it!!!
B0055V6EZE|4|I am a Hugh Laurie fan (Dr. House); but, his CD was an amazing surprise.  I heard him on one of the late shows a few years ago with his &#34;garage band&#34; and was impressed with the talent.  So when I had the opportunity to order the CD, I did so immediately.<br /><br />Just so you know, I am not a music expert, but enjoy all types.  This CD was kind of like a quick trip to New Orleans.<br /><br />I definitely look forward to his next release.
B000FC10HA|5|Reading this today feels like it might not be 100% true. I did still really enjoy every part of it. It made me think of different products today at my own business and others.<br /><br />Sometimes people buy &#34;ideas for your next product&#34; type books but this is a good way to flush out some of them.
B007FG9LIE|5|It was exciting and disturbing,

B0007GAEW6|5|I thought it was going to be impossible to top \\"De-Loused In the Comatorium\\", but somehow, The Mars Volta managed to do it. If you enjoyed either Tremulant EP, or De-loused In the Comatorium, you'll love this album. The album takes you on a musical journey. No other band around is anything like this band. The Mars Volta is simply amazing, and I hope they continue to make great albums, such as This one. My email is ATDIhendrix@gmail.com and I am boomstick on Transient Jet lag.
B0062NAX1U|5|Delivery was fast as promised, in great condition (like new), played fine, and the movie is awesome.  Every father and family member should see this movie.

B0085Z8F4A|5|I really like this movie. I'm not really familiar with the Alien series, but I know this is a prequel. I thought it was a good story line and fantastic special effects--the 3D especially. The movie was epic. I admit, there were a few things I had a few quarrels with it, such as some of the things the supposed scientists said or did--but nothing really extreme. Overall, the film had a good since of reality, and that combined with the effect is what made it epic.<br />I highly recommend!
B009ZQC7MY|5|Awesome storyline, character development is outstanding, if you love period pieces you will love Downton Abbey<br />Looking forward to season 4
B00A6CCF0K|3|I am a big Stephen King reader and I found it hard to stay interested in this book. Going to read the shining again and give doctor sleep another shot sometime in the near future.
B007SGM084|5|Entertaining set of books. Have problems putting it down when I start reading it though. Sometimes til 3 a.m.
B006ON41FC|5|This game is soo fun!!!  I loved it!!!!! The game is solo fun and its so cool to be able to buy outfits for your sugar glider!
0767903862|5|I read this book prior to first traveling to Australia a few years ago and ended up learning more about the country's history and people, etc than even my boyfriend knew..... and he was Australian! Now, after having lived in Australia for several years, I still recommend this book to friends and family who are planning to visit because I think Bryson does an excellent job of capturing all that is unique and special about Australia. A must read.
B007OVBTSK|4|I gave this away to someone else

B00VFTCGES|1|Purchased and then streaming wouldn't work.  Have spent 30 minutes searching the amazon site to find out how I can email someone about this order, but can find nothing.  So frustrating!
B006O5YIMQ|5|one of the best movies I've ever watched
0205313426|5|About twenty years ago I attended a report writing course for technical people and was given a copy of \\"The Elements of Style\\" as a guide to writing technical reports for non technical people. Over the years it has proved invaluable and when I found it was available on Amazon.com I purchased five copies, a new one for myself, one for each of my sons as they enter into their professional careers and a spare one that I will give to some deserving person when the opportunity arises.
B00004THAY|5|Clapton and King. Sublime yet visceral blues are what you expect and you'd not be wrong with this album. Clapton's mastery of the guitar and BB's quintessential blues voice create a resounding exclamation of what blues is at its source. I can't imagine a better living duo to record together and the music does not disappoint, even considering the expectations one has of the artists. Great talent and a great album.
B00BMCAM6M|5|Love the genres and the ability to customize the listening experience! So glad there is a Kindle app for this!
B0063IH60K|5|I used to play this on an ipad. so happy to see it on kindle. try their freecell too. gameplay is fluid and touch works well.
B004LOMB2Q|5|Love it. Love it. Love it. Definitely my fav, 2nd only to my Bible app and I haven't even tapped its full potential.
B008K9SG9K|5|I'd been hearing their music on the radio and other mediums and never knew it was them until a month or so ago.  Every song on the album is awesome!  It's so great when that happens.  I highly recommend this group and their music.
B005D9MUWY|4|Word prediction is nice. I had a 13% efficiency boost in the SwiftKey Statistics. Hopefully that goes up now after upgrading to X.<br /><br />- The ability to have arrow keys is GODLY for phones without a trackball. Thanks for this! Why don't more keyboards do this?<br /><br />- Reason for 4 stars: I wish there was a way to have more suggestions. 3 is often too little. An option to use 4 or 5 would be great, especially for those of us with large-screened phones (4.3\\"+). (And before people complain, notice I said an *OPTION*, as in an optional choice in the settings menu.)<br /><br />- Also I wish there was a way to quickly capitalize words like Swype does. Select the word, press Shift, and it gives you the choice of word/Word/WORD. This would be convenient in many cases.

B004J09ONG|4|Wonderful fun movie to watch, kinda like watching your children mature and go off to have their own famly and hope you did the best for them possible.
B0043KK4N6|5|If you love Christina Aguilera, you need this CD in your collection. It showcases the amazing range of her vocals, from the kittenish 1920's-breathy-sexy &#34;But I Am A Good Girl&#34; to the belting &#34;Tough Lover&#34; to the ballad &#34;Bound to You&#34;. The soundtrack is overall just as fun as the movie.<br /><br />Cher -- not so much; her &#34;Welcome to Burlesque&#34; is catchy and fits with the rest of the soundtrack, but the other song &#34;You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me&#34; was like a pointless dagger in the otherwise good pace of both the film and the soundtrack.
B005ZMV2EQ|5|BEST MOVIE EVER!!!
B00E7PQVHK|5|Great Game.  I have played all the Heroes titles over the years and despite the wonky controls, this is an excellent little game.
B0050DIWFC|5|A captivating tale of a father torn between protecting his child, solving a crime, and how the family deals with the entire process, a must read!

B009TGVUPA|3|good monster movie
B00H4LL9JE|2|Series seems to have lost it punch. The whole story seems to be draging now. Whould have been good to have a closure now.
B00KA7JIII|5|Excellent all around game.  Great graphics and great game play.  The main character is a tad bit freaky and it keeps you evolved. I don't often write app reviews but I had to share how great this game was.
B00IG2DOKM|5|This is the best farming &amp; town game I've found yet. Lots of options, great speed of activities &amp; production so far.
B007J4T2G8|3|Not what I expected. Just a romance novel to me. I was hoping for a little more depth and, stylistically, it just wasn't for me.
B000ZLFALI|5|Awesome adaptation of the Beatles music. This film has a raw feeling that could go anywhere. Terrific talented new actors. Definately some tremendous performances with great direction. A winner for me.
B00JZK0QNM|4|Not much challenge  yet but pretty flashy.
0140177396|5|After reading this novel for an English class, I ended up loving it! John Steinbeck is an amazing writer and conveyed how people felt about the mentally handicapped during the Great Depression. His writing style was wonderfully filled with figurative language. As for the themes in the novel, It greatly focuses on things like survival of the fittest (as talked about with the mentally handicapped), friendship (between George and Lennie), and sacrifice (George constantly made sacrifices for Lennie, such as moving jobs whenever he go them fired.) In conclusion, I loved this book and look forward to reading more of Steinbeck's novels in the future and recommending them to my friends and family.
B004H4XDBI|5|Saw the movie, read the books. Can't wait for the 2nd movie. Could'nt put it down. Stayed up all night until I finished it. Totally worth it.
031606792X|5|In her fourth book Stephanie Meyer continues to bring her writing  skills to higher levels using a rich variety of similes. She is a master  of making language flow.  Each of her books captivates the reader   with her gift for language and how she handles the characters emotions.  She's a gifted writer.  I've even read her adult book \\"The Host\\" and she carries her use of  language to a high level it it as well.
B001974DG0|5|Lots of fun, although disturbing at times, but a good ride.  The evil in this book is truly evil, which is why it's so disturbing next to the dog, who Dean captures unbelievable well.  A great good vs. evil book, very funny at times with the dog antics, but scary as well.  I really enjoyed it.
B004GYY714|5|Works well on my Kindle.
B0019N8P2W|5|The item arrived on time and was the perfect gift. I was updated all along the way of the pending arrival time and was pleased with the process.
B00E8KLWB4|4|I just got this game today and I'm addicted. If you like I spy type games and puzzles you'll like this too.
B00993G41S|5|A great satire, spoof, farce and romance. Really John Cleese's baby and he gets his chance at leading man. Keep in mind Cleese has done BBC Shakespeare so like the rest of the Pythons he's just too damned talented. In concert with Michael Palin, Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, Tom Georgeson, Geoffrey Palmer, Maria Aitken and a cameo by Stephen Fry Cleese manages to be charming and witty and rebels against being an Englishman. Meanwhile there's a robbery, murder, sex, philosophy, and the occasional chip. And the middle bit, I forget.<br />A tidy little flick.
067443000X|5|exceñemt book. Thanks
B00005NNMJ|5|Many metal fans feel that Accept hit their creative apex with `Balls to the Wall' and while I find the album to be an outstanding example of the heaviest side of commercial metal I feel it must take a backseat to `Restless & Wild' due to the latter record's decidedly less commercial sound. Not that these albums are light years different; both were self-produced but `Balls' has a crisper production (you can tell the band had some more ducats to spend on this one courtesy of their last).  The LP was without a doubt the band's biggest American success when it was released in early 1984, a month or so after the late '83 European debut and the title track instantly made the band a known commodity in the States. I first heard it a Van Halen concert during the break between opener and headliner and man was that song loud on the arena's PA! I thought who the heck are these guys? Many fans probably thought a harsher sounding Judas Priest due no doubt to Udo's voice and look and the band did bring the inevitable comparisons but I think Accept's music of this period was better than Priest's in terms of what each contributed to its own legacy (Priest had begun to sink into a creative slumber). \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"Love Child\\", \\"Fight It Back\\" and \\"Guardian of the Night\\" are some of my other favorites only \\"Winterdreams\\" being a song that I don't play much. Accept were on a creative roll here and if only the sales would have been complementary. Alas Accept deserves more than just a footnote in metal history but for those of you who have their catalog from the years 1981-1985, then you already know how great this band was...but they should've been much bigger...
B00SI7GCJK|5|Top ten movies for me
B003P2WO5E|5|Loved it. Best Epic Fantasy novel I have ever read.
B000BTC5LW|4|When I purchased this DVD I had high hopes.  I thought the concert was great especially the lasers, special effects, and screen films. The biggest highlight for me though was when they performed \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" in its entirety.    However I felt some of the bonus material was unnecessary such as the footage from their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which I thought was bland. I also didn't care for Billy Corgan's speech. I also didn't like the footage from \\"Bootlegging The Bootleggers\\".  It was terrible!     Despite these setbacks the rest of the DVD was incredible.  Even without the extras this still would have been a great DVD. Wish Roger was there.
B004MC8CA2|5|This is the best Bible app that I ever had the pleasure of using. I would recommend everyone try it out. The plans are created to do daily and there is no way you won't grow spiritually if doing them regularly. If I could give it a ten star I would.
B00005ASHM|5|Stating that this is the greatest album of all time will puzzle some people who then expect to hear the fireworks of the end of &quot;A day in the life&quot; on Sgt. Pepper or some other pyrotechnics which are usually associated with &quot;great&quot; albums. This album is great in the sense that it is the best work of one of our greatest songwriters and producers, Brian Wilson. It is great in the sense that it can match the best songwriting of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, Jimmy Webb, Burt Bacharach, Holland-Dozier-Holland. It is great in the sense that its production is the product of Wilson's very careful and tasteful musical sensibility. It is great in the sense that it is so deeply heartfelt and tender that its humanity makes it universal. Looking for an album that will blow your mind on first listening and then grow old very quickly after the cheap effects wear off their novelty? Don't buy this one. If, on the other hand, you are looking for an album which never ages and should be packed for your entire journey through life along with some favorite photographs and books, this is the one to bring. I can't imagine ever growing tired of this album. I bring it out to listen to every few months and expect to do the same when I am in my 70's. A wonderful album.
B0094LZY2A|5|Classic...Robin Williams at his best!
B00G5G7K7O|5|Hard to believe disney actually came up with a classic again, and, though the plot is weak, and leaves some to be desired, the music's grand, and this is a repeat viewer :)
B00F8L2VO4|4|Fun little tool. Pictures are great. Can go over several times  not only improves memory; also improves accent.  Funny how some words remind me of events
B0063IH60K|5|wow. I love this game I wanted to try and now I'm awesome at it. 5stars all the way great game.
B002MQYOFW|5|This is a fantastic book. The best of the series. Original storyline and real characters with depth. This story really made me feel like I was right there the book with the characters.
B00CX1TSSO|5|This is a movie that both children and adults will enjoy. My husband and I are \\"seniors\\" and loved the creativity of the giant's, the storyline, and the characters. Hey, you have the villain, the heros, a princess in distress and giants who would love to eat all of them. What more could you ask for? The special effects weren't as hokey as I thought they would be. They were fantastic! Great twist on Jack and the Bean Stalk! What once was old, is made new in a good way!
B004SEUJBE|5|Had not seen it since at the theatre. As a native Chicagoan, it again made me smile throughout most all of this sensational movie. Expretly cast and scored....Loved it !!!!
B000067CPX|4|True, all bands need to evolve, and every once in a while they need to come out with an album that shows a different direction and expand their musical canvas. By The Way is the second album that the Peppers have done that has went in a direction far away from the fast paced rock and high octane funk (the first was 1995' One Hot Minute) which was a staple with their other albums.  <br /> <br />For pedestrian fans of RHCP, By The Way, is very welcoming. For hardcore fans like me, By The Way is a hit or miss. You either like it or you don't. I like it, for that Anthony Kiedis's vocals are better than ever and it shows the real talent of the bands chemistry. By The Way is almost refreshing in a way with relaxing tracks such as \\"The Zephyr Song\\", \\"Venice Queen\\", and \\"I Could Die For You\\". Classic Chili Peppers shows through the Californication-sounding \\"By The Way\\", the anti-drug anthem \\"Can't Stop\\", the Freaky-Styley funk-meets-ska \\"On Mercury\\", the heavily funky bass lines of \\"Throw Away Your Television\\", and the slap bass off of \\"Minor Thing\\".  <br /> <br />\\"Don't Forget Me\\", \\"This Is The Place\\", \\"Midnight\\", \\"Tear\\", \\"Universally Speaking\\", \\"Cabron\\", \\"Warm Tape\\", and \\"Dosed\\"  are probably the most interesting tracks on the album. If you really think about it, it slightly goes back to the experimental vision they had on One Hot Minute. Though it worked better on By The Way, the violins on \\"Midnight\\" sort of kill the song at the begnning (though it recovers with an excellent chorus), \\"Universally Speaking\\" dragged too much (even though it is actually beautiful), and the Latin-flavored \\"Cabron\\" was too iffy on the vocals. \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is the best song on the album and \\"Warm Tape\\" is the worst, it's almost like \\"Porcelain\\" dragged out way too much. <br /> <br />The instruments and the vocals are of high quality, the band actually never sounded better and more cohesive, though at times Chad Smith is almost non-existant. But as many people know Anthony and John Frusciante did steal the show, which kinda made Flea seem dead at times. But that's just me being of the nitpicking nature. The harmonic and the melodical styles they display on here makes this a pretty good album. <br /> <br />However, would I want more albums by the Peppers like this in the future? God no.
B0024FAR5M|5|I had heard about SOA at work, from my wife's work friends, and just on the internet, but since I don't find motorcycle gangs ONE BIT interesting, I figured this show would be a flop for me. I couldn't have been more wrong!  After &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; I never thought I'd be able to find a show that has the grit, raw emotion, peak into the world of crime, dark humor, and enigmatic addictive adrenaline that BB had again. Impossible? Sons of Anarchy has insanely good character development, it beautifully shows the best intentions turned to mush, the futility of justifying crime as a legitimate lifestyle and inevitable means to an end, and it digs deep into how hard it is to change people. Jaxs wants to live up to his dad's legacy, fulfill his dream, but as he gets deeper into this criminal world, he finds more and more obstacles and barriers. The show has characters that you CARE ABOUT, a lot of humorous (always dark variety!) moments and anecdotes about life, and I especially love how it shows how criminals are often a product of a reaction to the absurdity and hypocrisy of law enforcement and 'legal' corruption.  You'll find yourself loathing the ATF more than SAMCRO or the Myans or Niners in no time! The show Is a rich tapestry of interwoven relationships, mistakes, bad memories, unfulfilled dreams, dark secrets, and dedicated friendships. I can't say enough about the richness of this show, the addictive quality of it, and the genius of Kurt Sutter, the show's creator. It is pure brilliance and the best show on TV at this time. Watch it! If you had a curious desire to watch &#34;Breaking Bad,&#34; but couldn't get past the meth cook underbelly idea but watched it anyway and found it to be the ultimate show, you'll feel the same way about SOA after you get past the seedy dark world of motorcycle gangs. In no time terms like &#34;Redwood Originals, Patch-overs, going nomad, going to &#34;church,&#34; wearing a cut, Old-lady, one-percenter, and sweetbutt will becomestandard parts of your lexicon! Bon appetite! This show rocks.
B009X01FJS|2|I had a similar cover for my 7\\" Kindle Fire, and loved it. I expected this one to be like it for my 8.9\\" new Kindle Fire HD. It isn't. The back cover has a piece that is attached to the plastic hard cover that has a seam connecting the 2 pieces. No matter what you do, if you don't keep the item flat, the Kindle will flap around. I read in bed lots of times, and my head is lower than the Kindle. and I use the handy holder on the back of the front cover. That was fine on my old 7\\" cover, but this new one is made differently, and the heavier part of the cover with the Kindle attached just flaps open. They may say that it's due to the revolveable feature, but I think, for what they charge for it, it could have been done differently, or put some hook and loop on the back to keep it from flapping open when I'm laying on my back. I'm thinking of sending it back. There are many cheaper covers that will do as well.
B001NLKT60|5|What is left to say? This was the best series I have read in years. I fought reading these books because sometimes when books get so much hype I find I get let down. Not so with these books.
B00008H2LB|1|Linkin park was never my favorite band and will never been.  There cd \\"Meteora\\" kick off very nice with glass shattering at the end after the 14 sec kickoff.  Then \\"breaking the habit\\" start and it sound really nice.  honestly i love this cd when i burrow it from my friend and copy it for myself.  But in about two day, i was quickly tire of this cd.  I would review it track by track but this album doesn't deserve my review.  Do yourselve all a favor and don't buy this album! Period!
B004GUSG4M|4|I loved this book, the concept, the writing style, the twists....Everything.  Except the end.  I am dying to know what happens the next day!  Sequel, please!
0345803485|1|I wanted to read the book again before the movie came out.  Just curious how they could put all that on the sreen.
B00KBNRZ9K|5|The blu ray surround sound is amazing. The rest of the package is a bonus.
0804161380|5|I chose this rating because this set was a Christmas gift and my son was so thrilled to receive it. The quality of the books are exceptional.  I would recommend the purchase of this set to anyone who is a fan of Zelda's games.

B0001CNRBG|5|My favorite movie of all time .... It's a comical love story and leaves you with a warm feeling .... the only movie that I have ever watched multiple times...
B0010YSD7M|4|Ark of Truth is a must see for fans of the series. It concludes the Ori battle and yet ends with SG-1 starting another mission. Something SG-1 has not had time to do for a couple years. Let's face it most of us have missed Jack and the exploring they use to do. The bulk of the movie is finding a weapon to destroy the Ori, but it turns out it is not where they first thought and when they find it, it doesn't do what they originally thought either. However they are victorious and there are changes of loyalty from a place you might not expect. Overall I was not at all disappointed, but I must admit the scene with Teal'c walking across a desert after being shot by a Ori weapon was a bit much.<br /><br />The wife and I were a bit disappointed that Richard Dean Anderson didn't even put in a cameo appearance. Excellent production values as always, they won't seem better as the TV series was so good that we were all spoiled by them. The DVD includes plenty of extras including a prelude you can play previous to watching the movie. The prelude is snapshot segments from several episodes from the last two seasons and that lead up to the final battle. I bought a copy because I loved the series and it wouldn't be complete without this movie. They made it clear another movie is in the works. Let us hope there will be more exploration and singular episodic adventures for future movies. Great quality picture and sound and good replayability.
B0052VUNHC|5|In honor of Travis' birthday and in anticipation of the next book I had to read...for the third time.  Each time gets better and better. I'm sure I will revisit these two again and again.
0399161287|5|Gave this as a gift to my husband for Christmas, he says the book is well written, he is enjoying it!
B0058VW36U|5|A perfect little game well executed. The art is clever. The gameplay is simple yet still full of nuance and there is some mental agility required to play. Overall, great combination. This is the type of game I WANT my kids to play . . . but they'll have to wait their turn.
B005ORVN1Y|3|Having finally digested all the discs I ask the following question about the Signals discs.You have three versions of Signals; the CD version, another version of the CD but on DVD and then the 5.1 mix.Now whilst the mixes on the two 'normal' versions are good, I expected more. The best versions I've ever heard of songs from Signals were the three twelve inch singles; New World Man, Subdivisions and Countdown and I'm not sure why I have two stereo mixes which are disappointing.  Then there is the 5.1 mix which is totally different, different vocal takes, different guitar tracks,and can someone please tell me what is going on in the middle of The Weapon where the guitar drops out then comes back out of time.Surely  we could have got a mix of the CD enhanced like the awesome version of The Analog Kid on the 5.1 version.  Grace Under Pressure was a nice surprise as I had it on vinyl 20 years ago, and it has aged well.Initially after Signals I didn't like its dark tone.  Power Windows is better with more bottom end and less distortion on Alex's chorus/flanged guitar, and the keyboard taken back a bit.It has dated well  I hated Hold Your Fire when it first came out and nothing endears me to it now.It sounds dated with that awful electric piano and cheesy synth effects along with Alex's guitar that sounds really trebly and thin at times.  Fortunately A Show of Hands sounds better and I am in the audience at the Birmingham concert.Ironically the Hold Your Fire songs sound miles better live.

B002ZFQD04|5|This is an excellent DVD.  Received it within 2 days from Amazon.  I love Madonna and saw her in concert once.  I couldn't afford seats close enough to really see her so this DVD of her tour was wonderful!  She performed her new music as well as some of her old.  She is just awesome and this DVD won't disappoint the avid Madonna fan.
B008JFUPK8|1|I am not usually critical of movies or TV shows. Some people don't understand what a movie is meant to be, and that is why they rate it badly. While I might not like a specific movie or genre, I understand that all movies have an emotional reaction that they try to elicit from the audience. Sometimes a movie is a parody, an action/drama, comedic in nature with some action, and my favorite of  all epic. That being said Superman is the worst movie I have viewed so far this year, (2013). There was no clear emotion that it elicited in me. The movie was hyped up so much that I figured it would have to be a little bit of a let down. Little did I know that it would be so much more then that.<br /><br />I enjoyed the beginning of the movie, but then after that it all went downhill. There was far to much CGI. This wouldn't be such a big deal if it looked good, but it didn't. Blockiness destroyed all the fast scenes and didn't even allow me to enjoy the classic imagery of superman flying. I don't mind the plot not being lock step with the previously published comics and movies, but don't change just for the sake of change. If your going to change make it better.<br /><br />The casting of the movie was generally good, except for Louis Lane. I don't know if it was Amy Adams or just the character she played, because she was the weakest link. I don't understand why the Kryptonians took her on to their vessel. They were going to use her to get Clark, but he turned himself in. So why did they need her? They obviously didn't, but someone needed to let Jor-El's program loose on the alien ship so it was forced like so many other parts of the script. Also some how and some way Louis always seemed to find Clark no matter where he was. Even after that huge battle between Clark and Zod that leveled the entire city, 10 seconds later she magically ran up out of nowhere. The emotional scenes all seemed forced and contrived from Clark letting his father die, to the corny kiss between Clark and Louis right before the fight with Zod which I saw coming from a mile away.<br /><br />The corniest part of the movie was when the army general said what the F when superman destroyed the drone. I know the movie is PG-13, but come on. Just don't use it then. I left the theater at that point even though the movie was already almost over. I am embarrassed for Christopher Nolan.

Hopefully he will take over directorial duties for the sequel.d Louis right before the fight with Zod which I saw coming from a mile away.<br /><br />The corniest part of the movie was when the army general said what the F when superman destroyed the drone. I know the movie is PG-13, but come on. Just don't use it then. I left the theater at that point even though the movie was already almost over. I am embarrassed for Christopher Nolan.

B006P4FBUE|5|This will help me create melodies while on the run. My only dislike is that I haven't figured out how to change the tempo of the beats. Could just be that I just got it and haven't quite monkeyed around with it enough yet. If no tempo option, devs please add that. Would make it 10 stars. Thanks?

B00K7C17QW|1|The concept of this game is fun.  BUT...you can only play for about 15 minutes before your energy runs out and they want you to spend actual money to play the game!  I can't stand games that claim to be free then charge ridiculous amounts of money to continue playing.  The icing on the cake is this game hasn't loaded for over 2 weeks. There is something major wrong with it and the gamemakers haven't bothered to patch it yet, glad I never wasted and money on this one.
B0009UC810|5|This movie is a definate classic.  How can you go wrong with classic John Belushi, Dan Akyroyd in the SNL roles with Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, James Brown and others singing soul classics?  Look for cameos with Joe Walsh, Chaka Khan, Carrie Fisher, John Candy, John Landis (who directed), Paul Rubins and Steven Spielberg.  I love, love, love, love this movie.
B000062YAZ|5|The only problem with Reign in Blood is that it totally blows anything Metallica has done out of the water.  Just because you can't admit that Reign in Blood leaves Kill 'em All in the dust doesn't mean that Slayer sucks.  So get over yourselves.  At least Slayer didn't sell out to be a bunch of whiny coporate tools.
B005LAIIJY|5|Terrific film - very well acted - a basic revenge story that is well done.  Sure the violence is a little overdone - but that's what makes it fun! Christoph Waltz is amazing in this movie.
B00915G6R6|5|Great quality.
B002QE3CTY|4|What can I say? I like young adult dystopian novels. This book was very exciting and mysterious. I was very engaged, and it didn't take me long to read it at all. The ending made me want to bang my head on the wall, and of course, I bought the second one so I could read it right away. I watched the movie, which was a little disappointing. I don't know why they felt the need to make so many changes. At any rate, it was a good book, and I highly recommend it.
0307594165|4|In \\"Home\\", we have the story of Frank Money, a bitter, damaged veteran of, most recently, the Korean Conflict, and in a broader sense the American racial conflict. Two years home from the war, he's a drifter with one guiding principle: he never intends to return to his home town of Lotus, GA. His most recent dread stems from the fact that he alone of a trio of near lifelong friends has returned from war, but that is only the top layer of his distaste for a town that was defined in childhood, for him, as a place of neglect, humiliation, and loss. It is only when he receives a letter begging him to once again save his beloved younger sister that he finds the courage (perhaps born of desperation) to revisit his past.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is a slim book, less than 150 pages, but there is a wealth of wisdom encapsulated in its pages. There are lessons about dignity, courage, regret, loss, but most importantly about defining one's own life. For being such a short book, Ms. Morrison has done an admirable job of creating fully-fleshed characters in Frank and Cee, his sister; I always admire someone who can tell a succinct, yet still complete, story. We learn things about Frank and Cee in bits and pieces, much of it non-linear in time, which feels like getting to know a flesh and blood person; who, after all, reveals to us their life and soul starting with their birth and moving in orderly progression to the current day?<br /><br />The title of the story comes from a cherished theme, I think: home is where and what you make it. There is much talk of homes and houses in this story, from the ramshackle house in Texas that the Moneys flee when Frank is only four years old, to the home his family shares for a few years with their silent grandfather and cruel step-grandmother, to the apartments they later inhabit; we even get a look at the desire to own her own home Frank's briefly mentioned girlfriend has, and how the effect of his indifference to her desire has upon her and their relationship. The dimensions of rooms are detailed, the conditions of houses as a reflection of their owners--it's really marvelous how these details become almost another character in themselves.<br /><br />An interesting plot device occurs when Frank occasionally speaks for himself, first person narrative in the midst of a mainly third person narrative; Sometimes he agrees with the story teller, sometimes he's flashing out a point, occasionally he contradicts her entirely. It's a lesson in the unreliable first person narrator (as Frank also ultimately contradicts himself in a major plot point), but it's also a lovely counterpoint to the sometimes heavy structure of the main narrative.<br /><br />This is funny; I originally set out to write a three star review, saying that I liked it, but didn't understand the inclusion of two chapters--one in Frank's girlfriend's point of view and one in their evil step-grandmother's POV. I was unable to see their relevance and considered them a weakness (and perhaps the product of an editor letting a powerful author have her head), but in the course of writing this, I've changed my mind. Now I know why they're there: they reinforce Ms. Morrison's point about houses, HOMES, and how they both reflect and define their owners. God, that's beautiful. (She did that to me with \\"A Mercy\\", too--I didn't figure out exactly hw I felt about it until I was reviewing the book) I came into this with the thought that Ms. Morrison's theme was, \\"Don't let others define you\\"; after all, she even has a character say almost those exact words. As important as that message is, I think she had more in mind, something more subtle:<br /><br />As it turns out, you can go home again. After all, you carry it within you.relationship.

B00C7TAF3Y|5|i paid more for much less than this game. worth every penny. smart, sophisticated,  and beautiful graphics, loved every moment of it...waiting for the room 2....
B00RVC3YKI|5|Stunning! The 10 yr evolution of the characters is flawlessly executed. This film is destined to be a classic.
B00W3V83QW|5|Love it, but man can it be frustrating :)
B00KNWYDU8|5|This game is great it is fun to play
B007VUCAVO|5|The product is easy to use and makes it easy to check your battery. Everyone should use it to have s visual of you battery.
0811821846|5|This book is great! Lots of Puns on the Stars Wars, amazing for boys who want to get into cooking with out &#34;girly&#34; cookbooks.  Got this for a 7 year old who has been recently watching Star Wars.  He loves it!  I thought it was hilarious too.
B0064X7FVE|1|I am really amazed at how much longer my battery lasts since I dumped this app. I was losing lots of battery power on a kindle that is only 6 months old. Got rid of this app and now I have a much longer battery life. Plus the new web design is a mess. Even the opening page is messy when the designer places words on a background nearly the same color.
B000244FDW|5|We have owned a VHS for the show for years. So we bought a DVD to replace it when it wore out
B004WDRT1Y|5|LOVE IT! The 3D version is AWESOME!
B0095ZQ36G|5|The authors tell a story most people would not know about. The enemy pilots were real people with families, friends, and fears. Most people just think of them as evil automatons. This could nor be further from the truth.
B004XJRQUQ|4|Very good trilogy. Starts strong keeps stronger finishes good. Definitely worth the read. Good for young adults and 30 something's too
0471381985|5|This is a very lucid, practical introduction to the principles of value investing. It is detached, relatively objective considering the authors' bias in favor of the subject, doesn't hype or hard-sell and, on the whole, would be a valuable addition to any investor's bookshelf. If you're a relative beginner, your shelf will also need to include a dictionary of financial terms - the authors assume you already know the vocabulary. And who is the Graham cited in the title? He is Benjamin Graham, who all but invented security analysis. With coauthor David Dodd, he produced the book Security Analysis in 1934. Later, Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor. Both books are investment classics and have been revised and re-issued. This one may endure, as well, based on its thorough exposition on how to value a company and its instructive profiles of value investing heavyweights. Our recommendation: strong buy, long term hold.
0792838084|5|This one is for those Tom Hanks/Meg Ryan fans. Comparable to 'Shakespeare in Love.'
B008SAZHLQ|4|Really great book...Nice and light, hope there is a sequel
B0054JZC6E|4|nice. game good enough very fun and challenging game but I'm trying to beat all of them.  easy least lemon squeezy
B008JMKN4Y|5|I absolutely loved this book! I am a sucker for a man in tattoos who loves a woman unconditionally, which is basically my husband. I also believe that opposites attract. Abby and Travis are perfect for each other and the chemistry was out of this world. I love a happy ending and this one definitely made me happy. I have already recommended this book to all of my friends. Please read if you get a chance!
B008XG1X18|5|I absolutely love pinning on Pinterest!  This app was very easy to download and functions perfectly.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5|I live having the word at my fingertips with instant access! best app for on the go! listen as you drive to keep focused on the goal!
B008673ZAQ|4|This one was good, had me confused some. I don't like Corinne she, and I don't like how Gideon keeps messing with her head. Now I can't wait for the third book, so I know what happens.
0307990850|2|Luckily for me, I didn't spend any money on this book.  I have been an ardent fan of the Reacher series from Day One, and this one comes across like it was written by someone else besides the usual author.  Child phoned this one in, forgetting to include suspense and most of the usual Reacher sarcasm and satisfying battles.  He gratuitously kills off a sympathetic charachter, and when the plot is revealed, it's a big yawn.<br /><br />I will get other Reacher books, but the next one had better be good!  As for the movie, I won't even see it.
B004FOA84A|4|This was my first experience with this sort of game. My nephew and I had a blast trying to figure out the clues. It had vey nice graphics and it was very challenging. The only thing I would change is, I wish it was longer. We had it solved after just a few hours. But for $0.99, who cares? It was worth it:-)
0812589041|5|Ender' Game is a very interesting novel about a genius boy who overcomes and becomes his worst fears. Being abused by his brother and almost everyone except his sister Ender learns to hide his fears. He was a third child and everyone hated him for it except the government because he would be their last chance to save the earth against the buggers. Ender makes it into battle school and is isolated; whenever he would make a friend they would move him. They would never let him stay in one place too long. Because of all this he was not really a happy young boy but he kept going to save the world. Ender was always determined to win and so he never lost a single battle. He graduated early and became the commander of the third invasion without even knowing it thinking it was just a game. But he won the third invasion and did not know till he completely destroyed the buggers. Ender was a very strong and intelligent person. All he ever wanted was to have friends and be happy but they would not let him do so. In my opinion this is a very good book and I have and will continue to recommend it to other people. It puts childish and manly characteristics all into one little boy, which in my opinion is great. And although he never had anyone and was always alone he pulled through. I liked everything in the book except that Ender did not find out about how the bugger's wanted peace until after he wiped them out but on the other hand he fixes that problem by trying to find a safe place to put the last remaining bugger queen egg in a safe world.
0762451319|5|Bought this for my daughter mainly for the necklace! It is beautiful .She was very pleased! She enjoyed the booklet and tattoos as well. thank you.

B00IVD2HMW|3|for a free game, it was ok.  Graphics were nice, but I wish there were more things you could find.  Not really a lot to look around for.  The puzzles were fun.  I finished the game pretty quickly.
B00L23RCPU|3|Very intriguing with several plot switches that were unexpected but delightful - added to the entertainment for sure!!
0884271153|5|Awesome!
B000FFJ85I|4|I confess, prior to this album, I had barely heard of AFI.  Further, if not for the dramatic video to Miss Murder, I would never have been interested in the band or this album.  I have heard long time fans deride the song as a \\"sellout\\", but I disagree.  I can't begrudge the band for wanting to have a hit record, and Miss Murder and this album certainly deserve to be that.<br /><br />Although shelved in the \\"punk\\" bin of record stores, AFI is really a fantastic alternative rock band, and this album would be a crowning achievement for any group.  The songs are subtle, atmospheric, and draw you in more and more with repeated listenings.  Now, for some, that might be code for \\"boring, slow stuff\\", but that's not the case.  There are slower songs on this album, to be sure, but there are songs that rock as well.<br /><br />Above all else, it is obvious that the band CARED when it put together this album.  Every effect is deliberately placed for maximum effect.  Cryptic lyrics on many tracks leave you thinking about the album hours after you've finished playing it.<br /><br />Best lines:  \\"If you believe in me, how can I be dissolving?\\" , \\"For a change, I'll refrain from hiding all of me from you,\\"  and \\"I lose the joys of life, one at a time.\\"  This is an album for intelligent adults, ladies and gentlemen.<br /><br />With that in mind, if you are looking for a great \\"car\\" album or an album to play at the beach, this isn't it.  This album demands...and deserves...your full attention, at home, with no distractions.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear other AFI albums.
B005ZOBNOI|2|I read two chapters and had to stop.It's not that it isn't well written; the subject matter is just too hard for me to read.
B008Y7CGO4|1|This was a very strange movie.  We fast forwarded it and it didn't improve.  Did not like it at all.
1491509791|5|Awesome book! I actually enjoy it better than the Percy Jackson series
B0049P1ZZQ|5|It arrived super fast! I got it way in advance of my Xmas shopping at the time and am now just waiting to get a deal on Season 2! Got this for a steal during Black Friday and my husband and I love the show.
B005IQZB14|4|I have a hard time rating this book. On one hand, the biography is of a young woman who basically is a mess since her mother died and she thinks hiking the PCT is going to help her &#34;find herself&#34;. She is very open about her life. On the other hand, it is interesting what she feels about the PCT and the people she meets. I can't understand how she did it without any experience, but it sounds like there's a lot of people out there who try it.
B00B2FLDRQ|5|It's funny, perceptive and well written.  I laughed out loud throughout and although I did guess the end, there were still some twists.
B00001ZWTS|1|Wild, Wild, West is undoubtedly one of the year's worst films.  One of the factors that makes the movie so frustrating to watch is the fact that it is based on one of the most inventive and original shows I have had the pleasure of seeing.  Inventiveness and originality are lacking in this mess  of a movie where the script is horrible, the one-liners stale and the  performances wooden(except Kenneth Branagh, whom you feel sorry for trying  so hard to be evil).<br />Will Smith is stripped of the charisma that is his  best selling point.  Kevin Kline, a talented actor is reduced to playing  second banana to an uninteresting hero and I have a hard time remembering  Salma Hayek is in the movie.<br />I didn't really expect it to be  &quot;good&quot;, but I at least expected it to entertain me, instead of  providing rest I didn't need.  What a waste!
1607747308|4|This is a sweet book and I enjoyed Kondo's helpful approach.
B0001L3LUE|4|Errol Morris is a GOD. No, I didn't say he's THE god, just A god. The man simply makes brilliant films. I think anyone who lived as an adult during the 1960s should flock to see this film. I didn't enjoy this movie as well as some of Mr. Morris' others (\\"Vernon, Florida\\" is, in my mind, one of the best documentaries ever), but it still rates 4 stars.  <br />
B000O1799U|2|With all the hype about this film/musical being based loosely on the Supremes, I expected to be treated to some 60s music, or at least an approximation of the Motown sound of the period.  It seems as if the singers in this film have the talent to sell that sound, if in fact it had been incorporated into the movie, but it's not there.  With the many references to the events and culture of the 1960s in the script I'd think the film would at least make an attempt to emphasize that unmistakable Motown sound, but I guess the context here is the 1980s Broadway show and its made-for-Broadway musical schlock and NOT mid-60s soul music.  That is a shame and it ruins this film for me.  Cue up any Supremes song from  1965-67 before you watch this film and then decide whether this stuff has anything to do with the kind of music they made.    If this is not important to you, if you think a film succeeds based on extravagant costumes, big Broadway-Vegas production numbers, lots of attractive faces, and utterly forgettable but loud music, then you may enjoy this.
B0014I4KH6|5|She loves this CD. She sings and dances to all the songs on this CD every day. Well worth the purchase.
B008GXHOFW|5|I purchased this app for my Kindle for the grandsons to play. The 5 year old spotted it a few days ago on my Kindle and could hardly put it down to go outside and play football. Knowing how much he loves football I would rate this game a 5 star.
B00B2V66VS|5|Great
630438551X|5|One of the most imaginative and compelling Shakespearian adaptions I have  ever seen. Luhrmann gives the MTV generation something they can relate to  and puts a hard edge on the fairy tale like version from Zeffirelli. The  leads give passionate performances esspecially from the very impressive  Claire Danes. Shakespeare was a writer who knew people and Baz Luhrmann  gives the younger generation a taste of classic literature which on a  regular basis is strictly bound to the classroom. A fantastic follow up to  Strictly Ballroom and well worth every good review it gets.
B00PB5AO4G|2|The improved version of 'Dots' is more entertaining.
B000XUBFE2|4|It's a book you can read quickly start to finish.  It covers all the bases - happy, sad, set-up for ending that you don't realize but makes sense.  It skirts the edges of what's really going on in Germany, but if you know - you can fill in the gaps yourselves.  Just a good book.
B00003OSSL|1|I was not expecting much when i went to see this movie but it turned out to be so dull and lifeless I found my self wanting to walk out of the theater. The characters are a bore and the plot drags on slowly throughout  the entire film. Ford and the main actress exhibit the same colorless  expresions and acting throughout.
B0063M22QO|4|I have never really played this game before but find it quite a fun and enjoyable game to play.  Looking forward to hours of  playing.
B004RJMUJO|5|A fun and great way to waste time. No problems with the application.

B001GKJ2F2|5|I went into this movie expecting allot of great gunfights and action scenes... That's exactly what I got... If you went any deeper it wouldn't satisfy but it did what I expected...
B0052RDHTM|4|considering this is a work based on history, whatever twists and turns going on could have been true to fact so where this book had them or not is insignificant.
B004J4WLB4|5|Fabulous.  Such an interesting and real story. Such great writing.  I couldn't put it down.  I would love to read it again.
B009UX2YAC|5|This app is so fun it would be even more funnier if we get to design our own character
B004TTMYQG|4|Get this app! I actually paid for it on Android Market and use it everyday now in place of the HTC calendar app. Syncs great with Google Calendar and actually lets you edit, after-the-fact, the Calendar that you set your appointment to. Good stuff
B0020BUWX2|5|Its currently 1 am and I want to read the second book I didn't even know existed! Haven't been able to put this amazing and emotional piece of literature down since I started reading it yesterday. I love this book so much and I cried because I could feel everything Mia was feeling and wow I am so upset I don't have the second book! I need this second book now

B0000640S2|4|Where &quot;First Blood&quot; was a low-budget sleeper hit about a Vietnam vet still caught up in the nightmare, &quot;Rambo&quot; is a much larger and more elaborate fireworks display of an action film. Stallone's John Rambo is offered a potential pardon if he returns to Vietnam and brings back proof that there are still American soliders being held captive there. While there, he starts a one-man war against the sadistic Vietnamese soldiers and their Russian counterparts (led by everyone's favorite villian Steven Berkoff). &quot;Rambo&quot; is in may ways a marketable action vehicle for Stallone using patriotism as a good excuse to use every weapon imaginable to blow up everyone and everything in sight. While it does try to provide a message about the war and its importance, it is rather difficult to take this loud over-the-top live action toy commercial seriously as a &quot;message movie&quot;. As a fun piece of adrenaline-filled action, it does however do its job.
0060278269|5|\\"Abhorsen\\" is a fitting end to the wonderful Sabriel series, it embarks on a journey from the Old Kingdom to Ancelstirre to the Ninth Gate.<br />While \\"Abhorsen\\" is quite wonderful story, at its conclustion, I found myself longing for more, because Garth Nix's storytelling is mesmerizing...
B00ECUARO8|4|I love Matthew McConaughey and he looked sexy in this movie. That being said, it was a great movie! It kept you guessing right up to the end. The 2 young boys who were the co-stars did a fantastic job and I look forward to seeing them in future films. I know there are always questions you can ask at the end of a movie, but this one plain left you hanging. That was the only downside to this movie. I would watch it again happily.
0316066524|5|On my third attempt to finish this remarkable book I finally made it.  Full of psychotropic arcania, tennis trivia, frustrating obscurity, and moments of high comedy, any attempt to synopsize this post-modernist epic would be an exercise in futility.  Don't consider any attempt that you have encountered to tell you what the plot is, or what the book is about.  The emotional range is stunning, with moments of genuine despair, revulsion, joy, and triumph.  The style ranges from the most esoteric (I don't think I've ever used my dictionary more) to straight-forward and declarative.    What I will say is this:  Differing from any fiction I have read in the last ten years, this book haunts me; it gnaws at me; it invades my thoughts at unexpected times and in unexpected ways.  Sentences and scenes come to my mind with hallucinatory clarity.  My vision of the world has been subtly changed.    The book is not without flaws, and the sheer logistics of reading it, with its 200 pages of endnotes - some of which are chapter length - make the challenge of reading it all the greater.  Yet I think that was part of the author's plan.  There must often be pain to temper the pleasure.    So as to not sound too serious, I should again mention that this book is full of humor, often laugh-out-loud humor.  But I find the book ultimately sad, profoundly sad.    For those with a taste for challenging fiction, often brutally honest, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.
B0054JZC6E|3|it works pretty good on my kindle fire and the more you play the more games you get so its kind of addicting when you have time to kill. its free why not
B005P1YCNK|5|A book that took us back to the basics! It shows why success is not retained by the children of the successful, especially if they have not imbibed the basic principles outlined in the book.
B000QXDEDG|5|For a film based on reality or history, it contains alot of unashamed fantasy and virtual reality. Yet it is pulled together in a balance of weight and seriousness, and the elements of escapism and brutality actually complement each other here. Were it all highly detailed and painstakingly realistic, it might be too laborious to view (unless you wanted a visual history), and were it more fantasy based it would belong in the Star Wars section (and no 'non-nerd' people would want to watch it). I cringed occassionally at the obviously digital effects on screen, but as a whole this was a VERY interesting movie that I definitely enjoyed watching and would watch again.   The characters were respectable, believable and dignified, even though they are made to entertain us.   The digital effects and scenery were rich and artistic, while being dark and non-distracting enough and thus only supported the interesting dialogue and scenes.   It created a near-dreamy effect that played on the imagination and senses and made the viewing experince more rich, without the need for over the top tricks or scenes.   This is a very sensuous film, all sexual elements aside.  The elements of humanness or romance or weakness were not captured in a 'cheesy' or campy way as is typical for almost all movies (IMO) but blended seamlessly into the atmosphere of the whole movie all togehter as an emotional, political, social, and human drama.   I recommend it to anyone who typically shys away form the theaters (like me lol) because this movie actually isnt that bad. It WONT disappoint you like so many others and its definitely enjoyable for a casual evening on the couch :)
B00DQZQPNM|2|This fits my Kindle perfectly but it does not stay in position once its suppose to be in one of three position options. This only works if you plan on not moving your kindle at all and if you do it will come out of place and will end up flat on the ground or table.
B002JVWR4A|5|This series is really awesome and is going to make a great gift for the Bones fanatic in our family.

B00LU0P9L4|5|I truly enjoyed this game.  Challenging and rewarding to play.
B00L9B7IKE|4|Great suspense with twists and surprises to story.  good main character development.  A fast fun read.
B000059XUO|4|This is by far the only one in the entire series that is worth watching.  However it is very good and stands by itself as a cult classic.  The visuals in this movie are great the story is a very haunting one.  Brandon Lee was taking from us too soon as this movie proved he was going to make great films.  A great edition to anyone's movie library.
B0089LOG02|5|Sad and happy like life.
B003YL4LYI|5|His best book yet. It keeps you guessing and routing for your favorite characters. Too bad he kills them off....
B0053ZOQMK|5|Johnny Depp is great, as usual, in this animated movie. Great movie for adults. Watch for the Fear and Loathing reference.
B005LAJ16I|5|A must watch series, well acted, exciting and interesting to the end and has you wanting to watch series 2.
B008K3HRF0|5|This movie is a must ! I have a 3 1/2 year old watching it and she LOVES it.... Also the older kids think it is good.  Great for the whole family.
1451695195|3|Positive: Interesting and facinating story near death expedienses. Approach is professional<br />Negative or to be improved: Scientific and medical science jargon  is not easy to follow up by ordinary reader.<br />This makes reading laborious and slow.
B00BSBT8M6|5|Would like to watch it again and really pay more attention to it.  it was not what i was expecting.
0156027321|4|This book didn't make me believe in God but it was a great survival story. I wouldn't have thought so from reading the book jacket, but the adventures of Pi were entirely plausible! I was completely caught up while reading of his trials at sea.      The beginning of the book was boring and I almost stopped reading it. I'm glad I persevered. I didn't care about the religious or parable aspects - I read it strictly for the adventure aspects.
B002G1YPH0|3|def get an aftermarket fan, im to lazy to go get my own, really REALLY good for the price however

B00005A0N5|5|While wandering over the metal section at a record store, an employee grabbed a copy of \\"Oceanborn\\" and said: \\"Have you heard this band?\\" I had not yet uttered a negative answer and he was already removing the cd wrapper. He immediately proceeded to play me bits of the songs. I WAS BLOWN AWAY!! I have been a metal fan since about '89, and from 93 onward I have gotten into a lot of different genres, from Jazz to Reggae and beyond. On the last 3-4 years I have bought only a couple of metal cds, because I was a bit dissappointed with the whole genre. Bands seemed to be playing the same old cliches, and new bands were no exception. But, when I heard Nightwish, I saw the sky open up. Here was a band crafting music equal parts technical brilliance, emotion and innovation. And Tarja!! I am absolutely in love with her voice!! I get chills down my spine every single time I play this cd. Amazing. Brilliant. Power to spare. Arresting emotion. Get it.
6304994540|5|The Coen Brothers use bowling as their metaphor in this inimitable tale of mistaken identity, art, and a rug that really tied a room together.  Jeff Bridges (in an Oscar worthy performance) is Jeff Lebowski, a character who  goes by the name &quot;The Dude,&quot; has a penchant for white russians,  and seems to be perpetually mired in the '60s.  When the wife of another  Jeff Lebowski (the &quot;Big&quot; Lebowski, played by David Huddleston),  is purportedly kidnapped, the Dude and his friend Walter (John Goodman as a  singular-minded Vietnam vet with his own unique perspective on life and the  rules by which it must be played) bowl their way through the ensuing  turmoil, which includes a band of nihilists (lead by Peter Stormare), a  stranger (Sam Elliott) who assists in the telling of the tale, a man named  Jackie Treehorn (Ben Gazzara) who is a self-styled purveyor of adult  entertainment, a rival bowler named Jesus (an hilarious turn by John  Turturro), a moronic pair of rug soilers, a local beach community constable  long on attitude, a shady private eye, dreams subject to myriad  interpretations, an errant toe, and a marmot.  Rounding out the stellar  supporting cast are Steve Buscemi as Donnie, the third member of the Dude  and Walter's bowling team, Julianne Moore as the Big Lebowski's daughter,  and the ever versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman as his assistant.  &quot;The  Big Lebowski&quot; is stylishly crafted, wickedly funny, and will leave you  craving more of the same.
B0098WZDZ8|5|I gave the album 5 stars because it's Rainbow and it's a great album, made even better with this deluxe edition.  But, the version of 16th Century Greensleeves is the same version used on disc 1, and that is very depressing.  It would have been nice to include Stargazer and A Light in The Black as bonus material.
0385512104|4|The book is written in a semi-diarist style. The supposed author of the book is a very high-functioning 15 year-old autistic child. We follow him as he tries to find out who killed the neighbours dog. Our hero has an incredible memory for detail, but is unable to empathize or step back from these details and thus handicaps him in daily living. There were some minor inconsistencies in style to enable the story move forward a bit quicker and I thought that the author wrote himself into a corner (to create some suspense) at one point that he did not get out of too convincingly.<br /><br />If you liked this story I would suggest reading Flowers for Algernon.
068817776X|5|Absorbing, well-written WWII memoir.

B000002PCS|5|I can still remember trying to find the ALBUM after I saw the movie.  It would instantly have me in tears for years after.  Even now, 18 years later, when I listen to the cassette, I know exactly what rifts of music  went with what scenes of the movie.  John Barry probably had no clue of the  &quot;timelessness&quot; of his soundtrack.  It is his best work in my  opinion.  Go, John!!!

030758836X|4|this was a pretty interesting book. it was a little slow starting off but totally worth the read. the stuff that goes on and the twisted ended made for an exciting and crazy novel. i would recommend this book.
B00K7IPGS6|5|Excellent movie. Probably one of the best on the series. Recommend for anyone who loves the Marvel universe.

0060931671|5|...although that's still not very accessible. But this book is worth the trouble of grappling with the author's obscure allusions, open-ended questions, and maddening mixture of the deadly serious and the utterly  nonsensical. Still, compared to his massive tomes GRAVITY'S RAINBOW and V.,  for instance, the general outline of CRYING OF LOT 49 is relatively  comprehensible. Oedipa Maas, a confused child of the sixties, stumbles upon  what may or may not be a centuries-old conpiracy as a result of being named  &quot;executrix&quot; of her wealthy, eccentric former lover's estate. The  sinister, fascinating glimpses of the &quot;tristero&quot; that  increasingly obsess her may be genuine insights into a real but previously  hidden reality, an indication of her descent into paranioa and madness, or  a colossal practical joke. She has no way of determining which, and neither  do we. On some levels this is frustrating, but Pynchon's hilarious,  eccentric, beautiful prose and the original, fascinating plotline keep your  interest, and certainly satisfied me, at least. His irreverant takes on the  superficiality of both the counterculture and suburban America, the  banality of bad Jacobean revenge melodramas, and the illogic of scientists,  historians, and almost everyone else continue to delight me on rereadings.  It may not be as great an achievement as his longer masterworks, but I  would rather read this more enjoyable and accessible (although still  profound and troubling) little book anyday.
0517543052|3|This book reminds me of the pictures I used to draw while experimenting with natures substances. Lots of drawings and non-sensical illustrations.
B003L77GH4|5|This was a great deal! I was so mad because walmart ran out so quick on black Friday but I got it for almost the same price on amazon. I got it quick and have already watched the whole season. I will definitely be using amazon again for future purchases!
B00LP9E79U|1|I can't believe I sat thru this one.  I kept waiting for something to make some sense...  no luck.  I hated it so much I am taking the time to write this review.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

B00004RFFS|5|Anne Rice created the modern vampire with her novel, and the movie did it justice. Brad Pitt is definitely what makes the movie, he plays the role of the depressed vampire Louis perfectly. This the movie also has the very young Kirsten Dunst playing the role of Claudia, and she is an amazing actress for one her age at the time. The overall film is just perfect, from location to wardrobe, it feels like a trip through time. It's just a shame that the second movie wasn't as good as this movie. The movie \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" will go down in movie history as a classic and won't be forgotten any time soon if ever.
B000XUBC5E|4|Well written and kept my interest.
B00E3QJ7ZG|4|Very glad I waited for this to come out in Blu-ray and wondering why it's taken so long compared to other Eastwood films in his &#34;Man With No Name&#34; sub-genre. Eastwood's 2nd directorial effort (shortly after Play Misty for Me), it's not quite as good in plot (storyline) as &#34;Outlaw Josie Wales&#34; or &#34;Pale Rider&#34; which came years later, but only by a little as it's still a good tale. The cinematography and his directing are quite strong. There's plenty of action and enough depth to the story to keep interest. It has the typical gunslinger stranger arrives to town in extremis (or about to be) from a gang of ruthless ruffians. However, this one has a significant twist that the town's &#34;elders&#34; have brought the situation upon themselves (any more about this would be a major spoiler). Everyone pretty much gets their just deserves by the end; there is Karma.<br /><br />This film was a sufficient enough break from the traditional &#34;Western&#34; (as epitomized by John Ford's films) that it prompted John Wayne to write Eastwood a letter telling him this film did NOT represent the 19th Century American West, its values or its traditions. Perhaps Wayne had dismissed the Sergio Leone &#34;Dollars Trilogy&#34; that preceded this, and their popularity, as aberrant foreign Italian-Spanish imports (it had been some number of years)? What about Sam Peckinpah's &#34;The Wild Bunch&#34; released four years earlier? Perhaps it wasn't &#34;Western&#34; enough. In any event, Eastwood's &#34;High Plains Drifter&#34; is one of the films that continued to break down the 1930's-60's traditional Western genre, redefining it with Bad Men that aren't totally Bad, and Good Guys that had their own significant flaws. Critically acclaimed when released, it's well worth seeing, as it was part of the continuing evolution of the &#34;Man With No Name&#34; Western sub-genre.
B004SJ3BCI|5|Got this app for my little cousin. It keeps him busy and he loves angry birds all versions of the game.
B00C1BTWV4|2|The audio was not good .. Actually even with the surround sound system, the effect wasn't at all there.. Movie is good, but the audio wasn't at all ..It is better to have a DVD/BluRay instead of getting it rented.
B00FCQQ1IW|5|To be honest right up front, I have never read a Jeffrey Archer book that i didn't like.  This is no exception.  However, I just had a birthday and turned 78.  I did not read anywhere that this would be his cliff hanger to end all cliff hangers and as i knew I was coming to the end Ithought  this would be the last one in the series.  Was I ever wrong.  READING ALERT, READING ALERT.  YOU HAVE TO WAIT TIL 2015 TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS.  I wrote my family and told them that I might not live that long and it would be a shame to not know the outcome.  Having read every Jeffrey Archer that I know about, I also know that he does not mind killing off a beloved popular character if it will enhance the story. Unlike many authors I have read over my lifetime, I cannot  play out the next installment in my head.  Archer is unpredictable.  I compare this to Downton Abbey and the episode that ended the season when Matthew was killed.  But  I did play out a whole season in my mind before the next one came out.  Mr. Archer, please hurry up the release date of the next one for a little old lady in Texas.
1451695195|5|Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander, which is now 26 weeks on the NYT best seller list, is an autobiographical account of the near death experience (NDE) of a 60 year old neurosurgeon who taught at Harvard for 15 years and achieved high success in many professional publications, over 200 conference talks, and in surgical practice. A dedicated scientist who heard several NDEs from his patients during his long practice, he assumed that these experiences were mere symptoms of the dead or near dead brain. He contracted an extremely rare (1 in 10 million) bacterial meningitis which put him in a (Biblically suggestive) 7 day coma with a completely \\"dead\\" neocortex, which is the large part of the brain responsible for all conscious experience and much more. All previous cases lasting half as long as his affliction resulted either in death or a permanent vegetative state.<br /><br />Leaving aside for the moment the momentous question of whether his astonishing NDE was a mere biological symptom, the book is gripping as (1) a medical documentary and (2) an odyssey. Just as it's fun to read The Odyssey, The Aeneid, Dante's Inferno, and Milton's Paradise Lost (Eben's experience has striking parallels with Paradise Lost especially), Eben's book is worth reading as one of the greatest visionary stories of all time.<br /><br />His NDE was similar to most others, but amplified by the putative total flat-line of his neocortex. Unlike other NDE's, he had no memory of who he was during his visions, presumably because of his completely disabled neocortex. His consciousness was literally selfless and pure and went further and more vividly into a transcendent state of knowledge than all other documented NDEs. His experience of the divine is surely one of the most compelling ever narrated.<br /><br />He points out that prior to his NDE he was not really a skeptic of NDEs, for true skeptics at least read about what they are skeptical of, and prior to writing down his visions, he never read anything on the topic, for his scientific mindset was firmly entrenched and cursorily explained NDEs. Dedicated skeptics of this book have one major and one minor criticism in their favor. The major criticism is that he does not address a rebuttal by one neurosurgeon reviewer: that his visions could have occurred when his brain was reviving from the coma. The minor point, which I arrived at, is that, though he apparently achieved a miraculous, indeed the only, case of complete mental recovery, perhaps he does not admit that the 2 months recovery time he claimed was needed to regain all of his medical knowledge was in fact never complete, and he realized he must earn money in another way. After getting to know this person through the book and interviews, one would have to be an awfully enthusiastic conspiracy theorist to believe the minor criticism. Eben's appendix about the medical science that could explain his visions mitigates the major criticism but does not invalidate it.<br /><br />Faith always requires a leap from evidence. All evidence of the divine is circumstantial at best. (I'm haunted by the consistency with which the best of such evidence remains so precisely circumstantial). My broad reading in quantum physics, in the empirically established prescience in predator-prey and other animal interactions, and in the few well-documented paranormal events, leaves my scientific mind disposed to believe that Eben's NDE was indeed an encounter with a dimension of our universe that abuts the one us mortals experience, and that after death we will go to that dimension.<br /><br />In a clash of titans, Einstein debated Neils Bohr for several years over the implications of established facts that had already proven the validity of quantum mechanics. As one physicist framed this debate, \\"Upon its outcome rested the entire enterprise of science, and its triumph over superstition, religion, and magic.\\" Over years, in papers and at preeminent conferences, the debate swungone way and the other, with apparent victories undermined by a subsequent argument. In the end, Einstein, pale and shaking, conceded victory to Bohr.<br /><br />Since that monumental defeat of \\"the last great classical physicist,\\" science has reclaimed some of the battlefield it lost that day. But it did so at the expense of accepting proven postulates, like Bell's Theorem and the role of the observer, that, when actually read and understood as much as laymen can, are just as incredible as the claims that NDEs are visits to another dimension of the universe. Accepting those proven postulates--and not to accept them is to dismiss science--opens doors to accepting NDEs as proof of other dimensions of consciousness that await the expiration of our short little lives here.<br /><br />After reading this book, one has the option of assigning a probability that NDEs are visits to another dimension of the universe. Until now, this is what I've done with NDEs and several post-quantum cosmogonies. But the impact of this book on me was to force a decision 100% one way or the other. I chose to believe that Eben's NDE was a visit to the afterlife. I always remain open to new information that could change my mind, but for now I'm all in. Once all in, the implications are vast and deep in how one responds to life--life including death--and for me that journey has just begun.<br /><br />~Rob Laporte<br />Greenfield, MA
B009NH6JRE|4|My second favorite season so far with the Second season being my favorite. This was a really good season I really enjoyed the merle darryl subplot. Rick spent maybe a little too much time going crazy though.
B00ANDDBBE|5|I love all the Doctor Who films (well, not the original series - I tried the first couple and couldn't watch it - really corny).
B00IUBM8PQ|4|Very good movie. Usually disappointed in sequels but quality and story line were all there. I haven't read the books but even the people that have seem to enjoy it.
B008Z9YLV2|2|Kids should not be watching this let alone reading this book. This was marketed all wrong. PARENTS SHOULD READ THE BOOK FIRST!
B002VPE1AW|5|This movie was the best Movie I had seen in a long time I watched it in 3D and 2D both were great Highly recommend 3D if you get the chance.     Hope they are going too make a part two         Thank you
B009GEFXLC|5|Drama, action, and comedy; you get all three in this show.  The mix varies from episode to episode, so there is plenty of variety.  The main characters are vibrant, but not extreme.  We enjoy the reruns, which is about the highest praise we can give.  There is both character and plot development as the series progresses, so you will want to initially watch them in order if possible.
B00L9B7IKE|5|lot of twists and turns beginning to end
1596912863|4|Being a JA fan I'm always on the lookout for a creative take on Miss Austen's work.  Some are cringeworthy, others are fantastic; fortunately, Austenland by YA author Hale falls closer to the latter end of the spectrum.  It is built on the brilliant conceit that, somewhere in England, there is an historic recreation of Jane Austen's world, replete with Empire waists and haughty gentlemen, which caters to the whims of an exclusive clientele.  Jane Hayes has entered this rarefied fantasy due to the largesse of a dead aunt, and Hale's witty dialogue and talent for humor add up to a rollicking, if necessarily genteel, holiday from her abysmal love life.  Chapters open with a take on Jane's succession of bad boyfriends, and these help fill out our perception of the heroine.  Well written and fun, this is a fast read, a literary chocolate-covered marshmallow marred only by a hurried and muddled ending that should not detract overmuch from this fun romp through Austenland.
B006885LZM|5|Love it
B00D7Z4GQY|5|Very well written. Lots of intrigue. One of the best books I've read in a while.

B0090P98Z4|4|feels and plays like classic hack-n-slash games:  diablo, baldur's gate,  champion's,  etc...  decent so far,  and as typical with glu games - a good experience can be had without spending real money.

B00005ATQD|3|Tom Cruise has been a favorite of mine since Risky Business, and Nicole Kidman is one of those actresses that comes off classy, intelligent, and still radiates sex.  Kubric was a master who created some of my favorite films of all time.  And sex - who does not like sex - with a nice touch of kink.  But by the end of this movie I just felt sort of let down.  It was the celluloid equivalent of the girl that flirts with you for hours at the party, and then suddenly says \\"Well good night,\\" and she's gone.<br />Cruise plays an wildly successful New York doctor who is becomes obsessed with his wife's confession of a fantasized affair.  The confession comes out during one of the many uncomfortable and awkward conversations had in this film.  I am sure Kubric wanted us to feel uncomfortable at these moments, and Cruise and Kidman deliver.<br />Cruise, troubled by his wife's admission goes forth into New York and tries to have his own extramarital exploration.  But he fails.  He fails with a patient.  He fails with one of the super-model like hookers one always finds on the street.  He's wealthy.  He's smooth.  Hell, he is Tom Cruise!  And he cannot get any?<br />This leads him to the discovery of a mysterious and elite traveling sex club and to the most erotic and intriguing moments in the film.  With an aesthetic of the The Story of O meets the Spanish Inquisition at a mansion in the New York suburbs, my interest had now been peaked.  Here are the elite of society indulging in all manor of erotic pleasures behind the anonymity of masks... and then it is gone. Tom is soon back on the sidewalks of New York - still troubled, still [excited], and now afraid for his life.<br />So we have a mystery - or suspense.  No.  That, too, is quickly diffused and we return to awkward conversation.  The fuse just fizzles and goes out and the fireworks never go off.<br />The combination seemed so right, but the talent behind this film just does not make up for a poorly focused storyline and the decision to use the most intriguing element as a simple plot device.nd the decision to use the most intriguing element as a simple plot device.
B00BLCHZC2|5|Great show, I enjoy the characters and the actors do a great job playing them. It has action and even some funny parts thrown in to lighten the mood. Enjoyed the show very much.

B00Y6QF0PE|4|Been waiting on his version or his thoughts to explain the time away from her. Just as anyone obsessed with anything or anyone, he was drawn to her being something her could not control. So true to his interview in the beginning of the her side of the story. Definitely showed why he didn't understand an average person, he could not buy her, consume her like he could a thing. He only figures out after she leaves and communicates with the doctor what has happened in such a short time. Amazing love story where one sees how consumed one can be by another. I would like to hear the rest of his side.
B005LAIH9A|5|I collect all the American Pies and didn't want to spend the money to go see it in the theaters. I went and bought this instead of spending that money I now can watch it in my convinces when I want..
B0085YNML2|4|Munch is adorable, and I love the little face he makes when he eats the grub.  The game play is good and visually appealing, but the levels can get quite challenging, which is a bit of a frustration at times.  Overall, a great game that I highly recommend!
B00001U0GQ|2|The Last of the Mohicans is my favorite movie, but the DVD version is terrible.  There are some added scenes, but what they don't tell you is that they also took out scenes and changed some scenes from the VHS version.  I was happy to see a few scenes go - the &quot;someday we will have a serious disagreement&quot; line and the &quot;we are a breed apart&quot; line.  The scenes that were added to the DVD weren't very important to the storyline.  The only ones that were decent were from the surrender at the fort.  There was more dialogue added to the very end of the DVD version, but I thought the VHS version had a perfect ending, and the added footage came across as a bit preachy. What ruined the whole DVD version was a change they made to the end of the fight between Magua and Chingachgook.  The gruesome ending to that fight was edited, probably to make it less gruesome, and it ruined the whole movie. So if you loved the VHS version, don't buy the DVD version - don't even watch it.  And if you have seen the DVD but not the VHS version, watch it and you will see a huge difference.<br />Also of note: the dialogue in the VHS version was hard to hear in a few places, with the music and sound effects.  I thought the DVD would be better enhanced, but it was not.  I had to use special features of my DVD player to enhace the dialogue, which I have never had to use before, and it still didn't help much.  I had to replay a few scenes with subtitles to know what was being said.  And I also had to crank the volume way up.  So overall it was a VERY disappointing DVD, I recommend sticking with the VHS unless they make the same version for DVD.
B000OVLINI|5|I really enjoyed this book.  I had to put it aside half way through due to other obligations, and when I picked it back up, strayed up until 4am reading it.<br />It speeds up near the end and is hard to put down.
1607747308|4|Interesting approach.  Really challenging !  For &#34;art & design&#34; people who use a lot of &#34;stuff&#34; for a challenge, this is pretty tough--against the grain.
B00CNQ7HAU|5|As expected from the Master...a great adventure with twists and turns...and a little &#34;legalese&#34; that is indicative of a Grisham novel. HIghly recommend for any Grisham fans....or just those who enjoy of tale of intrigue...fortune...spiced with a little laughter.

B005723JSQ|5|I have read most all of Sophie Kinsella's books to date and this is the best one to date.  If you are considering purchasing it and like her style of writing, this is a must-read!  It has several twists that you do not expect.  I read the book start to finish in one day.  And when I came to \\"The End\\" I said No! Not because of how it ended but because I didn't want to be done!  I really loved it and found it so entertaining.  Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to the purchase of this book!  You will not be disappointed!
B007SZ0E1K|5|it can take everything i throw at it and still take more, i dont use major process hogs like editing software so the biggest spike in usage is when i play games on the machine
B00DRPVE3M|5|I'm crazy about UNO &amp; Friends ,it's so exciting and addictive I just can't get enough! I play it every day  and there's always a new and interesting challenge.
B00J7VYKFO|5|I can't add much to what other enthusiasts have written.  There is such a depth to this gem of a CD, and the guitar work will blow you away.
0792844882|5|This film allows you to enter a parallel universe where Las Vegas is sexually charged and menacing. A land through the &quot;Phantom Toll Booth&quot;. There is no need to try to follow the plot as it is wafer thin  and obvious.<br />No, you can spend your time indulging in the campy dialogue,  the energy charged erotic dancing, Dave Stewart's perfectly suited music,  and the fit bodies on the screen.<br />10 out of 10 for entertainment value.  But Paul Verhoeven was right to end his relationship with Joe Eszterhas  after this. Minus 5 for overt and shallow misogyny.
B00992CF6W|5|It's awesome
B000E1ZBGS|2|It might be that I'm a purist, but I felt that there were a lot of things about this adaptation that were just WRONG. When I first saw it, I was determined to give it a fair chance- I came in knowing that there was probably a lot that they would have to cut out so that it would not be 5 or 6 hours long, but I did not expect some of the strange things that they added instead. <br /> Elizabeth Bennet just didn't seem right to me- she didn't have nearly as much sweetness as was needed to balance out her \\"archness\\". To me, she came off not so much clever and lively as having a 21st century bad attitude.  <br />As for Darcy, I was happy that he was a little more sympathetic than he had been portrayed as in the A&E version, but they also took out so much of his arrogance and pride that it makes you wonder why he was so universally disliked in the first place! Besides this, the second proposal and the final \\"goddess divine\\" scene seemed like it was taken straight out of some cheap Romance novel. <br />However, so that I do not seem so incredibly negative, I might also mention that there were some things that I did like quite a lot. The music and the cinematography was beautiful, and some of the secondary characters were just about right- Mr. Collins and Lady Catherine especially, barring the odd scene when Lady C. comes to the Bennets' house in the middle of the night. <br /> <br />All in all, it was a pretty good movie- it just wasn't Austen.

B004XGN8W4|1|The screen is too dark to play Black Ops 2
B00F0AI9Y4|4|I like Most of the songs on this Album, but some seem more country-themed and doesn't fit well with EDM at all, none the less avicii did Alright
B0087GJ8KM|5|Selling is integral to so much of our lives. Daniel Pink writes well and uses good stories to back up his points. He uses research to back up the stories and shows *why* things are true. I have learned a lot from this book and it is a fun read.
B00O7UED2A|1|Stupid game .... a waste of time... glad I didn't pay for it.... uninstalled!
B007EC27QM|5|This app is very handy to have. My daughter even uses it for her math homework. If I am in the store and need to do a simple calculation, I just get out my kindle and use this app.
B00F91FRTO|4|I like Emma Watson.
B008IBPMZG|4|Ohh the proper British drama.  If you like Sense and Sensibility then you'll like this.
B00G6HO368|5|Though I've never finished the book, this DVD came highly recommended from a very good friend so I decided to give it a try. I absolutely loved it. Superb acting by all of the cast. Indeed it was. The mother was hysterical at times. I loved how Colin Firth portrayed Mr. Darcy. And Jennifer Ehle was just as great as Elizabeth Bennett. It is probably my second favorite love story of all time, the first being Romeo & Juliet. I've watched this several times already and will continue to watch it. I may even give the book a second try now that I've seen it and loved it.
B0027ZCQ4E|4|Great movie! I wish to &#34;rent&#34; the next one, but Amazon only offer it to be purchased????? Very wrong move.
B0046B8GEQ|5|I didn't have great expectations for this movie.  I thought it would be so-so.  I was pleasantly surprised when we watched it as a family last week.  It is funny and sweet with a nice mix of mischief.
B00008NRI8|2|&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie.
B009LZH5AI|5|As long time viewer of TBBT, it has been fear that over the years the show would become stale like many shows that last as long as this show has now in its 6th season.  But this show is still as creative as it was on day one.  Can't wait for the next episode!
B00F7YHDWC|5|This is the best app I have ever found. There is no gore, and the deaths are - cute? I love this game! Don't get dumb ways to live. The graphics are bad, . Unlike this game there . Is gross blood. Get ways to die not dumb ways to live.
B007R11DKQ|5|Love this movie! It has everything for everyone action adventure romance comedy in a magical realm. 👍👍 two thumbs up!
B00EI4V3X2|5|This is my 2nd purchase of Turtle Beach. My teenage son loves these! Loved that they were wireless, with his new PS4
B00C7O8MJ8|4|Soundtrack lacks the depth of emotion I had hoped for but I'm glad I own it. It's good. Try it.
B0007TKNII|5|Exactly what I ordered. My daughter loves this movie to pieces. It's one of her favorites movies of all time.

B005FI6IRG|5|In the language of wine, Cencic is \\"charnu\\" and Jaroussky is \\"bois&eacute;\\". Wine is \\"bois&eacute;\\" when the new wood of the barrel in which it has aged gives its taste to the wine and I would say the wood used for Jaroussky's vocal barrel was redwood or even maybe sequoia because it erupts into the sky like a spear of life out of some dark underground lair in the earth. Light, very slender and agile it climbs to heavens in one leap. On the other side wine is \\"charnu\\" when its body has some density and some fleshy elasticity. The dense vocal flesh of Cencic is like the embodiment of the light slim bones of Jaroussky. They are the two inseparable parts of the same being, the body and the skeleton without which there is no soul and the soul is the music. The best wines are those thar are \\"charnu\\" with a good \\"bois&eacute;\\" taste behind and throughout.<br /><br />If we listen to them like that, and no one can ever mix them up even when they sing together, we can see the music they sing live under our own eyes. One illuminates the other though Cencic is dark and yet brilliant with the light of the sun reflected into him by Jaroussky who is the selenian moon in the sky that reflects the light of the sun into Cencic and who takes its splendour from this darkness that you feel in Cencic and surrounds Jaroussky. Cencic is the roots of the tree of life and Jaroussky the fronds of that very same tree of life. And the tree of life is their music.<br /><br />We can only approach those two countertenors via metaphors because the simple music lovers who do not like technical words have not yet found the plain words and language with which we may be allowed to speak of these two admirable and adorable singers who are just enjoying their mystery and who don't want us to mix and meddle with their shared feelings and emotions. So we, the simple music lovers, are supposed to provide the dress and attire of this evanescent form we can hardly perceive through the images it brings to our minds and the empathy that Jaroussky and Cencic are sharing something that go miles and aeons beyond whatever we can imagine.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the victorious warrior Achilles who is able to hold the whole world mesmerized in front of his decision to suspend his support and let us die bloodless just because we do not deserve the privilege of winning the war against ugliness and inhumanity. Too bad for us but luckily there is Patroclus. Achilles gets his strength and will find his right mind in the love that unites him to Patroclus. Achilles is the whimsical inspiration of the moment who follows his guts and emotions whereas Patroclus has a sound sense of responsibility that comes from the unfathomable depth of history. And Patroclus sends Achilles back to the battle field, back to the music. And Achilles wins but launches Patroclus with him to the victory line. The Trojan Hors of these two is the music they share that invades our ears and ours souls. We are defeated like puppies in the claws of two eagles.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the batter on his home plate and Cencic is all the others, and first of all the pitcher, around this god, this king, this mysterious priest of an enigmatic religion, that of baseball. But the batter is nothing without his home plate on which he stands, and all the others are nothing without this home plate they have to reach and touch, and the batter in return is nothing since the value of the homes plate on which he stands comes from the need for the other, all the Cencics of the game to reach out and touch that home plate. How can you cut Jaroussky from Cencic without sterilizing the whole world of each one of them and of both, the whole world of us all. Music is a collective game and the batter is little without the pitcher who throws the ball and the players who have plenty of things to do to score and the audience who is suspended to the outcome.<br /><br />Jaroussky is the nibbana the illuminated spirituality worshipper is trying to reach so than when he dies he will finally be able to escape the curse of being reborn again, but Cencic is the eightfold path the illuminated spirituality worshipper has to follow to reach that nibbana. There is no escape from the curse of life if we don't have that path of enlightenment and illumination. There is no beauty if Jaroussky and Cencic do not sing together and bring us the nibbana of perfect passion and passionate perfection.<br /><br />But more than anything else Jaroussky is David and Cenci is Jonathan, the son of King Saul who hates David and wants Jonathan his son to kill him. But it all goes wrong because David without Jonathan's love is dead to the future he carries in himself, and Jonathan without David's love is dead for God and salvation since he would become a plain and ordinary murderer executing his father's orders and everyone would hate? He prefers obeying Saul's folly who sends him to fight some Philistines, though he Jonathan knows he will die in that battle, but then he would not have to kill David and be rejected by God and David will eternally love him beyond his own death. That love between Jonathan and Davis is so well rendered by Handel in his opera Saul. And the story comes from far away:<br /><br />\\"17:57 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.<br />58 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.<br />18:1  And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.<br />2 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home to his father's house.<br />3 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him as his own soul.<br />4 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him, and gave it to David, and his apparel, even to his sword, and to his bow, and to his girdle.\\" (1 Samuel 17:57-18:4, Bible, American Standard Version)<br /><br />To finish with that CD, I have to speak of tracks 22 and 23. In both Jaroussky and Cencic are two young men who are in love with the same woman. Instead of fighting to the death or one treacherously killing the other, or the other committing suicide out of despair, they come together and cannot find any way out of their curse. Since they love the same woman the same way they are forever linked and bound together in a love that is beyond the way they love the woman they love, the love of two souls tied up together in some kind of a fix.<br /><br />\\"That noble light / leads my soul / enthralled and bound.<br />Following those footsteps / my loyalty could never / live more contented / or more happily.\\" (track 22)<br /><br />Their contentment is in the common love they share and in the common resolution to walk together away from this woman since they are bound together and cannot cut themselves from each other but neither one nor the other will ever forget that woman and the love they feel for her.<br /><br />And again:<br /><br />\\"Say, god of hearts / if there is any pain equal to mine.\\" (track 23)<br /><br />Imagine these two excerpts sung by the two men together in absolute love for that same woman and you may understand the blending of the two voices, both obviously male in their harmonics, and one always on top of the other and yet we never know which one is on top and the other under, and yet you will never mix them. They are so different in their sameness and so identical in their specificity.<br /><br />That's when you understand that it is a crime against artistic humanity to have female sopranos replace castratos... or countertenors and male sopranos in today's world. It is true some of the best conductors do it. Well at least one does not and it is William Christie.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUn when he dies he will finally be able to escape the curse of being reborn again, but Cencic is the eightfold path the illuminated spirituality worshipper has to follow to reach that nibbana.

B00I2TV3NO|5|It was great. I enjoyed it more than the first one.
1558216847|5|For those of you who doubt whether a person can walk out of Siberia, I had a Polish great-uncle who was captured by the Russians at the end of WWI.  He was sent to a work camp in Siberia, managed to escape, and worked his way across Russia...through Western Europe...across the Atlantic...and finally to Wisconsin, where he showed up at my great-grandmother's farm in the mid-1930s.<br />For those who doubt the existence of Slavomir Rawicz, I quote from a letter tipped-in to a signed first British edition of the book in my posession.  At that time, Slavomir and Marjorie (his wife) were living on Bondgate Street in Castle Donington (between Sheffield and Nottingham).  My volume was presented to Reverend Father Grasaw--their parish priest on March 26, 1956:<br />&quot;Dear Father Grasaw,<br />My husband would be very pleased if you would accept the enclosed copy of his story.  You have always been a good friend to those who are exiled and lonely, and a good friend to him.<br />I hope that you are well, I often think and pray for you and the work you are doing.  My family and myself send you our very best wishes. <br />God Bless You.<br />Yours Sincerely,<br />Marjorie M. R. Rawicz&quot;<br />I wish that my great-uncle were alive today, so that I could document his own story in the tradition of THE LONG WALK.  I'd bet that he and Slav would have some interesting stories to swap.

B00RY86HSU|5|Great
B009ZQFSRA|5|the movie plot is quite creative, the action scenes are somewhat cheesy but for when it was made it was not bad either. the dystopian theme is quite like a Fahrenheit 451/ 1984 inspired script. Christian Bale does a decent job playing the protagonist. It overall is very worth watching.

B00DU73T08|3|Not great.  worth watching.  Boring and slow in some spots.  the girl they cast was not a good fit for the role.
B00B4804KS|2|This is about the 3D edition of the movie only, not about the movie itself or previous editions. I have mixed feelings about this particular 3D edition. In geneal, the 3D feeling is not spectacular, yet nice, with rounded edges and lots of volume; but there are flaws. First of all, there's far too much ghosting. Second, and most importantly, Universal has done it again (yes, yet again!!) and has gone too far with the DNR reduction. There is an unfortunate loss of detail (the previous 2D blu-ray edition is much more detailed), all clothes look like they are made of plastic, faces are waxy (especially middle shots, where they look plain ridiculous) and the background vegetation often looks like green jelly. This was in a 55' Sony TV with active glasses; maybe smaller screens or passive glasses with diminish these defects. But most of all, this movie was never intended for 3D, so there are no \\"on-your-face shocking effects\\" or intended use of the environmental 3D either. What was the need of this? Oh, yes, extra cash on a film already sold in many other different formats, of course. Recommended only for hardcore fans of either Jurassic Park or 3D movies...and even so, think about it.

B00RVBY8KO|1|What a waste of 3 hrs, no plot, no drama, it's like all the hype is just about getting you sucked in to watching 12 years of time-lapse photography. &#34;There's nothing like it!&#34; says one critic, well that's true enough, and maybe the reason why is it's just HORRIBLE. Seriously, the most dramatic moment is a drunk dad throws a glass, wow, really? I admire the director for his persistence over 12 years but MAN this thing is BORING. This kid is SOOO self-centered, so self-reflective the whole movie is about ridiculous teenage insights into the meaning of life. Jesus, I'm sorry, I saw this on the cover of Entertainment Weekly and then I saw the box art and I thought that this might be something cute like &#34;The Wonder Years&#34; or something just nice and sentimental about growing up. What it is is TWELVE YEARS OF TIME LAPSE PHOTOGRAPHY, yes, unique, yes, boring as all get out. I would of had just as much fun watching a movie made over a period of 12 years of my front lawn, yep, trust me, boring.. I'm no Neanderthal, I don't need explosions and car chases to keep me interested, but c'mon the writing on this thing is just beyond horrible.. all these spoiled kids do is reflect constantly on themselves, their middle-class lives and the meaning of it all. And I mean constantly to the point where 20 minutes into the film you're already ready to throw up.. My wife put it succinctly after the movie was over &#34;Gee, try and get a REAL problem..&#34; I mean the biggest problem these kids face is going away to college.. cue drama! Oh, right, there ISN'T any associated with that.. UGH.. this film is just beyond horrible, I'm sorry, I wouldn't be so harsh if this was a 90 minute film, but this director expects you to sit and watch almost 3 HOURS of a film ABOUT NOTHING other than seeing the time-lapse of the main character grow up. If this is what substitutes for &#34;Hollywood buzz, Oscar buzz&#34; and the like then I'm afraid our film industry is in dire trouble. Wait for the next film by this director &#34;Twelve Years of Watching Paint Dry..&#34; it'll be just as interesting. Trust me, pass on this..or the next film by this director &#34;Twelve Years of Watching Paint Dry..&#34; it'll be just as interesting. Trust me, pass on this..

I <br />just like this album because this has 1 decent song in Shattered. <br />Tattoo You has another good song in Start Me Up.

0855329483|5|I purchased both of Ann Cox's books on silk ribbon embroidery.  Beautiful books, they both offer clear instructions and beautiful photography.  I'm hooked!  I've used the silk ribbon embroidery for both making cards and as a way of embellishing crazy quilts.  This book is Ann's second book on silk ribbon embroidery.  Her first book was geared to beginners.  I would recommend purchasing both of the books at the same time as they follow each other nicely.  Periodically, I run across \\"must haves\\" for my craft library.  I'll refer frequently to both of her books and am very glad that I purchased them.  Highly recommended!
0060825219|4|It takes a bit to get into, but this is a wonderful tale of relationship from a male point of view.  As a woman, it was so enlightening to me.  I liken it to a musical \\"impromptu\\" -- not a piece with defined limits, but one with a journey.  ...and a conclusion!  Masterful writing.
B00GTO6X0W|4|In the early 20th century, a literary movement known as Naturalism caught on as war suddenly began to grip America once again.  Influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, Naturalistic writers wanted to emphasize the dark, harshness of life as well as man’s lack of control of the natural forces that truly guide his fate.  All is Lost is as close to cinematic Naturalism as I’ve ever seen.<br /><br />Robert Redford plays a character whose name is never revealed, a typical trait of Naturalism as these forms of expression look to stress nature’s indifference to man. This indifference is further exemplified with the film’s opening scene where the man (Redford) awakens from a nap below deck on his sailboat to find that a stray floating cargo container had somehow drifted into the side of his boat, puncturing it and resulting in the boat quickly taking on water.  No explanation is given for this circumstance or than that it presumably fell off of a cargo ship and, as fate would have it, collided with the boat.  The man is a pensive man; he does not react wildly or make rash decisions, rather he weighs his options and relies on his experience and skills.  Redford’s is the only character in the entire film, and he is also a man of few words; accordingly, the script for All is Lost is only 32 pages long.  Thus, writer/director J.C. Chandor’s film looks to explore modern Naturalism at sea as deliberately as possible.<br /><br />All is Lost is a riveting achievement.  As we watch this man struggle through a series of events set into motion by that seemingly innocuous cargo container, we are forced to mull over our own mortality and our own suitability to circumstance.  Last year, Ang Lee’s adaptation of Life of Pi beautifully captured some of what All is Lost attempted to capture, but that film was far more Romantic in its aspirations.  All is Lost instead puts plot aside and seeks to pit man against nature in a rigorous, albeit somewhat predictable series of events.  The result is a compelling yet extraordinarily minimalistic effort that does feel redundant at times.<br /><br />Earlier this year, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n’s Gravity also pitted man against incredible odds in a far more successful way.  While both films depict man’s struggle with expertise, Cuar&oacute;n, like Ang Lee before him, understood the need to make the film a visual spectacle as well.  Thus, those films certainly utilize the media of film far more than All is Lost, while All is Lost relies more on Redford.  Fortunately, Redford delivers.  The sharp, witty con-man from The Sting is no more, but he has been replaced by a weathered and beaten sailor who may have the grit to do what Johnny Hooker never could – win an Oscar.  B+<br /><br />All is Lost is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 46 minutes.  It is a nailbiter and a triumph for Redford.  The score by indi-rock name Alex Ebert is also characteristically right on.is a compelling yet extraordinarily minimalistic effort that does feel redundant at times.<br /><br />Earlier this year, Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n’s Gravity also pitted man against incredible odds in a far more successful way.

Thus, those films certainly utilize the media of film far more than All is Lost, while All is Lost relies more on Redford.  Fortunately, Redford delivers.  The sharp, witty con-man from The Sting is no more, but he has been replaced by a weathered and beaten sailor who may have the grit to do what Johnny Hooker never could – win an Oscar.  B+<br /><br />All is Lost is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 1 hour and 46 minutes.  It is a nailbiter and a triumph for Redford.  The score by indi-rock name Alex Ebert is also characteristically right on.
B007ZXK08C|4|Fabulous read! You go from loving a character to hating it and back to loving it. The end was just perfect.
B000001ELR|5|This is, in my opinion, the best KISS album of the '80s, if not THE best KISS album ever. This album shows what a rock group should really be about. As usual, Paul and Gene jam with their outstanding, unique voices and instrument-playing. Not quite sure who did guitar here, Ace or Vinnie, but whoever it was, they did a very good job. Eric Carr, God rest his soul, did not surprise me here when I heard his knock-out drumming. I personally think he was and always will be the best drummer to walk this planet. DANGER is my favorite here, with the awesome guitars, Stanley's wonderful singing, and Carr's hard-hitting drumming. The rest of the songs are just as noteworthy, and if you're just a rock fan in general, I think you just might take a liking to this outstanding album.
B005544TRQ|5|Really good show. Good writing and good acting.
1451613520|5|Excellent history of US that is easy to read, chock full of details and information told from a perspective we do not otherwise learn in school. Rather than history written from the perspective of &#34;victor&#34; (the &#34;special interest groups&#34; that came out on top, often by controlling the state), it is written from a perspective of the &#34;loser&#34; (U.S. interests that failed to emerge victorious from inter-group rivalries) and from the rest of the world. Delionizes U.S. leaders and their policies.

1416955070|5|I FREAKING love this book!! I like all the characters, love the action and the story and the heartbreaking love! This book was absolutely fantastic! It had the perfect amount of thrilling adventure and humor and emotional moments to keep me going from beginning till end!<br /><br />Clary, for how ordinary her life had been, took everything really well. She was courageous and kind girl who I can easily relate to, especially when she mentions something DD or anime related! She's not super kick-ass yet, but she was still really brave in facing all the obstacles and smart in finding where the Mortal Cup was.<br /><br />Jace, you make my heart sing! Your sarcasm and wit were truly a thing of legend. I lost count the number of times you made me laugh and even shed a tear or two near the end. I love how Cassandra Clare showed us how lovable and attractive Jace is (through other ppl attempting to engage him), instead of just telling us over over again.<br /><br />I love how Clary and Jace slowly grew close together. There was no cheesy insta-love in this story! Oh yay! Finally! Anyway, they were two people thrown together by circumstances. Yes, Jace was a bit curious about Clary in the beginning, but who wouldn't be? But he didn't spout cheesy lines like she was special or something, but their feelings were clearly shown through their actions and words! Nothing was ever really said, but as a reader I knew their feelings and sympathized for them. I love how this was done!<br /><br />As for all the secondary characters, I love Simon the most of course. The scene with the Greater Demon Abbadon and Simon absolutely made me swoon. Yay Brains over Brawns! Alec and Isabelle are both super likeable. Alec's inner struggle touched me and through him I also came to love and understand Jace even better. All the secondary characters made a great cast in this book!<br /><br />Now for the plot. It was truly non-stop action. Half the time I couldn't turn the page fast enough to find out what's going to happen. The pacing was perfect, with character development interweaved seamlessly into the action. We really got to know Clary through her actions, not endless inner reflections and broodiness like in a lot of YA I read recently. Not for a moment did I lose interest in the book. Near the end was an emotional rollercoaster that made me cry a little (maybe a tear or two). I cursed my busy schedule and midterm season for making me stay away from this book every time I had to put it down!<br /><br />Lastly, the writing was terrific. Cassandra Clare had a way with words that transported me from my room to New York. I was with Clary all the way through her journey. I could picture every scene clearly in my head and be totally immersed in the atmosphere that the author had set for the scene. It was a darker New York than the real one, but the Shadow World came to life and I was a part of it.<br /><br />A fabulous book that is 100% worth the hype!<br /><br />Rating: 5/5!!!!!!<br /><br />Note: I will not say anything about Jace and Clary's relationship because I'm hoping that Cassandra Clare has something else up her sleeve to change the situation! Oh, and I noticed the similarities to Harry Potter. It's hard not to, but still, it was such a good story! Besides, it has fewer similarities to Harry Potter than some other YA books that are basically Twilight!<br /><br />Ning @ Reading by Kindle Fire
B000000OU6|5|In \\"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere,\\" Slash proves something that most of us alrady knew: he is a great guitarist, who plays with more passion and soul (he's half-black) than any other guitarist in the past 20 years. I'm tired of hearing this stuff from pop music magazines saying that \\"It's 5 O'clock Somewhere\\" is bargain bin fodder. First, I had to play $15.00 for this CD and it is impossible to find in any bargain or used CD bin. Second, the music on here is really good. Let's get started:  1. Neither Can I 10/10- One of the songs that is hard-rock influenced blues, instead of vise-versa. Amazing song about suicide and is one of the few songs on here where the lyrics are above mediocre, here they're really good. Slash & Co. sound great, even Eric Dover is amazing.  2. Dime Store Rock 10/10- Not rock music about a dime store, but the song is about rock that you would buy at a dime store, I'll let you firgure the rest out. Fast paced, great song with great guitars and remarkable riffs and hooks. Slows down into another blues song at the end.  3. Beggars and Hangers-On 9/10- Has one of my favorite riffs of all time. Could have been the best song on the album, but the verses are slow and boring and the riff doesn't show up until the chorus.  4. Good To Be Alive 7/10- Complex song, but nothing special at all, and Dover's vocals are annoying.  5. What Do You Wanna Be 9/10- I like this song, but some will find Dover's vocals annoying on this one too. A fun song, but most of the band except for Slash is mediocre. Another song that slows down for a bluesy ending.  6. Monkey Chow 9/10- Great song and melody with stupid lyrics written by Gilby Clarke, one of his only contributions on the entire album.  7. Some City Ward 10/10- For whatever reason I found the lyrics sort of funny: \\"He missed the pool by inches, so he won't be walking soon.\\" Hahaha. Sounds a lot like Aerosmith's \\"Nobody's Fault.\\"  8. ---- the Pit 10/10- Short instrumental with the first half being fast-paced hardrock, and the second part, bass-influenced blues written by Alice in Chains and Ozzy alum, Mike Inez.  9. Lower 10/10- Took several listens before I liked this one, but now it's one of my favorites on the album. Like \\"Neither Can I\\" is a blues song with a heavy hard rock influence. One of the only times in music history where that thing on the guitar with the tube where Slash makes his guitar \\"talk,\\" actually helps the song, unlike Peter Frampton.  10. Take It Away 8/10- Decent song is made worthwhile from Slash's solo.  11. Doin' Fine 6/10- A stupid song about a never-ending party, comes close to filler status.  12. Be the Ball 9/10- Even though the song is simple lyrically, is very complex musically. Slash and Gilby Clarke sound great together.  13. I Hate Everybody (But You) 6/10- Even with funny lyrics and one of the best solos on the disc, this song is a waste of time.  14. Back and Forth Again 9/10- A ballad that actually isn't that bad, with Slash's best solo on the album.  Slash had originally written these songs for the next GNR album, and they almost were (Axl loved them) but him and SLash had an argument so Slash formed his own GNR with Clarke, Sorum, and Reed; Mike Inez replaced McKagan, but Duff helped write \\"Beggars.\\" Many people complain about Dover's vocals, but for the most part, they are very good. A very good album that is overlooked because it does not have the GNR name on it.
B000021Y77|4|only people who actually think throughout the course of the day need to buy this movie. it's fantastic, but it won't do much for drones and zombies who live most of their lives without ever developing any insight on anything. It's interesting and entertaining at the same time, and it leaves you to consider how time plays such a big role in our lives and our encounters w/ people. If you don't buy it you should rent it b/c it will get you to thinking.
0385341008|2|Could not get into this book.  My mom says once you get about 1/2 way through it's really good.  But I could not pick it back up as the first three chapters were really boring...

B00005ATZT|5|The performances were brilliant, the pacing and direction were phenomenal.  I think this was the best film of its kind in the 90's.<br />I am amazed Andy Davis isn't one of the most in-demand directors in the industry frankly.
B00910Y1OQ|5|Pretty neat. Takes up a chunk of time to play. Great graphics. Wears the battery down but what do you expect?
B002QE3CTY|5|Why this needs a 5 is because it is one of the best books out there. I hope you like it if you read it. I'm gonna tell you something about this book it's a cliff hanger.
B00K6TQSDI|5|My little grandson figured out the password to buy games. He must like it a lot because he's always taking my phone to play it
B004A8ZWSS|4|This is an excellent action/adventure movie and I was very happy to see two of  my favorite actors on the same movie. Johnny Depp delivers a great job of a confused  and out of place tourist. Angelina Jolie as an unknown agent is wonderful.  As usual I found that the DVD version was more than I had hoped for.
B008Q00PHY|5|it kept me very interested and sassy feeling. plus I love seafood and beer. Hale berry is so hot in this movie
B007UXSPK2|4|usual but popcorn fun tom and his antics. They waste time in a sandstorm and some of it comes off just too unbelievable to even have entertainment value but certainly fun for his fans.

B003O86FMW|5|This series is amazing. I thought the hunger games was amazing! This book is about the dramatic part of winning the hunger games. And the ending! It was the best ending ever
B007SGLZP8|5|I have read every book John Grisham has written.  His plots are suspenseful and the endings surprising.  If you haven't read a Grisham, try it -- you will enjoy his page-turning style.

B00NEQRNVG|5|Wonderful continuation of Gideon and Eva's story. Left me hot and bothered in places, and excited and hopeful for their lives together by the end. I can appreciate that they needed to make drastic changes in order for their lives together to be good. And Cary' s story line has to come to some kind of peaceful end. I kind of felt like the ending had a cliffhanger aspect to it.

B00AB7HESI|5|I bought the Scribblenauts game for DS, then I bought Super Scribblenauts. I play them both ALL the time. Then I saw this. 0.99?! That's like nineteen dollars cheaper than the DS game. And it's basically the same! I recommend this app to creative people looking for a good game.
B004GYY714|5|I found radio stations that I enjoy listening to and have only begun to explore the many, many stations available. I listen on my Kindle Fire daily.
014241543X|4|I loved this book, and can't say anything more than what others have said already.  Adam and Mia's relationship was impressive, her friendship with Kim was a good one, amazingly good for two teen girls.      The only criticism I have is that I struggled with interpreting the ending.  I know that squeezing a hand while in a coma is a good sign, but it was never clear to me if she was staying or not.  I could have used more validation about that.  I would have liked knowing for sure, because I recently read a great book by another author and was sure that she had lived but when I emailed the author she told me no - the girl died!  Another junior fiction novel.  I was happy to hear from the author, but shocked that I hadn't been able to deduce that critical piece of information, so I was unsure about this one.    My daughter, who is 13, just finished reading it, and assured me that she decided to stay by squeezing Adam's hand.  I hope this is the case.  But it's another one of those - should I email the author to make sure I interpreted it correctly?  I think there is a good, relatively hazy but still clear way to let the reader know she is choosing to live, and I felt I needed that.      Did anyone else feel this way?

0767834739|4|I watched the third (and hopefully final) installment of the Resident Evil series last night (Resident Evil:Apocalypse). <br /> <br /> You should see it if you want to see the most expensive (tens of <br />millions) and well done violent zombie destruction - huge monsters with <br />rocket launchers- exploding helicopter machine gun violence - fashion <br />models with dual machine guns - even a good nuclear explosion - ever put <br />in a movie. In addition, all the heros are really fashion models <br />(really, they are.). There is also no dialogue. Really. Not even a <br />little. Just screaming, barking of orders and commands to \\"LAUNCH!!!\\". <br /> <br /> The best part about the movie is that the plot is so horribly <br />unbelievable it borders on comically insane. Characters that were <br />formerly captured and imprisoned suddenly show up fully armored, healed <br />and ready to save the day. The story is not even cohesive in any manner, <br />and is so absurdly indigestible as to be insulting. Suspension of belief <br />doesn't even begin to cut it and at some points in the movie I was <br />forced to yell \\"OH COME ON!!\\" in disgust. Deus Ex Machina literally <br />rains down from the sky like a hurricane. It was clearly written by a 12 <br />year old, and a poorly educated one at that.  <br /> <br /> But the explosions are great. Especially the nuke. Highly <br />recommended. A+++++
B005ZOBNOI|5|John, you can still do better. I believe in you! But this is still amazing. The characters feel real and brings focus to the person and not the illness. This story hits me in the feels. It made me contemplate my own life and what I'm choosing to do with my time on this earth. It's inspirational and makes me want to help reduce world suck.

B00A6CCF0K|5|Great book! I just couldn't put it down. So many stories and characters intertwined into perfection. All characters have a purpose, none of the chapters were \\"fillers\\" every single word was value added to the plot.
6305428050|2|I bought this DVD based on the 87 good reviews. There was a one-star rating, but I thought it was an odd data point. I forgot what my HS history teacher told us: 50,000 Frenchmen can be wrong. Frankly, those who thought it was a 5-bagger must have all their taste in their mouths. I also question their sense of humor: there's not much that's funny about this film. <br /> <br />Still, if you are dying to watch a movie, and it's the only thing on TV, go for it, but don't waste your money buying it. <br /> <br />PS. Some of the language is a bit hard for a PG-13 rating. I don't advise watching it with kids. <br /> <br />PPS. The poster artists' immagination never ceases to amaze me. There is nothing in the movie that even comes close to the picture on the cover.
B002G1YPH0|4|I like this cooler, but its HUGE.  The downside to this style heatsink/fan combo is that you cant use the window side fan of your case.  Pretty big bummer for additional cooling, but I guess this guy does its job.  The other downside I noticed is that the Core Temp is 60 celcius, while the proc temp is 49celcius.  Not sure if this is a case cooling problem or the heatsink itself.  Either way, if I clock from 3.6ghz (stock) to 4.2ghz OC'd, the 60 degree temp doesnt change...  Only the CPU temp.  So something else might be the culprit.  Does what its designed to do.
0804106304|4|The Joy Luck Club is a highly enjoyable and interesting book about a group of Chinese mothers and their daughters. The women form a club when they move from China to San Francisco. They hold weekly mahjong parties where they share insight and tales with one another. <BR> The novel tells the stories of oppositions in their lives and differences between the generations. The author Amy Tan uses many symbols and themes to relate the relationships of the family members and friends. Her uses of vivid descriptions help the reader to better understand the diversities between the Chinese and American cultures.<BR> One major theme in the book is the translation from the cultures. It is portrayed as being quite difficult and challenging.<BR> \\"A mother is best. A mother knows what is inside you,\\" she said...\\"A psyche-atricks will only make you hulihudu, make you see heimongmong.<BR> Back at home, I thought about what she said...These were words I had never thought about in English terms. I suppose the closest in meaning would be \\"confused\\" and \\"dark fog.\\" But really, the words mean much more than that. Maybe they can't be easily translated because they refer to a sensation that only Chinese people have.\\" <BR>This quotation is from a conversation Rose Hsu Jordan and her mother An-mei have about Rose seeing a psychiatrist about her problems, but refuses to confide in her own mother. The incomplete understandings of the mothers and daughters cultures are due to the fact that they have an incomplete knowledge of language. This act as a barrier between the mothers and daughters. <BR> The daughters know some Chinese words and the mothers speak some English. This is not enough to accurately translate intended meanings. Throughout the book, the characters bring up Chinese concepts. The frustrating fact, however, is that an understanding of the Chinese culture is required to understanding its meaning.<BR> The motif of sexism was also prominent in Tan's novel. Most of the characters in the novel encounter sexism, as it is a common problem to both Chinese and American cultures. The women experience rape, feminine submission, and stereotypes. The author makes the distinction between a respect for tradition and a disrespect for ones self as an individual. One of the main characters Lindo Jong speaks of this submissiveness in her narrative \\"The Red Candle.\\" <BR>      \\"I...looked in the mirror...I was strong. I was pure. I had genuine thoughts inside that no one could see, that no one could ever take away from me. I was like the wind.<BR> ...And then I draped the large embroidered red scarf over my face and covered these thoughts up.\\" <BR> The problems Tan discusses are important concerns facing our society. Cultural translation and sexism are two issues I displayed; however, the book also speaks of immigrant identity, communication, destiny, and sacrifices for love. The author accurately portrays the feelings and emotions of women, their children, and immigrants from other countries. The book can relate to everyone regardless of their gender, race, or culture.

B00003CXZ4|5|After seeing an ungodly number of movies in my time, I sometimes think I've absorbed every plot twist and storytelling gimmick known to the worldwide viewing audience.  Thankfully, I'm sometimes proved, to my delight, to be wrong.  Not to sound too highbrow, but I've watched a lot of movies.<br /><br />Memento was the most refreshing movie I've seen since &lt;i&gt;The Matrix&lt;/i&gt;, which is pretty funny when you consider it has both Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantalione in it.<br /><br />This movie will entertain you, but more importantly it will make you think.  Think about who you are, what defines you, how people perceive you, and how you perceive yourself.<br /><br />If you're IQ is higher than 13, you should be able to get some enjoyment out of this movie.  However, if you ever thought Rocky was in danger of losing against Ivan Drago, avoid this movie.<br /><br />-- JJ Timmins

B000002OG8|5|Had this as an LP until I recently re-bought it on CD (for my brother as well). Personally, I think the way to listen to this CD is with headphones. Listen to, say, Throw down the sword, and really listen as the two lead  guitars play the &quot;same&quot; notes (albeit slightly different octaves  (?) ), then they separate, and finally they join each other again.  Fantastic !

B00BD99JMW|5|Now that I think about, I have been greedily devouring every book I see with a post-apocalyptic dystopian theme. Does that mean that I want to see our high-tech nature-poisoning civilization crumble?  Or I just want to be assured that if the worst happens we'll still have capable and honorable heroes to look up to? Tris and Tobias are all that, although it's tiring to read how Tris beats herself up over every righteous decision. In Allegiant we discover the other side of the Faction-driven world. who decided it should be like that, whose family tree roots sucked up the minerals left when the old civilization rotted and got plowed under.  One lesson between the lines is how quickly the trials and errors of the old world (meaning us) will be forgotten when our descendants are reborn in the light of a new day.  Whose self-abnegation, whose bravery, whose genius, whose truth and compassion will bloom and intertwine to make a world less vulnerable to human foibles? And whose commitment to narrow-minded principles will transform them into monsters? And who will make the ultimate sacrifice to bring the monster down? The vision of Veronica Roth is powerful, and her characters play out a compelling parable. This is the lesson: aim heart and mind at the highest goal, and don't get bogged down in the muck.  There is nothing to fear after you stare down your fear and call it false.

0143123173|5|So far, my experience of this book, and indeed the whole series, has been on Audible.  If ever there was a voice that could manage Walt Longmire, Vic Moretti, Lonnie Little Bird, Ruby and of course most of all, Henry Standing Bear, it is the voice of George Guidall.  At this point I can't imagine the books without that voice.  Although I have many audio books (many purchased on the merits of the narrator), I find this the most seamless and captivating series of all.  You never hear the voice of the author, or even, strange though it must sound, the narrator.  It is as if the perfect author, perfect voice and perfect stories have found each other in a perfect dance.  It is to the great credit of Mr. Guidall that I ever started with this series in the first place - I just thought that if he was reading it, I had better give it a listen.  I have now listened to each new book with the greatest anticipation, and never been disappointed.  I highly recommend the entire series, not just as audio books, but as a beautifully defined continuous story of wonderful characters, beautiful and terrible scenery, careful social commentary and engaging plot lines.  I also have to urge, once again, readers to become listeners, and discover the truly enlightening experience of LISTENING to a story.  You could have no better introduction than these stories and George Guidall.
B0009P5YXO|5|a very accurate looking model of the DT's sonic screwdriver, for a toy. I use it at work for signing checks, and i can even use the UV light to check the legitimacy of a check that im cashing. i get tons of compliments on it from my customers. a must have for any serious fan of the series who doesn't want to go out and by the 300 dollar metal replica.
1936891026|5|As a painter, I've struggled with my confidence as an artist all my life. This book is not an instant cure. What it does is identify the enemy of creativity and productivity and it sets the reader in the frame of mind that allows them to over come their barriers.<br /><br />I fight my fears one day at a time and most days I have been winning. I am a lot better off after reading this book.
B005Z271Y6|1|Great voice in a great venue...too bad Adele ruins it all with her incessant talking.  Hello?  After the first time I watch this, I'm not going to want to hear all the jabbering and potty-mouth ramblings.  Does she really expect her audience to play this concert over and over again and have to listen to all that dialogue or fast-forward to the actual songs everytime it's played!?  I don't think so!
B007KZY1YY|3|a bit boring, just the same things over and over. how many times can anastasia roll he eyes? it was a repetition of #1
1476746583|5|Beautifully written.  Especially interesting for radio enthusiasts.  Characters lives are woven together into a great story.
B004HW7JH4|3|This series is unnecessarily full of sexual content. The story line would be as interesting without it. This season is more of the same of the previous seasons. I would not let anyone under 18 watch the stories. It does show clearly the fear of a male dominated business allowing women to join as equals.
B007MC8YLQ|5|This seems a little more dificult than the computer version.  However, it's justas addictive and takes up way too much of my time.
B006DJ2JSI|5|the best dictionary
B00GX59QO2|3|Helen Mirren, Bruce Willis, John Malkovich - I'd probably pay to watch them have lunch.  They don't do much more than that here but it was fun nevertheless.
B00KH1UT1M|4|ok game.  my son likes it.
B004Y1WCDE|3|I got this App for my Amazon Fire TV. I already own an WD TV Live but it doesn't stream Amazon movies.<br /><br />By comparison, WD TV Live does a great job of streaming my .mkv movies from my Synology WorkStation running Plex Server. But it doesn't have the pretty interface that Plex for Android does. Movies are listed by name only, no movie posters like with Plex for Android.<br /><br />Plex for Android app only allows you to skip 30 seconds or rewind 15. But actually, it doesn't. When I try to skip 30 seconds ahead by pressing the button on the Amazon Fire TV remote, a animated 'loading' icon comes up in the middle of the movie, while the movie continues to play behind it for 30 seconds. Then the animation goes away. Uh, I want to skip forward, like your app suggests, not view an icon for 30 seconds. Let me guess Plex, you outsourced your developers?<br /><br />Design-wise, the Plex app is far superior, if only they could get the 'function' part down. I would say their Project Managers and UI/UX designers are top-notch. The Devs need help though.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you want to fast forward at varying speeds from 2x to 32x use the WD TV Live. If you want to play Amazon movies and don't care about fast forward or reverse, and want a pretty UI for choosing a video to watch, get Amazon Fire TV.<br /><br />Note: I also have Chromcast. It works for streaming movies from my Plex server. It's just lacking a remote and it loses connection to my Surface Pro when the surface goes to sleep. So even pausing is impossible until I log back into my Surface, and attempt to play the video again (which asks me if I want to restart form where I left off). Then I can pause the video, already streaming to my TV. My full review of that product will be under that product.<br /><br />Look, all in all this technology is pretty new. So, right now, no one manufacturer is doing everything right. They are all still experimenting and seeing what makes money and what doesn't. Hopefullysomeone with brains will look over the field and see all the things that are being done right and put them all into one package. But until then, I guess we're stuck with 6 devices, each doing well at least one of the 6 features we want, but none of them doing all 6.
B0074MZSWW|5|LIvely music.  Has a unique style of its own.  I like a lot of different style of music and this appeals to me.  I just really like it.
B0009KA7BS|1|Vile adaptation of the great comic book is not only a misrepresentation of what the comic is actually about but an incoherent adaptation as well. It takes the book's premise and literally steps on it for the sake of milking it for a cheap affect. Keanu Reeves is miscast and his performance is so bad, it's vile.  He has a charm but it does not come across here in this film and he looks like he's making a joke out of his performance. Rachel Weisz does carry this movie on her shoulders by giving it its only good performance but she gets no support from the script and the direction, which is flimsy to say the least. The story is incoherent and the screenplay is a mess. The Special Effects were done better before in other movies and the cinematography is shot way too dark to see some times.  <br /> <br />Worth a look just for Rachel Weisz's better than the film performance but other than her great effort to be better than the horrible script, the rest of the film lacks not only her professionalism but her grace as well <br />
B005ZOBNOI|5|Excellent character perspective. Great story line. The character development was good. I like that the female character is strong and determined
B009UX2YAC|5|It's awsome
B00ABGEFWC|4|But when you purchase the actual Littlest Pet Shops at the store you can't scan the tag with the front camera on Kindle Fire HD. Quite a bummer. Please fix this!!!!
B0076DCT2G|4|After reading The Lion, was told that The Panther was also a good book to pick up. A little more playful then Lion, it was also hard to put down wanting to find out what was going to happen.
0446573019|3|I read David Baldacci's novels because I find them amusing and entertaining. I'm often most amused by poorly written dialogue or characters that are stereotypes or poorly developed. In his latest novel, Zero Day, Baldacci seems to start from scratch. He introduces a new heroic protagonist, John Puller, and I found myself recognizing the individual and rooting for his success. The fast pace of the plot and the thrilling action kept me turning pages quickly, and I found the dialogue was not as distracting as it had been in earlier Baldacci novels. Readers who like character-driven action thrillers are those most likely to enjoy this novel.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B00FAPF5U0|5|I can sit back after a long day and relax my body while engaging my mind! I really enjoy the challenge of playing Sugar Crush.
B003VANOFY|5|This addition to the lineup of Logitech headsets has certainly brought a new element to my computer/gaming life. it is my first wireless headset and I am amazed at the quality of the sound and noise isolation. In my opinion, this is worth every penny.
B00BD99JMW|5|ty
B007IXWL2C|5|Love so much,I  read all three books in 6 days couldn't put it down .Hoping there is going to be a fourth book
B008KYOCA2|5|This was one of the easiest user friendly calendars and organizer. I found that it was very easy to maneuver through the settings to personalize and customize it to my specific needs.
B009F1ZYCO|5|Fantastic Iron Maiden album and a great addition to my collection of picture disks. Looking forward to the others when released.
B00VRYCGLO|4|Love it
B005HED08I|5|What a treat to watch the old Star Trek series without commercial interruption and the picture quality is amazing!  Already started watching Season Two.
B00BUCXVPI|4|Unexpectedly good, Tom Cruise did an excellent job of bringing the character to life. It's been a while since i read the Jack Reacher novels, this isn't the way i remember the character but still pretty good.
B00ATSBIIG|4|Relaxing but no sound at all, no music or sound effects.
0307887448|5|Great book if you like the 80's, lots of references and things that happened back then.  I bought it for a 60 year old friend who loved it.
B0018087TC|5|Well, of course it is. But moreover, Chet Baker creates an atmosphere, a mood, a memory. Few artists can transmit these things. It's his sound, who he was, how he lived, what he did. I don't want to sound sappy, but if this doesn't reach you then just go on to the next thing...
B0034DGPEU|5|I loved how the author had two narrator's.  She truly gave life to a period of time in our history.  I am now missing the characters.
B0088W4YTK|5|I thought they were both very enjoyable shows. I wish they were still on the air and had not been cancelled. Both movies (&#34;Ark of Truth&#34; and &#34;Continuum&#34; were enjoyable as well).
B002BWP49C|5|this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..
B00CNQ7HAU|5|Could not put it down great to the last page. Grishams  stories always have a righteous ending. You will love this one.
B00VFTA70I|5|Goes well beyond simple entertainment with quality that shows within each characters role. Well done and gripping to watch this movie.
B00007KWHG|5|Great CD with plenty of old time Frankie on it. We bought this after seeing the Jersey Boys and itis a fun way to remember a good time.
B0000AKOVP|5|I bought this album for my best friend who has just taken his first steps into nicer audio at home. I had bought it on vinyl for myself when the album first came out and again when it first came out in CD format.<br /><br />I've always loved this one as possibly my favorite Stones album, but WOW! On a dynamite system with a very good turntable, preamp, amp and some Thiel tower speakers in a room with good acoustics, this one just blew us away when we first put it on.<br /><br />Nice hefty 180 gram vinyl disc feels substantial in your hands and that's simply a bonus in this case.<br /><br />The sound on this record has been remastered and the result is nothing short of stunning. Crisp clean highs, warm thick mids and solid big-belly bass tones - this album is a solid performer across the frequency spectrum.<br /><br />So if you're looking for an album that will reward you every time you listen to it, you might have to work some to get one better than this little beauty.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones at the height of their powers with a little Nicky Hopkins on keyboards thrown in... YESSSSS!
B00CKKDZ2S|5|I love reading before getting up for the day. I keep my eyes closed to pick the cards, I let my outer energy lead me.
B000HKW7E0|4|Great movie lots of gags.... we have a stuffed squirrel as part of our decorations that goes in the tree every year!
B0061JPYX2|5|What a great voice
B00003XACV|5|My favorite soundtrack composer used to be Michael Nyman (who composed soundtracks for Gattaca and The Piano) until I saw American Beauty.  The story and cinematography of the movie were stunning enough, but the soundtrack tied it all together in one beautiful package.  Thomas Newman's music on this CD is playful (Track 6- Mr. Smarty-Man), dark (Track 12- Structure and Discipline), forlorn (Track 14- Angela Undress), longing (Track 16- Walk Home), quirky (Track 13- Spartanette), dreamy (Track 2- Arose) all at the same time.  The use of alternative instruments like the ukulele and bird calls made for a highly inventive, sometimes quirky, but totally appropriate background for the movie.  Nothing was too loud or too overpowering.  And the music of the soundtrack is also strong enough to stand on it's own, you don't have to have seen the movie for the music to make sense to you.  Sometimes, I wish the tracks were longer, especially Track 2- Arose which is my favorite, but it's long enough.  After hearing this soundtrack, I've started identifying Thomas Newman's unique sound in other soundtracks like Little Women (another wonderful soundtrack), the Green Mile, the TV show Boston Public, and HBO's Six Feet Under.  If you love soundtracks, definitely give this one a listen!
B0030A0ZD4|5|Another reviewer noted a scene that was cut due to content, I wouldn't have remembered it if they hadn't told me:( But other than that the picture looks as good as it possibly can, only a few times does it show it's age. Overall this is an interesting video, with lots of great performances, some videos and humor thrown in. If you like Michael Jackson this is a must have, if you are a fan of 80s music/videos you would definitely be pleased as well.
B008HK3XU4|2|upside down design for fire hd or it needs an opening for the charger so the cover can be shut while charging<br />BUT that is the only flaw in it but it is a big inconvenience
B009UX2YAC|5|Me and my friend say this is a great game we love it
031236198X|5|This bok is a quick read, probably less than an hour.  The book talks about how to recognize when change is needed, and how to manage a group through the process of change, but does it in a fun way.  The book is a fable, the story of a group of penguins who discover that the iceberg they live on is melting, and have to figure out what (if anything) to do about it.      While it sounds silly, and does contain some humor, sometimes a simple story can convey many important lessons.  This is one of those times.  In reading the story, I kept thinking back to teams I'd worked on, and seeing similarities between particular colleagues and particular penguins.    As the authors point out at the end, much of the power of this story is in it's simplicity.  By stripping it down to the essential details, it's much easier to follow the process.  They also point out that if a group of people are all familiar with the story, it gives them a common language to use when dealing with these issues.
B009GEBBNQ|5|I enjoy this movie. The only it said for 2 days but I only had it for 1 day. Eve
B00HBR9OWU|2|I like the game but I cant get any corn or other items to proceed in the game..
B0098VYCCE|4|I gave this movie 4 stars cause it was much better than what I thought it would be. Kristen Stewart is sexy.
B00KMX5V8G|4|Very fun and challenging game.
0670023329|5|This book is wonderful!!!  I hope it becomes a movie.. it's almost described as the Hunger games without the \\"games\\".  The West has no idea what atrocities are being committed in North Korea.  I could not stop listening to the book.  I cried many times during this book.  Everyone needs to read or listen to this book so we can have the world make this terrible dictatorship known.  This is far worse than any information that is being taught in our schools.  Everyone needs to be aware and understand this terrible regime and start condemning  the US's current lax policy towards N. Korea.
B00FR88VTC|3|I thought u would be able to really scan things ,but you cant.you take pics of things..
B00005UQ9F|5|Ah, fresh air.  This disturbing little gem kept my wife up all night with the lights on and in the morning she pleaded with me not to go to work until the sun rose.  It's always nice to see originality at work, even when it scares the bjesus out of you.  This film is not for those who thought that \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" was scary when the baddie, a winged doofus, was whistling \\"Jeepers Creepers.\\"  This is a movie for those who saw the true cleverness of \\"The blair witch project.\\"  Although distinctly different than Blair Witch, Session 9 gives you the same feeling of an eerie dread that sticks with you days after first viewing.  The DVD makes a welcome addition to a serious film fan's collection with some cool extras.  The deleted scenes offer an interesting and creepy sub-plot not explored in the final cut.  The alternate ending is not as bone-chilling as the one left in the movie but if you like extras this disk provides an interesting perspective.  Great plot, methodical pacing, and plenty of chills(gore hounds beware, this is a psycological horror movie-splatter lacking), make this movie one great view, just be sure to watch it late at night.
B00AIQP9DE|5|Fun app great graphics which I've found to be the same for all this brands apps, they always give you fun story lines too.
B000007ODM|5|I bought this to replace the one I gave away as I found I could not live with out it!
B00B7Y0206|5|Best you tube
B00QLVY7J2|5|love this game, however I think it should be explained more clearly that you need to build everything as you collect all the blue men and and that you play cards at your own risk.  if you have to repeat a card you have to pay again.  would be nice to get 2 chances to play for what you pay in resources
B0031KE9C6|5|I really enjoy watching this little girl wonder.  What case can she not solve?
0060899190|5|This is so intriguing.  I use it as a coffee table book.  It is so interesting trying to figure out what is going on in peoples' lives.
B0088P2A7A|5|This app provides a clean and clear way to use wikipedia on kindle fire.  Each page loads quickly and the reader is able to easily sort information on every page.
B00HV8TN7K|2|Slow , had nice nap. Ending was teribble
0143124544|3|Great book. A little on the sad side, but many lessons in life tucked into each chapter.
B00BAXFCPO|5|David Perlmutter is on to something that we all should be looking at to change our diets and improve our health.
B00I2TV3NO|5|Great movie
