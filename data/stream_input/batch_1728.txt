B0018O4YSQ|4.0|Science fiction set in an alien created alternate reality floating in space. Great special effects and decent story line. Bongeriffic!
B00005YAMV|4.0|Dylan is great and all, but I really just bought this for the cover image. It spoke to me more than the lyrics, and Dylan's lyrics are the best thing about his music.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Typical Ridley Scott with superior special effects. This story lends to the Alien series by establishing the origins of the beasty and leaves an opening for another story.
B001CP4VM0|5.0|The stories are varied, and it's normal with different directors and different visions. But they are all compelling and moving, more so than I got from the disappointing Reloaded and Revolutions.
B00361R2VU|1.0|This is the least frightening movie I have seen in a long time. It starts out terribly slow, the characters are dull and have terrible ideas, and there's not enough spooky stuff going on.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|You can't go wrong with this one. The West Wing is a TV show unlike any other. It's in the Top 5 of best shows ever made, and rightly so.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game entertained us both! It was easy for her and didn't take long for her to catch on, plus the difficult levels were challenging. So I didn't feel like it was another useless kid app taking up memory!
0671004107|3.0|I was a big fan of the movie and wanted Carl to expand the world even further. However, it makes for dull and difficult reading. It takes a while to get into it, but it warms up in the end. I guess I like it spoon-fed to me in visual form.
B001FD5KJM|4.0|Product came as advertised. Not sure what I'm supposed to say, its a video of a movie.  Just using up space here.
B000NQR8TM|5.0|I don't buy music. I download it illegally most of the time. But sometimes, when the music is this good, you have to have it in your collection. This is one of those times.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love love love im never getting anything done now!! downloaded with no problem and well worth the money! :) enjoy folks!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Loved the book, loved the series.  I used to not read a great deal of non-fiction; however, with series like this one, it is hard to stop reading. Well worth it!
B00992CF6W|2.0|MORE GAMEPLAY UPDATES NEEDED! this game has great potential, the only thing you can do in this pocket version is dig and build buildings. the crafting table can be put in game but you cant craft anything...WTF is up with that. as of now this game is NOT worth the $$.
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read, but haven't decided if better than \\"50 Shades\\" yet. Maybe once get into next book I can decide ...
B009AZZEU2|5.0|For those expecting another Louder Than Love or Badmotorfinger might be disappointed. But for those who immensely enjoyed Superunknown and Down on the Upside you will find that King Animal has the trippy experimentation of Down on the Upside with the focus and strike of Superunknown and even manages to do some new stuff too. \\"Non-State Actor\\" combines the might of Led Zeppelin with the grove of Fugazi, \\"By Crooked Steps\\" is surprisingly heavy and frightening, \\"A Thousand Days Before\\" is a rolling psychedelic masterpiece, \\"Birds of Bones\\" creeps along like \\"The Day I Tried to Live\\", \\"Black Saturday\\" recalls \\"Burden In My Hand\\" while throwing in a weird bridge, but the real treasures come from the last three tracks: The erratic \\"Worse Dreams\\", the smokin' \\"Eyelid's Mouth\\", and last but certainly not least, the epic chain-gang mantra of \\"Rowing\\" that somewhat resembles \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" in structure. There is one or two filler tracks (one of them being the out of place Cornell solo sounding song \\"Halfway There\\") but there's plenty of classic Soundgarden songs to be had. I can safely call this the best Soundgarden album since Superunknown.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book took you right to where the first one left you hanging.  Great details in the book, but again the book left you hanging at the end.  But I was ready with the last book of the series.  Great read!!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|it was not as good a movie as what it looked like on the previews. pretty hard to come up with enough words for your requirments
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the book.  The series up to this book just kept me wanting to know more.  This was a great read, but the end was terrible.  I wanted more detail, not just a quick this is what happendend and done.
B001V5CIHQ|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this as I am a die hard fan of the Disney Cartoon but my six year old son had never heard the story of Peter Pan and when I showed him the preview for the cartoon and then this one he was way more interested in the \\"movie\\" version.  (Only little kids watch cartoons) So we watched this.  He loved it.  I must say it was very well done, kept to the original story but was really fun to watch it in a real setting instead of a cartoon.  I still love the original cartoon but I would watch this again!!
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie but was very disappointed. The storyline was weak and boring. Save your time and money!
B0083JCCX8|5.0|After all the.<br />hype over this series, I was expecting to be disappointed. Thankfully, I wasn't and found to be a rather engaging read. I liked the characters, especially Katniss and thought the whole reality Tv show take on things was rather unique. Simply cannot wait to read the next one.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|This album is fantastic!  It's a great mix of dance music and some more melancholy but equally beautiful tracks.  I also love that this edition includes the Calvin Harris track \\"I Need Your Love\\".
B006LSZECO|1.0|I should have believed a lot of the reviews before I purchased this book. It kept me glued to the pages for a day and a half until the end. Yeah I feel very cheated. VERY disappointed and sorry I wasted my money.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|As with many prolific authors, Cornwell is beginning to lose steam.  I found the plot<br />interesting, but with many gaps and lack of logic.  Too many holes.  However, her<br />characters continue to fascinate and are well developedk,
B009LA1QW6|4.0|Earlier in 2012, Lana Del Rey released BORN TO DIE -- it was her breakthrough into the mainstream consciousness, and it was met with wildly mixed opinions.  I was a late comer to the album, but I loved it the first time I listened to it.  I was cautiously optimistic about her follow up to BORN TO DIE, an 8-song EP called PARADISE.  On one hand, I was excited to hear more music from Del Rey, but on the other hand, I was worried that 10 months wasn't really long enough for Del Rey and her producers to come through with a quality release.  After listening to the EP several times, I can say that I really dig PARADISE, but it doesn't quite live up to the past release.<br /><br />The EP begins with \\"Ride,\\" one of the highlights of the album.  The song features many of the hallmarks of Del Rey's sound: loungy vocals with slight reverb, layered instrumentation, dark and confused lyrics.  The song varies between slower and faster tempos: it makes for a good single and a good indication of where the album is going to go.  \\"Ride\\" is followed up with \\"American,\\" whose orchestration is met with electronic percussion.  The other album highlight also comes early: \\"Cola,\\" a vulgar song with a killer melody.  The good news is that the first three songs on this EP are great, but the bad news is that it's a bit downhill from there.  The rest of the EP isn't bad, most of it is quite good, but it never quite reaches the same early heights.  One of the first songs released for the album was the cover of the classic song \\"Blue Velvet.\\"  Instead of Del Rey and her producers giving the song their own spin, it remains a pretty faithful adaptation -- the only marked difference is Del Rey's vocals.  It strikes me as a missed opportunities of sorts -- it's a good song, and I would have liked to see what Lana Del Rey could do with it with more creative license.  The final track, \\"Bel Air,\\" is a breathy and atmospheric tune.  For Del Rey, whose compositions are usually pretty busy, it's a relatively stripped down song.  The song ends PARADISE on a great note.<br /><br />I will reiterate: PARADISE isn't bad by any means.  It sags a bit in the middle, and at its best, it's on par with BORN TO DIE.  Listener who didn't enjoy BORN TO DIE most likely will not be persuaded by the music here.  Fans who did enjoy Del Rey's past work will find PARADISE a great diversion and a great appetizer for her next album.  I haven't heard any news of a new album, so hopefully this isn't actually the dessert.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"Cola,\\" \\"Ride,\\" \\"American.\\"<br /><br />ADDITIONAL RELEASE INFORMATION:  The bonus track: \\"Burning Desire\\" is available on iTunes.  It's pretty great, and I would recommend fans go check it out.  Another version of this EP acts as an extended version of BORN TO DIE.

B0042J6VUS|4.0|This is a handy little tripod for the smart phone. Just a bit light in weight, but so is a phone, and it is compact. The head is detachable, so if the legs prove to be too light, you can mount the head on a more substantial set of legs.<br />Lightweight, compact. Good product.

030758836X|5.0|It was interesting to me that so many reviewers thought the ending was disappointing/terrible/a rip off/absurd/hateful/etc.,etc.  It's not required for a story to always end in a pleasant way or that the guy and girl ride off on a white horse to live happily ever after.  It ended in the perfect way for two souls as sick as Amy and Nick.  Each of them gets exactly what she/he deserves.  What could be better?  Marvelous story and very well written with great insight as to who we are and why we're that way.

B009KYXEY6|5.0|Filled with dazzling vocals, amazing instrumentals and images of Coney Island, Paradise manages to thrust Del Rey into the U.S. spotlight after several ignored her after her SNL performance. Dispite harsh reviews and critics for her original \\"Born to Die\\" attempt, Del Rey does not give up as she maintains her Gangsta Nancy Sinatra persona and dazzling/husky vocals throughout this album. This may be the second noticable re-issue of an album along with Katy Perry's \\"Teenage Dream - The Complete Confection\\", but Miss Lana allows for her listeners the option of wanting the old tracks or just the new ones with her EP \\"Paradise\\" and unlike Katy Perry, she packs many more tracks onto this re-release. There's no doubt Lana Del Rey is inspired by Britney Spears because Del Rey (with incredible references to old school Americana) will become America's little darling by giving us all a little piece of PARADISE.

B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I've had this for a while now and have tried a number of times to get it balanced with my 7D. Even though it's within the weight range, I think it's too heavy for it. There are a number of adjustment, but no real documentation on how to properly balance it. Most adjustments seem straight forward, except for the lower arm with the weights on it. Raising and lowering it does seem to change things, but without any real documentation, it's just guess work.<br />With my 7D and 24-105 L lens on it, it seems a lot harder to even get close to balanced than the 7D and the nifty-fifty, lightweight 50mm lens. With the 50mm, it seems I can *almost* get it balanced, so I'm guessing a lighter camera *might* work better, but I can't confirm this.<br />One of the biggest issues I have with it, is when you are close to having it balanced, it can suddenly be waaaay off again.  I think it may be because there is a lot of play in the lower arm, and no way to tighten it up.<br /><br />To sum up, if you have a camera setup lighter than a 7d, this *might* be worth a try, but make sure you play with it enough to know for sure before its too late to return it.  If you have a 7D or heavier, I'd wouldn't recommend this, even though it's within the weight limit.<br /><br />I gave it two stars rather than one since it *might* work with a lighter setup.<br /><br />Richard.

1432794426|5.0|Dr. Moriarty thank you for giving Michael Jackson fans something beautiful and substantial...just like the man himself... that shows him to be what his fans have always believed...an incredibly talented human being blessed with many gifts...and yes also flaws as all of us possess. Of course the Worlds Greatest Entertainer/King Of Pop images, sounds and moves will be ingrained into our culture and our lives forever...but you have also given us the very human, sometimes surprisingly ordinary side to this global humanitarian...who gave so much more of himself that we will ever know.<br /><br />Dr. Moriartys book takes you on a journey through his life...always with L.O.V.E. as she reaffirms his passion and commitment to his craft, his fans, his humanitarian work, the children of the world, thousands who are now adults and have the gift of life because of this one man who cared enough. He gave away over half his fortune in his life time..much of which the public/media never knew about. All he knew was that little boy needed a liver transplant, or he would die...that orphanages and hospitals around the world needed a  piece of medical equipment that would save children...that parents who lost a child and had no money recieved help from Michael Jackson for a proper burial.<br />He was more than a singer and dancer to these people he was a hero.<br /><br /> Michael didn't have many living hero's especially in the last 10 years of his life, and one of these I would like to mention in my review because he also approved of and loved Dr. Moriarty's book was Thomas Mesereau...This man is my hero and he was Michaels hero..during the 2005 trial this man was a gift from God placed by Michaels side as a light during his darkest hour....I believe he kept him sane...moving forward...I believe he saved his life and gifted the world with four more years of this remarkable man.<br /><br /> Michael was many things to us... The King of Music and Dance bar none! ... He was beautiful everyday of his life. But the important thing that set him apart was his heart, the giving and compassion that poured from inside him like unstoppable lava that never once burned anyone else along the way no matter what was being said about him.  I often wonder what glorious works from the mind of this genius prophet the world has lost. Thank you, Dr. Moriarty for your love and understanding, and for your amazing gift you have given the world...If you are a fan read it...and then read it again...use it as a tool for education for those that don't understand Michael the man...the father...the most caring human being of our generation....for non fans  please take the time to read it at least once....you will come away changed...hopefully with a new and softer perspective of this man who was destined to be King.<br /><br />Michael, we miss you, and will always love you most!

B004J4WLB4|4.0|This book isn't one I'd typically read but I'm very glad I did. I felt each characters struggle and felt like I was there.
1616960922|4.0|Brandon Sanderson once again created a world that is both fantastical and believable at the same time.  Like many of his novels it contains a unique magic system, interesting characters and a gripping story.  Unlike his other works, this one is short.  Extremely short.  Now don't get me wrong, I knew it was a novella, but the price tag to length ratio is the only reason it earned 4 stars instead of 5.
B0084IG7KC|4.0|Why was that myth created?<br /><br />What is the legacy of that myth?<br /><br />Why do the rich and powerful continue to perpetuate that myth?<br /><br />What is the future of that myth if humanity does not extinguish it once and for all?<br /><br />I was astounded how much better this film was than I expected.  I also had no idea the books dealt with such a deep and important subject matter.  You do not need to know who Malthus even was or what horrors have been wrought in the world in his name to get the point of this movie.  You will get enough taste of it without needing any background.  You will probably want to know more afterwards, though.<br /><br />I am still reducing the rating by a star because the pacing of the ending is off for some reason.  The climax just doesn't quite feel climactic to me.  I also never really felt there was any chance the protagonist wouldn't make it.  Otherwise, I think this film is worth checking out.
B004U8VWIM|2.0|I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but I don't get it.  Yes, the acting was good, but the story was not very engaging.  Once the movie was over I didn't really give the movie a second thought.  Very forgetable.
B005LAII3U|3.0|I was completely on-board this film for the first half.  Very engaging.  Suspenseful.  Len Wiseman also has far better taste in production design, costumes, and women than Paul Verhoeven.  That doesn't hurt.  The obvious visual influences did not bother me.  And I liked the concrete.  I'll admit, I did not get they were traveling through the center of the Earth with those \\"The Fall\\" transport machines.  I'm not sure I would have bought that if I'd caught onto it while watching.<br /><br />At about the half-way point, I started being not as entirely engaged in the characters as I could have been.  I'm not certain why that was.  My first hunch is that the opening scene convinced me the protagonist was already a super-spy and was a miscalculation in editing... or perhaps just the wrong scene to have used.  But that should have affected the first half, right?  Was it the robots?  I had a similar disconnect in I-Robot, too.  Hmm...  I still enjoyed this, but somewhere it lost me a little even when it held onto my attention.<br /><br />Looked amazing.  Action sequences I found to be very lucid and not overly frenetic.  And there are a few useful homages to the original film, including a neat little misdirect.  The score was good, too, but I heard hints of something better in there in the melodic layers and atmosphere that wasn't fully realized.  I felt the music had another level it could have achieved.  I was hearing the beginnings of a great score that just didn't quite pull off in the final pieces.<br /><br />Maybe the robots, combined with the less soaring musical moments, combined with a lack of really key beats in the actors' performances... a sort of lack of space and connecting that kept this film from being great.  Perhaps the characters just lacked depth that the subject matter & look of the film called for?  Come to think of it, both the female characters are rather 2D.  And I'm not sure the protagonist's vulnerability was fully fleshed out.  Just a thought.<br /><br />I went in looking for a deep sci-fi experience and all I got was a well-executed, visually-breathtaking action movie.  Not bad, but I felt it could have been something more.  Could it be... Schwarzenegger is a better actor than we give him credit for?  Or Verhoeven a true actors' director?  Those possibilities are blowing my mind right now./><br />I went in looking for a deep sci-fi experience and all I got was a well-executed, visually-breathtaking action movie.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another cliff hanger for Grisham.  Full of red herrings.  Grisham still has it.  Glad to see that he hasn't gone Clancy's way with ghost writers!
B004SEUJAA|5.0|I highly recommend this film. Maybe It is a man's film but is more than meets the eye, is also a time machine and a history lesson.<br />Peter Weir demonstrates that is a great director all the way. Russel Crowe, Paul Bettany and all the cast are superb. An epic with strong characters, beautifiul landscapes and yes amazing realistic battles ar sea!!!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Had a great time playing this game right after I downloaded it. Opening it up the day after, however,  it froze on me in no more than 5 min. I have no problem with the general playability of the game, and have not needed to purchase anything, nor will I,  but the freezing makes it impossible. Please fix.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Another good story.  And I laughed at all the humor in the first few chapters, but by the middle and end of book he was really stretching for the jokes and it got kind of old.  That aside I enjoyed it and will buy his next book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Wonderful App helped me every night with my homework! :) Thanks so much guys for creating this its a wonderful app everyone buy it right now!!!!!!!!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I am loving this series. I'm an avid fantasy reader (RA Salvatore, Gale Z. Martin etc) and was very happy with this purchase.  I highly recommend it if you love action and tales of unspeakable evil!
B00003CXCQ|2.0|It only plays on one of our 4 DVD players! Very irritating. We love snow white, but sucks that it only works on one player
B000025KNI|5.0|Emergency on Planet Earth is Jamiroquai's excellent debut album.  I have loved it since I first heard it when I was in the eighth grade, and now at 31 years old it still features on my playlists. Their early work sounds just as developed and sophisticated as their other albums, which I own as well. I especially love the track \\"too young to die.\\"
B004EWGLKI|5.0|This was the first book by David that I ever read. I frightened a lot of people in airports by laughing till I cried when I read it. It is hilarious. I've now read all David's books. Classic stuff. Great writing.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The newest John Grisham book, The Racketeer, is my favorite in a long while.  I'm a huge fan, from waaay back. I've not been impressed with his books of late but The Racketeer brings me back to the storytelling I grew to love. I found intelligence, the push to think, interesting twists, and a satisfying ending.  For a while, I was fearful the ending would be like one of my other fav books, The Partner, and leave me sad for the main character.<br />Thanks, John Grisham, for bringing it home!
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I liked this book to probably read it a second time, but with more caution than the first time I read it in knowing what the ending is like.  I found it somewhat implausible that this outcast kid would find a \\"home\\" with a group of much older teenagers than himself, and even date one of them; especially because he was more or less a bumbling fool who occasionally said insightful things but mostly seemed like a zombie who cried too much.<br /><br />That said, I recommend it, but not if you are looking for a standard happy ending.  I was somewhat depressed and unsettled when I finished it.  I don't want to say more lest I give away key plot points, but I felt like it cut off rather abruptly and left me with questions.
B004D2A04M|4.0|The only reason why I give this clip 4 stars is because of its difficulty in removing or inserting the light easily. My Fenix PD32 is hard to put in the clip. However I believe the intended purpose of this clip is to keep the flashlight in the clip and \\"shoot from the hip\\" so to speak. I don't need it for that purpose.  It's a well made clip and will definitely hold your light securely.
B008SVS0K0|3.0|Still chasing the feelings I had from their first 2 records. This is a better step in the right direction then III though.
B000005Z0E|3.0|As tupac's first album it is well put together. You can tell the times of which it was written in if you pay attention. The album touchs more of a political and black power base then tupac's later music. Over all good album, great for adding to the collection.
B001EYU1VO|1.0|Had only six months. Light use.Maybe 10 hours a week, at best.<br />Early on, button number 2 came off.<br />Now, right rudder pulls right at rest position, and does not let other buttons work, unless I correct by twisting stick to the left.<br />Button number 11 sticks also.<br />Since others reported same problems, felt I should also... be warned.<br /> When flying flight sim, have to fight right rudder constantly.
B005PK553C|5.0|I don't know how I didn't know about this show when it was on.  Love it!  Can't wait to start watching season 2!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As expected this is one great CD love the piano guys doesn't get any better than this, can't wait till the next one is out.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Informative, easy to use Interface, packed<br />with great ideas!<br />Tried recipes are a plus and are accurate!<br />Some simple and affordable Home Remedies!<br />Great ideas for landscaping and DIY projects!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Pretty decent storyline in this period thriller, a few surprising twists to the plot. Over all an enjoyable movie. Would recommend when you're just looking for some entertainment.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|Althought it was smaller that it looks like but actually it great one<br />I would recommend for anyone for sure
B009FZFONO|5.0|From the make-up to costumes to superb acting ability, this raw creation will leave a lasting impression. At the end of each episode, my man & I realize that we've held our breath through 95% of it. Gripping, unique, thrilling, and oh-so-suspenseful. Thank you, thank you, thank you AMC for putting such a kick ass series out for the general populous, not just that geeky comic reading subculture who obsesses about the zombie apocalypse. No offense (unless of course you're 30 years old and still living in your mother's basement).<br /><br />If you haven't experienced The Walking Dead yet, you're missing out!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I've buyed this pack because of an idea of my friends, of haivng a &#34;Matrix Marathon&#34;, but we ended watching all of the discs inside.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This incredible addicting game has become even better on Android. The great graphics and animations look spectacular on my Kindle Fire. Gameplay is simple and intuitive, but keeps me coming back time and time again. This is the full game, and there are no annoying advertisements to take away from the experience. I highly recommend picking up this casual gaming joy. Great work to the development team as well.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|A great movie... A little slow at the beggining, while all the stories gather, but excellent effects and action scenes
B0015DWJX2|5.0|A nice stroll through the little known history of Guernsey Island during & immediately after World War II based on truth.  The story unfolds through letters written by a variety of characters.  Great story for book lovers as it's based on a book club formed as a way for the islanders to meet during the German occupation.
B007SSEU9O|4.0|Worth watching even if you are not a fan of Reagan and Thatcher. Meryl Streep is convincing in subtle ways.  The story at first hints at, and then later clarifies the basis of her very conservative political philosophy which in the film is attributed to helping Brittan out of a severe economic recession.
B000002P74|5.0|This an outstanding record by one of best of their time. Sweet Home Alabama is the top track but there are all right up there with that track. If you have never heard the whole album, you owe it to yourself to give it a listen. If it's been a long time since you have heard it, then you have forgotten how good it really is!
B0083Z614S|4.0|The Secret Garden is a delightful story about the power of positive thinking. It is an easy read and, at first glance, one might think it a book for children, which it is. However, if you are looking for the deeper meaning it is easy to see how the influence of a poor maid in a rich household on the thinking of a spoiled child can have far-reaching results, changing the lives of all she encounters. It is a magical book with a great message and a lovely story. I would recommend it highly for young and old alike. If you haven't read it for a while, it is a good re-read!
B0007GADZO|5.0|This is Mr Via at one of his finest moments. I love every song on this album. And despite some reviews I have read elsewhere, I like Steve's singing. Outstanding song that he sings on is &#34;Secrets.&#34;<br /><br /> The opening track is heavy. Steve's playing is as always top notch and over the top with the right amount of class thrown in!!
B0038AUY96|5.0|This was the first Jo nesbo book I have read after a lot of other readers told me to give it ago, l was not disappointed  this is an really good read , lots of twists. and turns a real page Turner l look forward to reading more by Jo nesbo in the future
B008AWBQGM|5.0|Reminds me of the old band. These guys are still cranking out some real good stuff. Singer has found his own unique voice. Not trying to be or sound like his brother. I really like this album. I got the special edition with the extra tracks. Worth the extra.
B008G59IKO|4.0|Here we are at album two and this one is an album of two halves - one good, one not quite as inspired. The first half of Dos is excellent while the last half is not as consistant but contains some nice tracks. Like Uno, is fails to hold up in the second half, but it's a much better album than it's predecessor. Sadly though, it will no doubt sell less copies and not receive the wide-spread praise it deserves.<br />Similarly to Uno, it's a very Nimrod-ish sounding album but without the variety that Nimrod had - which in itself was good and bad.<br />The major difference between Dos and Uno though is that I like Dos.<br />I've listened to this album more in the past week than I have for the past two months with Uno. Though this album has made me revisit Uno and I'm giving it more listens.<br />After a week or so I found Uno to be boring and haven't really listened to any of it for the past month. The longevity of this one should be a bit better as it has a handful of instant classics. It's good songs are better than Uno's gooduns and there are more of them, however it has a couple of sub-par ones. There was nothing overly bad on Uno, it was pretty consistent, with limited filler. Dos has Nightlife to drag it down and is an album of more extremes - ie more highs and bigger lows. Versus Uno, Dos certainly has more songs that would make it onto one great album.<br />Lots of songs here have a familiar ring to them.<br /><br />B-  -See You Tonight is a nice opener. Kind of Song of the Century-ish. I like my one minute acoustics.<br />B  -F$%& Time is a fun track though maybe a tad childish for aging rockers<br />B+  -Stop When The Red Lights Flash is a highlight<br />A-  -Lazy Bones is another highlight and the best track on offer. Love this one though it reminds me a bit of Del Shannon's Runaway<br />B+  -Wild One keeps the quality high<br />C+  -Makeout Party falters a bit but rates as good filler<br />B  -Stray Heart is a good track. Not a classic first single but catchyenough. So we're halfway and things are looking very good. Can Dos be better than Uno?<br />C  -Ashley, however, is where things take a turn and the quality drops. Nothing much to like about this one. Filler.<br />C+  -Baby Eyes is an OK track though. Nimrod-ish but nothing spectacular.<br />C+  -Lady Cobra - same as the Baby Eyes comment<br />C-  -Nightlife ummm, no thank you. Billie sounds like he has a head cold and that's not the worst part of this awful track. It could have been good without the external input.<br />B-  -Wow! That's Loud has grown on me. So much so I've edited my first review to bump up it's rating from a C. Perhaps too much uninspiring instrumentalism to push it up to a flat B<br />B+  -Amy is a nice track. An instant liker. It screams familiarity though. Something from the 60's that I can't quite place.<br /><br />By the end of Tre, one great album of material looks the likely outcome and perhaps what should have been released. Dos tracks should fill many of those spots. But they'll manage to get more than twice the amount of money out of me from the three albums so mission accomplished guys.<br />My hope was for Dos to be far better than Uno and whilst it IS much better it's not a stand-alone classic Green Day album - but my hopes for Tre are still high.<br />Add the four great tracks from Uno to the six from Dos and hopefully Tre will have at least six of quality and then you'll have yourself a ripper album.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Julia really has a good performance in this movie. Not really following the old story, but it's close enough with modern touches to make it really an enjoyable  view.
B0073XORCY|1.0|A longtime jethro tull fan but this thing is one of Ian's biggest mistakes. There are no songs to speak of, just words making little sense to me and set to bits of music that dont hold together, have nothig to do with thick as a brick, and are old and tired. Thrown together in a weekend<br />Sorry, but this album is severely hurting
B001AOKA3W|4.0|I rated the movie 4 stars because it avoided  horror movie cliches in favor of random mayhem.<br /><br />Having a big monster tramping through a city must be pretty confusing.  Where do you go? What are those little monster-thingies falling off him? What happens if you get scratched/bitten by one? How big a pack of jerks are the authorities going to be?<br /><br />All that came across in the movie.  Not great art, but not crud either.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|After all these years zz top can still rock the house. Despite a fairly low production values (it sounds like three guys in an empty studio) the songs are excellent, straight up heavy blues and rock.<br />The first two tracks are weird compositions and not even Beard can keep those songs on track but the remainder is hard hitting and very cool.<br />Loved it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|it's good but you can't blow up dynamite in creative and you can't place water whatsoever:( buy it only if you don't care about that stuff.
B009VB9VKY|3.0|It wasn't as great as all the hype.  Nothing I would have to watch again.  This is just my opinion, you might love it but I didn't
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like to play Mahjong and this app keeps me entertained<br />The ad's only seem to show up when you've completed a level and at the very beginning. It was free after all...
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show on TV!!!  Love it!  I never was a fan of zombies till now! Every program is loaded with scary moments and quirks!
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow is very entertaining and I look forward to each episode. Many, many moons ago, I was hooked on the Green Arrow comics and this is a winner for following the comic book style and action. The stunts are truly excellent and the star does many of his own. . . Amell is totally believable in this series! When you see him work out and do the stunts, it is impressive! WOW! The production crew is seasoned and has some excellent credentials with roots in Smallville, Supernatural etc.  I do not watch much television anymore, but this series totally puts action and some light drama back into my schedule! Way better than work!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another great read by Kate Morton!  Each new chapter reveals one more crumb on the trail to discovering the characters' secrets.  Try as you may, it will take most of the book to figure out what lies behind the facade of the main characters.  As most of us know, keeping secrets is never healthy, and they tend to destroy those lives left in the dark.  Ms. Morton is adept at keeping us in suspense, and wanting to spend every free minute reading this story in order to unravel all the secrets, as well as the motivation behind them.  I can assure you will not be able to figure out all the details until the very end of the book.  What would you have done in similar circumstances?  Food for thought....

B0027BOL4G|5.0|If you are a meat eater and does not want to give it up.  DO NOT watch this documentary. This documentary helps me to understand better what kind of meat that I am eating, where it orginally comes from, and how it is processed.  After I watched it, definitely, I have been eating less and less meat. I like this documentary.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book had a very slow beginning.  I couldn't seem to find a good flow in the book.  Finally at the end, I understood the book.  I stopped reading it a couple of times, but decided I need to finish it, and was rewarded with a wild twist.
0937381888|1.0|It was delivered today, the pages are all dirty and with inks spots (like a print leak)... lot of stains all over the book! It's unreadable... some pictures of it are attached. I asked amazon about a replacement and the answer was that they are running out stock.<br />the really ruined ones are: pages 189 to 191, 194 to 207 and 212 to 220.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent read.  In fact I read it twice, the twist in the story is totally unforeseen.  It is one of the best Kay Scarpetta<br />Books that I've read in a few years.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat right until the end!
B0058VW36U|4.0|it was really great and fun, 'till it got a new update. I'm not super patient, so sometimes I used the skip level. now that is gone, so I haven't been able to play half the app. I'm not happy about this whatsoever.<br />Unhappily,<br />TOF<br />Tween On Fire
B009NQKPUW|2.0|The best thing the movie has going for it is an interesting futuristic look. The script is awful.  I kept stopping the film to complain to my wife about the constant moronic choices the \\"scientists\\" and \\"explorers\\" were making. Don't waste your money!!!!
B000000OUE|5.0|Some great White Zombie songs on this album, and my favorite song, Blood Milk and Sky is on there. Also, I love the album artwork.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is a good way to kill time. I like playing it when I have nothing else to do or I'm in a waiting room or in line. Good times!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I did enjoy the book.  Two differences I noted in this book as compared to similar accounts.  Firstly, is the fact that the author was in a coma (dead to the world?) for over a week as compared to much briefer experiences from others.  Secondly, other than his guide (sister?), I did not understand what the author learned directly from the \\"core\\".  The \\"love\\" message was there, yet that message is common to most other \\"life after death\\" experiencers.<br /><br />I also felt the reader was provided an overload of the author's credentials. The reader is continuously reminded about the degrees, knowledge and professional background of the author, suggesting implicitly that this account might be the most valid of those to date.
B000ICXQXI|5.0|It had been a few years since I last saw Psycho, and I convinced my kids (14 and 18) to watch with me on Halloween. I loved it, they were lukewarm. As great as this movie is (imo), it may not grab the next generation.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|Great movie!! I can watch this over and over again (with at least a 3 month interval between viewings lol!) Will Smith is great as usual...
B00471TLZS|5.0|This is great child friendly sci-fi/horror film. Poltergeist is a truely classic series. A series for all generations to enjoy.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I love alien movies anyhow so this was a natural selection for me. The cast was great and the movie was fantastic. I will own this on DVD so that I can watch it again and again.
B004VFK5LO|3.0|This was an opportunity for the co-star but she really doesn't carry it off.  She was much better in a supporting role in The Firm.  Still Sigourney does well as a claustophobia \\"victim.\\"  Good psychological ending.
B0091REZMW|5.0|mystery manor I just started playing this game and haven't got to far in it but I like it. its a bit different from other hidden object game. try it its free if you don't like delete it up date I'm playing this game on my kindle HD rd. It works very good and you don't.have to pay for this. U can use your diamond to make friends. Their is a list of names. But u can't zoom in or out.. the object are place in different areas in the room you are in so it make it a little harder to find then. Their is a timer so you have to find all the object before time runs out.  I hope this help.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|It's a completely crazy adventure that will keep you wanting more. Yes it is like a Swedish Forrest Gump, but it is still a very fun read that will leave a smile on your face.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|This movie is one of the best of all times. It's nice to see a movie that focuses on care and compassion rather than sex and drugs
B000N2HCM4|5.0|Very detailed account into who Barack Obama really is in his words.  Not taken out of context by other authors.  It makes me understand his struggle growing up both black and white. I was amazed at his eloquence.  Well maybe not surprised.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Johnny Depp is fantastic as Barnabus Collins...really entertaining movie<br />Funny, suspenseful, all around fun movie for the whole family. I would recommend to anyone
B008OOYALE|4.0|A very fun and addictive game.  Lots of fun discovering new dragons.  You ned lots of patience though,as most tasks take time to complete.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|The Dr Who Sonic Screwdriver was a birthday present for my sixteen year old grandson.<br />He was very happy with it.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|A lot of my friends have pointed out that this movie teaches little girls that you can 'change an awful abusive man into the man of your dreams', to which I always respond 'Don't ruin my childhood you stinkin jerks' This movie is great! For the very very small group who hasn't seen it yet, then watch it! It's well worth it.
B008MZPVP4|3.0|This cd by down is ok. Its only a ep with six songs on it. If your looking for nola type music, its not here, however its not bad either,just ok.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very good app that is also,absolutely free.  It lets you check the weather for various areas, watch the most recent weather-televised forcasts/updates, and watch satellite views of your incoming weather for your area. Also, it has this cool tab that rates activities that you can do during the day, from low to high, depending on if the weather is suitable for the activity or not. All in all, I would definitely recommend this app, because its worth it!!!
B00913DPW2|4.0|It's almost like Mist. But it's a little easier. It has stump me a little and you have to unse the pieces in order as you fund them.
1582701709|2.0|I originally saw the film version of The Secret on netflix.  I thought the book would be an in depth analysis of the program.  I found it very simplisticly written and an actual carbon copy of the film.  The subject matter was very repetitive.  I expected a lot more.  Sorry.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is addicting!  I love it very fun and frustrating at times. But it has all the seasons and different.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app gives so many fun games that you can play for hours.  Its easy to earn the money to buy the locked games.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|Downloaded this app cause I use it to see some emails. But haven't used it all that much. But it works for me.
B003YUQAFM|5.0|I actually ordered these as a gift..bcause my sister gave the same pair to me and for Forida they are the perfect winter shoe.  You can wear them with sox for warmth if necessary.  They are the same comfort as all CROCS just in a deck shoe.  The size is tricky because they are unisex. I had to order a size 8w/6m instead of my regular 7w/5m.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|It's easier to download app then to have to go to search engines all the time. Plus it easier to get to.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|great film, dark, fun, great animation, FYI: every piece of clothing in this film was hand stitched by one person using needles thinner than a single strand of human hair.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|This book, The Little Prince, arrived in a very timely manner and was in just as good of condition as they described.  I would order from them again.
0345803507|5.0|Loved every single book to this series.  Steamy and good read.  I definitely would recommend this to anyone who likes a little naughtiness and love story.  Cannot wait for the movie!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I cant remember a show that was this good. The characters evolve, since the beginning of the series, in a way that will always keep you guessing. Some changes are for the good, some are for the bad, but youll never see it coming. This is a much darker season than the last 2. The individuals decisions are coming to fruition. Whether they see that the decisions yielded the outcome or not, remains to be seen. My only problem is that the episodes are too short, lol.
0345803493|5.0|First of all, receiving book2 and book3 in such a speedy manner was perfect. I was just finishing book1. Second of all, it's just a definite must read love story.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|ALWAYS ENTERTAINING, THE JOHN COREY CHARACTER IS AT THE TOP OF HIS GAME, WISECRACKING HIS WAY THROUGH ANOTHER ADVENTURE WITH HIS FBI WIFE. NOT MY FAVORITE DE MILLE STORY, BUT STILL A SOLID 4 STAR.
B0085OEU1I|4.0|This movie version of one of the best stage musicals of all time does a very good job translating this for the cinema.  Johnny Depp is very intriguing by his characterization and Tim Burton's large eyed characters and pale skinned style fits the original creator Stephen Sondheim's stage style perfectly.  The use of modern cinema stars does a wonderful job of expanding the appeal of this story to the modern movie goer.<br /><br />The orchestration is very good and true to the original music but many of the original songs are played rather than sung and this may be disappointing to the Broadway Musical buffs.  The singing is good for the most part but the person who plays the character of Mrs. Lovett is at times flat with her singing that may wear on your musical ears.  Mrs. Lovett's acting and macabre look fits the part very well and is a perfect match to Tim Burton's regular character selection.<br /><br />Overall this movie version is darker and more violent than the Broadway Stage version but fits to what movie goers are looking for today.  I would encourage anyone who enjoys this movie version to seek out the recorded stage version of the Broadway Musical with Angela Landsbury.  If they watch this stage version with an open mind, I believe they would gain even more enjoyment for the Musical Sweeney Todd.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Loved this book. Fast-paced, lots of action plus intriguing storyline. Ranks right up there with Jordan, Martin and Sanderson in my opinion.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book and learned a lot about Yemen and the situation with Al Qaida there.  It was my first John Corey book, and I will definitely read more books by this author.  Donnie
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Really like this cover. It folds to make a stand, love the color and inside and it has a strap on the outside to hold papers, etc
B001JFZ118|5.0|Connor MacLeod is a Scottish warrior. One day he is mortally wounded in battle. For some reason he doesn't die. He is cast out of his village and has to start a new life. After some time he meets a man who tells him that they are both immortals. The immortals battle each other for power. When an immortal kills another the winner gains the losers power. Whether he likes it or not, MacLeod must stay in hiding if he does not wish to fight. Forever is a long time and he will have to eventually.<br /><br />This is a classic movie. The Highlander has been rehashed and been cheapened over and over. This is the original and definitely the best. Christopher Lambert and Sean Connery do a great job. They make a great team. This is an excellent movie and everyone should see it.
B005HS4CUY|3.0|Please note that this set only comes with the Blu-ray 3D version of the films. If you are looking to buy it to get regular Blu-ray, DVD and/or Digital Copy versions of the films, you will be disappointed. Many of the customer reviews listed below are actually for the set that DOES include the BD/DVD/Digital Copy version of each film and not this one. If you are simply looking to get the 3D versions of these films, this is your ticket.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Chihiro stumbles onto an abandoned theme park while on vacation with her parents. The place is actually a bath house for spirits. Chihiro's parents have been turned into pigs and Chihiro must fend for herself. She has to figure out how to survive and save her parents. She grows attached to the place and must decide whether to go home or to stay in the spirit world.<br /><br />This was the first Miyazaki movie I saw. I blew my mind. The story is fantastical and ngrossing. There are many wonderful characters and amazing animation. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also great. This movie seeps you away into another world that you may not want to return from. I have heard news that a sequel is in the works. But if you haven't seen the original Spirited Away you are missing out on an anime legend.
B0098HJ11U|5.0|I love this CD. I have several by Bettye LaVette and I'm enjoying this one as much as the others.  She puts so much feeling into her singing, you can feel the emotion. The accompaniment is great also.
B000RJO578|5.0|Nicholas Angel is an excellent big city cop. He is sent to a small village by the superiors that he's making look bad. He soon discovers something is off in the small town he's now a part of. Sgt. Angel and his new partner must solve all of the mysterious murders that are plaguing the village. I didn't know solving a string of murders could be so funny.<br /><br />This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It's up there with The Big Lebowski and Super Troopers. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are hilarious. The amount of comedy in this movie is ridiculous. These guys are great. You must see this movie as soon as possible.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I think this game is great! you can get caught up and spend $$$ but its a really entertaining hidden object game.
B00003CXBK|5.0|While protecting his village from a demon-god Ashitaka is inflicted with a curse that will soon take his life. He then goes on a journey to find a cure. He meets a girl raised by wolves. He soon becomes involved in a war between the mountain gods and the people of a nearby town. He falls in love with the wolf princess, and decides to share her fate. Whatever it may be.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film. The animation, story, voice actors, and score are all incredible. This movie leaves an everlasting impression. There is simply no way to describe its greatness. You just have to watch it to understand.
0743270754|5.0|Thanks. I couldn't have asked for more. I got it when I needed it and it was at a great price.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|The young boy named Sosuke brings home a goldfish that he names Ponyo. Ponyo is a magical fish that has decided to live with Sosuke and his family. Ponyo's decision to leave the ocean has caused a magical spell to fail. Her absence has put the entire world in danger. Together Sosuke and Ponyo must save the world.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie. I am not a big fan of it for two reasons though. The animation was a little strange, and it seemed to be geared more toward children. I will not say anything bad about Ponyo though. It's incredible. A movie you can watch with the entire family. Despite my personal preference, I have to recommend it b/c it truly is great.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very interesting book and well written.Although I enjoyed book one more than book three. I will recommend the three books to be read.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|The Noctua NF-A4x10 FLX fan is certainly specialized but I bet if you look around you'll see they're more common than you think. The fan itself works very well and of course it's well made, as it is Noctua after all. What really sets this fan apart though, I think, is what's included with it, everything you need to replace that old or dying fan you might have. Noctua has included a kit that works very well and easily let's you use any type of connector you might come across with the fan.<br /><br />If you're looking for a high quality and quiet fan then check out these new specialized ones from Noctua. They also have them in 92mm and 60mm sizes, so one of them should fit your needs I'm sure.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />+Small and thin<br />+Quiet<br />+Includes adapters<br />+Lots of extras included<br />+Simple installation<br />+Inexpensive<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-None really
B003Y2BMVC|4.0|I didn't really have any opinion on the movie before I actually started watching it but it suprisingly drew me in. Treasure Island was a book that I loved reading over and over as a child and this movie just brought back that feeling of adventure and suspense and exotic locales.  The animation was very well done and the story pretty well crafted with enough surprises that it kept you engaged.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys animated movies as well as kids of all ages.
B001RCD2DW|3.0|Update 11-26-12<br /><br />Hfi580's and DT990's have had substantial burn in and the DT990's are amazing. Usable extension to subharmonic frequencies and on par with the akg's with the detail they manage. The Low frequency detail from the dt990's is superb, much more abundant bass than the K702's and more extension. The K702 soundstage is in another league than the dt990's but the 990's frequency response and output make short work of the 702's. I can still hear the wood wind players take their breath and hear the pick as it releases the guitar strings, but i had to add 3db @ 500 4dB @ 800 and 3dB @ 1K to pull the recessed mids out at first, but after some burn in the treble (5Khz+) calmed down to be silky smooth and in no way harsh or to prevalent.  After 30 hours I was ablr to cut the eq needed in half and now the dt990's sound so good its hard to take them off. For the price, they are simply spectacular. The HFI-580's on the other hand turned into a gift for the wife to listen to her kindle on.....<br /><br />*update* 11-20-12<br />After more burn in, the left can warmed up to a totally different sound stage and freq response than the right, I thought maybe it was an issue with my source, confirmed it was not, turned my attention to my bellari ha540, tryed an old pair of sony's I had laying around and both channels were even and clear as a bell, thinking it may still be the bellari somehow, I picked up a Bravo V2, same thing... Thought well maybe its my luck and the tubes arent up to par to run the 702's so I rolled tubes on both amps and still the same thing. My last effort to verify the phones were the issue was to pick up an Audioengine D1... It was the cans. They were scheduled to be sent back today and I have the hfi 580's and dt990's on the way. Sad thing is, both of those have better ratings, and combined only cost $20 more than these... The bass never came out like I thought it would, and by the time I had eq'd the bass to my spec (not a bass head mind you, I'm a reference/audiophile guy, the drivers were distorting trying to keep the extension low enough to use the cans for good ambient media... I was very disappointed these cans let me down, I really liked their imaging and flat response but below 80Hz they were not present as if the freq's were crossed out of the media.<br /><br />*Old reveiw*<br />Out of the box they were atrocious so I cranked up the [[ASIN:B004FI6AKW Bellari  HA540 Pure Class A Stereo Headphone Amplifier]] and let them set for 3 hours, listened again and it was easy to hear the difference below 50Hz and the sound was warmer and smoother than at first, They will be on non stop for the next 4 days and I will update with my conclusion, but just after 3 hours of near rms power they are the best sounding headphones I have personally heard, I expect great things. I am a mobile hifi guy with many installs capable of subharmonic f3's and these were able to put pressure on my ear drums as low as 25Hz enjoyably but below that they roll off quickly. As is I was able to get enough low end to please me and everyone else listening by adding .7dB @ 50Hz and 6dB @ 30Hz to flatten their pre burn in response and even though the low end was boosted I didnt hear any affect on the 8kHz+ range like you'd expect from low end headphones. They are a bit heavy, I found my neck fatigue after around 30 minutes and I'n no stranger to weight on my head being a motorcycle enthusiast. As is, even if post burn in doesnt lower their f3, a good eq is all its gonna take (and luckily I have one handy) to add reference level sub 35Hz extension. I'm pondering a full studio setup just to run them to their sq limits to see what they are capable of but im on the fence about that lol.<br /><br />Best Eq overall at this point was -.7@4kHz, +1.4@250Hz, +.7@50Hz, +6dB@30Hz (no matter what music type I played through them, their reproduction was very detailed and clear.

B00846REIS|5.0|So Good!! Right along with 50 Shades, but a lot less freaky for the better. 2 Thumbs way up :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|whoever created this app is a genius!!!!!  I love it. nothing bad to say about it. great job!!!!!  thank you so much!!!
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book!  So many twists and turns I didn't see coming!  I really enjoyed her writing style.  I look forward to reading more of her work!
B00571F26Y|5.0|I'm only 2 weeks into a wheat free existence, but already feel better.  I eat smaller meals, but I'm not hungry all the time like I am when I follow regular diets.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great reading and Ken made it easy to \\"recall\\" the previous characters from 1st book and move on with the families from there.
0786958731|5.0|I bought this for my nephew last year. He had met R.A. Salvatore at a book signing. This game has many cool pieces and a great theme. These boxed board games are much more fun than paper and pencil RPG's because of the wonderful visual aspect of the board and pieces. The Legend of Drizzt Board Game is a great, fun game. My nephew likes it a lot!
B00080ZG10|3.0|This movie feels like the writer wasn't sure what it was about. Yes, it was about Howard Hughes, but what part of his life? His wildly successful out-of-the-box thinking and entrepreneurial spirit? His OCD? His obsession with flight? His love affairs? His tenacity when taking on the U.S. Senate? Any of those would be interesting things to focus on in a movie, but having a little of all of those things makes it a really big bite to chew. The performances are great. The settings are fine. The pacing is a bit slow at times, especially in the second half. The ending is abrupt, but it's worth seeing. At almost 3 hours, you may not want to watch it again, but it's worth a single go at least.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I read this book recently on my Kindle and was pleasantly surprised.  The book is very well-written, incredibly descriptive, and entertaining.  I liked the different story lines within the story.  It is the first book I have read that I would actually WANT them to make it into a movie.  Great read!  I am recommending it to my book club.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Its one of the best games I have you need to get it.I cant stop playing it.Get it now.I know you want to.
0785163174|4.0|not as bad folks make out to be, great read if you just looking for some fun and not the meaning of the universe in your comics
B005LAIHR2|4.0|My wife dragged me to this movie in the theatre.  I was pretty sure it would suck.  I was completely wrong!<br /><br />I grew up in the '80s, and this was a great pageant to that decade!  Loved it.<br /><br />The DVD is great.  Only complaint is that the electronic copy requires a flixter account, and the account set-up was buggy (and undesired; I already have an UltraViolet account - why did it create a new one for me even when I told the page to use the one I already have?).  Definite fail on the part of the flixter devs.<br /><br />A minor annoyance compared to the fun I have watching this movie.  And singing (badly) along with a lot of my favorite songs from when I was a teen.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|This record reunites the rumors crew, with the exception of christine mckie. While the band assured us during the promotional run for the album that her absence didn't hinder the sound of the band...the fact is that christine is the woman who wrote some of the most undeniable classics of the bands career..including everywhere, little lies, hold me, etc.  To deny her influence in the bands success would be unfair...however say you will still has many moments of magic to it. At times it feels overly long and experimental in a tiresome way...with several songs being strong but overstaying their welcome....and others simply taking up space...and would have been perfectly suited as a b side and not an album track. The album almost bears a structure similar to tusk...in which it drags on and on, gently berating you with pop songs in a variety of moods and styles...but the band hits its stride when it revisits its summery california pop vibe. the title track is probably the best thing on here, though it does layer on the sap for the finale of the song, which features a crowd of children singing. Destiny rules is simply as good as it sounds...with rich, longing lyrics and the crispness of stevie voice....it's rich. bleed to love her has a warm, sweeping melody. Nothing on here approaches dreams, and nothing ever will.
080701429X|4.0|Great read about a psychologists view from behind the walls of a concentration camp. At least the first part is; in the second part, he explains his theory of logotherapy.
159562015X|5.0|Got the book for several of my staff as one of my objectives was to focus on fit, getting the right person for the task at hand.  What better way than Strenghts Finder!  Highly recommend the book.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I really loved this 3rd book of the series. I am so glad that I read all three, and ''Fifty Shades Freed' finished the story off so well.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Much more than what I expected. My daughter saw this in the theatre with her Grandpa and has talked about it since. She'll be estatic she can watch it at home now.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read, I read it all in one sitting then went back the next day and read again<br /><br />If you love romance this is for you!!! Def a read again book
B0013ND30M|5.0|Who doesn't like Sleeping Beauty?  The only one better is Cinderella.  He likes Disney, so I buy Disney.  Haven't seen this in years, but I'd like to again.
0316228532|5.0|Yes, I truly read Casual Vacancy...not once, but twice now. I also attended the NYC event where J.K. Rowling spoke about her new book, got to meet her and have my book signed. It was very informative and gave me many new perspectives to think about once I read it a 2nd time. When I first started reading the book I thought...\\"What the F?...\\"did she just say that?\\" and \\"we are not in Hogwarts anymore\\"...and it was quite slow at the start, however I pushed on, and as I kept reading I became more and more engrossed in the story. This is NOT a book for Kids! Sorry,  if that is what you were expecting,you are in for a huge surprise, and J.K.Rowling warned us all about it too. Nothing is \\"sugar coated\\" here. J.K. tells a gritty, risky, and at times disturbing tale, about the reality that is life in many places in the world. Though there where many moments and scenes that I (as a HP reader) could just not believe that this was the same writer of that magical books we all grew to love, however there were also many scenes where J.K. Rowling's humor and genius truly shines. She did not write this book purely for shock value or because \\"she could\\"...she wrote it because she truly believed in her story, and in her characters. The book makes you think, it makes you have to see what potentially you might not be ready to see or swallow. This is one of the reasons I think many people find it off-putting. There are many things through out the story that could have happened to ourselves, or to people we know...ugly truths that most people don't want to face. By the time I was 50-60 pages in I just could not put it down. I laughed and I cried, and though it was not fantasy, or Harry...it was wonderful. I highly recommend it, to anyone \\"GROWN UP\\" enough to face the truths within it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|No resemblance to the little statue in Copenhagen's harbor, but a great tale and one of Disney's best, I think.
B009FB3XTA|2.0|I have loved the Twilight movie soundtracks. So I was very excited to buy this one on the day it came out. After listening to it, I must say I am disappointed. I really didn't like any of the songs except for  The Forgotten by Green day and A Thousand Years by Christina Perry
B0000AQZYM|4.0|This is a Christmas gift, but I enjoyed the one I saw.  As long as this is new, it's what he wanted.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Well written engulfs you keeps your interest even if the house is on fire. Can't wait to read the rest of the books
B003DZX44I|5.0|This one is great with a wonderful life lesson.  Disney does princesses so well!  I loved the Disney tales, his mother loved them, and I hope my grandson will enjoy all of them.
B00466HM28|5.0|It work great work perfectly I haven't stoped using it thanks alot the it was also package well thank you so much I will definitely recommend your stuff to myth friends
B0076DCT2G|5.0|If you like DeMille, then you love John Corey - DeMille's book are always entertaining - and John Corey is always hysterical - Wish I could think that fast (to be that funny)!  I understand why Kate is always ready to kill him.  If you like DeMille, then just buy it.  Always exciting and entertaining right from the start.
6304925131|5.0|Its a much better movie if you have not read the book, good cast interesting storyline. You wont be sorry.
B008RTE08E|1.0|Well I am a die-hard Beatles fan... I absolutely love the Beatles, I'd do anything just to go back in time to see them perform or take the trip of my life with them :), but save your money by not buying THE WORST MOVIE IVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, 20 dollars for this is ridiculous I can't believe I wasted my money on it, after the first time of watching it I had to throw the dvd in the garbage, so dissapointed.... Please save your money and do not even consider this horrible movie, I still LOVE The Beatles and always will but this movie has made me lose some respect for them as much as that hurts me to say.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have been a Patricia Cornwell/Dr. Scarpetta fan for years.  But I have yet to finish Trace or Red Mist.  The author really missed the boat on these two.  I was very skeptical about buying The Bone Bed until I read numerous positive reviews.  The original cast is back, working together, using forensics to solve the murders.  Welcome back.  Can't wait for another.
B008PCVGKI|5.0|Bad Pharma is about how so many things in the process of finding the best treatment for patients can and do go wrong. In one corner, there are researchers, academics and doctors who believe in the scientific method to give us true evidence based medicine, and in the other corner are bureaucrats, pharmaceutical companies, poor legislation, etc.<br /><br />Every chapter contains disturbing (actually shocking) descriptions of deception, ignorance or stupidity, to make you both enraged and utterly pessimistic about any of this ever becoming better.<br /><br />I'm grateful that there are people like Dr. Ben Goldacre who will spend so much time and effort to bring us books like these. If I could, I would nominate this book and Dr. Goldacre for the Pulitzer Prize.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Better than some of Sparks other books...a lot more detail and insight than the movie can give. More intrigue than the standard Sparks.
B003QS9WIE|3.0|The movie was fine. not great, just fine. not the best movie considering the cast and director.<br />But worth watching if you can't find anything else.
B0064W652A|5.0|brilliant, gripping, loved it. This is one of the great stories, the twists and turns, the Batman history used, excellent
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is a great read.  It's a great introduction to ultra-marathoning and minimalist/barefoot running.  It has been a launching point for me to learn about other ultra-marathoners, the Tarahumara, Vibram 5-fingers...the list goes on and on.  Read this book.  You will be glad you did.
B0031R5K8G|5.0|This book is unbelivebel. It gives you so good insight of people with this desease ,that you can almost understand what the person is going thru and<br />this book opend my mind to understand that we all are wonders of the world.
1936891026|5.0|I've taken courses and read books. I've written a couple of lame drafts. I've tried to give up numerous times, but still ended up scribbling bits of stories here and there.<br /><br />But now I have this book which enables me to call the enemy what it is and to understand how it stops me. And to recognize why I must write, so I can kick Resistance to the curb and keep writing.<br /><br />This time is different.<br /><br />Have already read it twice.<br /><br />Buy it. It's that expensive life-coaching session you always kind of toyed with signing up for...but now you can afford it.
B0000696IE|5.0|love love love this movie....sent it again to my sister for her granchildren and they really loved it...but cried and were afraid to watch parts...again go figure kids.:}
0316223239|5.0|Could not put this book down! Yes, the subject matter seems ripped right from the headlines, but what sets this book apart is the insightful characterization of both Ma and Jack. And the decision to narrate the story from Jack's point of view was brilliant; not since Scout in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" have I encountered such a well-written child narrator.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I always wanted to purchase this now I did from the Amazon it's a great movie thank you for giving it to me for a great price
B0063M22QO|4.0|I love this game, have had others something like it.  I need to reread the instructions though, not real clear on how to pick the game formation that I want.  I play it every night, hard to stop at times.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|This was an odd, but extremely enjoyable movie.  The wife and I loved it!!  The premise was a positive slant on what could happen in the mid-east if only folks would give it a chance.  There were some funny scenes taking place in UK government circles that speaks to political impact to ideas folks come up with.
B000VNMMPM|4.0|Loved the narration, visual treatment of the camera, great to watch this french masterpiece. However, seeing just the two characters on the screen all the time makes it a bit boring at time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I absalutly love this game!you see me and my dad red some of the reviews and he thought the reason some of the reviews were 1star was that they had played the computer version.but not me.so thanks Mojang!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Me and my children really enjoy playing coin dozer, just not taking turns. But if time it right you don't need to share.
0440245915|5.0|I bought this book years ago and read it again a few weeks back. I think it holds up to the same challenges we face today that we did twenty years ago, twenty years before that and so on. Our perceptions of justice and our ideas of what we would do if put in the same place are rattled by this story. Is it really a crime to punish those who committed a horrible crime in the first place? What if it was your daughter? I hope a new generation of readers finds this book again because it really is a favorite.
0316228532|5.0|I've seen many reviews about the slow plot development and convoluted character web, but Jo just does such a fantastic job vicariously creating the world such that the reader is completely overwhelmed into the story itself. The characters are brilliantly developed, the societal criticism sharp yet subtle, and the environment thrilling. It is truly what has set her into the adult literary world.
B008FDP7AW|5.0|I should mention from the outset that I'm a little biased, because Skynyrd is my favorite band in the entire world. But this album is great. I don't know why, but I love almost all their songs whether it's 70s Skynyrd (Ronnie Van Zant) or current iteration (Johnnie Van Zant) since the plane crash. Go Skynyrd!
B00A14SQBU|5.0|WOW...this album is truly amazing, from start to finish, very multi-layered. This is a very fun, empowering, emotional and sassy record all wrapped up in one, I loved every song, didn't even skip a single track...if you love great music, get this. Won't be disappointed at all. Great Job Christina.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is fun,  the levels are extensive and the HD video quality game play is fabulous.  I hope that the maker of subay surfer create even more games for the consumer.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Well-made, love the look of this cover.  It's sturdy, holds up well in my purse, with about a months worth of use it has not bent at the corners.  Love the feel when I hold it, lighter weight than my heavy-duty holder and I actually feel like I'm holding a book.  The straps that hold it in do not get in the way so the design is well done.  The pocket can hold things you need to take with you if you just want to grab your Kindle and go (I like to sometimes).  It's very attractive and has generated some conversation with friends.  I would highly recommend this cover if you are looking for an attractive case to keep your Kindle Fire safe.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I admit that I initially didn't like The Deftones that much when they debuted with Adrenaline. As a matter of fact,the next three out of four albums were just ok,the exception being White Pony,that album is good,but from Saturday Night Wrist to Koi No Yokan,they have been consistently good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So realistic when they wipe out the zombies. I mean they took them out so many different way, and it was super realistic looking. The plot is great, and I am going to be sucked into watching the other seasons. Dang it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is awesome.  It's great if you follow it the way it's intended and it's also great to just pop in as your go to workout.  20 minutes of very well spent workout time!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was one of those books that I just couldn't put down; I needed to see how it would end!  It's what I would consider an easy read but full of details, foreshadowing and interesting dilemma's that turn it into a great book.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|look, i[m a big fan of the original trilogy of ALIEN, but all the stuff since RESSURECTION is really not good....this one, prometheus is really disgusting....there[s lots of body explosions, strange aliens and NO story....really, who wrote this thing????it[s the same guy who wrote the first classic one?????? There[s no story on Prometheus, but a lot of horrible scenes......HORRIBLE MOVIE!!!! By far the worst film of the ALIEN SAGA.....BLLEEEEEERRRRRGHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0089J29C6|5.0|The quality of the Blu-Ray is excellant. You notice the beautiful colors though not as vibrant as the Diamonds are a Girls best friend Blu-Ray. This is an excellant movie. Becall is the star in this movie even though Monroe steals several scenes. In this movie you can see the transition from Blonde Bombshell Betty Grable to the younger Monroe, I think it's evolution. Overall the film is witty and funny. Enjoyable if you are a fan on the classics and Monroe.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|After playing the DVD about 3 times it stopped working and started freezing on the screen.  It was a real disappointment for my son, I am probably going to end up buying a new DVD of this film somewhere else.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|If you are as big of a fan of The Walking Dead as I am, there is no other way to watch the show than on Blu-ray. Perfect picture for a perfect show.
6305428042|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone. If you haven't seen it, than I suggest you do! This product is an affordable price too!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great for the kids ... kinda the same set up as the popular Mario brothers my kids love it!  great game.
B0086700CM|5.0|This kindle i got for my birthday is off the hook. I love it so much i could hardly breath at all<br /><br />  Thanks best buy<br />love,<br />Sarah
B006LSZECO|4.0|A little slow to start but then it really takes off and I couldn't put it down. Makes me stop and wonder if we are all \\"cool\\" girls in the beginning of relationships...
B009VB9VKY|2.0|I soooo wanted to like this movie.  The story's been done before (Boy meets girl.  The girl makes the boy see his future if he keeps playing hard. Hint: she's not in it. Boy leaves it all for the girl).  This movie was so hyped up prior to it's theatrical release that I expected it to be a good movie.  I didn't expect it to be award worthy, just entertaining.  I couldn't even get into the sound track.  It was eye candy for about 10 minutes once the story hit the club.  After that it was predictable and boring. Skip it and watch Studio 54, or Boogie Nights again.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|It really keeps you watching as something new is happening with each episode.  The characters continue to be developed and you really progress with them.  I love the tongue in cheek humor of grandmother Crowley.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|Very good futuristic movie. Also an early Christian Bailey movie. Would highly recommend. To anyone how liked the batman series.
B0072QPV6I|5.0|Unbelieveable, Awesome, Excitement Inducing..... and many more adjectives are needed to describe this movie... R u a chem. bros. fan? U better get this movie then :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for-nothing fancy. Just basic calculator that is easy to use and see when on the go.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A refreshingly original fantasy. Not only does the author bring a very original world to life, the characters are very real and the plot has some excellent twists!
0316228532|5.0|Having read the Harry Potter series when my kids were growing up with it, and enjoying it tremendously, I was thrilled that J.K. Rowling had written an adult book.  It did not disappoint.  Rowling knows how to draw you into a story and have you become vested in the characters pretty quickly. The writing and story are truthful and gritty. Although the plot revolves around small town British life, it digs deep into the psyche of the picture postcard town exposing it's pretty nasty underbelly. I listened to the book on CD and enjoyed every minute of it.  Can't wait for J.K. Rowling's next book.
0671015206|5.0|This book is an eye opener.  It should be standard reading for high schools and/or colleges. It has changed my way of thinking on many fronts. I like how the authors discuss the high income - low net worth individuals and break down their life styles.  I have always been a decent saver, but this has changed my way of thinking in many areas.  Seriously... for $15 or whatever the book is selling for now, buy it!  Don't delay.  I wish the authors release a newer edition in the future.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|I really like this watch.  I wore it for the first time and received very positive reviews from all my friends.<br />They asked me to take it off my wrist so they could inspect it.  They all thought it was a great looking watch. I was very happy with their response.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great Story line!! Very well written. Couldn't put it down, City of Bones draws you in from the first page.
B007EDYN36|4.0|I'm a few pages away from the end of Peter's book and I have to say that was very informative and entertaining to read. I feel he has accepted his own failings but seems to complain about his circumstances a bit too much. Once you get \\"screwed\\" by one or two people, you will usually learn from your mistakes and yet, Peter continued to sign contracts and agree to terms that he later claim to be misleading and unfair. Doc McGhee claims that half of what he says is \\"untrue\\" or never happened (as per KISS KRUISE 2012 Q&A session) but I tend to feel that Peter is telling the truth from his perspective and understanding. I especially admired the way he credits Bill Aucoin and Sean Delaney for their efforts in building the KISS brand. The bottom line is that we are all human and like most rock and roll bios, money and fame tend to create out-of-control partying, egos and misunderstandings.  KISS gave me a grand escape in my youth. Now they are giving me another element of that escape in their biographies. It's all for the love of rock and roll ;) ;)
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|As an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I loved the fantasy as well as the pictures. I would recommend.
0671027344|5.0|I actually felt that Stephen Chbosky gets it. Being an introvert myself life isn't always a walk in the park. Hard to make friends, talking to people, having to &#34;participate&#34;, yeah I've been through a lot trying to overcome those situations one step at a time. This was a remarkable story about life through an Introvert's life. Maybe now people can try to understand us more. With many memorable quotes this book has become my favorite of them all yet.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This novel was disturbingly good.  I was completely drawn into the story and didn't want to put it down.  Great!
0544045203|5.0|Life of Pi was wonderfully beautiful reading it through the eyes of a young wise boy. He obviously showed he understood more than adults can at such a young age. While it had plenty humorous moments, It specified serious topics as well. I cried. I cannot wait for the movie, I just hope it's as wonderful as the book.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Great soundtrack. Wish they had included Beca's mixes as well. But the songs they do have are awesome! Anna Kendrick is a fantastic singer!
B003UMW68Y|5.0|I have always wanted to own all of Tim Burton's movies. I love them especially The Nightmare Before Christmas which I am obsessed with it's style and characters. The Musical numbers are amazing too. Love how this dvd also came with the original short film of Frankenweenie. Tim Burton is just a genius!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent book! I loved the style with which it was written. It was very real and a very inspirational book!
B0064T6LV8|3.0|i realy like this game.it works grate on my kindle fire.when i first got it i had a few adds that poped up.but after a bout a week they stoped only 1 every now and then.the game is well worth it and its free.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It was a different from any of John Grisham's previous books and was very entertaining.  The more I read, the more intriguing it became and I found it hard to put down.<br />.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|This book is a great read for a range of ages.  As a woman in my early 30s, I appreciated the style and the subject matter.  I have worked with children and adults with disabilities for many years and this book was a great reminder of perspective.  I would say children from 5th grade to adulthood would glean a lot from this story, and enjoy the read as well.  Recommend it!
0553801473|1.0|I have enjoyed all the previous Game of Throne books, but this one was horrible! It was unnecessarily complex, introduced a multitude of unimportant characters, killed off major characters and lost any semblance of a story line.  It took me four months to finish it and I only did it to say I did. Don't read this book!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Nice movie to watch with kids and family. Will recommend everyone to watch and enjoy. Liked tge action and storyline.
B004H83IM8|3.0|this item will be a xmas gift, so thats why 3 stars only. im hoping they like the gift of power
B003EY7JH6|5.0|Despite the years that passed between the creation of the original trilogy and this book, the characters and situations give the same awesome feeling from the original stories, and somehow Asimov manages to add advanced technology that doesn't make the Foundation discoveries look bad. I don't want to include spoilers, so I will just say that you are in for a treat.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Love all John Corey stories. I wait patiently for a  new one.  The only down point is when I finish and have to wait again.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love all her albums but her voice just keeps getting better !  She interprets the songs with emotion, her voice  is crystal clear, great range, sweet, perfect intonation.  The album has  a beautiful selection of songs.  This album is magnificent !
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the first book so well that I had to download the second Fifty book to my kindle. The second book followed quite well. It sometimes got a little sappy with all the emails being sent. I wondered when they got any work done.
B005IQZB14|4.0|This is a wonderful, entertaining, and soul searching  book.  It brings a sense of peace to both the author and the reader, as both unravel the complexities of family, friends, emotions and sense of self. I very rarely read books twice, but this one I will!
B007TXN4TK|1.0|honestly if I weren't hypered that day I wouldn't have wasted my quality time on this pathetic game if you want to make us into Alicia keys deliver me a real piano at my house 6:00am once again nothing but a stupid app!!!#$#*&amp;#%a.k.a: boring
B009JNXK88|5.0|This reminds me of MegaMan without the blaster.  Extremely challenging, very fun, and thankfully the levels are short, so if you die you're not losing too much time.<br /><br />Only thing I'd like to see is some sort of \\"bad-guy index.\\"  Just today I figured out you could attack the Ninjas (when still) and gun cannons.
B008KE3960|1.0|I'm confused am I five or six.????? this game is so weak. I'd rather be running the new York city marthon. take my advice and don't buy this piece of crap. it'll make you wish you didn't buy it. nothing but a waste of time.!!!'@$#%#&amp;*a.k.a:boring

B0063IH60K|1.0|no offense but this is a pretty slow game. why not make an action packed game.f.y.I: it's way more fun;believe me.
0385738773|2.0|I actually enjoyed the author's writing style, but after reading all three books in the series, I was left with a terrible ending.  I don't know why I find the ending so anti-climatic, but it left me wondering why all the betrayals throughout the books.  If all of the characters fell for these simple manipulations, then they weren't as intelligent as the books suggested they were.<br /><br />I felt as though the author was winging it until the very end and decided not to think it through.  I was very disappointed.
B005HSL626|4.0|is it me or do apps like this really suck. if were gonna play freeze tag can we play it without you freezing up every 2minutes future advice:don't hate the player hate the game.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|I won't review the film as everyone knows by now how great it is. I live in England and ordered this copy from the states specifically for the directors commentary by joss whedon(the mans a legend!!) which is not available on the blu ray special features over here. When I saw this edition I thought it sounded good so paid the extra for it. But the digital version and the soundtrack I can't download as it needs to be done in America. So I feel stupid lol but at least I got the commentary :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't believe I was playing this till midnight!!! I almost fell asleep with my fingers still moving as if I was still playing. o.m.g!!!!!!!#%&amp;&amp;*@!
B003QO8TDC|4.0|Brings me back to when my kids were just starting to get into &#34;music&#34; - this was one of the favorite dance and music movies --- brings back terrific memories...
B004SIIBGU|2.0|why would you wait till now to have me down load this when I was waiting in August. there's one thing you need to know about me ......1minute.....ummmmm I'm impatient. duh everyone know that you're soooooo lattteee!!!!#$&amp;&amp;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it. it is very addicting. not a day goes by that I am not on ice age village. very cool.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I had to temporarily disconnect my cell phone service so I was looking for ways to still be able to communicate to close friends and family. My son is way more hip than me so he let me know about Kik Messenger. This can be easily downloaded and used provided that you have WiFi capabilities. I can text and send picture messages just as I could when my phone service was still on. I had to download and install Groove IP in order to be able to make outgoing calls for free. That, too, works with WiFi as well.
B001TCHDPS|4.0|I bought this CD after watching the documentary 'Searching for Sugarman' and it worth the cost of entry. Rodriguez should have made it big in the 70s but it just wasn't to be. I thoroughly enjoyed his second album. It is like a found gem. Enjoy.
B000001E3V|5.0|While Clapton was with Derek & the Dominos,....he was at his best heavy rock guitar playing.  Absolutley LOVE this recording.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book cannot wait for her next Crossfire novel to come out. Easy read and an interesting ending. Was kind of surptised
0345522478|5.0|The Iron Druid series is a great series. Very entertaining, well-developed and intriging characters, strong writing, and good plots. I read the entire series on a trip to the middle east on my Kindle, even though I *should* have spent the time doing other stuff. Highly recommended.
B0089K7DGW|4.0|Bought this because of Kenneth Michael Williams, Omar. Season one was good did more laying of ground work for future seasons than tell a story. At first Buschemi didn't fit as nucky but after a few episodes I bought in. Can't decide if the costumes and props are lame accurate or both. The acting is good for the most part. Also the only reason I bought this was because it wasn't on Netflix. Gotta say I liked it and would recommend it to those looking for a good crime drama. Its no Wire but nothing is.
1594484805|4.0|Pink discusses how carrot and stick approach in traditional management often backfires resulting in extinguishing intrinsic motivation. He suggests that intrinsic motivation is built and strengthened by the following once basic compensation is fair and off the table:<br />1. autonomous - freedom to choose what one works on, who one works with, how work gets accomplished<br />2. mastery - deeper learning where a person exercises his strengths and focuses on solving problems that are a a tad beyond his reach<br />3. purpose - person is passionate about how he will contribute to something larger than himself<br /><br />The book is somewhat verbose.
B006YMMFT2|5.0|It's not very often that I see an anime movie and that I turn out impressed and actually very pleased but Redline is actually very stunning and amazing. Watch it!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I thought it followed the book but also elaborated a bit more where it was helpful in preparing for the next one.  Loved the NC scenery.
B0067RQYNW|3.0|I have the first Galaxy S unrooted, so it is kind of slow, so this app was a little slow for me. It is a good app, but my excel spreadsheet didn't open. But for a free app, it is worth it.
0811879542|5.0|I substitute teach and always have this book with me.  The kids think this is a magical book. Buy it..
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Wow, I'm almost speechless as this album exceeded my expectations. King Animal is a masterpiece and truly a work of art! As a huge Soundgarden fan, I wasn't sure what to expect as they are so diverse from album to album and as a result I'm blown away. I can't stop listening to the album from front to back. So many influences from different angles here along with the usual psychedelic references, time signatures, complex rhythms, and musical sophistication. I love every song but \\"Non-State Actor, A Thousand Days Before, Black Saturday, and Rowing\\" are unbelievable and some of the best Soundgarden songs ever! There is only one other band who can come to the overall consistency, intelligence, and awesomeness of Soundgarden, and that is Led Zeppelin. Go buy the album and support the band as it is very hard to come across good music that is successful these days.
B000002KDO|5.0|Having heard and owned the 1st 2 LPs (yeah, vinyl back then), I will admit I drank A LOT OF FRIGGIN' BEER and smoked a reasonable amount of reefer to this record.  Likely the heaviest record recorded up to that point, I personally had a couple of friends that were rather spooked and scared by this monsterous slab of riffs...roll one up
B00005JOA0|4.0|I was surprised at how graphic this video was.  I enjoyed the movie, but it was interrupted frequently when my kids kept coming in.  Be warned - it is highly suggestive with frequency!
B00000255F|5.0|Well, all I can say about this CD is \\"Wow\\". I was too young to own an LP when it came out, but I remember hearing the title track on the radio and, without understanding the lyrics much at the time, just feeling the energy of Springsteen's voice. Now that I have CD version, which I keep playing over and over again, I can't help but be impressed at the sheer magnitude of this album, from start to finish. Every song has its own raw emotion and power, and its own story to tell. But as much as I love the title track (and I sure do), I would probably vote \\"Jungleland\\" as my favorite. The sheer sounds swirling around, the vivid imagery, and the Boss' unforgettable lyrics combine to make this truly astonishing. I guess it was too long for the commercial radio stations to play when I was young, because I don't think I ever heard it played. Simply breathtaking. Overall, surely Springsteen's greatest triumph. Even my kids don't mind when I pop it in the car, and that tells you a lot! I can't wait to try \\"The River\\" next, at my neighbor's urging. But it will take a lot to top this one...
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app works wonderfully! I think it works better on here than on the computer. No glitches or freezing. I had NO trouble signing in with my facebook account! I love this app!!!!!!!!!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Excellent-can't put the book down. Ms. Cornwell makes you feel that she and the forensic team are a part of your family
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Lawrence of Arabia is easily one of the greatest films ever made and there are plenty of reviews and comments already out there, so here's my review of the 50th Anniversary Blu-ray.  It looks and sounds absolutely stunning.  I could not have asked for it to look or sound any better.  It took a long time to get here, but Sony has not let us down.  Now, I've seen the film dozens of times, mostly in theaters in L.A., but I don't remember every frame of it to be one of the people who will inevitably show up here and say they were disappointed because the color correction of this or that scene was too cool or too warm, etc. compared to \\"the way it's supposed to be.\\"  They may be right, they may be wrong.  But certainly nothing jumped out at me or ruined the experience.<br /><br />The Blu-ray is available alone or in a 50th Anniversary set, which is what I got.  The Anniversary packaging is very nice and the book looks great, though I've only browsed through it so far.  And I haven't had time to watch any of the extras yet though I did watch part of the film with the information pop-ups and they were pretty good.<br /><br />I could not be happier with how good this movie looks on Blu!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Captain America is a bore but Iron Man lights it up! Overall a good movie. People who like action flicks will like this one...
0345528581|5.0|A brilliantly designed series of programs for people at varying levels of fitness, and a terrific assortment of exercises are the book's strengths, along with a clear explanation of the value of bodyweight exercises. I bought the kindle version and ordered the paperback as it's hard to flip back and forth on the kindle to see the explanation of the exercises. The other books on bodyweight exercise (and on using weights) that I recommend are written by Ross Enamait, and sold directly by Ross, but they are not as user-friendly, and seem geared toward a more hardcore crowd. This title with Ross's would give you a complete library of bodyweight exercises and routines. It's superb.
B008OOYALE|5.0|hours of fun great variety of dragons and nice features The only drawback is most things are very expensive to purchase.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had heard great things from my friends who saw the series on HBO. I bought it for my husband's birthday; he's enjoying the series very much. Fabulous casting!
B009KKLQKO|1.0|I grew up in the 1960's in Southern California, & am a lifelong Beach Boys fan. I attended this concert in my adopted home of New Mexico. I have attended one other Beach Boys concert here, & without Brian Wilson, it was just a mediocre show. Let me tell you- the show in Albuquerque rocked! I think it a travesty that so much great music/video ended up on some cutting room floor...<br /><br /> I havn't seen the video because it hasn't been released yet. I suppose that if you didn't attend one of their last concerts, you will probably be satisfied with the final product. However, those of us who did see the concert would like to relive the memory in it's entirety!<br /><br /> Since the 1970's, there has been a plethora of \\"Best of\\" & \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums released, & what I see here is more of the same old thing handed to us in DVD format. Who determines what songs go in, & which stay out? I think the fans should have the right to decide what they want to hear & see with their \\"skip\\" or \\"fast-forward\\" button!<br /><br /> I don't know about anyone else, but I sure don't like someone doing my thinking for me! I would gladly pay twice the price for the full version of their concert. So, the record label want's to make more money but appealing to a larger customer base with an abbreviated & inferior product??? Well they lost my $$$, & judging by the vast majority of reviews, quite a few others dollars too!<br /><br /> So how can I rate the DVD? I can't, but I can speak out against corporate greed!
B005HS4CUY|4.0|A lot of the reviews said this included the dvd, digital copy, bluray and 3d bluray - it only has a digital copy code and the 3d bluray.
B00846REIS|5.0|Like a lot of women, I was looking for something to fill the void after reading the \\"50 shades\\" series, and I gotta say, this book definitely done that & then some!  I loved Gideon, maybe even more so than Christian Grey! The story is so great & the characters are very well written.  Plus, the sex scenes are pretty steamy, to say the least!!  I was hooked from page one & I am currently on book 2. I am So glad that I gave this book a try!
B003WH765U|5.0|couldn't wait to receive this movie. I watched it and I will definetely watch it again and again.  If you like a good love story buy it.
B008NR8YTQ|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Jimi since i first heard him in the 60's, Gary did a fine tribute in his honor. One of the best Ax men ever.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought the concept and story was good.  I understand that the author is a very intelligent man but thought the book became too clinical and would have loved to have more of the personal side of the experience.  Gives me comfort that the medical world can also have a spiritual influence.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|When I  first started watching the Sons of Anarchy series I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  It soon became addicting, it's not like any series I've ever seen.  It's smart, well written and you never know what will happen.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I think many people who read this book were under the impression that it was going to follow in the footsteps of the Harry Potter storyline. I went into it without this expectation and enjoyed the book. It is a simple story that conveys the stark realities of class distinction. The characters are believable and easy to like or dislike.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|Some things I like about this is the wake up mode on it. Now that the button is different from the old Kindle Fire I find it more difficult to find. The case itself probably won't protect the Kindle from breaking if you drop it but it does protect the face from scratching when it's in your purse or just hanging around the home.<br /><br />Some things I don't like about this is when it's setup for the wake mode there is no way of charging the Fire without leaving the cover open, essentially, rendering the cover useless. If I switch the Fire around in the case then the wake-up mode doesn't work. I think even if they did something as simple as leaving an opening in the binding side for the charger to fit while the cover is closed would have gone a long way in making this a success.<br /><br />I like the fact that it has a strap to keep the cover closed. A lot of other covers don't have that and while they're in my purse they can and have opened up. This one is secure and keeps the cover in place at all times.<br /><br />Some games and other apps require this to be on it's side. The soft interior of the cover keeps the kindle in the landscape position without any issues. However, other apps and games require this to be in the upright position and there's nothing that keeps it that way. You have to hold it in that position and sometimes it gets a little uncomfortable with the cover folded over as it does. Maybe a small hand-strap somewhere would help make it more comfortable.<br /><br />While it certainly has it's flaws it's a good cover. I love the colors they come in. I got the purple case and the color is not as bright as the image would make it seem. Still, it's a lovely color.

Then the diffuser monitors your display automatically until it requires another calibration (typically 1 month - but can be adjusted to your liking).
B008GVD6D8|5.0|For someone who doesn't read books - what can I say?!  I started with 50 shades and loved them, read them within a week, which for me is truly amazing.  A friend gave be bared to you - it's hard not to compare everything back to 50 shades, but as soon as I finished her paper book, I down loaded Reflected in you..... I am now hooked on reading. As soon as I finished this book, I have booked the next one which is due out in May - the wait is killing me!  The book has a great story  line, and I love the twists.  It's a must read!

What a disappointment.

B00A2GQT5C|4.0|This collection is almost similar to \\"Whitney Houston: The Ultimate Collection\\" which I bought earlier this year. What I see in this collection and what I purchased is they both contained the album/Top 40 versions of her hits as opposed to club mixes of \\"The Greatest Hits\\" offering. Anyone who is looking for that should be pleased with this collection.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This is a great book.  I purchased this book about 12 years ago and loved it.  I must have loaned it out to someone that never gave it back so I purchased the digital version for my Kindle app on my Android.  This updated version has great additional info that I sure don't remember from before.<br /><br />I have wavy hair and I needed some reminders on how to care for it and I got it in the book.  I have loved my curls ever since I bought the book 12 years ago, I have never looked back.<br /><br />My disappointment lies with the fact that my device can not handle the videos that are included and although I knew that when I bought it, I think a price break would be appropriate.
0739366408|5.0|I'll start by saying I love this book and have read it multiple times. That being said this is not for everyone. As many have said there is little character development throughout and that is mostly because this is written more as a UN Report than some journalist trying to collect everyones life story. Its basically a simple collection of 1st hand zombie survival accounts from the beginning of the outbreak to the end. If you are like me and enjoy getting more away from the small localized zombie apocolypse that most movies and books seem to focus on, and instead want a bigger picture of how governments would react and deal with the situation, this is the book for you hands down. Max brooks does a great job at the bigger picture and in many cases I feel like this is what a certain country would do or how people would react. Denial of the facts until it is to late and trying to save face is what many humans and governments would do in this situation and the portrayal is done rather well.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome.  It is just like the original alpha edition of the computer. That's right I said alpha.  It is not deveplod to be like the Pc version. Look even the x box version isn't up to Pc standards so don't complain. All in all this game is fun and you can let your imagination roam.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|I fondly remember the Dark Shadows of my childhood.  I am a fan of Johnny Depp. I love Tim Burton.  But this film was a hopless mess -- and boring!  My attention wandered during the second hour and I could hardly wait for it to be over.  All in all, a failure.

B0073PPKNM|1.0|I received the CD. It broke as I took it out of the CD box. I sent in a complaint. It was never acknowledged. I'm unhappy. I've wanted this CD for sometime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an awesome book. I read it twenty-seven times, and it is still the best book that I have ever read. I guess that to some parents, it could seem a bit gory, but it is still awesome. I am ten and me and all my friends have read it, and a few of my friends have some pretty over protective parents. I know that it is not my decision what people can and cannot read, but I  think that it is not entered on murder alone, but in my opinion, it is merely a strong tale of friendship, love, and courage. You have probably heard that some people have gone wacko from reading this, but I think, personally, that this book can make you a better person.<br /><br />P.S. if u hated this book, I think you may be a nut.<br /><br />P.P.S. If you did not like this book, maybe you should go see a psycaitrist<br /><br />P.P.P.S. I know I sounded like a mad idiot, but I was serious.

B00006G8K0|5.0|This is one of my favorite Dracula movies and I had it on VHS but wanted the DVD so it would last longer (not to mention VCR's fading away). The DVD arrived well within the time expected and the packaging was excellent. The DVD was in top notch condition as was the DVD package. Well worth the money for a classic Hammer film!
B00785P2QC|4.0|My only gripe is that the buildings are way overpriced compared to Virtual City. Other than that it's fine enough. I refuse to buy investment points,but I can still see myself enjoying the game.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|'Proof of Heaven: A neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife' was a fascinating account of a near death experience from some type of person from whom you would not expect to have such a experience.  This account is different when the person who described his NDE, is a scientific person, and the information relayed is from that point of view.  Since the science community normally try to discredit supernatural experiences, this neurosurgeon's description of his experience is coupled with the answers skeptical scientists would normally ask.  I found this a fascinating read.

B009NQKXYK|4.0|In spite of less than stellar reviews of Prometheus, I really enjoyed this film.  While sequels and prequels never seem to be as good as the original film, and that is true in this case, Prometheus had enough suspense and action to keep me watching!  While there are numerous lapses in logic, such as when the scientists decide to remove their protective helmets because they believe the air is safe to breathe, you have to suspend belief to a certain degree in most sci-fi films.

B00A03WBVI|5.0|I write this review knowing that I'm not in One Direction's target market, but I've been a supporter of them since their days on X-Factor and loved the debut album. With Take Me Home, the band have truly entered their \\"imperial phase,\\" that elusive world-dominating period that happens to the luckiest of pop stars, and usually with the second album. I'm thinking Katy Perry's Teenage Dream, Lady Gaga's Fame Monster, Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad, Nsync's No Strings Attached, etc. With any luck, the right singles choices will place this album amongst those successes. There will be many self-important, \\"credible\\" music lovers who will say that this type of transparently bubblegum pop has no merit, but I will continue to push back. I like fun music--music that makes you feel energized. And this is certainly an ample dose of it. You won't find many low scores here. The album's even more consistent than their debut.<br /><br />1. Live While We're Young - Kicking off the album, I feel like this is actually kind of a misstep as the first single. Not because it's a bad track, but because it's one of the weakest uptempos on the album. 8/10<br /><br />2. Kiss You - This is a step up, and follows the template of their breakthrough What Makes You Beautiful. It's got that punchy, guitar-assisted power pop feel that makes One Direction such an exciting prospect as a pop band. 9/10<br /><br />3. Little Things - Probably the most stripped-back song they've recorded yet. Co-written by Ed Sheeran, and it certainly sounds like it. It's the second UK single, and is definitely an interesting choice. 10/10<br /><br />4. C'mon C'mon - The most electronic track on the record, this has a great 80's vibe to it. I particularly love the middle eight, which really propels the song to that final, anthemic chorus. 10/10<br /><br />5. Last First Kiss - Despite the overall cheesiness of the lyrics, I just can't get the melody of this out of my head. The chorus is so ridiculously catchy. The sound is midtempo, but the production is so huge that it doesn't sound at all like a ballad. 9/10<br /><br />6. Heart Attack - Like Live While We're Young, this is one of the weaker uptempos on the album. It sounds slightly too American for my tastes--like something Maroon 5 would record. 8/10<br /><br />7. Rock Me - Oh, that chorus! At first, I thought that it would be too repetitive, but it just works. The production really shines. 10/10<br /><br />8. Change My Mind - Many have pointed out that this is too schmaltzy, but I'm not sure that's really an option with a band like One Direction. As a midtempo, it's a great way to break up the big dance tracks and the second half of the lovelorn chorus is particularly striking. These guys' vocals have improved so much since X-factor. 9/10<br /><br />9. I Would - This track was written by the guys of Mcfly, and if this is any indication, they should write the entirety of One Direction's next album. This is flawless power-pop. Really fun and huge and catchy. I can't rave enough. 10/10<br /><br />10. Over Again - The second Ed Sheeran written track, and it sounds even more like one of his own songs. Despite some cringeworthy lyrics, it's really a strong ballad with some excellent vocals. 9/10<br /><br />11. Back For You - Out of everything on the album, this feels the most like filler to me. It's the track I always forget. That's not saying it's bad, but it's just not very memorable. 8/10<br /><br />12. They Don't Know About Us - This is the complete opposite of unmemorable. If this isn't a single, I'll be really angry. This track is everything that was great about the late-90's teen pop boon crammed into one song. In fact, it sounds a lot like the Backstreet Boys in their imperial phase. The production on this is just flawless. Probably the best track on the album. 10/10<br /><br />13. Summer Love - A more straightforward, soft-rock type of track and, from the production notes, it seems that this is the song the boys had the biggesthand in creating. If so, then that bodes well for their future, because this is a very effective, very enjoyable closer to the album. 10/10<br /><br />14. She's Not Afraid - Back to the 80's-inspired power pop for the first of the deluxe edition bonus tracks. This is better than some of the uptempos on the actual album. Nothing revelatory, but a lot of fun. 9/10<br /><br />15. Loved You First - This is a gargantuan 80's pastiche, all chugging guitars and explosive, synth-drenched chorus. I would have loved to see this on the actual album, because it's incredibly strong. 10/10<br /><br />16. Nobody Compares - Another strong uptempo with great production and a real earworm melody. Fans of old-school power pop should really give this group a chance, because that's exactly what this is. 9/10<br /><br />17. Still The One - Just a little too frantic for me to give it one of the higher scores. That said, this would still be a highlight on most pop releases this year. 8/10<br /><br />Album Grade: 9.2/10
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The book is a quick read.  It is a bit predictable which disappointed me.  I have read all of Grisham's previous works and this one did not stand up to his earlier standards.

B005LCECU6|5.0|Only a true Rush fan can appreciate this live performance! Just came in the mail yesterday, listening as I write this review. The audio, panning left and right is a bit annoying but if you can listen beyond this minor blemmish, you could tell this is true, early Rush and the root of their success. Neil is the \\"new guy\\", so very easy to tell he hasn't worked out a lot of drum parts just yet, hate to say but even the meter goes up and down in some places, especially Working Man. Seems like he's looking at Geddy for the changes, while Alex is going off doing his own thing, not quite together just yet. Get this, during Working Man guitar solo, they go off and play a portion of Bytor and the Snowdog...just a taste of what's to come!  Hell yes!<br /><br />Don't be a fool, buy this bad boy! RUSH FANS ONLY!!

B008GJV4F2|5.0|This beautiful, sexy movie has a great story line and is one of Johnny Depp's finest works.  You will become a fan of Juliette Binoche!  Grap some chocolate and settle in.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love the Teacher novels and this one didn't disappoint.  It is not a difficult read at all fun and entertaining
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Kind of an interesting twist. Pretty badly edited though - ie.  bruises and cut on lincoln's face in one scense, next scene no cust or bruises, and then a following scene with cuts and bruises. All in all, however, I have paid for worse.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|Nice story and animation. Daughter enjoyed and Disney does a great job with the characters. Waiting for the next movie.
B0016OLC5Q|1.0|I didn't get to watch this.  Stuff came up that prevented me from watching this movie during my rental period...so I have no idea if it's a good movie or not.  So yeah, I wasted my time and money on this rental...wont be doing that again.
0451232852|4.0|As many of the other reviewers, I have a long history of enjoying Follett. This book extends that history but for me it didn't have the snap of some of his mysteries. One of the challenges of a historical novel is we do already know the \\"giant\\" outcome. I did feel that I learned enough of the WWI backgroud for it to pass my historical test. I was able to connect with his characters and I am hopeful that I will get more connected with their families in Winter of the World. All and all a good read, especially if you need to be able to put it down and not be comsumed by the story.
B001UV4XIS|1.0|It was boring.  The plot was trivial and there were no really fun or interesting scenes in the movie.  Thre were no peical effects or fun to watch scenes.
B0053O89IS|3.0|Bones Seventh Season was a short one so it was not as filling as others.  Some story lines closer to sci-fi than believable drama.
B005NFJAT4|4.0|It is unlikely that anyone anytime soon will recreate the battle of Gettysburg<br />in the stirring detail that Ron Maxwell did. This Blu-ray version<br />gives several scenes not in the theatrical release and that makes this version<br />important, historically. However, the difference in image quality between the original<br />DVD and this Blu-ray version is quite minor in my opinion. Buy this not mainly for Blu-ray<br />but for the expanded length and special features not seen in the original DVD release.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I really love this album.  At first it's hard to tell it's Hugh Laurie, but as soon as you pinpoint it, you can't get it out of your head.
B008BO61BE|5.0|Start off By Saying. If your a fan of Judas Priest Then there should be no reason to not own this 30th Anniversary Special. If You Don't Know Anything About Judas Priest and You enjoy Classic Heavy Metal. Then I Can't Think of a better CD to start you off with. Screaming for Vengence. Classic Priest Album. Hey You get the Bonus DVD of US Festival 83. Witch Kicks ASS. Well Your at it Buy the BRITISH STEEL 30th Anniversary Package Also.. Judas Priest (The Metal Gods) Must have for your Metal Collection. Oh one more thing. Audio Sounds Great. Good Job on The Remixing and Mastering...Rock On

1608871517|5.0|This book is an artistic masterpiece, beautiful pictures and incredible details about the conception of many of these beautiful original costumes. Michael wasn't just a genius of music but a genius of style! Buy this book whether or a Jackson fan or just interested in costume design.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I thought that some parts were pretty funny, but not as good as \\"Dog Days\\" and \\"The Ugly Truth\\" . It didn't really stand out from the series. The varying plot and constant changes makes book 7 the hardest to follow. Not Kinney's best work.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|This is possibly Michael Jackson's greatest concert! Here he is at his absolute prime and every song if 100% live which is astonishing as the dance routines are so energetic! Michael Jackson proves here why he was the greatest performer to EVER live! Brilliant concert.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book because of the story. I read this book before my kids to see if it was something I would approve of them reading. I will buy this book for them. I think its a good book for school kids.

B0071BGOJC|4.0|Having waited for the release of this book for ages I was not disappointed. The characters are not quite so easy to follow as in the first volume and the subject matter is a bit heavier ,however, it is still a jolly good read and the historical information is well interwoven into the story line as only Ken Follett knows how.I will certainly be reading book 3 when it comes out.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I recommended this extremely well written true story, Fearless, to each person on my e-mail list.<br />Loved it. Buy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Exciting story, brilliantly told. Couldn't put it down!  It reminds me of the Grisham of the \\"good old days\\".  Loved it.
0446580848|5.0|I check Demille's web site every few months to see if he has any new books out. To my surprise \\"Panther\\" was available for my kindle through his web site. How cool is that? If you liked Up Country and The Lion, you are going to love this book. Hands down this is the best book I have ever read.  Corey and Brenner in Yemen together on assignment? Brilliant. I loved every page.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a lot of fun! It is similar to Bejeweled but with a few added fun puzzles.The difficulty increases which makes it a good challenge.
B009YU62H2|5.0|If you haven't read the title of my review by this point, let me re-state that I am more of a Chris Cornell fan than anything else...with that being said, I feel as though I am coming into this review with a broad view of his work across the years and bands.<br /><br />For reference, I've always enjoyed more of his work with Audioslave; such as their debut, titled Audioslave and of course, Out of Exile...albums which still make up the majority of my playlist even to this day, alongside Cornell's acoustic masterpiece, \\"Songbook\\".<br /><br />For me, Soundgarden will always hold a special place. Unfortunately, since I first heard Cornell's work with Audioslave, it's been slightly difficult to return to Soundgarden's work with the same enthusiasm.<br /><br />The album as a whole is solid and if you're a returning Soundgarden fan, you will not be disappointed. However, I have a few personal \\"flaws\\" to point out that go back to the points I presented above:<br /><br />Let me being by saying that I've always found Soundgarden's biggest flaw to be their overpowering style. A trend I was hoping would not repeat itself more than ten years later...it sort of did. As with previous recordings, a few singles seem to lack flow and as I previously pointed out, the lyrics tend to be drowned by the heavy guitar work across the board...this however, is not necessarily a bad thing, as King Animal's instrumentals are some of the best I've heard in years and thoroughly surpass that of the original works by the band.<br /><br />As I continue to write this review, I can being to imagine what many of you have been thinking as you've read along...and yes, it's time for me to point out the obvious: My biggest problem with Soundgarden is that they're not Audioslave. Personally, that comes down to the lyrics, as I've yet to find anything as remotely powerful as \\"Like a Stone\\", \\"Show Me How to Live\\", \\"Yesterday to Tomorrow\\" or \\"Out of Exile\\" in their lineup.<br /><br />I came into King Animal hoping to find a continuation to what was abandoned eight years ago and obviously, I didn't find what I was looking for. However, that is rather a flaw that belongs with me and not King Animal itself.<br /><br />The album is Soundgarden's best work yet and it is time for me to appreciate it for what it is, a gem.
B003VWU2WA|1.0|After taking to thier tech support for an hour I have come to find out that this company is junk. Griffin tech had told me that they have no plans on makeing this compatible for win 7.

B001I45UFC|5.0|This was one of my favorite books as a kid, and still reads just as good now that I'm an adult.
B005DNO7MQ|5.0|I thought this movie was amazing! Russell Crowe's performance was breathtaking and I was completely engrossed in the movie the entire time. Also, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is great! I would highly recommend this movie to anyone (although not for little kids, as there is a lot of stabbing. There is actually not too much gore though.)But definitely worth a watch, if not several!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I really have enjoyed this series of novels, and still tore through this one.  As much as I love the dialogue and internally commented humor, their plot adventure on this book was what I was expecting.  DeMille is a talented author, however he needs to embrace a new style of adventure for these two.  There is a lot of life left in the characters and a more diverse place, setting, or bad guy is in order.  Also, the blending in of another character from his other series (The Generals Daughter/North Country) did not play out as well as I had hoped.  It is difficult to have two alpha males in writing I'm sure, but he had to betray the character style of Brenner to pull it off.  (All in my opinions anyway)  I am still glad I purchased it, and it did provide a wonderful three day read to break up life.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|Great quality. Arrived earth and no.scratches and the description matched the product. Will suggest to others for their future purchases
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I loved this book.  I cannot wait for the White Princess.  Truth is always more interesting and strange and outlandish than fiction.
B009VB998I|5.0|I loved every seasons of the film. It was beautifully written and expressed so many lessons that I know I will carry on into my future.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Very strange concept for a movie, but the stars pull it off and the non-stars made it an enjoyable experience!
1938469003|3.0|This was a decent book, with really good recipes at the end.<br /><br />However, if you just want brewing techniques and recipes as I did, the first 250 or so pages were pretty much useless.  It talks a lot about the history of IPAs, but I found the subject pretty boring and quickly found myself just skipping to the end.  That being said, the last few chapters and recipes were all very interesting.  I've tried two of the recipes so far, and they're both better than the previous half dozen I got online.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|No regrets renting it or spending my time watching it.<br /><br />The streaming was flawless with HD picture quality consistant.  I was sitting 8 feet from an 8 foot screen and it looked great from start to finish.<br /><br />The movie itself was not so flawless but I enjoyed it because I was not holding it to high standards as far as what I think people would do in a given situation or what the laws of physics are, etc.  This had the logic typical to almost every horror movie, but without the horror.  The characters on the ship were really too untrained and stupid to be in the jobs they were in. All of this is sort of typical of most big budget movies now.<br /><br />It was a bit slow by today's standards but kept flowing at an acceptable pace. I liked that this was a prequel to the original Alien movie but was also a bit disappointed because they could've done so much better with it.  Despite its flaws, I was in the mood to watch a movie like this and glad I rented it.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This is a great series a little for everyone.My wife didnt think she would like it but she is hooked.We have watched the first four seasons and can't wait for season five.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very well written and keeps your attention.  Very provacitive.  I don't normally read this kind of book but it is very good.
B007EECSFA|5.0|A great book! I could not wait to get to the next chapter to find out what was going to happen to the characters and all the various story lines. A well written book that I did not want to put down!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Fresh, new effects. Loved the horse scene. Nice not to have a lot of nudity, like I'm most vampire movies.
1469984202|5.0|Before buying a book, especially from an author I'm unfamiliar with, I'll skip to the 1 star reviews. If you've done that with \\"Wool\\", you'll note that the reviews talk of the book being slow moving or excessively depressing. I was pleasantly surprised that it was neither. It was enjoyable and the ending was uplifting.<br /><br />The most favorable reviews had compared it with \\"Dune\\" - having read \\"Wool\\", I'm not sure what the overlap is, other than they are both very enjoyable books.  \\"Wool\\" reminded me more of \\"Gormenghast\\" - but much more upbeat and quicker moving. (This doesn't say much as most novels are in comparison to Gormenghast...).<br /><br />I normally take note of problematic, misleading, or inaccurate elements of novels. I found none which bothered me with \\"Wool\\".<br /><br />In conclusion, it's quite a good read and well worth the purchase.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have been waiting a year to continue this story and have not been disapointed.the writer definately keeps your interest.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham keeps you entertain and has several twistes. Worth while reading as most of his books. Racketeer is worth full price.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Born into This......Born Yesterday......Born in the USA....... Born to Run.....Born to be Wild...... Born to Lose...... and then......Born to Die. All of these titles to uniquely American songs and poetry with their psychological blues and themes are what \\"Lana Del Rey\\" is offering to the Gods.<br /><br />This is one the most beautiful records produced by an (new) American artist in a long while. Her torch song delivery mixed with all of the 'big\\" modern sounds of today, goes right for the heart....and the throat. Make no mistake about it, this young woman is an artist and if she never makes another album she has delivered to the listening public an album of truth and beauty and depth, through the medium of \\"pop\\" music. This has got a great sound with melodies and lyrics that stay in your mind.<br /><br />A deep well of young/female desolation and sadness tinged with toughness and desire is present in her music. Her voice and style resonate with American mythical culture and a nostalgic longing.... Gorgeous!<br /><br /> Her videos are very good and the new one, \\"Ride\\" (the long story version) is even better than anything else from this album. This video is one of the best ever made about the dark heart of the \\"American Dream\\". Musically, visually and psychologically stunning.....David Lynch should be proud to have influenced this artist.<br /><br />Deep meaning.....deep as the search for life and love....and deep as death.
B002BWP49C|2.0|This is the kind of stuff that makes you think our cultures are killing off the last bastion of good taste. This stuff is reprehensible day time soap garbage. Not a damn thing worth saying here except that people who yearn for this stuff and live for it need to be dumped on an island. Cull the herd. I cannot even believe this is what is popular with kids today. Why? Because marketing, TV, and whatever the hell else have convinced these morons that this is what they want and need. Never has their been a time of worst taste in the mainstream except the mid 80s. Never. Even then it was forgivable as the decade was pretty much lost anyway. We should know better. The TV has inundated people with this stuff and their minds are so vacant and susceptible that they think these kinds of films and books are somehow any good. The acting is awful, the direction pitiful, and the whole thing just reeks of cold-hearted sleaze.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|We thought this would be kind of a bore, but it proved to be quite enjoyable.  Wife and I stayed awake the entire movie, with great rolls played by excellent actors...I think most all will enjoy.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Some really good life lessons about living in the moment.  Setting dreams or goals, but looking for happiness on the road to that dream.  That is where we find true happiness, on the road to the dream, not in achieving the dream.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|Someone needs to adapt this into a musical to rival \\"Evil Dead - The Musical.\\" The twist on the point of view is brilliant and the light-hearted story is a great contract to the grizzly gore.
B00005N6KG|5.0|For the price, this is a great headphone to use with an iphone or while exercising.  It's design fits the ear very comfortably, is very light and you could wear it all day without discomfort.  When using it with an iphone the headphone uses the microphone in the phone.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had a real hard time getting into girl gone. I like books that grab me from the beginning.It was dissapointing.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|My current kindle 3 charger started disintegrating. When I contacted amazon customer support about this, they sent me a new one for FREE! But it has SUPER slow shipping. I ordered this like, before halloween and it is still not here, so I can't finish my game of Battleship on my kindle.

B009329ZF2|4.0|As a Navy veteran i enjoyed the naval aspects of this movie.  The Sci-Fi portion was also great.  Very intense and \\"edge of the seat\\" action.  Only complaint is the aliens destroyed two of the three main turrets on the Mighty Mo but after that scene, she was still using two of her main turrets!  Minor, I know.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|In my opinion this album is one of the best from Deftones so far, very powerful riffs, pretty good lyrics too... A must buy for every metal, alternative or whatever you want to call it fan!!!
B008XCM18Q|4.0|I had been waiting for this book to be available for Kindle and downloaded it with great anticipation. I did enjoy the book and in some areas did not want to put it down, Ludlum certainly spins an interesting tale, but I'm not sure I like his style. It could be a bit wordy at times. Overall an enjoyable read.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|good graphics great game very addictive play is fast data easy to understand, some levels are quite hard but still lots of fun.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|I came across this book by &#34;The Happiness Advantage quite by accident.  I liked it so well that I am recommending it to everyone I know including my family.  As the saying goes &#34;it's a must read&#34;.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I missed the first season so I bought it when it came out on DVD. I was hooked! I love this show!
B00650SSDU|5.0|If you are looking for a romantic comedy I would recommend.  Love the humor, love the city, good use of today's society (flash mobs :)
B002RT2BXQ|4.0|Reading this novel changed my life.  it gave me the license that it was okay for me to be my unique self.  it was a major catalyst to prompt me to separate myself from the sheeple.  i think it hits on some of the biggest problems in our society.  ayn rand, author of the novel, had escaped from communist russia and fully embraced the principles of capitalism, but she saw more deeply into the values of integrity and principles of individualism.  in my opinion, her philosophy, when taken to an extreme is no less dangerous than the problems of communism.  it is all about balance.  having said that, i think her message is even more important (toward bringing a balance) today than it was when she wrote her most progressive novel.  this is a deep film.  it will appear trivial for anyone who is not willing to explore the very deep and provocative intellectual stimulation it offers.  movies almost never seem to measure up to the written works they might be based upon and (imo) this film does no better than most, but it brings the real pearls from ayn rand to anyone who is ready to receive them.  for example, cary grant, great actor that he was, just comes across as much more polished of a character than i depicted howard roark in reading the book.  i have always associated howard roark's character with bob dylan.
B008S4FZHI|1.0|The book is full of page after page of details on the collecting of evidence and undertaking an autopsy. It get very boring after a while. There is very little real detection going on. If yu have read many of the Scarpetta novels you will be disappointed with this book. The energy and originality of the early books is no longer in evidence in this new novel. This has been true for the past few books. We need a new direction for Scarpetta. I would not like to see the characters disappear but hey need invigorating.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Keeps ones interest and sets up suspence It drags a little in the middle where the psuedo documentary with Nathan is being filmed. That is where I am at now.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Great great film everyone should see it fantastic from start to finish! I highly recomend this film! Great for the whole family!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was great, just like the other two. Only wish there would be at least one more!! It would br awesome to have more of Christian's view.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good read. The novel is fast paced, holds your interest and is hard to put down. It is not your typical Grisham. The story has great characters and an unusual plot with many twists and turns. I enjoyed the book.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan Boyle is one of the best singers performing today. I would give Susan Boyle a standing ovation for every song on this disc.  She sparks my interest in  watching all these classic productions on stage again.  My favorite track is Susan's duet with Donny Osmond. This song is entitled \\"All I Ask You\\".  This song is from The Phantom Of The Opera. Their voices compliment each other beautifully.  This classic song is very romantic. \\"This Is The Moment\\" is another great duet song from the the musical Jekyll and Hyde.  I have never heard of this song before buying this CD.  This song is very uplifting.  This song reminds me that I can make any moment special.  \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\"  gives me hope that I will always have someone to lean on in tough times.  \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" is a song that features lovely piano playing. This song encourages me to dream and to work hard to make my dreams come true.  \\"Bring Him Home\\" is a song about the love for another person.  This is a great song Les Miserables. Susan Boyle has the ability to make any song her own.  She does this with the song \\"Out Here On My Own\\". This is a song about self reliance. This song also reminds me that people depend on each other to survive. \\"Send In The Clowns\\" is a song that simply gives me hope that a better day is just on the horizon.  I love the music on this disc.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this app. it relax me when I am going to sleep.Its help me a lot. thanks for this app
B0002KZAKS|5.0|I use this mic with a home recording studio ran through my pc. In hindsight, a condenser mic would have been better, as dynamic mics are better suited for live performances, but it does the trick and as long as you know how to adjust mic levels in Windows it's not an issue. It does record a bit on the low side even with the mic recording level turned completely up, though, but this isn't bad as I sing quietly, so it's my own fault. Would recommend with 5 stars.
B00756GRUE|4.0|This watch had one of the worse strap, to alter the strap size, one must be very careful to look out for a small metal piece that is slot onto the pin. I had alot of effort spend to alter the watch, thinking that it is as easy as my rest of the seiko watches. Overall nice looking design, only the alter of strap piss me off. For people slack of patience, it will be best to bring to wath shop to get it alter before it ruined your day.
B0041VC13I|5.0|A must-have album for anyone claiming to be a metal fan. This is the first album Pantera released after it changed its image from a glam-rock band to something a little more sinister ;)
B007WULJ5G|4.0|not for the normal person.But if you like extreme, this is it.Violence,nudity and sickness.This movie has it all.Not for the squimish,so know what you are getting into.

B008GFI418|2.0|This George Martin DVD was very slow moving, but interesting. I was able to get two naps in during this video. It did not go into as much detail with the Beatles as I had hoped for. It was also difficult to understand alot of the British dialect even with captions. I cannot tell you to run right out and buy this one like I did.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A sci-fi story second, an insight into thinking strategically first! Not surprised this book is on the required reading list at the US military's officer training center.
1938469003|5.0|Having read numerous brewing books, of both instructional, historic, and recipe this is a great combination of all three. Instead of trying to weave history with recipes and historical technique, the book is nicely divided into three main sections. History, technique & ingredients, recipes.<br />While the historic information may be not be terribly exciting, it's good to see the myth of IPA name corrected. It's also great to see so many recipes for amazing IPA's in one book. There is a large section dedicate to brewing techniques, and ingredients for IPA's. Recipes are from Russian River, DogfishHead, The Alchemist, Hill Farmstead, Avery, etc. As an avid homebrewer I can't wait to put a few of these recipes to the test, and use techniques to improve my existing hoppy ales.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|The movie is excellent for kids. The book is a classic book by Roald Dahl [[ASIN:0142410373 Matilda]]. After reading the book, we saw the movie and it is very good. Mathilda is a genius kid but her dad and mom could not identify it. It is a very gripping story which ends in a very telling way. everyone will enjoy the movie - it has everything - humor, seriousness, very melodramatic.
0062127241|3.0|Overall, I enjoyed reading this book.  I don't give it more than 3 stars because of some strange omissions.  I found it odd that Townshend didn't write much about how Keith Moon's death affected the band members.  He wrote a bit more about John Entwistle's death but again didn't give much insight as to how it affected the remaining band members.<br /><br />A couple of other omissions are other examples of mentioning events and places and not carrying through with a bit of explanation.  In the beginning of the chapter \\"Growing into my skin\\", he mentions playing at San Francisco's Winterland, calling it \\"a venue I adored\\".  In my teenage years and into my 20s, I saw many shows at Winterland and also adored the old building.  I would like to have read from Townshend what it was about Winterland that he adored from a touring musician's perspective.<br /><br />The second omission that I found odd was the episode early in the Quadrophenia tour of 1973 at the Cow Palace in San Francisco.  He mentions Moon passing out on stage and gives it one paragraph.  What he failed to mention was that the Who finished the show after calling out for someone in the audience who could play the drums well.  A local guy in the audience filled in for Moon to finish the show.  To me, not even mentioning that part of what happened was a glaring omission.<br /><br />Other readers may think that I'm being overly critical on those omissions.  They were only two of many incidents that were only briefly covered.  Even though I liked the book overall, I think it could have been much better and debated giving it only 2 stars.  Diehard Who fans will probably love the book.  If you want to read a really good autobiography of a rocker, skip Who I Am and instead read Life by Keith Richards.
159448385X|5.0|This is written in such a simple, beautiful and effective style, and the story is sure to stay with you well after you finish it.
B00973902K|5.0|Heard this song on the radio at work and decided to download it. Its a fun song, and the video on Youtube has a cute story to it. I also read the lyrics before I bought it.
0783231032|5.0|Having seen this movie many years ago, it came back to my mind and I looked it up at Amazon.com and I found it as with other movies I ordered in the past. A very funny movie with some realy good stars in it. Sadly several of them left us. But still it is great to sit back and watch it again. I recommend it especialy now on Veterans day. Enjoy it.<br />[[ASIN:0783231032 1941 (Collector's Edition)]]
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I haven't read any of the authors books for awhile, because I didn't like a couple he wrote that were out of the lawyer genre.  I was delighted with this book and think it is his best so far.  What a clever plot.
1476715904|5.0|Is one of the best funniest love stories ever written. I love the heartache the young couples had to do to get to the point of the book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ducks when you run out of points. make a way to get more points.  or give more points for winning games.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|A great book for anyone 10 to 15 its a very fun book I have every book and the last three are my favorite
B009VB9VKY|2.0|Hate seeing good feeds unreturned in movie and frustrate you but ends poorly . Too graphic in some areas. Girl could have acted better and been better fit for main actor.
0718154770|4.0|Better than good cookbook with fine pictures of prepared food.  Unless one has three back-up helpers, however, one might find it difficult to prepare some of these meals in 30 minutes.  However, there were excellent ideas to move things along in the kitchen.  My chief problem was understanding the 'measurements' ...a 'lug' of olive oil??  And, yes, I did go online to find a translation for his terminology, but 'lug' wasn't one of them.  Is it Cockney--shades of 'My Fair Lady\\"?  The pizza recipe was so-so, but Jamie as  much admitted that it was not the real thing.  On the other hand,  it encouraged me to find the 'real thing' and learn how to make pizza dough, so the effort was worth it. (And for what it is worth,  making real pizza dough is almost easier.) Altogether, the book is an enjoyable read and I will attempt additional recipes.
0061726834|5.0|I loved this book.  It took me a little while to get into the story, but once I did, I was hooked.  I'm not sure I like the sequel- I think this book is just perfect as is as a stand-alone novel.  Lauren Oliver has a way with words that makes prose like poetry.
B003O86FMW|2.0|Can't  wait to finish the trilogy Ms Collins has quite an imagination I give the book 5 stars. Thank you
B004YM6JLO|5.0|In my opinion, at least.  I love the Vampire Diaries.  This series has the most interesting story arcs where no villain is really a villian and every good-guy makes bad decisions, too.  For a show about the supernatural, this is one of the most human series on TV.  I tune in every week & am excited to own the seasons for re-watching.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Being film geeks, my husband and I actually watched all the Alien movies (except the versus predators ones) prior to watching this so we would have a full, current understanding of all that had happened throughout the story.  We thought this would give us a good base to watch this one letting it answer all our questions on where the aliens actually originated from.  A bit of a waste of time as watching this movie actually gave us more questions than answers.  Is there going to be another one?  As, in my opinion there needs to be to fill the gap where this movie ended and the original Alien movie started.<br /><br />Stand alone it was quite a good watch.  Noomi Rapace (Lisbeth Salander from the original foreign language Girl with a Dragon Tattoo) is a good actress.  She does need to work on her British accent as she started the movie herself (and the child version of her) with a very broad, posh English accent but ended up speaking in accented English, a small criticism but one that can ruin a great movie for me.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is another favourite actor of mine but he just didn't work very well in his role in this movie.  He was obviously a young man trying to play an old man.  Just no need for that given the number of great older actors out there that would have fitted the bill so well.<br /><br />Like I said, so many more questions which let the movie down but I won't list them here as they are spoilers for the story.<br /><br />I wouldn't rush out to watch this but it did pass a couple of hours in a quite entertaining way.  I hope there is another one to answer my questions.
B00471TLZS|5.0|One of few I have rated a perfect 10 on IMDb, the others being Rosemary's Baby and a couple others out of 3000 or so titles I've rated.<br /><br />I saw Poltergeist in theaters in 1982, and watching it any time since then it's just as good... emotionally, maybe moreso, knowing the tragic end of Heather O'Rourke... she was so adorable in this movie.<br /><br />My friend Mike really sums it best when he said,<br /><br />\\"The television has an interesting role in that movie. Perhaps the first time that a tv was utilized almost as a main character/antagonist. There are other more subtle subversive themes going on as well, picturing suburbia and the American Dream as an encroachment upon sacred elements.\\"<br /><br />Poltergeist has some of the most heartfelt, honest, heartbreaking, wonderful dialog, you just don't get such honest and stirring dialog like that anymore.<br /><br />The music is haunting and beautiful, directing is amazing and immersive, the horror is palpable, but never over used, the other side never shown too much to destroy the mystery, tension or fear... incredible pacing, with one of the best comedic levity-filled endings that just works out of any horror ever made.<br /><br />Truly a masterpiece<br /><br />10/10 without question.
1451662432|5.0|but I did enjoy the book....learned a lot about his background...<br /><br />He is a real &#34;go getter&#34; willing to set goals and achieve them
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I received this very promptly.  the price is excellent.  The quality of the DVD is excellent.  Product is just as described.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|5 Stars for<br />- corey's sense of humour and skewed morality, I laughed couple of times<br />- very well written and researched
B00908DDZM|4.0|Let me just say that I'm not a long time Macklemore fan. I got into him about eleven months ago when I heard \\"Wings\\" for the first time, but I was hooked instantly. After seven years Macklemore hooked up with Ryan Lewis to release his second full length studio album. I must say, considering all the attention he's received because of the XXL Freshman List, I wasn't expecting this project to be so pure. In many ways it mirrors his debut album, The Language of My World. It has conscious/positive songs like \\"Same Love,\\" fun songs like \\"Thrift Shop,\\" and personal songs like \\"Starting Over.\\"<br /><br />The main difference is the production. While The Language of My World contained more of a raw Hip Hop sound, Ryan Lewis chose to create a sound that's more universal. After hearing The Language of My World for the first time it was weird when I heard such a different sound and, at first, it kind of put me off. However, when you listen to the album as a whole the production works beautifully with Macklemore's lyrics and it's dope that each beat is so unique and different, yet they complement each other so well.<br /><br />Even though songs like \\"Wings\\" & \\"Can't Hold Us\\" were released earlier last year they don't seem dated compared to the newer songs. In fact, hearing them mixed with these new songs gives them a \\"fresh\\" feeling. While we're discussing particular songs I need to give Macklemore props on the two singles he released this year. Every time \\"Thrift Shop\\" comes on I can't help but start dancing. That's saying something because I don't dance at all, but that song is so fun and exciting it's hard not to. The other single was \\"Same Love.\\" I know some people would say it was a way to garner attention, but I feel like it was genuine and from the heart. It's an important topic that needs to be discussed and what better place to do that than in Hip Hop?<br /><br />Even though this album is filled with some amazing songs there were a few missteps. To be more specific, \\"White Walls\\" and \\"Gold.\\" I didn't enjoy anything about those two songs. A couple of other tracks that didn't hold up to the rest of this album were \\"Ten Thousand Hours,\\" \\"Thin Line\\" & \\"Cowboy Boots.\\" While I feel \\"Ten Thousand Hours\\" isn't necessarily a bad song, and I agree it had to be placed at the beginning, I feel the album doesn't really start until track two \\"Can't Hold Us.\\" \\"Thin Line\\" was one of those songs where I loved it some listens and hated it during others, and I felt \\"Cowboy Boots\\" was a terrible way to end the album. In my opinion \\"Starting Over\\" would have been a stronger ending song. Like I said these songs weren't terrible, but they were weaker in comparison to the rest of the album.<br /><br />The only other gripe I have with this album is the amount of guests. There's a total of 15 songs, with 11 of them having a guest of some sort. Now 90% of them only provide hook support, but still. His solo debut had 20 songs and only five of them had guests. So he doesn't need hook support, he's perfectly capable of doing them himself.<br /><br />The bonus songs are ok. \\"My Oh My\\" and \\"Victory Lap\\" were both released prior to this album's release, the only new song being \\"Castle.\\" \\"Castle\\" is more of a commercial/dance type of song. While it's not bad, it isn't anything to brag about either. The strongest of these three songs would have to be \\"My Oh My.\\"<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"Thrift Shop,\\" \\"Same Love,\\" \\"Jimmy Iovine,\\" & \\"Starting Over\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8.5/10 - Considering he's gained all this attention this past year, it's nice to see that he stayed true to himself on this record. He could have done a better job at trimming the fat, but it's hard to bash this album too much when it's filled with some really amazing material. If you're a fan of Hip Hop or you're looking for an album filled with both fun and positive music, I would recommend you give this a listen.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I love most all the Reacher books and this was a good one.  It appears though that many aspects of the Reacher novels are the same from book to book.  In many cases that is what makes the reading good (almost obsession with coffee, buying basic clothing, etc.).
B004LWZW7E|5.0|I caught part of this movie on cable TV and was so thankful that they had an encore presentation immediately so I could enjoy the whole movie.  I think the plot line of the movie was very interesting - time as currency - for an action movie.  The acting was superb and it holds your interest throughout the entire movie.
0803726570|5.0|This is a wonderful children's book and a delight to read.  I first read it with my granddaughter in her home and fell in love with it.  I smiled each time I read it with her so  I decided  to purchase four more books  to give to my other grandchildren. They all loved it too!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie over and over again and for many years.  I never seem to tire of it - it still is as funny as when I saw it the first time.  The actors do an exceptional job.  This is an entertaining movie - a stretch from reality - but one of my favorites that I can watch repeatedly and still appreciate the humor of the situation.  I think it is timeless and would be appreciated by teens and adults alike.  Never in anyone's imagination would faking an illness to skip school have this much adventure.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Awesome from beginning to end. Action Packed good story line really had us thinking about the gettysburg war. A must see!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I applauded this movie in the theater and now enjoy it at home. I love that the story was told.  It saddens me to think of how poorly we once treated people.  I haven't read the book, but the movie is one of my favorite drama movies.  The acting is superior, the story one that we can readily identify with, and the humor and tears genuine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this app a lot.  Fun game that keeps you thinking and guessing.  Try it out and you will enjoy!
0822208385|5.0|Excellent condition, easy to use in preparation for my part in the Spring show &#34;Of Mice and Men&#34;. Small enough as well to carry with me.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Like most reviewers, I enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book tremendously. I actually liked that all of the characters were perfectly despicable and I loved the back and forth storytelling style (it kept me turning pages into the night). The way Flynn writes about the many tiny ways we destroy ourselves and our relationships amasses to a spot-on cautionary tale for couples.<br /><br />But the ending sucks. It doesn't suck so much that I regret ever picking the book up, but it does suck so much I won't recommend it to anyone else.<br /><br />The author spends 400 pages demonstrating the ways in which the two main characters are basically the worst human beings to walk the earth...then drops the bomb that they're going to make a third (probably horribly toxic) human being and wraps up the book in about 20 pages? WHAT?! I want justice! I want vindication -- at least for Nick! Don't we deserve that? It's one thing to sentence Nick and Amy to have to spend the rest of their miserable lives together, but to add a helpless baby to the mix is just terribly, horribly, cripplingly sad and unfair.<br /><br />I can think of ten alternate endings that would have been more satisfying: Amy in jail, Amy buried in the back yard, Amy drowning herself, Nick in jail, Amy kills nick, Go snaps and kills them both, EVEN IT'S ALL AN EFFING STORY OR DREAM OR DAD'S CRAZY HALLUCINATION! EVEN THAT! GAH!<br /><br />I'm strongly disinclined from reading any of Flynn's other books now, which makes me sad, because I really like her writing.

0553801473|2.0|No spoilers here<br /><br />The books go downhill all the way, so don't expect much of this one. I became a fan with the first and I'm trying to still be a fan, but it's really hard.<br /><br />Expect each chapter to go into details of superfulous things, to be repeatable, and, worst of all, boring. In this last book the author has started to spend a lot of words in useless drama and finishing the chapter when something really happens. Then he skips all the things that happened so you go forward in time to when someone is remembering what happened. Boring and tedious.<br /><br />Another important thing is that the author also goes to the next level in sexual references. And the repetitive use of phrases and words also is tiresome.<br /><br />If you find a book that summirizes this one, get it. This book can be made to two pages per chapter easily. The rest is useless... and boring boring boring.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Another fantastic book from the crossfire series. Can't wait for the next one. If you liked fifty shades you will love this. I couldn't put it down.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|I got this app because I was doing a spa day for my friends and it worked perfectly.I wish they had more sounds and the were more music realated sounds. either way its a good app.
B002VECM6S|5.0|There's a reason why I loved it so much, apart from the fact that it is a very good movie, filled with believable scenes and characters.  I have a Zambian foster daughter, far from the character in the blind side, but someone who has helped me view life in Zambia in a way I couldn't have otherwise.  Sandra Bullock was superb in the film.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|It can be said the life story of Susan Boyle is an inspiration to those who know her best, but by all accounts, Susan Boyle is an inspiration to untold millions of people worldwide. It's as if her sudden rise to stardom after appearing on the television reality show Britain's Got Talent was meant to be, if not a dream come true.<br /><br />Now with the prominence of a top ranked seasoned professional, best-selling albums, and top of the chart success covering five continents in over twenty countries, once again she is destined to sing her way into the hearts of millions. Some may find it ironic knowing it all began with the song I Dreamed a Dream.<br /><br />Susan Boyle's three earlier albums I Dreamed A Dream, The Gift & Someone To Watch Over Me are all popular, easy listening vocal albums loved by an constantly increasing fan base that spans the globe.<br /><br />Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From The Stage is the newest album by Susan Boyle, due to be released on November 13, 2012. Her newest release is a compilation of classic songs, and as the album subtitle suggests, are 11 favorite songs performed in the theater and some of the greatest movies ever produced.<br /><br />One day prior to the release of her new album on November 13, 2012 Susan Boyle appeared on NBC's Today Show Concert Series, and performed the Abba cover song The Winner Takes It All. If you listened to her sing live for the first time it was a beautiful introduction.<br /><br />For the millions of people who know her story and have listened to the soprano sing, simply discovering the talents of Susan Boyle has been the shared moment of victory uniting us all.  Original review from newagemusicworld.com
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book I recommend you read all of Martins books on Game of Thrones, these book keep you in it from start to finish,
B001TODCII|5.0|I love this movie! Liam Neesom is a great actor and this is one of his finest movies. Great suspense!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Well written and engaging look at the neurbiology and behavior behind habit development, change and maintenance.  I am thoroughly enjoying the read.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Extremely well written.  I got a little lost in the scientifice jargon - however I understand how the author had to include it in order to stress that before his experience he was strictly a man of science.  The bottom line is, he's still a man of science and a doctor, but with a much broader knowledge of how our soul plays into the equation.  As someone whose brother had a near death experience, I found this book to be fascinating, insightful, and most of all, even more reason that I'm not afraid to die.  Although I have no intention of rushing my \\"transition.\\"  Well done, sir!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Plot and special effects held promise for this prequel to Aliens but everything got muddled in the middle and the ending made no sense.
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|Many of the other reviews lay out the programming that is contained in this set and describe its packaging. I just wanted to add that the set sounds magnificent and many of Bernstein's interpretations of these pieces remain unmatched half a century after they were first recorded. I especially enjoy his Ives, Copland, Bartok, and Nielson. The set is worth the price for the Mahler alone, and the booklet included is informative and useful. This is a beautiful set, and for those who do not have a great deal of Bernstein, a marvelous bargain.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have a kindel fire and I love survival mode<br />at first you don't like it so much but once you know how to play its awesome
B00846REIS|4.0|I truly enjoyed the first two books.  I hate that I have to wait for the final book in the series.  I think the authors shouldn't release books unless they have all of them ready.  But I really did enjoy the two first books...& will be getting the third as soon as it is out.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Once again DeMille has Mr. John Corey at his cynical best. The story line is relevant and believable. The cultural and personal differences between our country and Yemen are brought to understandable light. Mr. Corey has a unique wit and perspective which is sharp and often time very amusing. The plot to take down the Panther is enjoyable and is filled with enough 180 reasoning and doubt to keep the reader wondering what will go wrong and when.
B00843TZJM|5.0|Excepionaly great blu-ray dvd . picture quality is fantastic ,and the concert itself is fantastic with the three great voices in perfect harmony ., a very good selection of songs. DONT MISS IT.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I really find this to be my most used app. I use it twice a day during the week. The only problem is now I can do math in my sleep and it doesn't always wake me up anymore.
B008OOYALE|5.0|fun game, but everything costs a lot, and the prices get worse as you get to higher and higher levels.
B00466HM28|3.0|For 60 dollars I can't complain. The keys do seem toyish. The drum pads are not as responsive as you would want and while the piano keys do feel somewhat weighted the material is thin and they flex. I just got it for extra midi controller inputs. I use it secondary to a midi mixer and for that it is great.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I don't buy a lot of shows in DVD because one I've watched them, I'm done and don't really need to see them again. But with Walking Dead, I feel like every time rewatch an episode I notice something I didn't catch before. Great show
B007SSEZNA|4.0|Enjoyable faithful screen adaptation to the classic Jane Austen favorite. Paltrow has just the right mix of innocence and mischief. I watched this on my Kindle Fire, loved it.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I normally don't like zombie flicks, but tits show if so much more than that, which is what makes it so amazing. Definitely worth watching
B009GYSQV6|5.0|This album speaks to me and touches me on a level that not many things in my life have ever managed.<br /><br />The album as a whole is completely perfect and surpassed all of my expectations.<br /><br />CC seems to have streamlined their sound and opted to make a more emotional piece of art. There were songs that came close to moving me to tears (Wrath Of God, Child I Will Hurt You).<br /><br />The theme of the album, the artwork and the presentation all blend together and create an experience that quite honestly left my jaw on the floor.<br /><br />It's as if this recording is haunted by ghosts.
0446580848|1.0|Impossible to read, 600 pages and nothing except traveling hotels and Yemen--the biggest disappointment in 20 years.  As bad or word than Joe Nesbo and the drug trade in OSLO (who cares).  How in gods name did Demille get 600 words about crap. Amazon, I want my money back.
0307730697|5.0|This is a very motivating and emotionally moving book about a true American hero. A must read for every American and a motivational resource for any man working towards becoming a Navy SEAL. RIP Chief Brown
1401937268|5.0|The cards are amazing I love the art work and the positive reinforcement she uses. I found that everyone I have done a reading for was pleased. I am always accurate and there is no doubt that the directions and the booklet help.
B009VB7P6G|3.0|My daughter isn't that interested the Disney fairies to warrant buying it so the 48-hour online rental was cool.  Movie was better than the other Fairy movies (in my opinion). I don't think my 4-yr old likes the Fairy stories enough to care which is better but she did watch the whole movie.<br /><br />I do stream some free Prime videos and rarely pay but wanted to watch this (I'm a big Disney fan). Not related to this movie but I would be prefer some kind of \\"2 time\\" deal instead of 48-hours. I think it'd be more useful for us to watch it again (with another kid) later in the week than watching it again in same 48-hour span.  I like to preview some movies before I let her watch and also she often doesn't feel like finishing it so we don't always get back to TV within 48 hours to finish.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read every Nelson DeMille book and really enjoyed most of them. I didn't enjoy this one because of the incessant and excessive wisecracks of John Corey (the hero). Most were Greek Chorus type internal conversations with himself. You soon saw the pattern and knew another one was coming after virtually every utterance by Corey or whomever tried to communicate with him. He's not really that funny.<br />I suspect the book would be half as long without them.<br />And all this without a lot of action going on in the book.<br />Very disappointed.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Good stuff.  Forces you to use and stretch your imagination.  Interesting concept and very involving from the first page on.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I've heard of this book all my life but decided to read it.<br /><br />Polyanna has this way of getting under even the most kermudgeonly individuals and changes their attitudes for the positive.<br /><br />When Polyanna suffers an accident and is laid up in the hosiptal her positive attitude has its worst test but >spoiler&lt; she comes out of it and is just as good as before.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I have authored a couple of (non-fiction) books, so I am always looking out for something that I might learn more about marketing and publishing.<br /><br />I have read many kindle books on the subject of \\"Selling books on Kindle\\", and I was getting to the point of not bothering any further, because they were all very slight variations of the same advice. However I persevere, knowing that one good idea amid the dross has the potential to sifnificantly improve my performance.<br /><br />When I saw John Locke's book, I figured it would be worth checking out as I had heard of John. My only reservation is that I had not read his books, and I knew he was an author of fiction rather than non-fiction.<br /><br />My fears were totally unfounded. It wasn't until I read the book that I found out John was a successful businessman before starting to write, and we were definitely on the same wavelength.<br /><br />This is one of the most 'highlighted' books on my Kindle.<br /><br />The marketing power of 'Loyalty Transfer' and the correct use of Twitter, was a revelation to me, and was worth 100 times the price of this book. -I should know I have paid that much and more for courses and seminars that have delivered less!<br /><br />The book is short. It is easy to read. The techniques he describes are very powerful.<br />This book will not go down well with many writers I know, who are in love with the craft of writing.<br />But as a marketer myself, I find this book genius!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good read; well paced; good plot; John and Paul Brenner working together.  If you enjoy Nelson DeMille, you will love this one.
B005NFW0U0|3.0|My wife had to talk me into watching this show at first. Once I got to know the characters in season one it was good enough that she did not have to twist my arm into watching it anymore. I have watched season 2 and season 3 is looking to be the best one yet! Really good show!
0451232852|5.0|Book was an excellent work.  It was well researched.  To some degree, the book might have been a bit too long.  As I read closer to the end, I found myself moving faster through the pages.  Sometimes, I think writers of these kinds of books embellish the story with too much detail.  For example, the manner of dress of the Earl, etc.  The reader should have been able to determine the wealth and manner in which the English aristocracy lived, dressed, and ate.  We did not need to have that necessarily elaborated upon on page 800.  All in all, the book is a good story and I look forward to reading the second volume of the trilogy.
B008LY5VHE|5.0|Awesome stuff love it all jaws is a classic the wine wrack is awsome also hope you like it also.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|This DVD is magical, as is George Harrison.  The interviews and live takes really offer a glimpse into the talents of a very remarkable man.
0307720748|5.0|Such a great read for any entrepreneur or anyone seeking a career direction. It displays the courage and ferocity necessary to get it done and tells about the failures and successes of following your dreams.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I enjoyed this book but was disappointed by the ending. However it was a page turner with good character development.  I just felt the ending fell a little short.
B00A135YUW|5.0|I got the album as soon it was announced on twitter. Been<br />listing to the whole album non-stop since I got it. Solid album.<br />I didn't like the 'Blue Velvet' single that much but the<br />whole CD feels more like 'Ride' than 'Blue Velvet'. Has an harder<br />feel to it than 'Born to Die' that I really enjoyed.<br /><br />I would recommend the CD to anybody that liked 'Born to Die'. Or<br />anybody that is into music. She has a great voice. But now the wait<br />for the next album begins again. Very hunting voice.
1449410243|1.0|Too bad books are not rated on content. I was looking for \\"G\\" rated. The author found it necessary to \\"spice\\" up the book with explicatives like \\"f****ng, damn, God****,\\" etc. Only got past a few pages.
0061992860|5.0|I really couldn't have asked for better.  Everything one needs to survive from basics of what to eat and not eat in the woods, how to make snares and fishing hooks, housing, fires you name it.  Really a nice little find.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|\\"Once upon a time...\\" there was Christina Ricci.  You might remember her as the girl in [[ASIN:B0000542C7 Mermaids]].  In [[ASIN:B0011N1WE8 Penelope]], she's a young woman with a slight complexion problem.  She has a pig's nose.<br /><br />And so begins this story of how to love your inner beauty.  This storyline is pretty good.  And it's a modern fairy tale in a way that the Heroine saves herself.  She doesn't need the \\"knight in shinning armor.\\"  And in my opinion, that's a breath of fresh air.  Because I am tired of the damsel in distress predictable love story.<br /><br />The acting is well played.  Catherine O'Hara played the mother obsessed with physical looks and wealth (thus keeping Penelope locked inside the house her whole life).  O'hara was just the right crazed obsessive person.  And Richard E. Grant playing the wealthy father.  He does a well job here.  Both actors are funny and well casted.  Reese Witherspoon has a small cameo, but very likeable.<br /><br />James McAvoy shines in this romantic comedy.  His character is both believable and very much lovable.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this movie.
B000023VR6|1.0|I brought this cd from Amazon and was eager to listen to this cd again. I quickly learned that this CD was a dud, it not work AT ALL. my cd player kept rejecting the cd saying error!! I will be returning this CD.... :(
B00723NWJE|2.0|Saw Norah on Jools Holland and liked the two songs she performed but I find the album rather boring with no real change in tempo from song to song.<br /><br />It would have been nice to hear a side of her singing other than the same style for each track

B009JNXK88|5.0|The game is straight forward with simple 8 bit style graphics and nes style controls. The levels are challenging and get progressively harder.
B009KHBDUU|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  The storyline is a bit weak.  It could have been much better, but overall an entertaining movie.  I'm a big fan of Tim Burton and Jonny Depp and if you are too, then you'll at the very least appreciate this movie and enjoy it for what it is.  If you're not a fan of either Tim Burton or Johnny Depp, then you may not like it.  The weak storyline or perhaps scripting probably only deserve 2.5 to 3 stars (It has some really good one-liners and some really funny parts, but falls flat inbetween), but the costuming, acting and overall look and feel of movie rates at least 4 in my book!  And did I mention that Johnny Depp is in it.  You just can't go wrong there.  He's one of my favorite actors.  I have enjoyed pretty much everything he's done whether they were blockbusters or not, of course some are better than others, but I could watch him in anything!
B000VECAC6|5.0|How can this not disappoint?  Always look on the bright side of life - Eric Idle = perpetually hilarious. Enjoy!
B001U3Y5XE|2.0|The title intuitively makes sense, with the cache of the Lego name. But the actual game play is no fun at all. Quite simply, kids and adults alike can't build in 1 minute what it takes you to draw in Pictionary. So the rest of the game players (particularly kids) get distracted after a minute and the builder who's trying to get people to guess has to build for 5 minutes before s/he has anything that looks like anything. It's simply a mismatch in creation speed with the Pictionary concept....a disappointment given the Lego inflated price.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham does it again. When you think you have it figured out he throws in a twist. Great read as would be expected. Intriguing characters and captivating plot. Loved it!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I love Grisham and have read every book he's written. I was a little disappointed with this one. It was too confusing and only made sense at the very end. I was bored through alot of the chapters. I still look forward to every one of his releases and will keep reading.

1451638450|4.0|Captain Ivan Vorpatril is exactly where he wants to be - safely ensconced in the Barrayaran military as aide-de-camp to an admiral on the outlying world of Komarr, well away from his mother and the non-stop politics of Vorbarr Sultana, and completely happy that Emperor Gregor Vorbarra and Empress Laisa are having children - each one of them putting him further down the line of imperial succession.<br /><br />And then Byerly Vorrutyer shows up.<br /><br />From there, it all goes downhill for poor Ivan, who is the befuddled star of  \\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\", the latest novel in the Vorkosigan Saga.  Ivan is, of course, no match for his more famous cousin, Miles Vorkosigan, when it comes to dealing with strategy and intrigue, which makes Lois McMaster Bujold's choice to feature him in this novel perfect.<br /><br />Ivan is drafted by Byerly to protect two incredibly attractive women, both of whom belong to the fallen House Cordonah based on Jackson's Whole and are running for their lives.  When Ivan does the only thing he can think to do, in the face of Komarran authorities trying to recover his charges - he marries Tej and hires Rish as her right hand - it sets the stage for a return to Barrayar, a failed attempt to get divorced, a meeting with the new in-laws, and a potentially deadly gambit involving lost treasures from a previous Cetagandan occupation.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Cryoburn\\", the novel published just prior to \\"Captain Vorpatril's Alliance\\", Ivan gets the benefit from interplay with characters familiar to those who know the Vorkosigan series, including his mother Lady Alys, former Imperial Security chief Simon Illyan, current ImpSec chief Guy Allegre, and Emperor Gregor himself.  The Vorkosigans are all off-world for this particular story, though they get a lot of airtime in terms of references.  And in a nod back to \\"Cetaganda\\", an earlier novel in the series, we find out exactly why the haut-women of that empire are ensconced in force bubbles.<br /><br/>This is not a frenetic story.  It moves along at a more leisurely pace, mainly because Ivan moves along at a more leisurely pace.  To compare this story to the other stories that center around Miles is a bit disingenuous, but it is a natural comparison to make.  But it definitely has its good points, notably that Ivan has, like Miles, found his soulmate.<br /><br />Bujold redeems herself for \\"Cyroburn\\" with this novel.  This was a fun read that was long overdue, in terms of giving Ivan a chance to stand out.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|The case fits my new Kindle Fire very well.  It's easy to use, easy to remove the Kindle when needed, and safely stores the Kindle Fire when not in use.  Just wish the Stylus fit alongside the Kindle Fire when in the case -- that would be helpful.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Good but not his best, both of the main charactors are well formed and makes for interesting reading. Having read the later books in the series book helps flesh out the charactors.
B005C6HGSG|5.0|This was a fun light read for Supernatural fans! Bobby Singer was one of the shows most beloved characters and so this book will be a fan favorite!
B000I0QM04|2.0|As a lover of good science fiction, my advice would be to pass this one by...........unless you're under the age of 12.  First, the good.  The special effects are fantastic and the acting is top notch, as would be expected from the top drawer cast.<br /><br />The plot is disjointed and non-sensical.  At times it gave me the sense that they were making it up as they went along.  In order to compensate for the lack of a plot or any meaningful dialogue among the actors, the movie is absolute non-stop, balls out action.<br /><br />The movie is as frenetic as it is vapid - at least it is for adults.<br /><br />All that said, I probably would have loved this when I was about 8 or 9 years old.  At its heart, it's a children's movie.
0425263908|5.0|I thought it was a great read. Loved the story and the characters. I couldn't put it down. The story kept flowing. It's the first book of the trilogy and cant wait to read the others
B006OOHYIC|5.0|different levels and challenging changes. I like a game that builds o. the levels and stacks up rules. not as good at cut the rope, but in the ballpark.
030758836X|3.0|I don't know what all the hype is surrouding this book.  In my opinion, it wasn't nearly as good as the lady at the bookstore and ALL of my friends said it was going to be.  After hearing all of the hype, I thought this book was going to be GREAT; a real page turner.  I was so disappointed by this book.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Just as good as their first album. Worth the wait. I listen to it over and over again. thumbs up
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The entire book is written as if you are reading letters from the narrator to some male character. It took a bit of getting used to but overall works in the favor of connection with the narrator.
0385344333|5.0|as with all Reacher novels keeps you intrigued throughout the entire book....<br />Waiting for the next episode with great anticipation.
1451695195|5.0|I saw Dr Alexander on Fox News and the fact that he was a Neurosurgeon caught my interest and I immediately ordered his book. Reading this book was a true joy. I will make sure my copy is well read by many others. I have not had a NDE personally. About 18 years ago I witnessed my grandmother who suffered from Lou Gerigs disease 2 days before her death sit up in bed waving her arms tell my mother and I she saw Jesus and he told her she would be healed. She had not been able to lift her arms for months, it was physically impossible. After that she fell asleep in her hospital bed until she quietly slipped away 2 days later. When I tell that story to someone the reaction is apprehension. I know I was blessed to witness this. Sometimes seeing is believing. I thank you for sharing your story with the world Dr Alexander, it is an incredible one.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Slow, poorly constructed and littered with authorial laziness. It almost seems as if this book was forced.  Definitely the weakest of the three.
B006LSZECO|1.0|There was not one likeable character in this book. It left me feeling angry and empty.  The only reason I finished it was because we read it for bookclub.  I would not waste my time on this book.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|Great CD, Paul never disappoints. It's been a while but is the first time I have heard him solo with a 12 string.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Really like this album, I love how this band is keeping it real. It's sad how many of these bands from the 90's have sold out, very happy to see these guys still tearing it up.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pro:  Great sound quality, easy to program the buttons (Used the drivers from logitech website), long battery life<br /><br />Con: A little big for my head, even on the smallest settings, and because of that can get a little uncomfortable during extended wear like I regularly do.  The usb receiver is also in the bigger side which is rather annoying for a laptop.<br /><br />All in all:  Great headset, would suggest to others and would buy again.  :)
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great acting, great writing, and a suspenseful ride.  Claire Danes is just amazing.  I highly recommend, definitely well-worth the investment
B003N5ZIEM|2.0|I like this book, but the description said it would be a HARD COVER book and it is most definitely not. It has a spiral binding and the pages, cover, and back are not that sturdy.
B0033DQGW2|4.0|Not Dan Brown's best work, but still very good.  I really like all of his books and this one didn't disappoint, but it doesn't hold a candle to Angels and Demons or Davinci Code.  Enjoy!

B0000E6XH3|5.0|this movie is interestingly good! its like a music video for Daft Punk's whole Discovery album. but it is good! it has a plot, with conflicts and good character development for not really having any dialog. it is an anime, but there isn't any problem with that since its good. and it is Daft Punk, but there isn't any problem with that since they are incredible! it is a new type of film to me so i was interested when i watched it and because i enjoyed it so much i continue to watch it. if you are iffy on buying it, check out a song or two of it on youtube and if you liked it than definitely get it! you wont regret it!
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Why Nations Fail presents a logical, compelling case for the evolution of nations.  The argument is positioned as a clear contrast to other interpretations such as that of Jared Diamond.  A very successful analysis of failure.

B0081KTI0E|5.0|Tired of the blood and gore horror films that have plagued the cinema for the past three decades?  This film marks the triumphant return of Hammer Horror Studios with this 2012 thriller starring Harry Potter's Daniel Radcliffe.  Adhering to the old adage of \\"less is more,\\" this movie proves that what you DON'T see can scare you much more than what's in plain sight.  The Woman in Black is also truly amazing for the fact that all special effects are on-camera!
B006RED4GA|1.0|Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the \\"Horror\\" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again.
B003HGKJH8|4.0|Let me state upfront that I am a late-comer to the Tame Impala party. This band is a three-some out of Australia. I'm not even sure anymore how I recently found out about these guys, but I got my hands on this, their 2010 debut album, and boy, what a delight this is.<br /><br />\\"Innerspeak\\" (11 tracks; 53 min.) starts off with \\"It's Not Meant To Be\\", sounding garage-psychedelic-heavy guitars. \\"Desire Be Desire Go\\" follows, which is almost hard rock. Track 3 is \\"Alter Ego\\", one of my favorite tracks of the album, with a massive underlying drumbeat and just hard driving. As I was listening to this, it somehow reminded me of Film School's fabulous 2006 self-titled come-back album, dense, intruiging and exallerating. \\"Lucidity\\" is a 60s-reminding psychedelic blow-out. Great tracks follow one another. Track 7 \\"Jeremy's Storm\\" is an outstanding instrumental, showcasing the band's musical proweness at its best. Towards the end of the album, there is a surprise with Track 9 \\"Bold Arrow of Time\\", a blues-heavy tune reminding immediately of Cream and while it is different from most of the album's sound, it just rocks, and hard at that, just beautiful.<br /><br />In all, what an amazing album. How could I have missed this when this came out in 2010? But better late than never, I suppose. Just listening to this album, I can only imagine how epic it all must sound in concert. I can only hope to see these guys live at some point. I am moving on to their new album \\"Lonerism\\", which came out last month. Meanwhile, \\"Innerspeak\\" is an incredible discovery for me and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*UPDATE* (March, 2013) I saw these guys in concert earlier this month in Ohio, and what a blazing set they brought, playing a lot of \\"Lonerism\\", but also a number of tracks of \\"Innerspeak\\", and live it all sounded grander than on the studio albums. If you have a chance to see these guys live, DO NOT MISS IT.

B004X80QNG|5.0|I got my new Kindle Fire yesterday and needed a calendar.  I don't use Google calendars or any others and so I was frustrated that every calendar app seemed to want to sync to another account which I didn't have.  I just wanted to be able to enter events and tasks.<br /><br />This app does that perfectly.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|On the edge of my seat. Had to race to the finish! Demille never disappoints. Can't wait for his next book.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My 7 year old Star Wars fan cannot get enough of this game.  He already loved Angry Birds but now he's over the moon for Star Wars Angry Birds.  He loves how he earns new character birds and how the birds themed after those characters do different things than the old, regular Angry Birds.  We love the sound effects and music too.  Ingenious! Runs a little slow on my Android 2 but it's an old phone so it's to be expected.

B0057RCFQS|5.0|I was waiting for this classic dino adventure to come into a collectors edition that can be bought together. For anyone attracted by adventurous journeys with a dose of horror moderated by the acting of brave and courageous young and older actors, this adventure series is going to be a fantastic pick. I had a student who was fascinated by this adventure to the degree that he was motivated to launch a future career in the graphic and cinematic arts after seeing it.
B00642ZOIG|5.0|If you loved his last few books Micro will not disappoint.<br />For me, what I love the most about Michael Crichton's work is the fantastic detail he describes. This was an author who included pages and pages of reference material in his bibliography. A great read, fully immersive.
0812982622|3.0|While reading `The Orphan Master's Son' I frequently pondered that existential question `Is it always a good thing to be alive?'  That is also a question influenced by Buddhist philosophy which stresses the rare blessing of a `precious human rebirth' in the quest for enlightenment.<br />In North Korea a strange mixture of totalitarianism and whimsy allows `the dear leader' to harness the worst aspects of the human psyche into a State dominated by fear and loss.  Adam Johnson's novel explores what it might be like to live in such a setting.  It's a setting where it's hard to see the worth of being alive, or of being human.<br />The main character, a Korean version of John Doe, and several people from different walks of life associated with him, tell their stories.  Everyone suffers.  Almost everyone is forced to abandon loved ones or betray them in horrific ways.  Most characters experience extreme violence and torture.  The author gratuitously piled on gruesome descriptions of pain and suffering way beyond was necessary to make his point.  Yes, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.  Johnson made that case, but then he seemed to slip into the mind of a sociopath enjoying the tortures he dreamed up.<br />I applaud Adam Johnson for setting a novel in North Korea, a place few of us know anything about.  Exploring the effects on human consciousness of extreme poverty, police state tactics, and the cult of the ridiculous individual was commendable. If only there had been less of a parable and more of a real story, this could have been an important book.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I do not know what the heck is going on with your apps, but this one like so many recently will not open or will not load when they open, or fail in the middle somewhere. A large percentage of the apps I have gotten from you over the last couple of years have stopped working when they previously worked very well.  I do not know what you are doing that has caused this change, but it is increasingly infuriating. Customer service has NOT been helpful to resolve these issues.  YES, I have the latest version of the Amazon store software and YES I have deleted apps and reinstalled them to try and fix the issue to no avail. Support your customers or you will lose them!!  Fix these issues PLEASE !!
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Despite the mixed reviews this production initially received in London's West End, this polished stage version produced in Australia is astounding. I was fortunate enough to see it in a movie theater for a one night showing here in the states, my wife and I and only one other couple were in attendance- and I was blown away. If you even casually like Phantom, you must, you MUST see this tragically missed sequel by one of the greatest composers of our time. The score, the set, the voices, the characters . . . in many ways are actually better than Phantom of The Opera.
B003B96AOW|5.0|Deadpool has always been a favorite of mine. Got this to stand on my desk at work. Love it, and it looks good. May be kind of lame for a \\"play with me toy\\" (only has 16 points of movement) but for standing on my desk looking cool it's great.
B00280LYIC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, even though I am likely older than the intended audience. All ages will enjoy this book's mix of Greek mythology and story telling!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Product is just as described and worked as expected.  Allowed me to be more portable and flexible with my Kindle Fire
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|When I purchased this book I could barely believe it! I had the last book to the Heroes of Olympus. But I was wrong...there's a fourth, but that makes it better.  Anyways... this book is amazing and I recommend it to anyone looking for a good read. It had all the great action the other books did but with all the heroes combined. The idea of combining all the heroes was great so hats off to you Mr. Riordan. I loved this book and just cannot wait untill House of Hades.
0143119788|5.0|Saw a movie review on TV and thought this would be a cool book to read though haven't read it yet.  Recommended for mystery book reader.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Great movie for Halloween or Christmas. Amazing film score music and unforgettable characters! The first time I saw this movie was in the theaters for the release  and ever since, I've shared it with friends and family as one of my favorite holiday films.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|I have been a fan of the David Byrne pretty much my whole life and this album doesn't disappoint. St. Vincent and Byrne work great together and i<br />hope this is not their only collaboration. From the first notes to the last a thoroughly great album.

B008TTPQXA|5.0|This book will motivate you to start your spiritual journey, and if you are already on one, it will take you to a deeper level. Everyone should read this book!

0345803507|4.0|This is the 3rd & final book for Fifty Shades. The story made me laugh and cry, but by the time you read the 3rd book you already have an insight about Anna & Christian, but I think this final book, you understand a little more about Christian and his overbearing, controlling ways. His relationship with Anna was a first for him and her. He lost his innocence at a young age and had never known love between a man and woman, until he met Anna, who was an innocent and she was like know one he'd ever known.<br /><br />Christian is a wealthy controlling man, he didn't want to seem weak in anyone's eyes, when deep down, he was still the little broken abused 4 year old with a crack whore mother, who was a terrible mother to him. He just wants to protect, love and cherish Anna with money, love and sex. She was a virgin when they met and in his eyes, she was always and innocent to him. He was not an abuser of women, he did not do anything to Anna without her permission. Anna was never a true submissive and he really didn't treat her like one, the BSDM he shared with her was very mild and he was willing to give it up just for her. Some reviews felt he degraded women, but these women wanted to be controlled. This is one of the milder BDSM books I've ever read before and that's because that's not what the story is really about. Yes I've read better writing, I think these books could be edited and improved at some points, but the overall story line and plot was good.<br /><br />This book is about a lot more than just BSDM, so for those of you who only read the first book, I suggest you read the others and give it a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed, you have to read all of the books to really appreciate the story. I agree the writing could have been better and probably was longer than need be, but the overall story was good.<br /><br />Unless you're looking for a story based more on sex and not much of a story, than this book is not for you. This story maybe too deep for some people,this is a love story and yes there is a good bit of sex scenes, but not as graphic as you might think.<br /><br />The sexual descriptions or the BSDM in these books are mild compared to a lot of other books from other authors like Lora Leigh or Maya Banks, just to name a couple.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wanted to finish this book, merely to figure out what the deal is with C. Grey, but I just couldn't.  This book is just awful, I'm surprised it made it to the NYT best seller list.  It's poorly written and incredibly degrading to women.
0345803485|3.0|I give the 1st book only 3 stars because of how it ended.<br /><br />When I first heard about the Fifty Shades of Grey books, I put off reading them, until recently. I read the first book and understood a little of the disappointment on some of the reviews, because it left you hanging, but I disagree with some of the bad reviews. The first book isn't as good as the the 2nd and 3rd, but it's more of an introduction and building of the the characters. It could have been shorter, possibly combined into two books, instead of three. The combined stories amount to a love story that's heartbreaking, touching and erotic at times, the sex isn't all BDSM. It made me laugh and cry.<br /><br />You have to read all of the books to really appreciate the story. The sexual descriptions in these books are mild compared to a lot of other authors, like Lora Leigh or Maya Banks, just to name a few.<br /><br />This book is about a lot more than just BSDM, so for those of you who only read the first book, I suggest you read the others and give it a chance. I don't think you'll be disappointed.
B008458O3S|5.0|Starts of very slow, you don't think there's a lot to it but don't be fooled, there's a lot of packed bunch in this one.<br /><br />Really a lot of fun, especially if, like me, you have a thing for train games.<br /><br />Plus, the interface is really polished..<br /><br />Yeah, well done! :)<br /><br />EDIT: Doesn't start out that way, but the game eventually depends on your ability to differentiate color.<br />So for obvious reason, folks with color impairment may want to skip this one :(
0345803493|4.0|This is the 2nd book for Fifty Shades. It could have been shorter, possibly combined into two books with the first, instead of three. The combined stories amount to a love story that's heartbreaking, touching and erotic at times, the sex isn't all BDSM. The story made me laugh and cry.<br /><br />Christian seemed overbearing and overprotective at times, but understandable, due to his fear of losing Anna or anyone ever harming her and because of the way his childhood started out and the fact she was an innocent and not use to the harsh things in life. He was not an abuser of women, he did not do anything to Anna without her permission. Some reviews said how he degraded women, but these women wanted to be controlled. This is one of the milder BDSM books I've ever read before and that's because that's not what the story is really about.

B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Thank you, Christina, for making me feel such a strong sense of empowerment, self-appreciation, peristence and the essential need to love ourselves and part ways with everything that ruins us, makes us cry, causes us pain, undermines our existence.<br /><br />This album is truly about the feeling of the \\"unbreakable flower\\".<br /><br />\\"Lotus\\" is a record that sets your soul free and makes you want to believe in yourself.<br /><br />Makes you want to fight and survive.<br /><br />It's deep, it's strong, it's fun, it's dark, it's uplifting, it's Xtina!

B007SGLZP8|2.0|In his career, John Grisham has written some excellent books and a few stinkers.  The Racketeer, unfortunately, falls into the latter category.  While some of his \\"non-legal\\" attempts have sometimes fallen short, this is the first of his legal novels to do so.  If you suffer from insomnia and are looking for something to help you sleep, this is the book for you.  Otherwise, save your money.
1781163243|5.0|In honor of the recent release of the Halo 4 game, I thought it only appropriate to review this amazing book today.  I have been a HUGE fan of the Halo series, ever since the first game came out years ago.  The action, the weapons, the combat...it is an amazing series that is beyond captivating.  But it's not just the actual game itself that pleases; the Halo universe is one of the most vivid and interesting locales in which to place a storyline.  Such can be seen in the detail placed into the graphics for each game.  Halo 4 breaks new ground by giving much more detail in these graphics as well as a rich plot to go along with it.  Thanks to Titan Books, fans like me can now revel in the concept art that helped bring Halo 4 to life.<br /><br />If you are any kind of fan of Halo, then this book is a must-buy for you.  AWAKENING: THE ART OF HALO 4 takes you deep into the mindset of the designers at 343 Industries, and shows how their ideas evolved into the excellent game that was released just last week.<br /><br />With stunning imagery and exquisite detail, the concept art in this book will leave you almost as breathless as the game itself.  The pictures are lavish and rich, portraying the new world and realm in which the Master Chief finds himself this time.  And I have to say, these images are the very definition of beautiful.<br /><br />The imaginations involved with creating such complex yet lavish scenes must be staggeringly powerful.  The fine folks at 343 Industries have raised the bar and set a new level of excellence with this work.  AWAKENING: THE ART OF HALO 4 chronicles part of the work involved, by giving in-depth but short commentaries on each scene and the mentality behind it.<br /><br />Comparing the concept art to the scenes in the game (which I have done quite a bit) is a lot of fun.  It's very interesting to see how different the final graphics can turn out, even after being fleshed out with a brush.  But nonetheless, the core elements in almost every scene are there and spring vividly to life.<br /><br />But aside from the visuals, AWAKENING: THE ART OF HALO 4 gives us a sneak-peek at new characters, creatures, and items that can be found in the game.  The book also fleshes out existing characters and creatures by providing new, finer details to their images.  This provides double the excitement, as it feels like visiting old friends who have changed due to time.<br /><br />AWAKENING: THE ART OF HALO 4 is an amazing book and it definitely belongs in your collection.  Even if you are not a Halo fan, you should check this volume out, as it has some of the most amazing landscape artwork you'll ever see.  The images within its pages are inspiring and mesmerizing; and they might just convince you to play the game as well.  Give this one a look.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I haven't finished yet. I have no idea what is going on in the story; there is no connection between the opening and the present scenario. It's a chore to continue - no enjoyable at all.<br /><br />I may dump it and move on.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Best movie of year, great actors and the plot was fantastic. I am still quoting the movie lines. Loved it.
B0012CJQY6|5.0|Excellent!! ordered the whole series before we finished the first season. Once you start you wont be able to stop.
B008HK3S4K|5.0|Kindle fits perfectly.  Velcro closure.  I can also put my stylus inside the sleeve with my Kindle so I won't misplace it.  Very happy with this product.
B008966SIU|5.0|Shields is amazing.  I can't stop listening to it!  I wasn't sure Grizzly Bear could make music that I would love more than Veckatimest, but they have.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I've never bothered to review an app before, but I've been trying to find a way to take notes and highlight pdf files for so long, I had to.  This app lets you highlight, underline, sticky note, draw shapes and free lines. You can have it automatically save all of your marks.  It all seems pretty flawless so far. I've read a few journal articles so far and have zero complaints.  Very much worth the price.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|so additive play lasts long time! told many friends to play.  very worthwhile<br />played this game for hours and keep commingled
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the Walking Dead! This is a great DVD set and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to catch up with everything happening in season 3.

B009VB97EY|1.0|Horrible acting. I wouldn't bother seeing it. Not worth even a penny. Sorry. I was hoping to like it. :-(
B000PC0S5K|5.0|Tolle explains incredibly important spiritual matters and all sorts of terminology in beautiful writing that is easy to understand. I resonated deeply with this work and feel empowered, inspired, and hopeful.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Entertaining, great cinematography, decent script (well worded), computer animation was well done, however I still wanted more. Interraction of characters wasn't always believable. Needed more action and evoluation of alien was too quick.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Boring.  B o r I n g b o r I n g b o r I n g s
B000Q79HTC|5.0|As you may or may not know this movie is one is a series.  The acting is outstanding.  The plot and the twist and turns make it extremely exciting to watch.  A must have movie not just this one, but the whole series.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fast-paced, quirky look at the post-apocalyptic world, circa 2045. The majority of humanity lives in a virtual world called the Oasis where they can look the way they want to look and be whatever they want to be. The main character is an 18-year-old boy whose real-life existence is pretty grim, but whose virtual existence is pretty good. Early on in the book, we learn that five years earlier, the creator of The Oasis, a Steve Jobs-like character, died. He left a video will wherein he states that his vast estate, worth $240 billion, will go to the person who finds an easter egg he has hidden somewhere in The Oasis. The whole world is initially consumed with finding the egg, but when a year goes by without finding it, all but a dedicated few give up the search. Those who continue searching are nicknamed \\"gunters\\". Our protagonist is a gunter. The story is about his search for the egg, his relationships with fellow gunters, and the varying challenges they must conquer in their quest for the egg. I highly recommend this book, even for those who are not typically sci-fi readers.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This movie had the action and the twists and turns you expect from any good movie.  However, it has a greater underlying moral purpose:  the trials of those living in war torn areas who suffer unheard in refugee camps, the struggles of Americans who battle a lifestyle of violence and drugs v. a life given to Jesus and how that faith is tested when faced with greater suffering, and that ONE PERSON CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A WORLD IN NEED!  I would recommend this movie not just for its uplifting faith but for the reality of the struggles of faith when faced with overwhelming suffering and the determination to act to help.  The main characters are not perfect people; you see the struggles they have with faith throughout the movie.  And there are still people in refugee camps around the world that need our help!
B0097AQEOK|5.0|For those interested in sound quality, these discs sound great and are much improved over the sound of the initial 1980's CD releases.  All discs in this box are 44.1k, 16b.  Song to a Seagull, Clouds, Ladies of the Canyon, Blue, and Don Juan's Reckless Daughter are encoded in HDCD.  I have been unable to determine if these are the same upgraded HDCD remasters released as individual CD's several years ago, or if WB UK/Rhino have again tweaked the sound with further remastering.  For the Roses, Court and Spark, Hissing of Summer Lawns, Hejira, and Mingus are not denoted as HDCD but rather simply as CDDA.  Again, I have no way to determine if any new remastering has occurred or why the latter discs would not have been encoded in HDCD.  But again, the sound quality is much improved over the initial releases.  I would have preferred that all of these discs be re-released in SACD or BluRay Audio, but no such luck.  Given the limitations of 44.1k and 16b, I am impressed (and relieved) that the sound quality is so much better.<br /><br />For those interested in the quality of the packaging, I am again impressed.  Each disc is housed in a quality paper package that exactly replicates the original vinyl album artwork.  For those of you who never owned the original covers, here's your chance to experience them now.  I am surprisingly able to read the complete lyrics where included (although a good magnifying glass might help).  The graphics are sharp and the color is accurate and often beautiful (remember that many of these covers were mainly adorned by Joni's own art).  The box itself is no stunner but sturdy and functional.  No new liner notes or artwork are included.<br /><br />The music contained herein speaks for itself, but suffice it say (as others already have) that this is some of the greatest music of the 20th century by one of the most gifted, unique, and important songwriters and performers of the 20th century.  And the price for each disc was a little over five dollars, at least when I purchased it.  Thumbs up from me.ollars, at least when I purchased it.  Thumbs up from me.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|fun game that uses your brain. Good for kids and adults. Different from those mindless games which I liketoo but this is a nice change.
B0027MJU00|5.0|My gosh.  Since my first taste of this author's work, I have been drinking them in, one after another, like a lost woman finding a soda machine in the middle of the desert!  To say that she is an incredible author just doesn't say enough.  My house is a mess, my husband may be checking out other women as replacements, my dog hasn't been out in weeks!  If I had a failing farm, I would be a Day.  I highly recommend this book but also warn of graphic violence, adult situations, quite impolite language.......and a nightmare or two.  Yum!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|All five books of the gripping Silo Series are right here.  I can't gush enough on the story (stories?), characters, and the entire world that Howey has created.  This is one of those books that as soon as it ended, I was quite sad, because I didn't get to read more.<br />Watch out for some crazy plot twists, some great characters, and, most importantly, the story itself.  You will look at the world around you differently when you're finished.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was wonderful. Nicholas sparks never disappoints. It is the type of book that hits all of the emotions.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|DH & I went and seen this last night, it is way better than the first. Some people are upset that it follows the plot of the game (#3) loosely, and if you are expecting an original horror story, you'd better go elsewhere. But if you want to return to Silent Hill, and see all the horror in HD instead of PS2 graininess, this is the movie for you. The nurses and mannequins are especially well done. I was a bit disappointed that it is only 95 minutes long, they could have easily added another 30 minutes of plot from the game.<br /><br />**************SPOILERS*************<br /><br />Did anyone else find it weird that she was sitting on her dad's lap? Maybe it's just me, but I outgrew that when I was about 9. In the movie she is supposed to be about 16/17 I think, it really creeped me out. (in the game she is in her 20's?)<br /><br />I loved how she put that bully in her place at school. lolz<br /><br />They could have done away with her \\"defeating\\" Alessa at the carousel, and just had her merge back with herself. Would have made more sense that having a metaphysical showdown with herself. Especially since there is no info conveyed besides a couple of lines and facial expressions. These kinds of scenes work in books, not so much in movies.<br /><br />I'm guessing from the ending there will be another Silent Hill sometime, but I don't know if they plan on using the plot from the second game (which wouldn't make any sense at all) or if they are going to write an original third film. I haven't played any of the newer Silent Hill games, so I don't know if they have anything to do with Heather or Harry.
1433502429|5.0|I knew I liked the ESV translation, and the study bible didn't disappoint with the added commentary. The one I got said it was used but it may as well have been new for the condition, I'm a very satisfied customer.
159102594X|5.0|Love this series. Not for the squeamish. These are very dark books, and there aren't any \\"good guys\\"; just some people that are bad in some ways, better in others.<br /><br />If you like this book, you'll love the others. If you don't, they only get more depressing as the series goes on.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it is so fun and you can talk with friends. it is a good game for free. but gold can be very temting to use. and then you have to pay money for more. but ather than that it is a good game.
B008US25FW|5.0|If I had to compare \\"Sans Attendre\\" to an English Celine album, it would be reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000VI5CF4 Taking Chances]]. The album is an array of different styles. Like Taking Changes, Sans Attendre is experimental; you get power ballads, pop standards, rock-inspired samples, and a cover (Ne Me Quitte Pas).<br /><br />This album is Celine's most daring yet as her voice is pushed to the limit and is forced into new ranges and styles. This is my favorite French album, which I thought was impossible seeing as I was obsessed with [[ASIN:B000ZG64KO On Ne Change Pas - Best Of]].<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this album. It doesn't matter if you don't quite understand what she's saying. You will be taken on a joy ride.

B004FHP9KA|4.0|Many sages and saints from various religious traditions have said that what appears to be real and concrete to us is really more like a dream; and that the most real world is on a higher plane of being. This film explores these ideas in a provocative way.  We have all seen what we thought were solid realities, begin to dissolve into nothing, beginning with the Lehman bankruptcy filing on Sept 15, 2008, and the free fall of the stock market for the next six months.  Remember, that when the collapse began, no one knew when it would end, or even if it would end.  There was no way to know that our economy would not regress to its condition in the Dark Ages, or even the Stone Age.  And we still don't know that, really.
B009GEEMLY|3.0|The movie has a lot of effort and you can see that, you may get bored a little bit, because the story is kind of repeated and also predictable and some parts really does not make any sense in the overall story.<br />But overall, you may want to see it but if it was for less than $0.99.
0312641893|3.0|This book definitely did not live up to the hype.  It's a cool and fresh idea, but it's all really underdeveloped.

B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Both my 9 year old daughter and I read this book.  My 9 year old does not enjoy reading but she loved this book so much that she could not put it down. I also loved this story.  Wonderfully written and a real page turner.
B007SGM084|5.0|I always heard everyone talking about “Fifty Shades Of Grey“ & really didn't think much of it until I saw my mom bought the book so I kindly borrowed it well since last week this trilogy has been my life.. MIND BLOWING I couldn't put it down. These books make me mad tho ha ha making you fall in love with the book & characters & make you wish life was really like this but actually once your done reading you come back to reality & get all depressed & like OMG. But seriously THEE BEST BOOKS I've  READ!!! Totally worth the money & time to read.. I can't wait for the movies  to come out:)
B004AP09CU|4.0|This was the Boss when he wasn't being political and his music touched all of us in a special way.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|\\"The Raid: Redemption\\" is a great example of pure action movie. You don't have to talk about it to tell someone what this amazing film is all about. You just have to show it and they will understand. It is an action movie with real martial artists, directed by someone who knows action choreography. Despite some lulls and an unnecessary plot twist, \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" is one of the best action films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Rama (Iko Uwais) is a rookie officer and member of a SWAT team organized to apprehend a crime lord Tama Riyada (Ray Sahetapy), who owns and lives in a 30-storey building in Jakarta. However, the surprise attack by the special armed police ends up with gun fights and martial arts combats between the officers and the thugs, and a bloodbath and body counts that outdo the famous Aobaya fight sequence in \\"Kill Bill.\\"<br /><br />The film's rather simple story is mostly set in the apartment block where Rama and other officers are trapped. Directed by Welsh-born Gareth Evans with confidence, action-packed \\"The Raid: Redemption\\" wastes no time getting down to business with minimum back story about Rama the protagonist. We know he is a good guy who is married and going to be a father, and of course he is an expert fighter (later on, the film tells us more about his background, though).<br /><br />That's all we have to know. The action stunts are hyperkinetic and violent, and aptly so. The Indonesian action film knows what it is doing. With tons of intense, bone-crunching martial arts stunts, it delivers what it sets out to do, and that's what matters to us.
B004G8Y0D0|4.0|Good Clean Nostalgic action Fun. Remiscent of the old tv show, but slicker play, bigger action & effects and just plain better.

B00009V7P8|5.0|I discovered Damien Rice nine years ago. I woke up early in the morning to feed my daughter and sat in the rocking recliner. She was only a month old. I'd turn on VH1 morning wake up because it had nice, soft, soothing music. The first time \\"Volcano\\" came on, and every time, this song played her ears would perk up. You could see her listening to it and paying a great deal of attention. Before the song was over she was asleep. I ran right out and bought the album. To this day she still falls asleep to it. I do not play it every night, but a lot of nights I do. I start it from the beginning, \\"Volcano\\" is the second song. Before the song is over she is fast asleep. Not only is it soothing because it puts her to sleep so easily, but it is one of my fondest memories. Feeding her in the early a.m. the joy she got every time it came on, and her sweet face falling fast asleep to his beautiful enchanting song.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked this book until the end...it was a little disappointing.  The writing style is unique but the storylone is a little disturbing...

B009NQKPUW|5.0|Movie was well cast, directed, etc.  There were a couple of scenes (like the opening scene) that although carried a strong message, seemed to have no other place within the story-line. Overall, I thought the movie was pretty darn good. Quite entertaining.

0345803507|1.0|I tend to think that anyone who is going to read this garbage has already done so. This review is probably a little late in coming.  If, however, you are one of the few that hasn't read this book-please know, you are smarter than the rest of America. I'm one of those people who have to read a book to the end once I've started.  In this case, I had to read all 3 because I bought them as a set.  This is the very first book series that had me rethinking this need.  Christian abuses Anna through the entire book-he is controlling, jealous, and physical-and the worst part is-throughout the book-he is written to be \\"the ideal man\\"-you can tell that the author desperately wants you to like him.  I only hope that this book remains a book that women read and that men don't start reading it and suspecting that women want them to act like this.  I read it thinking that if you had a friend experiencing this relationship-you would be screaming at them to get out!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved Loved Loved I want more and can't wait! This series was amazing, recommended to others to read and experience. Was hard to put the book down.This book was far better then Fifty Shades of Gray
B002W1GCX4|5.0|This is a great buy, had all these songs on vinyl (except London Bye Ta-Ta & Ching-A-Ling) back in the day.  Been following Bowie ever since.  Had Ching-A-Ling on David's VHS tape LoveYouTillTuesday.  This is a great package, love the stereo versions.  This is very early stuff.....'67/'68.....pre SpaceOddity, pre MickRonson & TheSpidersFromMars.  No electric guitars.....orchestral.  Very nice!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am an avid book reader and have read all of John Grisham's books.  The thing about him that I love is the fact that I start to giggle from the begginning to the end.  He writes some of the silliest and funniest things, people playing cat and mouse games, keeping you hooked up and unable to put the book down.  I know not everyone liked it, but I did.  John Grisham is a master craftsman when it comes to books and no one can make the FBI look desperate in a book as him.  Can't wait for the next book....
B0087HT36U|5.0|Really enjoyed this game and looking forward to next part. Some times it takes awhile to figure out where to place your rocks and such. But still fun. Hurry with next level.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|HEAVEN IS REAL by Eben Alexander, MD, has content that is definitely worthwhile reading. Its impact derives equally from who Dr. Alexander is in his professional life (a neurosurgeon and former professor at Harvard) and the description of his near death experience (NDE). For reasons the author thoroughly explains, his NDE has grounds for a claim of uniqueness. This book is recommended to those who want to hear Dr. Alexander's scientific explanation for why consciousness does NOT depend on a functioning neocortex, as well as to those who would appreciate the insights he gleaned about the central position of love in relation to what God is as well as to the interrelatedness of all mankind and the universe.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This solitaire program  works great! I'm using it on a Kindle FIre HD and love it. I would recommend it.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|This lady needs no awards or accolades, the clear winners are the ones who will play this album and get lost in the imagery Lana Del Rey weaves. The Paradise Edition is the E-ticket for those who didn't want Born To Die to end. It is clear Lana is an avid reader; her love of literature has rubbed off on her and has blessed her craft. If you're not a fan yet, you will be. It only takes one poem to draw you in and you will never want to leave. Make yourself at home with Gods and Monsters, Blue Velvet, Bel Air, American, and Ride. Born To Die is perfect, Paradise is perfect, without question anything Lana Del Rey is a must have. You only live once, you are only young once - don't deny yourself the Lana Del Rey experience.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|This made my top 10 list of worst movies ever created, and I would give it zero stars if Amazon allowed it. It got great reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, and I have no earthly idea why. The plot was slow and pointless.<br /><br />We fast-forwarded to the ending just out of sheer morbid curiosity. What a train wreck. If I had purchased the physical DVD I would use it for target practice. There goes 90 minutes of my life I can never get back.
B007D3WGXQ|5.0|I am blown away by the imagery created for this tarot.  I am SO GRATEFUL to the artist for blessing us with her amazing talent.  She has created a dream world that you never want to leave.  I literally was gasping while looking through this deck.  The sense of wonder and imagination here is just breathtaking.  It had so many elements that I loved.  I loved the use of animals both real and magickal.  Dragons, birds, foxes, even a monkey!  It may seem a bit odd but it all worked so well together and OH THE TREES!  I loved the trees.  For a magickal person such as myself nature brings me my greatest joys and pleasures.  So much of that feeling is captured in this tarot.  They are CHARGED with a love of nature and magick  As I looked through this deck I was overwhelmed with feelings af gratitude for just having seen the images.  So I must express a very heartfelt THANK YOU to the author and artist for gifting us with this tarot.  If you are at all interested in getting this tarot, DO you will never regeret it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Had to download this as soon as the mp3 was released at midnight.  I've got the cd on order and will be able to compare the sound on the 2 soon. For now, I'm just overwhelmed with the power and versatility in these songs. She does \\"Bring him Home\\", effortlessly and powerfully--no straining on the high notes like many male singers. \\"Winner Takes It All\\" is heartbreaking. She can take another artist's version of a song like \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\", sing the exact same notes, but the timbre of her voice gives it a completely different sound. (BTW, her produces says she did \\"Rainbow\\" in one take. No wonder she finished the album 2 weeks ahead of schedule.) There's a good blend on all the duets, although I prefer the ones with Donny.  I know \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" is associated with football/soccer in the UK, but she recreates the original inspirational impact of the song.  I wish she'd sing it in New York and dedicate it to the victims of the hurricane.<br /><br />Even if you're not fond of show tunes, I think you will be impressed with her voice itself.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I know this is configurable and I do have it working with iTunes for song changes but for every day tactile volume control this thing rocks. Also it works with Windows  8 Pro with no issues.
B001EYU1VO|2.0|This joystick has many adjustments but missing an important one. The stick tension is not adjustable and requires too much force and looses sensitivity for precise flying control. Also product support is poor. I have had two requests submitted without any response.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|If you're a John Grisham fan, and I can't imagine anyone who's not, then you won't be disapointed with The Racketeer.  Grisham has a way of writing that is compelling to read, and in The Racketeer he weaves an original, intricate plot involving the judicial and penal system in our country that turns it on its head.  Excellent work.
044042335X|1.0|This is only the second book that I have read by this author.  I loved his book called, The Enemy, a Jack Reacher novel.  This book was quite different. I couldn't relate to the characters, the story was not very fast moving and the whole book was pretty boring.

B009A9EQL6|5.0|It is natural that when a new album is released by a band, fans of that band will be \\"disappointed\\" at first. We are accustomed to the sound of the songs we have known from them in the past and we - subconsciously - hold them to a known standard, which really isn't fair to them at all, but it's human nature to want our \\"warm and cozy\\" without change.<br /><br />Does this album sound like Rocks? Yes and no. Should it sound exactly like Rocks? No! Rocks was published in 1976; why would something released in 2012 sound like something released in the mid-70's? Times change, sounds evolve and bands have to evolve as well or they will be forgotten.<br /><br />Put aside your preconceived notions and listen to the amazing songs on this album more than once. Go ahead, try it. Don't give it a quick listen. Listen to it!<br /><br />This is a fantastic album! It rocks on so many levels and with Jack Douglas back in the house, that old \\"groove\\" comes shining through!<br /><br />Aerosmith fans waited more than a decade for this album and it is an amazing piece of work by the band we all love so much.<br /><br />Their best ever? Probably not. Better than anything else out there? Damn straight!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have always enjoyed Patricia Cornwell's characters, especially Kay Scarpetta.  The relationships, the conflicts, the reality and the flaws of the people in her stories are so very, very REAL!!  Her latest work:  The Bone Bed, did not disappoint!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|What a wonderful and passionate story, Gideon is a wonderful and comes man who knows what he wants and gets what he wants. Eva was just as hurt but fought for what she wanted and found the truth in the end. Moral is we all have a past and need to make our future/fate. Amazing<br />_
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved this book. It has given me an escape n I could not put it down. Very well written n I feel like it covered everything. I just wish it never ended I still want to know how there life is but I guess that's how you know its a good book. Can't wait to read more.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing, hooked from page one. Ferocious passions and story line make you read from start to finish. Cross is hot and sexy, she is beautiful and sexy in her way. Then they connect fireworks of hormones and emotion. Wow is just one of many words for this talented writer.
B009A9EQL6|4.0|Great song's but where are the guitar solo's? Even with there old producer from the Toys in the attic day's Aerosmith sounds like they did in the 90's not the 70's. Most of the songs are good songs but there is not one memorable guitar solo on the whole album. I thought that going with the old producer was to go back to blazing rock song's full of killer guitar work Like on ROCKS.But for most of the album Joe seems to be playing in clean tone. There are some great rhythm riff's & hook's. Your usual 90's catchy chorus's and your 90's epic love song's. The album does have plenty of power punch it's just lacking the real guitar solo's. If it would of had the great guitar solo's Like on Pump this album would of been a 5 star album.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Anyone who has heard Pentatonix before knows their a cappella sound is amazing, all created with just 5 voices.  This album does not disappoint, and again raises the bar, this time for Christmas music.<br /><br />You'll be blessed by Kirstie and Mitch's captivatingly clear voices, especially in O Holy Night and Carol of the Bells.  Scott's incredible range will blow you away (you'll hear him sing pretty low in O Come, O Come Emmanuel).  Kevin's steady beatboxing rhythms throughout the album, and the horn section (The Christmas Song) prove his dedication to his craft. And last but never the least, Avi's bass is as always, unbelievable, and his solos, especially in O Come, O Come Emmanuel are hauntingly beautiful.<br /><br />I could go on and on about each song, but I strongly encourage you to purchase the album and hear for yourself. These are not the same old arrangements you hear every year at this time, but put together with that special PTX flavor.<br /><br />In short, Pentatonix has put together an album that will appeal to everyone, in every age range. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I adore Ellen and it disappoints me not to give this book 5 stars but I thought it was just mediocre. Yes I chuckled periodically but felt like a lot of chapters were just fillers to take up pages. The material in this book was funny enough in parts for an opening monologue but not enough to warrant publication. Sorry Ellen!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Liked it But thought it was kind of slow, action parts were good & it gave lots of food for thought after watching, could watch again to sort out some uncertainties and questions as to its prequill content.
0399157565|2.0|Let me say first that I've read and loved every one of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books. Even when she left Richmond and so much changed, it took some adjustment but I still loved the character. So I really hate to write a negative review, but this book was a huge disappointment. I was almost 400 pages in before I finally began reading it because I wanted too instead of because I was bored. The opening scene was painfully slow and the whole book was filled with unnecessary detail. I'm sure some writers tend towards a more verbose style than others. But as a fairly recent college graduate who wrote more than a few papers that came up just short of the minimum word/page requirement, the detail in this book felt too much like filler material. I don't remember her previous books being like this either, but maybe with a more interesting plot the detail overload is less noticeable or bothersome.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, a situation involving one of Scarpetta's employees was awkwardly written and seemed completely immaterial to the rest of the story. The identity of the killer was a surprise, but I also feel like the ending left far too many loose strings. And not in a way that suggests a future book will pick up where there this one left off, at least not where the mystery portion of this plot is concerned. I really think its time to retire this series. And if she does write another Scarpetta book. I'll definitely be reading a few chapters before I decide whether I'll buy it, instead of buying it as soon as it comes out without even reading the description as I previously have.
B000TERDHA|5.0|LCD Soundsystem are wonderful and this album lives up to expectations from their other works. They definitely transcend any simple label though, like 'dance' or 'electronica'... much more varied and complex, in a good way! Very sad to see them disband last year.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|We bought this for our one year old. We wanted to buy him a gift that he wouldn't grow out of for years to come. I chose this because I love retro, 50's style, rockets. It is a simple toy but can spark imagination. He loves to hold it right now, but as he grows up it will become new to him each and every step. Cheap toy but not cheap looking or feeling. I highly recommend this toy
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The movie had an interesting premise, which my husband and I (as lovers of sci-fi/fantasy) enjoyed.  The movie overall is nothing to write home about, but if you are desperate for something to watch you won't hate it.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Another gripping Rebus novel. Slow to start and then it just drags you in.<br /><br />This can't be the end if Rebus...
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Not a great movie, but it did the trick (i.e., we were glad that we rented it).  He is such a great actor that he makes it hard not to like him in whatever role he chooses.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I love all of his books, but this may be top on the list! I am re-reading this again and it is just as good, the second time around!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|A very good movie - very well acted.  We watched it well after its release and subsequent acclaim, so we had the benefit of knowing it had been very well received.  We are typically more your comedy/action/adventure types, but we were very glad we rented this.
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Well, I saw Sucker Punch.  I'm not sure how that happened, but here I am.  And I do feel like I've been punched.  I know I'm not the first to make that joke, but, seriously, what else could that title be referring to?  It makes no sense in the context of the movie, other than to say 'look out, audience, this is gonna hurt!'.<br /><br />Sucker punch is a perfect little microcosm of successes and failures and some more failures that encompasses everything that is good, bad, and awful about Zack Snyder as a film maker.  Unfortunately, though perhaps not surprisingly, it's much more bad than good.<br /><br />I think the worst of the problems are hinted at in the very opening; we have a slow motion, dialogue-less montage where we learn about our leading lady (Baby Doll is her name, more on that later) and her troubles with her... father?  Step-father maybe?  And the accidental death of her sister, resulting in Baby Doll's incarceration in some kind of very specific mental hospital for gorgeous and thin twenty-something girls who act like teenagers.  It was an interesting choice; the visuals are clear (if a bit juvenile) and it tells the story well enough.  The problems are that a scene like that never happens again, making it stylistically superfluous, and the following scene gives all the exact same information only spelled out for the audience in ridiculous detail.  Making the opening completely superfluous to telling the story as well.  That first scene of dialogue, after the opening montage, also goes out of it's way to rape logic, as evil step/dad and rapey orderly work out their nefarious plot to ice-pick Baby Doll's brain... right in front of her... while she stands literally in between them and an authority figure who could stop the whole movie if Baby Doll would open her damn mouth and take some initiative.  But she doesn't, she doesn't...<br /><br />I'm off on a little bit of a tangent, but I think it sums up the movie - overdone visuals, poor story-telling anda healthy dose of chauvinism masked as grrrrl power.<br /><br />The gimmick here, of course, is that we spend a bulk of the movie in Baby Doll's fantasy world.  ...or ALL of the movie, it's not really clear.  The main setting shifts from the asylum to some sort of fantasy, parallel bordello, with the same actors playing parallels of themselves.  There's no warning for this shift or explanation, it just sort of happens and deal with it.  And then, from there, Baby Doll slips into yet ANOTHER fantasy world whenever she dances for men; partly because she's escaping the horrors of something, but partly because it's painfully obvious that Emily Browning can't dance.<br /><br />I'm fine with this as a concept - the problem here is that the jumps are so artlessly handled that we have no idea how the fantasy world translates to the real world.  When they're peeling potatoes in the bordello, are they peeling potatoes in the hospital?  When someone gets killed in the double fantasy world, do they die in the hospital?  How?  Did they ever exist?  Yes, children can and do build thick layers of fantasy for themselves to escape trauma and abuse; so thick they can confuse it with the real world (the girls in this situation are a bit old for that, but whatever) but we, the audience, need to know what the stakes are and what the rules are at least in a general sense.  The oddball, action oriented \\"missions\\" the girls take in the double fantasy world are so loosely connected to their plan to get out of the hospital/bordello/whatever that they start to feel like seven or eight music videos strung together instead of a movie.<br /><br />I'm sure this concept could be done well... oh, wait!  It was!  In [[ASIN:B003Y1D7UC Pan's Labyrinth]], a movie of stunning beauty that expertly weaves a young girls fantasy's with her horrible realities and shows us clearly how one influences the other.<br /><br />Huh.  Maybe Zack Snyder should have watched that one first.<br /><br />I'm being negative, but it's not all bad.  There are some great performances by everyone except Emily Browning, especially the core group of girls except Emily Browning.  Most notably, Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone who are clearly working very hard for this retarded script.  Some of the actions scenes are very, very well done - I'm remembering the choreography in a battle in WWI style trenches, which is an excellent blend of gun play and close-quarters combat.  Pretty exciting stuff.  Also, and I mean this in the most sexless way possible, the girls all look incredibly impressive holding their guns.  Large rifles are heavy and awkward and the girls clearly went through a good deal of weapons training to look like pros and it really come across.  Very impressed, I was.<br /><br />Again, all that would be wonderful if they were trying to make one or two music videos.  It's not enough to hold up a movie.<br /><br />The awful icing on top, though, is just how grimy and sexist the movie feels.  I know it takes place in a world where these girls are abused (in a vague, non-specific, but probably sexual sort of way) but I'm talking in a meta sense, in an 'outside looking in' sense.  It's clearly a movie that was made so grown men could watch young girls in short skirts; the creepy part is that it pretends to NOT be that.  It's a movie where girls murder hordes of faceless monsters, but only in their fantasies to escape the real world where they're raped and used (if I understand what little subtext there is).  We're never actually shown them trying to solve a problem and, in the end, they utterly fail as Baby Doll is lobotomized and all but one of them end up dead (I think).  Spoiler's ahoy.  Hell, the character's don't even get NAMES, they get PET NAMES, like 'Baby Doll' and 'Blondie' and 'Sweat Pea'; you know, the type of things you'd call something you possess but don't think too highly of.  Again, I'm not saying these ideas couldn't work, but it comes across as an older man's masturbation fantasy that he's tried to dress up in a way that can be sold to young girls.  If that isn't creepy, I don't know what it.<br /><br />I'm being overly harsh, and in no way am I accusing anyone of anything overly rude or illegal.  But the movie is just such an artless mess of images and ideas that it's easy (and kinda fun) to nit-pick it to death.  I wouldn't call it lazy and I hesitate to call it stupid.  But it's certainly a craftless, jumbled... yeah, okay, stupid mess of a movie.  It's not a complete failure, but it really rides the line.<br /><br />And you know what the kicker is?  I can't think of anything else to suggest watching in its place.  The Kill Bill movies, maybe?  Seriously, I go nothing over here...<br /><br />...Still feels like I've been punched, though.  So mission accomplished.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|I am not going to improve upon the reviews of her biggest fans.  I heard her on the radio (who didn't) and liked her unique sound (compared to so much out there right now that sounds the same).  I liked what I heard so ordered the CD.  Simple as that and I am definitely do not regret the purchase.
B0032JTV6U|3.0|Everything looked food but when I opened the case it was all broken and all the DVDs were not in the holders.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend BEFORE the movie came out.  While I liked the book, it is painful to read.  One of those where you are glad you did it once you are through it, but getting to the end is pure work.  If you like very esoteric reads or artsy movies you will probably love this, but just prepare yourself because it really is unlike any other book you've ever read.
B0094ZJ7HO|4.0|Elbow is by and large one of my favorite bands. Even though they're one of my favorites, I'm still always skeptical when it comes to an album of b-sides and leftovers.  However, Elbow did a great job of hand-selecting this collection of songs, and it doesn't disappoint.  There are a few stand-outs, like Whisper Grass and Lay Down Your Cross, while others are sedate enough to fall asleep to. Though most of the tracks here are the softer fare in the Elbow catalog, it's still very much Elbow, and will tide their fans over until the next proper album.
B004R0WKNE|3.0|This is not a great movie, which it should be given the actors in it.  Instead it is a cute romantic comedy.  We enjoyed it, but I don't know that I would recommend paying to rent it - wait until you find it on TV one day.

0316228532|4.0|It took me a while to really like this book; The characters are revealed early on to be mostly unlikeable, and the blunt, often vulgar language can be off-putting at best. At times I found myself being pulled away from my emotional investment in the story to wonder why the author had to include such dark behavior, such language, as she did. Like, where are the redeeming qualities of these people...whom can we  root for...was this novel merely a vehicle to distance JKR from her Harry Potter persona, do average teenagers really say, think and do these things, etc?<br />But I stuck with the book, and am happy that I did. Ultimately this is a novel about the ramifications of our actions, about loss and redemption (albeit weak and perhaps short-lived), about tolerance and forgiveness, and about understanding those with whom we have no commonality.<br />3 weeks after finishing the book, I am still haunted by Cubby Walls, Krystal and Terry Wheeden, and Sukhvinder Jawanda; although the other characters remain in memory as well. Turns out that once I saw the author's belief that these characters have been damaged by past experiences, becoming people they might never have aspired to become, I was able to embrace the book.<br />One  hopes that those damaged would receive the opportunities and tools and desire for positive change, and some in the storyline tried valiantly; thus, my remembrances of Cubby, Krystal, Terry and Sukhvinder.<br />Looking forward to keeping this book on the shelf for a while and revisiting it without any preconceived notions or expectations.

0316228532|1.0|J.K. Rowling is not the first author to make the jump from youth fiction to adult fiction.  Others have done so with varying degrees of success.  However, I don't believe I've ever known of an author who tried so desperately to distance themselves from their former work that they were virtually guaranteed to alienate 80% of even their adult fan base.  Harry Potter attracted plenty of adult fans; I'm not sure who Rowling thought she was going to attract to this book.  I had heard before I started reading that there was going to be offensive language and sex; but the book sounded interesting, and I had so much respect for Rowling as a story teller that I decided that I was willing to put up with that if the story was good.  I'm no prude, and this is certainly not the first book I've read with \\"R\\" rated language in it.  However, it will go down as the single most offensive book I have ever attempted to read.  By page 26, I found that I was unwilling to wade through any more garbage.  The characters were not even remotely likable.  I felt like I was watching maggots crawl through rotting flesh - some might find it interesting, but I was revolted.  I'm afraid that with \\"The Casual Vacancy\\",  J.K. Rowling has lost much of the respect I had for her as an author.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|If I could I would give this book infinite stars. I am a teenager and this book was so wonderful I actually wished I could have gone back and lived during that time. Charlie was sweet and I like the idea of writing a book as a series of letters. It was sort of like a diary, but better. It highlighted his love for Sam and Patrick, his cluelessness when it came to Mary Elizabeth and Alice. Patrick and Brads story was touching and Sam's past was understandable. I would recommend this for young adults/teenagers. :)

Needless to say, as a drummer, SG is my fave band of all time.  Just got this album and will be listening for a while.  I can only imagine that it will stack up to all their other albums.  Audio quality and production are on par with Down Upside.  Need to go see who produced and engineered it.

B0041KVW2K|5.0|Ok. I'm sure that this box set is going to be a highly conversed topic. My guess is that the previous reviewers have not listened to the records so their opinion is based on assumption. No it isn't sourced from the master tapes, but a similar source to the 2009 remastered CDs. From what I have read however this set isn't just a transfer from cd to lp. There was some tweaking to make this set unique from its cd counterpart. Either way what it comes down to, is \\"how does it sound\\"?  Well I'm listening to it right now, and I think it sounds pretty darn good. I have only gotten as far as \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and the early albums sound bright, clear and most of all scratch free. There are Beatles fans out there that might not own many Beatles records, which would make this set perfect for them. In my opinion to get an original Beatles set in near mint condition is not only expensive but very difficult.<br /><br />You also have to consider the system that you would be listening to them through. If your system consists of a Crosley vintage stereo from Target you might not want to spend the money on this set. I'm not saying that my setup is anything amazing, it's probably the minimum you would want to listen to \\"audiophile\\" quality records. I think that these records were mastered with more modern audiophile setups in mind. Mine varies from late 70's to mid 80's.<br /><br />Everyone's stereos and ears are different so when you read people praising/complaining about this set it's very subjective. Make sure reviews you read are from people who have actually listened to the set.<br /><br />If you're on the fence about buying this set consider what kind of system you have, and wether you will listen to them enough to make it worth it. I know I will.<br /><br />Also my set did receive some minor damage during shipping so when you are considering wether to have it shipped or not, you might want to transport it yourself.<br /><br />  @@@@@@@@@Update@@@@@@@@@<br /><br />I initiated a return through Amazon. They were very accommodating and another one is already on its way. I will update the review once I receive it.<br /><br />I received my replacement today.

B0071AKB38|4.0|I cannot stop myself from being amazed every time XMI releases another of their speakers. It simply blows me away.<br /><br />I love X-mini speakers. I own a: X-mini Max (Stereo), X mini Max 2, two X-mini II's and I have owned this one. So, it's safe to say I'm a huge fan.<br />Now, don't go expecting BOSE Sound Quality from these little guys, but WOW they DO pack a punch. Everything you hear about it true, these things have INCREDIBLE sound quality. (I am an audiophile so I do have a taste for quality speakers) I haven't encountered a single X-mini that hasn't met my expectations, until this one. Quickly I'll let you know it came in a beautiful clear acrylic case. (Very similar to the iPod cases) It came with a lovely traveling pouch and info on the great charity stuff X-mini does.<br /><br />I bought this because of its biggest selling point, BLUETOOTH. Let me say, it does that job fantastically. It's hassle free to setup and easy to stream your music to. I used mine with my iPhone 4 and it was beautiful.<br /><br />The only reason I dropped a star was because... well... the \\"boom\\" factor left after a few days. When I first opened and used my X-mini KAI, I was blown away by the sound quality and volume. I played it for hours. However, over the next few days, it lost that \\"oomph\\" that I have come to know with X-mini. At first I thought it was the battery, so I charged it full, and still, nothing. I just couldn't get it loud enough for my liking.<br /><br />I would have loved to keep the it, but for $80 for a speaker that I can't get volume out of, I couldn't justify it. Maybe mine was a defective unit, and who says that I won't end up buying it again someday; but for me, it's going back. Sorry KAI.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Forever a X-mini fan.

B00571F26Y|5.0|This is a great book to read if you are looking for reasons why you may need to eliminate gluten from your diet, and practical ways to achieve going gluten free.  I had been contemplating going wheat free for a few months.  A fried at work was loosing weight and I asked how she was doing it.  She said she read the wheat belly diet and had gone gluten free.  I was still skeptical as I was afraid I could not sustain a diet free of wheat for very long.  My friend assured me it was easy and to read the Wheat Belly book.  Being a cardiac nurse I was encouraged to see it was written by a cardiologist.  Although the information is stressed in ways that are repetitive at times, the advice is solid and the transition has been much easier than I anticipated.  The recipes are simple and the evidence to support changing my diet to be wheat and gluten free made sense to me after reading the information presented in this book.  In addition, I feel great.  Looking forward to the new cookbook coming out soon.

145162445X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Although I am generally familiar with the major topics in cosmology such as dark energy, dark matter, Inflation Period, and CMBR; this book ties them together in a neat package and describes the current thinking in a lucid way. Further, it attempts to explain how our universe could have emerged from nothing. According to the author, something can come out of nothing. In fact, he argues that something almost has to come out of nothing.<br /><br />The findings described in the book clearly indicate that there is no need for divine presence in order for the universe to exist. To quote Steven Weinberg, as the book does, \\"Science does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes it possible to not believe in God.\\" Thus, for an atheist, this book provides ammunition to argue with those who believe in Creationism or Intelligent Design.<br /><br />However, this book should not be thought of as a manifesto for an atheist. I do not believe that is the central intent. Rather, it is written to satisfy our curiosity about the world we live in, how it emerged, and how it will end.
034580404X|1.0|If I could give this book series negative stars I would.  I can't beleive an author could take this subject matter and making it BORING!  There was no substance to the characters at all.  The author could have made this one boring, poorly written book instead of three.  She needs to invest in a Thesaurus and look up other words for \\"murmur\\". I think that word was used around 1000 times.  Ana also constantly refers to her 'Inner Goddess\\" and says that Christian 'cupped her sex'.  Who says that??  Ana also calls Christian Mr. Grey throughout the third book.  Very redundant.  These books seem to be thrown together with very little thought.  I started reading them because of all the hype.  I barley made it through the third book.  I skipped over every other page of the same exact description of them having sex.  I'm not opposed to two consenting adults having this kind of relationship but Ana and Christian seemed way too boring to live that lifestyle.  Don't waste your time or money on these books.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|The beauty of this disc is it's consistency . As the song order progress, each new song grates on your ears and senses worse than the previous song. No point in reviewing any single song ( they are all terrible ). After so many great years, Mr. Dylan has run out of things to say !

B008WCP2PG|2.0|First let me say, I watched this movie for the obvious reason, to see Channing Tatum!  Aside from stripping, he's an amazing dancer, really impressive.  That being said... there was no supporting acting going on.  Channing and the lead woman had no chemistry, the acting was sub-par, at best.  The story line was really weak, and some of the stripping scenes were actually cringe-worthy.  Matthew McConohay is a greasy weasel, Tarzan is just plain gross, and the other men are such bad dancers who can't compete with Channing.  Don't waste your money on buying a copy of this.  Wait until it's in a dollar bin or a redbox.

1936608618|5.0|In his book, \\"Power Speed Endurance\\"' Brian Mackenzie has done an excellent job of bridging the gap between traditional endurance training and the CrossFit fitness model. He takes the time to acknowledge and explain the background of endurance training as well as the theory and research that led to the development of CrossFit Endurance.<br /><br />For the beginning endurance athlete, the book is an excellent source of information and a great time-saver. The newbie will up and running in shorter time and will have the information to tailor a program that will be most beneficial to them. For the experienced athlete, especially one who is frustrated with their progress, or plagued with injuries, this book will be of tremendous help with a paradigm shift to training differently and continued performance improvement.<br /><br />I have spent a lifetime in the fitness industry and \\"Power Speed and Endurance\\", by Brian Mackenzie is a must-read for anyone seriously interested in improving their fitness and athletic performance. I know for experience, both personally and with my clients, the advantages and disadvantages of traditional training techniques.

B009VB97EY|3.0|It was entertaining, but wouldn't say Academy Award contender.  It was worth the time and the money.  Anytime you can see a bunch of guys dancing to \\"it's Raining Men\\", is worth the time and effort.
1611761182|4.0|I listened to the first of Ken Follett's trilogy &#34;The Fall of Giants&#34;, which begins the story of a British, German, Russian, and American famillies at the beginning of the 20th century through World War I. &#34;The Winter of Our World&#34; is a continuation of the saga that takes the listener through the turmoil of Post War Germany, the rise of Nazism, the fall of the stock market, and into World War II. Both recorded books are clearly abridgements. In &#34;The Winter of Our World&#34; the abridgement seems more apparent. Nevertheless, I found myself attached to the characters once again. In the second of this trilogy new characters, offspring, are added to the story. I suspect they will be a significant part of the third novel, which will close out the 20th century. I think the books are better than the recordings but the recordings are good and well worth listening to. History buffs will enjoy this recording very much and will want to listen to &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; if they have not done so already. In fact, listen to or read &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; first no matter. I look forward to the third novel in this series.

B00003CXA6|5.0|The history of the Civil War as it entered Gettysburg, Pa. , fighting thru Gettysburg and the third day, the South was badly defeated just south of Gettysburg. Even though smashed, the South still fought on for two years before their surrender. A well done movie and very close to  truthful happenings.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Having spent time at the hotel in Estes Park, Co. that this story was based on, I can say that this movie is one of the best ever made from a King novel.<br />My favorite Kubrik film.<br />I always find excellent buys on DVD's on Amazon, both for my own use and for gifts.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This HBO television series is excellently done. Depicts the books to the letter. This series helped me get through Super Storm Sandy and no power for 12 days.
0812550706|5.0|I knew nothing about this book when I ordered it, so I had no idea what to expect. I had heard that it was an excellent example of science fiction. My book &#34;No Gertz&#34; is classified as science fiction.and I am considering writing a sequel. I thought I might learn something from &#34;Ender's Game&#34;. I expected an academic learning experience (only) but am enjoying this book greatly in addition to learning some excellent writing techniques.
B0073PPKNM|4.0|From the very first bars of the opener \\"Mira,\\" it's clear that Gardot has moved worlds apart from her Philadelphia beginnings.  The Absence reflects Gardot's travels through Spain and Portugal during the recording process, as many songs don a light Euro air.  Her characteristic whispered delivery is further cushioned with strings, plucked nylon-strung guitars, and layers of light percussion.  \\"Lisboa\\" recalls mid-60s Astrud Gilberto, right down to the quivery vibrato, as she samba'd her way past the Ipanema girl.  Gardot's melancholy murmurs may suggest a naughty Oughtie, but she also owes the Brazilian 60s, as The Absence has a presence in both eras.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The Outlander is rich storytelling that compels the reader to want more with each page.  Diana Gabaldon covers every genre of writing within The Outlander from adventure, mystery, romance, humor, history to science fiction and poetry.  Her character development is unparalleled and Jamie and Claire grow with each chapter.  I'm thankful that the book is just a prelude to the series which forever keeps me yearning for more.
B007L96SI6|4.0|Reinhart's 3rd-place finish in American Idol 2011 earned her a record contract with Interscope.  Unlike many other Amidol semi-finalists who flounder with identity once in the recording studio, Reinheart has a consistent sound and style - a cross of Amy, Dusty, and Britney (that's Winehouse, Springfield, and Spears, respectively).  A gutsy mix of soul, girl-pop, 60s innocence, and Oughts' oxygen, Listen Up! is a promising debut.  Reinheart can sing, yell, or growl, as the song demands.  In spite of the album's somewhat watery mix with inconsistent bass, Reinhart delivers a cheery riposte to the dark side of the Madonna / Gaga gaggle, as a poster girl for the sunny-side-of-the-street crew.  \\"Free\\" is the single, but \\"Hit the Ground Running\\" is her exclamation point.
B000002O1Q|5.0|the Streets of fire sound tract is very good.  It has  great sound.  I am very satisfied with this product.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|May may be behind the latest Auto-tuned rave by more than a few decades, but that's a g-g-good thing.  Virtually no one can challenge her status as rockabilly bar queen.  Her swaggering vocals flips between a stray cat yowl and a full torch mode -- as in \\"ignore me, dude, and you're gonna get torched.\\"  May's old-school band is a blast of stand-up bass, guttural guitar on full tremolo, ragtime muted trumpet, and slap-dash drums that define backbeat.  Her lyrics are often no-question nonsense, e.g., \\"I love your wits and your wobbly bits\\" (\\"Inside Out\\"), but don't try to figure it out.  Just hang on for the wooden rollercoaster ride.  Between the fizzy Setzer-like shakes, May tosses in tears-in-your-beer blues like \\"Too Sad to Cry,\\" with Dave Priseman's probing trumpet wahs answering her Patsy Cline laments.  Jeff Beck obviously valued May's retro originality, since he included her on his 2011 tour.  What other rockabilly artist would reach completely to the other side, tossing up a remake of Soft Cell's \\"Tainted Love\\" that beats the original, hands down?  True to its title, Mayhem closes with a punched-up remix of May's first hit, \\"Johnny got a Boom-Boom,\\" from her debut album.  Pure, adulterated fun!
B007THA4FI|2.0|The storyline was disapointing. Why do I want to read about a long list of dysfunctional families. None of the characters were any better off at the end than at the beginning. It was like watching a reality show on tv.
B007G3H8Y0|3.0|Fresh off the heels of Save Me, San Francisco and the mandolin-paced, chatterbox wordplay of its hit \\"Hey, Soul Sister,\\" Train's California 37 now offers two songs overloaded with lyrical non-sequiturs (\\"This'll Be My Year\\" and the title track); two songs with backbeat-driven rhythms (the puzzling, back-to-back pairing of the single \\"Drive By\\" with \\"Feels Good at First\\"), and no less than 55 pop-culture references laced throughout the lyrics.  OK, it's fun to play \\"find the flag\\" as the songs go by, but, just like Billy Joel's \\"We Didn't Start the Fire\\" quickly devolved from engaging to annoying, some of Train's songs may follow suit after several repeats.  The best tracks are the ones that play down the \\"clever-is-as-clever-does\\" stance and instead concentrate on a single theme (\\"Bruises\\") or a unified feel (the Ricky-Martin-on-steroids mariachi pump of \\"50 Ways to Say Goodbye\\").
B0091574VI|5.0|Educational and entertaining. This is a movie about real animals and their life. Funny parts and some sad moments. Good for all ages.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Reunited with the reclusive Brian Wilson, whose brilliant arrangements defined the band's seminal hits, the Beach Boys have soundtracked your summer getaway.  That's Why God Made the Radio is top-down, Rayban-wrapped, cruise juice -- all sunshine, warm breezes, and wave on wave of the band's trademark call-and-response, layered harmonies, as airy as the cotton candy after the ferris wheel.  The lyrics and rhymes won't win any literary awards, but then, who thinks on the beach?  The title track asks \\"Isn't it time we danced the night away?  How about doing it just like yesterday?\\", and the answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\"  Summer fun never goes out of style, and, after 50 years, the Beach Boys have proven it once again.  This time, their masterful touch is the closing track \\"Summer's Gone,\\" suggesting a quick glance over the shoulder before heading into a metaphorical autumn.
B00633PFQC|5.0|I started this book as a reading for our book club,and found it contained fascinating insights not available elsewhere into the grey areas between free market economic theory and morality.  Neither the extremes of economic theory or of moral theory are belabored, but they're present in casual language.  I've been informally researching the area of social markets the last year for my blog, and found Sandel covers key topics like the interactions between goods and markets like no one else.  Plus which, it's well written.  It reads as a kind of stroll through touchy topics like paying to upgrade a prison cell or selling body parts, so the detail is more than I might personally choose.  But the insights along the way are worth it.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Krall, a master of supper-club piano-and-vocal jazz with bossa-nova nuance, turns back the clock almost a century, to speakeasy days.  Glad Rag Doll dances through the `20s and `30s, exploring songs from Krall's dad's 78s (note to the iTunes crew:  old 10\\" vinyl discs that spun at 78 r.p.m., managing maybe 10 minutes of music per side).  This is a different world for Krall and her fans.  Guitarist Marc Ribot occasionally lets loose a ripping, distorted lead, while Krall counters with piano figures closer to Elton John than Nat King Cole.  A number of tracks don't even have piano, relying instead on acoustic or electric blues guitar riffs to push the vocal along.  Buyer beware - this is not the sophisti-cat Krall most have known and loved.  Rather, she's a wronged woman in an unmarked cellar bar with a password, 12-bar blues, and time to kill.
B0085RQLXK|1.0|I like virtually all of their albums until now. Nothing sounds like the old Jack Douglas days in which he produced so many classics. Instead we get the same old lame ballads (4 no less) designed for radio airplay. Only now the radio ignores rock music. The rockers don't rock. Especially bad is \\"Freedom Fighter\\" by Joe Perry. They need to hang it up.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|An audio and video document of the quintet's 2011 tour, The Mothership Returns is a return to form for Return to Forever.  Long-time alums Chick Corea, Stanley Clarke, and Lenny White join forces with guitarist Frank Gambale and violinist Jean-Luc Ponty on revisits of their prog-jazz past.  Some tracks trace to a note their original studio version's twisting, stop-on-a-dime arrangements -- this band is tight!  Others explore and stretch, as the musicians challenge and prod each other to new ground - this band fears nothing!  Around White's and Clarke's precision rhythm base, Corea paints piano and synth splashes, Ponty's violin soars in lyrical flights, and Gambale shreds guitar lines that make Carlos Santana sound like a Mel Bay student.  The sound is round, well-produced, and clean.  And there are no best parts, `cause they're all on.  Don't miss the Escher-like turns of \\"Medieval Overture,\\" the laid-back funk of \\"Sorceress,\\" and Corea's instrumental duel with the audience in \\"Spain.\\"  The mothership has returned and offers a trip like no other.
B009YX02T8|5.0|The wrap-up soundtrack to the 'Twilight' movies definitely has a different tone from the other soundtracks.  The songs on this one lean more towards the emotional end of the spectrum, as opposed to the tunes from Muse, Death Cab, Florence and the Machine, etc. that made up most of the first four soundtracks.  Don't expect exactly the same kind of feeling from Breaking Dawn, Part 2, just enjoy what's there.  The songs are excellent and Carter Burwell's contribution from the score is absolutely beautiful.  Very glad I purchased it.  I am eager to see how the songs fit into the movie.
B006ZGDC26|5.0|THIS is a box set!  Philly International was a powerhouse label in the 70s, virtually defining much of the Philadelphia sound.  This set of remastered tracks from the likes of M.F.S.B. (PIR's house band), The O'Jays, Archie Bell, Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, Lou Rawls, Jean Carn, The Trammps, McFadden and Whitehead, and many others is a history lesson, a dance party, and a thrilling tribute to producers Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff and arranger Thom Bell.  One would think that over 10 CDs, the PIR formula (a funk base topped with ice-cream strings, backup singers, lightly layered instrument fills, and a melodic vocal line that won't let go) would wear a little thin, but it doesn't.  That was the genius of Gamble and Huff.  By keeping enough key elements to retain their characteristic sound while altering just enough to give a unique twist to the next artist, they created a legacy that's rich with sample-heavy material perfect for today's pop, hip-hop, and rap recyclers.  Disc 7 is perhaps the most interesting, veering left into the jazzier side of PIR (Dexter Wansel, Michael Pedicin, Jr., and some outré M.F.S.B.).  Packaged with a detailed 60-page book on PIR's history, as well as track-by-track insights, this is Philadelphia tradition, deserving of a prominent place in any collection.
B002SW8Y2E|5.0|One of the best books I've read for a long time. Brilliantly researched and plotted, set in the paranoid atmosphere of Stalinist Russia.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Imaginaerum is Nightwish's transformer album.  Where the previous Dark Passion Play welded lightning-strike strings and Carmina-Burana choirs to its thudding metal crunch, Imaginaerum is even bigger, all ways `round.  The band's phantom-opera metal has morphed  into a full Wagnerian orchestra-with-choirs, capable of thunderous chants cresting an earthquake rumble of cannon-fire drums in lockstep with the detuned guitars' bottom-heavy bombast - and then a silencing of the roar to a single voice when needed.  Although more than 100 musicians contributed parts, singer Anette Olzon finds and holds her own classical space in this beautifully imagined, medieval mayhem of an album.  And what of the competition, i.e., the Nightwish-wish-to-bes?  Well, Epica's male vocalist reaches and retches, inducing listener recoil.  Xandria's drummer overpowers the band with his non-stop sixteenth-note bass drum kicks, like mating a machine gun with guitars.  Trans-Siberian Orchestra is all fuzzy chords and fuzzy-wuzzy fairy tales.  Nightwish instead embraces the theater inherent in its sound, going over the big top in what they include (even Celtic dance!) in their haunted castles.  Imaginaerum is electrifying and engaging.
B0094FQZTM|5.0|Hell, I can't really sugar coat this. Either you like a band like Tiamat or you don't. If you like this kind of music then it is a five star must. If you yearn for the old days of growling death metal look elsewhere. The \\"Scarred People\\" is like a cross between Sisters of Mercy, Type O Negative, and Pink Floyd (if you can imagine that), and this new albums blends those three areas of music very well.<br /><br />There is nothing on here overtly heavy, which is a great thing as the previous album \\"Amanethes\\" was brilliant except for those moments when the band tried too hard to recapture something of its heavy past. \\"Scarred People\\" takes the best elements of the last album and dedicates a full hour to those moods. Dark and somber for the most part, there are a few tracks that feel strangely uplifting, but this album really shines through on songs like \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", \\"Love Terrorists\\", and \\"Radiant Star.\\" All these songs are haunting, perfectly creating a mood only this band seems able to capture.<br /><br />Honestly, Tiamat has always been at their best when they dropped all the fuzz of early albums. Wildhoney was great, and I appreciate songs like \\"Whatever that Hurts\\" or \\"Visionaire\\", but albums like \\"A Deeper Kind of Slumber\\" and \\"Judas Christ\\" showed a lot of potential in the goth realm for this band. \\"Prey\\" and \\"Amanethes\\" showed the brilliance of Tiamat though, and \\"Scarred People\\" keeps on this path. There are so few gothic type bands that have the courage to create this kind of music without hiding under the growl of death metal. Tiamat's new album kind of gives the finger to those waiting for a return to 1992, and they have delivered another fine album in doing so.
B007MJ9LA2|4.0|Santana returns to his six strings and leaves behind his experiments with pop vocalists who generally served to relegate him to the status of a hired hand.  The man is re-staking his claim.  While Shape Shifter has more than its fair share of tender acoustic passages that snap, dart, and jump bar lines, the album's strength is in Santana's muscular electric lines.  His signature Paul Reed Smith spits, snarls, and roars.  Though 65, Santana has been known to practice in unbroken, five-hour sessions.  Such channeled concentration erupts in tracks like \\"Nomad,\\" a firework of energy, emotion, and clipped, blistering, sixty-fourth note phrases and full-chord slides.  This is what was foreseen in 1969's \\"Soul Sacrifice,\\" as a 22-year-old kid's A-minor maelstrom set Woodstock afire.  It's unfortunate that the liner notes make no mention of Santana's bandmates on this recording, including  Dennis Chambers (drums) and Chester Thompson (keys) laying down some spirited grooves that shape Santana's shift back to his future.

B006ZZANG0|4.0|Wainwright borrows a bit of Broadway in his writing and delivery.  Melody lines arch their backs, reach for the rafters, and aren't afraid to breech bar lines in their attempts to sound, well, conversational.  Witness the sprightly title track, using an off-rhythm \\"look at you, look at you, look at you\\" exclamation that grabs the listener and won't let go.  This distinctive style, wed with Wainwright's unerring pitch and controlled vibrato, brings a polished elegance to his songs.  Out of the Game isn't perfect, however.  There is the slight reediness of Wainwright's vocal tone, as if Phil Ochs or David Ackles had reappeared in this small circle of friends.  And one clunker should have been dropped from the album; \\"Montauk,\\" with its single-chord, arpeggiated phrasing, is a nag, tedious and annoying.  But those are quibbles.  Wainwright's intelligent pop, this time with a country touch, puts Out of the Game very much in it.
B000YKG5L4|5.0|I already had and very much enjoyed Waking Up, but this one is really good too.  They are climbing the ranks as one of my favorite bands to listen to, especially when trying to pass time at work and/or while doing homework for school.

B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought the movie Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was hysterical from beginning to end not necessary to think too hard with this one it was pure entertainment and incorporated many of the important characters from that time period.  It was funny to see Stephen Douglass escort Mary Todd to a dance.The period dress by the actors appeared accurate to my knowledge and that fact that the vampires were the Confederates was most appropriate due to the historicity of the piece.  The hyperbole is the reason my review is four star.  I don't believe it was the intention of the author, director or producers to make this a historic piece.

B0085G0DH6|2.0|If you have not purchased other CD's from the Jarrett's &#34;Belonging&#34; group, you will probably really enjoy this live performance, as it is vibrant and exciting.  But if you have all or most of the others, including &#34;Nude Ants&#34;, then this is more of the same.  I am a big Keith Jarrett fan and have most everything that he has recorded and I enjoy Jan Garbarek but I expected to hear something very different in these recordings and not a very similar performance to what is already on CD.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|And it's pretty much as good as Game of Thrones. Martin has done something very interesting with these books I think: defying those of us who normally can't bear invented kingdoms, dragons, compound nouns with capital letters and all the rest of the tedious fantasy paraphernalia, he's crafted a compelling story about power and those who wield and want it. It's the reverse of Tolkien, who concentrated on the external features of the worlds he describes, their languages, customs, history, etc. By comparison Martin sketches all that in, uses it as background and writes in perceptive detail about human needs, desires and conflicts. There are echoes of mediaeval European history, which only serves to make the stories more authentic in human terms. Oh, and there are some great woman characters too.
B0091Q82L8|4.0|As an avid fan of The Who, this is a fascinating recording. At last I can compare what I consider the greatest live rock album of all time (\\"Live At Leeds\\") to what happened the following night. On 14 February 1970 they played Leeds University, which all Who fans know and love as the \\"Live At Leeds\\" album. On the 15th they played at Hull City Hall, which is documented here. Parts of this show were fixed by way of cheating. The first 6 tracks were missing John Entwistle's bass track, so they used the same bass tracks from \\"Leeds\\". This cheating is fine by me. If I didn't know I wouldn't be able to tell without a close listen. The only time it comes close to not working is during \\"Young Man Blues\\". You can hear an echo of Roger's vocals from Leeds for about a minute, and it is different than the Hull version. But in order to restore this to a listenable historic document, I say to Pete & Roger \\"You are forgiven\\". The setlist is virtually the same as the Leeds show; the only difference being that they didn't play \\"Magic Bus\\" at Hull. I was one of the Who fans that just couldn't see spending over a hundred dollars for the 4 CD \\"Leeds\\" deluxe set, especially when the Hull show was the only part that I didn't already have. I say bless everyone involved who made the Hull show on CD possible, and available as a stand alone product. At this point, having only played this CD set since its' arrival today, I am very pleased, and can only see this getting more rotation in my home CD player. I really feel this is a 4 1/2 star CD, but that's not an option. If you love The Who, you can trust me and buy this one. I saw it in the stores for 29.99 plus tax. Amazon, as usual, gives you a better deal. I call that a bargain!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all three books. Didn't want it to end. Not exactly what I was expecting, which made it even better.  Couldn't put it down.  Finished all three in less than a week.
B0006GAO3G|4.0|I've heard so many friends rave about GET SHORTY that I finally thought it was time to see what the fuss was about. I never knew the plot but assumed someone was trying to &#34;get&#34; Shorty for some reason. GET SHORTY has a finely detailed plot with a dream cast that includes John Travolta, Rene Russo, Gene Hackman and Dennis Farina to name a few. Travolta does a fine job in playing the quirky mob flunky Chili Palmer. Palmer can be rough and tough and violent but he's pretty much a good guy trying to straighten out the messes others have created. His latest adventure takes him to Hollywood and into the sights of B-movie producer (or maybe that is C-movie producer)Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman in a great role). It's all fun and games as Palmer tries to out think and out maneuver all the &#34;bad&#34; guys while trying to feed Hackman a story that sounds very much like Palmer's own life. It is funny and it is witty but don't be mistaken. There is a lot of traditional Emore Leonard violence in the film. The violence seems too out of place in a &#34;comedy&#34; even a black comedy. The humor would be more in humor in these thugs avoiding murder and serious injury. Rene Russo is at her loveliest--one of my favorite actresses whose talent seems to have gone under appreciated these years. Danny DeVito is great as the egotistic actor that Zimm and Palmer are trying to reel in for their movie. Much like the ending of  PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE, we have a &#34;movie&#34; within a movie based on what just happened in the movie we are watching with several hilarious cameos playing the characters we have seen in the film. A fun film that could have done without the serious violence.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|The story is well written and action packed with a love story and characters that teens - even today - can probably relate to on some level. Boys or girls, this book contains something for every reader. The boys face real challenges, the sister faces a life she doesn't control, war is coming and everyone has to fight whether they want to fight or not and they're supposed to hate and distrust who they're told to hate and distrust.<br /><br />At the end of the novel, the world is on the verge of war and up in the air. There are times when a novel won't feel like a complete story with a hanging ending but this one does. That's not to say that the reader doesn't have the need to know what happens next, I know this one does - but the ability to come away from a series read knowing you've just read a really good story is a priceless one.

B009AZZEU2|5.0|I love the first reviewers satire. That was a good laugh. :)<br /><br />What can I say? Soundgarden is back after 16 years with a great and heavy album. For those of us that grew up on rock, grunge and alternative in the 90s, we were younger and more impressionable. But we definitely understood the sound of a generation. I was 24 when Down on The Upside was released, and I'm 40 now. Although my musical tastes have evolved, I still come back to Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, Green River, Mudhoney, Mother Love Bone, Temple of The Dog (the album created by the unfortunate event of Andrew Wood's death), and the Melvins.<br /><br />With that said, I've given this album a listen several times over the course of the last week on iTunes. Without going through a song by song breakdown, I can definitely say it's worth the money. If you're a fan of the band, this is really a no-brainer. While it doesn't have the sound of Badmotorfinger or Louder Than Love, it does remind me a lot like Superunknown. Part of that is the sound, and the other is the catchiness of the songs. I didn't feel this way with Down On The Upside. While good in it's own right, I do prefer King Animal. Some songs will stand out for different reasons. For example, Attrition to me sounds a bit like Sonic Youth and Mudhoney, which is why I personally love it. And some of the sludgier tunes are reminiscent of the Melvins. That isn't to say that they holistically \\"sound\\" like any of these bands, but more that they're reminiscent of other bands within the same time capsule.<br /><br />If nothing else, listening to this album will remind you of a time when we all had fewer responsibilities. It a was time when the things that WE cared about were center stage in pop culture rather than Jersey Shore and Lady Gaga.<br /><br />For those of you that are new to Soundgarden or simply want a great rock album, give Soundgarden a shot. I say rock because grunge is really an overused term in my opinion. And honestly, if you really knew grunge, you wouldn't classify Soundgarden as such. But in 2012, you really won't find anything else out there like King Animal.
0307743659|5.0|I enjoyed the book alot. I am a big fan of Stephen King. I plan on reading more of his books
B00003CX8N|4.0|I ordered this DVD, because a friend of mine had purchased a used copy from somewhere and the last 5 minutes were missing.  We wanted to watch the entire movie and decided that Amazon was the best alternative.  We enjoyed watching the movie and I was pleased with the quality of the DVD.
B008Y7BE7E|4.0|Zombiland is a great take on one of the most beloved genre of movies. Funny with plenty of action and told in a whole new way.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have always loved playing this game at carnivals and this is even better! I don't like to spend money on games so I love that you can &quot;sell&quot; back prizes you have duplicates of for more coins.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I usually like stories that take a creative license with history but this movie missed on all cylinders. Bad script, bad acting, terrible plot.  There were a lot of unusual action sceans but overall the movie is amost unwatchable.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 5 year old LOVES this one! Whenever I need to entertain him on a car ride or when shopping, I just hand him my Kindle with this app open &amp; he is happy!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I bought this as a part of My Doctor Who costume. Loved it, inexpensive and fun! The piece that extends it does seem a  bit flimsy however and the plate covering the screw, to change the batteries, has a tendency to pop off. But other than that its great!
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Instead of going to a store, I opted to buy this online and I'm glad I did. The CD was a gift, and it came within 3-5 days of making the order on Amazon, so it was a great experience!
B00979CS50|5.0|Have been a Neil Young and a Crazy Horse fan since I first heard Comes A Time when I was about 13 years old. I have pretty much everything he/they have put out...some of it certainly falls short of the mark...we all agree with that. But after quite enjoying Americana and then reading Waging Heavy Peace where Young talks about wanting to record with Crazy Horse again but only if the songs were right, I just knew this album would be the one!<br /><br />Since buying it two weeks ago I just haven't stopped listening to it. Walk Like A Giant is stunning and I think will become a staple of his live shows just as Hey, Hey, My, My has become...in some ways the thunderous, crunching guitars are eerily similar. Ramada Inn is another gem. In time I think we'll look back at these two songs in particular and hold them up there with the best that Neil and Crazy Horse have ever written and released.<br /><br />Listening to this album has inspired me to go back to all my old Neil Young stuff and get back into it...can't believe I didn't even have it all on my iPod!<br /><br />There is just so much to love about this album for the fans. And when I thought it couldn't get any better I found out that Neil and The Horse are coming to Australia and playing here in WA in March next year...assuming I get a ticket it'll be the fourth time I've seen them...and I just know that this will be THE experience of a lifetime.<br /><br />Thanks to Neil and Crazy Horse for this album...
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is great. I consider myself to be quite good at solitaire and love that this isn't super easy.
B000VYNYN0|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite older movies. I cant wait for the remake only because Bruce Campbell is a part of it.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This is just another jewel drop game with a bit of gathering-up quest.<br />If you are sitting in a waiting room, dentist, doctor or airport, it will keep you occupied. One annoying thing for Kindle Fire players is that the game screen covers the Kindle menu bar, so it can be difficult to get out of the game and back to the Kindle page.<br />I got it free tho, so it was worth that.....
B00555Z6Q8|5.0|Belle and Sebastian have long held my heart with their music.  This particular album was a must-have for my vinyl collection, and would recommend it whole-heartedly to anyone seeking good music.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This movie was more about the evolution showing what we could have developed if mankind had not chosen it's path.<br />I could easily see a sequel to this movie because there was so much left open, I'd put this movie right up there with the greats i.e. Jurasic Park, Avatar, and the Matrix. See the trailer: [...]
B009KYXEY6|1.0|The album would be perfect if it came with \\"Without You\\" \\"Lucky Ones\\" and \\"Lolita.\\" From what I hear it's happened to other people too, I don't understand what Lana has against US fans.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this app it is so good! a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|If u need some relax @ short time such like breaks time or long breaks I like to play this app, more details than other similar game
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I know the book was considered the \\"mommy porn\\", but it was actually a very beautiful, romantic story.  To find a man like that today would be a dream come true!  The changes they make in one another is astounding.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game at the beginning.  Got up to level 51, but then they did a mega update.  Now I can only play for 2 min. before it completely freezes and I have to turn the kindle off to even get to the main menu.  Had to take off my kindle cuz I was afraid it would damage it with it's glitches.  Maybe taking it off and putting it back on will make it work.  Really liked it, glad I don't put money into games.  Was really disappointed when it froze:-(
B005MMYCY6|1.0|Hard to have any feelings for the titled name character.  Gordon-Levitt is good as always in a very bad film.
0802473156|5.0|I heard about this book completely randomly (aka the Lord put it in my life for a reason) I have always been asked why I was getting upset at previous boyfriends and I never knew how to put it into words. Come to find out none of them were speaking my love language. This book gives great insight into yourself and also how to love a significant other. I recommend this book to anyone in a relationship no matter it be dating or married for years. It is an easy read!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|If I could give the movie a higher rating I would do that. I have watched Battleship many times and my friends are amazed as I am.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I've been a big fan of The Walking Dead since Season 1.  Past seasons have had high points, and lulls.  This third season is action-packed with plenty of surprises and twists to get and maintain interest.<br /><br />Being a Dish customer, I started this season without AMC, so subscribed to Season 3 on Amazon.  Dish and AMC came to terms and I get the episodes as they premier, but have still kept my subscription to Amazon because this season's story line is so compelling, I know I will want to watch it over again.<br /><br />Quality on Amazon is top-notch.  Fans of TWD won't go wrong.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|Fascinating story, amazing characters, excellent writing. Loved it.<br />Would certainly recommend to my friends who are serious readers and don't mind long books,<br />took me almost a month to finish it. Glad I bought it. Wish there was a sequel.<br />I also wish for kindle editions to have numbered pages and not only percentage displayed.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Moffett is a genius! The screenplay is a very updated and exciting. I very good reading on the original from Conan Doyle.
B002SAUCBC|1.0|Is it too much to ask for an ending?  I read the whole book very quickly and was left feeling robbed at the end.  This was the first time I had taken a chance on Stephen King for a while and this has not got me running out to buy another.
B005LAIHSG|3.0|I didn't see this movie in the theaters. I didn't buy the DVD. I rented it. With Kristen Stewart in one of the lead roles, I was skeptical as to how good it could possibly be. I guess a pretty face is enough for a few moviegoers, but most of us expect more.<br /><br />So many reviewers have already gone into the details of the story here, I won't add to that. Instead, I'll stick to what I think works and doesn't work about the film overall.<br /><br />What works: Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron. Both are outstanding actors portraying complex, interesting characters--but their talents are wasted here. Stewart is an albatross around their necks--as one reviewer here noted, Hemsworth seemed to be pleading in his scenes with her for something, anything for him to work with. Both he and Theron have to carry her in every scene they share.<br /><br />Stewart has one facial expression, even in her \\"death\\" scene. She always looks constipated. Acting must be a painful process for her. I can only hope if there's a sequel, it will be focused on the Huntsman, as has been rumored.  I could also see a film delving into Ravenna's past--the glimpses of her childhood in the film were intriguing.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Very Well written. I loved the insight into where Master Chief came from. Looking forward to the other books by Eric Nylund
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Given that this has the same source material as the latest Nolan-Batman movie, I have no reservations in comparing the two.  This one was better.  from what I remember of the graphic novel, this was faithful the book but without the really blocky sequential feel.<br /><br />The delivery of lines and the are art were both beautifully done and my wife and I had a blast watching it.  Our 2 year old, who we probably shouldn't have let watch this with us, but who also loves Batman, also seemed to enjoy it.
1419705849|5.0|Bestselling author Jeff Kinney has done it again as he entertains throughout this charming story in the seventh installment of 'Diary Of A Wimpy Kid.' An exciting series that both children and adults love, including me. It's Valentine's Day in Greg's middle school, and to the guys and girls, it's a Big important event that they will forever remember, especially at this age. Greg and his best friend are out- and- about, sweating with worry to get a date, and the longer they hunt, the more nervous they become. The search becomes top priority as they look for girls to escort to the date, leaving Greg with good news as he finds one, and Rowley is left out in the cold. But, as the thrilling evening moves forward in a much anticipated wait, things are about to change. Is there love in the air, and who becomes the lucky guy? How does the dance turn out, and who gets what they wished for? The author delivers 224 pages of pure delight as we follow Greg and his friends in a heartwarming and funny story, filled with unexpected surprises, and twists-and-turns.  Another winner has been created in this beloved series with adorable characters as the author portrays the ups-and-downs in life with all its challenges. Very Enjoyable, Educational, and Highly Recommended!
B005I2YL4G|4.0|I bought this to build a HTPC and was hoping that I'd be able to get a SteamBox out of it as well.  I didn't get a SteamBox, but I got a great HTPC.  I do my Blu Ray/DVD ripping on a different computer, so this processor is just doing playback and it's handled full 1080 Blu Ray mkv rips no problem.<br /><br />I have overscan issues with my TV running Vista (this is relevant because of the GPU in the die).  I cannot see the task bar and other edges of the screen.  This isn't a major issue because XBMC has a separate calibration to change where content is displayed.  Sometimes the drivers change the calibration and the whole desktop is displayed with a border of unused pixels on the TV.  I really don't like that, so I stick with not showing everything.<br /><br />I tried to boot up BioShock and couldn't get the game to boot - it complained about things which seemed to be related to the video card.  In the end, I didn't try very hard to get it to work because (1) it wasn't super important to me and (2) I figured the issue might be related to Vista and I was only using it because I had an extra copy lying around.
B003204MQS|1.0|This movie was hyped up to be incredibly scary so when I watched it with my girlfriend I kept saying \\"wait for it. It'll get scary soon\\" I kept saying that then next thing I knew the credits were rolling and I wasn't scared at all.
1612680011|2.0|Just because its a best seller doesn't mean its a best read<br />Review<br /><br />He admits that he's not a good writer (and he isn't) but the book was interesting enough to keep me reading. It had many typos but all in all it wasn't too bad. Some of the advice (let your bills slide if need be) was awful. He also talks about taking big risks for big gains when investing where everything else I've read has said otherwise. Maybe its just not practical advice for a student with a paltry income like myself but it really seems risky for anyone that doesn't have a disposable income. I finished reading this book the day that he filed bankruptcy (2012) because he was sued for 20 million from the company who sets  up his speaking engagements (look it up online don't take my word for it). Its reported that he has 80 mil so why didn't he pay? Also he spends a lot of time in the book casually mentioning his flashy car,his wife's flashy car and his designer suits. This serves no purpose except to maybe evoke envy from certain readers. He goes into specific brands when name dropping status symbols but never went into specifics of how much he gave to charity even though he mentions its important to give to charity (in general the poor donate more of their income to charity than the rich). He spends a small portion of the book explaining that the rich hire lawyers to avoid taxes because the lawyers are less expensive than paying taxes. None of this has anything to do with me learning how to make $ work for me. Must be how he was able to file for bankruptcy even though he's loaded.<br /><br />Best part of the book<br /><br />The book  helps you understand the mindset of a capitalist.<br /><br />The few historical facts he mentioned were helpful. It reminded me that wealthy men fail and that older men like Colonel Saunders have become wealthy when they were older. I'm 29 and many finance books make me feel like I'm doomed because I didn't begin to take control of my finances in my early 20's.<br /><br />Bottom line he gives risky advice and mostly talks about how smart he was to learn how to build wealth young and invest in real estate. It would make more sense if he wrote this book about making $ in real estate but its mostly a book about him bragging about his ability to make money. If you buy this I would get it used because from an ethical standpoint this man doesn't need any more money and more importantly this book is terrible. last time I  checked the audio version  was free on the most popular video website, you....<br /> I took notes of the most useful information and had 2 pages when I was done and of that information only about a paragraph was financial advice which it now turns out was misguided. I own free kindle books that gave better financial advice. So far this is the worst finance book I've ever read.<br /><br />2 stars for keeping it interesting enough to turn the page and for the small amount of historical facts regarding finance leaders. Its more like a 1 star book but I found the historical facts to be very inspiring.isky advice and mostly talks about how smart he was to learn how to build wealth young and invest in real estate.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was amazing. I literally could not stop reading. It is so well-crafted, well-written, and it's like nothing I've ever read before. It is a unique piece of fiction.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|I like the music even though while driving to work it is somewhat anxiety producing. I was VERY disappointed that the soundtrack would not include the theme song. I should have read about this CD more carefully before purchasing.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good poolside story, love his writing but this not his best work.  I liked the surprises along the way
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Hilarious and smart, I'm pretty sure we would be friends. Plus, as a 30 Rock fan, it was fun to get an inside look at the process. Highly recommend!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Typical series type story line but a nice read anyway. I enjoy all his books but this is not his best
B0034G4OYA|4.0|There are so many animated features coming out daily and a lot of them hardly even qualify to be called mediocre.  Hotel Transylvania has a very cliched story line but it delivers it in a funny and original way.  You'll be laughing the whole movie!
B008Y212PI|5.0|I look forward every morning to play this game. challenging and makes you think. Cant put it down. I have found a great time passer.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun to play I just wish you did not need the help of your friends to get you through the game such as completing the building you are required to have for gameplay.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Mumford and Sons is back again with Babel. I will be the first to admit that many of the songs on this album have a similar feel to those on the first album, Sigh No More. This is not necessarily a bad thing though! I could not get enough of M&S's first album, so this was exactly what I wanted from them. If you did not like the first album, this one will definitely not convert you into a M&S fan, but for those like myself who just wanted more, this album fulfills that need.
B006UKC566|5.0|If you watch this movie in a real 3D screen you can feel like in a theater. It´s unbelievable. I recommended this movie to people likes Greek mythology.
B007OWRBJK|3.0|There is no denying the genius that is Pete Townshend.  And he writes as well as he plays guitar and writes songs.  I found this book to be exhausting due to his manic, manic behavior, but I could not put it down.  Worth every angst written word and The Who fans will eat it up.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I thought the action scenes were pretty awesome, but the movie would've been a little bit more enjoyable without the nudity. I'll never understand why people think things can't be entertaining without it.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Wow, super intense show! Really good writing, excellent acting, one of the best!! I had caught an episode of season 2 by accident, and got immediately hooked. Even though I knew how it turned out, it was still very exciting to watch season 1. And it definitely helped fill in the back story. I don't want to give anything away about the story, but it will definitely surprise you. Claire Daines is awesome, really powerful acting. As is the entire cast. Top notch! I wish I hadn't caught up, now I have to wait for more!
B0031RAOW8|5.0|This beautiful tale is being advertised as \\"family and children\\".  It is NOT for children unless you want to break their hearts.  Lovely story,  but I would wait until all children viewing it are at least 12 years old, and I would watch it first myself to determine its suitability to the emotional maturity level of all potential viewers.  This statement attests to the quiet power of this movie.
0316228532|3.0|One lovely evening in Pagford, a councilman and his wife go out to dinner to celebrate their wedding anniversary. The man, Barry Fairbrother, aged forty four, suddenly dies right on the street. Leaving behind, his shocked wife and a town in turmoil.<br /><br />This novel is an in-depth look at the lives, pain, dreams, crimes, abuse, and more that can be found in any group of humans. Ms. Rowling writes in clear, and unvarnished terms just how desperate a community can become when life feels unfair.<br /><br />This book was well written and the characters well drawn, however, it is a bit rough for my taste. That is just me, however, and the story does compel you to continue to see what ending will come to the individuals involved.<br /><br />It is an adult book and not for under 17, in my opinion.
B000GWE44U|1.0|Considering this is an iconic horror film, it was awful. Jack was terrific and so was the cast, but the movie was slow and draggy. I cannot understand what all the fuss was about. My wife told me we'd love it. And it had its moments. Perhaps it could be that both film and production values have gotten SO much better, that this seemed out of place. Nope, that's not it. I can watch a Hitchcock film and enjoy it as much as I did back in the day. But really, rent or buy something else. Unless you just need sleep. In that case, it is perfect.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I have a ton of fun playing this. I like the hardest level best. I recommend this game to anyone.
B0016J81B4|3.0|I was very excited when i got this product.  However after my first shift of using them i noticed that they just werent that comfortable.  They have these nubs inside at the toe section of the croc that seem to rub my toes raw.  But they were VERY effective at gripping a wet floor.  Im hoping that after a while they will break in but i wont hold my breath.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Martin crafts a totally new world, replete with flawed heroes, despicable villains, detailed pageantry, and unique kingdoms.  Anyone who has enjoyed Tolkien and Bernard Cornwell's early English sagas will savor this series.  With each chapter dedicated to the perspective of a singular character, the stories move quickly and deftly interweave multiple plot lines, rather reminiscent of the &#34;cliff-hanger&#34; serials of the 30's and 40's.  I look forward to reading the entire saga.
B004O2AZHI|5.0|I've had my eye on this 1 so I thought I would buy it to check it out. it was very nice anima.
B00979CS50|5.0|Still delivering after 30-some albums--epic, sprawling West Coast psychedelic roots rock from a<br />  legendary master.  Young & Crazy Horse bring the goods here with an energy & sincerity that<br />  belies their age and accentuates their talent.  With several songs around the 20 minute mark, the<br />  band has ample room to stretch out and play.  The songs are on a par with much of their early<br />  material.  Young's voice is strong, and the passion & immediacy of the guitar interplay burns as<br />  impressively as it did in 1969.  Really, an incredibly strong rock album!
0307949508|5.0|The Girl Who Played With Fire, sequel to The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a \\"must\\" for people who love a tingling read.<br /><br />I've been reading, and enjoying thrillers for years. Almost all have a male protagonist and those that feature a woman make sure she is a reporter, lawyer.  The usual.  But I've never met a woman like Lisbeth Salander.  She is unique as is the way author Stieg Larsson presents the story.<br /><br />The premise is: two murder victims were about to expose the secrets of the Swedish sex trade.  The other is the prominent attorney the court chose to be Lizbeth's guardian after her incompetence hearing--a man we (readers) have met before when he abused his power in a most horrendous way.<br /><br />With three people dead and Lisbeth's fingerprints on the murder weapon, Lizbeth is laying low while her friends Mikael Blomvkist (journalist with a Swedish national magazine) and others try to prove her innocence.  Soon both Lizbeth and Mikael are searching for a mystery man named Zala.<br /><br />There are a lot of twists and surprises.  Prepare to spend a sleepless night or two.
B0042KA5EK|5.0|If you loved the season1, you are going to love thi season too. The quality image is great, the only bad thing is that you can not download it directly to you computer, you always have to watch it online
B004J4WKDI|5.0|I loved the book.  It started off slow and wasn't what I would call a page turner but it was very sensory and incredibly interesting the way it has different chapters being written from different characters and view points.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it.  I read it for my book club and every one of us ended up loving it.
B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Will not open after numerous  attempts and various troubleshooting techniques. Very dissappointed, kids were looking forward to playing this one.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Trying to finish the novel before the movie. Cause the books are always better. Cannot wait to see what happens next. So glad I purchased this book.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down .It was excellent . Can't wait for book three to come out in May. Shared the book with co-workers who thought it was great
B009KHBDUU|4.0|Great entertainment , Great casting , Great Music . Watch it more than once to get all the entertainment values that are offered . . .
B009NOVCTM|2.0|Shame on you Mick and the boys, yet another album with all the songs we old fans have<br />had for years except for the 2 new ones, are Stones really that money greedy or is it the<br />record company forcing Stones to release such record, I just wonder. The Stones gave us a<br />fantastic bonus cd with Some Girls so for sure they have many more unreleased songs in vaults<br />which should have been released instead to celebrate their anniverssary. I have been a Stones<br />fan from their very first day but now I'm greatly disappointed about the way they are treating<br />their real and old fans.<br />Sorry folks but this album is a non go.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book stole my life for two days because I absolutely could not put it down until I finished. It really brings to light the importance of love and companionship during a time of suffering. I shed some tears while I read but it was a privilege to have this book break my heart.
B00005JKNF|3.0|started out to be a decent mystery, but it really is a tale of the corrupt norms of the upper class. For me it had too much sex going on. The casual attitudes toward it detracted<br />from the enjoyment of the story but were an<br />integral part of it. Enjoyed Maggie Smith & Jeremy Northam immensely as always though.
B00910Y1OQ|1.0|I really enjoyed this game until I accidentally tapped &quot;new game&quot;. All of my progress was lost. What happened to asking &quot; are you sure?&quot; Such a simple little thing to correct. That alone takes it from a 5 star rating to a 1.
B0009K7ESW|1.0|The title of this review says it all. The dvd tells how an architect (artist) proposes to decorate the plaza of the Boston city hall with a garden area based on the inspiration of Ma's performance of Bach's music for unaccompanied cello. So what I got was pictures of the proposal, narration (bla-bla-bla) with background of Ma's playing and also episodes of him playing out in the boondocks. I'll bet Ma wishes he'd never got roped into this piece of nonsense. I'll stick to listening and creating my own images, thank you!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Absolutely fabulous read! Beautiful story line, great twists along the way and a main character that is so intriguing. 5 STARS!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|We're only 7 episodes into the season and I've already ordered it on DVD. Keep up the awesome work. Love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game people are just like zombies they look at the cover and say it is bad if they just try it they wide like it.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|Disappointing. Long. Lacking in many ways. This film needed more \\"life.\\" Too \\"flat\\" in many respects. The Huntsman is rather lame. Snow White could have been much more likeable and purposeful. If you can watch it for free, perhaps. The entire film is rather dark in terms of lighting.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|I know this is one of those books that's going to keep resurfacing in my mind over the next few weeks. Reading it, is like going through someone's acid trip, and you have absolutely no idea where you're headed or where you're going to end up. A pretty brilliant premise, (all the gods of legend and myth are alive and well and scraping by in modern day America), that is as provocative as it is highly entertaining. Surely will be a book talked about and studied for years to come.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was a great ending to an awesome trilogy! She rounds off all the edges and what if's! A must read!!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|What happened? Far too much introspection and chest-beating . . . far too little genuine character development and storyline energy.  Cornwell's standard cast of characters wander around, lost in petty stereotypical self analysis and cliched situation definition.  Looking for an intriguing, engaging read, I instead found humdrum and numbing narrative.  Truly disappointing.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is such an awesome app.  I love to play it in my free time!I hope they make more games like this!

B000SEGMAU|5.0|This is a classic! I recently lost my husband to ALS. This book did not make me sad or mourn harder, but rather took me back through the many good conversations we had until his speech was taken from him. I highly recommend it for just about anybody.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a great book - moves at exactly the right pace to keep one interested and engaged.  I genuinely wanted to know what had happened and found it difficult to put the book down.  I appreciated knowing how long it was, so I could judge how long it would take me to read it.

B000VMFDW2|5.0|Great book with first hand information. The author did not try to present himself as the hero of the book, but was very honest and straightforward about the reality of war.<br /><br />Any combat veteran would especially appreciate this book. Well written, from a \\"grunt's\\" perspective.\\"

B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love anything Grisham, have read everything he has written, and couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  I was not disappointed!  This book was fast paced and an easy read.  I couldn't put it down.  Baldwin/Bannister was a cool character and I loved him right away and I loved how he outsmarted and played the system.  I highly recommend \\"The Racketeer.\\"  Way to go Grisham!
0062073486|5.0|It's good, it's really good.<br /><br />Although, there is some pen writing on it, but it's really doesn't matter<br /><br />I like it, and I bought it 'Used before' but it's good :-)
0316017930|4.0|If you like Malcolm Gladwell's other books you will like this one. I think some of the other book reviews are a little too harsh. This book is about illustrating that IN ADDITION to the traditional values we attribute to success (hard work, intelligence, integrity) opportunity is also critical.<br /><br />The book takes you through several different types of examples of how opportunity plays a part is the success of the greatest achievers. Opportunity can include being in the right place, at the right time, or even of the right cultural heritage. I do not feel that in anyway the book down played the need of the traditional values.<br /><br />Similar to his other books, I finish it trying to determine how I might apply the information. In this case, I suspect that the biggest lesson I will take away is that we need to help people find and recognize the best opportunities in their environment. The most successful people are those who combine the traditional values with the greatest opportunities.
B000001GYC|2.0|To be fair, the other recording by him I was disappointed by was of a set of pieces which I have only heard one pianist do justice to. Still, I feel like he has missed the mark on these as well.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book! I finished it in 2 days and then read it all over again. I liked the way the book was written. It held my attention from the start to the end. I can't wait for Walking Disaster to come out to see things from Travis' point of view. I am really hoping that WD will go more into details of Travis and Abby's life together. This is all together a GREAT book!!!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|While I do have a 3-D Blu-ray player, I don't have a 3-D TV (hello, Santa!), but the combo was at such an awesome price on Amazon, I couldn't pass it up.  The regular Blu-ray delivers great sounds and sights and the DVD works well on the old school tube TV in the bedroom.  If I had my life to live over, I would probably still by this.
B0064O927I|5.0|Bougth this item for my husband's birthday and he loved it.  It has a timer, alarm, date functions all controlled by two finger tips.  Everything is touch screen so it's sleek and nice w/o the buttons.  The watch is thin and works well on my husband since he doesn't have bulky wrists.  I think the only con my husband had was that the date isn't on the original screen with the time.  But you can just slide the bottom of the screen and and choose to see the date.  Amazon shipped this item fast and it came directly to our house with no problms.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I have not seen any of these and I have wanted to watch The Shield for the longest time. The problem was there was not a complete set before this and to buy the seasons individually would have been at a great expense. So First I would like to say thank you for putting this together and at a reasonable price. I was a little hesitant to buy this because I read about glue and scratches on the discs on arrival. I then read about sleeves that they included to fix the problem. Then in the middle was reviews talking about sleeves did not work. My desire to watch this series made me want to roll the dice and take my chances. I got the package and there is a plastic sleeve that holds the box and it is slightly damaged. It's not a major deal its probably just from being moved around and what not. The box is set up like a book. It has the cover as it is displayed with a cool looking badge on the front you open it up and it has artwork which I will include pictures at a later time. I was like where are the discs? I noticed they are in the pages with cut outs. I pulled out the first disc and it came out with a white sleeve on it which I guess was the protective sleeve people were talking about in other reviews. It is a white plastic / paper material that kind of static clings to the disc. Awesome for protection, however I am afraid I might lose it while the disc is in the DVD player. I inspected the disc and it appeared to have some stuff on it. I think its fuzz or something because I easily removed it, after that the disc looked flawless. I inspected the discs up to about season 3 and they all appeared to be in pristine condition. I decided to stop. I have yet to watch any of them at this time and will update this review if I encounter any problems. This is a pretty cool thing for a collector. I have it displayed in a DVD case but it is wide and takes up a whole shelf for itself. If I had to say something negative about it, it would be that I do not like how the discs are housed. But there is no major problems with it that would constitute a deal breaker for me.d. But there is no major problems with it that would constitute a deal breaker for me.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|This book was recommended to me and I loved it. Well written and cleverly brings the reader into a hint of what it would be like to develop Alzheimers.
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|I recently watched this movie and the first 20 minutes of this movie was quite compelling.  Once the character roles were established the movie went quickly down from the there.  The movie had great potential and the story was well constructed in theory.<br /><br />Charlize Theron's performance was stillted and unconvincing.  I wonder if she actually contributed more than just her name.  She is a way better actor than this; she could have really delivered more.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth were a little better, but certainly it seems as if the director was not encouraging their best efforts.  Kristen Stewart had several believable moments but this movie needed more.<br /><br />So 2 stars and what movie was I reviewing again?  It's that forgettable.
1844006298|5.0|This book epitomizes Peggy Porschen's wonderful cake decorating style - elegant, inventive and so chic.  I adore this book and all of her books.
0399157565|1.0|ive read all the books and i look forward to reading this one. i have a few worries though about the character. when cornwell suddenly brought scarpetta's \\"military\\" past out in the last book, i was like, wait hold on.. really? loyal fans have been around for 20 years, you think in one of those books, especially the ones with first person narrative, that she would have mentioned SOMETHING about this military past. there wasnt one mention. more and more i feel like patricia cornwell lives through scarpetta. she even has the character look like her. i felt that way from the first book on, but at the same time i love the stories and characters so i figure if it works for her, fine. but the military stuff was totally out of left field and seemed pretty fake. i miss scarpetta making food and feeding her pet squirrel-- before he was killed :( -- and enjoying her relationship with benton.
B007JVJ3C4|4.0|Not really a great movie, but it is alot of fun.  The 3D was well done and made the movie worth watching.
B008NEMN0K|2.0|5 stars goes to JVC for working on a faster way to convert 2d to 3D on the fly.<br />ZERO stars for fox inc for changing the movie from its ORIGINAL aspect ratio.<br />in most scenes the background was not converted to save time, other scenes...about 25% ish were ok, the rest just SUCKED.<br /><br />over all the people that are calming this to be the best conversion ever are obviously employees of fox inc just trying to promote it. and they are just a bunch of LAIRS!
B009KKLQKO|5.0|I saw the Beach Boys July 9, 2012 and it was awesome.  The sound was as good as any live show I have ever seen.  The Beach Boys have aged but all use their present vocal strengths to create a sound greater than the sum of its parts, that I think was better live than any other live tour they have ever done.  Camera crews were there so I was excited to be able to watch this amazing concert at home.<br /><br />Since others are reviewing a product they have neither seen or heard, I am reviewing the trailer and concert I actually saw.  To get 20 some songs in perfect sound for $11 is hardly a rip off.  I do hope they release the other songs as well, but that does not take away from what this collection is-20 some songs performed by the Beach Boys and their amazing band in great sound.  If it were 50 songs, we'd be paying $30.  Just sayin'.
B003O86FMW|5.0|ach page of each of the Hunger games books is well written and gripping. Each chapter demands that you continue on to the next. Suzanne Collins did an amazing job creating a world that and crafting characters that feel as real and as alive our communities and friends.  Ordering books for the Kindle app on the Ipad is an instantly gratifying and rewarding process.
B0094JLUOI|3.0|UK Pop star Robbie Williams discovers his inner U2/Coldplay on album number nine \\"Take The Crown\\". Songs like the gently pulsing pair of \\"Hunting For You\\" (with the line \\"Everything I like's illegal, seductive, addictive, immoral, corrosive, destructive\\"), and \\"Into The Silence\\", the racing shimmery rocker \\"Not Like The Others\\", and \\"Reverse\\" (with a catchy \\"Ooooh oooh oooh\\" refrain) are prime examples.<br /><br />Lead-single \\"Candy\\" is catchy chirpy pop co-written by his Take That band mate Gary Barlow, and it's already topped the UK singles charts. The simplistic \\"Hey Wow Yeah Yeah\\" is a fun-filled raucous rocker which recalls Williams of the past. \\"Losers\\" is an affecting acoustic Folky ballad, a duet with Lissie\\" (\\"There will always be someone better than you even if you're the best, So let's stop the competition now, or we will both be losers\\") , while the lovely \\"Eight Letters\\" is a spare piano ballad with his voice really soaring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the rest of the album is rather too safe and forgettable which is a real shame. A song like the clubby \\"All That I want\\" sounds like it's about to get interesting but doesn't, while \\"Different\\" tries to be another \\"Angels\\" but never quite takes wing. Still, the good moments are quite good. 3 and a half stars.

B0096I9UTE|4.0|Australian Pop singer Kylie Minogue's new album finds her re-recording previous hits of hers at the famed Abbey Road studios, in orchestral or Folky arrangements, as well as including a lone new song, the spare string-swathed \\"Flower\\" (with percussion and full band sweeping in after the first chorus).<br /><br />For the most part it works, better than it should with enough sonic variety to keep things interesting. \\"On A Night Like This\\" is reborn swinging cabaret style and shows her displaying more nuance and range than she's usually credited with. \\"Better The Devil You Know\\" is a spare piano ballad with a lovely guitar break and heavenly harmonies, while \\"Hand On Your Heart\\" becomes a melancholic quitar-driven Folky lament.<br /><br />\\"Come Into My World\\" is a spare piano ballad, the stunning \\"Finer Feelings\\" is atmospheric string-swathed Trip Hop, the similar \\"Confide In Me\\" is ominous and haunting alternating between hushed and epic, \\"Slow\\" is a Jazzy shuffle with vampy vocals, \\"The Locomotion\\" is given a Motown bounce, \\"Where The Wild Roses Grow\\" is more acoustic and still features Nick Cave paired with her, \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" is lush and string-swathed, \\"Love At First Sight\\" is a charming ballad, while \\"Never Too Late\\" shows that stripped of the synths and thumping beats, there is a lovely piano ballad beneath. This album is a pleasant surprise.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|This movie really moves you. I recommend it completely. The gut wrenching emotions that it  evokes are strong and honest.
B009B4ZEKM|4.0|After experiencing a career rebirth of sorts piggy backing on Maroon 5's smash \\"Moves Like Jagger\\", Christina Aguilera's \\"Lotus\\" rides on the wave of that success. Lead-single \\"Your Body\\" is a sweaty stomper that takes no prisoners with its addictive \\"Oh oh oh\\" refrain.<br /><br />\\"Lotus Intro\\" is rather trippy with intricate vocal layering and slowed electro beats. The Dance/Rock \\"Army Of Me\\" is the \\"Fighter\\" of the album, with the lines ''There's a thousand faces of me, and we're gonna rise up... for every time you wronged me, Well, you're gonna face an army, army of me\\" set to angry thumping beats. \\"Red Hot Kinda Love\\" is a playful retro-tinged groove, the Electro Funk \\"Make The World Move\\" features her Voice co-coach Cee-Lo Green (though he is criminally under-utilized, you hardly notice he's there), the catchy \\"Let There Be Love\\" is Techno with stabbing synths, \\"Around The World\\" is set to Hip Hop/Martial beats, while \\"Shut Up\\" is a sulky rocker set to Hip Hop Beats. There's nothing as tuneless as \\"Woohoo\\" or \\"Elastic Love\\" thankfully.<br /><br />The rest of the album comprises ballads, with the Country-tinged \\"Just A Fool\\" featuring another Voice co-coach Blake Shelton. For those who like a good holler, there's \\"Sing For Me\\", sure to be a regular on future episodes of The Voice, X Factor, or Idol. The best ballads though are The spare piano ballad \\"Blank Page\\" which finds her confessing \\"I know there's pain, but people change, Lord knows I've been no saint\\", the epic \\"Cease Fire\\" which is set to skittery martial beats, the rather lovely guitar-driven Pink-style \\"Circles\\" which finds her inviting some unlucky person to \\"Spin around in circles on my middle finger\\", and the anthemic \\"Best Of Me\\".<br /><br />It's not quite the blockbuster it could have been (the tracklist could do with a little trimming), but still, a welcome return to form.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very well written book from someone who is not a professional writer. Provides the reader with a good overview of what military operations are like. After reading this book you will appreciate what these brave men and woman do for us. They willing put themselves in harm's way so we can live free, leaving family, loved ones and friends behind to do their duty. God Bless them and keep them safe.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|\\"I Will Always Love you: The Best Of Whitney Houston\\" is a concise single disc collection of some of her hits; a smattering of tracks from the albums \\"Whitney Houston\\", \\"Whitney\\", \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\", \\"Bodyguard\\", \\"Waiting To Exhale\\", \\"The Preacher's Wife\\", \\"My Love Is Your Love\\", and her last album \\"I Look To You\\", including all her US number 1s. It's great to have the tracks remastered, especially the \\"Whitney\\" and \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" tracks. The version of \\"I'm Your Baby Tonight\\" is the swinging horn-peppered version, not the Club version, and \\"I Believe In You And Me\\" is the movie version.<br /><br />Also included are an alternate take on \\"I Look To You\\", stripped and more somber with mainly piano and featuring alternate vocals by Whitney, the vocals of R. Kelly, and some faint calming choir in the background. The \\"We love you Whitney, rest in peace\\" at the end is rather cheesy though and should have been left off. The final cut is a new recording, a mid tempo R&B song \\"Never Give Up\\" with inspirational lyrics, similar in feel to \\"Worth It' or \\"I Got You\\". Sung in the lower throatier register of her last few years, it sounds like something recorded during the sessions of her last album. I love both songs.<br /><br />I don't know if these songs will be enough to make people want to buy this when \\"Whitney: The Greatest Hits\\" is more extensive, but the bonus disc of the Deluxe edition has loads more tracks, even including her duet with Aretha \\"It Isn't, It Wasn't, It Ain't Never Gonna Be\\". Fans will definitely want this.
B0098460O4|5.0|Received Charlotte and Jonathan's \\"Together\\" CD.  I have listened to it at least three times a day. For those of you who don't think you like \\"opera\\", this CD will blow you away - many of the songs are ones you will recognize, just sung in a different way.  I love every song, which is sometimes hard to say about a lot of CD's.  Usually there are mediocre songs thrown in with the good ones.  This CD is a winner all the way.  Can't wait for their next release.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|Les Miserables is my favorite musical ever. I was so glad that they released the 25th Anniversary Concert in Blu-ray. It definitely makes a difference in crisp color and clarity. I was in tears within the first five minutes from Jean Valjean's impassioned singing. The only cast choice that was poor in my opinion was Nick Jonas. For me, Nick Jonas was not up to par in tone, passion, and overall skill to play Marius. But perhaps this was a choice to encourage young (or very young) viewers. Katie Barks did very well as Cosette, but Samantha Barks for me, was not inspiring Eponine. One thing to note, this version is focused on the singing, so there is very little acting with most actors standing in front of microphones for most of the show.<br />All in all, I would recommend this DVD--the Blu-ray version is definitely worth it and a special treat is seeing some of the older cast members!
B0068LYEHA|1.0|I have never paid for a book that I didn't read to completion as a rule.  I deleted this one after suffering thru 6 chapters as I felt it was a waste of time to read.  I just didn't get anything from it.  It really doesn't read like a story--more like a diary/blog thrown into book format.  I feel bad I wasted 8 bucks on this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|kept my interest for a good long while. Much longer than any other game of this type.

B008Q7O6VS|5.0|I mainly bought this set for the live concert and I have to say the remastering is awesome too.Nice editions with the postcards and poster. This is going to make a kick ass xmas present for a few friends.<br /><br />Well worth it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I didn't want to put this book down! I started it on day 1 of my cruise and on day 7 I was downloading Book Two!  I am in love with Christian Grey - kinkiness and all because he truly does seem to have such a caring heart!  I'm half way through book 2 and loving it even more!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was very unimpressed by this book. He consistently refers to himself as a doctor scientist, but offers little by way of anything scientific in his book. I realize there are many books about a near death experience, but cannot help but think they all lack any real reason to believe in heaven. I truly think we should all treat each other as well as possible, even complete strangers. That to me is pretty basic and doesn't require a belief in a supreme being, or a heaven. The life everyone portrays in Heaven is not that interesting, and since you will not be in any kind of decision making state, it hardly matters what your living conditions are. I read this book on my Kindle Fire. To me a superb way to read and far superior to hard cover reading. I recommend this to anyone, trying to stay abreast of the latest in really interesting books.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I was unsure at first if it would be any good but I was impressed. Ben Affleck did a fine job. The other actors were great. I would recommend it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season starts strong. There is a feeling of time having passed between seasons with the characters leveling up. Carl is awesome as is the scene with the zombies in body armor. There is very little carrying of the idiot ball done by the cast.<br /><br />Loved it
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I'd read this book in less than a week, I usually take my time and enjoy it. The characters in my opinion just became insignificant to me and lost the interest to finish the book. For example Peeta's characteristic just became a total havoc and Katniss ignorance just annoyed me. The previous two books were great, I actually enjoyed reading those compared to the last book. I feel like the author rushed the whole thing and destroyed the main characters.<br /><br />*Spoiler Alert do not continue reading* The ending is okay was a bit depressing. I wasn't satisfied with the ending at all. The two did end up together.
B002N2SYWE|5.0|I guess i didnt read the description all the way through , it was in subtitles. Still great original idea which you cant find with Hollywood anymore.  Gory but good! Some scenes pretty intense but great if you are a true horror fan! Definitely recommend!

B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the style in which the book was written. It was suspenseful and kept me from wanting to put the book down. I wasn't entirely thrilled with the ending, but up until then I thought it was a great book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't usually read sci-fi but I'm glad I choose this series.  A gripping story that you'll be thinking about long after you finish it.  Hope there is more to come.  Will keep an eye out for his future works.  Well done!

B002VPE1B6|5.0|My blu ray player stopped playing certain DVDs. So I wanted to replace some of my better DVDs with Blu ray without paying Blu ray price. This blu-ray works just fine. AND it came with a DVD, which is good because for some idiotic reason, the people who decided to make the special edition version of the DVD chose to put 2 versions of the 1st half of the movie on disc 1, then the 2 versions of the 2nd half of the movie on disc 2 (instead of putting one COMPLETE version of the movie on 1 disc, and the other COMPLETE version on the other). So every time I wanted to watch the movie, I had to get up and put in the 2nd dvd right in the middle of the movie. Can anyone say, &#34;DUMB IDEA??!!&#34; But now that this blu ray came with a DVD, I can watch it in the living room OR the bedroom without having to change in the middle of the movie. Completely satisfied!
0385535147|4.0|\\"For the land is filled with crimes of blood,<br />And the city is full of violence.<br />Therefore I will bring the worst of the Gentiles,<br />And they will possess their houses;<br />I will cause the pomp of the strong to cease,<br />And their holy places shall be defiled.\\" -- Ezekiel 7:23-24 (NKJV)<br /><br />One of the ways that freedom has been abridged is by wide-ranging laws that can cause anyone who had any dealings with a criminal to be drawn into a racketeering charge. That's just what happened to Malcolm Bannister, who handled the wrong real estate transactions ... helping to launder dirty money in the process. Guilt by association led to time in the penitentiary. Like all cons, he had a lot of time on his hands ... time that went into finding ways to get out. When a federal judge is murdered, the time is ripe for a \\"get of out jail free\\" card to anyone who could finger the murderer. With the FBI chasing its tail, Bannister has a plan.<br /><br />No one can manipulate the legal system better than a lawyer. John Grisham returns to his roots as a legal novelist in describing how laws can be broken with the help of the law.<br /><br />The story is an intriguing plot, the ultimate in the underdog trying to overcome lots of impossible limitations. Unfortunately, to make the story work the story bogs down in more details than even many third year law students would want to think about. I found my interest fading rapidly in the second half. But I had to take my hat off to anyone who would work so hard to come up with such an on-the-surface implausible story ... that just might lead to the results described here.<br /><br />While this won't be your favorite book in the Grisham library, I think you'll be glad you read it.

B008V4H6N6|5.0|Flying Lotus is really in a class/genre by itself. Often pushing the limits of what has been done musically ends up sounding sloppy, overdone, or extremely difficult to appreciate. What makes this album great in my mind is that it is so different from the vast majority of what is out there, yet is still easy to listen to and enjoyable throughout. The versatile use of synths/electronic beats and sounds keeps you interested while the intermittent interwoven melodies add an extra layer of enjoyment. Rarely to you find an album where each track flows together well yet each song creates an almost completely different feel. There is so much going on that it really does take a few listens to appreciate, but is not too difficult to enjoy on first listen.<br /><br />When comparing to the first album, I think this one ventures even more into the uncharted realm of electronica where the first record still had some semblance of a consistent back beat and some even radio-friendly tracks (dare I say). I couldn't find any tracks on this album that stood out separately as 'And the world laughs with you.....' and 'Do the Astral Plane' did on the first album. I think this one flows a little better because of it. Overall, though, it's difficult to really highlight major differences given the uniqueness of all Flying Lotus' music.<br /><br />I look forward to much more groundbreaking sound from this artist.

B009GYSQV6|4.0|My favorite thing about this album is actually the significant change from the last album. I find that with these great electronic/synth focused bands that it is difficult for them to come up with new material that is actually a different listening experience from the earlier stuff without sounding like variations or a continuation on a single theme. This album is definitely a bit softer and noticeably more minimal which makes it sound even darker/gloomier in my opinion. I don't like it quite as much as CCII comprehensively, but I appreciate the creativity and think it has its gems.<br /><br />I love Alice's vocals and they are more apparent on this record, yet I still wish they were mixed more clearly so you could consistently make out what she's saying on all the tracks instead of just a distorted added background layer. This album isn't for everyone. I can see how some of the distortions/synth loops can be almost annoying, but as a lover of most everything electronic, I always appreciate bands pushing the boundaries of what's been done and this album is most certainly that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and so glad that its available on the fire now. its so addicting. there are so many great ideas and recipes and dig projects
B008JFC6F0|5.0|What a Gem of a Record. This album melts together the greatest things happening in new music today with what has traditionally worked in the past; trippy synths, driving distorted guitars, engaging percussion, and interwoven lovely melodic lyrics. The combination of the above make for a beautiful and versatile album from start to finish without being too busy as is much of the electronic/synth focused music of today. This album is my introduction to the band and am definitely motivated to check out their other works. I'll refrain from commenting on specific songs as they all provide a different, but consistently pleasurable feel. This album has something for everyone and will be surprised if it doesn't end up considered for album of the year by the indie community - as it should. Ranks up there with Grizzly Bear's Shields and Beach House's Bloom for 2012. Can't wait for more from this band.

B009NOVCTM|4.0|Another decade has passed in the career of the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, and they're celebrating the 50th anniversary of their founding in 1962. Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Company are pushing 70, but the group has decided to go out with a bang. They're staging five arena shows on both sides of the Atlantic and putting out a new, feature-length, autobiographical documentary called \\"Crossfire Hurricane\\" with archival footage from the 60s and 70s narrated by the band. They've reconstructed and restored the first-ever Rolling Stones documentary, \\"Charlie Is My Darling,\\" filmed in Ireland in 1965, and published a 352-page \\"photographic biography\\" entitled \\"The Rolling Stones 50.\\" Finally, they're offering six (count 'em, six!) chronological greatest hits albums: a budget two-CD, a standard three-CD, a deluxe three-CD, a deluxe Blu-Ray, a deluxe vinyl five-LP, and a super deluxe five-CD/one-EP collection. Each set offers the same two new studio recordings -- good ones, dammit! If you have money to burn and don't mind making some of the richest men in the world just a bit richer, there's almost no limit to what you can spend on the Stones' music and memorabilia this year.<br /><br />The best-of compilations are expertly remastered, albeit selectively edited for length, so while newer listeners probably won't notice anything amiss, nostalgic fans might. The first two discs of the standard version (33 out of 50 tracks) cover the Stones' early career, revisiting most of the required hits from the 60s to the mid-70s. Starting with their very first single, a 1963 cover of Chuck Berry's \\"Come On,\\" the band includes music from their singles and studio albums up to \\"Black and Blue\\" in 1976. The third disc contains 17 recordings from the 1978 album \\"Some Girls\\" (though not the title track) to their final studio album in 2005, \\"A Bigger Bang,\\" plus the aforementioned new songs, \\"Doom and Gloom\\" and \\"One More Shot,\\" both of which harken back to the rough classic sound of the Stones. A 12-page booklet is enclosed.<br /><br />How does the three-CD set compare to \\"Forty Licks,\\" the two-disc, 40-track, 40th-anniversary collection? It's far better. Of the four new tunes on that non-chronological 2002 album, only \\"Don't Stop\\" is recycled; 33 of the 36 remaining cuts are included on \\"GRRR!\\" (absent are \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" and \\"You Got Me Rocking\\"). These 33 are supplemented with a couple of mid-60s covers, Buddy Holly's \\"Not Fade Away\\" and Howlin' Wolf's \\"Little Red Rooster,\\" and enough important songs from the Glimmer Twins to make a more satisfying package: \\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"As Tears Go By,\\" \\"Rocks Off,\\" \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"Respectable,\\" \\"Waiting on a Friend,\\" \\"Harlem Shuffle,\\" \\"Streets of Love,\\" and others. As wonderful as the music is, though, it's not perfect; several relatively weak choices (\\"We Love You,\\" \\"She Was Hot,\\" \\"Highwire\\") take the place of terrific songs like \\"Let It Bleed,\\" \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking,\\" and \\"Dead Flowers,\\" which are nowhere to be found.<br /><br />If you'd like this set with five postcards commemorating various tours and a 36-page hardcover book instead of the 12-page booklet, buy the Deluxe Edition; if you'd prefer it in a different format, both five-LP and imported Blu-Ray versions are available. And if money's no object, there's the huge Super Deluxe Edition: a 12-by-17-inch box containing four CDs with 80 hits and album cuts and covers, a five-track CD of the Stones' very first unreleased demos, a four-track vinyl EP of an unreleased BBC Radio session, a 96-page hardcover book with photos of various ephemera, a reproduction of an early poster from the Ricky Tick Club (an influential R&B venue on the outskirts of London), in addition to the 36-page book and the five postcards. The 89 super deluxe cuts encompass covers of the Beatles' \\"I Wanna Be Your Man,\\" O.V. Wright's \\"That's How Strong My Love Is,\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" as well as more hits and favorite performances not included on the three-disc set: \\"I'm Free,\\" \\"Play with Fire,\\" \\"Mother's Little Helper,\\" \\"Lady Jane,\\" \\"Honky Tonk Women,\\" \\"Midnight Rambler,\\" \\"You Got the Silver,\\" \\"Bitch,\\" \\"Dance Little Sister,\\" \\"Shattered,\\" \\"Far Away Eyes,\\" \\"She's So Cold,\\" \\"Rough Justice,\\" \\"Rain Fall Down,\\" etc.<br /><br />Compilations will never take the place of individual albums from the Rolling Stones' peak years, and they'll never please longtime fans like me who have no need for obvious radio fodder and want the rare stuff and the live stuff instead. There aren't a lot of surprises in these boxes, and the editing and inevitable omissions also reduce their value (where are \\"Live with Me\\" and \\"Star Star\\" and \\"Hang Fire\\" and a dozen more?), so I'm giving them only four stars. The two-CD set earns just three stars as it's even skimpier, dropping 10 songs from the three-CD set: \\"Time Is on My Side,\\" \\"Heart of Stone,\\" \\"Under My Thumb,\\" \\"We Love You,\\" \\"She's a Rainbow,\\" \\"Highwire,\\" \\"Doo Doo Doo Doo Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"She Was Hot,\\" \\"Streets of Love,\\" and \\"Rocks Off.\\" But if you're in the market for greatest hits, something to remind you of the Stones' awesome talent and staying power over the years, then these boxes are the best you're going to do for now -- though of course you could assemble your own list of fave mp3s and burn a set of CDs for yourself.<br /><br />Since Amazon has not listed the tracks of the super deluxe set, I will. I've indicated the 14 edited tracks.<br /><br />CD 1<br />1. Come On<br />2. I Wanna Be Your Man<br />3. Not Fade Away<br />4. That's How Strong My Love Is<br />5. It's All Over Now<br />6.

B0043UB0EI|5.0|No doubt! When you start with the first chapter you will not be able to stop until you see the season finale. A lot of blood, fight and drama with an exceptional performance from the actors. As soon you finishes with this season do not miss the prequel Spartacus Goods of the Arena and the Spartacus Vengeance! All deserve the each penny you pay for them.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Besides Mary Osmond, I seriously doubt that there is any other American songstress who is capable of being a better role model to impressionable teen girls--who already suffer from lots of hyperemotional issues like body image, putting out to men and eating disorders--than Christina Aguilera. I mean, sure, maybe...maybe Ke$ha is probably a better role model to teen girls than Osmond and Aguilera together, but you get the point, I hope. I hope that churches all across America put Lotus on their number one recommendation list for all teen girls to take home and listen to.<br /><br />Besides being a flawless role model for teen girls, Aguilera has always been an ultra-talented singer and songwriter, not anywhere near as good as Ke$ha, of course, or even William Hung (remember him?!) , but she still can kick it better than any other former Mouseketeer! That's fer sure, yo! On Lotus, she seamlessly blends the strengths of all her previous albums--the fresh-faced patriotism of her debut CD, the virginal cleanness of Dirty, and the musical genius of her latest CD--to make her greatest album ever.<br /><br />Take Red Hot Kinda Love, for one. First of all, it's totally original in that you never, ever expect a female pop singer to sing about romance, dating and love...ever! Kudos to Aguilera for being highly original and being a pioneer in the pop world. Yeah, b/it/ch/es! I just love how wholesome all her songs on this CD are; definitely a wise choice for parents who are too busy to raise their teen girls themselves. For instance, take Circles. This apparently \\"explicit\\" song is really an ode to wholesomeness and purity, as in not having sex before you're married, which is fine by me because it follows the Islamic tradition very faithfully. Another pure song is Your Body, which is misleading because it seems salacious, but in reality, it's really about girl scouts saving themselves for marriage, which, again, is a-okay with me because it fits into the Islamic tradition very congruently. Even the song Shut Up is very wholesome because it is actually an anthem that says \\"shut up!\\" to toxic influences like drugs, gangs, alcohol, sex before marriage, hand-holding, kissing and having \\"impure\\" thoughts.<br /><br />If you're a mom or a dad and are sick and tired of all the bad influences destroying your teen girl's values, please buy this CD for your little Jennifer. It will help her blossom into a respectable, young lady due to its sophistication, class and morals. I know that you may be hard-pressed for money in this devastated Obama economy of 8 percent unemployment and 16 percent underemployment, but still try. The future of your young Jennifer is at stake!congruently.

1616960922|5.0|I finished this book about an hour and a half after it showed up on my doorstep. It didn't take me very long to read. I loved every second of it.<br />As always, Brandon Sanderson is brilliant. Although we are confined with Shai in her quarters for the majority of the novel, Sanderson is still able to paint us a brilliant picture of how the world works. I absolutely loved the magic system in this novel too; for some reason the idea of being able to rewrite the history of an object really appeals to me.<br />I must admit, I was vaguely concerned that this book would not feel whole and finished, especially after reading Legion and feeling as if I only got half a story. This was not a problem for me with The Emperor's Soul. The story was whole; I didn't feel like I was missing anything. Sanderson left us at a good stopping point. And by the way, I loved the poetic symmetry of the ending. It was so right. It almost brought me to tears. Not that it was sad; it was just beautiful. Sanderson is a master of this genre, and he amply demonstrated that one more time just in case you were starting to doubt him. This book was amazing.<br />There was not a thing about this book I did't like. Sanderson, you have wowed me again.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have always wanted more of Suze ever since she literally exploded all over the pop world back in 2009 after appearing on England's version of American Idol. Her inexcusably plain-Jane looks and her Christ-like humility have stolen my heart, I must confess! I just adore how she keeps us wanting more and more of her by spacing out her various albums long enough to make our subservient hearts grow fonder of her. To wit, one album per year is the perfect wait time and not at all indicative of a cash-in mentality at all! Standing Ovation continues Suze's plump tradition of singing memorable songs that allow me to forget about all of the problems in my life while she serenades me with her sweet, sweet voice that clearly comes from the lips of an angel.<br /><br />Standing Ovation also continues Suze's incomparable talent for being perfectly original and very unique. I think the compilation album of old movie songs is a concept that has never, ever been done before, if I'm not mistaken. Ahhh, that's our Suze alright: plump amounts of perfect spacing between album releases and brilliant originality! I thank the Lord each night before I lay my head to sleep that that demi-god of musical awesomeness--Simon Cowell--had the c/a/j/o/n/es to \\"discover\\" her on Ireland's version of American Idol.<br /><br />The selection of old-timey movie songs is almost perfect, with my favorite being the cover of Michael Crawford's The Music of the Night. While this rendition is, admittedly, not as diva-like as the version with Antonio Banderas singing his little Latin heart out, it still got me off...off my bad mood, that is! Woohoo! When I was listening to Somewhere Over the Rainbow, I small tear trickled down either my left or right eye because I was instantly transported back to Kansas and Toto (the rad group, not the pooch) due to its schmaltzy sentimentality.<br /><br />I do hate to even mildly critique our Suze for we all know that she is virtually heaven-sent and, therefore, can do no wrong, but I feel that some far more classic movie songs should have been included here. I would literally...literally give my left you-know-what to hear our Suze's blessed vocal chords tackle these following movie songs that would have been right at home on this CD. This CD should have included Purely Sexual by Xavier from the highly regarded Showgirls movie, Black Snake Moan by that fine affirmative-action thespian Samuel L. Jackson, and, of course, the Crossed Legs instrumental score from the Basic Instinct soundtrack (perhaps our Suze could just hum that salacious tune, huh gals?!)<br /><br />In closing, I just want to say that I volunteer myself to give Suze her first kiss in life, if she'll have me.wrong, but I feel that some far more classic movie songs should have been included here.

B009YX02T8|5.0|Well thanks to Pandora I was able to sample the soundtrack for that last 5 day and I will say that I've enjoyed each track, some more than others, like \\"All I've Ever Needed\\", \\"Fire In The Water\\", \\"Everything And Nothing\\" and \\"Speak Up\\"... are some of my favorites....<br /><br />Everyone taste and expectation maybe high since this is the last soundtrack for the saga, but what I've notice is that once I hear the music in the movie, it seems to fit right where it belongs.  Also I am more a love of the Scores of Twilight than I am of the actually soundtrack, but either way I've always enjoyed them to the fullest!
B009NOVCTM|4.0|I have to admit: At first, I was a teensy bit skeptical about this compilation album by the Rolling Stones, even more skeptical than 99.9 percent of blacks are when considering voting for someone other than Obama. However, I'm glad I got GRRR! because I heard through the grapevine that it would contain two, brand-new songs! Wow! In this Obama economy where jobs are scarce, prices are higher thanks to inflation and personal net worth is down a lot, you have to take every deal that they throw at you, and the Rolling Stones have certainly made it worth my money to spend $23 on this sweet CD. You get not just a bunch of old Rolling Stones songs that you already have on your other Stones CDs, but you also get two, totally new songs from them! Yippee! Thanks, Keith, Mike, and the two other guys whose names momentarily escape me!<br /><br />Of course, all the awesome Stones hits that you already know and love and have at home on your other Stones CDs are featured here, winners such as Fool to Cry, My Girl, Indian Girl, Sex Drive, High Wire and, everyone's favorite, Sing This All Together (See What Happens).<br /><br />For me, though, I have to say that the reason I am so impressed with this CD is the fact that there is apparently some tie-in with the really real wrestlers of the WWE or something. I think this CD will be featured at next year's Wrestlemania, which I hope that Bastion Booger wins without any interference from Edge or Shane MacMahon.<br /><br />If you are wondering where to park your $23 that you just may have lying around somewhere, let me make it super-easy for you. Invest it in GRRR! I promise that you won't be making \\"grrr\\" sounds in anger after buying this album of old songs that are just part of a cobbled-together compilation.
B0001LJCMK|5.0|This is Very Good CD. It's Hip, it's now. It's Different.  It reminiscent of the early rock days of the Legendary Prince, the Stones,Punk,Funk, with an alternative rock edge. The sound is totally now! Ya know...its now. Sweet! I totally dig it man! Check it out.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|I've been searching for a new band in the alt-rock genre for quite some time now, and I do believe that Soundgarden fills this niche very easily. I had never, eeeever heard of Soundgarden prior to King Animal, probably because they are a brand-new band, but that's beside the point. After a few spins of King Animal, I must confess that I adore the band's chuga-chuga riffs, its very slow alt-rock sounds that reflect its middle age, and its guitar solos that make me mentally relive the finest moments I've ever spent on Guitar Hero. Surely, this awesome band will save music from the lame bands like Metallica, Tool and Queen.<br /><br />Ironically, Soundgarden is from Puget Sound, which is where the grunge explosion happened some 20 years ago. I guess Kris Cornell and company are a bunch of Johnnys-come-lately, huh? Anywho, I do commend Cornell for trying really hard to sound like a really good alt-rock singer, but he's no match to the lead singer of the Kings of Leon, whose voice just explodes with captivating urgency and hits all the high notes properly. Still, Cornell is a bit old to try to be an alt-rock singer (about 50), which makes me wonder what career he had before entering music at this old age. Anyway, I think the bass player is pretty decent, but he can sure take lessons from the bass players of the backing bands of the Jonas Bros. and Miley Cyrus because something about his bass just sounds off. Instead of going thubba-thubba-thubba, Soundgarden's bassist plays the bass incorrectly by making it go dumb-dumb-dumb!!<br /><br />Still, I found a few good songs on this CD, which means that I will be taking it with me to my next AA meeting. Been Away Too Long is your classic, hardcore alt-rock-emo offering that could have been and should have been on the last CD of Bullet For My Valentine. I still can't get its woo-woo choruses and its one-chord progressions out of my head; it is that catchy. Other winners include Taree and Blood on the Valley Floor, both of which tackle the pressing, topical issues of Democrat women who are having their birth control taken away by no-sex-before-marriage Republicans. All in all, I'd say these songs are a good effort by a first-time band!<br /><br />I hope that Soundgarden keeps plugging away at it and puts out more and more CDs in the future. They do sound promising because they picked the right genre, alt-rock-emo, in which to make their debut. However, I hope that they'll continue to improve their sound by adding some autotune in the future, along with some Glee cast members singing backup vocals.tackle the pressing, topical issues of Democrat women who are having their birth control taken away by no-sex-before-marriage Republicans.

B009J2VR3Y|5.0|\\"I Will Always Love You: The Best of Whitney Houston\\" is an excellent example of a single greatest hits record of an artist celebrating the singer's original voice and her presence in the music scene. Although not as near as extensive as her 2000's \\"Greatest Hits\\", this CD is sure to please the most ardent Whitney fan and those that have only discovered her music in the last year following her untimely death.<br /><br /> The tracks have all been remastered and what is also amazing is that the album contains all of her #1 hits along with two songs never released before: the R and B flavoured \\"Never Get Up\\", probably shelved from her \\"Just Whitney\\" album from 2001 and her original vocals of \\"I Look To You\\" from 1998's \\"My Love Is Your Love\\" CD. The latter is a beautiful duet with R. Kelly who wrote the song for Whitney and sang a stirring rendition at her funeral. In this outing R. Kelly's vocals were recorded in 2012 and were added to the original track.<br /><br /> Similarily Dolly Parton, who penned Whitney's signature song \\"I Will Always Love You\\", had a greatest hits album out 16 years ago titled \\"I Will Always Love You and other Greatest Hits\\" for Columbia.<br /><br /> This CD definitely serves as a fine remembrance of one of the greatest voices to ever live and it is through this record that Whitney Houston will always live in.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|For the price this is just a fantastic watch. Extremely smooth motion, solid construction, simple but sophisticated style, automatic movement (ie. no batteries, powered by your movement). The strap could be a bit better but you can easily replace it with a leather or NATO style strap. Don't hesitate to buy it.
B005ES0Z9O|5.0|I am an RN and spend 12 hour a night for 5 nights in a row on my feet. These shoes are great. No aching feet in the am. And everyone has commented positively about the 2 tone and deep tread. My last pair just wore out after 3 years of constant wear. Love them!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The 3D in the movie is excellent. Plus you get the digital copy, regular Bluray, DVD and a bunch of extras like Marvel comics for the iPad and a music CD.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B00A65GMM4|1.0|This series is fantastic but Amazon HD is seriously flawed and does not function properly.  I could rip the version for free and have a better viewing experience.  Please Amazon make the HD consistently function or do not charge extra for it!
B000SEGEKI|5.0|If you're a programmer (any language or technology) and you care about your craft, you should read this book.<br /><br />In fact, it should be a must-read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game has great graphics and is one of the most challenging match 3 games I've played.  It starts off fairly easy but then quickly becomes more difficult with a lot of strategy involved. Highly recommend!
B00846REIS|5.0|I have never been someone who reads books and I finished book 1 & 2 in three days lol. It doesn't drag on at all and while there were many similarities to the 50 Shades series it did not distract from the story.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Its one of those movies you watched over and over again as a child. When I learned my wife hadnt seen it i had to rent it first thing. Amazon viewer works pretty good. We had an issue but was eventually able to get it to run. She liked it... I still love it... lol
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is hard to put down! myself and my 2  daughters love this game  it is really addictive and lots of fun for any age
B009FZFONO|5.0|Awesome show, and even better that I can watch it here without having to pay for outrageous cable bills or wait for it to come out on DVD.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|The title for this novel was interesting to me.  It almost sounded like a reference book for a florist.<br />The story draws the reader in with the main character as a child with no home, but a love for flowers.  As a foster child she had many places she was shifted to one by one.<br />The flowers were a constant in her life.  Through sorrow and joy, lonliness and love and it affected every place she went and with every person she established a relationship with.<br />This book will give you a work out for your emotions.  Sad and yet joyful, tragic but yet trimphant.  It is delightful.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This volume showed continued interest and references to WW2 but in some cases became too wordy and dragged to get to whatever point was being made.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I like the story in these books both books in the series are really good. Very interesting characters keeps your interest from beginning to end.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books, and I bought this book knowing that it was for a more mature audience. It is definitely darker. You can still see J.K.'s writing style throughout the book with the same depth of character, but this took me a while to get into. Once I forced myself to sit down and read it I got caught up in the characters and the story. I finished it not really knowing if I liked it or not and kind of depressed. I'm glad I read it, but I will never re-read this one like I do with Harry Potter.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Un libro excelente, lo recomiendo. La película es una de las pocas que le hace algo de justicia al libro. Al leer este y el segundo entiendes aún mucho mejor la historia.
B0098VXN2Y|1.0|Okay movie, but just \\"okay\\" at best. What a waste of Chris Rock. Could have been done a lot better. Would not recommend unless there is nothing else on worth watching.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|This was a horror movie from my early years that seemed terrifying at the time.it was a must for my collection.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really like the game play - both the hidden items and the quests. like others I wish the game was really free or at least let you do more without paying for crystals and energy.
B002ZG9968|3.0|This movie, The Back-up Plan's story could have been told with much less foul language. For me it distracted from the story totally. Do people really talk like that?
B003ZWN7KU|3.0|Once again...  I wish I could do 3-1/2 stars.  While not as good as George Romero's classics & also not as good as his last outing (Diary Of The Dead, which I liked...)  I thought most of the reviews of this movie were unfair.  Acting is pretty good.  Even some of the action.  And it plays as a direct spin-off from Diary Of The Dead, which I always like.  Continuity & tying things together is always fun.  If you don't like it at first, stick with it.  It gets better.
B008OOYALE|5.0|it has cute dragons keeps the kid's happy when it rains you get to breed new dragon's it is a lot of fun and pretty copses thank you
B009HV2JT8|5.0|The movie gave an exciting twist to the story of Abraham Lincoln. The move was suspensful and filled with drama.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I liked the first two books a lot. I think they were great reads, but this third book leave something to be desired.<br /><br />The first issue is that time just jumps constantly, there's little detail in a lot of things and the book will simply tell you that Katniss did such and such for a few weeks and then something happened. In the first two books almost every single day is detailed. You feel as if you can almost tell people hour by hour what happens. Third book time just jumps there little to no story given for these jumps just forced time progression.<br /><br />The largest issues over all is this. The second book on my Kindle is 391 pages with great format and spacing. The third book is 390 pages, but here's the thing. Every sentence is double spaced. The book by content is half that of the second one. It's a trick high school students use to meet page counts. If you can just look at the samples I'm sure they can show what I mean.<br /><br />Third book is decent but I feel like I'm missing half the book.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|This product adapt the mac style, and it quality is good.  it can be adornment with macbook on the desk
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I read the back of this book and wasn't so sure I was going to like it because Sophie Kinsella + ghosts is not something I'm used to, but hey, it surprised me! Apparently ghosts and chick lit go fine together... Anyway, I did enjoy this book and finish it within a day, though it started a little slow and the Aunt Sadie character got on my nerves on more than a few occasions.  Also, Lara is a lot like Rebecca Bloomwood in the ditzy, \\"nooo, what are you DOing\\" sense, which is generally a type of girl I want to shake and wake up from her la-la land, but Kinsella once again writes her to be pretty darned likable despite her many flaws.<br /><br />Fun, light, heartwarming, silly.  In the end, somehow exactly what you'd expect from a Sophie Kinsella book, despite the whole ghost thing.
0525953728|5.0|Finally, someone has written a book without a political component.  The author was there, and called it the way he saw it and participated in it. I commend this author and his entire team for a job well done.  There are no apologies, no fudging, and it is apparent that the team went in with a forgone conclusion that UBL was not going to emerge alive if anyone got a shot at him.  He died the way he should have and, other than the radical muslims, there have been no protests from reasonable people that I have seen as to the way this situation was approached and completed. Kudos to the Seals and other Special Forces that were on this mission.  They went in not knowing if they were going to stay alive and protected themselves appropriately. The politicians in the situation room photo op were no doubt concerned about their own careers rather than the real heroes on the ground. It was easy to pay them no attention in this whole operation.  I doubt that there was a soul in that room thousands of miles from the action that would have the guts to go in there themselves, even with training.  Read this fascinating book for the real story and forget the spinning done by the politicians.
B000GWE44U|5.0|One of Stephen King's best.  Shelly Duval was better suited to Olive Oyl than to this part, and there's a major change to the ending from the book, but the movie never fails to thrill.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The story was not just interesting, the characters were drawn with depth and sensitivity, making the book almost impossible to put down!
B0012DP8A6|5.0|I first saw this play at the Westwood Playhouse in West Los Angeles and loved it.  The movie is even better, if possible.  The music is fantastic and the dark humor mitigated at the end of the movie as it was not in the play.
1451638450|5.0|After waiting for so long for a new Vorkosigan Saga book, I read this one in one day! Oops, should have savored it.<br /><br />As a fan of everything LMB has written, I give it five stars. For new readers, maybe start with something else, because this is not her best. On the other hand, if you love romance novels and aren't as interested science fiction, this and 'A Civil Campaign' are perfect for you. It has a somewhat familiar romance novel plot - and it has all the pleasures of my favorite romance novels (especially my all time favorite, Georgette Heyer)- without the annoying aspects of far too many of them (why is every damsel pursued homicidal crazies, or forced into sham marriages for protection? Oh, wait, this book has those too. But it does avoid excruciatingly detailed and repetitive love scenes and irrational plot twists.) I missed Miles, but it was a pleasure to see Ivan's strengths no longer overshadowed.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|In my opinion, Tim Curry is one of the most underrated comic actors on the screen.  He's at his best as Dr. Frankenfurter and the all-star cast is all great.  The music is fantastic and the popularity of this movie has lasted across generations.
030758836X|5.0|I've never left a review before even though Amazon emails me about everything I purchase.  This book deserves an amazing review so here I am!!  I could not put it down!!  I am an avid reader and this is in my top ten!  It twists and turns and then twists again!!  I will not say anymore because I hate giving plots away.  Buy it!  Read it!  Male and females must read!!  My only questions are, where is book two and where is the movie deal!!

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased it for what it should do and it does the job.  That's why I purchased it.  I lost my other one.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I never thought that I would read 50 shades of Grey. But curiousity got the better of me, and here I am writing a review after reading all three books. This series is not for someone who is not into romance/erotic fiction. It is not for the discerning literary connoisseur or for someone wanting to read a book that will transport them to a different plane intellectually or imaginatively. This is a simple read, and it should be taken that way.<br /><br />What I disliked about the books: The writing, plot, and lack of depth. When reading the first book, I was especially annoyed with the language, the way she kept repeating herself over and over, the way she constantly brought attention to mundane details like a car and how much it cost. Yes, you character is wealthy beyond imagination. We get that! There were points in the book that I thought I couldn't read any more of this. But after reading the whole series it occured to me that the author did make an attempt to redeem her writing or she got a better editor.<br /><br />What I liked about the books: in two words: Christian Grey. I loved his character and his story. I found Anastasia Steele dull in comparison. This character and their relationship is what kept me with the series.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to others: Yes, I would. But with the disclaimer: don't go in with pre-conceived opinions. You might be surprised when you like the book.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This was an easy read and while it had some humor, it wasn't laugh out loud funny.<br />BONUS -- World history lesson included.
0446580848|5.0|What can you say, Its Nelson DeMille at his best. The only problem with Nelson's books is you go to work a little groggy from lack of sleep. I can't put it down before 2AM
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book. It was better than the movie. It made me buy the Catching Fire book. Thank you.
B00A17AD36|5.0|I downloaded the 3 free mixtapes months ago and have been obsessed since. I bought this album to support him, and the three extra tracks were just extras. I hope his first REAL album shows growth as an album, as this is basically a reissue. There are standouts, but you can have all the songs for $8.99, so just buy the whole thing. Honestly Channel Orange by Frank Ocean, this album, and good kid m.A.A.d. city by Kendrick Lamar are all albums by (relatively) new artists that will contend for album of the year. GKMC will win best Rap album, this or Channel Orange will win best R&B, and Taylor Swift will win all the rest. But deff buy this it is a life changer, which will surely change up the music scene. The Weeknd sort of sounds like canadian Michael Jackson who mostly sings about drugs and having meaning-less sex, in a tragic sounding way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have only read a few pages, but I love it already. It seems to be a more appealing story as war is occurring all over Panem. Can't wait to finish it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great!!! This is better than a real calculator. Its actually accurate, unlike my old calculator app.  Hint: do not buy a Walmart made calculator.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I love most anything Barbra sings.  This included songs that I have never heard her sing before and she was wonderful, as usual!!!
B0049DRH28|5.0|I enjoyed Steamboy very much. Great plot and action. Animation was very, very detailed. Loved every second of this film.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Even though his voice is aging, he is still as smooth as ever.  No one phrases a song like Tony!!!
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Deftones have done it again.<br /><br />It's unheard of for a band to still be making such creative strides and hitting such highs this late in their career, but they've never been the type to go with the flow. If Diamond Eyes was a re-invigoration, Koi No Yokan is the victory lap.<br /><br />And it's a lush, colorful one too. As always, we find Deftones expanding on their sound and pushing their sonic boundaries with songs like 'Rosemary' (a beautiful 7 minute song that blends post-rock sounds with heavy 8 string riffing), or songs like 'Poltergeist' and 'Entombed' which ebb and flow between calm, floaty verses and soaring choruses. And Chino's vocals are in top form - he's laid off on his trademark howl more than usual, but his singing is, dare I say, all the better for it, and the songs are much stronger melodically.<br /><br />In fact, the entire album has a strong melodic core - most Deftones albums always take a bit of time to grow on me, but there isn't one song on this album that didn't immediately grab me with some hook, riff, or synth line. And more than that, it's an album full of dynamics, too. The songs push and pull between heavy and soft, atmospheric and aggressive, but without ever clashing with the whole.<br /><br />Koi No Yokan manages to solidify years of experimentation and growth into an 11 track journey, and sets up their future in a way that promises even more great music after it. What we have here, is a band that is incapable of disappointing.
1469984202|5.0|This is the first time I've felt compelled to write an Amazon review. I just finished the book roughly 10 minutes ago and had to give it my two cent endorsement. Wool has a great story and compelling characters, you will not be disappointed. To top it all off the digital book is a bargain.<br /><br />Mr. Howey, I'm not sure if you'll read this or not, but thank you for the great book. I'll be sure to check out your other works as well. AFTER i read First Shift, Legacy of course (downloaded last night). That reminds me, I need to go...
B000784WMW|5.0|This is the best interpretation of Charlotte Bronte novel I have ever seen. Timothy Dalton is the best Mr. Rochester.<br />If you love romantic movies - this Jane Eyre is a real diamond.
B009MO5ES8|4.0|Saw this movie back in theaters. As a biker, I thought it had great insight into bike culture. While carrying a slightly predictable plot, the movie was still was very entertaining, witty and funny. Oh yeah, and there is a twist at the end! Decent acting all around.<br /><br />All in all, I don't buy very many movies but this one I will definitely watch again!
B0086700CM|4.0|love this game.  it's very addicting so beware.  I just can't figure out how to use my wallpaper that is one of the objectives.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If ever you thought you may have slightly enjoyed listening to Susan Boyle before, then you must NOT miss this new album! Even familiar old 'warhorses' can sound new again when la Boyle applies her own special kind of vocal magic to them. With every single song on Standing Ovation, she has not only surpassed her three previous album efforts, and managed to produce an entire album of the kind of songs/style of singing she was absolutely born to do, but she has also given to the world a true gift: the type of album so many of us have longed for from her ever since discovering this incredible songstress via a BGT audition video from back in April 2009 which went viral on YouTube.<br /><br />It's impossible for me to select a real favorite, or least-favorite song here--all eleven of the selections are top-notch in both quality and musical interest. No 'boring filler material' in ear-shot! Susan uses her voice on each song like a rare, finely-tuned instrument: now quiet and almost sadly 'spoken', now bold and full-voiced but never 'mannered' or overdone at all. Just--interesting, varied, tasteful, with no histrionics necessary. The three duets all sound remarkable, maybe a little 'different' than what we've heard others do with them before, and as for the other eight songs, no matter how many times one has heard others perform them, you'll come away from a good listening thinking \\"this is just a bit different and I LIKE it!\\"<br /><br />For me, the least familiar of the songs was 'Out Here On My Own', that the wonderful Irene Cara sang in the movie version of Fame. I liked it then--hearing what Susan has chosen to do with it is turning it into a sort of 'almost-favorite' for the moment. And I'll mention the Les Miz classic 'Bring Him Home', as it's a 'male' song seldom recorded by a female singer--but Susan makes it work, and the result is both spine-tingling and stunning.<br /><br />In short, these are 'songs written for the musical theater' (and in a couple of cases, for movies) which should appeal even to folks who generally think they do not care for that genre at all. Give it a try--and please trust me when I say that none of the album's sound clips I listened to before hearing the songs in total prepared me at all for what I was about to discover--a real gem of a listening masterpiece, complete with plenty of built-in goosebumps and chills galore.
