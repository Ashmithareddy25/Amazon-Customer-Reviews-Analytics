B005HSG3VK|4.0|I like this lightweight microshell folio case cover. It's protection for my kindle when I may drop it. I don't like the way you fold it to make a stand because it's wont stay in it's place, This is the reason I gave it a four star instead of a five star
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|i watched it several times and all of the times it stalled then fast fowarded (missing minutes of the movie and having to rewind to see it)<br />not a good experience.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|This movie is great for children and adults, alike.  With a great message and even better acting, you don't want to pass up on a movie like this.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I had my doubts but more than pleasantly surprised.  Am I able to give it 6 stars? Sound is amazing.  Band is energetic and totally into it.  It is like a breath of fresh air to a catalog that hasn't been added to in many years. A must have for the Zep fan.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|love the twist the Lincoln's presidency but still keeping to historical facts! Everybody must see this movie! A+ A+ A+
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I was disappointed in the last few Cornwell novels, including The Bone Bed. Kaye Scarpetta's monotone makes the reader wonder why she should care about her. The Bone Bed 's plot is too contrived. I know Patricial Cornwell is capable of better, so what is she doing?
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I dont read many books but this one I couldn't put down.  It gives a lot of detail and you just want to know whats next...<br />This is easy book to read.  I liked it very much and would buy the 2nd and 3rd book after reading the 1st one.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|I always enjoy reading Harry Bosch plots. Michael Connelly knows how to spin an intriguing tale about human foibles. Harry is an honest, flawed character.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I started reading this series as a 50 Shades hangover cure. I ended up really enjoying it. Can't wait for the 3rd book to release in May '13!
B007THA4FI|2.0|JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels were wonderful reads! Unfortunately,  her adult novel, The Casual Vacancy, has a plot encumbered by too many descriptive details (which worked in Harry Potter novels) and moved at a glacial pace.  As she SLOWLY meanders through the story, it is difficult to care about each character and instead wish the end would come soon.
1401937519|5.0|I found this book to be really amazing! The message is comforting and beautiful, its almost a description of something deep down that seems familiar or like a blurred memory lost in the journey. It feels like Anita was part of the very few that was shown a rose,grabbed it and then came back to show it to the world.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I read all of the reviews and the number of negative reviews put me off from buying this DVD. However, my friends all seemed to enjoy the movie so I reversed my position and bought the DVD. I was pleased that I made this purchase as the movie was quite enjoyable and was a great escape from the daily grind of reality.  If you want to escape and enjoy a movie, this one works terrific.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I watched this with my 11, 8 and 7 year olds. We all just loved it. A bit spooky for the younger ones, but my kids didn't seem too spooked by it. We all really enjoyed it! It's one of the few movies that we could agree was worth the purchase after renting it here. We'll be watching it quite a bit in the future!
B001AQO3QA|3.0|It was worth the price, and the extra footage was nice, but the latter movies were bad and the make-of's for them just made me hate them more.<br /><br />They showed less of the deleted scenes from the first film in the deleted-scenes section than other parts of the making-of videos.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This movie was not very impressive. I honestly felt I was going to watch a jaw dropping movie but the cheezy green screen shots and the boring storyline really took it down several notches. I really have to say with all the amazing modern film making out there I believed the hype that this was going to be epic and exceed the previous films by leeps and bounds. It didnt its just another bad horor film that wasted my time. The storyline is pathetuc trying to intertwine all his movies previously falls short not to mention the typical to be continued cheeze ball ending. Seriously this guy is stuck in 1992 and needs to talk to the real filmakers of tomorrow. Im glad they dropped the price because it was not worth half of what I paid.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|at first it was for my daughter then it got me hooked. I had to get her off my fone . so now we got it on my kindle.I totally recommend it.

B00A77II0U|4.0|the game was too short. I would've liked to play a little longer. it was a lot of fun the puzzles were challenging but not too hard to be unsolvable.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Loved the album! Just wondering when &#34;Wish upon a Star&#34; became a Christmas song? Although, upon reflection, it is appropriate.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was well written and showed me not only what my love language is but also what my husband's is. Highly recommend this book to anyone who is in a relationship.
1451695195|5.0|Eben Alexander, M.D.: pristine medical and scientific credentials; experience in the top Boston hospitals, a sought-after neurosurgeon.  Suddenly he contracts E-coli bacterial meningitis and is comatose.  The disease is eating his brain and the prognosis is grim.  Eben is dying.<br /><br />Well, not quite.  Eben is very ill but his spirit is conscious and it has passed through a dull, flat space which offers a worm's eye view of experience (limbo cum purgatory?) and into the light, where he tastes the heavenly afterlife--not a place in the clouds but an all-encompassing spiritual plane in which understanding occurs instantaneously, love is omnipresent, there are guardian angels, figures floating in orbs, the Creator Himself and (thank you, Lord), dogs.<br /><br />The author examines all of the alternative, physiological explanations for his experience and realizes that they are all inadequate.  The scientist/sceptic by training becomes an intense believer.  The empiricist sees the experience for what it must be (assuming that there is no chemical delusion occurring here): the first stage of scientific proof.<br /><br />The author's heaven is so overwhelming that descriptions are, perforce, vague and inadequate.  The experience is not exactly ineffable or inexpressible, but it is so vast and so heightened that describing it is a struggle.  Fortunately, he writes well and we have a reasonably clear sense of the experience that he is laboring to describe.<br /><br />What is particularly interesting is the fact that his experience corresponds, in many ways, to what we have hoped to believe.  There are people there; there are angels there and there is contact with God there.  There are fields and skies, not so much an enclosed realistic, Edenic garden, but more like a beautifully-colored Rainbow-britelike space, a heightened, purified earthly landscape.<br /><br />Eben Alexander's heaven is one which particularly focuses on consciousness and understanding, spiritual learning at an unanticipated, nearly unimaginable level, a kind of infused knowledge.  Do we each have the kind of heaven that we would desire or is this the universal article?  The orbs suggest something out of Leibniz's Monadology and the author learns the reason for evil in the world: so that we might have authentic free will.  That's what Milton said, so perhaps he was right.<br /><br />Like the proofs for God's existence, near death experiences are more aids to piety than apodictic proofs, compelling belief.  Given the stakes, however, they certainly compel our attention and the author here is the perfect intermediary--the last person who would believe what he actually experienced, now with the faith of a convert.<br /><br />This is a lovely little book that all should read--believers, sceptics, searchers.  At the very least, the stakes involved put all of our daily travails in context and may serve to ameliorate them.<br /><br />Someone once said that it's not going to be heaven if there's no Ray Charles and others have said that hell is a place without Mozart.  There are sounds there as well, but mostly unconditional love and learning, people, angels, God . . . and dogs.ning at an unanticipated, nearly unimaginable level, a kind of infused knowledge.

B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Most of the album was very enjoyable.  I have only listened to it a couple times, but liked almost all of what I heard.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Great product. Easy accessibility on the site and was able to watch on my tv. I enjoyed this season greatly.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|easy to use and works great. Challenging at many levels with plenty of options to keep it interesting. nice addition to the Kindle.
1449410243|5.0|If you like to laugh then get this book, but be warned it is for the more mature type of people.
0345803485|1.0|When you learn that this started as Twilight fan fiction you will know what kind of awful writing to expect. DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE this is crap. The author obviously has no experience in the world of BDSM. Her characters are flat , poorly conceived and she turns what is a very intimate and intense relationship into an abusive sob who brutalises a vapid girl.<br />THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU WANT  TO READ IF YOU WANT A LOOK INTO KINK.. If you want a better view I'd suggest throwing this trash away and look for The Marketplace Series written by Laura Antoniou<br /><br />A woman who live the life style and understands it intimately and understands the dynamic between people who live this lifestyle. Yes Laura's books are a bit more intense than most real life experiences, bu she sure knows what she is writing about. Laura gives you characters you care about..James, in the Stephie Meyers tradition, gives you empty molds any plant can fit into
B007PFDJH4|5.0|This novel blew me away-- it was absolutely stunning. Yes, I agree with some reviewers that it is hard to get into, BUT it is well worth the perserverance. In the end, when it all comes together, a most satisfying read, indeed. Superb title.
B0081L37Z0|3.0|It was a good movie to pass the time.  There were some funny parts in the movie but it wasn't anything memorable.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|No negative stars here....pity. There is simply nothing good to say about this book. Even word :&#34;book&#34; is an overstatement. 2nd class elementary school homework, quiet long one, and terribly stupid. My favorite moment: two medieval squires talk, and one of them says to the another: &#34;... You are on radar...&#34;. Keep off!
B0086DBE62|4.0|Scenery was very well done,  clothing was appropiate for the story, acting was well done led by Julia Roberts.  Outcome was a twist but in good taste.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I did not like this as much as Sigh No More.  Babel seems a bit more mainstream.  Still, it is good listening.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is a perfect beach lazy day book.  I enjoyed its novelty and ease of characters. Kept me fully entertained and like winning the lottery...dreaming of my very own pot of gold.
B0087240Z4|5.0|I did not like some parts of this album when I first got it - such as the title track - but, the more I listen to it, the more it grew on me.  Now I love the whole thing.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have watched all but the last movie until now.  Loved it!  Shouldn't miss if you watched any of the rest of the series!
B005NNV4TU|5.0|One of my favorite Pink Floyd albums.  There is not a single song on it that I don't love.  A must have.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I just loved this whole series.  You can't miss this one!  You won't be dissappointed!  Enjoy them all and make sure you get part 1 and 2 of the Deathly Hallows.
B0095XPZBC|2.0|I was so looking forward to getting Season 2 of Star Trek:TNG on Blu-ray. Season 1 looked amazing. Such care and love went into that set and now all I can say is what happened?! Season 2 looks terrible! It's really sad and frustrating that this was actually approved of by CBS. The space shots are now totally inconsistent from the Season 1 space shots. Planets look blurry, the Enterprise looks unrealistic in certain scenes compared to the previous release. Even some of the interior shots with the actors look grainy.<br /><br />The only postives are the extras like the extended cut of The Measure of a Man with commentary, gag reel and new docs along with the old docs from the DVDs. Still, it's ridiculous at the quality drop for the actually episodes.

Aloha!!!!
B009CG2YDE|4.0|What a fun game! Its difficulty makes it an enjoyable play. I didn't realize till I had completed all the levels that you can hold down on the screen to charge up your weapon. Anyway, good old school gameplay and fun graphics make this one pretty cool.

1401223176|5.0|Hush is such a great villain in my perspective and he just provides a certain side to the Batman universe that is needed. Since it was his first appearance it showed people a new villain that can make Batman actually afraid of what he does.

0525953728|5.0|Liked the fact that this was a simple telling from one man's perspective of his version of the story he was a part of.  No glitz or glamor, just a great story of an important event.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I never read any of her books and was a little concerned when our book club chose this book for the month.  I was concerned that I wouldn't be able to finish --it is  long, but once I started reading , it didn't take me long to finish.  There were parts that were a little boring, but they were few and you read through them to find something on the other end very interesting.  I enjoyed it very much, although, not fond of the ending, but realized after a couple of days, that is the way it had to end.
B0076DELIG|3.0|It is good to have Harry Bosch back...with all his semi-functioning personal relations, his love of jazz, etc...<br /><br />BUT unfortunately the story is not as sophisticated as Michael Connelly's earlier work :/
B006TLFPKO|5.0|I have loved all of the Twilight movies, and this one was no exception.  I missed this one when it was at the movies, so I wanted to be sure and see it before Part II!

B009E3EY38|5.0|Makes an excellent gift for any LED ZEPPELIN fan.Great for entertaining guests,or,just listen to the audio CDs for personal enjoyment.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Not as good as the 1st version but what the hell - this one has Chuck Norris in it. If Chuck had only appeared in two scenes, this would be a GREAT movie by itself ..........wait a minute.... Chuck WAS only in two scenes. Dangnabbit ...... I got robbed!!!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|gREAT RECORDINGS. GREAT MATERIAL OF A REAL TIGHT BLUES ENSEMBLE.<br />Real good concert to see. Recording brings it all back
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Grew up surrounded by Marvel comics.... every Marvel movie is a little bit of childhood brought forward. Wish there was a little more depth to the storyline but it will do. Shockingly un-anticipated end to the story though. Must mean there is a Batman and Robin coming soon!!!!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I had the battery app on kindle fire and when I got my kindle fire if I got it on it as well. I like seeing where my charge is and being told when it gets to low.  I haven't experienced any problems with the app at all.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I am an avid reader and have read some books that were difficult to get through. Nevertheless, I did so and with little effort. I give the book a chance till the very end. The Life of Pi was the hardest book that I have ever forced myself to read. Absolute mind numbing torture.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Very good read, looking forward to the next one! Hope it's as gripping as the first and the second one!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this game is awsome. amazing graphics and addictive gameplay!  first time I played I was hooked! cant put it down! try this thing. you wont regret it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and addicting this game Is great for the whole family and will be enjoyed by all ages even by grandma
B007SSEBCU|2.0|I am disappointed at the &#34;perspective&#34; the movie was made from.  The film missed the chance to due justice to one of our times bravest ladies and instead<br />Diminished her by looking at her life from her most vulnerable time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read this whole series in like three days, these books are so good!  Plus buying them all on my Kindle saved me a ton of money as opposed to paying about $40 for them in a store.
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny?  A perfect combination, with cameos by Bill Murray, Larry Bird and several 90s NBA stars, as well as Yosemite Sam, Road Runner, and the whole Loonie Tunes cast.  Really well written and edited, fun for the whole family!
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Great CD and my current fav!<br />Something for everyone on this one. Fantastic lyrics and great music too.  Buy this one

B007HACDLK|5.0|Just when you you think that Vince Flynn cannot do another great book with his major character.  He fools you.  This is, hopefully, not the last (Flynn has been fighting cancer).  The Last Man is fast paced and the ending is brilliant.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I could not put this book down. I felt as if I were right there amongst the characters. I will not see the movie. The images brought up while reading this story are so much better.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I honestly don't know why this movie is so popular. The story was weak (lets stick batman in jail so he can break out in a spectacular way?) and the villain was ho-hum (we didn't get to destroy gotham in the first movie, so lets try again- but harder this time.) Where did Bane even come from anyway? Why does he have it in for batman? Nothing was explained.<br /><br />This movie had nothing of the intrigue and plot twists of Dark Knight which made that movie so amazing. Obviously it's hard to follow Heath, but they should have spent more time dealing with batman's struggle and physiological growth. Or at least some depth, rather then large scenes of football stadiums blowing up.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but the first two movies blow this one away. Pass.
B0049WHNLO|5.0|rhese song on  this are some great jazz music if you real want to remember some songs by one of  greatest performer
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I wanted to read this before watching the movie. It was definitely written for the younger mindset. Disturbing in that the premise involves children murdering each other as sport but overall an ok read.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I bought this for a co worker and myself.  I have always liked Garth Brooks and this cd came with<br />many top songs from his career.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This movie focusses on an aspect of Lincoln's career that doesn't usually get much attention. Lincoln is known for his oratory, his pithy quotes, his leadership in the Civil War and his progressive views on slavery and the role of government in society. There's a tendency to overlook the practical matter of getting political decisions supported in the House. This movie redresses that missing element.<br /><br />The film is surprisingly intimate, given the dramatic circumstances of the time in which it is set. It begins at the start of 1865 with the Civil War going badly for the South, but no immediate prospect of peace. Lincoln sees this as an opportunity to force through an amendment to the Constitution making slavery illegal. Most of the film deals with the political machinations, including not a little chicanery, needed to obtain the necessary 2/3rds majority required to pass a Constitutional amendment. We see Lincoln as master manipulator, knowing where and how to apply pressure to get what he wants. He must satisfy not only his own Republican party, but also a sufficient number of Democrats to back the motion and the back-room deals and the dichotomy between what is said in private and what is put out for public consumption is fascinating (and still very much a part of politics today). Incidentally, those not familiar with the period may be surprised to learn that in 1865 the Republicans were the party in favor of expanding the role of government and protecting human rights.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderfully impressive performance as Lincoln. Although he maintains his calm and rarely raises his voice, he is a magnetic presence whenever he is onscreen and it is easy to believe that he is able to bend people to his will. My wife, an Illinois native, assures me that his accent is authentic to the Kentucky/Illinois region of the midwest and he looks very much as Lincoln is usually portrayed. The manner in which Day-Lewis is able to slip from genial homeliness to ruthless political leadership to concerned husband and worried father is amazing; acting of the highest quality which will surely receive an Oscar nomination. He is well-supported by a team of veteran actors, among whom Tommy Lee Jones, as the leader of the progressive faction in the Republican party, stands out. I find the sub-plot involving Mary Lincoln's reluctance to let their son go to war is a distraction rather than an essential part of the film, but it does allow the actors to show their range and it incorporates a human element into Lincoln's character to sit alongside his more driven political persona.<br /><br />The movie is limited in scope and if you are anticipating much about the military side of the Civil War you will be disappointed. Because of this lack of breadth this might not amount to an Oscar-winning film. Nevertheless, it's a fascinating look at 19th century politics and boasts a towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Recommended.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|i think this is the best game because it has all the burds and it is like a compition betwen u and portibal divice.
B0083SBMBM|1.0|As a dedicated fan of Batman,and of DC Comics since my childhood,I wasn't even about to watch this overrated movie.But I was bored,so I thought what the hell.Maybe this movie could make me change my views about Marvel.Well...it didin't.My hatered for Marvel only got worse.I can't believe anybody would find this childish crap entertaining.One thing that I've always loved about Batman...especially Nolan's Batman,is how dark it was.Bottom line is,Marvel characters have always sucked and always will suck.Just look at how lame the Marvel villians are.Look at Batman's gallery of baddies.WAY better.If you love Marvel comics,you'll probally druel over this lame crap.But if you love DC,you'll hate it as much as I do.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This one is worth owning! The best M.I.B. yet! The ending is unbelievable, Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith did it again!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|This is the ONLY Saw movie that you wanna own.The other Saw films,just didin't have the same feel to them,as this one did.The storyline was very unique,and actually very realistic.I mean,this could REALLY happen.Cary Elwes does a great job in this film.Danny Glover also shines in his role as Detective Tapp.Overall,the original Saw is a true horror cult classic,and I think every horror fan needs to own a copy of this movie.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have been a fan of Stana Katic since seeing her in The Librarian:  The Curse of the Judas Chalice.  Well written dialogue.  Diverse cast of characters.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|Awesome movie a little dry at times but over all, one of those must see movies that blows your mind
B00005QZWI|4.0|I normally buy CD's vs. seeing the film release; since I am more passionate about music.  The two songs which Enya sings on are breathtakingly beautiful.  The other songs are fine - probably more interesting if you see the movie.  However this appears to be a very well-composed soundtrack.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think this book was ok not my fave why is there all these like not letters numbers or symbols things in the pronouncing
B000002URV|5.0|I have listened to other older Enigma releases, and in my opinion they don't come close to this one.  It's great to dance and work-out to...my main intention for buying it.
B009H442DG|5.0|This album is a joy! It's great. There is nothing to criticize! It's genuine and not the least bit corny. John & Olivia are in great voice. The arrangements are lush and very well done. No skimping here. John does not \\"talk\\" --he sings totally great in his John Travolta style- you can hear the smile in his voice-- eager to please and very ingenuous with perfect pitch.  The choice of songs is delightful. \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" is so cool in its style.  There's no way you will not like this album. Get it!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Whether or not you agree with the negative comments about Tim, his books make you think differently and this one does as well.<br /><br />I've already done the baked chicken and bacon infused bourbon with much success.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|It's was ok a time waster, but the whole idea of honest Abe as a vampire hunter is a goofy idea.  George Bush maybe with Saddam as the King of the Vampires might have worked better.
1455527475|4.0|Every nation at times has its powerful forces that either intentionally or unintentionally oppress the lives of its citizens. I liked Greg Smith's book because it exposes a rare insider's view to the destructive force that Goldman Sachs, and others in Wall Street like it, have become. I found the six page afterword the most powerful and compelling statement of the book. Most of us would be served well to read this section and make the connection between the economic suffering we are experiencing to the willful, reckless and unregulated trading activities of Wall Street companies like Goldman Sachs. Mr. Smith walked away from everything on Wall Street terms to implore us to force transparency and regulation on the trading activities of these financial companies. I believe this makes him a very credible witness to the financial and economic destruction wrought solely by the actions of companies like Goldman Sachs.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have so many CD's of songs from musicals, featuring both male and female singers, that I hesitated to buy this.  Same old songs.  But loving Susan Boyle's voice and the joy she brings to her singing, I bought it and am so glad that I did.  I think her interpretation and the subtle orchestration make the songs fresh and lovely. My very favorites, to my surprise, were As Long As He Needs Me and Out Here On My Own; she just sings her heart out on these.  They were exceptional, but all are excellent.  I would most definitely be jumping to my feet in a standing ovation were I to hear this in concert.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this is great for people like me who love puzzles, but have no one to play them with! thank you!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|One of the best moves I've seen all year. The opening sequence, with the main character growing up and growing old, is one of the most touching scenes I've ever seen in a movie. But the whole movie is a gem -- so much whimsy in one little classic.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I have a fire dragoon, water dragon,  wind dragon and forest dragon. Dragon story is a cool game I love my dragons. Thats why I like Dragon Story.
0696019973|4.0|AGAIN, THIS IS MY WIFE'S BOOK. WE PURCHASED 4 TOTAL. THEY ALL WERE VERY INFORMATIVE,HELPFUL AND<br />HAD CREATIVE IDEAS ON HOW TO USE THE CLOTH AND THE SEWING OF QUILTS.<br />VERY GOOD BOOKS FOR INTRODUCING QUILTING.<br />SEE THE OTHER REVIEWS.
B007TK77QE|2.0|I was very disappointed. I didn't like the story line at all. Child abuse, rape, drug use, poverty, foul language etc.<br />Not my idea of a good read. Being the author of the Harry Potter series I think I expected something different. The author must have decided to let loose her wild side.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|an astonishingly bad \\"musical.\\"  The insipid young lovers could be expected, but the film holds no musical value and the actors struggle with bad dialogue.  The only amusing/interesting moment is the Baldwin-Brand number \\"I Can't Fight the Feeling\\" as comic relief.  Worst of all is the PG-13 rating which must have resulted from a bribe or intense studio pressure.  There is nothing PG-13 about face licking, adult spanking, and violent sex in a bathroom.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Entertaining and fun......can play it for long lengths of time.  Has several levels of difficulty which I like.  I enjoy the different types of birds too.
B001P06GX4|5.0|You never know how this game will end up.  It's beyond fun and EVERYONE in the family can enjoy it.  Top on my list.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Whole family loves it.  Kind of difficult to figure out how to play from the written directions.  Suggest you invite an experienced player to show you the ropes.  After that, it is a blast.  Time to order some of the expansion sets.
B0052ZQMLO|2.0|Collins Concise German Dictionary.<br />This dictionary I use while reading german books. But it doesn't recognise words in their plural form or when slightly changed due to grammar requirements. therefor it works in less than half the occasions used.<br />Rens Zomerdijk
B008BM9L72|2.0|These books weren't for me. After all the hype and publicity they received I thought they must have been great books. I didn't like the abusive story line but obviously millions of people have enjoyed them, so perhaps my view is in the minority.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Macs. I use PCs. I use Kindles. I use desktops and phones and laptops and tablets. Evernote just works. it synchs and loads anywhere and everywhere I want it. That's. the kind of performance I admire in an app. Way to go, Evernote!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Rod Stewart's raspy vocals make these Xmas songs extra enjoyable for these festive tracks.  He has a perfect tone for these songs and is a legend.
B009FZFONO|5.0|By far one of the best originals from AMC. Mad men, Breaking Bad and this show puts AMC in a league of its own. All these shows have great acting in common and are not hesitant to push boundaries. The only downside is the irresistible urge to watch all episodes in one sitting :)
B0045EA1P6|4.0|I enjoyed this album more than their previous big radio hit. To be fair that may be due to the constant over playing of We Are Young. :)
0307405095|5.0|this book is so good ,i love baking and pies, the receapes are so easy...and they are delicioso..<br />the crust is really good.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|If you ever played a rush hour type of game where you move one car out of a lot blocked by others. In this case they are colorful blocks and you must move the red square to its indicafed location by moving the other blocks out of the way with minimal moves.<br /><br />I actually like the music and graphics in this game. The downside is it seems to be a bit buggy. If i reset a level sometimes the block your supposed to move will not appear.
B0090X4HES|3.0|alot of hype about  this  album and  Kendrick Lamar got  a  cold  flow  and  the production is  cool.  however i don't particular hear  what i'd call a money  track, however he has alot of upside with his skills.i  dig  his mixtape  game and i  like his timing.  i think the next couple of albums will expand his overall game. this is a  cool start though no doubt.  its  got a bit too much going on, however when his  records get a bit more polished up,he might be one whom you have to listen to for years to come.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is one of those movies that came along and amazingly became an instant classic! Funny and heartwarming from beginning to end, it is enjoyable for all ages!
B0011Z3DAC|4.0|The following review is written by my 13-year old son.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of nu-metal and stuff like that, and have been a devout Linkin Park fan for a while now. I really enjoyed Hybrid Theory and Meteora, and when I pressed \\"Play\\" on my media player and heard \\"Given Up\\", I thought that this was gonna be another nu-metal hit, with that gnarly 18-second scream. Then came \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\". I'll be honest; it wasn't really what I was expecting, but I really enjoyed the song, regardless of its softness. \\"Bleed It Out\\" was next on the list, and I really liked that, as well; Mike's rap, the chord progression on guitar, things like that. It had a lot of good aspects about it, plus it still stuck to that metal element we all know and love, as did \\"No More Sorrow\\".<br /><br />To prevent you from having to read a wall of text, I'll just say my opinions on the softer songs; \\"Shadow of the Day\\", \\"In Pieces\\", and (\\"soft\\" used loosely in this case), \\"Valentine's Day\\" are all tracks that get hated on a lot and really don't deserve it, along with \\"Hands Held High\\". I think the problem with the people that hate the album is like what happens to a lot of bands; they change their styles to fit in with the modern trends so they'll still stay at the stature they're at, or just because they'll get tired of having to listen to songs focused around angst and pent-up aggression. I think Dave Farrell, their bass player, said that in an interview once.<br /><br />I may be speaking for just myself (but unlikely), though, when I say that \\"Little Things Give You Away\\" is probably the best song on the album. I think it may be the first song I've heard by them that even has a little dash of romantic to it. It still has that 'dark' feeling, with the narrator recognizing that they're about to drown six feet underwater, but he's realizing that the person that he needed was right there beside him, wanting desperately to be looked up to. It is indeed a fantastic song, and probably my favorite out of them all. I recommend this album, falling just short of greatness.orite out of them all. I recommend this album, falling just short of greatness.
B005M2A4DE|5.0|You know if you enjoy the current Doctor Who. I tend to think that if you like Joss Whedon's sensibilities, you will like the current Doctor Who show as Stephen Moffet has sensibilities that are similar (not the same - the work is not at all the same - but the humor mixed with seriousness is).
B00975L81Y|2.0|A harder outing than recent albums and without a lot of the male/female harmonies which I enjoy in their music. Nothing wrong with perusing new directions by artists only that this direction was not to my liking.
B0086449YA|5.0|Once again Knopfler delivers a fine collection. Of course, I expected nothing less. I've been a fan since Dire Straits but, I must say I prefer his solo career. Seems he's been more creative going it alone.<br />And this double-disc release is no exception. The title track is my favorite cut, but they all shine. Why this is only available as an import I'll never know.<br />If you a fan of the man's solo work, get this. If you're looking for Money for Nothing, you'll be disappointed.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this appxis so awesome! I wanted it for a while and when I got it I was so happy I started playing right away!!!! I also love that unlike Tiny Monsters they don't force you to pay for fifty million things every single minute if you want to be successful
B0090EHVMC|5.0|It's a hit at our home, cute funny characters and good values in the story! And, Betty White does one of the character voices, so you know it will be funny at times!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great cast and very realistic characters.  They are all retirement age, and for various reasons, (financial, loneliness) are looking for a place to which to retire .  They settle on a defunct hotel in India advertised as a retirement hotel.  It was a family owned business which the youngest son is trying to resurrect.  The new &#34;residents&#34; have various reactions to being there - some adapt, some don't.  A very heart-warming story.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|I love Muse but this seemed almost &#34;too much&#34; - I read some comments by the lead singer that I found reflected my feelings exactly on this work. A bit too bombastic. It isn't that you want subtlety from MUSE - far from it - but a little restraint in the arrangements would have improved the work.
1419553429|5.0|This book has many practice questions and helpful hints to remember while you are studying for the GMAT. I highly recommend using this book, it worked for me!
B0017XFBMG|5.0|I've been eyeing this set since it came out. Kept waiting for a US release. It hasn't come. So I ordered the import. Worth the wait.<br /><br />This really is a treasure trove my friends. Who needs a boxed set of singles and deep album cuts. The Pogues have done it right. Demos, live cuts, unissued tracks, even rehearsal recordings. Who knew the band tackled Rod Stewart's Maggie May? I didn't. Those songs not included the Sid & Nancy soundtrack CD? They're here. A sampling of studio and live cuts with the mighty Joe Strummer at the mic? Check.<br />Nothing could have made this a better set. Hands down the best boxed set I own.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was such an emotional rollercoaster, I'm still feeling the feels! I feel this is the right way hunger games could have ended, not too sappy and happy not too sad
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A very challenging game easy to play. Lots of levels so not boring either. Don't like the ads on opening though that's the price of a free game
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Loved this movie. It is a great chick flick! Somewhat predictable, but still a great movie. I rarely watch movies over again, but I would see this one again!
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie leaves out a few things and changes a few things from the book that really change the story.  I still love it and can't wait until the next movie.
B000068CNX|4.0|The girl I got this for loves it! She especially loves the behind the out takes and deleted scenes the most
B007Q0OV6Q|4.0|Yes, these Lego Advent Calendars are expensive for what is in the box and every year there seems to be fewer pieces.  However, my children love Legos, and love getting a small Lego gift every day in December.  You are not only paying for the little plastic Lego pieces, but you are buying those smiles each morning in December as you children open that day's door and quickly snaps together the kit before leaving for school.  -We will continue to buy these kits, even as the price goes up and the number of pieces keeps dropping.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This items arrived well before the expected date!  All 8 movies in a single box - love the efficiency & compactness of it!
B00A31UXLW|2.0|Although a long time fan of the Harry Bosch novels I think on this occasion Michael Connelly has \\"jumped the shark\\".  The general premise of the novel lays a fine foundation for another Bosch investigation but Connelly seems to have contrived an ending that, to my mind, spoils the whole book. This sequence of events starts with a kidnapping that would never have held up had it reached a court, then the conjuring up of a miraculous Bosch escape, followed by an unlikely helicopter crash.  Up until these elements were introduced I enjoyed the book and the way in which Connelly put together the links in an investigation, however, on this occasion it was a limp ending that spoiled the experience.  Perhaps Connelly is losing his Bosch mojo?
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Awesome settings and powerful female lead. They say that it is coming and I am looking forward to the sequel.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game by glue mobile. Inc love it cant wait for a part two cause this game is awesome. and love glue mobile games
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|I wanted to watch this movie when it first came out around the Halloween season but never had the chance.  To watch it in the middle of the Christmas holidays was a little strange but the movie was so cute it just didn't matter!  Very well done!  I think I might even buy the DVD to watch anytime I please - maybe on Valentine's Day!!  :&#62;)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a great end to the series, making me want another page turner and hoping movies come of the second and third.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Growing up in the south I've heard stories similar to those portrayed in this movie. This movie made me laugh and cringe.
B004FOA84A|4.0|loved this game! It was a lot of fun to play, yet very challenging at the same time. I only wish it lasted longer.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Great story line, great actors and actresses, great setting and very meaningful in its view of the young starting and the mature coming to their sunset years.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|The first Expendables was enjoyable if cheesy. This one had the plot and special effects of a bad made-for-tv movie. It is not worth paying for.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|There are some truly hilarious lines in this movie, & so much truth about being single. I loved it, & definitely recommend it for some light entertainment.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It's always good for a series to keep you interested, this one will not let you down, great build up to the final book.
B004EPZ0H0|5.0|Fantasticallly written, empathetic and superb.  Rebecca has done a wonderful job of combining science and the Lack's story enabling scientists and lay people alike to understand the implications these things can have on a whole family's life.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Steven Wilson is the master of audio quality, and he assembled a really quality group of musicians for this disc. I've seen quite a few concert DVDs and Blurays, none better than this one. The DTS-HD audio is perfectly mixed -- quiet when it should be and roaring loud at the right moments. Will buy more Steven Wilson concerts immediately upon release.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Intriguing. Good read even though the subject matter was disturbing.  Suzanne Collins does  good job emotionally  walking you through the book without a lot of gruesome detail.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The writing and story are very engrossing and fun to read. I would have liked some more explanations at some parts, but overall this is a good book.
B008K4JDLA|5.0|Well done, again Mr Anderson. I loved this book and what I liked most was Anderson goes into specifics. This book is positive and hopefully a vision of a positive future for Western economies.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't want to read the books but after MUCH coaxing from friends and family I decided to give it a shot. I felt the story line was a bit too ridiculous for me. The writing itself was mediocre and repetitive. Needless to say, the second and third books will remain unpurchased by me.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|i love it..rod stewart and christmas are great together. I love his voice and the song choices that he picked
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie. I didn't read anything about it so that nothing would be spoiled for me. I did see the poster of Bane and I was not impressed.<br /><br />The day the movie was delivered I popped that sucker in my BR player.<br />I heard a voice.... praying with all my heart that it was a \\"henchman\\" or somebody of no importance.<br />Sigh.... this was the voice of the big bad villian.<br /><br />I cannot believe that after the terror that was Batman's voice in the last movie that this would slip though the cracks. Who in their right mind thought that this was a good idea?? On top of that, the story was all over the place, I was completely lost the whole time. I even had to read the summary on Wikipedia just to understand.<br /><br />**** Spoiler *****<br />One thing in particular that I hated was that when the Batman was \\"broken\\" it looked like a badly played wrestling move, even though I didn't see the wire, I surely could tell it was there. I didn't even know that the Batman had been broken until a side character had to tell me that he was in fact broken.<br />**** End Spoiler****<br /><br />I ended up not even keeping the movie and listed it on eBay.<br />Such a sad ending to a series with great potential.<br />..Sleep well Dark Knight
B000QUUD60|5.0|excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book!! Lots of suspense and a very intriguing plot. This book covers the idea of survival, classism and equal rights.  I'd recommend this to anyone who might enjoy fiction integrated with reality!
B003WUYP56|3.0|I'm wanting to understand my universe better but at age 57, much of my current upgrading comes from the history and national geographic channels. I'm only 45 or so pages into the book and I read it in doses... I just barely follow all of the references to all of the theories and their details (sometimes I feel I need to stop and read a book about each subject quickly and then return). I appreciate the purpose of unification and it is basically why I am reading this book. I will finish this book and be glad I did but as reading is recreational and thinking on this level is closer to hard work than fun... there is just enough content to keep a motivated reader (me, who wants to better understand the universe) moving slowly through the book.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|I really enjoy this CD by Drake.  I listened to it on Spotify for about a month, realized I liked almost every song, and then decided to buy the CD so I can listen to it locally, without internet connection on my Ipad and without the interruption on ads.  I like that each song has a good melody AND a good beat.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Excellent book.  So wonderful to<br />read about a policeman who really cares about the victim and the surviving family.  Exciting.
B00005JM02|5.0|It's a great movie for kids and adults.  I still love watching it over and over again with my daughter.

B007ATNHLI|5.0|So you have a classic movie & now its HD quality. You know what your getting.  It has aliens in it.
B00A3DZ61W|4.0|Pretty much what you would expect from angry birds with a little twist. It's fun but I get bored easily
B0098A1TEE|5.0|Very refreshing sound in the pop jazz world, IMO. Great songs and nothing too repetitive. I'd like to hear more from Caro.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|It's a great movie, what else is there to say about it?! Nothing like watching Wall-E save the day. :)
B0000AC8LR|5.0|A few months ago, I watched Donnie Darko (the theatrical release) here on Amazon Prime. I cannot get this movie out of my head. This is one of the most unique movies that I have ever seen. I cannot add anything new to this review because most of the other reviews pretty much sum it up. The script is excellent; The music is fantastic (one of my new favorite songs and ringtone is Head over heels by Tears for fears); The acting is also great. Because of the bunny I thought that Donnie Darko was a horror movie and it took me months to get up the nerve to watch it because I don't like horror movies with demonic type stuff. After reading several of the reviews here on Amazon, I concluded that that bunny may look like that but there is more to the bunny than meets the eye (no pun intended. You have to watch the movie to understand what I mean *Smile*) I don't have a full understanding of this movie. I have to watch it again but it is well worth viewing several times over alone and/or with others; definately with the input of your family, friends and associates. I must own this movie!  I feel that this movie is a cinematic masterpiece. *I am LC from NC*
B0084BMUFA|4.0|Motivational story about being generous, caring, and cherishing loved ones before death. Despite the Christmas theme, it's a great read for everyone.

0446567337|4.0|In Nicholas' Sparks novel, he has really outdone himself once again. Dear John is about a man who faces life head on with problems such as dealing with a shy and quiet father, a rebellious teenage past, his pride as an American soldier, and fighting to keep the love of his life. In this fiction story of true love, Nicholas Sparks shows readers the true meaning of sacrifices made for happiness. John comes home on leave from the war and he meets the girl who changes everything, Savannah. The book follows their lives together and apart, a drama complete with history of American war battles from the late 1900's and information about people with autsim. This book shows the true nature of humans and how everyone makes mistakes, forever changing the lives of another person.<br /><br /> I related to John's situation of being apart from someone you love, and I had a great connection with the characters in the story because of that. I loved how Sparks showed the story from a soldier's point of view, I learned a lot about the army that I had no idea about before. Sparks did a great job connecting outside world affair into the romance story, not only including army life, but also a lesson of autism and people with the illness. Also, I loved the reality in the story, unlike most romance novels where couples face a simple, one solution problem and recover from it.<br /><br />I wish Sparks would have focused more on John and his father's relationship and made a better connection between the two trying to get closer, more than just a silent battle for conversation between the two and then a life changing epiphany for John, bringing the two closer. Another thing I wish Sparks had done, was to have had more happen between John and Savannah after she sent her last letter to him. The story just fell into a hole of depression and left Savannah out of the picture for quite a while. If the author had made a better confrontation between the two characters after Savannah dropped the marriage bomb, I think the story would have turned out better.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed the eye catching plot and the complex romance with John and Savannah. The world affairs of war and mental illnesses tied into the story made it even better. Also, Nicholas Sparks caught my emotions with his writing, making me connect to the story as if I was the one living in the moment. I look forward to reading more of his work, hoping he can create another reality for me to live in.
0071766588|4.0|I just started using it but it seems a good book to start with preparing for the TOEFL. The tips are a bit repetitive, but again I would say that it is good that the message is reiterated several times.

B00AE2J5HI|3.0|A True chapter in American Cultrural History; however how did this chapter influnence local and national perspective of both, law enforcement power-centrist' , and the empoverished whose chose that route of illegal<br />endeavors to survive. Look at 1920's-1960's then 2012. We once again or, still,  have corrupt law enforcement, Govt. and Gangsters in the streets runing wild.<br /><br />During the 1920's through the 1960's there was  a groundswell of National Pride and strife among the masses,<br />to become A Productive, Patriotic & Proud, Presence in the World. We almost all, wanted to be CITIZENS. IT re-surged after Prohibition. Now Look who we are as a people. Just a thought about the puzzleing absence of an academy worthy epilog, to what could have been a societal, \\"paradigm shifting\\" classic film, to all sub-cultures here in America.

B004QX07G4|4.0|Not a hilarious book, but has some very good &#34;life&#34; things to think about.  If you like Ellen, you will like this book.  It is typical Ellen humor.
B009LRE040|5.0|This movie lived up to the billing.  I've already watched it three times.  I really enjoyed the pair of Anne Hathaway and Christian Bale.
B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Not as good as the first 2. I think the writers need to stick to the Baltimore School of Arts story lines.
B003QS9SGA|5.0|Heath Ledger is such an outstanding actor that you love him, laugh with him, cry with him, wish you knew him.  Bravo to all the actors who were equally up to the task.  This movie is the best!  I've watched it many times and will never get tired of it.
0241955025|5.0|The financial news since 2008 is enough to give me an ulcer so this slightly humorous take on the world financial scene is a welcome relief while still informing.

B0088749CW|4.0|Tall Man was about a small town that had a number of kids that come up missing and what did the Tall Man have to do with the missing kids. I wanted to watch TM because it has the same director that did the movie Martyrs. You can't go into TM wanting to see Martyrs 2.  This is slower and a lot less blood. Not to give to much away the first part of the movie seems to tell the story in mystical way and the last part of the movie seems to have a more real world solution to the story. TM had a couple of twists you may or may not like but I think it's worth a watch.
B001JYEMOQ|5.0|&#34;Tis not your average love story. In fact, it is not a love story at all. Enchanting from the start. &#34;Be yourself&#34; is wise advice, they say, but what if yourself's only skill is faking it. That is the question this film asks. What would it be like of your only skills were imitation, forgery, and theft. &#34;It began with this coat I borrowed...&#34; Nice narrative hook. It makes you want more info about &#34;it&#34; (so portentous) and how so mundane an act as borrowing a coat could lead to a significant &#34;it.&#34;
B00005NB8K|5.0|I felt this movie was from the eyes of Oliver Stone and not the true Jim Morrison. Jim had a high IQ but lived out of control which ended his life.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I'm a gal who enjoys sci-fi and casual games, but I've never really played Halo. Turns out that wasn't a deterrent at all when it came to liking the movie.<br /><br />Like many, I started the first part without a whole lot of expectations (though Anna Popplewell -- of Narnia fame -- being involved was a somewhat positive sign), then was completely drawn in by the story, the music, and the \\"big budget\\" feel -- quality in every shot. It reminded me of BSG in a good way. If you generally like sci-fi, but don't know much about Halo, there's still an excellent chance you'll enjoy this, so give it a shot if some Halo fan in your life wants you to see it with them!<br /><br />** Somewhat SPOILERY commentary ahead **<br />I've now seen the version on the web, which broke the movie up into 5 parts, as well as the full feature on Blu-ray, and I actually really liked the way it was done on the web. (At time of this writing, the first two episodes are still free to watch on YouTube, but the final three parts are not.) Each part is preceded by an intro clip of Cortana going crazy (\\"rampant\\") on board the Forward Unto Dawn, contemplating bringing Master Chief out of cryo. This has little to do with the plot of the main story itself, but ties in at the end. The Blu-ray/DVD feature instead bookends the Cortana/Chief scenes at the beginning and end, so that the movie is uninterrupted. Also you get a bit of extra footage in the latter version. Obviously, the difference isn't that great between the two; the same basic content is there, and that's all that really matters.<br />** End spoilers **<br /><br />This movie *is* setup for the Halo 4 game, so while it's surprisingly self contained given that, if you want to find out more about the fates of the two protagonists (Lasky and Master Chief), you'll have to play Halo 4 or watch the cut scenes from the game on YouTube. ;) I don't think that's necessary to enjoy this movie, however!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Best app ever once u get it,it starts off easy but when u get farther it gets harder U SHOULD GET THIS APP NOW
0316227706|4.0|The idea is of taking underwater pix of dogs is revolutionary and the purchase is certainly worth it. Yet, my mistake, I hadn't realized that the book's dimensions do not allow any larger picture. Double-page images being cut right in the middle due to the binding, the pictures appear less beautiful than they could.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Just what I needed, and free at that!  I payed $1.99 for the same sort of app for my B&B Nook.
B00992CF6W|4.0|when I first got minecraft pe it was ok but when the the updates comes out it gets even better.<br />and if you want to buy it it has a little trobble downloading. all in all its a fun game and you should get it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This third installment is much less predictable than the first two novels, making any short lulls in the storyline easier to ignore. Definitely worth the read.
1451627297|5.0|As a typical &#34;hardcore&#34; Stephen King fan, I have read everything he has written. I have not loved it all. In my mind, the most successful books Mr. King has written are the ones in which he successfully creates a world. An entire, living, breathing world. He has done this many times, and I am always amazed at how perfectly he manages this feat. He has been called &#34;masterful&#34;. He truly is. His worlds don't just include fully fleshed out characters so real you think about them like they are people. His worlds also include the sounds, smells, sights, tastes, and feelings one experiences in actual life. November 22, 1963 does this so well that I feel like I lived in that time period now. I feel as if I have actual first hand knowledge of what it was like to be a citizen in the United States during that era. He does not miss a trick- from his perfect descriptions of the taste of milk-delivered from bottles- and real, rich rootbeer, to the smokey cigarette air- because everyone smokes- to the music on the radio, the prices of everything...it is a rich history lesson. Going to Derry, as a Stephen King fan, is always, always satisfying too. Learning so much about the history of the Kennedy assassination is amazing (I was born in 1966 and missed it) ...his research is clearly exhaustive and impeccable. But, in the end, what I loved most were the little things. The linebacker turned actor and the play he was a part of- the scene is so beautiful it had me crying. These kind of details add the sense of richness and fullness and make the book feel real: these are why Stephen King is a master. Read the book. Take a trip back in time when things were a bit more simple. Walk around and breath the smoky air and enjoy the scenery. Learn something new while you're at it. I feel certain you will be sad to return to 2012. I know I was.
B00004YA66|5.0|My family love this movie, My grandsons watch it all the time.  i know it is an older move but my teenage grandsons love it and ask to borrow or come by to watch all the time.
0385505833|4.0|Fun read.  I really enjoy reading his &#34;lawyer&#34; genre, but this one is also worth my money and my time. There have been times when I have thought of &#34;skipping&#34; the Christmas madness; just couldn't do it.
1451638450|5.0|A great story.  I should have read the timeline in back before I started the novel.  This is set BEFORE Cryoburn.  The usually rollicking good tale by Lois McMaster Bujold.  I really enjoyed Ivan being the central character.
B008B68IEA|5.0|great item my granddaughter and niece both love it and have a great time playing with it well worth the money!!!!
B005XI9456|4.0|I'll admit it- I enjoy Justin Bieber even though I'm pushing 30! I think he has a great voice and I feel it's been awhile since I've enjoyed a new Christmas song from a recent artist. I could really do without him &#34;rapping&#34; though.
B006VREHRS|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW! GREAT ACTING TELENT AND STORY LINE. I'M ADDICTED TO THIS SHOW AND LOOK FORWARD TO MORE SEASONS
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Who doesn't love Nookie! This season is amazing and action packed! Way better than the first! Can't wait for season three!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|i found this movie very boring, also no real humor , frankly not worth the 3.99 it cost me to rent it

B002NVTSGQ|5.0|This was easy to set-up and operate on my laptop. Also easy to be interrupted and pick it up right where we left if off.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This was great. The last couple of books were not that good, so I was really hoping this would be better. I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this book.
B009ZM7FWU|5.0|A MUST SEE TRUE STORY FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. UNBELIEVABLE, SAD ! THE ACTORS ARE TALENTED AND TELL A STORY THAT WILL HAVE YOU AT THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I loved this story, the way the story is told and the animation is wonderful.  It is a movie adults can enjoy as well as children and it has a moral to it for many spoiled children and their unwillingness to listen to their elders.  At the same time adults can learn how to better relate to children.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|A local construction company built around a house downtown Portland, Oregon recently.  Interesting to see the similarities with the homeowner and city dispute.  Enjoyable movie for all ages.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great fast read non stop suspense I would recommend this book to any one ,I could not stop reading late into the night.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of the best books. i am not a reader and i read this is in 3 days.. highly recommended
B000JML7EC|3.0|Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again
B008QTVNUI|4.0|I have heard alot about this series, I like it. Made no sense to me tha Carrie and Brody would end up in bed as I believe she is smarter than that.  Don't know what audience the writers were shooting for but in my opinion that behavior dumbed Carrie down.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Allows easy browsing of folders. The app has a  straight forward interface. The search function is easy to use and it's free.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It was a great book!  I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />I would recommend it to others.  It was enjoyable and it was apart of our book club reading.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|I originally ordered this film because my nickname is Wally and I was curious.  It did have a slow start but after that it was fasinating.  Very creative.  It turns out that not only is it a love story showing that opposites really do attract but a vision into our future if we aren't careful.
B00973902K|5.0|my daughter is obsessed with this song.  i sing it to her and play it for her if she's fussy and she cheers up asap.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again
0679805273|5.0|I like this book because it is not only a good message for children to hear over ahis book and over again, it's message carries over for adults as well.  I work in a program treating people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol.  I give this book at graduation.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Love it!!!  I think it's better than both of her previous CD's.  She's definitely getting better at singing.  Make sure to get the explicit version...the way Kesha casually slips in profanity is beautiful.
0439023521|1.0|I read it, and burned it.  An entire book dedicated to a group of people killing each other for sport is not my idea of a worthwhile read.
B006TLFIAQ|1.0|It did not come with a digital copy as in the picture of the movie cover the movie I should have returned it
0689835604|4.0|This book is written short n sweet, keeping my little one's attention.  Great for teaching body parts, though i wish the pages were a little more durable.  Still my baby liked it so i give it 4 stars
B000JQUMPI|3.0|Nice book. Great for kids. I bought a bunch of the classics for my two daughters. Great price and would probably buy again
B00A7CI82I|2.0|This movie, unlike other Bourne movies, was hard to keep track of.  I like Bourne movies because in the past they have kept my attention and were exciting to watch.  I paid $15.00  for a movie that was not entertaining.
B000I3W1XS|4.0|Overall, the movie was all right. Just a bit over the top with the Klingon leader Kruge and his interactions with his crew and the Enterprise crew.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Interesting book which was easy to read. The book's ending left me wishing for closure though.  Five stars if ending had been a bit more complete.
B000T0HI1A|5.0|this is an overlooked album. i think it came at a time when there was some dylan fatigue and the initial mastering job was subpar. however, this is a spectacular album and easily one of dylan's top 5. its a big full album with a lot of sound, background vocals and a fair amount of boogie. the standouts on this LP are: changing of the guards, senor, we better talk this over and where are you tonight. if you dont already own this album then you must buy it but get the remastered version.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|This was a great movie. Way better than I expected, and my 8-year-old daughter loved it too. We were both laughing throughout the whole movie. I would recommend it for the whole family.
6304779356|5.0|great movie...oldie but a goodie and stars the late Corey Haim. I highly suggest it and recommend it. Best vampire movie!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this for my kids for Christmas so they don't know they have it yet. Their grandma took them to see it in theaters and they loved it, it's all they talked about for months. It's a cute little movie with a good message and great music.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book, easy read. Sad and funny at same time. I fell in love with Enzo from the beginning. Would recommend to all dog lovers.
1451695195|5.0|This book was a wonderful read, it got to me in a very timely fashion, and I am very please!
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This is by far the best Robin Hood movie I've ever seen and I've seen several. This one is good enough to watch over and over. It is also one that is action packed and keeps you very attentive. It seems to add more of an historical element which is lacking in other Robin Hood flicks. Great action and romance...
B00A7CI82I|2.0|Worst ever I totally regret I bought it, He actually comes in contact with three people that's it. The whole movie is about him running that's it. 3 I repeat 3 people he physically touched and got into a fight with. Shame !!!! boo
B007HACDLK|3.0|This has been an enjoyable series, and yes I know it's fiction, but the story line is getting predictable and unbelievable. The hero getting older and his mentor getting cancer, can anyone say Tom Clancy. Maybe it's time for Mitch to train his replacement.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This was my favorite movie when i was little so I bought it to watch with my kids. There are some parts that could be scary for younger kids but it's still one of the greatest movies of all times. It's a classic and you can't beat a classic.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I give it three stars only because of the annoying advertising that pops up every time you start a new game, it is worse than a constant tooth ache.  Since it is a free download apparently you are stuck with having to put up with the ads, if that doesn't bother you the game is very good.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|This was an ok movie but I am not a bit Men In Black fan. My husband liked it better than I. Has great effects though.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is an uplifting story. It puts you in the middle of two extreme age spectrums and how they can benefit from each other's perspective. Great for children and adults of all ages!! Plan to watch over & over!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Absolute Must see movie. We had high expectations before we went for the movie and glad to say we were not at all disappointed. The focus is on the characters and not just the location.<br />Fantastic job!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Being a FF fan I had to get it, and wow was I impressed. sure its 15 bucks but believe me its worth the money. especially if your a fan of the series you will not be disappointed!!!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|It's just a wonderful movie. It's great for all ages, all of my kids love it and they are 6, 3, & 1.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Angry birds, is fun and challenging, but the advertisement that constantly pops ups is not only irritating but makes you feel like an &#34;Angry Bird&#34; having to put up with them.  As has been said nothing in life is free, so by getting a free download you have to apparently put up the constant annoying ads that you cannot get rid of, according to Amazon and the company who makes the game.  Before downloading beware.
0399157565|1.0|I find myself getting very restless when a book meanders like this one does. I was, literally, bored out of my skull. If you want to read a book about a supposedly smart, powerful woman who worries constantly about the dysfunctional people in her life, Cornwell's books are for you.<br />I find the layouts of her books annoying as well: big margins, big type, lots of empty pages included in the number of pages even tho they are blank. I also don't like all the plugs for products or companies she puts in here lately.<br />I keep hoping Scarpetta will finally grow up, stop being so polite to these moody emotional vampires around her and kick some ass. But it seems she's a study in co-dependency instead.<br />I agree, Cornwell needs a new editor. The last book I enjoyed was several years ago called simply, \\"Scarpetta\\" and I still didn't understand what was happening nor why she included dwarfs in it until the very end.<br />Kay Scarpetta ( or Cornwell) needs a vacation instead of picking my pocket with these soap opera dramas.<br />I will rent from the library next time and give it back if she doesn't catch me in the first few chapters<br />It seems Patricia Cornwell is trading off her past brilliance and that can only last so long.<br />Maybe you're rich enough already Ms, Cornwell and should stop boring your fans stiff for a few dollars more
B002BBJ52U|1.0|Just really cheesy lackluster movie. I could hear these ideas from people on the street. Not impressed with the acting or the direction of the movie. Expected more. Husband fell asleep after first ten minutes. I did not watch 'til end.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Most helpful when reading for instant information on unfamiliar words. Type a few letters and possible word examples are suggested. Also pronounces word and gives synonyms and anonyms and word history.
B006FE83V8|5.0|Not much to say other than this is a great movie. A must own in everyones life. Everyone needs Atticus Finch for a father figure.
B000IDGDPA|4.0|It was a good story. Lots of British dry humor.  Helen Hunt was fantastic, I enjoyed the movie and reccomend it<br />to others
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Movie was one piece and great shape .  The best movie I've seen in awhile.  Can't wait for Avengers 2.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|I have have had a blast with this game. Reminds me of the first pinball game I ever played. Of course it has much better graphics!
B00170DEM8|4.0|Just a bit tired of seeing one guy steal the other guy's girl as in many classic movies, but this one has a bit of a twist at the end. However, who could get tired of hearing Bing Crosby sing and watching Fred Astaire dance?!
1401308201|5.0|I took my first group of drama students to Wicked and having this book gave us much to discuss on our return to the classroom.  It is an expansive volume of everything Wicked.
B0086700CM|3.0|This was a game that my son was able to play he would say it was great but i could not get the hang of it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|FB is better on the web.  The app lets you update, but the load is slow and the font is hard to read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the recipes, love the great do it yourself projects, and most of all love the inspiring quotes. 5 stars
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This camera takes great pictures BUT, it faces the user! Very hard to take pictures of others with it. If you give it someone and have them take their own pic, they are great quality.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Saw this with my grandkids and later my husband. It is an entertaining movie. There are heroes and those who do the right thing in spite of earlier mistakes. A real feel good movie.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Author: Fanny Merkin & Andrew Shaffer<br />Published By: Da Capo Press<br />Age Recommended: Adult<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Blog For: GMTA<br />Rating: 4<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shames of Earl Grey\\" by Fanny Merkin and Andrew Shaffer was some interesting read that truly kept me laughing all the way through this hilarious novel. This was a definitely a story that I was found wondering just what craziness this author(s) would bring on next. Wow! It is my understanding that this is a parody in that these authors spoof of the very popular 50 Shades of Grey...where Mr. Earl Grey..was a corporate tycoon..a rich guy, that could buy anything..had his own secrets or his \\"Fifty Shames.\\" Then there is Anna Steal, a naive college student and Walmart cashier who meets Earl Grey..well this is where I say you must pick up this read..\\"Fifty Shames of Earl Grey\\" and just maybe you will be smiling at some on this funny read. I know many will say this is a ridiculous read but just remember this is a parody and it is supposed to be funny..sort of like 'Airplane and Naked Gun.'<br /><br />These authors did a good job of taking these of the original book and completely creating other scenarios and these could only put a smile on your face. These authors did a good job of taking these of the original book and completely creating other scenarios and these could only put a smile on your face.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good novel that pokes fun in all the right places then pick up \\"Fifty Shames of Earl Grey\\" ....for I would recommend to you as a good read.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|As always a good program, i still get stuck at a few spots but that is what the grandchild is for.
B009O2XY12|4.0|Good game, easy to become addicted. The only problem is the levels are so similar to each other, that is my only complaint.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|Pinocchio is not only Disney's finest cartoon masterpiece, but perhaps his most enduring moral tale.  Who can forget the shocking fate of Lampwick and his fellow &#34;ne'er-do-wells&#34; at the hands of the sinister carnival barkers?  It is comforting that this tale is one of redemption and not tragedy, and the beautiful music is as memorable as any our culture has produced for children to absorb and profit from.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|To keep the ads off I just turn off my WIFI. I am loving the new Christmas levels where you get a new puzzle everyday.  I think this is the best version so far.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|We enjoyed this move (12 y.o. daughter and mom).  It has a good moral and kept us entertained throughout.  Recommend.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|keeps saying network error and I have only played once..on my kindle fire....very dissapointing I have played with friends and love the game but cant on My own device
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love kindle better than barnes and noble if you want to find booklending.com or fee listings this is the way to go.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I'm a Mahjong addict, and this is by far one of my favorite. Great graphics and as you move along in the quest you get different sets of tiles, so you don't get too used to the same ones. I happen to find music relaxing and it calms me when I'm tense. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Mahjong, there are also different modes so you get to choose how you want to play, another added bonus. Get it you won't be dissappoint!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This story is as good as any Disney ever told, and it is animated with great love and care.  it is a treasure of our cultural heritage.
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|In an environment of cheesy, cheap, shake-your-booty Santa stories, this is the true &#34;now&#34; Christmas story!  It answers the questions of the contemporary child with humor and heart.  It wraps the legend of Santa and the advances of today into an adventurous plot. The characters are outrageously adorable and the computer animation is spectacular.  I found one flaw in the editing, but then I've watched it over a dozen times.  I'll let you find this minor bit on your own, and in the meanwhile I'm sure you'll agree Arthur Christmas is an immediate classic
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Arthur Christmas takes a witty, contemporary approach to the Santa Clause story.  Santa's N Pole operation has gone corporate.  There are multiple generations of Santa's each more interested in their legacy, and drunk with the power of the role (and in the case of Grandpa Santa, I suspect a bit of schnapps as well) than the role itself.  The result is a funny concoction that is a cross between Dilbert and Twas the Night Before Christmas.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book keeps the reader guessing and turning the pages to find out what happens next.  The ending will be a surprise.  It is a good, quick, interesting read.
B008GAXUYE|5.0|I bought this despite already having 31 of the 51 disks.  Then there are 4 historical dupicate disks and (for me) only 17 new ones.    The songs are world class, the symphonies are as well.  The suites (jazz, ballet, movie) are 10/10 at Classics Today, as well as the unrivaled reference recording of Lady Macbeth.  Since my versions of string quartets, concertos, some other chamber music and piano music are different, I cannot say that these ones are \\"bad\\".  An Amazon UK reviewer loves these SQs.  If they are, then so what - get the Ashkenazy Piano set and the Brodsky (or other) SQ set.    On the movie scores, they look to be fairly complete.  There also the incomplete operas and there is even a CD of music Dmitry orchestrated, written by others.    NOTE: There a mistake on Amazon.de and this was 40 Euro cheaper for about a day.  Still at the full price, the cost is about $100.  A great bargain, and a great set.  The songs are just wonderful - I am so glad Brilliant Classics got the license for them.    The booklet is an excellent essay, but nothing else.  There are no texts to any of the music, which is a real bummer.  Still, 5 stars for the high quality and wide selection provided.    Here is a great link for the texts.  They accept donations: [...]
B00064WSN2|5.0|Although nothing ever equalled the iconic \\"In the court of the Crimson King\\" this followup is great in its own right. It still has the original band together, however brief and still had the one of a kind voice of Greg Lake. Definitely worth a lot of listens for the early progressive rock fan.
B00881VLCE|5.0|If you are a puzzle wizard like me you will love these puzzles. It has 5 different levels of size to choose from. They have free ones to download and some will cost you .99 cents. You can download a lot of free ones. You get about 4 or 5 puzzles with each one. When you install it on your kindle fire it comes with about 30 puzzles to start. It has a photo you can pull up of the current photo you are doing. The graphics are great and the colors are very vivid. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B005NFJAXU|4.0|I never watched this series on commercial tv because I do not enjoy waiting for the next episode.<br />Also continuity is broken with so many commercials.<br /><br />The series is great, even though some of the things in the series are a direct affront to Christianity (I know it is fantasy,<br />but some language and action - a bit too much).<br /><br />Also, some plots go on too long, such as the whole angels and demons apocalypse episodes. Sometimes series &#34;too dark.&#34;
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not much actions. The worst MIB ever! My wife fell asleep and I almost did but since I took a nap in the afternoon, I was able to stay awake and determine not to waste my $3.99 rental fee. The commercials only show the nice part of the movie. I probably watched this movie even if there are many negative reviews since other two MIB were nice. Baite and Switch
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite books and the message behind it is brilliant. Gives you so much to think about! Seee the movie too. Very entertaining and one of the better book adaptations I've seen!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I was fascinated by the presentation of the story from the perspective of the murdered girl.  The author has presented a wonderfully intriguing pilgrimmage of the killers capture.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|movie was as expected phone holders worked and everyday with Lauren was nor what i wanted i wanted the book
B008N1V11U|1.0|this is terrible I have tried to download this game for my son since last night and it wont every time I click buy app enter my password and try to download the game it says downloading for about two seconds and than says an error downloading yet I can download free apps no problem
0593070631|5.0|This book is incredibly entertaining, and a must read for all McFly fans. I finished it in two days, I couldn't put it down! It has all the inside info about the beginning stages of the band, which is pretty cool, as well as the guys' childhood stories. Lots of funny anecdotes and even some of their own personal struggles are documented in this book. Of course, it talks about the music and I found myself comforted and hopeful for what's to come in their future as a band and particularly about the direction of their next studio album, which promises to be a return to true McFly form... AKA AWESOME! McFly fans, you will absolutely love this.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is so much fun and full of information.  Love seeing the world through other people's eyes and interests.  Lots of fun craft, decorating ideas and great recipes. Hard-to-find vegetarian and great appetizer ideas and recipes
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This was a great read. i knew I had to read it after I saw the movie as the movie was very hard to follow and too much information to swallow in three hours. However, I somehow knew I would like the storyline if I had time to absorb it. Sure enough, it is far more entertaining when read. The movie stinks by comparison.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I like this series alot.  Started reading and got caught up in the story and now can't stop reading.  My whole family is reading it now.
B0035G04TI|5.0|I have already read some and it really is an excellent way to improve your relationships. I am buying this for all my 6 children to learn from.
B0018BB20W|5.0|fabulas!!!  Wonderful sound, wonderful songs.  Good selection of songs and the orchestra sounds clear with a serene quality to it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Ok... So, this book was alright for me. My issue with it was that the last few chapters of the book felt rushed to me and the way some of main characters were dealt with felt like it didn't match up with what we've been hearing for the past two books. Overall this is a great book series and this final book was enjoyable.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I enjoyed the characters and story line.  I think adults would appreciate<br />it more than little children. Colorful and cute.
B000I9YX06|5.0|He was very happy with the movie.<br />It was a gift, he will be able to enjoy more than once.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|Ity took me watching a couple of episoides before I became hooked, even got my daughter hooked on it, and she usually does not care for this type of series. But found the main character to be a hoot.Really a great series.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|How s often  I've sent the wrong message,!<br />The characters were developed well.<br />Fostering is a difficult task for both parent and child..<br />We all need much support,lovingly given to grow.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|Loved the game when it first came out, love it now. I will never stop playing this game! It keeps me entertained for hours on end, though there are a few things that kind of throw me off... Such as building roller coasters, sometimes it doesn't work for no reason.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, in my opinion is the best one out of the series. It's exciting and intriguing from the start and of course it leaves you wanting to read the third book ASAP! Loved it.
0395389496|5.0|I bought this one for my son who has such a great imagination.  This is a beautiful story...well made book also!
B00008G7UF|5.0|French Kiss is an entertaining love story.  The plus are the parts played by Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan.  Both very talented actors who seem not fitted for each other in this film, do find love, not necessarily commonality.  I recommend for anyone who enjoys a light and funny movie.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|fun but controls need improving. not very responsive. also force closes alot. there also needs to be a way to save your progress so when you re-install you don't have to start over again. please fix and I'll rate 5 stars.
B002361MLA|5.0|Eckhart's style is most readable and well suited for those who are not familiar with the &#34;technical&#34; terms used in Buddhist and other writings on the subject.  He has a gift for communication that comes from what he has realized, and it shows in the clear and lucid way he describes the process.  I think he is a valuable complement to Adyashanti, who tends to focus on how to deal with issues arising after awakening, while Eckhart focuses on those of us who perhaps have an intuition and drive to awaken but have not had the experience.  I think the book is an excellent resource for any seeker.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This came before the Pacific, I saw this plenty of times, but still... This was the best series of any show I have ever watched. It might be because I love World War II, specifically the European theatre, but it is still the best in my book... And that'll never change!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|This is my favorite xmas movie and a no-brainer purchase if you're a muppets fan. Brilliant re-make of Charles Dickens' classic novel with music (by the legendary Paul Williams) that should be on everyone's xmas music playlist! Buy this, then buy Emmett Otter's Jugband Xmas!
B007TK77QE|2.0|never got into the story really - slow to take off, slow to continue - not her best book.  Sorry
145210655X|4.0|My 9 Year Old Daughter found and fell in love with this book when we were in a local big book chain.<br /><br />Fun. Light. and at the Amazon (or eBay) price, absolutely worth every penny.
B002VWNICW|5.0|I give this movie a five star rating because the acting was superb, the story very close to the book, and the scenery and music was beautiful. There was not enough time in the movie for full character development, but the plot was played to perfection.
B004LP601S|5.0|I don't have the actual album yet, but I have heard the album over and over again and it is among the best I have ever heard in my life!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book loved the first 2 can't wait for them to release the other movies to see how they bring it to life
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good fun game. Wish you didn't  have to buy coins sometimes because the game should be linear but its OK. Lit of fun really really like
B009XY97VC|5.0|When I saw that Two Steps From Hell had a new album I didn't even hesitate on picking it up, their music is that enjoyable. That said though, this one is a little different from the previous releases and that might throw some people off. Give the samples a listen, or check them out on Pandora if you're unsure.
1401937519|5.0|I make a practice to read all of the most compelling books about near death experiences. This one is at the top of my favorites list because of the author's experiences growing up in a multi-cultural setting which resulted in an NDE that was not wrapped up in the trappings of religious teachings and dogma.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I loved all episodes of this, I loved the opening of every episode, there is nothing I don't like about this series!
B009JNXK88|5.0|I've had Android devices for the past 3 years and League of Evil is by far the most addicting game I've played. Its perfect for on the go gaming and worth far more than the 0.99 cent price tag. I can't say enough about how great this game is.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Depp makes the movie. Put a comedic face on a dull script. The story was a little weak. Special effect were good.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Wish it could be ten stars! After nearly driving into a tree dialing my phone it was time to go hands free. What a wonderful device. No hand held need, no dialing need with voice dialing. This is a gem at any price. Battery keeps charge for quite a while and is easily charged overnight when it goes out. My only complaint is the lights which tell you about such are very dim so it will be an unanswerable call before you know it. No biggee with a phone with voice auto but a minor problem. Love this thing.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Jones and Streep were excellent, their talent was wasted on a subpar script. Steve Carrell's role could have been performed by anyone, so his higher salary was wasted as well.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I don't have the actual album yet, but I have heard the album over and over again and it is among the best I have ever heard in my life!
B006S08RLU|5.0|I was feeling down and watched this again, such a lovely wonderful, playful movie. And beautiful music to boot!<br />Enjoy!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Plenty of special effects. Bale is not my favorite Batman. Too sullen. Not fun to watch. Hathway was a good Catwoman.
B00A993UWM|5.0|Her best album yet. More fun and keeps you moving until the end. Hope she does a concert tour soon as I'm sure it will be a smash with songs from this album!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|As a big fan of hidden object games this offered challenge without being impossible to play.  Well worth the three dollars. Looking forward to playing more games by big fish.<br />/
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an entertaining game to help pass the time if you're bored and sick of playing arcade games. kids like this one too.
B005LAII08|5.0|Yes there really is 5 discs. A light n dark fun movie. With some very funny scenes. The McGuffin was very funny.<br />Made Scotland look great.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Its lie watching a re-run. Not a good as the first two. Their scripts were better. Sprecial effects were good.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|love love love love love love love love love love love  love it one direction is the best ever 1d
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved the book.  The beginning was a little repetitive reflecting the first book but once read into it a little more definitely got better and better.  The ending stops abruptly, making you want to immediately read the third book.  There's some predictable parts but overall a page Turner.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  Big numbers makes it so easy to see and use. I just grab my Kindle when I reconcile my bank account.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This was like an average between the first and second one; I like the first one a lot and I can't remember the second.  It was worth renting from Amazon but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the movies.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting and authentic. Wonderful view of Om<br />Disappointed when it ended at 70 per cent and the rest was bibliography and supporting research. I would read it again and probably will.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|Fantastic running music!<br /><br />Adam does it again!<br /><br />Sooooooo good!<br /><br />I can't believe it!<br /><br />More words needed for this review to be legit!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|great games I just love mystery games only thing is could be a little less to pay for  the game and more free games like this which is free I mean the whole game
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down. Very like able characters and a plot that kept me wanting more
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because the main characters were too clean for people sneaking around in a city that was under martial law.  It would've appeared more realistic if they looked scruffier and unkempt; the police were trapped underground for long time and they were just too clean!
B004I744AS|4.0|Easy to use, full explanation. I like  it a lot, and it is free, haha.<br />So cool! If it can be used  without internet, it would be even better. Cuz not everywhere has WiFi after all.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I like the presentation of the calendar and the ease to move from month to month.  The presentation hightlights the schedule and also hightlights the task lists.<br /><br />The shortcoming that I see, is in the limited repetition options, especially if say, weekly repetitions have exceptions.  If you try to delete on of the weekly options, the entire list of repetitions is deleted.  Likewise, if you want to edit a  particular week in the repetition list, the entire list ends up with the edit posted.  I would like to see options like &#34;edit/delete this entry only&#34; or &#34;edit/delete this entry and all future entries&#34;. Making this change would give this calendar a 5 star rating.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was told that after the first book, the series would start to dull down. That wasn't the case. I absolutely loved The Hunger Games. I don't know how anyone could top it but Suzanne Collins did. My favorite book of all time.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is the first time I purchase a movie through amazon and I was a bit worried the box would be delivered damaged and what not. I thought this product was a steal and I hope my brother enjoys it.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|As a Vietnamese man, I am very offended by the level of racism presented towards the Vietnamese people in this musical. The character named Tony is constantly using racial epithets toward the characters named 黎憲宗 and 黎顯宗.<br />The scene where Charlie Sheen's character and his squad come into the village, murder everyone, and burn it down, is very offensive and frightening.
B004EKCNMA|2.0|Not sure I would have my children watch this. Seems it was creepier than the original. I am sure people really enjoyed the animation but I just didn't enjoy it.
B003XOAJ7E|5.0|I really love this album. The first half is packed with hits and songs that should have seen more airplay than they did. The second half of the album has some fantastic songs that did not have the mass-market commercial appeal, but musical gems nonetheless.<br />The bonus CD contains mostly remixes of the prominent songs from the album.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Very well thought-out and researched. Most of the tales were interesting with the exception of a few that were almost intolerably boring; but those with riveting stories probably were not... around... to share them?! And the tale about dachshunds being used for zombie recon brought a smile to my face!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Before purchasing the album, I made sure I listened to every song. I really love Lana Del Rey and I'm willing to buy a cd to support any artist that I like.
1423136802|5.0|I chose this rating cause my niece loves his books!<br />It wasn't to bad of a price either and I am very pleased with the order. And believe my niece will too!
B008MEM24S|5.0|my kids really liked this when we first got it, but after awhile found other things to amuse them.  they wanted this because the like the tv show phineas and ferb,  It is cute. and it worked well on the kindle fire
B000002L75|5.0|This is a fantastic album and any DM fan should have this in their collection. As with all DM albums, there are some songs that can be found on other albums. I bought a used copy to include in my &#34;digital format&#34; collection to replace my analog cassette. I originally bought the album back in the mid '80s;  and this album still has the magic feeling all these years later.<br /><br />I noticed that there is a remastered version available and in hindsight I would have opted for that since I am a bit of an audiophile. However, if you do not have a HiFi system the original CD is good quality for a normal system.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Loved this one and its a great Family movie~ the story line was a great one. Will watch this one over and over am sure of it.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I know I'm reviewing this season rather late, so most of you have probably already seen it, but there's a few things I need to say.<br /><br />Matt Smith, is simply put, the most fun Doctor since Tom Baker. I didn't expect much going in, as David Tennant was a fine Doctor (though his ending annoyed me to no end), but Smith takes his place with a fun charismatic performance. From the moment he shows up, he gives a sense of other worldness. His approach with young Amy Pond is delightful in that he's playing child psychiatry to keep her brave wonderfully.<br /><br />The season stands out to me as being one of the better ones in recent memory. We have the return of the Angels, which actually managed to make them even creepier. The running story line was interesting, and made me try to piece together not only what was going on, but how it could possibly end.<br /><br />My only complaints are that the collection did not include the Christmas Special, which was placed in series 6 instead. I also must say, series 5 is not quite as good as series 6, but as far as introductions go, Matt Smith has a great intro as the Doctor.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|This video seamlessly knits together the Bourne films with this twist in the storyline. I think they have given new life to the intrigue of covert operations and intelligence collection. Geopolitics are not articulated in the film, and as odd as that sounds, geopolitics are mot missed as the audience is kept focused on the compelling struggle to survive and remain faithful to honorable values while dastardly foes seek to brutally eliminate the heroes with extreme-prejudice. Thanks Amazon for making the video available so quickly.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My kids liked this and played with it until the star wars angry birds came out.  I found this to be harder than the original angry birds but my kids didn't have problems.  played well on the kindle fire.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|The production quality on this album is much better than the previous albums but the songs are less inspired. The bass is very strong. I first played this in the HiFi system in my car and found that it was just a little too much. I can't listen to more than 2 songs at volume before getting a headache. Many of the songs just have a droning sound that just goes on and on and lacks any significant hook to make it enjoyable. At this point, I will only listen to 3 of the songs and skip all of the others.<br /><br />I still think that the Discovery album is their best album and this was a disappointment artistically.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I've already watched it twice. The animation is amazing in this movie as well as the story line itself. I can see myself watching this on a f few times over.
B00AE2J93I|3.0|While cute, the plot tended to drag along. Additionally, I don't think the creative writers thought the whole plot scenario out very well. Where kids might find this fun and spooky (or whatever)--adults will be left scratching their heads. I expected more.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|I like watching this classic from time to time. My cousin served and died under General Patton in WWII. I have personally visited General Patton's grave in Luxembourg. It was a moving experience enhanced by witnessing Chinese tourists paying their respects to our American hero. The Chinese were transfixed by this movie when it was premiered throughout China. They have come at a rate of about 300,000 per year ever since to visit his grave. Amazing respect! The movie stitches together several well-known example vignettes from Patton's awesome combat record and uses the drama to describe the coalition politics and monumental struggle that was WWII. I cannot imagine not including this film in my library.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Awesome but work on the sounds. I got bored a little.<br />Music ,sound , and please infinite terrain.<br />Cool but make slendy a little bit more scary.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The images in this book are magical. I felt like I was at the circus in a red scarf! Worth the time!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best calculator I've ever used, and I've owned plenty of them over the years. Great app that I highly recommend. Not to mention it's hard to beat free!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you've played The Secret of Grisly Manor then you know what to expect. Game is really good and won't dissapoint.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As expected, this book kept me up late. I love Vince Flynn plots and, of course, Mitch Rapp is nothing but cool! Now just have to wait for his next novel.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is just what you expect, a fun adventure with the characters you love.  I really enjoyed reading this and I can't wait for the next one!
B002N9MK8G|5.0|Frank Sinatra at the Sands with Count Basie. How could this be anything but great. It is high quality sound and a wonderful selection of Sinatra songs.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This story reminded me of The Alchemist. It's a good book for all ages because it keeps the plot very simple. There isn't much moral complexity. It's just the story of one boys fantastic journey. If you're looking for an entertaining book that has some lessons and an interesting (but simple) plot line I say, go for it. It's a quick read.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The lack of subtitles (my hearing is shot) rendered a muddled script virtual unintelligible to me.  The disclaimer regarding subtitle availability by streaming device was buried deep in the fine print of the FAQs and disclosures.; I only looked when I realized subtitles were missing from my download.  Fortunately, I only wasted the promotional money given to me to join the service.  I will have to rent the DVD when it becomes available throughj Redbox.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I never tire of reading Grisham. No matter what subject, an unpainted house, a silly sports team, crime thriller or legal intrigue, John Grisham can't be beat.
B0000549B0|5.0|Out standiing movie... Atrue classis. I just saw it preformed on broadway. Thank you for leaving it black and white
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix Carol of the Bells is one of the best songs of the year!!!<br /><br />Yes their Christmas album is the best Christmas album of the year, hands down, but I take it a step further and say that their vocal styling can be enjoyed all year long.  I doubt any crummy boy band or overly sexualized woman can do what they do.  (The la-la-la breakdown at 2:18 of the song \\"Carol of Bells\\" is like musical honey to my ears - so sweet!!!)<br /><br />Please also check out their music video, its shot beautifully.<br />Pentatonix proves that vocal royalty still exists!!!<br /><br />I put my bet on them to win a grammy award!!!!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|classic John Grisham, involves you right into the plot with all its twists and turns -I would never have predicted the end.
B000JML90Y|5.0|I really can't say anything to improve on what's already been said about this publication. If you're familiar with this piece of media, it's very likely you already have an opinion on it. All I can say is that you should read this, and trust what your own reasoning processes will tell you about the validity of the evidence and the arguments presented herein. Good luck.
B00931JMRE|5.0|Another great album from that Little ol' Band from Texas! I like the new single and the style is a blend between Mescalero and old blues. Good stuff!
B000YABS8E|5.0|Thank you getting this movie to me very fast. I have enjoyed this movie the very first time i saw it.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|I like Neil Young and this MP3 download of the album came through with no issues and the audio quality is great.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|this guy works great! puts an edge on in just a few strokes through! small and compact yet feels sturdy! one of the better ones on the market
B004GVUPFE|3.0|Overall, I would just rate this game as \\"ok\\" and not something I am going to keep on my Kindle Fire - the puzzles can be challenging here and there, but it's really one of those mind-numbing things where you move a few Tetris-looking shapes around trying to get a certain shape into a certain area of the grid.<br /><br />The menu structure for this game is fairly non-existent once you start play.  If you are in the middle of the \\"novice\\" section as an example, and would like to move to a different challenging level, nothing really happens if you tap the \\"Menu\\" item on my 8.9\\" Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I picked this up for free as the free app of the day vs. it's normal price of $0.99 - for free, it's worth a shot, but save your buck once they start charging for it.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|If you like alot of action, alot of explosions, and kick ass action then the Expendables are for you. It's impressive that Arnold still has it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love it, no better way to ignore your husband and children. Makes watching the UFC bearable.  Only wish my employers browser didn't block it, Then I could make good use of their precious man hours really count.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Best writing, best acting, best casting, just the best darn show on television!  I'm so bummed that the next season (of 8 or 6 epis) is reported as the final one.
B008TSVZHM|5.0|Very handy way to keep track of my cards.  Has an area on the back to write a label to you can find the card you are looking for.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app does a limited job of showing you what's going on with your FB friends and family - compared to the Apple FB app on an iPad2 side-by-side, this version has a long way to go and is really in a pre-development phase.  There are quite a few ads in between every second or third of your friend's status updates that are highly annoying: does anyone really click on these?  I would recommend using this version of the app in a pinch, but that's about it.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|My product arrived almost a week and a half early. The description was accurate to the letter. Very pleased with my purchase.
B008458O3S|5.0|Kindle fire. This is definitely worth it.  It has a great variety of difficulties but is also a good mind bender. I got it for free but after playing I would definitely be willing to pay a couple bucks for it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It really doesn't get any better than this. Still waiting for them to turn it into a movie. Can't wait till season 3 part 2 comes back on in February.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This was an excellent program and a very good purchase. I was very pleased with the purchase...These were for my kindle fire.....
0316228532|5.0|What a book: a scathing roust that reveals the human failure that can be in all of us: As Walt Kelly has Pogo says to Porky Pine as they are surveying the destruction of the primeval forest on Earth Day: \\"Yep son, we have met the enemy and he is us.\\"  I would agree. This is a fantastic book written by a fantastic writer.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Well at the beginning I didn't think it would be very fun but then the levels became harder and I felt like I just HAD to get every puzzle perfect!!!!!!! I highly recommend this game.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Appropriately enough, all the Reacher's &#34;strive&#34; to be self contained.  Some are more boiler plate than others and this one is tending to become as formulaic as Reacher's pulp fiction predecessor Mac Bolan.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Very Good, exceeded my expectations. I will definetly buy this one for the wife's Disney collection. I would recommend to anyone with childred
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This was an excellent program and a very good purchase. I was very pleased with the purchase...These were for my kindle fire.....
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love movies, and if you like action movies, I would be in shock if you did not love this one. This is the first movie in years that I have wanted to watch over multiple times, have watched this no less than a dozen times. Can not wait for the sequel!!!!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|This is the only time I have ever played Mahjong so the game really impressed me. Although as you get farther into it I have noticed that it kind of gives me a headache so be aware of that. Over all this is a great way to pass free time and it is a great game.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Game of Thrones was one of my all time favorite series when it first issued, full of hope and promise in a unique world of (not so) courtly knights trumped by incestuous twins, dragons and shapeshifters.  Like Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time)  Martin's plotting skills are not up to his world building, and Book 5 is the worst kind of Anticlimax -- full of enough foreshadowing to make the fate of the few survivors predictable.  Kind of a core dump of unused backstory and long winded mico detail, wrapped around limited plot advancement which consists mainly of &#34;wrapping up&#34; loose ends by ending their existence.  Considering all that culminated in Book 4, this would be a good one to skip and see if Book 6 emerges, and if so, does better.
B00633W614|5.0|Couldn't wait to read this. Needed answers to the questions left open from 'Only time will tell'. Can't wait to read the third book.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|This was an excellent program and a very good purchase. I was very pleased with the purchase...These were for my kindle fire.....
B0054R6BFM|3.0|A friend of mine told me to read this book, after reading it, I have to say that I really don't care for it. I mean the book is a great and creative story, but the plot is good, its just not very well written. But it's not bad either..
0316056871|5.0|Tina Fey's &#34;Bossypants&#34; was one of the best autobiographies i have ever read. From the detailed descriptions of her triumphs and losses to the hilarious pictures I could not put this book down. So, if you want get judged on the subway for numerous outbursts of laughter or simply laughing alone in your empty house, this book is definitely for you.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The Intel Core series of processors has always been my preferred series to deal with (although I have two AMD based systems as of now). This processor is the perfect amount of power and performance for the money. Amazing for overclockers and gamers alike.<br /><br />Edit 3/28/13<br /><br />Was able to get this thing up to ~4.5GHz with the Noctua NH-D14 air cooler. Pretty impressive for air cooling and a non-extreme processor.<br />When paired with high end Asus Motherboards (I'm using the Sabertooth z77) these Intel processors are screaming fast.
0545265355|5.0|After seeing the movie I decided to read the books. I enjoyed the movie so I knew I would really enjoy these books. I could not put them down.....
B0063IH60K|4.0|This was an excellent program and a very good purchase. I was very pleased with the purchase...These were for my kindle fire.....
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My kids love this app. My 3yr. old can play this game for hours, and my 6yr. old likes it to. It is a little repetitive, but little kids like repetition. I'd like to see more animals and more ailments in the future, but for the free app of the day I can't complain. Very fun game for the kids.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|Enjoy it for what it is. It's just a fun action movie with all the 80's action stars having a good time. And I love the self-deprecating humor with the references to their old characters. Go in with the right expectations and enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book was wonderfully written to move at decent pace. But some of it felt like when she was describing a room or something else, like she was rushed. I wanted to be \\"inside\\" Ana's world. The other characters in the book didn't involve the reader very much. It was just Ana and Christian. Granted, it was her point of view but I was curious to learn more about her friend Kate and her boyfriend. And as other reviewers pointed out, a lot of the words were repetitive. It got to the point where I deliberately skip a paragraph she wrote the same thing a few pages before. It felt there was a time where maybe the author didn't know what else to write next so she repeated things just to fill out the pages.<br /><br />Overall, the book was a captivating subject and SOME of the sex scenes were riveting. It got me reading every chance I could to find out more about this Christian character, who the author kept a secret, but poking us with a stick - teasing with hints of what it could be or making us want to know. It's not full five stars because of some things I pointed out earlier.
6305428425|5.0|Didn't expect to like this movie. Thought it was a typical \\"dumb blonde\\" teenage comedy, but LOVED it. Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow are perfect as the ditsy blondes who reinvent themselves for their high school reunion. Seems like they're a great success until Janeane Garofalo broadcasts the truth. Will Romy and Michele always be the underdogs? Are they destined to go home in shame? This movie is more fun than Clueless or Dick and is a must-see for everyone who's attended a high school reunion--and even the ones who didn't. Plenty of laughs and a great ending!

B00A992W9Y|5.0|It's hard to describe why I enjoy Kesha so much. Superficially, her music seems appealing only to the lowest common denominator and far too self-indulgent to take seriously. However, a more thorough examination of her material will uncover an intelligently crafted blend of cynicism and tongue-in-cheek indulgence of decadence and the party scene.  This is what I love about her.<br /><br />With her debut album Animal, She poked fun at the stereotypes and clichés aimed at women in the music industry with a caricature of the woman that hip hop and pop artists defile with their derogatory, low-brow lyrics. Her songs were a statement of how she feels those women are viewed (nothing more than wild, dirty partiers).  Unfortunately, for most people this personification was construed as a reflection of her true character to the utmost degree and many were quick to dismiss her. I wasn't. I revere her as much as I revere Lady Gaga, it's just a shame she doesn't garner the same praise her contemporary does. Check out any interview or do a little bit of research and you learn Kesha is an incredibly bright, educated woman.<br /><br />So what do we get with this album? Warrior draws on the same formula that made Animal so successful. The talk rap, dance-electronic and auto-tuned beats which became her staple as an artist embody the music yet again but this time there's more of an analog, instrumental presence that gives the album an organic \\"oomf\\".  There are layers of drums and guitars effortlessly intertwined with a variety of synthetic melodies which separate the choruses from the verses and they do a wonderful job of distinguishing the decadent \\"I'm Partying\\" verses from the \\"You're Out Partying, I'm Alone And Missing You\\" choruses.<br /><br />What's cool about this album is the way Kesha divides her time between being serious and cynical. You can let your mind go with these songs, but when you're ready to take a look inside yourself and decipher the song meanings, you can dothat too and STILL enjoy the music. I found myself both enjoying these songs and relating to several others personally. If you're curious about the kind of variety she delves into, don't worry. There's plenty. The songs pulsate, they soar, they rock, and they beat hard. There are some Odes to past and present day pop rockers such as the strokes in songs like \\"I Only Wanna Dance With You\\", Joan Jett in \\"Gold Trans Am\\", 80s Metal in the Album art, Lady Gaga's Grandeur in \\"Supernatural\\", a little bit of the White Stripes' simplicity in \\"Thinking Of You\\", The reminiscent nature of the Ataris and Don Henley in \\"Wherever You Are\\" and just about any other wonderful rock/pop combination you can dream up.<br /><br />The album remains consistent enough to hold my attention and offers the right amount of variety to keep me interested later on. Kesha has done the pop world a glorious service with this album, which is remaining persistent and dedicated to her direction. With Warrior, she scoffs the critics and veers her Gold Trans Am through night blaring tunes from this awesome, brazenly executed follow up to Animal. Put your dancin' shoes on and get ready for some fun!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Held back by a slow start, this movie begins to work its way into your heart. There have been male leads that have been excessively grumpy in a lot of movies, but few who showed the intensity of feeling here. Although I am not a 65 year old woman who becomes a groupie, Richard Armitage came as close as any man has ever done. In this movie, he did ALL his acting with his eyes and a tightly held knowledge that he was not whom he appeared. Under that harsh exterior beat the heart of a man deeply in love with no way of knowing how to show it. Daniela Denby-Ashe, who played a very loving and caring character, did an exceptional job of not quite knowing how to feel about him. Armitage's mother could have been any movie's nasty step-mother except little snatches kept showing through that showed she was actually doing what she thought was best for her son and to save their struggling business. I am a devotee of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. If you love that, add this to your collection. You will not regret it.
0385536828|5.0|Saturday was one of the best novels about the post 9/11 world.  I think this novel tops it.  While the subject is a bit retro, the strength of the characters and precision prose overcomes it.  The female protagonist is so well drawn it's frightening... even better than his rendering in Atonement.

0525952926|4.0|This book depressed me.  It was WWII yes.  People died, yes.  But they did in Fall of Giants as well.  This is well written and intertwines all the lives in good page turner, but it still just sort of.....depressed me.  I will buy the third in the Trilogy of course (some books I Kindle, others I HAVE to have the first editions and this is one of them) and I hope the end of the Trilogy is a little more upbeat, and I like the characters more.  Maybe that's it - I just don't love the evolution of the characters from the first book.<br /><br />I knew of course this couldn't exactly be a happy book, but so far the Trilogy isn't up there with Pillars of the Earth or World without End.  Here's for a great 3rd book.

B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I give it a three because although it had something fresh like a  Valentine's dance rather than a random three months of Greg's life. It could've focused more on the point of the story (the dance) that aspect of the story did not come into focus until around page 120 130 maybe as early as 90. (I'll have to go back and check) In conclusion rather than buying this book go to your local library and rent it, or read it there.

B00A6PD9I4|2.0|Rip off of a few moments from Disney's Robin Hood.  BORING, no comedy - poorly executed.  Possibly the worst Pixar movie ever made.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|As a fan of the last 2 Batman movies, I was expecting the Dark Knight Rises to be action packed and exciting as the previous 2.  Boy was I wrong.  The Dark Knight rises is boring and way too long.  It's at least an hour too long.  Most of the movie has no action and I almost turned it off I was so bored.  I was originally sad to hear that Nolan wouldn't be back to direct a 4th Batman movie.  After seeing this one, I am now glad this is the end.<br /><br />If you want to see a good Batman movie, go watch Batman Begins or The Dark Knight.  Skip this one unless you want to take a nap.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Good story connected enough to current events and urban myth to keep it moving. Ends in the right place instead of six pages too long.
0156027321|1.0|Well!  I just finished reading Life of Pi (Kindle Edition).  I chose to read the book because there is a movie just released and wanted some background before deciding whether I wanted to see the movie.  Based on the (most helpful) reviews, I purchased the book and dug in.<br /><br />\\"Fantasy,\\" \\"allegory,\\" \\"parable\\" -- all promised a good reading experience.  And I admit, the first part of the book, before the shipwreck, was WONDERFUL.  I really enjoyed the process that young Pi endured in his self seeking.  And I loved the writing style.  Great promise for the shipwreck and challenges I knew were to come.  However, for me, the whole thing fell apart with the shipwreck.  The book became a descent in gratuitous violence and gore.  But I still could buy into it as a \\"coming of age\\" adventure.  Then the author dumps in the algae, which didn't fit with the narrative and made no sense in context - delirium maybe?  But the final straw was the last part, where the author totally wimped out on his premise.  Since I put the book down yesterday, I have been trying to figure out why he did that. The ending negatived everything that had gone before and was totally unsatisfying.  I wish the author had had the courage to follow through with the set-up he created at the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />As to what to do about the movie -- I cannot image how this book could be made into a film.  How would it capture all the wonder from part 1? Being true to the violence from part 2 would certainly make me skip it.  Bad enough imagining it.

B0079XPUOW|4.0|I thought it was going to be a Star Trek spoof.  Of course it is, but it turns out that's what the book is about.  It's about the fact that the characters are living in a Star Trek Spoof and what they are going to do about it.  I thought it was just going to be a Star Trek like world where people learn the rules and use that knowledge to their benefit.  I don't know if that difference is clear.  I DO like this novel though. I've enjoyed this author in the past and I found this book lighthearted and fun.  A good read.

B003T0G9XU|5.0|I have stumbled upon his books in the library a few years back, and since then me and my teenage son have read almost all his books between the two of us. We can \\"fight\\" for hours about which one is better.<br />I have read some of the reviews, and I can agree with most. Some of the books grab you by the short hair the first time you read it, some take a second reading, some will not be your favourite. One thing is very clear though, all of Mr Pratchett's books are a brilliant masterpiece in itself. He has such a vivid imagination and such a fine sense of humour.<br />I have read the previous Tiffany-books, and I am so happy that this one has such a good ending. Everything ties in nicely in the end, all the evil are, for the time being, fought off. Marriages, funerals, the ever-present Nac Mac Feegles, fun and fear, fight and flight, you will find a bit of everything in this one. He balances the dark and the funny perfectly. I might add that my son does not like the Tiffany series, maybe because it is about a girl? I loved them all. I love ALL his books, although some a bit more than the others.<br />Although his books are a bit expensive, it really is worth your while to read at least 10 Terry Pratchett books in your lifetime. Your education will not be complete if you don't.

0670023329|5.0|There are stories that can change you. This is one of them.<br /><br />I don't know how much the average American knows about North Korea. I knew it was a totalitarian government, but was completely ignorant of the degree of darkness that covers its people. Camp 14 illustrates a system that methodically destroys a human, physically as well as spiritually. It is George Orwell's 1984. And it's happening today.<br /><br />Shin's escape is nothing short of remarkable. The suffering he endured is unconscionable. He did not go to hell, he was born there. He endured 23 years there. And, yet, despite all dire odds, he stands as reminder of the human spirit; that a person can survive, can rise from the ashes of the most heinous conditions, and become human again.<br /><br />Shin has something to teach us about suffering. I found myself naively thinking that after experiencing hell to that degree, his life outside Camp 14 would be bliss. And yet he eventually struggles with everyday life like many of us do. Shin illustrates that freedom -- true freedom -- is not an entitlement, not a guarantee, but something we must work to understand and preserve.<br /><br />Thank you, Shin.

B000FMGTTE|5.0|When I first heard that they were going to make a new Superman film, my first thought was \\"I hope they don't screw it up!\\" I am a huge fan of not only Superman, who is my favorite Superhero, but also of the original Christopher Reeves Superman, which I feel is the BEST interpretation of that character ever done. Additionally I am a RABID fan of the John Williams score and continue listening to it regularly to this day as well as being a filmscore afficionado (see my \\"screen name\\"!). Well, as soon as I saw the film \\"Superman Returns\\" I was THRILLED! Director Bryan Singer and company, who are also huge fans of the original film, PURPOSELY went out of their way to maintain the same feeling and flavor of that film in \\"Superman Returns\\", from the actor who portrays Superman/Clark Kent to AMAZING effect, even looking, sounding and moving like Christopher Reeves, to using an amazingly realistic digital \\"ghost\\" of the late Marlon Brando's \\"Jor-El\\" character! So how could ANYONE not understand WHY Director Singer and Composer John Ottman would utilize the incredible John Williams themes he wrote for the original films?! I read a review by an Amazon.com reviewer named Elisabeth Vincentelli which bashes Ottman for this choice. Well, Ms. Vincentelli CLEARLY doesn't understand either the purpose of the Director and Composer to stay true to the feeling of the original film or for that matter that the \\"Superman March\\" theme composed by John Williams has become and IS part of the Superman character now! It is as much a part of the character as the red and yellow \\"S\\" on the chest of his suit! In other words, I couldn't disagree with the sentiment expressed by Ms. Vincentelli MORE! John Ottman does an AMAZING job utilizing the John Williams themes while incorporating his own compositions into the score! Ottman knows just WHERE to use those themes and there are places where his love of them really comes through, such as the choral voices which accentuate the dramatic flourishes of the\\"Superman March\\" in some areas of the score, such as in the track \\"Saving The World\\", which gives me chills of excitement! His own original compositions are melodic and beautiful and powerful, especially the \\"secondary\\" theme he wrote for the Superman character which is best utilized in the tracks \\"So Long Superman\\" and \\"Little Secrets/Power of the Sun\\". Ottman has a complete grasp of Williams' score and no one could have done a better job in incorporating it into his own music for \\"Superman Returns\\". This was a HIGHLY underrated film which was INFINITELY better than it was given credit for and so is its score! As I said, I am a HUGE Superman fan, a huge fan of the Williams Superman theme, it IS part of the character of Superman and I think that anyone making a Superman film in the future would be FOOLS if they REMOVED that theme from the Superman character in their film. In fact, I wouldn't want to SEE a Superman film which DIDN'T have it in its score and at the time of this writing there IS a new Superman film in the works...we will see! As a last bit of advice, beware of ANYONE who claims to be an \\"expert\\" music critic, there's NO SUCH THING! My HIGHEST recommendations for the score to \\"Superman Returns\\" and Kudos to Composer John Ottman! Long Live Superman!

B000031WBV|5.0|This pair of discs contains the 19 nocturnes recorded by Rubinstein between 1965-7. This is slightly fewer than the complete 21 recorded by Ashkenazy or Pires for example and the two missing nocturnes may be regretted by some collectors.<br /><br />Rubinstein's recordings of Chopin, made over a lifetime and re-visited more than once, were important landmark recordings for many listeners and these became, and remain, definitive recordings for a lot of people. They have a very distinctive style and sound which makes them instantly recognisable but not beyond compare. The very distinctive nature of the recordings underlines the fact that no-one else played them that way then or that way today. Unless it is accepted that it is possible that any one artist can have an absolute monopoly over an interpretation or an interpretive approach (a very questionable view), then it must be accepted that there must be other equally valid ways of interpreting any music, which in the hands of an equally fine musician must inevitably be an equally fine, if different, listening experience.<br /><br />These particular recordings of the nocturnes are notable for their emotional restraint. Rubinstein plays it as it is, or rather as he sees it as it is. Some have described his playing as like presenting the notes like small gems or jewels for us to admire and enjoy. Others have described his playing as aristocratic and others as autocratic. All of these descriptions have some truth about them. Rubinstein also used his own piano wherever he went. This was because it had been specially prepared to suit his particular way of playing. It had an especially light action requiring a very light touch. This would be ideal for the smaller, more intimate venues and not so suitable for larger halls where more projection is clearly required.<br /><br />This simple instrumental consideration brings about one of the differences between Rubinstein and Ashkenazy for example. Rubinstein's approach is more intimate, more private, more identifiable with a salon environment. Ashkenazy's approach is less intimate, more public, bigger boned and more identifiable with a larger hall environment. Pires offers a gentler touch but also noticeably warmer than either in her survey. She is not as large scaled, even as masculine as Ashkenazy, but is more intimate, more feminine and more emotionally engaging than Rubinstein. All three of these pianists, and many others of course, are considered very fine on the world stage and I would suggest that they all have a place and something equally valuable to add to our understanding of Chopin.<br /><br />Finally one must consider the actual sound quality of the recording. The one that is given to Rubinstein is closely miked within rather a dry acoustic. This robs the piano of the tonal depth that more recent recordings have. This, over the years, has become identified as part of the Rubinstein sound. This is not strictly true of course. What we are hearing is Rubinstein's sound through the medium of the recording studio, the engineer's choice of acoustics and balance plus technical equipment. In many ways this seems to fit in with Rubinstein's more intimate approach but it is not his sound as we would hear it in a 'live' situation today.<br /><br />This set of nocturnes, with all that has been described above, remains a benchmark set of performances given by a unique musician with his own unique way of expressing his view of Chopin. It is not cluttered with extra emotion or exaggeration as regards tempo or dynamics and is greatly to be preferred to more indulgent performances. It requires compromises and understanding to be made considering the actual recorded sound which in turn affects the way Rubinstein's view of Chopin reaches us.<br /><br />In summary, I would suggest that this is essential listening for any serious collector but that it does not have a complete monopoly over interpretation. I prefer to own this as one of many recordings. It is a safe recommendation as an 'only' purchase but not the only one to be considered as an 'only' buy. There are other, equally valid alternatives which offer different approaches and which will suit different listeners for those different ways. I have used just two contrasting alternatives in the course of this review to indicate what those alternative considerations may include.<br /><br />Further Note: The 10 disc box set published in 2010 with 24 bit remastering of the whole collection offers a significant improvement on sound in every way on all discs. This can be confidently stated as I own both and have been able to do an A/B comparison. That box set must now be the best possible purchase.ngs.

B004X4R49Y|5.0|Absolutely, positively brilliant!!! Everyone should see this movie. My only complaint would be it was over too soon. See it!
B00540G3G6|5.0|Its an awesome movie to watch with a bluray... after seeing the characters at disneyworld.. we had to get it..
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading another good story by Stephen King. This was first rate and very well thought out. I loved how the characters from &#34;IT&#34; were brought into the story. Thanks for the chuckles.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This is a good movie, a classic to add to your collection. A Good qaulity film, Little C is a great actor.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't get enough of this show. Best to watch online so you can have a marathon. It's impossible to stop once you start.
144234900X|5.0|The hubbie and I enjoy all of Kathy Reichs audio books while traveling.  Gives us food for thought and discussion.
B000YPWDSS|5.0|I agree with the \\"This Version Is A Lot Easier On Your Ears\\" Reviewer.<br />Althought it took a little while for this Import CD to show up (hey, it was shipped from Brazil!), it was instantly apparent on the first spin that the Import is a smoother, yet somehow more robust mix than the standard U.S. Version.<br />If you're an Amy fan, you owe it to yourself to have this - Buy it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love this guy's writing and this is a particularly good one in the Mitch Rapp series.  Buy and read this one NOW.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Well done. We really enjoyed this film, in spite of the rather obtuse plot. Lots of fun, and without the usual reliance on adolescent sexual innuendo, sometimes confused with actual humor (see SNL), so pervasive in media today. There are a couple of scenes that really are somewhat inappropriate, as they portray children in sexual situations, but they are pretty mild. All in all, though, pretty funny and full of surprises. Few films surprise me these days, so it was a nice departure.
B00992CF6W|5.0|buy it.I'm a 9 year old boy and this is the best game in my life. GET ITNOW.I just gave it 5 stars but it wouldint let me put ten.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun! Hours of fun, very addicting game! I have this game on my phone and kindle fire HD!
B00A2XU9IS|4.0|Day seven and eight are exactly the same. I expect more out of an app I have to pay for.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|We enjoyed this film. The special effects were great, the characters were well developed, the plot was fun, and the acting pretty good. The typical Hollywood sexual deviance was absent, so the film is great for families.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|My words cannot begin to describe how lovely this book was.  This book was meaningful on so many levels.  So often when I read romance novels, it is the same stories spun a little differently, with the same cliches over and over.  Nothing about this story was cliche, and I never wanted to skip a page, much less miss a word of what was happening in the story.  The plot was highly intriguing but my favorite thing about the book was the depth of the characters.  I am in awe of the author's ability to create characters that are flawed, human, and real.  I loved how the various characters stories are woven together with the themes of family, loyalty, betrayal, heartbreak, privilege, and poverty.  It was amazing. No contrivances or annoying plot devices.  It was a beautiful story and I can't wait for Lydia's novella!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Love most of their songs but some more than others - but after listening to many of them, I end up LOVING them... So, almost all of their music is good... Some makes me sad, some are uplifting, some make me want to stomp my feet and jump around and just be happy to be ALIVE yo!!  Not sure which of their two albums I like better... Recommend you get both and listen and enjoy and stomp your feet from time 2 time yo!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham. I was more than halfway through this book when I could see where it was going. Fascinating chain of events to follow.
B001NVIZ3E|4.0|My 12-year old daughter and I really enjoy watching the oldies. They're clean and safe and you don't need to worry about sleaze slipping in where it's not expected. A typical Flynn swashbuckler -- anybody who's seen Errol Flynn in films knows exactly what to expect -- and something a kid should see growing up as reflective of what Hollywood once was like (at least on celluloid).
B000TEMRO4|5.0|I'd only heard one Blondie song before I bought this album, but I have to say, I've found a new favorite CD!  There's something truly magical about this music.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love most of their songs but some more than others - but after listening to many of them, I end up LOVING them... So, almost all of their music is good... Some makes me sad, some are uplifting, some make me want to stomp my feet and jump around and just be happy to be ALIVE yo!!
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Teaches you the basics of negotiation with excellent and memorable examples. I wish everyone would read this book - it helps in all kinds of situations and I feel it's a global problem. The main messages are to put yourself in the other persons shoes, not argue over a position (it's easy to stake your pride in a position you may not believe in as the discussion ensues) but rather over a problem and solution, and not thinking of the problem as one dimensionally (even in negotiating a price, there are always ton of other variables - like over how long it's paid, or in cash or credit, if you'll come back or what you'll do with the purchase etc. etc.).
B009KHDT0C|1.0|We knew when we rented this show it really had nothing in common with the original Dark Shadows, of which we are great fans. In fact, it really had nothing in common but the name. Burton's character development was very poor and the show really amounted to a slapstick version of what was really a serious show. A pity for Depp -- at times he can be a great actor. I pretty much knew all this from watching the trailers, but my family wanted to see it so I caved in and watched it. None of the actors bear any relationship to the original characters.<br /><br />Really a shame, IMHO. The original series is ripe for a retro movie and it could be done really well by a competent team of producers. One star for me.
B004U52VPS|5.0|My 4 year old is obsessed with Angry Birds so we bought this and one other set and he plays with them non stop. The sling shots work great and has held up to his play. The figures are a good size and very realistic. It comes with cards that show you different ways to set up the blocks. He has fun building all the set ups and knocking them down. I highly recommend these sets!!!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Arthur Christmas was a delight, with a sweet message that Christmas is about every single child in the world, we loved this movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so awesome. I love how the dragons change when they evolve. again, I love this game. From- A DragonVale lover
B009NQKPUW|3.0|The film began well and the plot looked promising. There was some foul language that really didn't need to be there. Hollywood, why do you always assume that filthy language adds something to a film? Halfway into the film, however, it became apparent that is was simply a remake of the Alien films. That's all good and fine, but the film lost the original mystique of the premise implied by the opening of the plot. It was pretty well done, but there were also some pretty unbelievable scenes as well. Could have been better had they developed the concept alluded to at the beginning.
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven provides a much needed perspective that has important implications for life now.  In terms of the account itself, the marks of the miraculous are present from beginning to end.  It is particularly astounding that Dr. Alexander had a full recovery.  As far as I know, denial of the miraculous nature of his full recovery requires a prior assumption that miracles cannot occur.<br /><br />If our current earthly life is the only life, then there is little reason to hope for a better future when permanently life-changing events occur or for those who never had a chance in the first place.  If heaven is vastly superior to life on earth and a place where people can engage life with their Creator doing exactly what they were created to do, then there is no reason to lose hope when our earthly plans seem to have failed. N.T. Wright provides excellent insights on heavenly hope in Surprised by Hope and other works.<br /><br />Heavenly hope helps us make better decisions than we would without it.  Heavenly hope may be the difference between reacting in desperation or waiting out a fierce storm for a better day.  The hope of heaven can enlighten decisions now and keep us from reacting in destructive ways to disappointments.<br /><br />The non-Christian terminology used in the book may have been chosen to reach a non-Christian audience but the miracles themselves reflect the pattern of the Bible.
030758836X|2.0|Where is the hype from this book coming from?  It is very slow to start and several of my friends just gave up on it.  I have kept plodding on until the end and, I must say, the end is riveting.  But you have to endure through half of the book to get there!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I like this a lot use it almost every day this thang rocks. and it is free best app every
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I bought this based on the reviews. I purchased this for my Nikon d7000 with the standard lens. Thanks amazon it came quickly. The instructions are a 1 pager. Doesn't show anything on calibrating or balancing the device. I bought it with the quick release but that adds more complexity to the on going balancing act. I have yet to be able to use it. I spent hours and hours trying to get to balance so I could do a simple Dolly or pan. Do not get this product you will be displeased.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Meryl Streep just keeps doing what she does so well. Here is a story of a marriage gone cold and both Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones create characters so real and believable you feel you know exactly what they are feeling, what they are going through and the roller coaster ride of their lives as they stumble through the wall of non-communication. I can't hold back, I thoroughly enjoyed this one.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I recommend this series to all who love fairy tale type stories. This series wraps them all into one and then some!

1603427244|5.0|Just putting in my two cents - I love this book! Casting on and binding off are very important steps in any project, and this book provides explanations and instructions so you can choose the best cast on/bind off for what you are knitting. There are clear pictures and examples of each method, as well as helpful characteristics of which to be aware. This book provides an ample selection of methods without being overwhelming, is spiral bound for ease of use, and small enough to fit in your knitting bag for mobility. I love it!

0060589280|5.0|Paulo Coehlo is the only male author I know of who can pull off writing about sexuality from a woman's perspective - almost as good as if he was actually a woman himself.<br /><br />In case you were wondering, the title \\"11 Minutes\\" came from the statistical average amount of time that most people in the world spend having sex. The novel is about much more than sex, however; it's about a girl's dream, her immense sacrifices in hopes of a better life, and how she finds love by tapping into her innate power as a woman, which had been lying dormant inside of her for far too long. The inspiration for this engrossing tale came from Paulo's conversations with real prostitutes who opened up their hearts to him, and he compiled those true tales into one captivating story.<br /><br />Maria was a beautiful Brazilian girl who longed to escape from her hometown and find fame in the world; she thought her chance had finally come when her \\"talent\\" was recognized by a foreigner who offered her a job as a dancer in Europe. She innocently believed that it would be an easy job and eagerly accepted the plane ticket to a new future. She then finds herself in a cold, uncaring country having to learn new languages and ways of behavior to get by. Struggling to make enough money to pay the bills in a corrupt business, prostitution seemed like the only practical way for her to survive. She just wanted enough money to be able to return back home without looking like a failure, and she prayed that she could endure whatever it took to reach her goal.<br /><br />The writing is poignant, heartfelt, and so real that you feel you actually ARE this girl as you read it. The story seems so familiar that anyone can instantly connect to it. We see Maria as a young girl with her first crushes and natural curiosity about the unmentionable topics of sex, masturbation and how women orgasm. She is unfulfilled in the bedroom, primarily out of innocent ignorance. As she becomes a prostitute, sex is never enjoyable for her but becomes a chore that she has desensitized herself too... always pretending to orgasm with clients without ever experiencing real pleasure.<br /><br />When one client suddenly doesn't want sex and only wants to listen to HER instead, Maria begins to see herself in a way that she had never imagined. In this eye-opening, honest story of her personal transformation, the heroine discovers that in order to find her most powerful erogenous zone, she must first open her own, sacred heart.<br />  -Joy Sydney Williams (author)yable for her but becomes a chore that she has desensitized herself too... always pretending to orgasm with clients without ever experiencing real pleasure.<br /><br />When one client suddenly doesn't want sex and only wants to listen to HER instead, Maria begins to see herself in a way that she had never imagined.

B004UIOUHC|2.0|I was looking for an alternative browser for an older Android 2.2 tablet, but Opera didn't seem to work well for me.  Some webpages appeared too fine print, like trying to squeeze a desktop version of Hotmail, for example, on my 7&#34; Sylvania.  Amazon does not offer Mobile Mozilla Firefox (only available through Google Play), which my Sylvania cannot access...which is way I tried Opera.  At least the stock browser (which is Google Chrome-based) downloads Hotmail and other sites in their mobile/tablet versions.  Opera doesn't.

B00007KWHP|5.0|`Fragile' was released in the UK in November 1971, with release in the USA delayed by 2 months in order not to inhibit sales of `The Yes Album' which was still selling well in America after a slow start. It's the band's fourth studio album, the first to feature Rick Wakeman on his battery of keyboards, replacing Tony Kaye who departed midway through rehearsing the `Fragile' material. `Fragile' was also the first Yes album to employ the striking stylistic cover-artwork of Roger Dean, and is considered by many fans to be the greatest Yes collection of all. It's a personal favourite of mine, a played-almost-to-destruction 1971 vinyl copy bought as a young teenager having been in my collection for 40 years.<br /><br />The album pivots around three long tracks, opening with Yes' all-time best-known number `Roundabout'. `South Side of the Sky' at 7.58 & `Heart of the Sunrise' at 11.32 are musically sophisticated tours-de-force, demonstrating the band's developing musical & compositional skills to great effect. A shorter track, the single-length `Long Distance Runaround' completes the set of numbers by the whole band. In between, each of the five offer a solo composition, the most interesting Chris Squire's `The Fish' followed by Jon Anderson's multi-tracked rhythmic vocal `We have Heaven' & Steve Howe's solo classical guitar piece `Mood for a Day.'<br /><br />`Fragile' takes the distinctive style beginning to emerge on its predecessor `The Yes Album' to a new level. The compositions are more complex, the playing even tighter, the soundscape more expansive, the whole feel of the album more - well, awesome would not be an overstatement. Wakeman fits right in and brings a lot to the party, though contractual problems between A&M and Atlantic meant he couldn't be formally credited as composer of any of the material. Anderson's bizarre song lyrics, imaginative & full of poetic imagery, are an essential ingredient to the distinctive character of the music and part of the `Yes style.'<br /><br />On the `expanded & remastered' version of `Fragile' you get, as a bonus, the storming 10.33 version of `America', never on the original album. You also get an early rough mix of `Roundabout' which, whilst not overshadowing the version chosen for the original album release, is interesting nevertheless. The sound mix is exemplary.<br /><br />Roger Dean's very distinctive cover-art is reproduced in full, plus the 16-page photos-&-words insert which, on the original vinyl release, was stapled into the gatefold. Here the text is expanded to include an essay by Bill Martin on this period in Yes' career.<br /><br />This is the best-so-far version of one of the best albums from the 1970s era, recommended unreservedly to all genuine music fans including younger aficionados interested in getting to know more about the great British prog movement of the 1970s.tyle.'<br /><br />On the `expanded & remastered' version of `Fragile' you get, as a bonus, the storming 10.33 version of `America', never on the original album.

B008B8A9V8|2.0|got this book from the library and really liked it.  thought I would buy the kindle version so I could always have it with me.  Hate it.  pictures are small and when you enlarge they are NOT crisp and NOT sharp.  the way the content is organized in the kindle version just takes away all that I found well done in the print version.
B008N1V11U|1.0|deleted everything on my kindle fire. still says I don't have enough room for it. seriously...wazzup???  looked likeit would be great. guess I'll never know.

B00AA7O6QC|3.0|A pleaseant and entertaining way to spend 90 minutes for fans for Sylvester Stalone, with the added bonus of Bruce Willis, Chuck Norris, Jet Li and a host of other recognizable action adventure stars doing just what you would expect them to.  I hope they will make another one including Wesley Snipes when he gets out of jail.
B003QCCS36|5.0|One of my favorite albums. Ray has such soul and passion it exudes from every note on this album. Fan for life
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is done beautifully.  It lives up to the quality of the book!  Definitely recommend watching it.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I laughed a lot, out loud.  I love the supporting cast! They really stood out in my mind. No surprise that my favorites now have their own tv shows.  I also love Natalie Portman. I can watch this over and over.
B009HELT3C|3.0|A pleasant and worthwhile way to spend 90 minutes for MIB fans with an especially ironic twist for Will Smith's character.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I bought this for my wife - she loves it.  Great tunes and easy listening.  Sale price makes it an even better deal!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This story is definitely a fairytale.  Connor was not believable at all.  Where on this earth could you marry a guy that was so attentive but yet so distant. Never argued or became angry.  A man like that doesn't exist. I guess it could happen, waking up married in Vegas.  If I woke up married and didn't remember a thing...boy would I get out of there as fast as I could.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.  Connor a rich businessman wants a relationship without someone loving him.  Meghan wants a baby without a husband.  Both have neglectful/non loving parents, which is why Connor doesn't want anyone to love him. Meghan doesn't want a husband for fear he would leave her.  Just like all the husbands that left her mother. So she does all these things to upset Connor so he'll leave. Can't figure that one out. Connor was too manipulative, he wanted what he wanted, when he wanted it and how he wanted it. He wanted a wife of convenience. It was too detailed almost boring in the beginning when all they did was talk about the \\"arrangement\\".  Even the sex between them was boring..not enough detail or passion. The happily ever after ending is predictable.  (Doesn't this remind you of that movie with Cameron Diaz and Aston Kutcher \\"What Happens In Vegas\\".) It wasn't a bad story but it wasn't a great story either.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Had a couple of glitches but the game is great!  One of the best I have played.  Worth every penny!  So, buy it!!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|This is a worthy start to the Alien series, but it does not answer all of the questions, for instance how does the Alien vessel wind up crashed on the planet where it was found in the original Alien movie and why do the creators of the Alien monster want to destroy mankind.  I eagerly await the next prequel.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is a nice way to pass the time. If you like farm vile or other games like that you'll enjoy this one.
B000002AGE|4.0|Really like '70s jazz & Weather Report is one of the better, up there with Chick Corea. This is proberly yheir 2nd best album after 8:30.
B000001EIA|5.0|In the era of Grunge in 1995 Kiss appearing on Mtv Unplugged was a nice surprise .people have always made fun of hard rock and metal musicians but as music fans know they had a lot more talent than almost anything on the radio today.of all the Kiss albums i have this one is one of my favorites. Kiss unplugged is one of the best shows of the Mtv Unplugged series .the singing and song selection was great and the band is tight the whole show .these acoustic versions of the songs are better than some of the orginal songs on the Kiss studio albums. this show proves that Kiss is more than just the makeup and stage show.Kiss has great melodies in there catalog and boasts three very good singers who all sing well on this show Paul Stanley is the best of the three on this show Gene also sounds great .highlights for me include Sure Know Something great harmony singing See You Tonight From Gene's solo album ,Beth in an acoustic version better than the single version Peter is great on this song. other songs I Still Love You and Everytime I Think Of You have great vocals from Paul Stanley.if your just getting into Kiss I would highly reccommed this album and there first 4 studio albums. I give this album a 5 rating
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book. Very suspenseful and keeps you hanging on every word. Make sure you have some time to spare when you purchase this...you won't want to put it down!

B009JBZH54|5.0|Saw them at the theaters and have shared them with my Grandchildren.  We are watching these again when my Grandson comes home from college at Christmas!
B008FTAAG2|3.0|I have been a fan of In This Moment since i discovered them on a hard rock metal station back in 2007 when the first album Beautiful Tragedy came out and this album to me is not even close to there best. Maria Brink has a good voice she sounds like a Debbie Harry of Blondie or early Pat Benatar which is a good thing besides her playboy bunny good looks which is all the press talks about in magazines.the band was also very good except now that there is only Maria and the guitarist left. there are a few very good songs that make the album worth buying and a lot of filler. From The Ashes is the best melodie and catchy chorus and Scarlet is also a good poppy song ,a lot of the songs are mostly screaming not singing which i am not a fan of.I bought the album cause i am a longtime fan if your not a big In This Moment fan then buy the first album which is there best record the second album and then this album. this album gets 3 stars for the good songs!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read this series to see what all the fuss was about. I was entertained at times but felt like I had to force myself to just get through some of it. The Sylvia Day Crossfire novels were much better in my opinion!

034580404X|5.0|Love it.  Can't put it down once I start reading.  would read it again if need be.  Would have downloaded onto Kindle had I know it was going to be this good.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|I was expecting so much more from this movie. The story line could have gone very deep, and the character of the advanced &#34;engineer&#34; could have been built up showing us more about our DNA ancestry.
B007EECSFA|3.0|This was an interesting story with surprising twists and turns.  My only complaint was much of the dialogue and interaction between the sisters and family was extraneous and felt more like filler.  The main focus of the story is the now elderly and dying mother's early history.  They added nothing to the story or plot, and this made their time on the page rather tedious.
0525952926|4.0|Well done with the new characters while still see the originals characters. You love some and hate some but the book keeps you interested the whole time

B008FTAAG2|5.0|One of the better heavy metal bands I have heard in a long time. This babe has an awesome voice and the music is bad ass.
B003ZLV8T8|5.0|Both the video and sound quality were excellent.  I highly recommend movie purchases from Amazon.com - they are always top quality.
B005URRCUY|4.0|Great album all around. Not many you can sit and .listen to the whole thing this one you can. great work
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved it... Grisham never lets u down, wish he put out more books but appreciate that when he does they are great quality reads.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Excellent read. Well written. I recommend this book for those who are true patriots and appreciate those who sacrifice for our freedom.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|this was a simple transaction handled perfectly.  the reason I needed a new cable was odd.  the original cable covering had completely disintegrated.  I wonder if the material used was defective although the cable had been stored at a vacation home close to the sea.  It was in a plastic bag in a drawer inside the house.  I dont think plastic should disintegrate under such circumstances.  I didnt bother to contact Amazon about this product issue...it just wasnt worth the time.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Chemistry of the characters in Bones is amazing. It keeps getting more interesting as the seasons progress. Love this show
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I could not figure out how to change the setting to not being charged for adding things to the game. My Granddaughter is three and obviously cannot play a game that costs money to play.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book. I recommend this book for those who are true patriots and appreciate those who sacrifice for our freedom.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|This book is not usually my style of book but it is pretty awesome ^_^ It kept me interested throughout and made me want to find out more! The writing can be a little confusing because it goes back and forth a little, but still a great read.
B00181JGI2|4.0|Strong performances, and I love the Coen brothers' sensibility. It's not my favorite of theirs -- that would be O Brother Where Art Thou -- but it's very good.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|The penguins initially caught my eye, and I thought my grandson would like this game. However, after playing for about ten minutes, I was the one hooked! I think it's cute, and games like this one are the kind that keep me entertained!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Great to play.  Turns your hours into minutes.  Because the time flies when you are playing this game, great way to pass a boring day.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I cant install minecraft pocket edition on my kindle. it keeps saying installation error. I don't know what to do.
B005V4FJC4|5.0|A definite must have for any She & Him fan. And for those that love Christmas music but don't know much about She & Him, you will not be disappointed. Baby it's cold outside, The Christmas Waltz and Rockin' around the Cristmas tree are songs that you will most likely listen to over and over. Good times!
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Handy to backup the pictures from my mobile device. I was able to backup my personal photos with ease from my mobile device.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It held my interest throughout the book but the end was rushed, was disappointed. Now I remember why I haven't read Grishman in awhile he always quick to end  his stories.
030759565X|3.0|It did not excite me at my first look through. I will be better able to judge when I make some of the recipes.
B007EECSFA|3.0|Good start, great ending but sort muddled in the middle. Not sure why the author felt the need to use so many statements in parentheses. I felt those were distracting. Not sure purpose of other family members.
B0087K3VTW|5.0|This was a fun quick read.  NOT the deepest, most layered story out there, but a great first novel that is worth the read, bravo!
B001CTDH76|5.0|Came Early During Holiday Season.. Great Condition :) And Very Reasonable Price for This Gift! I love that it was reliable since it was main part of a gift.
0307341550|5.0|If you have enjoyed her other novels, you will love Sharp Objects! I could write page after page reviewing this novel, if I had the time. For now, I just wanted to add to it's 5 star reviews!
B004PHE9F6|4.0|Great movie, lots of action, made by people who knew what they were doing, with experienced actors and real drivers, just about as close to the real thing as you can get!<br /><br />Get it!
B003Y8YXEO|3.0|Yes it's all very lovely, John Lennon remastered and all that. What really peeves me is the \\"political Correctness\\" that has pervaded our society. They have photoshopped the cigarette out of his hand!!! Good grief. What a sad world it has become.
B0093LINVK|5.0|Had it for a week and it plays everything without a glitch including 3d 1080p.<br />Uses almost no power. 7 watts when playing a movie.<br />Loaded OpenXBMC on to a flash and had it booting in under 20 mins.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lacks CEC support.<br />Does not have IR built in
B003B02PFO|2.0|I had already seen the movie so maybe that is why I did not enjoy the book as much as I usually do.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|If you played any of the other ones, this is exactly the same artwork and amount of cards as other packs. If it's your first time, you'll love this game but it will leave you wanting to get more cards quite soon as you goo they the deck quickly.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It wasn't until one of the main players in this book got  his comeuppance that I began to realize who \\"The Rackateer\\" might be.
B0098VXBIA|4.0|I love the guys in the movie and their &#34;men with kids&#34; club.  I enjoyed all of the individual stories.  It is a good chick flick and good for a laugh with a pregnant friend.  I love the ending with what happens to the gold digger wife who had the incredibly easy pregnancy...
B002KYHZLQ|1.0|This book is horrible. I found the recommendation on some site that said you should read 3 or 4 books to really get into this series. Well maybe its just me (seriously maybe its just me) but I couldn't read this book. I got approximately a quarter of the way into it and gave up.<br /><br />I hated the character names (Quick Ben and Sorry); I found them completely uninteresting. There is no compassion in this universe there is no regret for fallen characters at least I didn't get to it. The universe sucks in my opinion.<br /><br />I realize no opinion is universal; if this type of writing is your thing then here is what you should know.<br />The universe is surrounding perpetual war. It is full of brutish 1 dimensional soldiers who I felt have been broken by life. The author does not throw in millions of un-necessary made up words I'm certain there are a few but you won't have to memorize Klingon to get through this book.<br /><br />If you ignore my bad review and enjoy this book. Please come back and tell others my review was not helpful!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Philippa Gregory does a good job of taking historical nuggets & expanding them into interesting narrative. The reader gets a history lesson wrapped into a story of intrigue.  Bravo
0920668372|5.0|I used to read this book to my daughters when they were little and now  ordered this book for all of my grandchildren.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My family loves Angry Birds.  And the characters on this Star Wars one are so fun!  They just keep getting better and better.  My favorite is on the iPad but we play it on a Kindle Fire too.  Good stuff!!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What more can I say.  Adele's voice is simply magnificent.  I held off buying it because of the rush when she first came out with this album but it was worth the wait.  Love her voice.
1451695195|2.0|I know this neurosurgeon, father and husband (he repeats this many times) experienced something extraordinary, he just isn't skillful at communicating it.  The book could have been 5 pages.  This is really a book for his fellow scientists/neurosurgeons who tend not believe anything they can't see.  But for those of us who already believe in near death experiences, his experience wasn't conveyed in a way that was particularly interesting or compelling.  I found the book unsatisfying.
B009329ZF2|1.0|Entertaining!  Don't watch it for the story line or the acting.  I can't believe how badly acted was this film!
0345803485|1.0|I am appalled that so many people laud this series as sexy.  In addition to Ana being terrified that he'll \\"beat\\" her again (her word, not mine, and he really does beat the tar our of her), he has ignored her saying NO.  He would continue until her physiological responses take over and she orgasms.  Even women raped in alleys by strangers can orgasm.  It doesn't mean they wanted it.  Ana was raped.  Every single person who enjoys this book should be ashamed that they're enjoying reading about a woman being raped.  All of those people saying men need to be more like Christian need to trade positions with me and then try talking about how fun it is to be dealing with trauma still a decade after escaping a creep like Christian (minus the good looks and wealth).  Should we really be telling our daughters to accept abuse and to tell our sons to dole it out?<br /><br />I won't even tough on the terrible writing and how bland the sex scenes were even if they had all been 100% consensual.  This means without coercion, manipulation, and without a woman saying NO.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|While I generally have little patience for the supernatural in a story of any medium, this book was very well written and the supernatural element is not the focus but only the vehicle.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|Being very familiar with the Harry Bosch stories, these stories are very different and a lot of fun. The ending of Cahoots is great and mostly unexpected.
B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|Our family really enjoyed this one...we were on the edge of our seats  We highly recommend this for young and old.
0199573204|5.0|I've only recently been introduced to Stoicism, but I've found Meditations to contain incredible insights into the nature of the universe. Conveying several concepts that are similar to Buddhist ideas, Aurelius stresses the importance of understanding that everything changes, that our negative experiences are a result of the interpretations of events rather than the events themselves, and that we are all a part of a whole system and our failure to realize this causes unnecessary suffering. He encourages humility and living according to the laws of the universe. This will definitely be a book that I will read regularly in the future.<br /><br />As far as the translation is concerned, it is clear and seems to accurately reflect the original message (though I've only briefly compared different translations).
B0090EIILU|1.0|This movie was CRAP! What a horrible embarrasement to Cohen. This was a pure waste to watch and I want not just my money back, but the 90 minutes that was taken from me.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you saw it in the theater and wanted a similar experience at home, this will do it.  Blu-ray looks great, gag real is a nice touch and the digital copy doesn't hurt.  I won't use the 3-d version but I'll take it for free ;)
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I have a difficult time locating the words I want.  Also, it seems to take a loooong time finding the ones I do find.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My three year old cant get enough of this game!  Alot of laughter and learning. Simple to use.  Get this game now :)
B009157BWU|1.0|Tim Allens was the person who narrated this and it was bad. We could not get into it because of his drama mouth. He did not do a good job. His voice went up and down in a very fake dramatic way. The chimps were adorable, but Tim Allen's mouth got in the way. Whoopi Goldberg or Oprah would have done much better. Even someone like Anderson Cooper or Susan Sarandon would have been great. Don't bother watching this.
B000067DGX|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old great nephew.  He is going to flip over this movie.  He will love these characters!
1439152802|5.0|When I started this book I was sure that I knew who the title was about, but as I read I realized that I was wrong.  The beginning made me think that I wasn't sure this was my kind of book, but as I read I feel in love.  I loved this book, I discovered what happened as the book unfolded.  The characters, their lives, their losses and their triumphs are all contained in this story.<br /><br />I loved this book and yet I am having a difficult time telling you why.  The characters were real, their struggles were real and yet it was also beautiful.  I had several guesses about what was happening and who everyone involved was, and I was correct, but it did not take away from the book when the secrets were revealed.<br /><br />Einstein said, \\"Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.\\"  This is a story of a women who was forced to live for others to avoid the life she had been given.  She discovered love for others in service and a love to last the ages.  Also the narrator is a woman who had devoted her life to the stage forgoing a family and love....the reason?  I think you will figure that out.<br /><br />The whole book is wonderful, the ending wrapped up the story, but not too neatly to ruin the realism.  This book goes between the past and now, WWII, 1959, 1961 and 2011.  It is a good size book, but well worth the read.  If you enjoy historical/modern tales of love, loss and life, you will enjoy this book.  Excellent writing with great flow, I will now have to read the rest of this authors back-list.<br /><br />This is a book that will haunt you and you will think about it long after you turn the last page.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was written much better than 50 Shades. <br />It kept my attention which is hard to do!<br />I look forward to the next one.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I thought this would be just another WWII era book but was I ever surprised.  It goes back and forth between the present and the past and between characters which left me turning pages well into the night.  The ending was a total surprise.This was a book club selection and I am looking forward to discussing it tomorrow.
B00005JM02|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old great nephew.  He is going to LOVE this movie and all the characters in it.  I can't wait to watch him watch it!!!!
B0096CDG0O|1.0|I did not want a game that puts out my face book and twitter info. Not explained enough in the description.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, Bale was excellent of course and the movie was taught and gripping. I surely hope this is not the last one for Bale. He really IS Batman!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Works great - fun for my grandchildren, children and myself.  My wife is not that trilled about all the time we spend on it.
1451673442|5.0|Love the book.  I can't wait to put it all into practice!  See if it really works!  Only time and practice will tell!
B007HC3LHS|2.0|This book has a lot going for it...unfortunately, the author was far too repetitious in the OCD department.<br />That aspect could have been halved and still would give us the same punch.<br />Good idea to split the heroine into 'two' people.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Great learning tool for kids (and myself), keeps them interested. Unfolds how the problem is solved prompting you to keep going.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app and easy to use and understand.  Works fine and provides all the info on weather you want to know.
B005H9B44A|3.0|I'm happy I didn't see \\"Thor\\", an average movie at best, at the theater and been unhappy about the money it would have cost me.<br />It looks like I'll be happy having not gone and seen \\"the Avengers\\", too.
B008M721MS|5.0|Just love the Kindle. First had a simple one on my cell phone, then read about Kindle Fire HD and all it could do. Excited about getting it up and running.
0553386794|3.0|I started the George R.R. Martin series because I wanted to read the books before watching the show (which I keep hearing raves about.)<br /><br />I'm not an epic fantasy lover, never have been. Pretty much because of books like these. The writing is lackluster and in places ludicrous... like when Jon Snow is gone off to the Night's Watch and the commander gives him a sword and we get this gem: \\"Yet he could scarcely tell Lord Mormont that it was another man's sword he dreamt of...\\"<br /><br />(For context, the Night's Watch is a military organization charged with patrolling the wall that guards the northern border. Men join for life and must swear vows, including celibacy, and breaking their vows is punishable by death. But the boys still slip off to a nearby village once in a while for a bit of the old in-n-out and everyone just turns a blind eye--cause we can't have the readers thinking they're gay or anything like that.)<br /><br />They're not completely terrible books (I've hated other books more) and Martin does handle multiple storylines and characters well. I find the subplots involving Daenerys, the exiled princess trying to regain her kingdom, and Tyrion, the queen's brother and a dwarf (in the genetic, not fantasy creature, sense), interesting. The book is still solidly middle class white dude fantasy though.<br /><br />(I have gone on to read the next two books and will probably finish the series unless it takes a huge step downward at some point.)
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This movie was fantastic. I found the cultural piece to be entertaining and amusing as the travelers try to adapt to their new environment.
0394826817|4.0|I personally am unfamiliar with the book, but the child's mother put it on her wish list. It will be a Christmas gift.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|American horror story season 2 ashlum:  great, eeri, edge of your seat.  Record 4 weeks at a time because I don;t want to wait.
B00008ADPF|4.0|For those who enjoy the style of Nickelback's music and lyrics, this album will not disappoint. True to their musical journey and unique style, this album will fit in to your expectations on a platform of good quality production. With a blend of upbeat tempo and slow content, the group expands on their musical path.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|I would have given it 3.5 but it was either 3 or 4 stars...overall it was an enjoyable action movie
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I am not a huge science fiction reader and actually stumbled on this by accident. I am a dutch guy and generally like well thought-through novels like books written by  ken follett (read pillars of the earth!!) and Wilbur Smith (read monsoon!!). For me these kind of writers produce novels that are both exciting as informative.<br /><br />This novel, being non fiction, of course has no informative value. But the novel did grab me. Especially the first part made me very curious and the tension is very well build up.. and a very surprising ending, which makes you want to read more!! No disturbing style of writing (which can be a real problem being a foreigner).<br /><br />Although the novel has a high turn this page content, it seems to me the last four parts are actually a struggle to fabricate a decent ending to the first parts. All and all not a true classic! If you like science fiction and have a lot of spare time.. read it! If not please read books mentioned above!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|1.0|the download never happened correctly.  We eventually got the audio only with no picture.  the TV was black.<br />I'd like a confirmed refund please.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|This album seems to increase the quality level across the board, from earlier albums. Musically and especially lyrically, there seems to be heightened sensitivity to some songs that travel a very emotional journey - 'Just to get high, Never gonna be alone and If today was your last day'. For me, this album has the ability to hit the listeners different moods with various songs in the tradition of the Nickelback musical style. For Nickelback fans, this album must be listened to many times and is a must within the collection. Listen to the lyrics enveloped by the music and enjoy the journey - a great album and good quality production.
B004GYY714|3.0|It is a good application but it stops and starts buffering somethings for minutes, My kindle fire has really good signal on Wi-Fi and it still buffers forever.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Great condition for a used dvd. The description of the dvd was right on. The disc and case were perfect.
B008QTVNUI|3.0|Episode 9 would play for approximately 11 minutes and then it would die. It didn't matter which player I used to watch it with, it would not play. Paying for a season and then one episode doesn't play, leaves a disappointed customer.
B00005NWM3|4.0|For those who enjoy the style of Nickelback's music and lyrics, this album will not disappoint. True to their musical journey and unique style, this album will fit in to your expectations on a platform of good quality production.

B004LWZWGK|1.0|This does not reflect my views of the movie. I would give the movie 4 stars.<br /><br />I bought this movie because it said it comes with a \\"digital copy\\" but it does not come with one that works with iTunes. That is the only reason I bought this. Stupid UltraViolet does not work with iTunes or the Apple TV. Only streaming.<br /><br />They need to specify the differences between iTunes and UV.<br /><br />Digital Copy use to mean iTunes but I guess it doesn't any more. Be Careful buying from now on...
B0013ND30M|5.0|Great condition for a used dvd. The description of the dvd was right on. The disc and case were perfect.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A good read. The second time round for me. I found it an interesting story, that I wanted more of.
B0061S073A|5.0|I love this child lock. It's simple and has no extra distractions.  It keeps my child away from everything else but gives her the freedom to pick her &quot;games&quot; on her own. Has ability to enable airplane mode upon entering which prevents any advertisements, unwanted purchases or unsupervised visits to the web. Highly recomend.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|it's fun and a little fustrating trying to get them all down, my husband even is having a good time
B0098VXE50|5.0|I found that the tale was significantly updated and overall more beliveable.<br />In comparison with the other &#34;Snow White Movie - 'Mirror, Mirror'&#34; which came out at the same time, this was more vissereal.
B000AGTPUU|1.0|I have not watched this movie yet I am saving it for Christmas.  The Previews of the movie were very good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is my second time reading it. I read it all in one sitting (that's how much I liked it). I would recommend this to teens who don't like reading (it got my brother to read!)
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great ending!  Best MIB of all with a great suprise ending.  Don't miss this one, its ties all of them together.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible is great!  It's not the version I'm used to, but it works just fine.  It's got just a verse or the whole chapter..All should read it..
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie is amazing! I absolutely loved it! It made me cry. I'm SO GLAD they made one honoring heroes in this country. With Obama cutting military spending and the country going down the drain, it gives me hope that there are selfless heroes willing to fight for this country. This makes me proud to be an American; unlike the President and those who support him. How cool is it that there are still people who are willing to do this kind of thing? Selfless sacrifice......very hard to find in this society of entitlement. If I could give it six stars, I would!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is romantic and funny I can't stop reading it .you should read it. Read it read it read it
B00632HWOG|4.0|I do like yahoo mail.  I have no complaints really.  Yahoo mail is always easy to access, and simple to use.
B004GVUPFE|2.0|Choppy graphics (movement), puzzles are &quot;too hard&quot; for the levels they are on, and non-intuitive way of counting moves. There are many games out there like thus that are simply better.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|First off, if you bought Discovery or Musique or a previous Daft Punk album, you will love this album. However, if this is your first album and you have only listened to a small amount of their music, you may not like it. Why? Let's just say it has a few songs that are acquired tastes, like caviar!<br />Pros and cons on a CD?! (yeah I know)<br />Pros<br />-Such great dance music<br />-Cool black CD that you can only read if you deflect light on it.<br /><br />Cons<br />-Acquired taste(could be a pro for a yuppie or somebody like that)<br />-Not as good as Discovery<br />-Album cover isn't as cool as Discovery! (Hah not really a con)<br /><br />Now I know I put 3 cons and 2 pros, but trust me, this album is worth it if you've liked Daft Punk for a while.
0812993357|5.0|During the early 1980's when I was considering a career, I really wanted to become a fashion editor, this was around tthe time that the orginal Supermodels were coming up, Anna Wintour was changing Vogue, Versace ruled, etc,etc. But that choice of career never panned out. I realized that it was way more than sitting front row at a fashion show and it was better to have a job where you could afford designer clothers! LOL Anyway I just finished reading Grace Coddibgton's memoir and truly enjoyed it.I was always fimilar with her woork at Vogue and enjoyed her in the September Issue. Her memoir is honest, she is not bitchy or gossipy but she does share her truths about the fashion indutry and its many players. She does not slam Anna Wintour at all, but makes certain comments based on thier working life and work style together. They do get along and truly respect each other. She comments here about her other colleages such as Polly Mellen, especially Carlyne Cerf de Dudzeele, the supoermodel era, etc. She does shed light on how ALL the fashion photographers and designers are so ego driven and tells of some of their spats, when they dont get thier way. And she does talk about a good amount of people who were in and out of her life as a model and fashion editor. I must mention that she has included some of her pictures when she modeled, I loved those she was very attractive, thier is one picture that I love, it was from 1962 and for British HArpers Bazaar, where she looks so good, the pictuce reminded me so much of the ad for Versace back in the 1980's that featured Linda E, Christy T, and Helenana C . It is an easy read and I read the book in 2 days(I had to stop because I didn't want to finsih it in one sitting) It also has some of her most famous work she has done with a variety of fashion photographers and her work both at British and American Vogue. On a side note, thru this book I have a new found \\"thought\\" about Anna Wintour and the complexies of her job as editor in chief (I dont envy her at all)
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|There was more of a story line than I expected, so I rated it 4 stars instead of 3. My husband and grandson were equally entertained by the music, dance, and cool cars.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|Liked the portrayal of Nelson Mandela by Morgan Freeman.  This movie shows the passionate side of people in South Africa, who were willing to work together to end Apartheid.
0061438294|5.0|Great book. Recommend to anyone who wants to learn about the nonverbal communication. This book provides details, examples and pictures from real life examples. Easy read.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|This movie is a true account of the social struggles that the people of Asia endured. The man that lead the social movement Gandhi and his personal sacrifices for the good of all. I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
B000IZA9PI|3.0|I never cared for the full length movies of the &#34;Next Generation&#34; cast but faithfully watch the TV series episodes. They have more scientific,psychological reaction involvement rather than the violent arms shootouts in the movies. The cast of characters in the &#34; Next Generation&#34; series have ALWAYS been a tribute to Gene Roddenberry's writings and have stimulated my senses form deep thought to outright laughter.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Game is addictive and fun to play.  However, while playing the game and almost reached the last stage, the game freezes.  Although it allowed me to reinstall the game without having to pay again, have to start from 1sr stage again.
0307887960|5.0|Got this book in quickly and as stated.  Have been very successful with program.  Have lost 12 pounds in 5 weeks and several inches.  Minimizes cravings and is easy to follow.  Feel so much better about myself
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|Commercials were perfect, they gave you a great snapshot of all the humor in the movie without even comin close to giving away all the punch lines. Great comedy to watch when you just want to let loose and laugh.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So thankful amazon had this season so quickly! Amazing show! And so grateful for Amazon! We also got our breaking bad season 5 here!<br />Both shows are outstanding!!!!
1881273377|5.0|This is great!  I think everyone should either read the book or listen to the CD.  It really helps you understand how people feel loved differently.
B009JBZH54|2.0|I love these movies. I did not get to go tho the theater to see the third movie. I knew that they would make a box set and I could watch it when I got the set. Well to my disappointment I did not get The Dark Knight Rises. Its just missing. I did however get two Dark Knight Rises special features disks. Be careful if you are giving this as a Christmas gift and check to make sure that all the correct disks are there. Any way Warner Bros. can send me The Dark Knight Rises movie please?
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really liked this book about life in a small town in rural England and the drama that ensued but i'm not sure how much it would appeal to someone who has never lived in England.
B008MEM24S|5.0|It's a fun and challenging game. Similar enough to Where's my Water, yet still different and exciting. I love the balooney secret files
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book it was so sweet and detailed about how everything works in panem. I absolutely love the Hunger Games
B00138KE2C|5.0|Can a person expect anything better from a band with a lead singer likee Dave Grohl.<br />Best acoustic  version of everlong a guy could ask for.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously, I only read this book because there was so much publicity but it was a waste of my time.  I found it to be very repetitive and not at all well written.
B002LMV7TS|4.0|I found this on black Friday for $8. You can't beat that price. This normally goes for $20 which I think is a little too much. Get it if you can find it under $20 as the blu-ray isn't that much of an upgrade over the DVD.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this book I didn't like the ending because it rushed though peeta and katniss felling In love again but I can't complain I loved this trilogy
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My daughter loves this movie!  She used her own money to purchase it and the quality was there.  No mistakes or strange European formatting!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book i could not put it down im currently reading more Nicholas Sparks books. I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!! :)
B000UVT3OI|4.0|This cd is great, It also comes with a dvd of music videos of the songs on the two cds
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love all the parts between peeta and katniss. It really is so details. Suzanne Collins really is a good write I wish she would write more
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This DVD was a must have for our movie collection.  It was a great way to show my daughter a little history and spend time together with entertainment and conversation.  Seller provided a good product(:
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on multiple devices (kindle fire, droid razr m, computer). Great way to stay organized for random notes and shopping lists.
B009FXIICK|3.0|An ok match three games, my big problem with this was the difficulty curve was too steep. After a few short levels, you find that the time moves too quick in the game is over before you can even spot a match. An adjustment, IMO, is needed to the difficulty to make this game worthwhile.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|So nice to read this classic after years of watching movie versions.  As with most books that are turned into movies, the book is always better .
B0068FYZLG|5.0|We dig this production - after taking my daughter to see it live on stage, she cannot get enough.  We did confuse the issue ordering it though and ordered the 'musical' version and not the stage production version.  Happy with the DVD though and we will re-order the other version.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Fabulous series.  Will definitely be watching all future seasons.  Reminds me of the Tudors, but only way better story line and acting.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|When the human reluctance to think rationally meets classic economics' insistence that we always analyze our choices in a cold-blooded mathematical way, we come face to face with the endlessly fascinating subject matter of this book. It turns out we're not as clever as we would like to think.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is bonkers, y'all. Simply bonkers. If you thought Season 1 was a trip-fest, well, buckle up for ASYLUM.<br /><br />I love the concept for this show, in that each miniseries-style 'season' is completely unrelated to what was aired prior. The writing in ASYLUM continues to be strong, weaving all sorts of twisted sub-plots together in a delightful frenzy of bizarro, and the cast, led by the wonderful Jessica Lange, is awesome. Also: I want Lily Rabe to be my girlfriend.<br /><br />This show isn't scary so much as just flippin' weird. I have absolutely no idea what the heck is going on and how the various demon-possessed nuns, zombies, aliens, serial killers, and fallen angels are connected to one another within the context of the over-arching storyline, but I don't care. I'm along for the ride. One of the funnest shows on TV right now. As long as you're not squeamish. Get some.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This movie had great quality and there were scenes that were not seen before.  I watched with a big group of friends and it was so fun pointing out what we thought was a scene not in the one we are used to seeing on TV!
6305603847|5.0|if you love pink floyd you will love this dvd.alot of great music paired with some videos and different backings for the songs
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Fun escape movie.  Josh Brolin hit the mark dead on! Will Smith is always good in these movies.  We liked it!
0375703861|2.0|The mid-line to one star reviewers have it right. This book is a chore to read. You do find yourself beginning to relate to a character and understand them and the author switches to another character. You will find that the author loves to hear her own voice. Or so it seems. I made it 7/8's of the way through the book and decided it was just not worth the effort. Leans toward pomposity and bombast.
0316044938|5.0|When you lose a child, is she still with you?  Many do us wish it were true, although not perhaps in the painful way that Susie inhabits in the world between.  While Susie is the narrator, much of what she tells us concerns those of us left behind.  She lingers between heaven and earth to solve her murder and to minister to the family that remains wounded behind her.  More complex than the movie, and just as lyrical, this is a lovely book.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|The twitter App for kindle is useful in that it's easier to access but there are no special features that come with it other than notifications of tweets. Unlike the iPhone Apps, the Twitter App on Kindle is merely a bookmark to twitter where as the iPhone ones offer many options such as viewing instant replies, who retweets your tweets and emoji icons.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|I usually love the types of movies, but I found this one boring and the characters annoying.  I was very disappointed.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Some of the songs that I found on youtube wouldnt come up on this app...it would always bum me out..it also slows down your device and its got a lame virus I'm pretty sure!
0316096199|4.0|Sebold had been writing The Lovely Bones that begins with the rape and murder of a young girl, when she found she had to stop and write this book.  She had been raped , and &#34;lucky&#34; to have survived it.  In the reactions of her family, law enforcement, and the rapist himself, Sebold found the lack that she needed to survive the attack in her heart as well.  The writing is honest and without an attempt to justify herself.  Well worth reading.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the most well written books I have ever read. I think I felt just about every emotion possible.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Very well written, I could picture everything as I was reading the book. One of the best books I have read in a long time. Great story, great Author.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The ultimate in gaming headset. Perfect sound and great features. You can even change your voice. We did a lot of comparison shopping and we are very pleased that we chose this headset.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I knew and loved a young girl who knew she was dying, so I am a very tough critic to get by on this subject. I think Hazel is an impressive portrayal of a girl who knows she has a limited time to live.  And she finds another person to journey with her in Augustus.  For adults lurking on the edges of a child facing death, the puzzle of comfort is all but overwhelming.  But I agree with Hazel, she doesn't fear death as much as she fears obliteration and never having mattered.  As time goes by, many of us adults forget the passion that burned in us to be a star in the sky.  This fate appears to have befallen the author they pursue.<br /><br />Whatever the answer, when our stars have given us little time in which to shine, the fault must lie in them.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|Just saw it, rented it. Best movie I have seen in a long time. Really enjoyed it.<br />Actually made me laugh a few times.
B00846REIS|2.0|This book was prolonged and boring. I found myself skipping and scanning the book just to finish it. I enjoyed the excitement of 50 shades, this is just a poor and sloppy rendition.
B004EPYZUI|1.0|I bought Sucker Punch because I only read the 5 Star reviews on the main page here and I thought it was going to be a silly Action movie with some attractive women going around on a light adventure type flick, but it is about the theme of abuse. Also, it looks this way on the DVD cover, and after watching it I feel lied to and sick because of this abuse. In the beginning after her mother is probably murdered by the abusive father and when the young girl accidently kills her younger sister in a failed attempt to protect her from their evil abusive father, I hoped that she would at least kill this disgusting abuser but she doesn't and he then pays to have her put in a bleak mental institution, and this is when I knew this is not the light Action movie I believed it would be. I thought it might get better if she grows up to escape and kills her abusive father but she doesn't and it gets worse. The girls in the institution are in many ways further abused. Sucker Punch is a movie about young girls being constantly abused. The DVD cover should say Sucker Punch is about abuse. Even if there is a few scenes with girls in skirts, I could not even look at them as being attractive because of knowing how in the institution they are being abused by abusers and this abuse is sickening. The actors and animation scenes were ok, had it not been for the theme of abuse. Then some of the young girls after being exploited, manipulated, and abused, are killed and thus don't escape. I felt sucker punched by not knowing before that the main theme is young girls being constantly abused. Do NOT buy Sucker Punch. If it was on tv I would have changed the channel, but I watched the DVD and out of over 100 DVD's I have seen so far this is only the second DVD that I have thrown in the garbage so no one else has to feel sick watching the theme of abuse in Sucker Punch.
B0058O84G0|3.0|i remember reading Pillars of the Earth and enjoying it so much. thus, i downloaded Fall of Giants without thinking twice. what a disappointment. it was more like a history book with the characters added to make it more palatable: the figures were flat, storyline predictable and the politics too convoluted. the characters were  black or white: good or bad. i love historical novels and have read many. i like to become involved with the people in the story but this book aroused no emotions in me whatsoever. pity, because i usually like ken follett books. i won't be reading the other books in the trilogy, of course.
B000ICXQF6|4.0|You could tell this is Gilliam's work without actually knowing it; very similar to his others.  Not my favorite; that would be reserved for Brazil.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|It is a big pleasure to listen again the songs of this group that belongs to the story of the music
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Easy to use. Love that I can mark dates on the calendar with different coloring for family, work or personal. I also like that a reminder shows on the top left corner of my kindle when I have an event marked on the calander for that day.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I was totally surprised at how the cd came to me so fast i wasnt excepting it till a wk later.
B008RDHYJM|2.0|Let me preface this review by stating that I am a long time Kylie Minogue fan. I have enjoyed her music since she released \\"The Locomotion\\" back in '87 and even bought her debut album on cassette. Since I live in the United States, keeping up with Kylie's career in the pre-internet days was virtually impossible because the majority of her music has not been heavily promoted or released here. When Fever became a semi-hit here and the internet came along, I finally got my mitts on Kylie's back catalog. I have been collecting Kylie merchandise ever since. As a collector, I'm no stranger to paying a stupid amount of money for imports, deluxe CDs or even \\"rare\\" items. If the item is good, I'll just wince at the amount but pay it anyway because once you start collecting, it's hard to stop.<br /><br />When I read that Kylie was releasing a box set of all her singles to celebrate her 25 years in music, I was overjoyed. I knew it would be pricey but to have all the singles, B-sides and remixes at once? Yay! I shopped around, found the best price I could and bought it. After two weeks, a small package arrived in my mailbox. I had no idea what it could be because the only thing I ordered was the Kylie box set. Surely this tiny package didn't have my box set in it. Oh yes, yes it did.<br /><br />While I was aware that the discs included in this set are those 3-inch discs, I really didn't expect the whole thing to be so small but hey, I can deal with a teeny tiny box set if it were jammed packed with 25 CDs with all the B-sides and remixes. Well, strike two because this set contains no B-sides or remixes - just the singles which have been released and re-released on numerous Greatest Hits albums (seriously, Kylie has a TON of Greatest Hits albums). The original artwork also isn't there. The covers are just basic black-and-white photocopies of the original single covers. Considering the price, I think whomever dreamed this up could have done a lot better. From what I understand, clearing the rights to all the singles, b-sides, remixes, and artwork just wasn't possible. I don't know if that's the real reason but it sounds serviceable to disappointed fans who feel like they were ripped off.<br /><br />It's a pity that more work wasn't put into this because other artists have put out some amazing box sets that include all the bells and whistles. It's also a pity because so many of Kylie's older singles are difficult to find at reasonable prices. Sellers on eBay have long been attempting to sell the [[ASIN:B00000G6GK Cowboy Style]] single for hundreds of dollars. Don't even get me started on the stupid crazy prices some sellers slap on the coveted [[ASIN:B002Y8AAHO Butterfly]] single. I thought this release might very well put those people out to pasture but that likely won't happen.<br /><br />The collector in me is glad I bought this for completion sake, but the logical part of me is miffed that this is priced at $100+ and doesn't include anything that fans can't get from a few moderately priced Greatest Hits cds. If you're not a hardcore collector or a super fan, I say skip it. Even if you are a hardcore collector who just can't skip a Kylie release because your obsession won't let you, I advise you to wait until this is priced under $100. I know it's a \\"Limited Edition\\" (how those words have caused me to spend needless amount of money on so many UN-Limited items), but I can't see this going out of print because too many fans are disappointed with it.clearing the rights to all the singles, b-sides, remixes, and artwork just wasn't possible.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|Fantastic!  This series just gets &#34;better with age&#34;!  I hope there is another successful season.  I can't wait to watch future episodes.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I would have given his game 5 stars but the ultimate downfall of this game is that it deletes your progress randomly. No matter how many times you reinstall it or replay it , sooner or later it will set you back to level one with all your money and that's it. That wouldn't be so bad if the next mission  didn't require you to level up and purchase moves but you can't because a) are a higher level and can't possibly level up on random events because they aren't open to you or b) you leveled up your character to max level.      To further put some salt on your wounds , the game will have a menu pop up and say \\" you can't afford these skill points, would you like to buy them from our e-shop? So not only do you LOSE progress from your game ( I was level 38 with 18,500 coins) but no matter how many times I restarted I was set back to the beginning, Unless this game gets a patch on the Kindle soon I recommend you avoid this at all cost.    EDIT: Grammer edits
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|This was a christmas gift i gave 2 my sister maybe a yr or 2 ago.  Very cute movie...gotta love me some HAM.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I thought it would be scrappy because it was free, I was sooooooo wrong! My friend recommended it, I'm glad he did.
B008N1V11U|1.0|I am not happy at all. I tried to download it but it said there wasn't enough space so I deleted a ton of stuff and it still says I cant do it. it uses up way to much space. I'm really bummed. I really wanted to see what all the hype was about.
B001IF277K|4.0|I know you get what you pay for, so I decided to pay a little more and buy this particular battery. My phone was not holding a charge and this seemed to work. I gave in and bought an iPhone a couple of months later, though, so I can't speak to the longevity of the product.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This show is one of my favorites. I love the suspense and I truly recommend it. Now I can't wait for next season.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Cheesy movie.  Only the music was good everything else was cheesy.  Could only sit through the first 10 minutes then gave up.
0316078913|4.0|This was a good book, but I'd read several of the stories already and it was a pretty short book overall. For people who have read most of David Sedaris' books already, there isn't a lot of new material here. Still, it got me in the holiday spirit, and I could see myself re-reading this next year.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|Why wouldn't I rate this movie 5 stars? This movie rocks, I don't care what anyone says. Best movie I've seen in a long time I'm so happy to have this in my movie collection.
0385535147|5.0|Lost a lot of sleep with this &#34;couldn't put it down&#34; book.  My only question is, &#34;What's he going to do for an encore?&#34;
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i like it its fun and makes the time go by fast. i watch yhe show with my daughter on the hub she loves it too.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Loved the movie and the bluray book packaging is awesome. A movie for everyone. If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I tried another weather app first, one with high ratings.  I think it's called WeatherPro, or something similar.  But it could never find my small-town location, nor the nearby city.  So no local weather for me!  I went immediately to this app, &amp; it's beautiful - it has everything!  Including my LOCAL weather.  I highly recommend it.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|The concepts are very good and inspiring... Although I do have to say, that the web is changing a lot... and so, to build an MVP these days... you need: a user engine, facebook integration, friend connection system, stats, follow system, internal messaging system, viral mechanisms, moderation features, and good clean design... and thats no small task.  After all that, then yeh, you can build your MVP with all that in it... I say this, because peoples expectations of what they &#34;want&#34; from a system, has increased and the bar has been risen. (My opinion).
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Unusual story line with a few rather forced transitions. Amusing caricatures of various political types. Quite entertaining if you are willing to suspend a bit of disbelief.
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|The Dark Knight Rises just keep me lost all the way through.<br />Maybe just me but could not stay with it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Lots of action and good character usage.  Translate pretty well to the &#34;small screen&#34; for a movie with these dynamics.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|A little difficult to take off but it seems like a sturdy case (never dropped the phone though) and a nice, clear case, and a great way to represent Amazon :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I Loved this book! It only took me a day to read it bc I could not put my kindle down!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Between the completely engaging character of Pi and the novel's fascinating exploration of human response to violence and trauma, Life of Pi earns the highest recommendation I can give.
B009329ZF2|5.0|The computer animation is blended well into the action and translates well to the &#34;small screens&#34;.  Worked better than in the theater.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had no idea what this book was about, I went in cold. I am glad too because I had no preconceived ideas. It is a unique mystery story written by both the husband and wife's point of view. It kept me wanting to read to find out what happened. I really enjoyed this book!
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Have suggested this movie for couples in counseling.  Its realistic in some ways, many ways actually.  I am a marriage counselor and I've seen this kind of drama played out in families hundreds of times.  It's real.  It's gutsy.  It's sad.  It's true.  If you can't stand intense inter-personal drama, you won't like this movie.  If you are interested in marriage, helping amarriage, changing your life, and finding purpose in life, this movie may be inspiring to you.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I love Kelly Clarkson.  She is so talented and I enjoy listening to all of her music.  You will love this CD.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The DVD still translates well to the small screen with or without HD.  The value of the movie to own and share is unbeatable.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Love this movie, Im a Snow White fan and this had the edgier side to the story.<br />Very cool if you like fairytales but want the adult version.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Get it. Easy to use. I use it to watch items when at work,lol.  Downloaded fast  and meets my needs
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd - Dark Side Of The Moon (1973) SACD<br /><br />.... I must have been drunk at the time........<br /><br />  Well I guess it only took me 3 years on this darn BLOG to get around to reviewing my all time Fav album !  Yes I know ....total Cliche !!<br /><br />  What Ever !!!<br /><br />As a kiddie this was the album that turned me onto progressive rock.........My brother Danny bought a copy of this album and I was literally mesmerized for years and years and years....<br /><br />  Alan Parsons and Pink Floyd ......they never got any better than this....<br /><br />  I think the one thing that is often not talked enough about on this album and likely is one of the reasons why I still adore this recording is the fine use of percussion.  This is Floyds more percussive album maybe next to Ummagumma and combined with the huge Soul presence on this album has me all the way.<br /><br />  Every tune on Dark Side is simply mind numbing.....and the fine use of space and emptiness only adds to the adoration this album has meant to me.  I think this album really shines in both Percussion and breathing space ....and funny the second song is aptly titled BREATHE.......kind of makes you wonder if there is more design than you ever thought eh !!<br />  You can note count the number of times I have sat and listened to this album and each time I still marvel at its brilliance and complexity yet calmness and simplicity.<br />  I also have tons of memories of this one.......everything from my pal Miles doing MONEY as an airband in my highschool days to the posters from the vinyl that I had over my bed for 4 years at University.<br />  Enough said................the lunatic is in my head..........
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's like playing mario brothers on your kindle except its a leprechan.  My 4, 7, and 8 year old kids all love this little game.  Its got arrows in the corners of the kindle screen which make it easy to control.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed reading about the raid from the operators side of it. Book was well written and really helped me understand the pressure placed upon these operators and how skilled they are.
0920668364|5.0|I loved this children's book when I was about 7 or 8 and always thought it was cute. Although my niece was 1 at the time, I'm sure when she starts reading or having my sister read she will enjoy it as well. Very meaningful and great product!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a timed game which adds a challenge. You need to meet or beat your previous times to get credit toward beating each tile layout. You must beat each of eight layouts three times in four different dragon colors. I'm not too good so I have a lot of games to play.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|As far as games go my kids love the app.  The one complaint I have is that there is no apparent exit button for when they are finished playing and need to turn the app off.  You have to bring up the tools menu to get the kindle bar to pop up so you can tell it to return to home, because just tapping the screen doesn't bring the bar up on its own.  This seems to be an issue with several of gameloft's apps and I really wish they would add an exit app button to their games.  I get really tired of having to turn it off eery tim the kids are done because they can't figure it out on their own.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|They arrived on time and were all in grate shape no issues at all i use them every day thanks
0689835604|5.0|I purchased this for my niece who loved flipping the tabs up. She really began to learn words and all that. Would reccommend for early learning.
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Never in my life had i seen a movie get so much hate being called one of the worst suoerhero movies trash,horrible,crap.this needs to stop of coarse when peter goes emo and when he dances is really stupid but come on thats what your mostly nit picking to say that what kills spider-man<br />and saying that this movie is batman and robin bad no it does not kill spider-man or just as bad and batman and robin its not people has to stop<br />and grow up besides there are plenty of worse super-hero movies out there for example spawn,superman4,steel,ghost-rider,catwoman,elektra,and blade trinity.and the action scences are top notch so are the effects there phenominal all though it sucks that venom only appeard for 30 mins<br />hey but nobody complained that how two face was wasted at the end of dark knight and saying theres too many villans even theres not nobody complained that how there were 4 villans in batman the movie made in 1966.anyway just because the fans were so butt hurt we did'nt get a spidey 4 oh no we got the piece of crap the amazing spider-man instead.anyway i just wanted to make a point on this movie and i do reccomend this movie it is worth your time.and that's my review a must buy
B0053O89Z6|3.0|The shipment took a lot longer than I had hoped. I could have bought it cheaper at Wal-Mart and sooner and didn't realize it until I already purchased it on here.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|An easy to read introduction/reminder of ancient, well vetted ways to handle stress, worry and life's disasters.The reader joins the author on visits to various contemporary wise men with an open mind, health scepticism, and some awe.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Nice movie to watch every year!  It's one of those movies that's a classic and belong in every household.  Funny!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I loved this movie when it first came out i still love it today and yes i love it way more than spider-man 2 Tobey Maguire was the perfect Spider-man way better than Andrew Garfield.Kirsten Dunst was a Great Mary Jane.Willem Dafoe Was Perfect as the GREEN GOBLIN.And J.K.Simons i love him as j.jonahjameson in all 3 movies even though the cgi is really outdated and the diolouge is absolutly horrendous but that does'int make it bad.all in all this is one the best super-hero movies of all time and one of my favorite superhero flicks Great action,great music by Danny Elfmen.Great Ending,Great Origon,Great Everything!!!! 10/10,5/5,4/4,100/100.I definitly recomend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series. This was my second time reading it and I think I may start reading them again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|What an excellent read, utterly captivating throughout. I will undoubtedly be reading the sequels. Disappointing it had to end so abruptly.
B000HEVALC|5.0|I have spent hours listening to this cd.  Great to hear them just enjoying the music because it's what they love.  It's not for everyone I am sure.  They cut up with each other, don't finish evey song they start & at times are hard to hear.  Great cd, though.  My husband even laughs along with it & sings all the crazy stuff they sing right along with me.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I love this game! My fingers are a little big for the keys which adds to the challenge but I still love it!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|This could have been a good movie. The plot was decent but Kristen Stewart killed it all with her facial expression. and her terrible acting skills. The movie was good quality though.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|a very differnt plot -- totally enjoyed it -- took some twists and turns and a diverse cast of characters.<br />Especially liked Mr. Penumbra
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I have this product & have had since the 1st iPad came out.  Our daughter got an iPad 2 so I gave these as a gift.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|This has an amazing collection of older songs on it and is done beautifully!  I'm not even a very big blues fan, but this cd is impossible not to like.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|This movie was terrible. The plot is terrible, the acting was not good, and the plot was terrible. This movie was just retarded.
1432794426|5.0|In a few hundred pages, Dr. Karen Moriarty has enlightened me as to the struggles and unknown accomplishments of a great man, righting the wrong perceptions of his life and mannerisms and leaving me more than satisfied with this purchase.  Diana G.
B00A2XU9IS|2.0|I love the idea and think this is pretty darn cute for my young kids.  In this app the windows that are used to &quot;countdown&quot; could be considered backwards.  In a traditional advent countdown calender the days start with 24 and then move down to 1 (counting down how many days are left.)  This app has you starting at 1 and moving up to 24 (going along with the date on a calender.)  After each little &quot;skit&quot; an elf does show up to say how many days are until Christmas, so it does get the job done.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it!!! Weather app works well,sometimes does not like to leave notifications though!!!I guess I need to have more words to submit this..so here ya go!
B0011E7JBW|4.0|The movie is always good. I have watched it a thousand times. The quality of the movie was pretty good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft sooooo much and really love it on the kindle fire! I think it has great graphics, fun adventures, lots of possibilities, and much more. I am so glad it came out on the kindle and now I'm playing minecraft a lot more than I used to. get this app and you'll have a new awesome hobby.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I think Beyonce us a talented artist. I think her music is inspiring and beautiful. I'm a big fan off her music seems when I listen to Beyonce, her music takes me into another zone.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|John Grisham is a great writer not only for adults but for kids, too.  A must read for future lawyers.
B009O2XY12|1.0|It became corrupted.  Had to unload.<br />Merry chritsmas to all and you know the rest.  words, words words words word
B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|I love Seether! They are my all-time favorite band. Every CD of their's is awesome in my eyes. I'm really glad I bought this one  though, it completed my discography.
B008TMOIEK|5.0|I bought the romantic piano along with this music and I'm so glad I did.  Just beautiful and recommend to all who enjoy classical music
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I've always loved Johnny Cash and the whole story. It is definitely worth adding to the movie collection!
B0049J0CTM|4.0|The movie was a little long, but the graphics were terrific. Unfortunately, I'm a little scared of being underwater--so it was somewhat disquieting.
B004H83IM8|5.0|I've watched these movies several times since getting them in the mail. Austin Powers is hilarious! If you like the Austin Powers series, I highly recommend getting this. All three? It's a great deal.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I wish I could only say the best things about this book. I adore Ellen, she is a kind, genuine person who has a personality of gold. That being said, it was difficult to find this book intriguing. She has a great point of view on life, but most of what she says seems to be very common sense. This book would be great to give to your neighbor who had been stealing all your flowers from your garden, or your kid that says he wants to deliver Pizzas for the rest of his life, but if it is for a well grounded moral person,you might pass. All in all, I appreciate her putting her good ideas and kind ways in the universe and making me giggle a bit, but I can do without rliving the lessons my grandma already taught me.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I finally bought my own copy rather than waiting to see it on tv. Hilarious movie- my favorite for years. This new blu ray was cheaper than a used DVD copy on an online auction site.  Shipped super fast.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I suppose there is a \\"type\\" of person who will like this book. I loved it because I like science (but don't know enough of it), I like problem solving, I understand the character, I'm kind an introvert, and I've spent a lot of time alone on boats. I'm positive my automobile-obsessed, deeply mechanical brothers will love it. I'm quite certain my science-writer sister will admire it and think it is very well written but she might tear it apart for purely \\"writer's workshop\\" kinds of reasons (virtually no viable female characters for example). My wife would hate it because there is only one main character and pretty much all he talks about is the details of his survival on Mars using NASA training to modify NASA-built devices. He's a wise-guy. He rarely gets deeply despondent or reacts in a non-astronaut, non-nerd, anti-rational way (otherwise he would have died).<br /><br />All that doesn't matter. It's a very, very good, modern Robinson Caruso kind of tale that anyone with a bit of tech in their blood will love. If you learned the science behind everything he does you would have a pretty good start on chemistry, biology, materials science, astrophysics, planet science, electronics, certain kinds of math, and a kind of survival decision-making.<br /><br />So kudos to Andy Weir. I have no idea who he is or what else he's written but he's done us all a service. I'm deeply impressed that he knows so much science and is confident enough to put it on the line. This is well written and well-edited (especially compared to the usual SciFi dreck). On top of that he is selling it for a dollar and gives permission to pass it on for free. What a guy!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|It was nothing like Angry birds, it was too boring. I had problems launching the pigs. I truly don't like it
B002ZTQVBQ|4.0|Studio Ghibli's 'Ponyo' is a magical story inspired by The Little Mermaid. The story is about the love between two individuals who inhabit two very different worlds and how they cross the barrier to be with each other. The animation is as gorgeous as it usually is in Studio Ghibli films, and the story is quite enchanting.<br /><br />Ponyo is a goldfish who lives in the ocean, but wants to see more of what the ocean and the world have to offer. So one day she escapes from the watchful eye of her father and begins to explore the ocean, only to find herself swept away to land where she is rescued by a young boy named, Sōsuke. Ponyo and Sōsuke quickly grow attached to each other. However, Ponyo's father, fearing that she was kidnapped by the human boy, forcibly takes his daughter back. The father is not the villain of the story, but he is someone who has had bad experiences with human earlier in his life. He is naturally overprotective of his daughter. Poor Sōsuke is desolate without Ponyo and Ponyo too feels saddened by the turn of events. But Ponyo is a plucky little goldfish, and having tasted a bit of human blood when she was on ground, transforms from goldfish to human and sets out to return to land and to Sōsuke. The rest of the story swims along quite magically to a wonderful conclusion.<br /><br />Ponyo has been compared to My Neighbor Totoro, and I can see that. Unlike other Studio Ghibli films, there is no real environmental message here, though there is some mention of balance. The film is just an enjoyable, sweet story (and certainly far happier than the original Hans Christian Anderson telling of The Little Mermaid).

B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is fun, fun, fun and funny.  I like how the birds are dressed up like the star wars chracters!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This series has so much detail, so many characters and so many twists and turns it's no wonder it has such a crazy devoted following. Once you start reading the first one you won't be able to put it down until you finish the 5th and then you'll just be mad that GRRM is still finishing the 6th one. He creates an amazing world to jump into- it's a page turner even for people who don't rise to the level of some of his most devoted fans or don't consider themselves big on this genre.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|The lenticular packaging is a nice touch. The episodes look absolutely spectacular in high definition. The season play feature is ideal if multiple people are watching the product at different times. The extras are fun if not greatly detailed. The episodes themselves-what can I say? I have watched most of them three times now and still pick up different nuances each time. Simply a magical season of television.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love this show!  It is a must see for everyone. It is very well written and always leaves you<br /> wanting more
B008K8VDPU|3.0|not enough piano keys. I guess I was trying to play it like the one on the ipad. couldn't play same way.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This was a great, fun read. It was a lot of fun to follow the twists and turns and strategies of the different characters. I enjoyed it so much I will probably read again in a few years.
B007Y6OZE0|2.0|I have loved these guys since Smash, but they should have quit after Americana. I thought I would try this cd to see how they are now, def not worth the money. Their style now is just not good.

B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Was waiting for this album since he auditioned! I was a huge fan right away and followed him all season. Phillip is an amazing talent. Sings with such passion and his album is directly that! So happy w it I listen all day.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|If your a fan of the series I advise purchasing the seasons on DVD or BluRay so you can have them on hand at anytime and also who doesn't want to have a marathon of SoA with their family.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the extended forecast! Find it interesting to keep track of accuracy of it. You also have the ability to add multiple locations. Best of all its free!
B004EK91LQ|5.0|This was a wonderful movie, with a mix of genres. Excellent for girls night or with your gentleman, or even just the family
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Murakami is a master of his craft, and this is further evidence of it. The more I read his books, the more I like him.
0345350499|5.0|She was practically in tears when I brought this into her she says it is her favorite book on King Arthur and that it is a must read for those who want to know more on him. She is very critical with her reading so for her to say that it's beautifully written leads me to believe that it must be fantastic.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|This album is even better than their first!  I love it and can't stop listening!  Angels is an amazing song

B003NWS5AO|2.0|I find it interesting that both Brian Wilson [of The Beach Boys], and Robert Plant [late of Led Zeppelin], have both heard the voices of distant ghosts in the summer of 2010, and have returned to re-explore and reexamine their birthrights.  These two great artists have heard the calling, or perhaps musical and physical mortality, looming just around the corner, is demanding that they take stock of their youthful musical expressions though older, perhaps wiser, and hopefully more mature ears.  Is the idea to share something unexplained with their fans, is there unfinished business they feel compelled to complete, or is there something more sinister afoot?<br /><br />While Brian finds a new footing for his first love, the songs of Gershwin, rebuilding them, remodeling them, and constructing a new vision that brings them up to date, Plant seems to get lost in his trip through the past darkly, revisiting his old haunts with nothing more than superstar status.  This is where one sees the aspects of genius in the full light of day.  Brian Wilson is undisputedly a genius, but he doesn't linger on his past, his past is merely a marker, an aspect onto which he's cast a new shadow, bringing us something bright and interesting, and while his vision of Gershwin may not be something one would play everyday, it certainly displays a passion for all that's beautiful, carrying forth Wilson's harmonic music journey ... completing a circle so to speak, connecting the dots, and giving his fans an \\"Ah Ha\\" moment.  And while I many not be able to see the colours in Gershwin that Brian claims to see, this outing is nothing but fresh and satisfying.<br /><br />On the other hand Plant presents an almost matter of fact lack luster tot down memory lane, where he snatches a bit of this and a bit of that, tying them all together with a rather loose knot, called Roots Music.  He ventures into both blues, country and gospel, and while his vocals are compelling, reminding us of his golden god days as the front man for the biggest band of the last century, he fails to capture what he's set out to find, connecting no dots, showing us nothing of his past, other then the title Band Of Joy, a nod to the name of his first group.  He claims that he left Band of Joy feeling that there was some unfinished business, and be assured, he may have had a vision, but he was not able to bring it to fruition, nor does it stand the light of day, bleaching rather easily into obscurity.  Like Wilson's release, this is something you will seldom play, and unlike Wilson's, there is nothing here for you to point to or fire the imagination ... yet alone, give you an \\"Ah Ha\\" moment of joy.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesleras the front man for the biggest band of the last century, he fails to capture what he's set out to find, connecting no dots, showing us nothing of his past, other then the title Band Of Joy, a nod to the name of his first group.

B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Great purchase. Easy to access. Fun experience. Toy story is truly a Disney classic. My four-year-old who has been diagnosed with autism loves watching it over and over. It has given him ideas for play and allowed me to expand on his learning.

B008A5H78K|4.0|I was sitting at my Grammy's enameled kitchen table starring off into the backyard, the fireworks from a week before were still a memory, I hadn't opened Waiting For The Sun yet, I was too lost in the cover, too lost in my own thoughts.  I had odd apprehensions about the album, but perhaps these were just projections of my own inner thoughts, flashes of demons yet unheard ... and very much unseen.  I hadn't told anyone that I'd enlisted in the Army, I certainly hadn't told anyone that I'd requested to join the ever swelling ranks that were building in Vietnam, but you know, as my Grammy pulled a pack of L&M's from the pocket of one of the countless aprons she forever wore, she asked me with a knowing smile, \\"Are you gonna play that, or have you developed a system for divining the music?\\"  I laughed, I loved my Grammy, she had a way of putting things that I've never forgotten, and living here in her home, sitting at the same enameled kitchen table some forty plus years later, it's like it was all yesterday ... and I remember thinking that I may have done something foolish.<br /><br />The Doors were both in and of their time, and more than any other band, created and reacted to the social structure of these times.  Mind you, this was the summer of 1968, Flower Power was a distant memory, Peace and Love had turned to violence ... one of Owlsley's [the man who made ALL of the LSD] distributors had been murdered, much harder drugs were making the scene, General Nguyen Ngoc Loan, a high level Vietnamese Security Officer is captured on film executing a Viet Cong Prisoner, Pinkville [My Lai] erupts, Martin Luther King is assinated, Andy Warhol is shot, Robert Kennedy is also shot and killed ... and here before me stand The Doors, waiting for the sun.  Though if you were to ask me today, I'd have to say that the sun is setting behind them, and they're merely waiting on the next something/anything to rise, and why shouldn't they, things were moving so fast then that nothing was impossible ... but today we know that not to be true.<br /><br />\\"Hello, I Love You\\" opens the disc, it's one of those songs Jim penned years before, and you either instantly love it, or you hate it.  For the most part the album is filled with more pop hits than one would expect from The Doors, but if you're patient, there's also a tenderness found here, a dichotomy, and juxtaposition between rock and jazz that's perfectly balanced for an album that for the most part is entirely overlooked, probably due to the enigmatic nature of several of the songs ... never the less, it's a rare chance to glimmer some of the visions that floated through Morrison's head.  In many ways, this was one of the last counter culture records to chart this highly ... and if I may climb way out on a limb, it was the release of L.A. Woman that ushered in that sweeping California sound that would own the airwaves for the next ten years.  Proving once again that The Doors not only reacted to the times, but were responsible for creating them.<br /><br />So there sat Grammy and I, my little portable record player on the kitchen table, the tonearm found the opening groove with a pop, and Waiting For The Sun filtered through the room to the smell of Grammy's L&M's.  What I took from that album is mostly a memory, I can't remember the last time I played it ...  I do know that despite what Morrison said, he never took over, he copped out and died, and me, I was headed to a land were the young had both the guns, the numbers, and the best dope in the world [\\"Number\\" being slang for a joint].  Regardless, The Doors look rather tired and old on the cover, mere ghosts of the young men who only two albums before, rocked a summer and blessed the world with \\"Light My Fire\\" ... yet even with all of that, this is a damn fine album, and I'm gonna reconcile it's lack of play this afternoon, while thinking about my Grammy.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesleras impossible ... but today we know that not to be true.<br /><br />\\"Hello, I Love You\\" opens the disc, it's one of those songs Jim penned years before, and you either instantly love it, or you hate it.

B008JEJPSC|2.0|I can't complain much, however, the Laserdisc was pan and scan, the DVD was pan and scan and later on released in letterbox. Yet another favourite available in proper aspect ratio albeit the nothing-special transfer

B0002NIRIC|3.0|I used to buy a product called &#34;Doc Farley's String Sudser&#34; I've never had anything that rejuvenated guitar strings like that.  I was hoping this would be similar but it's not as good.  It works ok to remove some oils but it doesn't make them like new. Oh well. The other stuff was probably toxic but it sure worked.
B003FK8V7G|4.0|Even though you've owned the album forever, one day you will hear American Slang like you've never heard it before, suddenly one day it will make sense, you'll look at your sleeve and wonder how long you've been wearing your heart there, and the warmth of these rockin' three chord bits of hard driving emotional sensations will have you dancing carefree in the midnight breeze ... understanding each and every star, understanding the nature of every heartbreak you ever felt, wanting to reach out and caress the faces of all those who said you weren't lucky, and smile into their eyes while saying, \\"I'm still standing.\\"<br /><br />There's a nervous energy to the album, like you're hoping to get lucky, but even if you don't, it's alright because you feel so fine it doesn't matter.  American Slang takes its time to unfold, slowly drawing back the curtains, ushering in the ghosts of early Bruce Springsteen, and a sophistication that The Clash may have developed had they not imploded just when we needed them most.  American Slang is brilliantly honest, an album for every man and woman who ever cried in the dark, and wished to strip away the pretenses, wash their faces clean, and stare off into the future without blinking.<br /><br />So feel your heart beating, run your fingers though the hair of someone you love, kiss them hard and quick on the lips, turn up the volume, roll the top down ... and discover despite everything, that you are lucky, and that the world belongs to you, as long as you're forever relentless.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B0096HNDXY|2.0|I love Kylie, I love the songs, but as an ex-music producer who have worked at Abbey Road studios, these recordings arrangments are nothing special and some of the recordings (especially Never Too Late&#34; ) arebelow par of the typical Abbey Road recording quality. What a waste of money.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie with the family, see how a character that believe he is an evil person but in reality he just never got the attention he deserved until these 3 little girls comes into his life.

B003OJBWGK|3.0|This is not an album you want to take seriously on any level ... though having said that, this is not an album you can avoid on any level either.  Crazy For You is a stunning collection of lo-fi jangle boy-crazy pop songs presented in a lushly upbeat manner, filled with enough sweet \\"ooohs\\" and \\"ahhhs\\" to give give you a sugar rush, harking back to the girl groups of the 50's and 60's, when the ladies stood up and proclaimed their undying affection for summer, and the love of their boyfriends.<br /><br />Of course back then the girls didn't play their own instruments, nor did they have tattoos ... what they do have in common is a passion for catchy tunes, hooks that unshakably float in your head, and songs that exist somewhere between disappointment, and the agony of life.  At 59, the numbers are a bit shallow, but then the days of peering over an open school locker door, or around the corner to catch a glimpse of the guys smoking at lunch, was a very long time ago.  Though in the same breath I must confess that the smile Best Coast has given me, reminds me how utterly brilliant life was, before things turned serious, and these silly emotions slipped between my fingers like so much summer sand.<br /><br />There's only one real sin you can commit, and that is to have forgotten what it was like to be young and in love ... luckily Crazy For You is out there to remind you.<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler

B003HC8I5M|1.0|Here's the reason not to purchase another Phil Collins album: From \\"Take A Look At Him Now,\\" by Deborah Solomon of the New York Times Magazine ...<br /><br />Deborah: A couple of years ago you suffered some damage to your left arm and hand because of a neurological problem, and you're left handed.<br />Phil: At my age things start wearing out.  While I was doing the record I had to tape the sticks to my hand, using Gaffer tape.<br />Deborah: I wouldn't think you would have good control using taped on sticks.<br />Phil: I didn't, I can't play anywhere near like I used to, and I was a hot drummer.  It doesn't bother me, because frankly, if you get to that point where you can't hold a drumstick properly, there are many other things in life which are far more important, like cutting a loaf of bread or a piece of cheese. I don't care about the music as much.<br /><br />I just knew he didn't really care ...<br /><br />Review by Jenell Kesler
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|perfect gift for my  5 year old granddaughter, she was so excited it has a back seat. It is different then the standered Barbie cars. Yes, I would recommend this toy, it was her favorite gift for her birthday.
B00AHSINKO|1.0|Server could not keep up.  Had to reorder on Itune. Movie was great!  Not only does the Amazon VOD service completely @#$%, they wont let you post a bad review of their service.  I guess I will spend my 2K a year somewhere else.
B0027WNRIG|5.0|a great gift for my husbad, who always wanted this version but never asked for it... thanks so much, blessings
B0049J2CKE|5.0|At least this is the most memorable.  Sweet and about good cookin which I always love.  I don't agree that rats would make good cooks though.
B0015AARJI|3.0|Controller did not come with a USB charging cord. This is very disappointing. Now I have to buy an cord to charge my controllers at the same time. Other than that the controller works great.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|I purchased this because I saw a short preview and was interested in seeing the entire movie. I enjoyed the plot and how it held my interest throughtout the movie.<br />I like Liam Neesom in all of the previous characters he has played and I wasn't disappointed with this role.
B000W9DSVW|3.0|Entertainer and witty. Eleven and Thirteen are engrossing, Twelve is a slam-dunk....Big starcast...excellent performance, Eleven is the best of the three. Can watch with family.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn again pleases with his typically fast moving tale which seems to echo current events with an uncanny pitch.  The dialogue is authentic, the story joins up right after launch, and the follow through does not disappoint.  Little turns and twists add to the great &#34;I'd like to be him, on second thought maybe not!&#34; feeling that lace the Mitch Rapp tales.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Once Upon a Time is a TV series involving many well-known fairy tale characters, an evil curse, and an unwitting savior.  This is a fantastic series for people who grew up with the classic Disney movies and their families.  It takes the stories that we all know so well and updates them, giving the characters more depth and the stories more complexity.<br /><br />In this series, the Evil Queen from Snow White's tale has placed an evil curse upon all the residents of fairy tale land, removing their memories and placing them in our world: a place with no magic and no happy endings.  The emphasis for most of this first season focuses on how and why the evil curse came to be, as well as how Snow White and Prince Charming got together.  The story is not exactly what you would expect.  The show splits its time between the main story playing out in \\"our world\\" and a corresponding story playing out in fairy tale land that gives us more information about the characters.  It really is a fun show to watch, and attempts to give both its heroes and its villains more complexity than they are given in the original stories.  It is also very family-friendly, and I highly recommend it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Lovely packaging for what we consider to be one of the finest political (or any) series. Recommended, and very highly.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|Denzel Washington at his best...strong character, entertaining and thrilling....neat cinematography and background score...must watch for everyone...family movie, can watch with kids.<br /><br />Just loved it!!
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|Great for kids to pass the time, but the story line over all was lacking. Stick with Pixar movies for a better family experience.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I HAD A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH MY PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER.  SHE TOLD ME STORIES OF FAIRIES AND SANTA.  I HAVE LOVED THE POSSIBLILITY OF SANTA ALL MY LIFE....

B005WUHAX8|2.0|I don't understand all the hype about this overpriced case.  I did not have it a week and the clear part of the screen was scratched.  It was visible and annoying.  2 or 3 weeks later  another scratch appeared.  I bought this case because it was not as bulky as other cases and would slide into the cell phone pocket of my purse with ease or I could slide it in my jeans pocket.  I don't know how it got scratched but my main complaint would be with the customer service at Lifeproof.  I contacted them in October about the scratches, they offered to exchange the front part (only...not the whole case).  I had to first send them the defective front.  Once they received it they said they would ship me my new front.  That was over a month ago and the new front arrived today WITH a scratch on the clear plastic part.  I guess this case is good for what it is intended for but I am not clumsy and rarely drop my phone and I keep it away from water.  I have no desire to take underwater pictures.<br /><br />The case is very hard to open when you need to open it and the manufacturer states that the more it is opened the more of a possibility the seal that makes it waterproof will lose it's effectiveness.  Also....I could not ever seem to get the &#34;air&#34; out from the space between my actual iphone and the front cover.  You had to work harder to press icons, numbers, letters, etc. because the front of the case is not flush with the iphone.  There is also a sort of vibration when talking on the phone and I could never get the speaker phone to work with this case.  I could not use it with my car charger as the port will only accept actual Apple plug ins.  If it isn't an Apple charger, you won't be able to plug it in to charge without removing the case.<br /><br />I know there are many fans of this case out there, but it just isn't the case for me and the customer service and trying to get the front cover exchanged was very disappointing.  At one point, Lifeproof sent me an email that said &#34;as you requested your order has been canceled&#34;.  I never canceled the order for the exchange.  I will go back to an Otterbox and just deal with the bulkiness of it but I just like the Otterbox better.hat said &#34;as you requested your order has been canceled&#34;.  I never canceled the order for the exchange.  I will go back to an Otterbox and just deal with the bulkiness of it but I just like the Otterbox better.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|If slots and all of the rooms were available I would rate it higher. Until then, only 3 stars from me.
B008PE9GSA|1.0|seriously..this album sucks.yea,it bad.did i mention that ,o,by the way,this album is crap..and not only that..it really blows.perhaps it would be a good idea to take a pass on this lane attempt at ..what..i'm not even sure what to call it.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Despite the occasional bad language, John Green perfectly pieced the story into a masterpiece. Like his other books, Green told a story that's unforgettable like the characters themselves. Although I don't have lung cancer, or am tied down to a machine all of the time, I was able to connect with Hazel in so many ways.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to sophisticated (and mature) teens. Get this book today! You won't regret it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|too far fetched, poorly written, not at all erotic... too much hype about how this series is causing a 'baby boom' due to 'starving' wives
B009CPES4I|5.0|How nice to finally see a movie that dealt with people over 50. An outstanding cast which also included the young Dev Patel. Highly recommended.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Great graphics and audio. There are times that you can really get into this game and loose tract of time. A lot of fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Use Evernote on several platforms. Works great. Stable. Useful. Permissions make sense if you look into what app can do.
030758836X|4.0|A good book and page turner.  I was a little disappointed in the ending.  It felt like the author ran out of ideas and decided to end.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would read this book again. It was very exciting and I could not stop reading it. Can't wait for the second book
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great game. Outstanding graphics and sound  the only problem is that it can be very addictive. the higher games become very challenging.
B0009MAO46|5.0|She loved it.Sent it to my sisters house nice to do.I don't even have to put a thing in here & you ask for more words.
0345803485|2.0|I thought the book was ill written and trashy.  I can't think of anything good to say about it and would not recommend it..
B004GVUPFE|3.0|I downloaded because it was free, but I uninstalled. It isn't the worst game, but I didn't enjoy it.<br /> So, 3 stars.
0979019710|5.0|I have never been a morning person! I'm sure you can relate in some way. Getting up at all let alone early was a struggle every single morning. Notice I said was! Hal's book has not only changed the way I start and end my days, it has changed thousands of others as well! And he's just getting started!! The Miracle Morning is a must read only and I mean ONLY if you want a change in your life. Do you want to become the best person that deep down you know you can be? Do you dream of waking every morning full of energy, spirit, and motivation? Could you just use a pick-me-up in your life? READ THIS BOOK!!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|As a male I thought this book might be slanted to the female reader.  As I got into it it became a must read for both sexes.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|my grandson loves it. gets a little hard at the end. he is seven.  he plays it all the time
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone! Fascinating read about a fascinating man. I felt sad when I completed the book for two reasons: First, the book was done, and second the loss of this incredible person.
B00A77II0U|4.0|It was a cool game, but I wish it had more obstacles.  I'd play it again.  Love the mystery, graphics, and music.
B008N1V11U|5.0|we have reached the promised land. The best game on the kindle. buy it. I definatley got my moneys worth. I cant even use words to describe hoe much I love this game!
B0088O11NU|5.0|Give it a try. Graphics are very good and it requires a soft touch. Really worth the download. Delete if you don't like.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I'll only respond to some of the negative reviews this film is getting by saying you're mad.  Director Christopher Nolan has conceived a brilliant trilogy that reimagined an American archetype and created an epic of monumental proportions.  After the debacle of the Joel Schumacher entries Nolan started from scratch and it feels as though he envisioned this as an open and shut trilogy.  Regardless, considering the film's huge appeal I imagine there will be a few thousand weighing in on its merits so I'll get to my point.  With the Nolan films and its TV and big screen predecessors there has always been opinions about certain qualities probably none more than the role of the Boy Wonder, Robin.  However, one constant there can be no argument about is the role of Alfred the Butler.  The casting of this role has been impeccable from the dapper Alan Napier to the urbane Michael Gough to the more working class Michael Caine.  Alfred has always served as a conduit for the audience as Bruce Wayne/Batman's loyal aide who assists uncomplainingly even if he has reservations about is employer's crimefighting activities.  What I like about Alfred in \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" is he gets to vent his frustrations after years of personal heartache.  It would be less than appropriate that Nolan did not give a smiling Alfred the last image to close out the trilogy.  Yes, this is the last film even if some think that it will continue with Joseph Gordon Levitt's character.
0316228532|4.0|I liked it! I can understand people saying that it was difficult to read due to the many characters. I had to reread the first few chapters to learn who was who, what they do, and who their family members were. It took quite a few pages (over 100) to get the plot. Once I got it, it became easier and I did not want to put the book down. I identified with some of the characters, cheered for some while hating others. I like the fact that the story has no mystery for the reader to uncover. There is mystery within the story however, but the characters are the ones left to wonder and ponder. The reader is not lost trying to figure out anything, we can ride along knowing what's happening. There are some shocking elements throughout the story. It's not a book for everyone. I liked and recommend it.
0671449028|5.0|I loved the story, loved the drawings, loved how the words rhyme, I even bought more books of her, lets see if they are fun too.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|My cousin loves LPS and now she is always playing this game. She was so excited to know got her a game on my Kindle Fire. (I am 13 she is 8) But she really loves this game. I give 5 stars!

0545425115|5.0|The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins was about a girl, Katniss Everdeen, who lives in a futuristic society where kids are forced to fight to the death in an arena. Katniss is chosen to go to the arena. It is for everyone because it is a love story for the girls, but thee is a lot of action for the boys. One of the most prominent conflicts of the story was man vs. society. The government forces kids to fight in this arena and Katniss fights back. The book does a good job at portraying the president as an evil person. Suzanne Collins is making a statement about our own society when she writes about the futuristic society. The rich are able to buy their way out of having their kids chosen to go into the arena. It is unfair how some people are treated like kings while the rest have to live in poverty. Also the oppressive government is an exaggeration of our own. They should not have the right to interfere with peoples lives. Overall I thought The Hunger Games was a great book and I would recommend it to everyone.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game. The further you get into it the more you have to think. I like that.I play several word games....Flow Free provides a good change.
B0055PMURG|5.0|My Special Education students gave this movie their full attention.  Any movie that keeps my students attention over a three day period, and has the students wanting to know more of the story has got to be good.  As a teacher, I've been hoping for a movie version of Bethany's story, since I encountered it in a struggling reader's class.
0316228532|5.0|At times, the black and white, good versus evil themes of the Harry Potter series can make the characterization cardboard-like. That is not the case with The Casual Vacancy. The richly-colored lives of flawed people enable Rowling to create interesting characters. Combined with her compelling story-telling skills, she write her best novel yet.<br /><br />If you're looking for a inspirational book where the hero defeats the bad guy and lives happily ever, don't buy this book. If you'd like to see how a wide range of characters in a small town deal with a series of crises triggered by the disappearance of a hero, you'll love this book.
1452110581|4.0|Cute. I didn't realize the book was so small though. I had it on my desk at work for a while to share with coworkers.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|I really like this game.  It is hard enough to be fun but not so hard you don't want to play at the end of a long day.  Beautifully drawn with a clever storyline.  This is my first game from this publisher but won't be the last.  I'm playing on a Samsung Galaxy Note II, the game runs great but makes me wish my eyes were a lot younger!  Which really, when you think about it, goes to show both the quality of the graphics and the resolution of this phone.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Oh how I wish I had read this when I was younger, I would have been out on the PCT in a minute.  The spiritual path was as important as the physical path.  Read IT!  Great story, slightly anticlimactic.
B003E8GQ76|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Stream quality not too good. Maybe it was my connection, I looked for a way to get a credit because it definitely wasn't HD quality
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Acting was good, plot, and setting were okay. Not terrific but &#34;okay&#34;. Somewhat gruesome to some. Too bad Gary was not in more of it
0446580848|1.0|I can't believe it! Several of the novels I've recently read (or tried to read) from previously \\"can't miss\\" authors have been all missing by a lot, and this one is no exception. To use a football analogy, if The Lion's Game was a touchdown, The Panther was like fumbling and losing the ball on your own one yard line. I tried and tried, but I just couldn't get past the first 6 discs (I listened to the book as read by Scott Brick, who does a perfect smartass John Corey).<br /><br />My first problem was that the plot, thin as it was, also bordered on the ridiculous. Come on! Would the United States government really send a husband and wife team to an extremely hostile territory to be used as bait to draw out a homicidal maniac? Geez, I certainly hope not!<br /><br />Other than that the story itself never really got off the ground. It just dragged on and on as we were treated to lengthy dissertations about Yemen's history, its culture, its backwardness, its misogynist attitudes, and much much more. In fact, I learned much more about Yemen than I ever cared to know. And while I can understand and appreciate the need for the background for a setting few know anything about, this began to seem more like page filler to me.<br /><br />Finally, Corey's sarcastic comments, both to himself and others, which I loved in The Lions's Game, and in a couple other Corey novels (which were done superbly on the audio versions by Scott Brick), began to seriously grate on my nerves. At times it became downright painful to listen to! I mean Ibuprofen painful!<br /><br />So while I'm not ready to give up on DeMille completely -- hey, the guy can write some \\"can't put it down\\" great stuff -- I'm just going to pretend that I never tried to read this loser. So, has anyone written The Jaguar yet?
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire is solitaire.  This is a good version.  I have been playing on random deal most of the time, and it is a hit or miss if I can win, like it should be.
B009369Z8A|4.0|I liked the move a lot - saw it in the theater too. Had problems with the Blu-Ray though.  There were seven or eight spots with the picture paused or jumped.  There was also one spot where the movie froze altogether.  For this reason, I'm going to return it.  I highly recommend the movie though.  Warning - lots of violence!
B00008L3U1|1.0|this order says it was shipped in October and I still have not received my product! very disappointed! bad service
B0031QNDUO|5.0|I am a &#34;baby-boomer.&#34;  This classic movie takes me back to fond memories of my family's tradition of watching it on TV at Christmastime when I was a child.  But this is a wonderful heart-warming family movie for any generation.  I was very happy to be able to purchase this movie inexpensively online and watch it immediately.  It is also nice to have it was part of my movie collection to watch anytime I wish.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|I enjoyed the movie, but by the time it was half over, you knew exactly what was going to happen next.  And why does it sound like a gunshot goes off every time the wolves attack?  Just to make you jump in your seat I think.  The plane crash was not quite as realistic as I was told it would be.  Having said that, I still enjoyed the movie, it' a decent way to spend a Saturday night while eating a bowl of popcorn.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|I happened to be browsing Amazon's $5 MP3 album deals and I stumbled upon this album. I had not ever heard of Rebecca Ferguson at this point, but upon seeing the 5 stars this album has, I thought that I would check her out. I listened to the samples of her songs here on Amazon and watched some of her music videos. I was instantly intrigued and immediately bought this album. This album is worth MUCH more than I paid for it! Rebecca's music is true SOUL music. Her voice and musical style are both rarities in the music industry these days, which is why I appreciate them so much. This album is what I like to call an &#34;all inclusive&#34; - it has every tempo and type of music and song that one could need. Wonderful album and wonderful artist!
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|A buddy of mine raved about this movie. I watched it and was disappointed. Great actors and decent plot but the movie developed very slow. The climactic scenes were short. Basically, it could have been way better given the subject matter and actors.
0545265355|5.0|Worth reading before you see the films! Nice box set - like hardback format. Can't beat the price of the set
B008UFUOH6|4.0|Tracey Thorn of Everything But the Girl was one of the classier voices to emerge from British pop music of the 1980s. It took just one NPR feature to get me to add her gorgeous new CD release \\"Tinsel and Lights\\" to my small Christmas music collection. There are two compelling original songs -- \\"Joy\\" and \\"Tinsel and Lights.\\" Artists covered include  Randy Newman, Joni Mitchell, Sufjan Stevens, and Dolly Parton. The one traditional tune -- \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" -- gets a heartfelt rendering. Besides the original tunes, favorites include Jack White's softly driving \\"In the Cold Cold Night,\\" which gives an uptempo respite, and \\"Taking Down the Tree,\\" which has a dreamy psychedelic afterglow. The arrangements are spot-on. A perfect disk for an overcast December morning.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This sequal is excellent.  I loved the special affects and the story line.  I don't want to spoil the story for you, but if you are a fan of MIB you should love this one.
B009HOU672|5.0|If you are on this page, reading these reviews, contemplating the purchase of RECOMPOSED BY MAX RICHTER VIVALDI: THE FOUR SEASONS, then you are probably already as familiar with Vivaldi's masterwork as you are with the back of your hand.  Even if you don't think you're familiar with it, you probably are, simply because The Four Seasons is practically everywhere: it's the music you listen to when on hold, on the elevator, broadcast over shopping mall sound systems.  It's one of the most recognizable pieces of music in the Western canon.  As much as I love The Four Seasons, it has lost some of its luster simply because it is so omnipresent.<br /><br />Well, Max Richter has changed all that for me.  In this album, he has cracked the beautiful egg that is The Four Seasons wide open, and spilled its dazzling contents for all to see.  And what an amazing experience it is to listen to this great work through his sensibilities.  I love this album, and through it, I have gained a new appreciation for an old favorite.

B0031RSA24|1.0|Professor Dawkins fails on so many levels with this attempt to discredit the idea of God. He focuses almost exclusively on the Christian idea of God, however fails to actually develop a cogent argument against any of the foundational theological concepts of the faith. He clearly has a fear of dealing with Jesus and the theology that goes with Him.<br /><br />The book is also written in a tone which conveys an air of superiority and arrogance which is not appealing to read, and which reflects poorly both on Dawkins and on the institution he represents.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an excellent read.  I have just gotten into Mars sci-fi stories and picked this up on a random reccomendation.  I am so glad that I did.  The author does an excellent job with everything, but what struck me as the most wonderful was resourcefullness of the main character.  I stayed up way too late two nights in a row, draining my Kindle battery to finish it.  I hope to see more from this author soon.<br />Just a side note, there were many laugh out lound funny parts without taking away from the tension of the story.

It's a way to ensure that you develop and have the correct mindset along with the correct skillset to reach your life potential.<br /><br />Hal reiterates a few proven principles and introduces his personal methods. The Miracle Morning is not theory. It's the way Hal emerged out of his \\"black hole\\" in life and how countless others (including me) have and will do the same.<br /><br />The Miracle Morning is an excellent book, but like anything else in life, you have to DO what is layed out for you, for it to do anything in your life. Fortunately Hal Elrod lays it out simple enough with practical action steps so you can. He also provides several resources for your ongoing journey.<br /><br />I'm grateful to have found and read The Miracle Morning and to have met Hal Elrod. Read this book, do what it says, change your life.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|You will be amazed at what this can do.  It is like having an advanced scientific/graphing calculator which can answer questions, not just calculate.

B009SIE6AA|5.0|What is there to say about this unique singer?  Soothing and mellow to the ears.  Perfect holiday music to play in the office.
B009K45Y62|5.0|This is my favorite Blu-ray that I own.I had to get it because this is the last of the Nolan Batman movies.Even though I prefer The Dark Knight as my favorite batman movie,this is still a great conclusion to a trilogy.But my only issue with this set is how the disc are package on top of each other with nothing to protect them from being scratch. But other than that this Blu-ray set is something that batman and movie fans a like should have in their collection.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Who would think that he would be think would morp into a sexy lounge singer.  Yes, I think you're sexy... LOL

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this and cannot wait for the next one to come out!!  That is the only down fall...several more months to wait!
B00555X8OA|4.0|This is an excellent presentation of thinking skills needed in any profession.  It teaches how to avoid mistakes based on emotion and cultivates thinking ability.
B004EPZ084|4.0|Movie was hilarious, even though he should of bang her boss like every man should. More better to rent the movie
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The app was slowed down by the appearance of advertisements on the screen.  Kind of anoying.  I upgraded to the add free version.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|This movie has really surprised me from looking into it. Makes me wonder why towards the end of it all
B004HX4RT6|5.0|I haven't play chess for years, and now I know why.  I'm not very good.  I'm looking forward to moving up from the sub-novice level
B009MF5BXK|5.0|One of the best movies I have ever seen. Action packed, with most of my favorites stars too as well. Try watch this movie
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love the game.  My Wife isn't thrilled that I purchased it, so I don't get to play as much as I had before.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This cartoon is an ok movie. Great for the kids to watch and some other people too who watch cartoons
B005R32L66|5.0|I had Android 2.2 and could not do video calls.  Upgraded to ICS and it works.  I've used Skype for a couple of years and this version works well.
B003Y5H5B0|3.0|As mush as Jonah Hill annoys me, this movie was an ok movie. I would rather rent to movie then buying it
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love Lindsey Sterling. This cd is fantastic. I listen to it every night when i go to bed, and i have recommended it to a number of friends for meditation music :) Beautiful and talented Lindsey is fantastic!
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie was great to watch. I would rec. getting this movie and watch it with friends and family and all
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I really wish that it had been a bit better written with maybe more detail? It's missing something but it really is a great love story. Wish there was a sequel!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Can't beat this movie for just pure enjoyment.One of Tim Robbins best roles.Morgan Freeman also outstanding.One of the few times you root for the prisoners in a movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously? I wish someone could explain this to me. I like literotica as much as the next person but this is soooo poorly written. So bland. And goes against everything that bdsm stands for! Literally had to skip parts because they were either repetitive or so repulsively graphic and violent that my stomach couldn't take it!
B008GFI4V8|4.0|Beautiful video and audio transfers!<br /><br />I am disappointed with the packaging thought. Compared to the beautiful DVD digipack, this one is a total disgrace.
0544045203|1.0|This book does not merit 20 words about it.<br /><br />The better story is that the novel Life Of Pi does not exist.<br /><br />Oh, damn. It's still here.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow what novel.  Possibly the best I have read this year. Will make sure to suggest it to friends and family.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Fabulous film, great service! It arrived quickly in perfect condition! Be warned, however, this film may cause strong emotions, be prepared to feel deeply!
B005N0C0JQ|3.0|50% less fattening than Oasis. A well-crafted album that holds together nicely. Just does not grab you like Oasis tunes did. Singing and music are good...maybe he needs brother to get his ire up....maybe they will reunite in future once they do their solo thing.<br /><br />Still, nice to know that real musicians are out there instead of pop crap on radio.
034580404X|5.0|Great stories.  Lots of emotion.  Could not put down. Even though there is alot<br />of sex in these books there is also a very emotional story line.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its better on computer than kindle fire.but its really fun because I like when you get to fly over things and thing I hate is u only play for 14 min. if you didn't unlock the full game. :) :(
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This is app is very easy to use.  It does not seem to have any major glitches.  Twitter mobile is great!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a really good game anyone who likes creative but active games i suggest this game. Also its worth the price
B0094BB4TW|3.0|wish there was a way to &#34;share&#34; posts but I haven't seen a way as of yet. also wish I could save photos to my kindle fire vs.
0345803507|3.0|Being someone who is into the lifestyle this was pretty vanilla but an okay storyline.  I bought the trilogy.  Shipped ontime
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is well written and it is riveting to read even thought I knew the ending.  The Navy Seals are outstanding and what a great job they  did.  It was good to see it all spelled out so clearly and he accounting of the actual event was amazing.
0345803493|3.0|Being someone who is into the lifestyle this was pretty vanilla but an okay storyline.  I bought the trilogy.  Shipped ontime
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I have read most of it twice.  It is excellent in content and I learned so much about the characters developed by these young men.  I also got an idea about the depth that drug addiction can drag a person.  I feel more compassionate toward people who are addicted to anything.  Also, it gave a wonderful testimony of the power of God in changing and strengthening a person caught in this addiction.  It is a book of hope and the power available to those who are motivated by the right forces.  I highly recommend this book.  It would be especially good for young people.
0345803485|3.0|Being someone who is into the lifestyle this was pretty vanilla but an okay storyline.  I bought the trilogy.  Shipped ontime
B0052RDHTM|1.0|I did not finish this book and I deleted from my Kendle.  I do not read trashy love stories.  I like historical fiction that I actually learn something from  reading.  This book was not going in that direction.
034580404X|5.0|Read this book at record speed.. Going to read it again after the holidays when things calm down.  Must read!
B007XNAPUM|5.0|This Kevin Gray cut for Analogue Productions is a must. Far superior to the sorrily compressed CD version. Nice gatefold jacket. There's a controlled richness in the dynamics of the vinyl. No longer are Dolly Parton's vocals sibilanced. Super quiet pressing. Only a single LP for long sides but the sound does not appear compromised.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|omg!!!!!! i luv this book<br />i cant wait for the house of hades!!!<br />hope annabeth and percy survive<br />well bye people
B001UJIMN2|3.0|Stadium Arcadium & Californication received significant vinyl upgrades from Steve Hoffman's 4 LP SA set & Chris Bellman's 2 LP Cali sets respectively. Both albums finally breathed and let's face it: sounded listenable. The original CD of Mother's Milk (not remaster) sounds fine (I haven't heard the original vinyl), so I hoped this vinyl might also be an improvement. Meh! I wish Kevin Gray, Hoffman or Bellman got his hands on this one. The vinyl sounds veiled (I haven't put it through a Spin Clean yet though)and has much sibilance. It's silent...too bad, because I'd likely send it back if it wasn't!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|And tell Barnes and Noble to join the rest of the world in the 21st century. Have both the e book for my phone and hard copy to display on my book shelf.
B000TXNK64|5.0|Find copies of Kevin Gray/Hoffman's Tres Hombres & Fandango! 180g Rhino/Warner pressings somehow.  Better than any versions of these titles I've heard digital or vinyl.  Tres Hombres' guitar-bass-drum sound is as thick and meaty as the vinyl.  So good, so rich.  I certainly would like to hear Gray cut the rest of the ZZ Top catelog.
B00979CS50|5.0|Old Black just screams at thejoy of being let loose from the barn on this one. Greatest work with Crazy Horse yet.
B00000JQ0E|4.0|For those of you who think the CD sounds fine, you have questionable hearing!  The CD version is possibly the worst atrocity of the digital age.  This new vinyl illustrates that it didn't have to be that way.  I can actually turn up the volume on the vinyl!  It's still not great like the 4 LP version of Stadium Arcadium, but it's highly listenable compared to the crap on digital.  Make certain to get the version with the blue sticker on the front proclaiming limited edition 180 gram vinyl 2 disc set.  It is available via amazon.ca, but I don't know which copy Amazon.com ships
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really love this game. But I'm having trouble getting upgrades to happen. I want to do the goals and get referred to someone who can help thxx.
B007XNAQ42|5.0|It's disappointing how compressed Norah Jones' CDs are. Her music is so organic, but the CDs sound poor. Get these Analogue Productions vinyl versions before they are gone. Easily the best Norah Jones' releases. Finally the music sounds amazing. Beautiful packaging. Don't be afraid of the price...you get what you pay for. These are the only versions anyone needs. Silent & flat platters. Only 1 record which makes for long sides, but the sound does not appear compromised.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Nice low key album to listen to while you're having a dinner party, cleaning the house, lazing around. Not sure I'd recommend it for an upbeat party but it's definitely worth the purchase. At $5 for the album, it's also half the price that it is on iTunes!
B002YCVWXQ|5.0|Best acting of Brad Pitt's career.  Every aspect of this film is excellent, from the script (story & dialogue), to the casting, acting, cinematography, sets, costumes, etc, etc, etc.  This film captures the fell of the time & place yet offers a fresh perspective on what could (and arguably should) have been.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This was a fun movie with lots of action.  The plot could have been better, but maybe in expendables 3
B007UWBQEU|5.0|I've been listening to this album over and over again for weeks! I never seem to get tired of it. There are so many good songs that it was well worth purchasing the whole thing instead of just the few songs that I was familiar with.
B009G78EE2|4.0|Bought this album after seeing a few positive reviews on other sites. Definitely worth the money. The album takes you on a very interesting ride. &#34;Can't Hold Us&#34; makes you want to get off your butt and be more than you are. &#34;Thrift shop&#34; simultaneously pokes fun at and supports the hipster approach of discount shopping. &#34;Same Love&#34; well, this is by far one of the most important tracks to come out in hip-hop in quite some time. There are several other tracks that add to the depth of the album (including Jimmy Iovine) but i won't go into too much detail on them right now. Just know that if you're looking for a new yet somewhat familiar approach to hip-hop then this is album should be one for your collection.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another gem by Mr. DeMille. What a great story and true-to-form, there are some unsolved issues that make you think about a follow-up book!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really like it. just not all the FB posting. and having to by everything you want with your own money. they don't give you enough game money.
B009SQOGZ2|2.0|I Guess This Is the New Normal, Beware<br /><br /> The movie was filmed well the technical aspects were top notch.  However it was very crude and tasteless throughout.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|After reading perhaps hundreds of reviews throughout the web I finally bought one of these to use with my Canon SX40.  I am very happy with it but, like many reviewers say, it DOES require practice and it DOES require patience.  The best advice I found for using it was (1) set the zoom to 100mm equivalent, (2) get about 5-6&#34; from your subject, and (3) use manual focus but because the depth of field is SO shallow for the Raynox, physically move the camera in and out just the slightest to achieve focus. I am also restricting my ISO to 200-400 to keep the image as clear as possible. Oh, and although the Raynox doesn't require an adaptor to use on my Canon, I had bought a step-down ring for something else and prefer using it w/the Raynox--it gives the Raynox clip-on a little more to grip onto. I don't like the lens cap that comes with the Raynox so purchased a 49mm Fotodiox Inner Pinch Lens Cap from Amazon and love it (see that review also).
B00A77II0U|5.0|Awesome! $2.99 I have spent for a game in a long time! Hope Alawar makes more like this, defiantly made me a big fan!!!
B00A23MYCC|2.0|The movie is ok, not comedy gold.  Honestly it's just not that funny or clever.  It's a bit of a Wilfred ripoff, but with less complexity in the characters and storyline.  If you're looking for something with even a little depth in the comedy, this is not your flick.  If all you want is simple, surface-level jokes and puns, this movie would likely be a perfect substitute for Scoobie Doo while smoking a bowl.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all the Rapp books and waited for this one with bated breath.  Vince Flynn is the greatest and I pray he does well and does  not give up.  Dec. 06 I was diagnosed with a deadly Leukemia, Acute myelogenous leukemia and my daughter was told I would live approximately 2 months due to my age and the serious disease,  I actually had 78% of my bone marrow was blast (cancer).  Prayers started going up from the Wailing wall, Mormans, Methodists, Lutherans, Babtists, Church of Christ, Catholic every holy site know to any of us and viola see what prayer did; this past month my oncologist told me they actually consider me Cured with no more chance for Leukemia to come back to me than to any other person.  What a miracle PLEASE PASS THIS HOPE TO MR. FLYNN.  Thank you the book is great as usual.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Another great hit from Abercrombie. Now I can't wait for the next trilogy. I have a feeling that Logan, Bayaz, and the whole gang will be there for the last showdown.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|This is a great app for anyone who loves Wikipedia as much as I do. It makes viewing Wikipedia articles optimal for my device.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|Where it all began. Amazing movie with a great two movies following.  The last movie (Dark Knight Rises) relates back to this movie a couple times so good idea to see this one first.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|A great fast action movie.  I also caught a drift of the current class warfare where the government is pitting the poor & middle class against the rich.  Bruce Wayne shows that many rich people do very good work that those without the means  & money cannot do.  The evil Bale thought he was bringing &#34;justice&#34; to the people but it was really anarchy & chaos.  A good reminder to America, if we all got justice, we would all be dead.
0470474874|5.0|This includes just about everything you would ever want to know how to do in Excel.  Good instruction and easy to look up as I have already used a few ideas on my spreadsheets.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|i love the quick download and convenance of this service...i just didn't like the movie...it was just unremarkable...but i thought it was well acted
0345803507|5.0|I liked this Trilogy, just like everyone who usually reads Romantic Fiction, you want to be in a world of 'if it were me' and dreaming that maybe this just could happen to me.  I thought they were well written, believable with great characters and dialogue.<br /><br />Recommend it highly.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This is my second movie that I have tried with Prime. Great movie and the fact that I get to see it before the DVD hits mailboxes was a nice bonus.
0345803493|5.0|Loved It. Recommend reading all three books. Story line is great and it's a good read and re-read.<br /><br />Recommend it.
0446573027|4.0|John Puller, our hero, think Jack Reacher but still in the service, Criminal Invesigation Division.  He is a little too distant for me, not much emotion, but then again, neither does Reacher.  ZERO DAY is a fast paced complicated novel.  A reader needs to stay focused.  Not a bad Baldacci.  RECOMMENDED
0345803485|5.0|I was surprised that I enjoyed this book, it went into some areas I wasn't familiar with but not in a raunchy sort of way. I enjoyed reading the whole trilogy it was entertaining and well written.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|Truly just a fun, entertaining movie ... Terrific cast, story and musical score. The movie hums along at a fun pace. Worth checking out!<br /><br />Gaiman + Vaughn = WINNING
0812550706|5.0|This book was great, especially for the value. I recommend you read its sequel (Speaker for the Dead) and then immediately stop. The series goes downhill after that, with the 3rd one being one of the worst books I have ever read. I didn't bother to read the 4th, but I've been told they get even worse.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I enjoyed seeing how it all started. Love Roberts humor and acting style. The kids really enjoyed it with us.
B003WQT2YY|3.0|I am giving it 3 stars becasuse the movie itself is good, but feel the &#34;additions&#34; in the Director's Cut, foul language and nudity, actually detract from the movie.  The version shown in the theaters is much better.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It seems Vince Flynn books are as great as ever. If you are considering reading this, do not pass it up. I really enjoyed it from start to finish. Mitch Rapp continues his war on terror even after he is seriously hurt. You don't want to miss this one if you have read the previous novels. If not, start with the earlier ones but they are all great, and this is one of the best. I am glad I read it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good plot but dragged out ad infinitum.  The Racketeer is not a good title...should be called The Con Man.  Or The Pot of Gold.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love playing mystery/adventure games and this one is great. I enjoyed how the game lasted a while and wasn't short. I cant wait to continue the adventure!
B002PZC8BM|5.0|The writers of this show did a really good job.  They don't insult your intelligence by telling you what everything means along the way, and the protagonist isn't a flawless pretty-boy.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|My son is a HUGE Minecraft fan, so I was excited to find this Lego set as it would be like winning the toy lottery for him.  Initially I could only find it on Amazon for about double the MSRP.  Even though I was a little temped to buy it, I did not out of annoyance that the sellers holding it were blatantly price gouging.  I should not have been surprised then to find out that it is now almost 4 TIMES the MSRP.  It's already not one of the most value for money Lego sets (it's tiny, and will take him about 10 mins to build probably) so the actual sale price is even pushing it, but to expect people to pay that much for what amounts to a handful of plastic is ludicrous.  I've noted the names of the sellers and will not be buying any toys from them in the future.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is the usual addictive, challenging game, but without some of the neat special effects of the Space, Rio, Star Wars, or even Seasons game.  If I had to restrict myself to only 2 or 3 Angry Birds apps, this wouldn't be on the list.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|There's too much of a commitment to play, IMO.  If you don't come back near the specified time the meal is ruined and you have to throw it away.  While this works with Facebook games, not always is a tablet something I get on regularly.  My daughter played it some but I had to keep logging on to snag the food for her or she would never have any dishes completed.  It felt more like work than a fun game to me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the point of view changing constantly. She is very good at keeping the reader hanging till the next time the character came into play. Definitely recommend it.
0547884591|5.0|Disclaimer: I am a real reviewer who actually purchased and read the book.  I felt compelled to write my first review because I was annoyed in two ways: first, the clearly fake reviewers, second, the readers who came in with ridiculous expectations about the contents of the book.<br /><br />Second disclaimer: I am NOT a Tim worshiper.  The 4-Hour Workweek is a sometimes unethical pipe dream that a couple people writers imitating Tim have made money on.  For most of us, it contains a couple tricks to be more efficient at our 9-5. The 4-Hour Body is a relatively interesting and fun book on fitness and diet experimentation.  I learned a few tips and tricks from it and really enjoyed reading about his experiences.  I have read most of Tim's blog and consider it a sometimes better alternative to \\"Life Hacker\\".<br /><br />Those two disclaimers being said, this is a GREAT book if you come in with the right expectations.  If you're looking for 600+ pages solely devoted to grocery shopping, prep, recipes, cooking and eating, you will not find it here.  You'll find about 200-250 pages dedicated solely to such, and 200 more at least somewhat related--consisting of wilderness cooking and survival, great restaurants, 140 character recipes, and basic tools you need in the kitchen.  At a macro level, the most useful cooking lessons are Tim's notes on equipment to have in your kitchen, his 10 easy recipes (most of which are really interesting/easy shortcuts), and the charts on spices that go with different countries.  At a micro level, I picked up a few random tidbits from the 1/2-pagers on how to quickly defrost a steak, how to make the perfect cup of coffee, etc.  The most important part of this section is that Tim teaches you HOW to cook, not just how to follow a recipe.  The best part about his methodology is that he removes all roadblocks from the reader--the excessively expensive equipment, the hard to find ingredients, and the difficult cooking techniques are all put nicely out of mind with shortcuts and detailed pictures.<br /><br />The rest of the book, in my opinion, is actually more interesting.  The first section is about a hundred pages are worth the price of admission alone.  It details a method to learn anything efficiently--Tim is merely using cooking as a MEDIUM to teach this method.  I've started applying this first section to learning a number of skills already.  As the middle sections are the ones devoted to cooking and wilderness survival that I detailed above, the appendix is related to random skills and interesting \\"life hacks\\" that you can learn quickly.  Yes, these feel like last-minute additions but if one thing is clear Tim actually cares about his readers, why not throw in these interesting pages--they do not detract from the focus as they are part of the appendix.<br /><br />If I can say one thing--buy this book.  For me, I can see myself going back to it for years anytime I'd like to learn a new skill (be it with cooking or otherwise).  If you want to learn HOW to cook taught in an unpretentious tone with easy to follow pictures, you'll find it here.  If you're interested in shortcuts to learning complex skills, you'll find it here.  If you just want to pick up a few cooking shortcuts, you will most definitely be delighted with this book.  And lastly, if you are a fan of Tim and his other works, absolutely buy this book.<br /><br />Lastly, a note on format, BUY THE HARDCOVER.  I bought the Kindle as well since it was on sale for just $4.99 on Amazon and it does not even come close to comparing to the hardcover version.  This book is meant to have pages cut out and marked up, its detailed color pictures to be seen, etc.out of mind with shortcuts and detailed pictures.<br /><br />The rest of the book, in my opinion, is actually more interesting.

B003O86FMW|5.0|this book is amazing . I give it a 20 out of 10. This is a great book.!!!! She is a good book writer.
B005R32L66|1.0|I have a kindle fire and skype wont work with and kindles!  It says it is nopt compatble with the device!  Amazon if youdont get this fixed thee will be alot of returns going to you becuse there are families that want to talk to there loved ones and they cant because they cant use skype to video chat or talk to them!  Please fix the problem immediately.  Thank you!!
0544045203|3.0|That's how many stars this book should get.<br /><br />The life of the digits that make up pi would be more exciting.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|A good story. Couldn't put it down. It was a easy and fast read. Made me think, plus it's sweet.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Wife loves it! The duets make a subtle but good transition between songs. It is a nice addition to our holoday albums.
B0063IH60K|5.0|non invasive ads, good range of options, not glitchy. solid app. would recommend to anyone looking for a free, basic time killer.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Nice story if you want to see what makes up the life of  one guy totally committed to protecting the nation in his own way.  He readily admits that the &#34;head shed' i.e. the superior officers is a place that he was not a part of nor aspired to be a part of.  So If you are looking for an overview of the war and the strategy, look elsewhere.  If you want one guy's view from the ground you will find this interesting.  If you want the real skinny on sniping this is not it.  If you wonder what makes a guy become a SEAL, do multiple tours in harm's way and balance a wife and kids, you will find one man's answer here.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Probably because my roots are in the navy. For anyone who likes military stuff this would be a good book to read.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|because  robots survey would not get off my screen and this is wasting time that I thought I could save shopping from you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!  The characters capture you and you can readily empathize with them.  Katniss is such a tragic, courageous and human character.  Collins is a terrific author!
B005LAJ212|5.0|I would recommen the DVD.  The Revenge is series is the best.  Excellent story line.  A little disappointed that the Blue Ray format is so expensive.  I purchased the DVD.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I thought it would be fun to reread this book after many years.  I was not disappointed.  It was as engaging as when I was much younger.  Everyong should read this classic.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Jonesy said at a press conference for this movie as to why they waited 5 years to release the movie of the concert done in '07; &#34;Five years is like five minutes in Zeppelin time.  I'm surprised we released it this early.&#34;  LOL!  Worth the wait.  Love the CD's of the concert, the movie, the dress rehearsal, all of it.  Though you can find the original full length newsreel footage on the collectors edition of the 07 release of &#34;The Song Remains The Same&#34;, this footage is the edited length shown at the concert.  My only complaint.  Other than that!  ROCK ON!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a wonderful and very useful app..<br />I highly recommend.  If not for battery pro i would never get to use my kindle.
