B006C45MRE|2.0|I rented this movie due to seeing a preview in theaters. I was expecting an exciting action movie and a terrible story line. Instead you got a mix of a love story, a tale of redemption, a tale of revenge, and a tale of the potential for humanity to be destroyed. And none of these stories were very good. On top of that there is about 30 minutes of action in the entire film. But if you love bad western and bad sci-fi, this might be the movie for you.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|My son in college played me a couple Florence tracks in the car.  Based on those, I bought both her CDs (Lungs and this one) at the same time.<br /><br />I read the low reviews regarding Ceremonials on this site before the purchase, and had my doubts.  Being the 48 year old grumpy misanthropic guy that I am, rarely am I touched in any deep way by modern musical efforts. I prepared for some level of disappointment.<br /><br />Sure, there are a couple tracks that, for whatever reason, don't speak to me as strongly.  But my God - the many wonderful moments of brilliance on this CD are overwhelming.<br /><br />Sometimes in life you come across a thing of such pure beauty, such unmitigated connective joy that it leaves you breathless.  \\"Heartlines\\" is precisely this sort of item.<br /><br />Florence and the Machine have given us all a precious gift.<br /><br />The last time I felt this way was the first time I heard Mary Fahl sing.<br /><br />Conclusion - get the bloody CD.  Worth every penny.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cant go wrong with so many games some are almost impossible pretty cool 5 stars for sure! plus 250000 points for a review
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its great for when you are bored buts the games are pointless most aren't that fun. buts its worth getting if it wasn't free I wouldn't get it though.

B004A8ZWXS|5.0|S.Spielberg gold. He took a long-loved youth's book written in 1982, and transformed it into a film so beautiful it reminded me of the English Countryside painter Thomas Gainsborough 18th century. Having been educated to teach visual art, I was captivated with the continual perfection of composition of very scene, seemingly every frame. I am an avid British film/TV viewer, but `War Horse' cinematography meets the highest of anything I have seen to date. The period sets, scenery, and costuming are perfection transforming the viewer into a time capsule of 1914 to the end of WWI. Stunning aesthetic mastery.<br /><br />Janusz Kaminski must get some credit with Spielberg for the cinematography perfection.<br /><br />I did read the book first and was confident (viewing the film proved me correct) that Spielberg would be true to the book. It's about as close as a film can get to a book. Being a shorter book, written for ages 11-13 originally, and the movie length (146 min) helped provide all of the needed key points of the story of the amazing red bay Joey. One could say plenty about the fine acting but it is the story, and the compelling adventures of the horse, told through the view-point of Joey (akin to Black Beauty) that makes this a must see, and once available, for me will be a MUST OWN.<br /><br />The viewer literally rides through all kinds of situations, some heart wrenching, some heart stopping, some heart breaking, some heartache, while others end heart warming. Is it the horse that has all the heart and pours out from the screen; or is it the mastery of another Steven Spielberg directing/producing production that makes your pulse rise and fall in alarming changes? This is the first film in many a year that actually left me on the brink of tears. The end was so stunning that my wife and I could not move, could not get up and leave during the credits, and that was a plus since the credits footage contain some beautiful music that revives one's spirit after such an experience.<br /><br />Yes, there is warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately. But even the battles were so beautifully filmed. Hats off to anyone on the film involved in the actual work of producing the visual aspect of `War Horse.'warfare, and from WWI books and photos I have seen, and a grandfather's eyewitness accounting, the film shows the war accurately.

B005K17RU0|5.0|One of the best apps for weather you can get. Much better than the TWC app. Has a nice radar and updates at the top.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|but some games are difficult and some you have to buy to unlock due to the difficult ones but all in all it's fun and free :)
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I am very critical when it comes to movies and have never written a review for one, but this movie deserves it.  The story was very strong and believable, the visuals were stunning, the acting was good, and it was just an overall enjoyable experience.  I have watched every Planet of the Apes entity and I am very happy with this one.  I would encourage people to take a walk into the past and watch the other ones...That will make this movie even more enjoyable.  Definitely one of my top ten favorite movies of all time.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I heard the same thing about this book from multiple people...it is really good, but it takes a while for it to get interesting. I found the same to be true when I was reading it. The story gets off to a slow start, so it took me a while to get through the first half. However, you reach a point where everything you have been reading starts to come together in a very exciting way. The second half of the book flies by, and keeps you interested until the last page. The writing is exceptional, which is helpful since it is a very detailed story and you need to keep track of all of the pieces to understand what happens in the end. I would definitely recommend it, but advise readers to stick with it even when it seems like the story is going no where. I am hoping that the next book in the series will be equally pleasing!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Love this movie! Been watching each christmas since I was a kid! Raymond Briggs created something wonderful. I was excited to find it on DVD so I can have it in the future to share with my kids!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|kind of fun. there is a variety of different games. the picture is a bit fuzzy and the game is kind of outdated.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've been looking for Spider Solitaire for awhile. This is exactly what the doctor ordered! So much fun &amp; such relaxing mindlessness! Yay!
1932100660|1.0|There are a lot of claims in this book and virtually no evidence of said same. After I hit upon several claims that just didn't sound right I did a bit of journal research. Turns out that this \\"study\\" has been hauled over the coals for the rubbish it is. No wonder it is a book rather than a peer reviewed journal paper.<br /><br />Here are some lay articles that cover the science:<br />[...]<br />[...]
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book and \\"Fire\\" are terrific.  The story is riveting and characterizations are real and true to life.  I suppose the conservative parent would object but the reality of the characters is instructive to the reality of what their teens are living.  For adults, it's a pleasure to read such well plotted stories where you really do care about the characters.  Love these books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is one of the best things that could have been produced. Thank God for the youversion Bible application. Peace! & Blessings to all.
0553584537|5.0|I was hooked right from the beginning. A guy (police snipper) doing his job is put in the unfortunate position of protecting a wife and child during a domestic disturbance. After blowing the husband away there is the mandatory investigation and other characters that contribute to second guessing and unexpected twists and turns. Well written. Now I'm looking forward to more books by this author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to say, until I saw the preview for the movie I thought this was a general boring war book.  Well, totally wrong! Now I understand why this has been at the top for so long!  What an amazing book.  Love the characters, love the plot.  Read it in almost one night and immediatly bought the trilogy.  LOVE this. LOVE LOVE LOVE.
0810983915|5.0|Continuation of the series.  We have the first grouping of books.  Hope the author continues with this series.  My grandson loves them.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's pretty good, although the games can get boring and I can see that most of them are only meant to be played to get the extra points for the Max score.
0810988941|5.0|This book was in excellent condition.  The series is totally enjoyable to my 7 year old grandson.  He loves reading these chapter books, and the family encourages his reading.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love this app. works great. the only glitch / frustration is with the reading plan reminders. I keep receiving reminders for plans that have already been completed. but it's an annoyance I can live with.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plays very well and it doesn't get in the way.  Good options and colors.  Auto-complete is a great feature, too.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a great game. I would recomend this game to others. As long as the like games they have to figure out themselves. As the games have no instructions.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|games are boring and tedious.  need points to unlock more games which is frustrating.  you also don't get enough points unlocking a.new game and winning it so you must repeat. games
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I can't even begin to describe how much easier this has made my life.  There's a lot of great software for tablets these days but there are still a ton of ways in which they fall short to traditional computers.  Splashtop really fills the gap.  If there' s a piece of software i just HAVE to be able to use and there isn't a good tablet equivelant, I just access my PC remotely and I'm gold.  It's also useful if I've left a file on my system at home and quickly need to upload it somewhere.    I really can't recommend this enough.  Especially for such a great price, there's no reason not to have Splashtop on your smartphone or tablet.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Geeks that spawn from the dawn of geekdom all the way down to geek noobs will all enjoy this book. Even though it's a love letter to an era that was about a decade before my geek prime, there was still plenty to sink my teeth into here. Although this book is largely a work for the initiated, there is still a solid story and universal themes and characters in deployment here. I chose this book because i wanted to get ahead of the curve, trendwise and this book didn't disappoint. I hope the movie gets made and made well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool game totaly epical could not stop playing it you should try it If you have not already tryed it
B000UPSKO8|5.0|Every second of this recording is absolutely superb and sheer delight!!!  The disc is a must for every opera lover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when i played this, i found the games were really fun and varied. the only think i didn't like is the fact that different games cost different amounts of points you've earned through playing different games.
0071762345|5.0|This book does an excellent job of how to build an engaging online social network with your business. They give terrific and simple tips on how to create a conversation with your fans/followers, using FB primarily but also the same concepts can apply to Twitter, Linkedin, etc. All their tips can be applied immediately, which makes the ROI an excellent value. They also provide great ways to add more fans/followers and how to maintain that conversation.   I have several books on this topic and this is the one I refer to the most. Everyone tells you to get fans/followers for you business, to engage, but this book tells you actually how to do it. It's a quick read with immediate returns.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works incredibly.( This my first review for any kind of product.) I am completely amazed. I have officially lost my product review virginity.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was actually kind of fun i really enjoyed it. in most of the games you have to be quick and efficient though!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its an ok game but this game is good for really boring days. and its easy most of the time to beat the games. I recommend it, good cure for boredom . the only reason I'm writing a review is go get points to unlock more games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is pretty cool it has lots of mini games but some of them are quite hard but it still has entertaining ones and some can actually ne confusing
0783229526|5.0|My son had a copy of this, loaned it out and never got it back. It was on his Christmas list. It arrived quickly and in good condition. I would definitely suggest this site to my friends.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it for passing the time away when I'm in class. It's saved me from boredom. I love this app. :]
B002L5GQGY|3.0|Just to clarify; my low review says NOTHING about the artist or the quality of the program.  This is a great DVD of a stunning artist in his prime.  The musicianship, sound quality, camera work and image quality are paramount.  However there is a fuzzy glitch that runs at the bottom of the screen for the duration of the DVD which is driving me crazy.  If it didn't take 5 weeks to reach me I would send it back for an exchange but I don't have that kind of time to waste.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I took a group of friends to see this movie- ages ranging teens to mid-40s, men and women, married and unmarried, children or none- everyone loved it! This movie is a breath of fresh air and portrays a relevant truth about the family unit- With Christ as the foundation of our families we cannot fail.
B0052OWGYW|3.0|The movie would have done well to simply end three minutes earlier. Would have been a more interesting and less cliche ending. As such, it went the same route of most other B Action/Adventure flicks.  Some good moments and no complaints with the acting, script or plot other than mentioned.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game because there is so many different games and options to choose from and it is lots of fun
0525478817|5.0|Hazel Grace has cancer of the terminal variety. There is no cure, no getting better and no chance of survival. But a drug called Phalanxifor is helping to prolong her fight, even if it isn't curing the build-up of fluid that creaks her lungs.<br /><br />Hazel's mum and dad know what a blessing it is to have her with them for just a little while longer. But her lengthened life won't mean much if she doesn't get up off her butt and do something with it. So they send her into the Literal Heart of Jesus (architecturally speaking) - to a cancer support group where people talk and cry, praise the battle-weary cancer kids and repeat stories about losing their testicles to the big-C. It's a hoot.<br /><br />And then one day, while sitting around discussing a cancer survivor's current state of ball-lessness, Augustus Waters walks in, and everything changes.<br /><br />Augustus Waters is currently in remission, minus one leg courtesy of the cancer monster. Augustus has stared death in the face, and laughed heartily . . . and now he continues to chortle. He sticks cigarettes in his mouth but doesn't smoke them. He is a terrible driver. His best friend is about to be blind, and he falls irrevocably and stupidly in love with Hazel pretty much at first sight.<br /><br />But Hazel is reluctant. Augustus has already lost so much to cancer, and she doesn't want to be another grenade in his life (sure to wound) . . . so she tries to resist his crooked smile and general hotness. Just friends, okay?<br /><br />`The Fault in Our Stars' is the new contemporary YA book from astronomically popular Edgar & Printz winning author, John Green.<br /><br />Brace yourselves. John Green's newest book is a love story starring two cancer-ridden teenagers. Yes, it's sad. Yes, it's actually so sad you will blubber while reading and be all snotty by the last page. Expect great big gulping, hiccupping tears. The embarrassing kind. The kind you don't want to shed on public transport. You have been warned.<br /><br />That being said . . . this is a John Green novel, so it's totally worth your crying, blubbering, hiccupping, snotting tears. Truth be told, `The Fault in Our Stars' is down-right magnificent.<br /><br />Our narrator is Hazel Grace Lancaster - terminally ill `cancer kid' whose mortal coil has been somewhat lengthened thanks to a (minor) miracle drug. But Hazel has been sick for so long that she doesn't exactly know how to be normal and just live. She's only sixteen but attending college, having surpassed her classmates studying by herself while being cooped up indoors. She's a quick-witted firecracker of a girl who has side-stepped the brink of death only to become a terminal couch-potato (addicted to `America's Next Top Model'). Her mother, and full-time carer, wants to see Hazel interact with the world. Hence, Cancer Support Group in the Literal Heart of Jesus. Hence, meeting Augustus Waters. Hence inconveniently falling for a cancer survivor who she is bound to hurt and maim when the death-knock sounds for her.<br /><br />**<br />The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,<br />But in ourselves, that we are underlings.<br />  ***<br /><br />Hazel and Augustus grow closer (despite her reservations) when she shares an important part of herself with him in the form of her favourite book, Peter Van Houten's `An Imperial Affliction'. A book famous for ending abruptly, and somewhat incompletely, about a cancer girl and her glass-eyed mother who falls for a rich Tulip Man. But the abrupt ending plagues Hazel, and then Augustus. Peter Van Houten has not written another word in seven years, and has no plans of writing a sequel or answering fan-mail.<br /><br />I loved the story behind `An Imperial Affliction', mainly because it felt like Green putting a little tiny bit of himself in his book - a bit of life imitating art. John Green's first novel was `Looking for Alaska' - a Printz-award winning book that beguiled and surely frustrated many teen readers. Frustrated, because there's a rather crushing death in the book that is never fully explained. No definitive reason is given for a beloved character's passing, and I have read reviews in which people cursed and lamented the lack of resolution at the end of `Alaska' (despite the fact that there's truth in the not knowing). In `Fault', Hazel and Augustus wrack their brains over the abrupt mid-sentence ending of `An Imperial Affliction' - which hints at the protagonist's death, but never confirms it. They become obsessed with the idea of getting the answers from the author, Van Houten himself.<br /><br />I loved this story-within-a-story. It feels like John Green speaking rather directly and affectionately to his readers (but it should be noted that Green couldn't be further from the Van Houten character). Through Hazel's obsession with `An Imperial Affliction', Green assures readers that he understands how important fictional characters can be . . . that they have a life of their own within reader's hearts and minds, and that the author has a certain `contract' to fulfil with the reader by letting them walk into our lives and consume us for a little while. And consume us they do, such is the case with Hazel and Augustus . . .<br /><br />These characters will get to you. You'll wish that they are real people you can hang out with, talk to them and try to keep up with their whip-quick comebacks and banter. You will love them. Augustus is sweet and earnest, a perpetual optimist who goes after Hazel with everything he has. He and Hazel are a riot together - bouncing off each other beautifully, able to sway between deep metaphorical musings and laugh-out-loud repartee. They're both a little bit brilliant. Which is why reading their doomed star-crossed love hurts so much (and will induce aforementioned snotty blubbering).<br /><br />Something I especially love about John Green novels is the abundance of quotable quotes. I come away from a Green reading with many curious thoughts and ideas to turn over in my mind. And since the themes and topics in `Fault' are so expansive - hopeful and morbid, set on epic life-or-death scales - the book is full of heartfelt reflections and pin-point accuracies.<br /><br />Nobody should be surprised to learn that `The Fault in Our Stars' is simply sublime (as we all knew it would be). John Green is exploring a deathly disease with gallows humour and infinite tenderness. It's a total clich&eacute;, but you will laugh and you will cry. And by the end of the book you'll feel a little bit bruised and battered, tender and exposed. But Hazel and Augustus will stay with you for a long while after reading, John Green having fulfilled his promise to the reader that these characters matter; they have weight and substance, and they will not be easily forgotten.

B005IS56CG|5.0|Great metal album from a MAINSTREAM metal band. Let's look at the history of MAINSTREAM metal. You have the old school bands like Black Sabbath. Then in the 80s there was the New Wave of British Metal, like Iron Maiden. Then came the American Glam metal bands, like Warrant. Then we had grunge, like Alice in Chains (not really metal). Lastly you had a resurgence of American metal with bands like Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, and now Five Finger Death Punch. Like it or not, 5FDP is on the same level as these classic mainstream metal bands, and they may even reach the legendary status of Ozzy someday... Buy it or get the F*** out of metal.
B004X8W468|5.0|Miranda is writing a letter. She doesn't know to whom. She doesn't know why. But someone has asked her the location of the spare key. And to explain the day that her best friend, Sal, stopped wanting to hang out with her. Someone wants Miranda to write it all down ... so she is, slowly.<br /><br />`When You Reach Me' by Rebecca Stead was the winner of the 2010 John Newbery Medal.<br /><br />`When You Reach Me' is sort of like the Georges Seurat painting, \\"A Sunday on La Grande Jatte\\". Up close it's just a bunch of tiny, tiny dots - indecipherable and meaningless. But when you stand back, you get the whole picture... and it's kind of magnificent.<br /><br />Stead's novel is set in 1981, and is in part a recollection of her own childhood as a `key kid' in New York. She delves into the curiosities and concerns of many sixth-graders - like losing friends, getting somersault-belly when a cute boy walks past, and facing fears. For Miranda, her biggest fear is the laughing man on the corner street, the man she passes everyday on her way to and from school. He yells out insanities - \\"bookbag, pocketshoe\\" - he calls her new friend an `Angel' and Miranda a `Smartkid'.<br /><br />Miranda's other consuming fear though, is that she's losing her best friend, Sal. They have stopped hanging out, upon Sal's request. A run-in with a bully called Marcus has sent Sal into a sort of hibernation, and Miranda doesn't know what to do about missing him.<br /><br />But Stead's novel is bigger than the sum of its parts, and interspersed with Miranda's narrative about cute boy Colin, and working at Jimmy's sandwich shop, are curious asides to an unknown person who has tasked Miranda with writing a letter. This person wants to know the location of the key to Miranda's apartment. They leave notes for Miranda, foretelling of a Christmas present and her mother's appearance on Dick Clark's $20,000 Pyramid game show. This person also warns Miranda that when they meet, they will not look the same ...<br /><br />And therein lies the true brilliance of `When You Reach Me'. On the surface Stead's novel is an enjoyable recollection of a NYC sixth-grader navigating the torrential waters of growing up and moving on. But there's more ... oh! There's so much more. To reveal would be to ruin a wonderfully plotted semi-mystery.<br /><br />What I liked best about Stead's novel is that it was intended for a middle-grade audience, but also appeals to a crowd much older than that. Through Miranda, Stead explores big ideas through tactful and succinct sixth-grade musings, and it's a delight to get Miranda's view of the world.<br /><br />`When You Reach Me' is nothing short of incredible. When you read it through once, you'll want to go back and read it again - hold the book up in a new light and appreciate the delicacy and interwoven complexity. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.You Reach Me'. On the surface Stead's novel is an enjoyable recollection of a NYC sixth-grader navigating the torrential waters of growing up and moving on.

B005LLSLPE|5.0|If you totally dig SOA then you are now prepared to read or watch Hamlet because you know the story. Young, reflective prince unsure of the foundations of his life's order. Gets a visit by his father's ghost, Hamlet Senior, who helpfully tells him he was murdered by his brother Claudius (probably). The Queen cares more for status and power than doing what's right, so she stands by her (current) man. She worries about her unhappy son: \\"It's like his father is speaking to him from beyond the grave.\\" Then of course there's the title of the manuscript: \\"How SAMCRO Lost Its Way.\\" Truly something is rotten in the state of Denmark.   Agent Stahl, our duplicitous, spying Polonius of this tale, helpfully calls Jax and Gemma the \\"prince\\" and the \\"queen.\\" She gets the Polonius treatment, too, meeting her demise at the end of season 3. And if Stumpy and Half Sack aren't Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, they're Falstaff.   Just in case you weren't clued in by the show's obvious references, Maureen Ashby helps us out from Ireland, by sending more of our ghost's writings so we can hear the voice of John Teller saying \\"Murder most foul...\\"  If the creators of SOA are to be true to the origins of their story, they will acknowledge its greatness by killing Jax Teller at the hands of someone, probably from SOA Belfast Charter or the IRA, avenging his own father's death at the hands of John Teller. We don't really have an Ophelia here though. Jax's old lady is a strong and intelligent woman who chooses to jump in to the mayhem rather than simply being swept along by it. She may be the one, at the end of the story, who acts as Horatio's voice, telling us the sadness of it, what can be learned from it and why we should care as she soldiers on without her best friend.  I sincerely hope we see a full dramatic end to the story, that the characters we love will die bloody or triumph and all will be tied up in a most Shakespearean way.  SOA is by far the best thing I've found in current television production. If you have missed it, get Amazon Prime or Netflix and stream the first three seasons. Do that and I'll bet you'll be back here to buy the fourth.  This is a series to own on Blu-Ray.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games but do not like getting only one life per turn.  other than that it is fine . interesting
B0054LRR3S|4.0|I used to have a difficult time getting my head around what SBTRKT or other artists like him do to put together a track. I can imagine a band sitting around a studio playing their instruments, but I couldn't generate the same picture of SBTRKT's creative process. At least that was the case until I heard SBTRKT's remix of Radiohead's Lotus Flower on [[ASIN:B005SBJG60 Tkol Rmx 1234567]]. Here was a song that I love being remade into something similar but distinctly unique. SBTRKT reworked and manipulated Radiohead's recording to create something that reflected the original song but also stands as a distinct creative work.   Listening to Radiohead's version of Lotus Flower and then listening to SBTRKT's remix shattered my conception of a song. We know the words, we know the music, we know our favorite songs like we know our best friends. We are accustomed to thinking about a song as a something that exists as a fixed entity, but songs are malleable constructions that are subject to manipulation, evolution, and change.   With the idea of music's transitory nature in mind, Sbtrkt becomes more than a series of songs to judge. It's more like listening to a snapshot, a sonic moment captured in time. The album is what these songs were at the moment they were recorded. This recorded version is one of a nearly infinite series of solutions to the puzzle of how to combine a collection of sounds into a harmonious whole. Sound, music, our perception of how things sound, is in constant flux. This album is island of order and regularity amid the ambient cacophony of life.  Rather than jamming with his bandmates to come up with the next hit, SBTRKT mixes, cuts, manipulates, distorts, and blends sound to create beauty. He paints with sound.

0671799320|5.0|I am leaving a 5 star review, as I was extremely satisfied upon the content in the book and everything I learnt once I finished the book. The book is a descriptive, insightful, exciting and at times provocative view on the history of oil. While to book does well in explaining the scientific aspects of this history of oil (i.e. the evolution of the refining process), it focuses largely on the political and economic ramifications of the discovery of oil, the increase in productivity and consumption of oil and eventually the dependence of oil. It provided great insight in relation to the impact oil had on state (i.e Saudi Arabia) and non-State (i.e British Petroleoum) actors and the evolution of state sovereignty over the ownership of oil, especially in developing and third world economies such as Nigeria, Iraq, Iran and Venezuala. By large I am satisfied with the book, however I found faults with aspects of the book.  While the author remains largely neutral in his evaluation and description of the history of oil, at times he seemed overtly sympathetic to the oil tycoons, to critical of states and heads-of-state who attempted to assert their sovereignty over the oil companies and at times even mocked leaders such as Mohammed Mossadeq. His description of the 1953 overthrow of Iranian Parlimentary Democracy and its replacement with the absolute monarchy of the Shah. He claims that the overthrow of Mossadeq had widespread public support and that Mossadeq's supporters were largely a band of thugs. Most history books will argue to the contrary and I suggest people attain a book in regards to the 1953 overthrow of Mossadeq that is not written by this author. Other than this however, the book is a great read. It is long and factual.

0142419400|4.0|I loved the French aspect of this book. Not only was it full of realistic teenage drama and relationships, it's full of the French culture and language. It really makes you feel like you're there with Anna. Amazingly written and witty, I would refer this book to everyone.

B0054JZC6E|2.0|What could be better than 101 free games?  Well the problem here is that they are mostly pretty crappy games. This is the Game App version of the $1 &quot;CLEARANCE&quot;  cartoon DVDs st Big Lots.  Even more disappointing, you have to earn or purchase points to unlock the other games by playing the first 12 or so available games.  Could be a great challenge, but there are better games for free that are leds effort to get to.  Bad controls also make this game a one-day install...or less.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I came to 'The Hunger Games' by accident, after seeing the trailer for the film and finding it intriguing. The name book itself (\\"Hunger Games\\") is one of the most riveting, compelling, narratives I have ever read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it quickly became apparent in the next two books that, unlike J. K. Rowling, the authoress hadn't the slightest idea what she was going to do next. Catching Fire is very bad, Mockingjay is an absolute disaster.

0062011847|5.0|Terry Pratchett is one of the most consistently 'value for money' author writing at the moment. And with 'Snuff' he has done it again.  Commander Vimes takes his family to the countryside for a holiday, I'm sure that it was his idea and nothing to do with Lady Sybil's little chat with Lord Vetinarii at all.  However as we all know, the countryside can be a very dangerous place and it isn't long before Vimes finds the first dead body.   But is it murder or not? goblins are vermin not people, so it is more like pest control than murder, isn't it?   Between a bolshie blacksmith who wants to kill Vimes for being 'a nob'' and the local gentry who despise him for being 'common' Vimes finds the time to educate the local policeman in his duties, encourage his son's pursuit of an education in the wonderful world of poo, and bring a murderer to justice.   Add in side stories involving the rest of the City Watch and you have a very funny book indeed. And even Nobby Nobbs finds true love !!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|One word... AWESOME!!!! I really liked it, beginning to end. Some of the games I had trouble with, but otherwise great with a capital &quot;G&quot;!!!!!
0143119680|2.0|I picked this book out in a bookshop because the premise seemed to hold some interest for me. I' m not a fan of vampire or witch books, but I thought that the characters sounded interesting .   Reader, I was wrong.   The book meanders through the story with no apparent forward momentum for large periods of time. The main female character , Diana, is a witch but although she is a witch with (we are later informed) more power than any other witch around she seems a bit feeble and seems particularly oblivious to all that happens around her. And as soon as the strong , handsome and manly vampire appears on the scene she abrogates all the decisions and action planning to him. While he spends his time telling everyone how brave she is while wrapping her up in his arms and either sending her to bed or for a hot bath....   As for the romance, it is curiously stilted and passionless, perhaps because Diana seeems so childlike around Matthew, it appears more like a paternal or avuncular relationship, so that when they do eventually make physical contact it just seems wrong on so many levels.   There is a lot of alchemical gobbledegook, which may or may not be factually accurate, but is very boring to read.   Quite honestly I only finished this book because I just hate giving up on a book, but I won't be buying the next book in the trilogy because honestly, I don't care what happens to Diana and Matthew. And that , I think is what is wrong with this book, none of the principal characters are either likeable or detestable, they are jjust blehhhhh.   Only Diana's Aunts Sarah and Emily provided any sort of spark for me, but their appearance is all to brief at the end of this interminable book.

034552554X|4.0|Victoria just aged out of the foster care system and is now on her own with no high school diploma and no real work skills. All she has is a love of flowers and the knowledge of their meanings that she learned from one of her foster parents. She finds that her skill with flowers will actually pay the bills and she starts working at a florist shop. The story goes back and forth between the present and Victoria remembering her past in foster care, particularly her time with Elizabeth the foster parent who taught her the meanings of all the flowers. Through her newfound work Victoria slowly starts to connect with people, something she never allowed during her years in foster care, but soon Victoria becomes overwhelmed and pushes everyone away again. This is a fascinating novel that looks at the foster care system, the language of flowers, and the power of love.

0307269981|5.0|Warning! Do not read the blurb on this book's dust jacket. It spoils what would otherwise be an eye-opening surprise.<br /><br /> As with its predecessor, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE's best quality is its heroine. Though she is not as fresh and original as when I met her in the first volume, her history is amplified in the second volume. She is interesting enough that material I would ordinarily judge inappropriate and boring was acceptable and interesting. For example, Stieg Larsson describes at length the heroine's mundane tasks of buying clothes, buying an apartment, and furnishing the apartment. Also, Larsson describes the heroine's vacation activities in the Caribbean and her meeting of a boyfriend there, neither of which has anything to do with the plot. Indeed much of the first hundred or so pages of the book have nothing to do with the plot. Still it is interesting.<br /><br />I advise that you have recently read the first volume before reading this one. You do not absolutely need to, but information from the first volume supplements the second and provides you with a richer overall picture. Also, the staffs of Milton Security and of Millennium magazine return in the second volume, and it is pleasant to be familiar with them.<br /><br />Regarding the plot, it had an unexpected flavor. The plot revolves around illegal trafficking and enslavement of young prostitutes. So I expected it to proceed like Liam Neeson's movie TAKEN. He played a father whose daughter was kidnapped and turned into a sex slave. The Neeson hero locates the traffickers' nest, barges in, shoots the place up, and rescues his daughter. But despite the theme of sex trafficking, Stieg Larsson's plot is quite different from the movie's. None of the scenes occur in a trafficking nest, or any kind of whorehouse, and there is no rescue like the Neeson character's. Though Larsson's novel has sex and action, the story is not one of heroic rescue. It is investigative journalism. More scholarly, if you will.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|5 Star App!<br /><br />This is my best app find. I tested out the free version (Sleepy Time Lite) and then traded up to the paid version almost immediately, and I'm glad I did.  If I recall correctly, the free version not only has limited sounds - although still a healthy amount - but no layering of sounds.<br /><br />I've struggled with insomnia for a while now, and some nights getting to sleep feels like a matter of sheer will. I have a little machine somewhere that does a lot of what this app does, but I have no idea where it is, it's gathering dust.  I couldn't set it for very long and it ran on batteries. And, I paid a lot more than $1.49, the current prince for this app.<br /><br />\\"Sleepy Time\\" on my Fire can simply, obviously, be plugged in, and you can set the timing for anything from five minutes to twenty-four hours. I'm going to say that if it takes you a day to fall asleep and this persists, that you need more than an app.<br /><br />What I really love is that there are eighty sounds and you can layer up to three, controlling the volume on each one.  Some of the sounds are variations on sounds, like three different ceiling fans, but there is enough differences in sound that it doesn't feel like padding the numbers.<br /><br />When you find your favorite mix, you can save it.  I usually like some sort of mix of cat purring, air conditioner, and white noise, or perhaps wind chimes. I love water while awake, but it's not relaxing to me since I start dreaming about plumbing problems ... and since my insomnia is based on anxiety and a brain that won't slow down:  No running water! If you're a fan of it though, there is \\"fish tank\\" and \\"fountain\\" and not just \\"rain\\" but rain hitting various surfaces.  (And \\"rainy drive.\\") \\"River,\\" \\"Row Boat,\\" \\"Shower,\\" \\"Sprinkler,\\" and Thunder Storms 1, 2, and 3. \\"Underwater,\\" well, you get it.<br /><br />The only criticism is that some of the sound mixes, like \\"Farm House,\\" tend to be predictable and the loop too obvious.  Time for the cow to moo again. I think the monotonous sounds work better - it's harder to tell where a cat purring ends and begins again. With so many sounds, though, I can't imagine anyone couldn't find several relaxing sounds.<br /><br />One good night's sleep, when you're truly at the end of your rope, is worth a hundred times more than the cost of the app!<br /><br />Update: 7/3/13 This is still a winner! I still use it.ime for the cow to moo again. I think the monotonous sounds work better - it's harder to tell where a cat purring ends and begins again.

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|.....for those who know 'the hits' nothing but the hits'.....and who dont like it any other way but, here it is, for the most part, from start to finish, as it was in that Hot July Summer Moment......  Though ,Live Aid's main organizer and head honcho Robert Frederick Zenon Geldof aka Bob Geldof claimed (according to his book) that he wouldnt have had 80 percent of those acts on the bill at all!  If Bob Marley were still alive (at the time), Geldof would have begged him (Marley) on his knees  to perform.  Aswad, another possible pick, was hardly known outside of the university walls. Most would turned on to something else on the telly and would have poured very little monies into the Live Aid fortious pot!  So with that in mind, and keeping with the 'current trends' of the mid 80's timeline, this is what one is treated to (amorously).  For what it's worth....a five-starrer.....for me, no more than a 2.  For those music lovers of Farrokh Bulsara/Helen Folasade Adu.... and not to forget those ardent fanatics of Johnny Michael/Anthony/Terrance/and William of Sab ....and hey Rogey and Petey....ah the Tim Ripper Owens crowd.....oops I mean Bobby H/KK DEE's leather lovers....others have gone and done t-h-e-i-r appropriated props and accolades......  With that outta da way.....Let's get to the good stuff....not much....mostly on the first disc and mainly the artists who started off the days proceedings......  Status Quo..... the 12 bar 'boogie brothers' Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt (whose last names also sounded like a nice dessert wine)cranked out a nice but short 2 song set (there is a 3rd toon that got cut to techincal difficulties), Johnny FOGerty's classic 'Rockin All Over The World' and a Quo classic in its own right, 'Caroline.' For those 'few' who like their blues served up in 'the usual' , dont know what u is expecting....but this is it....and its mighty good...  Style Council......John 'Paul' Weller and Mick Talbot.....the 80's aggregation that took over whereThe Jam DIDNOT..... Much Much more funkier than aformentioned group's earliest records etched to wax.....but nevertheless......a nice little romp thru a psuedo-Stax/Motown world of r&b musical delight to the bouncing beat of 'Internationalists' and 'The Walls Come Tumblin Down'.....  # 3 'De Man of the Day' -Bob G and his famously 're-nowned' Boomtown Rats, who promised to never love Eva Braun, deliciously serve up two 'Hot Ratz' fav-ravs.....'I Dont Like Mondays' and the almost hit that never was....'Draggin Me Down'  (the latter was Little Fifi Geldof's toon she loved the most by her daddy!) Now only if America knew what this was all about.........  Fast forwarding a tad-bit to Midge Ure/Ultravox's two-fer tasty goodies, 'Dancing With Tears In My Eyes' and 'Vienna' are done to perfection with the group's frontman  evoking the passion plus of the studio-recorded treasures. Midge, who NEVER had an interest in Eva Braun , is, btw, the co-written of the all-star studded 'Band-Aid' , world-wide hit, 'Do They Know Its Christmas' whose monies were ardously donated to the Africa relief program(s).    REALLY skipping ahead to his girl Friday's best 'disposable matinee idol' (more so than Robert Bobby Mitt Romney) is the 'fornlorn' leader of the 70's leading 'art-rock' act, 'Roxy Music', the flushed-out of the flesh man hisself, Bryan Ferry..... who delivers a bouncy, bossa-nova-ish  Ferry forte, of his own 'Slave to Love' and the J.W.O. Lennon's poignant ballad, 'Jealous Guy.  Ah nice nice very nice....   Up next on the 'hit list' is the Scottish Band, 'Simple Minds', whose perennial leader/vocalist Jim Kerr and partner in crime, guitarist/co-writer Charles Burchill,  who give their best to the group's two most overplayed toons of the time, 'Ghost Dancing' and 'Dont You Forget About Me' But hey...a good band IS A good band regardless, which for the most, set the pace, for their 'continued' haul in the biz right to this day!  Finally, the formerly known David Jones (not tob confused with the one time teen heart-throb of 60's manufactured tv group The Monkees) kicks things immediatley into full throttle with a 70's go round of 'TVC15' , 'Rebel' 'Modern Love' and the Brian Eno collaborated experminetal drone, 'Heroes\\" (Just For One Day).  Bowie's Band is quite tight, not to mention!    And oh yeah...the bonus footage of the phenomenal/emotional Nick-O-Val/Teddy 'Bear' Pendergrass performance of 'Reach Out...' is without q , the icing on the cake for this all day  extravogonzo of wonderous delight......  Cheers and injoy (who u havent already........)

0307593312|2.0|This book was originally published in Japan as an epic novel in two volumes.  A third followed later.  The English language edition, released in the U.S. in October 2011, came out as a five-pound, 932-page monster.  Printed with glorious closeups of a woman's face on the front cover and a man's on the back cover, plus page-numbering with numbers backwards and forwards and other ultra-cool graphics throughout, the tome looks like a defense of the beauty of printed books.  And beautiful it is.<br /><br />At its core, the book grapples with the theme of opposing realities balancing each other as a foundational concept of our existence.  The heroine of the story, Aomame, is wholly sympathetic even though a cold-blooded assassin.  Her male counterpart, Tengo, stood out as a math prodigy in his school days but turned out a fiction writer.  Aomame is taking a taxi to get to her appointment more quickly, but the traffic on Tokyo Metropolitan Expressway number 3 has stopped dead.  Opposites everywhere you look, permeating every level of the book.<br /><br />I loved the immersion in the Japanese topography, culture and mentality.  The author deconstructs Aomame's name, which means green pea; only, as the author puts it, the name uses the same characters as green and pea.  We are reminded that there is a different system of writing than our alphabet.  And everything is different here.  Evil Japanese killers talk politely; coffee comes in cans out of vending machines; rice and fish are served for breakfast and toast for dinner.  In the entire book you will not find a single four-letter word.  You never forget you are in Japan.<br /><br />The author brings his theme of opposing realities to a dramatic froth by having first Aomame, then Tengo, enter a parallel world which Aomame knows as 1Q84 (as opposed to 1984, when the story is ostensibly set), which can be recognized at a glance by looking up in the sky.  The parallel world namely has two moons, and whoever can see them is inhabiting it.  In this parallel reality certain things become possible which have never been seen in the gray, gritty real world of Japan anno 1984:  things like immaculate conception, \\"Little People\\" who inhabit dead bodies and come out when no one's looking to wreak a little havoc in the real world, and levitation, to name a few.<br /><br />How does our definition of time change in a world in which the good force is perfectly balanced and opposed by bad forces?  The male lead, Tengo, reads to his father every day even though his father is in a coma and there is no evidence he can hear.  His father produces tiny amounts of urine in a catheter, and he smells, and his whiskers are shaved and his nose hairs clipped every three days -- his life continues in this reduced form.  Is a person on life support already partly dead?  Are people on the other side of the great divide still partly alive?  Borrowing heavily on Proust, Kafka, Orwell and many other influences, Murakami explores themes that have perplexed human beings since the beginning of the thinking mind.<br /><br />But as a work of fiction, despite all these positive aspects, the book is marred by major flaws.  Not only main characters are described in great detail, but also minor characters who appear just once or twice.  The author thinks nothing of using hundreds of words to describe Tengo's elementary school teacher.  Generally I want to see characters this vividly, sure, but only if such detailed description serves a narrative purpose.  But this character has no real importance in the story.  In the first third of 1Q84, I trusted Murakami to have a purpose up his sleeve, and the descriptions mesmerized me.  Murakami is a master of description, and puts his skill on display.  As I reached the middle of the novel, I began to doubt there was anything more to it than putting those skills on display.  The final third of the book was a torture.<br /><br />Not only is there too much description in 1Q84, there is also too much repetition.  Over and over again the same thought processes, the same conclusions, the same views of the sky.  Even if the book appeared serially in Japan, and it was the custom to remind readers what happened in the last book, or clue in new readers who had picked up the story for the first time, Murakami goes much too far.  It is as if the author does not trust his readers to keep the details straight.  I found myself telling the book, \\"You said that already five times.\\"<br /><br />Paradoxically, the paranormal events that form the centerpiece of the book become far less credible precisely because in his zeal to fill in every blank and leave no detail unmentioned Murakami fails to create an atmosphere of mystery.  If he had let my imagination fill in the blanks, my imagination would have done the work it wants to do when reading fiction.<br /><br />I saw some reviewers trying to excuse Murakami's repetition and overdescription by calling 1Q84 a \\"picaresque\\" novel or by saying repeating things over and over makes them real for this author.  I don't buy it.  The book is trying to join the ranks of the heavy hitters named above by touching on big themes and shrouding everything in the mists of mystery.  But in the end it comes off as pseudo-philosophy, and the characters I felt so attached to in the first third of the book feel like puppets being manipulated this way and that by the author.<br /><br />Legions of Murakami fans are going to tar and feather me for my opinion.  They have their view, I have mine.  1Q84 is an elegant, beautiful and mesmerizing story that is weighed down, and ultimately sunk by a mile-thick icepack of overdescription, banal repetition, and name-dropping artifice.  I wish the book had been edited more strictly to become the masterpiece it should have been.ght processes, the same conclusions, the same views of the sky.  Even if the book appeared serially in Japan, and it was the custom to remind readers what happened in the last book, or clue in new readers who had picked up the story for the first time, Murakami goes much too far.  It is as if the author does not trust his readers to keep the details straight.  I found myself telling the book, \\"You said that already five times.\\"    Paradoxically, the paranormal events that form the centerpiece of the book become far less credible precisely because in his zeal to fill in every blank and leave no detail unmentioned Murakami fails to create an atmosphere of mystery.  If he had let my imagination fill in the blanks, my imagination would have done the work it wants to do when reading fiction.  I saw some reviewers trying to excuse Murakami's repetition and overdescription by calling 1Q84 a \\"picaresque\\" novel or by saying repeating things over and over makes them real for this author.  I don't buy it.  The book is trying to join the ranks of the heavy hitters named above by touching on big themes and shrouding everything in the mists of mystery.  But in the end it comes off as pseudo-philosophy, and the characters I felt so attached to in the first third of the book feel like puppets being manipulated this way and that by the author.  Legions of Murakami fans are going to tar and feather me for my opinion.  They have their view, I have mine.  1Q84 is an elegant, beautiful and mesmerizing story that is weighed down, and ultimately sunk by a mile-thick icepack of overdescription, banal repetition, and name-dropping artifice.  I wish the book had been edited more strictly to become the masterpiece it should have been.

0670021652|1.0|I am not going to finish reading this book. I tried. For more than a year! I started reading this book immediately after EPL about a year ago under the illusion that it would be a STORY of her coming to terms with marriage, NOT a research paper with personal insight. I bought it on the Kindle so I only got as far as 62% of the book when I had to stop. I came here to see what other people had to say, to see if there was hope and if it got better at the end... Sad to say that is not the case. Every other page or so had some sort of reference to either other people's idea, other people's research, and quotes from all over literature regarding marriage. It just feels very \\"researchy\\" and I can dig the whole questioning behind the book, but it seems to me that she ripped most people off. She rode the wave of EPL's success and decided to make a sequel that somehow connected to EPL, undoubtedly to make some sweet cash. I regret buying the book because it really, really blows and it makes me look at EPL in a different light because she went through a beautiful spiritual journey very few have dared to take, only to come out somewhat selfish and arrogant. I am very disappointed. Money back please! If only.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|it has some cool games. then some real dumb hard games. over all ok. could make it more fair. if you don't like a game you don't play it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is clearly amazing. it has the ability to have multiple notes going at once. You can also group them in to many folders
B004LWZW4C|5.0|Great movie... So much so that i've already seen it on the big screen. Worth watching more than once, even if you're not a x-men fanatic. Very clever storyline. Happily i haven't encountered any problems playing the thing through my PS3 console. My heart goes out to those who weren't able to accomplish that
B0054JZC6E|1.0|Boring games that scale in difficulty from easy to insane very quickly. The game selection early on is terrible. I suggest passing on this lame attempt at a variety game
0553381695|3.0|First let me preface this by saying I am one of the GoT readers who was prompted to read one of these books when I heard about the HBO series, shortly before it aired.<br /><br />I like to read very good science fiction (Iain Banks) and very good historical novels (Patrick O'Brian).  When I read Book One of GoT, for the first 99% of the book I considered it an historical novel based loosely on 15th century England, Europe, and Western Asia.  That was all good until the last chapter or so when dragons became reality instead of ancient myths.  Suddenly the book shifted to sci fi, and I shifted my frame of reference from an earthly alternative history to one of science fiction taking place on some other planet where there are animal life forms not available on earth.  (Think Dune).  And that is how I approached Book 2.<br /><br />Book 2 bounces along lively.  The reader (and characters) get fooled and surprised a few times, and these plot turns are convincingly well done.  It has an interesting ending, none too strong, but adequate for encouraging the reader to buy Book 3.  Like Book 1, this book has about a dozen recurring major characters and easily three dozen minor recurring characters; after awhile I grew weary of trying to remember them all.  Eventually I stopped trying to keep track of them all, and just kept reading.  The big battle scene is a little over the top but still compelling.<br /><br />By the way, I have found that Kindle versions of books often have more spelling errors and typos than print versions, but I have not seen any in these first two GRRM novels.<br /><br />Worthwhile read, especially if you are air traveling with the inevitable delays.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was immediately engrossed in the novel and would not put it down for hours at a time.  It takes a lot to keep me up at night but this book did.  I did think that some of the middle of the book could have been reduced.  Lots of fluff about living in one area.  Characters develop that aren't central to the story, but who knows, they could be in another book.  You do run into some of SK's characters from other novels.  Little literary Easter eggs.  I did want more to come from the end of the story line.  I thought that could have easily been more developed.  All in all, really enjoyed it.  Well done Mr. King. JL
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is just great! The graphics, sound, and story are just fascinating. (Note:This version IS the full version). The adds don't make a difference and the story about the pigs stealing the bird's eggs is really good. I rate this 5 stars because it truly deserves it. You should definitley buy this really enternaning app/game.
B000002KDW|5.0|At this point, because of Rod Stewart's paralleled solo career that was gaining momentum, thus giving the Faces' even more momentum as a successful live act, Nod finally broke the band into the mainstream and provided the classic, rollicking Stay with Me as proof that Stewart and the band were becoming a hot commodity within 70's rock at the time. The downside of this scenario was that while Stewart had double time with the band and his solo career, the rest of the Faces were seen more and more as time went on, as merely a sideman's group. Ronnie Lane would leave the band within 2 years time after this album, justifying his feelings of dissatisfaction with Stewart's unknowingly, yet unwanted overshadowing of the band as a whole. Despite all of this, A Nod is as Good as a Wink...collectively holds up and stands as the Faces' most successful release and the interaction of the group as a whole is on full display here muscianship-wise and within the songwriting aspects as well.  Miss Judy's Farm kicks things off with a bang as Stewart and Co. offer up a sleazy, gritty rocker featuring heavy Wurlitzer playing from Ian McClagan most prominently along with some nasty guitar lines from Ron Wood. Another rare collaboration between Wood/Stewart and Lane is the heartfelt, soulful and reflective Love Lives Here, which provides a dynamite vocal from Rod and the arrangement further shows growth and strength from within the band as a whole. Glyn Johns co-produced this set with the band and I feel, captures the Faces' ultimate studio performance; especially on tracks like Stay with Me, Too Bad, the cover of Chuck Berry's Memphis, Tennessee and the record's closer That's All You Need. Lane's contributions include the hilarious You're So Rude, the drunken shambolic-feel of Last Orders Please, and the magnificent track Debris. Lane and Stewart share harmonies on the bridges of this number as it gives another soulful angle within the simplistic, yet deepened beauty of this tune. As mentioned earlier, the band tackles Chuck Berry's Memphis, Tennessee within an arrangement that shuffles and is a bit subdued, but only just! It still is an interesting take(Faces-style), nonetheless. The album closes with the strong Wood/Stewart penned Too Bad, which is a dyed-in-the-wool typical Faces rocker, and That's All You Need, which recalls a bit of Around The Plynth from First Step with the winding slide guitar of Wood, but closes out the record in a typical hard groovin'- but we could fall apart at any minute-Faces style, which, became their signature as an intriguing live band.  If you like good old rock and roll music, and as I do, prefer to hear Rod Stewart within a BAND situation(as opposed to a solo artist with a backing band) A Nod's as Good as a Wink....is probably the best album to hear from a casual fan's point of view. This one and Ooh La La have me torn between the two as to which is the better of the lot; but I tend to think meshing the best songs from both releases would probably be my choice, utltimately. Nod's gets 5 stars regardless

B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is a must see movie. I would be cautious with what age of child to watch this movie.  My 4 year old walked out in some of the \\"scary\\" parts but she enjoyed the overall movie.  My 9 year old loved the movie & asked for it for Christmas.  It was very uplifting & encouraging to see that even with struggles in life, someone can make a go of even the bad stuff that comes their way.  Excellent message, they did a great job with the shark attack, not making it too gory but getting the point across.  Bethany Hamilton was & is such a brave girl & inspirational.  HIGHLY recommend this movie.

B004DK5CYM|4.0|While there are some similarities and obvious comparisons between this film and \\"Seabiscuit\\" from 2003, this movie is more about the owner than it is about the horse.  Seabiscuit was a smallish horse, always an underdog.  Secretariat was a big horse, with excellent breeding and was certainly expected to win.  Both caught the eye of a nation at the time.  This movie however focuses on Penny Chenery Tweedy (Diane Lane) who goes from housewife to horse farm owner much to the dismay of her husband and brother.  When her father dies, she refuses to sell the farm and promotes the big red horse who ends up winning the Triple Crown in 1973.  I remember it well and it was exciting.  The Disney made PG movie is well done, well acted and well told even with the Hollywood touch all over it.

145162445X|5.0|Lawrence Krauss in typical fashion, weaves a story of great readability, into the depths of recent cosmological thinking. Anyone with even the slightest scientific knowledge will appreciate this new addition to his work. I was in line this morning first thing and spent the day reading and re reading this book. His writing is concise, his breadth of knowledge seemingly infinite. No other hard science writer today, does what Krauss does with such an intricate topic. Taking up the mantle of public hero for the sciences, Krauss picks up where Sagan left off. Don't wait for tomorrow to get this book. Go out tonight and pick up this tomb of unparalleled wisdom!

B0000B1OFL|5.0|I think some would agree. Most remakes are very bad but this one holds its own. In my opinion, for whatever it's worth, I think it is better than the original. Lot of action in this and tons of good players in this one. Never a dull moment. Wahlberg shines in this one as do the others. And what can we say about Donald Sutherland? He was his usual greatness but his character was short lived sorry to say. Just buy it. You'll like it.

B000VZR75K|5.0|Bob Ezrin played Phil Spector on this one...a departure from what preceded it, Destroyer pissed off some of the KISS Army, yet steadily brought in a wider fanbase. From the tragic narration of a drunk driver in Detroit Rock City,the songs just open up with denser melodic textures. The slow-paced yet heavy God Of Thunder...deep cuts like Flaming Youth and Sweet Pain and of course...Beth, the first KISS ballad. Ironically the Peter Criss crooned tune was what saved this album from burying KISS after succeeding with Alive, unlike Peter Frampton when he sought to follow up on his famous live album. There are early signs of bad things to come though, such as not every member of the original band played throughout the entire record, or Ezrin buddy/session guitarist Dick Wagner doing the solo on Sweet Pain, but the finished product isn't the worse for it. Not my absolute favorite, but an utmost essential KISS album if you want to earn the right to call yourself a KISS fan.
B004DK49DW|2.0|When I don't find a CD or its MP3 files playing in my home unit or the truck stereo, it just isn't that good of an album. I do not like this album much at all. The last album they put out was pretty good and I played it some, but not as much as White Light, White Heat, White Trash which was the first S.D. I listened to.

To give us hope no matter what our circumstances. That she did not let the celebrity go to her head is amazing. The CD is perfect, clear and it is as if Ms. Boyle was here in the room with me. Thank you so much! What a wonderful Christmas gift, Jimmy!

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|Works great just as a cover to protect my Kindle Fire. However, I was hoping that the feature to make it stand up would work better. The groove in the back is shallow and it doesn't hold the weight of the Kindle very well. It slips out with the slightest movement. The elastic strap keeps it securely closed when you want to carry it around in your bag. And the rigid shell is thin and sturdy so it is truly lightweight.

B004UUKDNA|5.0|I got this CD as a special offer so it was on sale, and I was kind of skeptical as to whether the other songs would be nearly as good as \\"Pumped Up Kicks.\\" Usually I buy CDs to find out only one or two songs are good, but I was pleasantly surprised to find out this was not the case with Torches. All of the songs are great (although I think \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" is still my favorite) and it's worth every penny. The music is pretty mellow and great for playing in your car or just listening in your room. The lyrics aren't ones you're used to hearing 100 times. It's great, I definitely would recommend it to everyone.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I was happy with the product, and the way my transaction was handled.  I gave a Kindle Fire as a gift, and this cover to protect it.  My daughter was happy with her gift.
B004529NKC|5.0|Step Up Three, written by Amy Andelson, Emily Meyer, and directed by Jon Chu was an amazing movie. The movie is 107 minutes, not too long. This movie definitely fits its rating of pg13 because young children wouldn't find it interesting.   Step Up Three is about a group of New York dancers, who team up with an NYU freshman to compete in a dance competition against some of the world's best dancers. They soon find out that dancing will change their lives. I really like the story line and the dancing was really cool. The soundtrack in this movie is fantastic(\\"Club Can't Handle Me\\" - Flo Rida featuring David Guetta ,\\"My Own Step (theme from Step Up 3D)\\" - Roscoe Dash and T-Pain, featuring Fabo, \\"Already Taken\\" - Trey Songz ,\\"This Girl\\" - Laza Morgan , \\"This Instant\\" - Sophia Fresh featuring T-Pain ,\\"No Te Quiero (Remix)\\" - Sophia Del Carmen featuring Pitbull,\\"Irresistible\\" - Wisin y Yandel ,\\"Spirit of the Radio\\" - Jrandall). All the songs had great beats and moved the plot along well.  The actors, Sharni Vinson, Rick Malambri, Adam G. Sevani, Alyson Stoner, and Keith Stallworth do a really great job in showing their passion for dancing. When it comes to the visual effects you can't compare them to the visual effects in the first and second Step Up. The lighting on the stages is by far better. The message appears at the end of the movie. What I learned from this movie is never give up on something you love to do for something you don't like to do.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This has everything one needs to keep abreast of the weather.  Especially if you live in an area of the country that gets severe weather (like I do in the Midwest with tornadoes) .

B006IGZWB2|5.0|The Help, directed by Tate Taylor, was a fantastic movie. The acting was marvelous, the plot was more than interesting, and the message was one that needed to be heard by all, no matter the color of their skin. The movie, which took place in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1962, was about the black maids that worked for the (sometimes) rich white women. The employers, such as Hilly (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Elizabeth (Ahna O'Reilly), are not always so nice to their maids, Minny (Octavia Spencer) and Aibileen (Viola Davis). Along comes Skeeter (Emma Stone), aspiring novelist and journalist, who is currently stuck with a job writing a housekeeping column for the Jackson Journal. Skeeter's idea, to write an anonymous book about what it is like being a black maid in Jackson, first does not go over well with the maids; it's just too dangerous. Slowly, they join this project, but meanwhile, they all have to deal with issues, like money, family issues, and crazy or mean employers. This movie was based on the book by the same name by Kathryn Stockett. As I read the book before seeing the movie, I wondered what parts they would keep and what they would take out. Obviously, not everything could stay- it was a 525 page novel squeezed into a two and a half hour movie. I was very impressed by the way that they used direct quotes from the book in the movie. The message, one of how anybody can be equals, no matter their race, was a very important one that people should take through their whole lives with them. People think that nowadays, now that we have laws against segregation, racism has suddenly just evaporated from the world. There was one line in the movie that stood out to me, that was supposed to be funny, when Hilly is talking to Skeeter, and she says, \\"You know, there are real racists in this town.\\" If that's what she honestly thought, when she herself was quite against black people only because of their skin color, that should make us think about ourselves a little bit deeper.   Although this movie is only two and a half hours, for those few hours, you feel transported back fifty years and as if you were dropped into the middle of these women's lives. I think that the length was perfect- short enough that it didn't seem meandering, but long enough that you felt angry at the parts when Minny was angry, excited when Skeeter was excited, and content when Aibileen was. It was as if they were your best friends for that period of time you spent in the theater. The ending was not completely satisfying, as you are still wondering what will become of them, but it really made you think, which I'm sure is what the director was going for.   For this movie, I think that those who make up ratings for movies did a good job by rating it PG-13. There is a small amount of domestic violence and the police are very rough with someone, but overall there is not much violence. There is also a scene where one of the characters gets drunk while driving, which is a bad influence for young kids. Parents' biggest concern, though, would probably be the amount of cursing. Many of the characters curse as part of their speech, but there is one word that really moves the plot along, so it is used quite often. Personally, I think that kids are used to cursing, as they hear a lot of it starting around the age of ten, but parents might not want to intentionally expose their kids to these words yet. The ideal minimum age for this movie, in my mind, is probably either eleven or twelve. There really is no maximum age, as I believe that it is a movie that anyone can enjoy. The novel itself was an adult novel, yet when the movie came out, it was loved by both teens and adults.   The acting portrayal in this movie is terrific. The actors show a great amount of feeling, and they say their lines with heartfelt emotion. Out of all the very talented actors and actresses in this movie, I would say that the best was Viola Davis, as Aibileen. You can really see that she feels she isAibileen. One of the best scenes in terms of acting, though, is one without Aibileen at all. This is the scene where Yule May asks Hilly for a loan. Yule May is trying to put her twin sons through college, and she is short just seventy five dollars. She asks Hilly, her cruel employer, for a loan. Not only does Hilly say no, she has the nerve to tell Yule May that \\"it's for her own good\\". The way Hilly speaks to Yule May, in such a phony, condescending way, makes you despise her, wonder how anyone could possibly act the way she does and not feel disgusted with herself. Aibileen put it perfectly: \\"You a godless woman, Hilly Holbrook.\\"

B002VPE1AW|5.0|To tell the truth when I walked into the theater to watch the movie \\"Avatar\\" I did not think it would be any good.  I was wrong.  To start off, the special effects were one of the best I have ever seen in my entire life.  Every scene was portrayed with color and vibrancy.  It even made the Hallelujah Mountains (floating mountains) seem legitimate.  Although the actors may not be exactly who you would have expected, they did a phenomenal job.  When you are watching the movie you truly believe that the actors are the character they play.  Each line was spoken with true feeling and emphasis.  One of the most remarkable things about the movie was the language.  The fact that the movie producers can create an entirely made up language and then have each actor memorize it is beyond me.   On the surface it may seem that the storyline is pretty fantasized and has nothing to do with your life, but if you dig a little deeper you will realize that it is very relevant.  The movie brings up the idea of corporate greed.  The government wants to go to Pandora and harvest its riches.  When they get there they realize that an entire population is settled on the land, but they do not care.  All they want is the riches and therefore are willing to do anything to get it.  I think that, along with some fighting scenes, is the reason it is truthfully rated pg13.  Despite the great aspects, the fact that they name the ore that they cannot obtain \\"unobtainium\\" is pretty cheesy.  If you are going to create an entire dialogue for the Navi you can at least come up with a clever name for some ore.   My favorite scene was towards the end when Neytiri fought Colonel Miles Quaritch.  This scene was very dramatic because Jake Sully was trapped unconscious and Neytiri had to get to him first otherwise he would die.  The blows went back and forth, Neytiri riding a vicious beast, and Colonel Miles Quaritch fighting inside a robot.  When Neytiri knocked Colonel Miles Quaritch's gun out of his handshe pulled out his knife and killed the beast.  It landed on top of Neytiri trapping her under his corpse.  This scene supports the theme of the movie which is trust.  Neytiri had to decide whether or not to accept Jake as one of the Navi and had to trust him.  The same went for Jake.  He needed to decide whether or not he should trust the marines or the Navi.  Overall, \\"Avatar\\" surpassed its expectations and `wowed' almost anyone who came to see it.

B00003CXA2|5.0|A GREAT MOVIE   \\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994) is about an ignorant man who, trough out his life, either does or experiences monumental things and major historical events. The main character of the movie, Forrest Gump, is played by Tom Hanks. He is excellent at portraying himself as an ignorant southern man. Also, Tom Hanks does an amazing job imitating a southern accent.    The visual effects of the movie are very impressive. Whether the directors are portraying Forrest Gump as an American soldier in the Vietnam War or as a football star on the Alabama Crimson Tide. The movie makes it seem as if Forrest Gump was actually there when those events took place. Also, throughout the whole entire movie the visual effects make it seem as if the filming crew was filming the events as they took place.   The rating for this movie, PG-13, fits the movie very well. There is barely any inappropriate language or other inappropriate things. Also, the movie has such an exciting plot. Forrest Gump goes through so many remarkable things in his life that it is so hard to get distracted from watching the movie. Whether he is a ping pong champion in china, a shrimp boat captain, a soldier in the Vietnam War or when he, for a short time, is part of the Black Panthers. The plot and the movie, as a whole, are so interesting and a great movie to watch that it is so hard to get distracted from watching it.   Also, this movie conveys a message. I believe that the message is no matter how ignorant or stupid you are; you can always do or experience substantial things in life.    Overall, I think that Forrest Gump was a great movie. Whether it was the amazing visual effects or the extremely attention-grabbing plot. It is a great movie and I encourage everyone to see it.
B004X80QNG|3.0|Most of my calendaring happens on Exchange. I even put personal stuff on there because I don't want my coworkers putting meetings when I'm out of the office. So I rarely use Google calendaring.  I used this realizing that it did not sync with Exchange. I liked it, especially how easy it was to search for specific items. But in time I disliked managing two calendars, so its inability to sync with Exchange makes this a game stopper for me. Same thing with the to-do list.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Although The Dark Night had incredibly high expectations for following up Batman Begins, there is no doubt as to whether or not the movie lived up to the excitement. The Joker played by Heath Ledger is the new villain replacing Ra's al Ghul, the villain in Batman Begins. The Joker's unpredictable character leaves you wondering as to what he will do, while the Batman's response to the situations in the movie are no surprise. Even the more insignificant roles, such as Lieutenant Gordon and Rachel Daws, contribute to the plot while not being in many scenes. Rachel's frustration from Gotham asking for the Batman to give himself up and her not being able to tell who it is puts Harvey Dent in a spot where he thinks it would be best to say that he was the Batman. Since Harvey gets arrested all of the hundreds of criminals he caught would be freed. Gordon's needing to rely on harvey forces Batman to run away  at the end of the movie.    The movie shows that people really only care about themselves. This is shown during a scene at the end of the movie. All of the people of Gotham were escaping on two boats. On one boat were all of the criminals and everyone else were on the other boat. The Joker put explosives on each boat and gave each boat the detonator to the other boat. If neither boat exploded the other the Joker would blow up both of the boats. Both boats were about to destroy the other until they are saved by the Batman.    The Dark Night is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is action pact with amazing visual affects. I would recommend for anybody who hasn't seen the movie to watch it immediately, despite the two and a half hour duration I would say that anybody nine or older can see the movie. There is nothing inappropriate, but some parts might be a little scary or disturbing to younger kids.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|This is an entertaining drawing app, allowing me to do what I mostly use mspaint to do on my PC. But with this, I can do it on the go. It is easy to use, intuitive, and very colorful. Admittedly, I don't use it too often, but it comes in real handy when trying to entertain children in a fun, creative way. THEY LOVE IT!! And I enjoyed it the little time I've been in there myself, though I'm not much of an artist.
0792151712|5.0|Director James Cameron has outdone himself.  We all know the famous story of the sunken ship, Titanic.  Thanks to Cameron, we got a chance to really experience it.  It is heartwarming and definitely tear jerking in most parts.  I felt sucked in to the scenes and was riding the Titanic with the two lovers throughout the movie, Rose and Jack.  Rose DeWitt Bukater arrives on the Titanic, dreading the upcoming marriage of her and an obnoxious but very rich man.  Her mother is now penniless, and is forcing the marriage.  Rose couldn't be any more depressed as the ship of dreams begins to float through the ocean.   One night on the ship Rose goes to the dock, to the very tip of the ship.  She almost jumps to take her life, but is stopped by a young man, Jack.  This is the first encounter between the two opposites, a first-class woman and a poor young man who only got a ticket on the ship through a game of poker.  Though opposites, they make the perfect pair and you can already feel the love flowing between them.  They meet each other more and more, much despised by Rose's mother and fiancé.  You're so caught up in the romance between Rose and Jack that you forget all about the tragic end that will come to them and the ship there on.  A scene that resulted in many tears for most was when the ship had already sunk and hundreds of people we're floating in the freezing water.  Jack had gotten a piece of wood for Rose to lay on instead of staying in the icy ocean.  They hold their hands, shivering to death.  Rose gives up as she sees no way to survive it.  Jack forces her to hold on to life and promises that she will survive, grow up, and raise a beautiful family.  Though Jack's beautiful promise came true, the same fate couldn't be said for him.  He died like many others in the deathly cold ocean.  The actors we're excellent in this scene.  You felt all of their pain and despair and your heart ached for them both.  The special effects weren't as great as they could have been, but did include a fascinating model of the Titanic.  It was specially made to be able to break in half after it hit the iceberg.  The movie was long but you barely noticed as you we're so caught up in the romantic story.  The rating of the movie is PG-13 which is appropriate because of the dead bodies scattered everywhere in the water and all of the terror when the ship is sinking.  The whole story is being told by the older version of Rose many years later.  She is being interviewed about her experience on the Titanic.  The last scene of the movie is a bit surprising and beautiful. It was a great ending to a great movie.  Actors Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio, who played Rose and Jack, were excellent.  A job well done to James Cameron.  Titanic was one of his bests.
B001HN6922|3.0|Cars is back except this time the story isn't as layered and the special effects have gone up a few notches. In fact, if you're a car guy/gal then there's a lot to appreciate with all the inside jokes and background setups. At its heart this is a tale about friendship and forgiveness but some of the scenes might be too much for younger kids, I suspect. Mater had some of the best lines. As an adult it was a hit or miss picture for me. I think they tried too hard to get the adults on board for this picture and lost a lot of the younger kids. That said, it still did really well financially. The budget was $200M and the Worldwide Box Office was over $559M. HUMOR: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; CHARACTER/DIALOGUE B minus: SPECIAL EFFECTS: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: November 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
630529142X|5.0|The Waterboy is a very funny comedic movie. The movie is rated PG-13 because of some nudity but other than that it is perfect for children to watch. The main idea of the movie is that the kind Bobby Buchea is put in a predicament when his mother does not want him to play football. Although the movie was hilarious the visual effects were only mediocre, this having to do with the time period in which it was made. The movie was a perfect  length and is a great movie to watch on a rainy day.  Adam Sandler does a fantastic job as Bobby Buchea from when he is making jokes on the field while other people are \\"making fun of him\\" to when he falls in love with an ex-con. Henry Wrinkler who plays the head coach of the Mud Dogs does a good job when he hallucinates and when he talks to Bobby before each game. Jerry Reed who plays the ex partner of \\"The Fonz\\"(Henry Wrinkler) is great when he insults Bobby and when he calls him a \\"mommas boy\\" and that he is good for nothing.  In the movie Bobby learns to overcome his social problems and wins the Burben Bowl for the Mud Dogs. This is a lesson to be taught, that if you give something your all you can achieve anything. The actors do a fine job portraying this and overall they are a great cast who played each part well. I think that this movie is a classic and will be watched by many people in years to come and this movie is also one of my all time favorite.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked it a lot. a very very fun game. lots and lots of fun. I would have given it 5 stars but to many adds.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|The Fantastic, Fantastic Mr. Fox  It is without comparison that Regency Enterprises and Indian Paintbrush present to a us a the thrilling adventure of Fantastic Mr Fox.This picture that can only be described with one word, fantastic! The book portrays a simple message of excitement and fun that the movie does a phenomenal job adding onto. George Clooney and Merly Streep give the light to a problem that children never think of, \\"Where is my life going?\\"   There vivid voices make kids laugh with jokes that their parents who are accompanying them actually get. A common theme showed in the movie is expectations, how Mr. Fox had amazing expectations for what he would do with his life but has not accomplished a single one. This is all part of the plot about foxes who formerly stole from three mean farmers who are now their neighbors, the temptation is so high to steel again that they can't resist and find themselves in trouble along with many of their animal brethren.   Fantastic Mr. Fox's stop motion design has yet to find a worthy   competitor with its complicated and intricately designed characters and scenery. My favorite scene would probably be the waterfall scene when Mr and Mrs Fox explain to each other their problems, while surrounded by elegant falling water that encompasses the hole screen.  The only bad thing about this movie would have to be that is too short, the audience leaves dying to continue this marvelous tale.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|AN EPIC FILM   The movie \\"Unstoppable \\"is an extraordinary movie, portraying the true story of an unmanned train posing an enormous threat to a nearby community.  The movie is directed by Tony Scott, written by Mark Bomback, and stars actors Denzel Washington and Chris pine.  Denzel Washington, who plays Frank in the movie truly plays his part as a responsible veteran train conductor.  The acting he portrays accurately presents his emotions at each moment in time.  For instance, when he is basically engaging on a suicide mission, he both shows his fear, but also his audacious character.  Chris Pine who plays Will, is able to show his growth in maturity and responsibility throughout the 2 hour movie.  At first he shows that all he cares about is his recent divorce, but as the situation occurs he gets his priorities straight and acts as a responsible co-conductor.  A unique acting skill Chris has is that he is able to precisely show his excruciating physical pain, incorporating peculiar movements and verbal signs of his pain.  Unstoppable, was a phenomenal movie, consisting both of epic scenes and drama.  Throughout the whole movie, the watcher is left in suspense, predicting what is going to happen at each moment, but always surprised with the outcome, for the movies is just that unpredictable.  The movie is capable of keeping an audience on their toes throughout the entire movie, whether it is between a near death situations, or of what step to take next in bringing the train to a halt, in order to prevent the unmanned train from contaminating a city with its toxic content. The visual affects presented in the movie are extraordinary and I highly recommend seeing the movie in I-Max, for it will immensely enhance the movie.  The movie consists of several epic explosion scenes.  For instance, there is a point in time when a diesel engine attempts to slow down and eventually stop the train by getting in front of the train and putting initiating its brakes.  Unfortunately, this plan proves to be unsuccessful, for the unmanned train devours the diesel engine, causing it to explode and kill the conductor.    The very end of the movie is predictable, but not in a disappointing way, for the events leading up to the end are not.  When you finally see the end result, you almost feel relieved, because everything ended up turning out fine, following all the other unsuccessful attempts.  There was a particular scene in the movie which consisted of drama, propelled action and suspense.  In this scene Will is jumping from box car to box car, anticipating to reach the front of the train. As this is happening the train is at a speed of over 60 mph and at each box car, he has to manually initiate the brakes.  There are also helicopters and other vehicles traveling nearby.  The age recommendation truly fits the movie, for there are several scenes incorporated into the movie, which have the potential to scare children 12 and under.  Unstoppable was a phenomenal movie consisting of drama, propelled action and suspense.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Shawshank Redemption is a remarkable movie with an amazing director: Frank Darabont, and with astounding actors: Tim Robins, playing the role of Andy Dufresne, and Morgan Freeman, playing the role of Ellis Boyd Redding, also known as Red. With the amazing plot and props help you experience what being in prison would feel like. With excellent timing of 2 hrs. and 22 min., the story seems to express a total of 20 years in great detail. Both themes of redemption and friendship show greatly throughout the movie. Shawshank Redemption is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.        Andy Dufresne, a very clever and mild mannered New England Banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her secret lover and is sent to jail. Despised at first by other inmates, he is quite and keeps his business to himself. Andy slowly creates a friendship with Red, known for his ability to smuggle things in to the jail, and his gang. Later, Andy also forms a friendship with the guards by assisting them with financial help and is rewarded with protection from the rougher convicts. To add even more exitement  to the plot, the Prison Warden takes advantage of his banking knowledge for financial counseling and will go as far as to kill someone to maintain him in the jail, even if there is evidence that he is innocent. Andy is able to preserve his sanity and dignity by using his mental force. His smarts and confidence keep him going and he is able to teach the other prisoners that hope is the ultimate mean of survival.        Shawshank Redemption taught me, and I hope everyone who has seen it a great lesson. It taught me that violence will get you nowhere. Instead when you use your brain, and strive to do the best that you can, you will almost always win. Feeling that Shawshank Redemption's rating of R for language and prison violence is not a fair rating and therefore I recommend it to all people 13 and older. I recommend this movie not only to people who like dramas, but to people who love comedies, action, inspiring movies, and all others because no matter what type of movies you like, you'll love Shawshank Redemption.

0743298039|4.0|This novel opens with Margaret Lea, an apparently middle-aged woman living in England.  She is a lover of books who has known nothing but her father's small bookshop all her life; she now lives about the shop and continues to make a living off her father's occasional exchange of rare books.  Although Lea is an amateur biographer, her subjects of choice are deceased, just as her reading material is from the previous century.  So she is completely surprised when she receives a letter from England's most popular current writer, Vida Winter, saying that Miss Winter would like Miss Lea to author her memoirs.  After further reflection--including reading Winter's mysterious unfinished book, THE THIRTEENTH TALE--Lea decides to pay Vida Winter a visit.<br /><br />I received this book as a gift from my mom; it's not something that I would have necessarily picked out for myself.  And, I admit, I had a bit of trouble getting into it at first, particularly because the time seemed so indeterminable (although I now that I have read the book, I would estimate the \\"present\\" to be around the 1960s).  Once Vida Winter begins telling her story, however, I was drawn in.  Winter tells the tale of being raised at Angelfield, in a decrepit mansion household with two twin girls running wild.  Author Diane Setterfield clearly intends to pay homage to JANE EYRE and perhaps even other classic novels such as WUTHERING HEIGHTS and REBECCA.  The writing is engaging, and I was definitely caught up in the plot.<br /><br />On the other hand, there were a few things which prevented this from being a 5-star read for me.  First, the sub-plot about Lea's own story felt forced.  I didn't buy the idea that Winter could have know that Lea \\"knew about siblings\\" from her writings alone, and I didn't like how Lea's story was resolved.  The other issue I had is that the actual title of this book doesn't really fit with the plot.  The reference to a \\"thirteenth tale\\" is ALSO a sub-plot, and, as it turns out (very minor spoiler), a disappointing and almost completely irrelevant one, which seems a bit unfair to readers.  Overall, however, I did enjoy this book, and I would recommend it to others who enjoy this type of genre.ry minor spoiler), a disappointing and almost completely irrelevant one, which seems a bit unfair to readers.

B004A8ZWW4|4.0|In the year 2020 - just eight years from now - human boxing is replaced by giant robot boxing. Excited spectators are no longer watching human boxers. They are watching huge robots clashing, controlled by humans. There are even underground robot fight clubs. And the top of the new sports is WRB, World Robot Boxing league. On paper the story of \\"Real Steel\\" sounds ridiculous. On screen, it works.  Directed by Shawn Levy (\\"The Pink Panther\\" \\"Night at the Museum\\"), \\"Real Steel\\" follows the story of a down-on-luck boxer Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) and his estranged 10-year-old son Max (Dakota Goyo). Their strained relationship is apparent from the onset, but things slowly start to change when Max discovers an obsolete \\"sparring bot\\" buried in the junkyard. Charlie doesn't think so, but Max believes the old robot can fight (he calls it \\"Atom\\"), and persuades the reluctant father to give Atom a chance.  Despite the film's incredible setting and some stereotyped supporting characters including a robot genius Tak Mashido (Karl Yune) and his wealthy sponsor Farra Lemcova (Olga Fonda), \\"Real Steel\\" delivers. The \\"Rocky\\"-like story is familiar, but remains compelling, thanks to the thrilling boxing fight sequences helped by first-rate visual effects (especially of Atom), and strong acting from the stars Jackman and Dayo.   More like a father-and-son drama than a sci-fi action, \\"Real Steel\\" is a real winner.
B003P2WO5E|4.0|I almost put this one down after the first couple of chapters.  Glad I didn't, this is one of the most unique books I have read recently.  Brandon leads you through the lives of several characters that all will eventually cross paths creating changes in the world as it is known in this realm.  Truely captivating once you get oriented.
B00338QENI|5.0|What makes this book standout is that Skloot ties together a story about race, medicine, medical ethics, science, healthcare and human beings in a narrative that simply flows.  In 1951, Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer.  She was a decedent of slaves, an honest and hard working woman, and a mother of very young children.  Unbeknownst to her, Lacks's doctors extracted tissue from her for research.  Her tissue produced the first cells to survive and spawn new cell lines -- the HeLa line of cells.  The HeLa cells have continued to replicate and have been used extensively, for example, in developing the polio vaccine and throughout cancer research.  Neither Lacks nor her family were asked for their consent.  They were never compensated or even recognized for the contribution they made.  While her cells advanced medical research and enriched some companies, the Lacks family could not afford basic healthcare.<br /><br />Skloot does a magnificent job of uncovering and telling the story of Henrietta, her family, the doctors and researchers involved and the breakthroughs that they made.  She tells Henrietta's story, the story of the researchers and what they accomplished and, in accessible terms, the story of the advances made by science.  She manages to get close to the Lacks family (in a loving, non-exploitive way) and share their story.  She challenges the reader with ethics questions, some of which still remain open today.  The writing is thoroughly accessible. Highly recommended.

B000O8OTNC|3.0|I purchased this sharpener because of the features and the price. I had high hopes for it, but after using it I was disappointed. I purchased a brand new knife along with this sharpener. The knife was decently sharp when I got it but I thought I could get it sharper using this knife sharpener that everyone has been giving great ratings. After running my knife threw the ceramic sharpener a few times, my knife was actually duller than it originally was. Maybe there is a chance I was using it wrong, but it pretty strait forward how it works lol. I don't mean to make this thing sound completely bad. The fold out serrated edge sharpener works fantastic. I actually ended up using that to sharpen my knife edge. The lanyard hole is also a nice feature. And for the price, its not a terrible deal. So with its pros and cons, I gave it an average 3 stars.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|Shaved maybe 2 feet, which was all I really needed.  It took a while to configure; though it snaps right in it has to be lined up juuuuust right with the Kinect unit.  The preview image on the dash has some blurriness around the edges, so it isn't perfect, but it's been pretty accurate for what I've used it for so far (Dance Central and Kinect Adventures).  Still, I no longer have to move my coffee table whenever I want to play, so I guess it's provided some benefit, though maybe not $20 worth.
B004G6009U|5.0|I typically dislike most Disney these days (I think that gutting a Victor Hugo tragedy and completely nullifying the point warrants outrage and I've pretty much disliked Disney from that point onward) but I watched this film with my husband and our young daughter because it had Zachary Levi and Ron Perlman as voice actors (how often does that happen?).  Suffice it to say that this movie has won me over, was enjoyable to my husband (and brother and parents and in-laws - they all watched it) and is a film my daughter insists on watching every day (she tries to sing although her vocabulary isn't quite up to the task yet).  It is visually beautiful and it's an interesting spin on the folktale (which, obviously, was Disney-fied but at least they had the sense to change the title of the film for this variant).  Even watching it a tenth or twentieth time we stumble on little forshadowings, hints and easter eggs that we didn't notice in the background on prior viewings so there is definite replay value and the combo pack is worth the investment if anyone in the household enjoys the film.
B004GYY714|4.0|very good to listen to local radio.  They do have lots of breaks in music and sometimes shows me the last song played not what's on.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I've been watching Saturday Night Live since I was a kid, so needless to say, I was one of the first people to buy this book.<br />Its hilarious! Tina talks about growing up, the scar (yes, she talks about the scar), getting her first gigs and getting into SNL, and its all told in a very funny, witty and intelligent way - I love this book, and the audiobook is already on its way!
160094048X|5.0|I made three of the recipes the first day I got this book and brought them to work the next morning. They were a HUGE hit with my co-workers (who had no idea they were vegan until later)! The witty writing keeps it entertaining and the authors provide great information on substitutions--including how to make any recipe gluten free. I highly recommend the rocky road cookies on page 46!
1466401885|3.0|Firstly, I will admit that I was consumed by this book (in a self-deprecating kind of way), and I couldn't seem to put it down (much to my chagrin). Because of this I gave it more stars then I would have otherwise.   If you can remember what it's like to be young, passionate (albeit stupid) and in love this book is tolerable if you like A LOT of teenage angst... If you can keep reminding yourself what it's like to be young, impulsive and in a dysfunctional relationship with a narcissistic co-dependent with rage issues.... then this book can be very enjoyable I'm sure. But, if you find yourself having a difficult time relating to such scenarios, I would save yourself the frustration and irritation.   My second issue with this book was the length. The Editor could have shaved off about a third and it wouldn't have hindered the story in the slightest. It was also full of typos, which always amazes me... The back and forth and back and forth of a tumultuous, unhealthy and immature relationship starting to get old after the first 200 pages... But wait... for your reading pleasure... there's another 162 pages of the same dribble...   At 33, I think I might be too old to find this book appealing. Considering the reviews, I guess I have a different view of what constitutes \\"romance\\".
B006LYMILI|3.0|The screenplay seems like it was manufactured by copying all characters out of a cliche book--greedy corporate executive, cruel/crooked animal handlers, misguided scientist trying to help a dying parent. Sadly that may be the reason the apes are more believable than the human characters. Just because the budget was \\"only\\" $93M doesn't mean we can't expect a good movie.  E.g., Hobo with a Shotgun was made for $3M, and had more believable people/plot in it. I think they spent $50M too much. In sum, if you can get pass the annoying humans characters, it could be a good background/airplane movie.

B003VANOFY|2.0|I bought this item from Amazon about 4 months ago when the price was around 120.00. I considered other headsets of this type by Logitech, looking at the G35 and the F540, both of which are less expensive than this one. I went with the 930 because it seemed the most attractive choice out of the three, boasting a metal frame, fully wireless capabilities, 7.1 surround sound, 3 mappable G buttons, and USB rechargeability.  I own two other Logitech devices, both of which I am extremely satisfied with. The MX Revolution mouse, and the older G15 keyboard (The one with 18 mappable buttons).  The features on this headset performed as expected. Range is good, allowing me to sit anywhere in my apartment and listen to music in full 7.1 surround sound. The microphone responds crisp and clear without any feedback in my online gaming venues. The onboard Equalizer allows for subtle changes in music and gaming performance on the fly. The battery life is substantial, not as much as I would like but they give you a REALLY long USB recharge cord to go with it which is really nice. The ear scoops are truly circumaural. I know most headsets claim to be circumaural, but they only go over part of the ear, mushing the rest up against your head. This one doesn't do that. It adheres comfortably to your skull on all sides which is a needed feature for me since I find earmashing is extremely annoying.  So why am I docking three whole stars from this product? The answer is quite simple. There's a manufacturer's defect in the construction which makes these extremely flimsy.  In my 4 months of ownership I have been extremely gentle with these.  Let me say that again. I've been extremely gentle with these...  ...however, due to normal every day wear and tear the two faceplates on the insides near the four mounting screws have cracked. (One has broken completely off). And when this happens the inner workings of the swivel joint are just plastic, so the ear assembly falls out of the frame. A temporary fix of this-- (Continuously pushing the faceplate back into the joint) has somewhat fixed it, but the honest truth is, this thing should not have been assembled this way. It should be a metal faceplate screwed into a metal frame. I don't know if they were trying to make it lighter (I don't see why a half an ounce of stainless steel would have made any difference) but this would have made the headset correct and functional, and a heck of a lot more durable. It really is a shame, too, because I wanted to love these things. As a result, because of dealing with the brokenness, I like them about as much as the 7 dollar headphones I bought at the supermarket which have a lot of feedback in the microphone. They're broken too, but not structurally, and I only spent 7 dollars on them.  Sorry Logitech, but you let this one get by you.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|When I first looked at this book I had no idea what it was really about. I saw all the great reviews, but I've been disappointed by that before. Also, I don't usually like a book that's only about a boy, a girl, and school. Of course it turned out to be much more than that. This book practically gave me whiplash from all the sudden turns it took. Abby's and Travis's relationship probably got me to scream, cry, and go awww (not necessarily in that order) more than any other relationship in ANY other book I've ever read. It was that intense. I loved Abby and I loved Travis as characters. I even loved their friends without becoming too focused on what was going on with them, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />My only teeny tiny complaint-and I can't believe I'm actually saying this is a bad thing-is that I thought it was too long. I usually love long books-especially inexpensive ones-, but I was beginning to think Abby and Travis had gone through enough. It had a great ending, but I think it took too long to get there.

B005ZKYXZI|4.0|My first impression of Real Steel wasn't that good. It looked kinda fun, but kinda not that great. After watching it however, I have to say I enjoyed it tremendously. It actually has a story. It isn't just a bunch of cool action scenes mixed in with a threadbare plot and cardboard characters. This is a boxing movie with robots though and when the action comes, it works great and yes its big and loud, but not unnecessary.       Real Steel is almost nothing like the Matheson short story. The characters, the plot, the time period are all changed, but thats not a bad thing. They're just separate stories. To be honest I liked the movie better, but I recomend the short story as well.    Real Steel is a popcorn movie through and through and its got a lot of heart to go with it.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Krauss has done a great service to folks like me who love the idea of physics and cosmology, but struggle to understand it.  It's evident from the early pages of the book on that Krauss puts great thought into finding ways to present concepts in the most graspable way he can.  Other people reputed to have done this--Lisa Randall, Brian Greene, Stephen Hawking--have left me still confused and only a tiny bit more enlightened, but Krauss's explanations stick.  I even think I could take part in a discussion about \\"nothing\\" now (sounds like a \\"Seinfield\\" bit, doesn't it?).  I suppose one reason Krauss might have better success at doing that than the other folks I mentioned is that he's not trying to take on an entire field, but to demonstrate how the entire field's research output gestures in a few directions that all imply that the universe needs no creator to explain it.  In some senses, that is an easier case to make.  I wouldn't have to teach you all there is to know about genetics to convince you that a particular DNA match makes it likely that the dude on trial is the killer, for example.<br /><br />One more thing I'd like to do here: There was a one-star review by a person calling himself The Proofessor.  It went up just shortly after the book became available and was clearly written without the benefit of his, you know...actually having read the book.  He tried to dismiss \\"Nothing\\" by claiming that it was a \\"desperate attempt by New Atheists\\" to deceive people into disbelieving in God.  I had written a response to this faux review that I rather liked, so I'm copying it below...I think it stands on its own as a rebuttal to knee-jerk fundamentalists who wish to sweep aside that which they are not willing to comprehend:<br /><br />As opposed to the easy-going, casual and time-honored way in which religious apologists have deceived people, you mean?<br /><br />Your god didn't REALLY create \\"ex nihilo,\\" did he?  At the least he created out of his will, his power, his glory, his love and intelligence--or something?  \\"Ex nihilo, nihilo fit,\\" right?  Out of nothing, nothing comes.  Surely this is true for gods as well...or can that conclusion be special pled away?<br /><br />You don't get to wag your finger at atheists and pretend to take some kind of moral high ground when theistic apologists have been lying their pious butts off for centuries.  But to avoid a mere tu quoque argument on my part, let me point out that Krauss is not lying and not being deceptive.  He defines \\"nothing\\" rigorously and never pretends he means by that term something you would have him mean by it.  He lays out science's findings openly, clearly, and without gloss or varnish.  In the rigidly defined sense in which Krauss is using the term \\"nothing,\\" his statements have the force of hypothesis well on the way to becoming theory.  He actually accomplishes most of this in the book's introduction, and makes the point that the theologians putative definition of \\"nothing\\" as \\"that which only God can create from\\" effectively defines aspects of science out of existence (and into the nothingness, maybe?).<br /><br />When I say there's nothing in my fridge, I'm not lying just because it has air in it.  And when Krauss says that the universe arose from \\"nothing,\\" he is clearly presenting a reality that arose from nothing like what we currently observe.  If we were to look at what existed \\"before\\" our universe did, any reasonable person would call it \\"nothing.\\"  That doesn't imply a sort of \\"pure nothing\\" that has no attributes.  That is not a logical requirement to make of the term.<br /><br />This \\"review\\" is just one more mewling rant, motivated by bitterness, because the ancient gods die daily, cut by cut.  Krauss has managed to deliver a mortal gash to one of apologetics' most sacred cows.  Your whining was inevitable, but no less ineffective and unattractive for that fact.gence--or something?  \\"Ex nihilo, nihilo fit,\\" right?  Out of nothing, nothing comes.

B0028IDXDS|5.0|I haven't seen these in person yet, but my son and daughter-in-law both like them.  She even confirmed that the actual pacifer is the same kind given to their twins in the hospital.  They appear to make the pacifer both easier to stay put and easier to find.
B002KSPKRS|2.0|The \\"hiss\\" people complain about is real.  I was willing to live with this, but several other problems arose.  The audio constantly crackled-and-popped, as if from a loose optical coonecton, but I tried several optical cables and connected to my PS3 as well as my XBOX360.  My only other theory is RF interference or just a defective set.<br /><br />Also, I noticed that my wifi networks became much less reliable with these turned on.<br /><br />I traded these in for the wired X12 model and am much happier for it.  I will say that the X41s seemed to have a slightly better sound (forgetting, of course, the hiss and pops)... but the X12s are darned close, and with variable bass boost, and no hiss or pops.... and $100 cheaper.
B000002V07|5.0|Once you can get past Fade Into You...you'll get to enjoy a complete album masterpiece from Hope Sandoval and David Roback . When I purchased the album, I believe I kept on repeating that first track about 12 or so times. I honestly was afraid to continue to the 2nd track, but once I did there were other songs(mary of silence, five string serenade, shes my baby, into dust) that were also worth repeating as well. So Tonight That I Might See probably has its main single(fade into you) that is worth constant play. Normally, im not a fan of hit singles since I tend to skip them since the main point obviously is to sell their album with its catchy tune, yet this song doesn't have that feel at all. A must have in anyones music collection.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We bought this game for our son who is a high school senior.  It was recommended by a family member on the west coast.  Their friends play it a lot.  Now I see why.  Settlers of Catan is an enjoyable game that requires some planning, strategy, and luck.  Because the set up of the game board changes every time, it's a different game every time.  Our family of four plays this at least four or five days a seek since Christmas.  Get it and start enjoying it for yourself.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is a lot of fun. keeps you entertained. but there are far too many ads. other than that. its fine

B0060FXDCG|5.0|Transformers Trilogy is an amazing thrill ride from start to finish!You get 3 of the best action packed movies made that will please any true transformer fan.I have been a transformer fan since the beginning in the 1980's and have loved every single minute of all three movies done.All three have very good storylines with well placed action scenes mixed with some comedy&romance for 3 great quality movies.The first movie is an introduction to the transformers like Optimus,Bumblebee,Megatron,and Starscream for example while setting up the base storyline of the battle between the autobots and decepticons.In the Revenge of the Fallen you get the continuing romance between Sam and Mikaela while some new transformers are introduced into the series with a compelling plot by a new decepticon that concerns a natural resource.Revenge Of The Fallen is an awesome all around sequel that is as good as both of the other films with just as many amazing special effects.Dark of The Moon is probably the best in the set with the most intricate storyline and the most action from start to finish.Sam gets a new girlfriend in Carly and finds himself in the middle of the decepticon autobot war again,but is more battle ready from his previous experiences.The moon holds a secret that sets up the movie storyline along with a decepticon plot.If you like transformers you will love this trilogy set.Bottom line Transformers Trilogy is a high quality,10 out of 10,action packed DVD set that will please any true transformer fan all around.I highly recommend Transformer Trilogy for all Transformer fans out there.Transformers Rule!!!
0525478817|4.0|John Green, at his best, spans the range of human emotion, from ecstatic joy to crushing pain, this is the true genius of John Green: to write a weird story that can span that range.  The Fault in Our Stars is about a teenage girl with terminal cancer who falls in love with someone, in a story about death, the fragility of human life, and the ability to capture our memories forever.  Of course, there are weird moments along the way, and a few laughs.  The reason this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star book is because the joy and witty humor John displays at his best is somewhat missing from this novel.  This is not a light hearted novel.  It hits hard and is raw, filled with emotions and the heaviness of the questions it asks.  A must read for teenagers looking for a deep novel.

145162445X|5.0|A Universe from Nothing by Lawrence M. Krauss<br /><br />\\"A Universe from Nothing\\" is the fascinating book about how our universe came from nothing.  Using the latest in scientific knowledge, his expertise and the innate ability to explain very complex topics in accessible manner earns this book five stars.  Lawrence Krauss takes us on an exciting voyage of discovery that helps us understand the universe and further whets our appetite for more knowledge.  This 224-page book is composed of the following eleven chapters: 1. A Cosmic Mystery Story: Beginnings, 2. A Cosmic Mystery Story: Weighing the Universe, 3. Light from the Beginning of Time, 4. Much Ado About Nothing, 5. The Runaway Universe, 6. The Free Lunch at the End of the Universe, 7. Our Miserable Future, 8. A Grand Accident?, 9. Nothing Is Something, 10. Nothing Is Unstable, and 11. Brave New Worlds.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. This book is truly something!  A page turner.<br />2. A thought-provoking, inspirational quest for knowledge...I loved it!<br />3. A profound book that is intelligible. An achievement in its own right.  Very complex topics accessible to the masses.  Thank you.<br />4. Elegant prose with conviction.  Lucid and clarity in a world of dark matter.<br />5. A journey of cosmological discoveries.<br />6. Effective use of charts and illustrations.<br />7. I have a much better understanding of our universe as a result of this book and most importantly it has only whet my appetite for even more knowledge...and that's why I read.<br />8. A love affair with science and for good reason.  The three key principles of scientific ethos.<br />9. Startling conclusions are presented.  The author does a wonderful job of letting us know what we do know versus what we don't know.<br />10. Some of the greatest discoveries presented.<br />11. I finally have a reasonable grasp of the Big Bang, Bazinga! The three main observational pillars.<br />12. Of course you will get to hear about the greats of science but I really appreciate the stories of the lesser known scientists who provided vital knowledge, such as, the story of Henrietta Swan Leavitt and Vera Rubin. Bravo!<br />13. Great facts spruced throughout the book and some jaw-dropping insight.  One scientist was able to defend his mother in a witchcraft trial...find out whom.<br />14. What general relativity tells us.<br />15. The uses for gravitational lensing. Let's get Zwicky with it.<br />16. Dark matter and dark energy...enlighten me.  Or at least try.<br />17. Quantum mechanics, I will never understand it but I can appreciate it what it provides.<br />18. The author does a good job of telling us what scientific progress has been made and how that applies to cosmology.<br />19. A flat universe??  Find out.<br />20. An explanation of nothing that means something to me. Can you say quantum fluctuations?<br />21. A \\"creator\\" in proper perspective. The requirement of some externality.  Read it and you will understand.<br />22. Multiverses...oh my.<br />23. String theory a critical view.<br />24. A little bit of philosophy for good measure.<br />25. The best explanation for how something can come out of nothing to best current knowledge available.<br />26. Key concepts will now become part of your understanding...\\"the existence of energy in empty space\\".<br />27. Black holes under the light and some very interesting takes.<br />28. Spoiler alert...one of the most profound questions, \\"What I want to know is whether God had any choice in the creation of the universe.\\"  Thank you, Mr. Einstein.<br />29. An interesting look at Aristotle and the First Cause in the light of new knowledge.<br />30. The book ends with a bang of reality.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. No links or bibliography.<br />2. A lot of the concepts of this book are hard to grasp.  Some readers may not have the patience and inclination to take the time to properly digest what is being offered.  That being said, the author does wonders in making such difficult concepts accessible.<br /><br />In summary, this is a fantastic book, a real treat. I learned so much and admire the author for providing a book that is accessible and enjoyable to the masses.  This book lived up to my expectations.  Fascinating topics in the hands of a master results in a captivating book.  This is how science books should be written.

B002BWP49C|1.0|Ever since I read the epic disaster that was \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" I have been eagerly anticipating this movie. It was one of the vilest, silliest, grossest books I've ever read in my life, and I assumed that the movie would at least be funny. I mean, there's a scene where Edward chews open Bella's uterus!  Well, \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I\\" managed to disappoint me. While there are some jaw-droppingly stupid moments, most of the movie is simply droningly dull -- there's more padding than actual story here, riddled with painfully awkward acting, monotonous sex scenes, and lots of important topics (like abortion) that the writers aren't NEARLY smart enough to address.  Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are finally getting married... and we get to see every single step of it. Everything. We see hairstyling, shoes, invitations, furniture arrangement, awkward toasts and the newlyweds making out at the altar (classy!). Oh, and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) freaks out when he discovers that Bella plans to actually (gasp!) have sex with Edward on their honeymoon.  So they finally have melodramatic sex... only for Bella to get lightly bruised, which upsets Edward so much that he refuses to have sex with Bella again... for about a day.  But then, Bella unexpectedly gets pregnant (wow, sex leads to pregnancy! WHAT A TWIST!). Excepting Rosalie, the Cullens all want her to abort the baby, but Bella refuses to do so even though it's killing her. This threatens to spark off another battle between the werewolves and vampires, because Bella is the center of the universe.  The worst thing about this dreadful movie is that they broke the ludicrous \\"Breaking Dawn\\" story into two separate movies. This works when you have an epic story (\\"The Hobbit\\") or a plot-heavy one (\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\"). But for a tween-porn romance about how special Bella is for having a functioning uterus, it's the kiss of death.  So to fill out all the space NOT occupiedby plot or characterization, the movie is crammed with padding. Lots of padding. Endless padding. We're forced to watch Bella shaving her legs, lounging around the house, and listening to hideously unfunny wedding toasts (except for Charlie's). Even the SEX feels like it has been padded -- I spent most of the PG-13 sex scenes wondering if Bella would ever change expression during sex (and no, she didn't).  But the movie REALLY jumps the rails when Bella gets knocked up with her demonspawn. Suddenly we're assaulted with hellish birth scenes, sexual fantasies about a newborn baby, and ghastly CGI wolves. And whenever those CGI wolves are onscreen, the mood jumps from \\"stoned\\" to \\"hilariously hammy\\" (\\"I AM THE GRANDSON OF THE CHIEF!\\").  Also, there are massive plot holes that render most of the plot pointless. Example: the Cullens whine at Bella to have an abortion or she'll die.. when she's at least 8 months along (physically). WHY DOESN'T CARLISLE GIVE HER A C-SECTION? And are we REALLY supposed to believe that no vampire has ever knocked up a human woman before the 20th/21st century... EVER?!  As for the acting, Kristen Stewart's Bella is her usual graceless, mumbly, whiny, mouth-breathing self;  she seems grossed out by even pretending to have sex with a man. And she spends most of the movie either LITERALLY begging Edward for sex or cuddling up next to Jacob.  And Edward shows just how abusive and obnoxious he can be, INFORMING Bella that she's going to get an abortion and emotionally blackmailing her when she won't. Your dream man, girls! As for Jacob... well, kiss any likable qualities in this character goodbye. After ranting about the evils of imprinting, he becomes a brainwashed pedophile engaged to a baby. And everyone is okay with this.  I at least expected \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I\\" to be horrible in a MST3K way, but sadly it just ends up a slow, dull grind riddled with gaping plot holes. Expect Part II to be doubly bad.
B003DZX3SA|2.0|I tried, but my measurement with the Disney animation films yardstick began with the superior Sleeping Beauty, of which this does not compare. Noisy, brash, contemptible, and saddled with a hero who is repulsive. Plus there are positively no characters I care for, and belle looks typical until she enters the \\"enchanted castle\\" for a much needed makeover. I never cared for the beast, or his situation, one he was cursed with not because he was a victim, but because he deserved it in the first place. When Belle finally announces her love for the beast, I ask myself why. Why, indeed, if not just to give this film a much needed happy ending on cue from the running time since the beginning of the film, because there is no other explanation for her sudden burst of romance after his long bouts of yelling, eating like a pig, and nasty behavior. The hero does not find favor in my eyes, and love doesn't hand out it's hand to every tom, dick, and harry just because they are cast in the right position. At least, not from myself.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, John Gilbert, Rudolph Valentino and Douglas Fairbanks are smiling. This audacious film is a silent movie in black and white, with intertitles for dialogue! This PG-13 homage to early Hollywood absolutely proves that Talkies did NOT invent drama, pathos, comedy or romance; we experience all of these and more, yet only hear one or two words spoken in the entire film. (I just love movies about movies!)  Did you see the \\"OSS 117\\" pastiches inspired by the \\"James Bond\\" films? If so, you can easily picture the hilarious Jean Dujardin as a 1920s silent screen superstar who goes into a tailspin with the advent of the Talkies. Dujardin is a master of the sendup, the spoof, the satirical take-off on vanity, ego and self-satisfaction, so his parody of Douglas Fairbanks is spot on! As are his versions of Gene Kelly in \\"Singin' in the Rain,\\" and Fred Astaire in anything with Ginger Rogers. Amazon.com will notify me as soon as it becomes available.  These actors make it work:    * Jean Dujardin won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this role. He starts out as such a \\"STAR\\" that you are surprised when you see a more human side.    * Bérénice Bejo is transcendent as a spunky Debbie Reynolds-type character in this little show-biz romp. Of course they meet cute and then, shades of \\"A Star is Born,\\" their lives reverse as her fortunes soar and his plummet.    * A clever Jack Russell Terrier promptly keels over when a finger is suddenly pointed at him.    * John Goodman with cigar at full chomp, runs a studio and caters to temperamental stars.    * James Cromwell is our hero's faithful chauffeur and stalwart friend.    * Penelope Ann Miller does a blonde bimbo reminiscent of Lina Lamont in \\"Singin'...,\\" only we never hear this one's voice... Whew!  Writer/Director Michel Hazanavicius has done only French films in the past, but with printed dialogue on those intertitles, this film could be in any language. (Please remember, both \\"homage\\"and \\"cliché\\" are French!) Our screening audience could see that most of the words the actors mouthed were English...except that terrific dog...I'm pretty sure he was barking in French.
B002BWP49C|1.0|This movie goes beyond bad It's not even worth a rental at redbox. I love Vampire movies but this one is just a lot of tripe. Robert Pattinson has such potential and yet he makes such bad choices in movies. As for Kristen Stewart, she really should give up acting. Her razzie award nomination this year is the only award she deserves to win.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a bit laggy at points but works pretty good on my kindle fire. Awesome time killer for the price!!
B004EPZ034|4.0|There are a lot of harsh words being said here and elsewhere about this movie, so I thought I'd put in my two cents worth. When viewing a movie like this, that is obviously made for young children please keep in mind it is primarily for their entertainment.  Most adults aren't going to find it terribly exciting.    I took my son to see it, and while it would not have been my first choice of movie, he loved it, and his enjoyment made it fun for me as well.  If you have a child who already loves the Chipmunks, this will probaby be right up their alley.  Lots of upbeat, chirpy songs, plenty of action.  Alvin is his usual mischevious self, though in the course of the story he does find that he can be the responsible one when he needs to be.  Silly jokes and humor, certainly.  Some warm fuzzy moments as well (no pun intended).  Have a Chipmunk fan in your house?  It's worth seeing.  My son can't wait to get his own dvd copy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I have fun with this. good game when your bored. ill keep playing since I can never sleep at night anyway.
B00005U122|4.0|I purchased this over a year ago. I watched it and thought it was very good. As for the reviewer who thinks this is the greatest concert of all time, you're wrong. I own Rush's Exit stage left, grace under pressure concert DVD, a show of hands, Rush live in Rio, R30-rush 30th anniversary DVD, Snakes and arrows, tour DVD, working men live DVD, and Time machine tour 2011 DVD. you missed the boat as Alex Life son can play circles around anyone else's two guitar players. Geddy Lee has to be the greatest bassist of all time. Neil Part is the greatest drummer of all time.

Read both books over the weekend, and now am extremely impatient for book #3.  I'm one who loves angst in romance books, so my only complaint, if it can even be called that, is I wish the helicopter \\"accident\\" (sorry, don't want to give spoilers) was more drawn out.  Still gotta give it a five star regardless.
B00000DHRX|5.0|I have been a fan of George Michael for more than 25+ years...From his yearly days in the 80's until now..<br /><br />His voice and style of singing are flawless...Regardless of his personal issues, (and we all have them), George Michael, the Artist/Songwriter is classic...Many of the songs on this CD are timeless; Jesus to a Child, simply beautiful!, Careless Whisper, when you hear him sing this song, you are hearing him at his best without fluff...Father Figure, undeniably one of his greatest songs ever.<br /><br />I wish him the best and hope to hear more from him now and in the future..Very few artist sing like this anymore...and if you are a 60's, or 70's baby, you know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />If you have never listened to any of his music, do yourselves a favor, and buy this CD...Pop it in your player at home, sit back and chill....His music will literally put you in a place of calm and at times make you want to get up and dance.....you will not regret it!

King goes on at least 200 pages longer than he needs to.

1451627289|3.0|I live in Maine and am familiar with the areas described in \\"11/22/63.\\" Even his fictional town of Derry is modeled after Bangor. What I've always enjoyed about reading Mr. King is not knowing how he's going to end his stories. The author has proved over and over again that he has no qualms about throwing curve balls into his stories and messing the reader up. This is why I come back to Mr. King's books and \\"11/22/63\\" delivers. Jake Epping time traveling back to 1958 and reacting to the sights, sounds and smells of a bygone era was highly entertaining. It was a nice touch to also bring back a few of the characters from \\"It.\\" The story kept me glued to its pages until he reaches Texas and then... ehhhh... not so much. The romance that develops between Epping and Sadie Dunning and the years spent blending in with small town America before trying to save President Kennedy was pretty dry reading. I understand Mr. King felt it was necessary so as to build up an emotional conflict within his protagonist, but holy cow, writing romantic prose sure isn't his strong suit. After a couple hundred pages of this yucky stuff, the author's story kicks back into high gear right up to the final page. The book felt more like running the Boston Marathon where you have to endure Heartbreak Hill before crossing the finish line and getting your reward. It was not my favorite work by Mr. King, but two-thirds of \\"11/22/63\\" was a fun, suspenseful read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is pretty awesome if you like playing the game solitaire. its simple and does exactly what you expect
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really like this game and most of the games from G5 because you can get so much out of them with all the hidden object games
B006FYI5E8|4.0|Hans Zimmer's soundtrack rang true with another solid walk down Baker Street.  His score blended seamlessly with the movie and hearing it again - track after track evokes stark and memorable scenes from the film.  One of the best soundtrack purchases I've made on Amazon!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy the challenge of earning points...and earning the &quot;new&quot; games. Most of the games are enjoyable as well. l'm looking forward to seeing what other games are ahead.
0143119680|5.0|I was a bit hesitant about reading this book after looking through some of the reviews saying  it was a cliff hanger and such. Well, I am so glad that I read it anyways. I loved it. I could not put it down. It is well written and I loved how the author wove history into this fantasy tale. It was truly an amazing read and I cannot wait until the sequel comes out. And after looking more into the book once I had finished it, I found out that there will be a movie. So now I am also looking forward to the movie and hope they do it justice. It is a long book though so we shall see. If you love fantasy reads don't pass this book up!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow!  This well crafted, fast paced, imaginative novel was a fun read and did a much better than average job of transporting me to another world as soon as I started reading it.  I was hooked after reading the preview and finished the book in only a few days.    The story world and back-story were phenomenal.  Collins knows just how many details to give the reader and where.  I never felt like the author was giving me a boring narration of details she had thought up (this is something that lesser authors struggle with endlessly).  The capital and its culture reminded me of Roman history with their gaudy/extravagant tastes and their insatiable thirst for blood at the games.  The culture absolutely makes sense as some future evolution of the modern American culture.    The characters were strong and interacted well.  Each major character had strong ambitions and story goals - with many that conflicted well.  The dialogue was well done and never felt artificial.  It should be noted that while there are romantic elements to this novel that it is not a romance.  I feel that many reviewers were put off by the main character's coldness - but this was perfectly consistent with her established character.    The plot of this novel was engaging and kept me on my toes.  Collins knows how to effectively create tension in a scene and build that tension steadily throughout the book.  I felt emotionally involved with the characters and couldn't stop turning pages to see how characters would do.  The end of the book is definitely a little darker than your average Hollywood happy ending, but this fits the theme of the book and sets the stage perfectly for the sequel.    As for violence, this book probably has more violence than any other young adult fiction I have read, but it is not excessive.  There are many reviews which insist this novel glorifies violence against children, though I would have to disagree.  If anything, it highlights the horror of the games and how wrong it is that the games are glorified in the Capital.  In any case, the violence is not over the top or excessive - but it is violence and parents should use discretion depending on the age of their kids.   This book contains no sexual content or questionable language, but the only thing which I would consider a con (and this is a matter of taste) is when Katniss is completely naked in front of a grown man who is evaluating how to dress/make her up.  These scenes (there are more than one) are not suggestive or sexual at all...they just feel weird.  However, they fit the novel and its theme well which is why I still give the book 5 stars.    Most complaints that I have seen in negative reviews have to do with people who do not enjoy this genre of literature.  If you enjoy fast-paced, well thought out, imaginative sci-fi then this is for you.  If you are rather squeamish concerning violence or only read predictable love stories, then look elsewhere.  Outside these exceptions, I highly recommend this novel.  Read it!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|I like how this app formats the tasks by providing different lists for activities and allowing due dates to be set for each task.  Overall, I think it is well formatted and worth downloading if one is looking for an organized to do list

0812550706|5.0|What a geeky book this is...but I couldn't put it down.  I fell in love with the characters and read the entire series (for better or worse) on the strength of this book.<br /><br />This is a great story for those that wished that they were kids again, but in the future, and that your genius was recognized and you could save all of humanity.  Excellent action, heartbreaking humanity, desperation of extinction, and a childhood of worth...what more could you want in a story?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is good. it has plenty of time killing games - some of which are pretty challenging. it is especially good when free.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|First things first... Ryan Gosling had the year if his career (so far) in 2011 in 3 films that in my opinion are all worthy of an Oscar. Drive however is the one of the most original films in a long time, it will rank up with Inception and The Social Network at the end if the decade, I guarantee it. Go in not knowing what to expect and I assure you that you will come out blown away, the trailer even makes it seem like a different movie than it really is. I give this 5 stars for the direction, the retro/noire vibe, the excellent cast(which included a ruthless Albert Brookes) and the star... Ryan Gosling, who is one the best actors of our time
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|would love this game if I could download it on my fire. tried 4 times and it still wont work at all. The free version was cool. wish I could play the full one. so far a waste of 6 bucks. not happy at all.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|One of the unusual things about Serenity (and Firefly) was the depth of characterization right from the start. It wasn't such a matter of 'development' of the characters over time, as much as us, the audience, learning about the character depth that was already there from the start.  In other words, it's a rootin' tootin' cowboy space show, but with a whole behind it.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Waiting patiently for MoneyBall<br /><br />Amazon has really been cutting back on the fast service it once had provided<br />I am a prime member and had purchased moneyball last year.  This is the second time I purchased a month prior and missed receiving the film.<br />Anyone else seeing these trends..<br /><br />MoneyBall is a great film which is why I wanted to add it to my collection.<br />I wanted to have a few people come over and watch.  Oh well
B003JTHESA|4.0|Iron Maiden has met The Phantom, The Killers, The Beast, The Trooper, The Ancient Mariner, The Stranger in a Strange Land, The Clairvoyant, The Tail-gunner, The Man on the Edge, The Clansman, The Wicker Man, The Rainmaker, Benjamin Breeg...and have now arrived at The Final Frontier!!<br />If you're expecting a plethora of galloping rhythms, piercing solos and banshee like wails then you had better stay with the early to mid 80's IM. Some of the material reminded me of Rush's early epic era ('75-'78), Queensryche ('94-'03) and Nine Inch Nails. Most everyone grows up sooner or later and it is expressed in our demeanor, dress, lifestyle and our art (if we are fortunate enough to be talented).<br />I happen to like this album as it explores the themes of odysseys, myth, self reflection, closure, faith and hope. We didn't think of these things in our early 20's like one would in their 50's and why would we? I look at the songs as vignettes of adventure and while the compositions are longer they certainly aren't weak. The melodies/solos/vocals fit the songs and create their ambiance. If I were to pick a track that I didn't like it would be The Alchemist because I'm not into Merlin, D 'n D or Harry Potter shyte. Yes, this album is different...but Iron Maiden is Iron Maiden regardless of which era you favor.
B0068RGVMK|1.0|I won't get into a lot of detail here. I have loved Nightwish ever since I heard Angels Fall First and what has always attracted me to Nightwish is that voice. I know Tarja is gone and Anette is with the band now but honestly she is not as interesting as Tarja is and her voice is so limited and weak that I feel it detracts from the enjoyment of the material. Her limit is seriously glaring during I Want My Tears Back where her lack of power makes the song unenjoyable and then with the great music and killer Nightwish riffs ruined when she \\"sings\\" in a warbling, wavering voice during Scaretale. So sad, with a stronger singer (Read: Tarja) these two tracks in particular could have been the strongest on the album. The majority of this cd is a total departure from Nightwish for me and I would not give it more than one listen. Except Slow Love Slow which was so horrible I checked to see if somehow my CD player skipped to a different CD. The concept of this cd does not hold up for me either, in fact it totally reminded me of the SNL skit when Michael Bolton ruins a hardcore rap song with a song about Captain Jack Sparrow! LOL! Do yourself a favor, listen to the samples and then save your money, we deserve better than this drivel! So sad when such a promising metal band dies. I will miss them, RIP...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this a a great app. games are easy to learn and some are challenging which makes it fun to try and conquer. you earn points while playing games to unlock other games which makes you want to keep coming back. all in all this is a great app to have

0307719774|5.0|I have always liked the idea of doing a sentence-a-day style journal, and the Q & A a Day Journal is the perfect tool to do just that!  So far, I am on day 10 and really enjoying writing in the book.  I actually look forward to picking it up at the end of each day to discover the prompt and write... And I look forward to looking back on past entries for years to come. I do not have any issues with the compact size of the book or the amount of space to write each entry.

0142410705|3.0|This will be a short review, both because the book was released in 2008, so it has lots of reviews already, and because I am not its intended audience. An Abundance of Katherines is a lighthearted read intended toward young adults. I am one of many adult readers who enjoys young adult books. This particular book was entertaining, but lacked the underlying meaning or significance of many other books of the same genre.  That's fine. The main character is clever and entertaining, if not particularly likable, and there are some funny moments. There was no point in the story when my emotions were engaged, and no point where I was captivated by the plot, but it was a nice read.  I did notice that some reviewers commented about the presence of language and sexual innuendo in a young adult book. I respect their opinion, and their right to sanitize the influences that touch their own children's lives. I don't think, though, that most parents will be troubled by the content.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good app I recommend it for everyone child or adult. I had a lot of funny unlocking and playing the games.

0312641893|5.0|Cinder is a compelling re-telling of Cinderella with a sci-fi twist. A re-telling that I absolutely fell in love with.<br /><br />Cinder is a great character that was determined to get her freedom. You see, Cinder is a cyborg, a person worth nothing in New Beijing. Her adoptive mother despised her as did one of her stepsisters. She didn't know why she was what she was, she didn't remember anything before her surgery, but she did know that she wanted to get away from her \\"family\\". I admired her heart and her hard-working attitude. She was spunky and sarcastic, yet honorable.<br /><br />Iko, her sweet android was a great addition. Her personality chip made her humorous and realistic and I'm glad that Cinder at least had a friend in her.<br /><br />Prince Kai was absolutely endearing. He would never give up when it came to getting Cinder to notice him. I absolutely adored him and his charming smile. He was modest when he didn't think he would make a good emperor, but he even proves himself wrong with his wisdom and love for his people.<br /><br />Although this is a re-telling, it wasn't what I expected. When I think Cinderella re-telling, I thought that the first half of the book would be about how she is mistreated, then she would go to the ball, meet the prince and live happily ever after with a few differences in there....WRONG! Honestly, If I hadn't been told that this was a re-telling, I probably never would have even guessed. But don't get me wrong, that made me love it even more! Meyer kept true to the basics of the story. Cinder is the mistreated daughter who is pretty much a slave and there is a prince, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. Marissa Meyer takes the story on a completely new and unique path. There's a plague, cyborgs, and a crazy queen from the moon. There's action, adventure, and heart. And although there was one part of the plot I saw coming from the beginning, it didn't bother me that I knew because I thought the idea was great! This new take makes for an absolutely stunning debut and I can't believe I must wait an entire year for the next book.<br /><br />Cinder is an extremely intriguing story of a cyborg Cinderella with more than one twist. It is a prime example of addiction. After reading this, I have come to the conclusion that it is unfair that I must wait a year for the next novel. It should be law that the authors must write and publish all of the books in the series at one time so that we, the readers, don't have to suffer that awful thing called \\"anticipation\\".tunning debut and I can't believe I must wait an entire year for the next book.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|This video is excellent!  The only thing better would be if you were in the front row at the O2 seeing this in person.  The show speaks for itself, but the cast, crew and production couldn't get better.  I've seen dozens of shows in the West End.  With the exception of being at one live, no show can match this.  Enjoy!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|The cd arrived quicker than I thought it would and was in excellent condition. The person I bought it for was very happy with the product.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this in January of 2012 for my Ipad2 with the IOS 5.0.1 and this works flawlessly with the Sd card reader, not sure why people were saying the new update made it not work. I recently got into photography with the Sony Nex5 camera and had new pics to view and share every day. I was plugging it into my pc, down loading them and then emailing them or uploading them to a site. I thought $30 was high for this item, but the ease of use it provides is worth it. simply plug it in and it open the photo app on the ipad and has a tab that says camera. it pulls up all the photos on the Card in little 1\\"x1\\" pics. one downside is that you cannot enlarge them before you save them to the hard drive on your ipad, but maybe it will be an option in later firmware upgrades. just touch the pics you want to save or delete, and they will have a small check mark on the pic, then after you select all the pics you want, just hit the import button and choose selected pic. you can also select all or delete all if you want to. after you select the import option, the blue check marks start to change to green at they are imported to the iPad, and when its done it asks if you want to keep the pics on the card. one cool thing that i like is that when you plug in the SD card in the future, it will bring up the pics and have a green check mark for the ones you have already imported so you don't have to manually check your pics. if you skipped a few pics the first time and now select them for importing, it will place them in order of when they were taken so your photo album on the ipad has them in a timeline of sorts. it also has a tab on the top that says places and another one that says events, the events tab basically grouped all the pics that had a certain date stamp in its own stack of photos, and if you go to the standard photos tab it has the classic layout of all the pics you have saved to it. this makes it very easy for things like Facebook where you can choose the photo option to post a pic on someones page and then if you choose camera roll it brings up all the separate events folders so you can easily find the pics you want to post instead of scrolling through all your pics. also for emailing straight from the iPad seconds after you import the pics while you are in bed, or on the couch, make it much easier and more likely that you will actually do something with the pictures you take. If i lost it i would buy another one, I don't have use for the USB adapter for right now but maybe in the future i will.
B005CKPQHA|5.0|great story line, you really feel apart of the story. Once you start you can't stop. can't wait for season 5

B0064TVQ5E|1.0|On Kindle Fire, keeps force closing at random points in the game.  unistalled this app since that is annoying and makes the game pointless.  also doesn't save the game when you leave the app, or when it force closes.
0439023521|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I'm not even half way through it, and I've already ordered the other two books from the trilogy. If they're anywhere near as good as this one, they're worth the read!

B0054JZC6E|1.0|This is by far the worst app I've ever downloaded for my phone, but not because of the games. The games (or at least the ones I played) were fine. Nothing that stood out and the controls can be a little wonky, but overall they are some pretty decent little games. What makes this the worst app I've experienced is the ads. A little banner ad at the bottom? I'm okay with that. Ads that completely stop my game play and take up my whole screen after every 3 tries (yes, literally 3 - it was so infuriating that I counted)? Now you've got me so irritated that I'm sitting here cussing at the app - and that's not normal for me. I'd give the app no stars because of the overly intrusive ads, but Amazon makes you rate at least one star.

It is a lot of fun and, in my opinion, well worth the buy.

0061743526|5.0|Scout is a young girl in the racist southern part of the United States.  She, her brother, and their friend get into mischief, trouble, and have fun.  But even as they continue to play games for kids, the town they live in is going crazy over a court case--a case in which Atticus Finch, Scout's dad, is on the side that most people disagree with.  The case is relatively basic: a black man is accused of taking advantage of a white girl.  It is obvious that the black man is innocent.  But the racism that is rampant in the town is against him, simply because of his skin color.  Scout watches the trial unfold through the eyes of a child who doesn't completely understand what is happening.    Another aspect of the story is Scout's relationship with her dad.  She often doesn't like him that much: he is older and won't play baseball or do anything else that other dad's do with their kids.  But slowly, Scout's perspective of her father--and of the world--begin to change.  This is a wonderful read for anyone looking for an interesting story, a story showing the two racism that was obvious in the south 70 years ago, and of a marvelous coming-of-age read.

B0068RHGJM|1.0|This has got to be the worst Nightwish CD ever.  I didn't buy their new CD, I just listen to the samples, and I am not impress.  Again, Anette cannot sing to save her life.  Her voice does not do this band justice.  This CD has potential  , if they had a better singer.  This band can do so much better, I should know, I have seen, and heard it.  Listen to the samples, before you buy this CD, this CD is not worthy of your hard earn money.<br /><br />Until the band wakes up and smells the coffee, Nightwish has died, which is really sad, because they use to be so unique, and now, they are not.
0743243315|3.0|This book was ok.  I appreciated the flow of the writing--it was easy to read.  I didn't find myself caught up on misplaced words like some other books I've read.  However, the main events, or what you would expect to be main events, were poorly executed.  There was maybe a page devoted to each \\"main event\\" with most of the book being devoted to ordinary daily doings.  The author would drop the anticlimactic bomb and then move on without spending any time describing the main character's emotions.  It was difficult to connect to the story.  Also, there were so many things in the book that took place without consequence, so it was almost as if there were no point to inserting the event.  The affair elicited no heightened sense of anxiety surrounding the secrecy.  It was just flat, like the character's personality.

B005MIYI3K|3.0|There are many problems with this album.  First of all, it took the band 4 years to release it, which is unforgiveable.  Even the best metal/rock bands can consistently produce an album every 2-3 years.  Secondly, the album is inconsistent.  There are some tracks that flow together quite nicely but they are broken up by slow (if not downright boring) melodies, sound effects (such as a clock ticking for 30 seconds at the end of one track), and dialogue (nearly half of the 13 minute track, \\"Song of Myself\\" is dialogue, which is incredibly lame).  Nearly half of this album is slow and it has a very mellow opening and an anticlimactic ending, which is very disappointing.  Third, Annette Olzen's voice isn't up to par with Tuomas Holopainen's music.  She can hit the high notes but it sounds like she struggles to do so.  All that being said, some tracks on this album are good (i.e. Storytime, I Want My Tears Back).  The sound is extremely similar to Dark Passion Play and strays further from the albums that had Tarja Turunen on lead vocals.  In other words, if you liked Dark Passion Play, you will definitely like this album - at least to a certain degree.  As for me, I'll stick with Oceanborn, Wishmaster, Century Child, and Once for my Nightwish playlist.

0525478817|4.0|...but that's a John Green novel for you.  I was only 7 percent through the book, according to Kinderella (my Kindle) and had to stop immediately and do my dishes, or I knew I would be sitting there all night.  I was also moved to send John Green an e-mail immediately, telling him how brilliant his writing is and how much I learn from reading his books. (I am a 48-year-old woman, a YA-author-in-progress, who reads everything, but has a special love for good YA fiction.)   I loved Hazel and Augustus pretty much immediately, and the book (which I picked up again after doing my dishes and proceeded to read until I was finished) took my emotions on a journey as wild and unexpected as Augustus and Hazel's.  One thing I love about John Green's books is how they can't be characterized.  His books are always so much more than the sum of their parts.  My husband asked me what the book was \\"about,\\" and all I could respond was, \\"Everything.\\"  That being said, I did not give the book 5 stars, only because I felt - with all due respect - that it lost track a bit in both tone and momentum towards the end, when the plot grew a bit more contrived than I've come to expect from Green.  I only give 5 stars to books that leave me feeling like, \\"This was the best book I've EVER read!\\" even for a little while.  I didn't feel that way, but I did feel like I'd been on the rollercoaster with Hazel and Augustus, and I was left pretty much a red-faced, snot-nosed mess.  I adored some of the secondary characters as well, such as Isaac and Hazel's parents, and even the walk-on character of the waiter at the fancy Dutch restaurant.  Drinking champagne will forever be all the sweeter because of him!  I've read quite a few excellent books about living and dying this past year, but none have made me think and feel as much about both as \\"The Fault in Our Stars.\\"
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is a Christmas gift for my son, he held on to it for a long long time, and every he pick it up and play with it for half hour or more!
140053271X|3.0|With two or three major reservations, I think that this is a superb little machine. I have just received it here in Canada, as a belated Christmas gift, and in terms of readability, all its features match the advertising.  This Nook model is not available for sale outside the US, for good reason, though. The WiFi is locked into Barnes & Noble, only.  There is no \\"period\\", or \\"dot\\", in the numerical keyboard, so it is not possible to enter another url, either to make a purchase from another bookseller, or, more importantly from my point of view, to log on to the local library (this would appear to apply to local US libraries as well; what a waste of WiFi!). You have to download everything onto your PC and transfer via the cable included. Also, you cannot make a purchase with B&N from outside the US, on this machine.  I don't mind the latter, as I rarely purchase books, anway, but I am disappointed that all these details are not made more clear in the advertising.    It took hours and hours for the battery to make its initial charge from my PC.  You can see from the package that there was once a space in it for a wall outlet adapter (the holes for the prongs have been taped over).  Making this a separate accessory is obviously a cost-savings measure for B&N, a poor comparison with other companies which automatically include an adapter with their e-readers.  Finally, the support phone number provided for outside the US won't go through to a live body.  Just as you reach that stage, the call is terminated with a statement that the transfer cannot be completed and you get the dialling tone.  I hope people calling from within the US have better luck.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I really like this case.  For me, I have no issues making it \\"prop\\" up the Kindle, and I feel that it protects it very well.  I personally wish the inside of the cover wasn't that soft fuzzy material, but that is only because I have cats and their fur sticks to that like glue (not that I am setting the Kindle on the cats, but their fur gets around.)  I love the included rubber band that holds it closed.  I love the weight of it, it is lightweight without being flimsy, in my opinion.  Certainly works well for me!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I have given myself a week to reflect on my thoughts and read other reviews before I decided to communicate my analysis and final thoughts on Mockingjay.  I think it is only fair to judge this book as a portion of the overall experience the author provided.  Mockingjay as a standalone book is a difficult read but is an essential component to the trilogy.  I have decided to give Mockingjay (as well as the other two books) five stars because it stays true to Collins original direction and the character's true identity.  I think that the negative comments I have all read resolve around the emotional unrest and anguish this book elicits. And I give credit to this sentiment because I was left feeling lost, confused, and ultimately heartbroken when I finished this book.  Collins touches on a subject that is all too real and so so difficult to comprehend: PTSD.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert.....Spoiler Alert......Spoiler Alert<br /><br />I think this book is difficult in a number of ways to read because Katniss' emotional journey and lack of mental stability are the main storyline throughout Mockingjay.  The Hunger Games and Catching Fire had Peeta's presence to balance out Katniss' emotional deficiencies, where Mockingjay largely does not.  Katniss' anger directed at Haymitch for not saving Peeta is so real and exactly what I would have expected and wanted.  Her heartbreak at losing Peeta was difficult to read at times due to the fact that Collins captured the sensation perfectly.<br /><br />I feel that my initial unrest after reading the book revolved around Peeta and not Katniss.  From the Hunger Games through Mockingjay, Katniss is the same physically strong, intelligent character.  Her continued dependence on emotional guidance in Peeta is evident in all three books (providing her bread to continue fighting for survival, giving her a reason to fight in the 75th Hunger games, and her reason for becoming the Mockingjay).  Katniss relies on key relationships to continue her fight for survival.  Peeta, however, was a responsive, emotionally touching character throughout HG and CF, but we lost this aspect in MJ.  Peeta's hijacking is devastating because his fears from HG become reality.  \\"I don't want them to change me in there.  Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not.\\"  His callous conversations and threatening mannerisms resulted in my grief as a reader.  Ultimately, though, Collins uses this shift in behavior to subtly reaffirm our original hopes, that Katniss really does love Peeta and misses his tenderness.<br /><br />Eventually, Collins leaves us with the best possible ending.  I have read several reviews in which people feel that Katniss is left as an empty shell of herself and she keeps Peeta in her life for convenience.  I have such a difficult time understanding this conclusion.<br /><br />After Prim's death, Katniss' mental state spirals out of control within her depression (a condition of PTSD).  She is a shell throughout those months.  She finally comes back to reality in time to realize that the new government is just as capable of expending innocent young lives.  In my opinion, her vote to continue the hunger games was a decision to affirm that Coin was no better than Snow and to personally justifying killing her.  Katniss' PTSD continues after she kills Coin and she gives up her desire to live (which we have seen before in HG before Peeta gives her the bread).  It isn't until Buttercup returns that Katniss can begin the grieving that she must partake to begin her healing process.  This marked a turning point for me because Katniss then describes her growing back together with Peeta and the return of the warmth he provides her.  I cannot interpret this any other way than beautiful.  Collins was vague with Katniss' emotions throughout the three books but when she touched on the subject it was delightful.<br /><br />\\"I don't want to lose the boy with the bread.\\"<br />\\"You're still trying to protect me. Real or not real,\\" he whispers.<br />\\"Real,\\" I answer. \\"Because that's what you and I do, protect each other.\\"<br /> \\"And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me.\\"<br />\\"I clench his hands to the point of pain. \\"Stay with me.\\"<br />His pupils contract to pinpoints, dialate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. \\"Always,\\" he murmurs.\\"<br /><br />Collin uses the simple exchange between Katniss and Peeta at the end of the chapter to confirm their love.  This is where I think Collins wanted us to think back on the good times and use those moments to imagine Katniss' life with Peeta.  \\"What I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life can go on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.\\"  To have good days and bad days, Katniss could not be a shell.  She had regained her life and was living it to the best of her abilities.  Fighting the PTSD when it returned and focusing on the pleasures in-between.<br /><br />I would love feedback from other reviewers.  My husband is in the middle of The Hunger Games and I'm not allowed to verbalize any of my thoughts until he has completed the series.at you and I do, protect each other.\\"    \\"And then he gives me a smile that just seems so genuinely sweet with just the right touch of shyness that unexpected warmth rushes through me.\\"  \\"I clench his hands to the point of pain. \\"Stay with me.\\"  His pupils contract to pinpoints, dialate again rapidly, and then return to something resembling normalcy. \\"Always,\\" he murmurs.\\"  Collin uses the simple exchange between Katniss and Peeta at the end of the chapter to confirm their love.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|While this book doesn't have the same depth of social critique as similar books (Neuromancer, Snow Crash, Otherland, etc.) it does tell a great story. The cliches throughout the story, including the main premise, feel more like intentional homages to the pop culture elements that provide the backdrop for the entire tale. Regardless of the deeper meaning or literary merit, I found this book to be a great page-turner filled with satisfying \\"Hey! I get that reference!\\" moments. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who was a geek in the 70s, 80s, and 90s.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use it often.  wish NIV could be downloaded but I am sure that is a zondervan restriction I highly recommend it.
0670022950|4.0|It may seem that the world is becoming more violent when we look at the numbers of those who died during the two world wars of the Twentieth Century but the author uses statistics to show that there is less violence today than hitherto. That we think otherwise is because we know more, thanks to global news media and because there are more people alive now:  in terms of pure numbers, more died but in terms of percentages, less.<br /><br />It is reassuring to read, backed up by statistical research, that the more intelligent one is, the more likely that we will have liberal views.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for pacifists: stick at it because the cause is on `the winning side'.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|easy games. moving up is simple. I really like the variety. you get to choose from. I would recommend this app to my friends with androids.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I LOVE this game.  A good brain trainer,  I play it everyday!  I have had no problems at all with this app on my kindle fire.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Most of the mini games are fun but past the 3rd level it takes more than 300,000 points to unlock ONE game! The problem is that you only earn on average 10,000 points per game you play so there is too much of a lag between points earned and what it takes to get new ones.
B0063IH60K|5.0|a very nice version of a timeless game. The advertisements are annoying but hey, its a free game. Definately worth your time
B00005LOUQ|5.0|I bought it on VHS when it first came out.  I kept it and a few months ago my 3 year old daughter discovered it and wanted to watch it.  She watched it probably 20 times and the quality of the VHS started to fade...plus she dropped it and the flap thing fell off.  So I decided to surprise her with a new DVD for Christmas and she was thrilled.  She's watched it a couple times so far and we've had no problems.  Cute movie.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the fast play of the games. Points add up slowly however, persistance absolutely pays off with these games.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a typical game of solitaire. simple yet very addicting. I cannot play just one game. if I sit down to play, I am stuck playing for at least 20 minutes!
B005HI4LLY|4.0|I had the pleasure of seeing this movie in the theater, and by the time it was over, I was in so much pain from laughing so hard! If you are a fan of horror movies, then you have to see this movie. Sure, there is a lot of gore, but it is not in the \\"Friday the 13th\\"/\\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" gore for gore's sake, but rather simply to illustrate the absurdity of the movie itself. The movie pokes fun at the entire genre, and it spares not even itself. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a movie and knew that I had to see the movie again, so I pre-ordered this as soon as I saw it available on Amazon and watched it the night it arrived, and it did not disappoint the second time around (nor the third!).

B005K17RU0|4.0|One of the best weather app for the Fire, but could still use improvement. Mostly just minor tweaks. However, for a freebie app it's definitely worth the download to check it out.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Although implausible, this book was highly entertaining and often made me LOL.  I was sorry when it ended and I had to return to reality and couldn't put it down long enough to make it last.  An offbeat romantic comedy with a real message for women who are made to think they have to \\"have it all\\", especially those in pre-law, for whom it is not too late to take back your life.  I read it on my Kindle:))
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a ton of fun! like 117 apps in one! it has a ton of games! all of them are my favorite!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Thank the Lord for Kindles, and these books, literally I finished the second book and couldn't wait to begin this one.   Unfortunately, overall, I feel that there was a lot more holes in this story line then the other 2.   All of a sudden Katniss's world is turned upside-down. She finds herself in District 13 after she was rescued from the Quarter Quell, whether she is a distraught teenager or flustered citizen this girl has an attitude the whole book through. Still dealing with her love triangle and political battles Katniss is put up to a challenge like no other to become the face of a rebellion. Never one for cameras or following directions she finds herself in huge mess.   While there are twists in every chapter there are parts that become hard to follow. All of a sudden the reader is inundated with the behind the scenes information from the rebellion, but like Katniss should be able to vaguely comprehend.   A lot of the end storyline is a little iffy. Do not want to give any spoilers, but one will be left wondering if there was merit to all the actions or if people have just gone nus throughout the series.   Overall I was happy i purchased the series
B004X80QNG|5.0|Great app on most Droids, not the fire though. Clearly says it uses the Android calendar database which the fire doesn't have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the first in what I think is an amazing trilogy, written for teens through young adults probably, but I can see adults of all ages interested in it. While the romance stories may seem childish the political and horrific scenes can be easy to relate to.   The best part about this whole series is that the end of each chapter leaves you begging for more. It is so hard to put down.   Katniss Everdeen is forced away from her life and family to be part of the Capitols Hunger Games. She along with a male tribute Peeta, from her District 12 are forced to compete to the death against other children (ages 12-18) from 11 other districts. All for pure entertainment. She deals with growing up, battling and falling in love, or is it? Katniss is full of energy and fire that is hard to ignore and quite entertaining.   Over all great book and great read.
B005Z271Y6|4.0|I love the CD/DVD with the exception that it skips on both CD/DVD and the quality for Blue Ray is horrible but the music and performance is AWESOME.
0545310598|4.0|Thankfully, I had the whole series on my Kindle at once because as soon as I finished the first one in the trilogy I immediately had to move on to this one.<br />Katniss and Peeta are dealing with being the winning tributes from the Hunger Games. Unfortunately Katniss has upset the Capitol by her poison berry trick at the end of the first book. Dealing with the continuous love triangle between Peeta, Gale and herself does not allow any stress relief for this teen.  Doesn't help that President Snow from the Capitol throws out the elephant in the room, does she truly love Peeta or was it all a Hoax to upstage the Capitol.<br />Conveniently, in Katniss's lifetime there is the Quarter Quell which is an upstaged Hunger Games held every 25 years. While the continous brutality to the citizens of Panem is still disturbing as well as the general idea of the Games, the book itself is a page turner. A little slow in parts bit still Suzanne Collins is great at leaving each chapter ending with oneliners that force you to turn page after page.

0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card claims Speaker for the Dead is the book he had always wanted to write, while Ender's Game was merely the intro. Having read both, I agree. Speaker for the Dead is a wonderful, thought provoking book about religion,speaking moral truth, and what being an alien really means. While it's clear early on that not all is what it seems, the actual resolution takes a surprising turn. I particularly like the implicit comparison between the alien culture and Christian beliefs. The aliens have a truly unique life cycle and their culture seems, well, alien - which is a relief compared to the many humanoid aliens gracing the pages of science fiction novels. Overall, highly recommended if you like thinking about questions of morality and human contact with aliens.

B002LLE3PY|5.0|Lizard is quite possibly the most ambitious, complex, and challenging album ever produced under the \\"rock\\" banner. Forty years out, it remains extraordinary. It flaunts countless ideas--classical grandeur, jazzical meanderings, cinematic soundscapes, precious melodies, soaring arpeggios, along with a good dose of the ominous mellotron and frenzied drumming that characterized the first two Crimson records. It was never popular, and the principals felt it missed its mark. But what a mark! Casual listeners may be baffled or put off, but for the musical adventurer who is drawn to the highest peaks in the history of the genre, Lizard is a must.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is the perfect weather app.  I use this instead of the news.  It has everything - radar that loops, current weather, hour by hour, 15 day outlook and alerts for warnings and watches.  You can't beat this one.
B0062P332Y|5.0|I loved this film so much!!!!!! The Killer Elite kicks ass from the opening and never lets up till the ending! I wasn't even a huge Statham fan before I saw Killer but I am now. I watched it because De Niro and Clive Owens are two of my favorite actors - and totally deliver in the movie!   The script is smart and original (and really funny at points - there's one amazing diss by Statham that still cracks me up) and the action scenes were directed perfectly! I kept saying how did they do that?!?!? It's definitely the kind of film to own and watch on Blu-ray over and over.  The only negative thing I can think of is I wasn't a huge fan of the Scorpion's song in the trailer, but that's about all. And who cares about the trailer. Get this movie on Blu-Ray and you'll love it.

1451627289|5.0|An excellent Stephen King that I enjoyed very much , I was a little afraid that the theme would be a little too-american , being an European but that was okay and I found very interesting when Jake observe the Oswald family .  I liked very much the love affair between Sadie and Jake , an another women in a King's book who bites the dust ...  I was glad and found myself smiling at all the little french expressions or word used in the book . I felt that King really enjoyed to describe the world in 2011 when Jake came back , he usually have some problems with endings but this one was pretty good .  I felt that Jake was leading towards bad days and that the novel will finish badly but couldn't stop reading , it took me a little less than three weeks , sometimes a little difficult because of the expressions (english is not my native tongue) but that was okay  I was not really interested about the play but that was okay , too  All in all an excellent book that kept me reading , I liked Jape Epping but I recognize that I loved best Dale Barbara from Under the Dome  Merci M.King

It will be cheaper for us to buy a new one then to get a replacement from them.  The customer service is horrible.

0345505387|5.0|If you are a Diana Gabaldon fan this is a nice addition to your collection. I read the book in one evening. It was really neat to see the photos with the story line. This only covers a porition of her first book Outlander. It gives the story from Jamie's and Murtough's view. The art work was beautiful and the artist well choosen. I would have loved to have read the entire collection through this format. This is comic book type reading so not having the best eye sight made it a little hard in places. If you choose to purchase this book keep in mind this is some one else's interpretation of what the characters looked like. For the thousands of readers who follow Diana  there are thousands of images of what each of our beloved characters look like.

079073804X|5.0|THE EXCORSIST<br /><br />What could be considered the scariest horror movie ever made, The Exorcist certainly injected a unique twist into the genre.  The idea of a movie that focuses on the demonic possession of a little girl is innovative to say the least, but The Exorcist took the concept to an entirely new level not just in its special effects and shocking visuals and language, but also in its religious, philosophical, and psychological pondering as well.<br /><br />The plot can be boiled down rather simply.  Young Regan is entering puberty and has a neglectful father, and begins to show some odd behavior.  Naturally mom and doctors look for a physical cause, but as things get stranger mom begins to believe Regan is possessed and contacts a priest.  Father Karras is at fist skeptical, but as the evidence builds, he too comes to believe and permission for an exorcism is granted.<br /><br />What is great about this plot is how is moves deliberately and slowly towards its conclusion.  Regan's possession resembles an illness where the symptoms become progressively worse and more mysterious.  Even the priest Father Karras doesn't believe Regan's demonic episode, blaming it instead on psychological issues.  But by taking its time the movie is much more effective cause it becomes steadily more creepy and shocking.<br /><br />Another benefit to this pacing is that it creates an ensemble of believable characters.  Father Karras comes off as a real person rather than as some faceless priest about to do battle with evil.  Lets face it, anybody would react with suspicion and doubt in a similar circumstance.  So too does Regan's mom, Chris.  In fact, she gives an absolutely convincing performance as time goes on and her daughter gets worse and it makes the viewer sympathize more for her dilemma.<br /><br />But it's the possessed Regan that steals the show.  Her behavior is outrageous as the demon takes control of her and her body begins to show signs of decay and abuse.  Horrible odors and sounds emanate from her, objects fly through the air, the temperature becomes ice cold--it's just terrible!  Most of the most memorable parts of the movie are involving Regan, some of the dialogue is delightful, and of coarse when we get to the exorcism, the special effects really kick into overdrive.  They are really well done and add a convincing element of creepiness to the possessed Regan, but you have to see them to really appreciate it.<br /><br />Aside from the makeup, the camera work is also spectacular in the way all the scenes are shot.  When we are away from Regan, the shots are wide and open which creates a feeling of emptiness and void, a fact that parallels the loneliness most of the characters have.  Then there are the shots inside the room with Regan.  These tend to be dark and smoky with lots of poor lighting to create a hellish scene and build the suspense of what is about to happen.<br /><br />Most neglected in the film are the deep psychological issues it explores.  Everybody is emotionally damaged, just in their own ways.  Aside from Chris and Regan, we see deficiencies in nearly everyone.  Father Karras is especially hurt as he deals with his ill mother, feelings of regret, inferiority, failure, and worse, his own lack of faith.  It is interesting to note that the two most damaged people (Regan and Karras) are the two individuals most affected by the demon, as if it feeds on such frailties.  It is also worthy to note that it takes the appearance of a demon to inspire faith in Chris and Karras rather than the word of the Lord, but it is so often the case that people's faith is not inspired by good, but rather by the bad in life.<br /><br />Perhaps the best aspect of the film is its utterly chilling atmosphere.  The concept of facing demonic powers is bad enough, but the entire film feels oppressive and threatening.  There are many parts of the film when for no good reason at all you'll find yourself feeling a scene of dread or heightened tension.  It starts to feel like the demons have taken over entirely and that each step may bring us just a bit closer to that evil.  It's safe to say there are very few parts when you'll feel at ease.<br /><br />The Exorcist is a great blend of ingredients that makes a spectacular film.  It doesn't set out to simply shock or frighten, but instead paints a picture that isn't complete until all the elements have come together.  This is why The Exorcist is still so effective and why it is simply the greatest film dealing with the subject of possession to this day.ly and that each step may bring us just a bit closer to that evil.

B005KXT58U|5.0|Fallen is probably my all time favorite album. I became a fan of them as soon as I heard it for the first time. After that, I kind of lost hope, as I didn't care for their other albums. This album came out and I wanted to get it, but was a little unsure about it. I didn't want to spend $11 for another open door, which I didn't really care for. Well, Amazon had the album download for $4 like 3 days ago and decided to get it at that time. I really like most of the songs. There are some that I don't like, but as I listen to them more, they are growing on me. There probably won't be another album like Fallen, but for my taste, this is second best. Right now tracks 3 and 4 are my fav. Enjoy!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This new 50th anniversary restoration on blu-ray is spectacular.   One of the disadvantages of living with a beloved movie for 4 decades, in the movie theater and on home video, is that it becomes so familiar that you know everything by heart and anticipate every next step. The script is brilliant, so, like most Hitchcock, it is enjoyable to watch repeatedly, even if familiar with the story. The great thing with Hitchcock is, that the suspense and excitement of the story have nothing to do with the revelation of a twist.   Were I new to this film, I would be ecstatic with the previous DVD, which remains excellent.  But such is the new clarity in this new restoration, that to me it was  like seeing a  different film, because I saw so many details that I had overlooked before, as in the interior of the dining car, or the lobby of the Plaza Hotel. It was, as if I were transported into the 1950s, being present in the very locations, not just watching them in a film. Textures become tactile, I can feel the cold of the steel fixtures in the dining car, the warmth of velvet, the surface of the rose patterned taffeta dress. For the first time, the metallic telephones at the lobby of the Plaza Hotel felt appropriately rich, crafted of real metal, befitting the exclusive surroundings. Before I always thought they looked out of place, common plastic phones covered with cheap metallic paint. It makes much more sense now.  This newfound immediacy went so far, that sometimes I had the feeling of being on the set while this movie was being filmed. Being present with the actors. However I didn't find it distracting, but let me enjoy the movie in a new dimension.  In this (and only this) film, Eva Marie Saint always reminded me of a stunningly beautiful pure-bred creature,  desireable and expensive,  and too synthetic to be a real woman, which I'm sure was intended by the director and appropriate to the story. Actually that look is not unlike Kim Kardashian's look today, a beautiful, perfect but synthetic mask.   In this new 50th anniversary restoration, the character Eva Marie Saint plays is suddenly a woman of flesh and blood. The  mask of  concealer makeup which Hitchcock placed over her face is still extreme, but no longer opaque enough to cover the freshness and human warmth, sensitivity and  vulnerability  I normally connect this favorite actress with. It is a revelation to now be able to see the subtle emotions in her face, like in the scene when she sends Cary Grant to the his doom in the crop fields. Her emotional conflict is very moving.   The love scene in the train compartment is stylized as ever; they kiss, but their embrace feels synthetic, with her barely touching his neck and his hands strangely hovering behind her hair, not lovingly, nor careful of messing up her superb hair (which gets messed up nonetheless by the wall), but as if something unappealing were back there. Her featherlight hesitant  tenderness is appropriate to the story --- but his hand's gestures have always irritated me. I'm sure both actors were following Hitchock's exact directions. And maybe it was Cary Grant's own style of touching his partner during romantic moments, because I've seen him do it in other films as well.  However, this new transfer with its focus on light and dark, makes this love scene much more intimate, by partially obscuring graphic details, which the previous transfer offered --- dvdbeaver.com (*) link below)  did  a comparison of the previous dvd with the blu-ray, and in the screenshot of this love scene,  you can see every detail in Cary Grant's hair on the dvd, whereas the blu-ray bathes it in shadow. I'm not sure why this happened, and I read that some reviewers were bothered by the darker image because it dampens the romantic mood. I like the new transfer better, because it makes the scene more convincing and natural, and appropriately ominous.  In any case, the sublime music which underscores this scene is the loveliest music I've ever heard in any film, and what the lovers avoid doing, the music does for them: it touches and embraces them (and us) with supreme tenderness and longing.  I very much recommend you watch this classic movie in this stunning new restauration; it's likely you will experience it anew, as I did.   My guess is, the new DVD edition of this 50th anniversary restoration will also be excellent, giving similar improvements over the previous DVD. I think the revelation lies in the restauration itself.   (*)  [...]

014050639X|4.0|This was purchased for my 4-year old daughter. She thoroughly enjoys it. It's a cute, shorter book. The rhymes and finding the characters make it a charming book to add to any book collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the minute I began this book until the end of the third, I don't remember doing anything else.<br /><br />Too easy to give away spoilers, so I won't discuss the story too much.  The story not as far-fetched as she makes it seem.  Our American amazement with more and more graphic reality television is just a stepping stone to lunacy like The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Katniss is the sort of girl, brave and strong, that you hope your own daughter grows up to be.
0385534639|5.0|This story is magical! I was immediately invested in it and the characters. Morgensterns writing is very intelligent and vivid. It's definitely one that can't be put down. But I found myself reading slowly because I didn't want it to end. Very few times have I wanted to start reading a book from the beginning the second I've finished it, but I did exactly that with The Night Circus. It's one that leaves you thinking about it long after it's over.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun the ads are not. children should be supervised while playing due to random ads for free points popping up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is wonderful and totally worth the download. but lets be honest, I only came back and rated because I wanted the extra points it gives you. xDD
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a good app you have to play each game to unlock the rest of the games that's the only thing that sucks
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love this game!  Just make sure to read directions before you play the games.  It never gets old and you can play for hours!

014241543X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was engrossing and well-paced, and I really liked Mia as a character. I was impressed that she truly seemed to grow over the course of the story, even though it takes place over just a few days. I empathized with her struggle in making a very difficult decision in the face of so much tragedy. Forman did a wonderful job handling Mia's emotions - there was never a point where things felt corny or<br /><br />I thought the supporting characters were well-developed and likeable. I wanted to know more about Mia's friend Kim, and I found myself hoping for her to have more of a voice in the next book. I found myself getting invested in the characters and I liked them so much that it made me root for a positive outcome for Mia even more.<br /><br />All in all, I thought this was a great story and thoroughly readable. I've already ordered the next book and I can't wait to read it. I'd give If I Stay an enthusiastic 5/5.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game.. I can spend hours and hours playing this game. Really good for people with add or adhd cause of the many mini games inside.
0525478817|5.0|The reason my head hurts is because I got this booked sent to me (signed copy!) and proceeded to sit down today and just read. I didn't stop I just read because I could not put the book down. Another amazing book by John Green as someone who is only 20 I was just a teenager and can relate to many of his books. This is a must read for any nerd fighter and anyone who loves his previous work. If you have never read John Green this is a great book to be introduced to with. When I read it I just kept thinking about Esther the entire time R.I.A

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I really enjoyed this when it was first issued, but I was overwhelmed by the clarity of both sound and picture in this remastered edition. The extra tracks were a real bonus.

B001HN6922|5.0|My son loves this movie. He always watched the first movie over and over and over again. It never got old to him. However, me I had it remembered by heart. Lol. Great movie thought. Worth buying.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good app my problem is it doesn't give directions for each game it gets confusing other than that its a good game
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I read this book on my Kindle Fire and it looked beautiful with the old photos and handwritten notes. Those inclusions are one of the features of this book that make it unique. I'll admit they were one of the reasons I looked into this book, but, as it turns out, the photos are really just a clever hook.  I found they distracted from the reading somewhat. There are times when you are reading an exciting passage, picturing a vivid scene in your mind, and are suddenly stopped mid-thought and given a picture to look at. I think the author would have been wise to include perhaps one picture at the beginning of each chapter, rather than dispersed somewhat haphazardly throughout.  As far as the actual story, it started out as kind of a mystery, got a little creepy, then a little weird, and ended up quite something else all together. I enjoyed some of the bizarre events, but, as I mentioned, felt the 'real' photos distracted. Don't think this is a book that is meant to pas as a true / ghost story or anything. A great read, very satisfying, but not perfect. This would probably be a 5 star book if the photos were integrated in a more thoughtful manner.

B006VA3ZT6|5.0|This is a really good show.  I enjoyed being introduced to the family in season 1 and am interested to see how they fare through WWI.  You can watch season 2 for FREE on PBS.com.  I highly recommend going there instead of paying for it on Amazon.
B004M3H17Q|5.0|I was browsing the Top Album lists for 2011 on Amazon and came across this album. I sampled some tracks and decided to make the purchase to see what it's all about. I like electronic music so why not? When I started listening to it, it was kind of laughable. What weird stuff. It had some catchy beats and effects and the sub hits hard and good. The album was more of a novelty than something I would listen to often. I spent a good 5 hours listening to this front to back.  Fast forward three weeks later. I decided to listen to some music at work and saw this album in my list. I was like why not. The bass will sound good with my Beats. Holy Mother! This album is really good. I am absolutely loving it. Listening to it now is like coming across an old friend. I am really glad I purchased this.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|would never call myself a huge fan of JP, loved Hell bent for leather, British  steel and Stained glass. After those three classic albums I beleive they lost themselves to that overdone metal sound that they became famous for (boring). Nostradamus on the other hand is a breath of fresh air, its the best album I have heard in years, I can not stop playing it every time something new stands out. The use of Synf/keyboards is superb and something JP should have used more on previous albums. The lead is the best and must have taken forever to record and get right. No songs stand out as the whole album goes from classic song to classic song with no weakness at all.  If your new to JD or arnt really into them, them I suggest you start here it doesnt get any better, I have a CD/record collection close to 1000 and this album is in the top ten.

B0032FPVKE|5.0|I've gone through about 3 bags now before finding what I consider a perfect fit for my [[ASIN:B005HQ50SO Panasonic DMC-FZ150K ]]. The main pocket will hold the camera snug face down, which is exactly what I was looking for. I originally purchased a [[ASIN:B002P3KY7E Lowepro Adventura 140]] case & was content on using that but the main pocket just had too much room making me weary about the camera being able to shift around during transport. This bag will fit the FZ150 very snug, with almost no ceiling room, making me feel much more comfortable during transport. The pockets are large enough for me to carry the charger & a [[ASIN:B004EDPYHI RainbowImaging 100 Meter 2.4GHz Wireless Remote Shutter Release]]. The only problem is there is absolutely no more room after carrying the camera, charger & shutter release. I wish Amazon, along with almost every other camera bag manufacturer would design their bags so that the side pockets have more room. This bag will eat up space in the main compartment if you fill the outer pockets. This makes my FZ150 go from a snug fit to a very tight fit. Sure the camera would fit perfectly if there was nothing in the side pockets but that kind of defeats the purpose of having side pockets if you can't utilize them without compromising space in the inner compartment. For this I would have taken off 1 star, but really this is a problem I've seen in every other camera bag I've owned.  The Lowepro was a little better at utilizing the side pockets, but it was also an overall larger bag, so even when it did take up space in the inner compartment there was still plenty of room left over to hold the camera & my charger in the inner compartment.<br />UPDATE 4/13/2013<br />After purchasing some additional accessories for my now FZ200 (including the shutter release mentioned above, additional batteries, shotgun mic, & a AC Power Adapter kit) this bag no longer has enough room to carry everything. I have since upgraded to a [[ASIN:B005VTIMEQ AmazonBasics Sling Backpack for SLR Cameras]] for the additional room. The [[ASIN:B002P3KY7E Lowepro Adventura 140 Bag]] I mentioned above is also too small to hold all of the accessories I own. This is a great case if you do not use any accessories with your FZ150/FZ200. Otherwise I would suggest either of the two camera bags I have previously mentioned.cs Sling Backpack for SLR Cameras]] for the additional room.

B0002KZAKS|5.0|I compared these Behringer XM8500s mics to both Shure 57s and GLS Audio ES-58s using the same settings on the same channel on the mixer. These mics are built like a tank.  No rough edges, and a good solid feel to them.  Compared to the Sure 57, I'd say the XM8500 had a slightly better sound.  It blew the GLS mics out of the water. I now have 7 of them, and have been recommending these to all my musician friends.  Buy 'em while they're still cheap!
1600242405|4.0|The only bad thing was the first attempt at buying this was that part of it was not there. To explain: of the 20 CDs that make up this audiobook I received #1-13 and then #1-7 again... so I was short #14-20.  Amazon did make it as easy as possible to get a replacement, which did have all CDs #1-20.  Now for the review. I am only half was through but am finding this audiobook to be excellent. While the story does seem to ramble there is a rough chronological order,but I really wouldn't expect anything different from Keith Richards. The larger part of this collection of thoughts and happenings is read by Johnny Depp , which adds a great flair. With the other readers thrown in adds a great balance. Keith even reads some himself, which is very easy to understand (despite reputation),and adds some of the best emphasis to the words. His story is a fantastic modern history lesson of changing times. It shows what a little luck and a lot of determination will do for you.  Looking very forward to hearing the rest of the story.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Works just like it is stated. I do however wish that there was a manual zoom function (eg let me type in I want to zoom to 100%) and more importantly, NEEDS HARDWARE ACCELERATION ENABLED. Do love the app though; I prefer it to docs to go.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love this game, and would love to give it five stars, but I can't.  I can only get through a maximum of three levels before it freezes my Droid 3.  I don't enjoy having to pull my battery, and restating my phone.  Losing my progress was annoying, but I am fine replaying the levels.  How has there not been a single update for this game?  When it works this is a 5 star game, unfortunately it doesn't work that often.  I hope the folks at PopCap can do something about thst.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its a pretty fun, arcade-style game. you can literally spend hours unlocking levels on this game. and best of all - its free!

B002RSDW80|3.0|I knew nothing about Julia Child, Julie Powell or either of their life stories before I watched this movie. I absolutely loved the incredible Meryl Streep and her wonderful and joyful portrayal of Julia Child! It made me want to learn more about Julia Child, look up her cookbooks and even try out a recipe or two. Ms. Child seemed to have quite a fascinating, full, adventurous life, from her world travels to her marriage to her cookbook publishing, etc. Ms. Child seemed like a person I would love to meet and have dinner with some day. Her life was very inspiring to me. Now, Julie Powell? Not so much. Ms. Powell comes across as a self-absorbed, whiny narcissist whose so-called \\"accomplishment\\" is nothing more than attempting to gain recognition for herself by following a lot recipes written by someone else in what would best be described as an attention-seeking stunt.  I feel sorry for Ms. Child that this movie was made this way. Julia Child deserved a biographical movie made about her -- and her alone -- without the interspersing the \\"story\\" of a rather immature woman whose only claim to fame is being a blogger who tried to follow a bunch of Julia Child's recipes. If you google Julie Powell, you will see that some of her blogs are still on the web -- full of profanity, misspellings, and yes, more whining. Poor Julia Child -- no wonder she was no fan of Ms. Powell and her blog.

B0063GORYU|4.0|It plays just like the Windows spider solitaire game does.  The only issue that I have found so far is when the next set of cards is dished out and an ace lands on a column that has a sequence of King through two.  The completed sequence remains on the column and you have to move one or more cards to another sequence and then back before the column rolls off.    I would have given it a 5 star otherwise.  Good game.

B000WS4OZM|5.0|Johnny Cash / Solitary Man / American III (American Recordings):  This third album for American Recordings is a mixture of band driven songs and `unplugged' performances.  The songs vary from Country Classics to Rock to Tin-pan alley to American Standards to Folk.  With such a variety, it is amazing how consistent and brilliant this album is.  Having worked so closely with Tom Petty on the previous album, Johnny starts with his own version of Petty's \\"I Won't Back Down\\", on which Petty sings harmony.  Johnny's version of U2's \\"One\\" may be the best of any ever made.  \\"The Mercy Seat\\" is an epic song and the rest of the album is equally wonderful but Johnny's poor health is evident again in the occasional weakness of his voice.  The success of the previous two CD's had brought out the great musicians that came to partly help and partly bask in that success.  Among the musicians on this one are Sheryl Crow, Merle Haggard, Randy Scruggs, Marty Stuart, Petty, and several others.  This, as the previous albums, deserves a Sixth Star.
0060763280|5.0|This is a book that should be studied by all.  You should apply what this book states and I am sure it can change you.  I am trying to apply the things that it states in my life, so I can change for the better.  The information given is unbelievable.
B004GHBQPG|5.0|Johnny Cash / A Hundred Highways / American V (American Recordings): This album is painfully good.  The man had lost his wife (June Carter Cash) and in this CD he sings of loss, faith, and love.  The loss of June and his own impending death shows in his nearly tortured voice and yet, he gives us this gift of pure brilliance. Johnny finished his vocals but died before the album was completed.  The huge hit here is his \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\" which is a warning to repentance that in 2011 was (inexplicably) being used as the background of a television car commercial (some folks never learn).  This is another Masterpiece.  This one deserves a Sixth Star.
B004LWZW42|5.0|X-Men: First Class is a return to the comic's roots and it's so good that it will make you forget all that came before.<br /><br />Launching a realistic superhero series is tricky.  Despite the mainstream popularity of the superhero genre in movies, there are still limits to what the general viewing audience is willing to accept.  As superhero franchises get long in the tooth, they tend to loosen up and start exploring the more extreme aspects of the genre.  Because the fringe elements of superheroes are not considered when planning the franchise, the movies also tend to become muddled and incoherent. For examples, see the Spider-Man and X-Men series.  This is why it's become fashionable to reboot the franchise and the second time around include all those disparate elements from the beginning.<br /><br />What First Class does right is give the series a sense of history. Although the various characters are important, they take a back seat to the go-go 60s, government paranoia, and the Cuban Missile Crisis. We begin with Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender as Magneto) in the grip of Nazi scientist Dr. Klaus Schmidt (THE Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw). Paralleling Lensherr's nightmarish upbringing is Charles Xavier (James McAvoy as Professor X) adopting a homeless shapeshifter named Raven Darkholme (Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique). Xavier's research in mutations is eventually co-opted by Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), a CIA agent who believes that mutants are a threat.  Division X is launched to counter the nefarious warmongering of Sebastian Shaw (SPOILER CLASS: actually Klaus Schmidt).  Xavier and Lensherr's worlds collide when they converge on Shaw, who escapes. Their alliance is one of convenience; they both want to capture Shaw for different reasons.<br /><br />The movie pivots on their differing ethos: Xavier is a horndog academic with noble ideas; Lensherr is a bloodthirsty fugitive hellbent on revenge.  Who is right?  It doesn't matter in the end. There are mutants and non-mutants, pro-government and against, those who remember the lessons of a world war and those who are doomed to repeat it. It's all about justifying the side you choose.<br /><br />As Shaw inches the Soviet Union and United States toward war, X-Men: First Class takes the gloves off.  Mutants are murdered (those mutants you don't recognize?  Yeah, those are the ones), vengeance is served, and CIA agents drop hundreds of feet to their deaths.<br /><br />First Class has fun tweaking our knowledge of future events in the X-Men universe.  It all culminates in the Cuban Missile Crisis. My father was on the flagship of the fleet positioned to block during the Crisis, so the events have a special resonance with me.<br /><br />Academic vs. warrior, U.S. vs. Russia, human vs. mutant...First Class manages to have its mutated cake and eat it too - by setting the series in the past it takes world-shaking events and balances them on the head of an emotional pin. The first three installments pale in comparison.nment and against, those who remember the lessons of a world war and those who are doomed to repeat it. It's all about justifying the side you choose.

B000002C2E|5.0|Bob Dylan / Time Out Of Mind:  Dylan's time looking into the oldest of recordings finally pays off for his fans in this remarkable album as he has taken what he has learned and returned to song writing in a glorious way.  Daniel Lanois produces this one with a particular sound in mind, which sometimes helps and sometimes hurts the music and lyrics, but there is no doubt that this is a Great album.  This is an album about Love, in it or out of it, but seeing the pain of both sides of it.  Five Stars
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Similar to gotomypc, one of my favorites. Only reason for four stars instead of five is because my reference is gotomypc. Naturally it is comparatively limited. That said, it is great. I love being able to access my office desktop and personal laptop from about anywhere. I can have full functionality on my K-Fire, which is slick.  The interface is a bit clunky and can be challenging. Perhaps future versions may improve that.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill / The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill:  An obvious fan of the soul of Marvin Gaye and the power of Stevie Wonder, Lauryn Hill mixes that past with the beat of late 90's Hip-hop and creates a wonderful and enjoyable sound.  That sound is then made part of a brilliantly devastating set of lyrics that turn this album into one of the Greatest of the era.  Five Stars.
0736092269|5.0|I have been into weight training for over 30 years and rate this book the best I have seen by far of it's sort. Bought it for my son who is starting out and wish I'd got two.
B000002LMM|5.0|Angelo Badalamenti / Julee Cruise / Soundtrack from Twin Peaks:  This first CD of the great mood music of the series Twin Peaks is excellent but short at only 11 tracks.  The experience of these tracks is excellent, but the experience is made much better if you also buy the much longer \\"Twin Peaks Season Two and beyond\\" CD.  Having both, I like to play them in reverse order, ending with Julee Cruise singing \\"Falling\\".  This first Twin Peaks soundtrack gets Five Stars.
0857680986|5.0|I just reviewed \\"Drawing the Head and Hands\\" and will say the same things about this reprint.It is very well done. I gave it as a gift, it's a full size hardback reprint. My son, the artist, loved it. These reprints are the best ones I've ever seen.
B00008IAMD|5.0|Johnny Cash / The Man Comes Around / American IV (American Recordings - CD with bonus DVD):  Be sure to get the version of this album with the DVD that has the perfect video of \\"Hurt\\".  This CD has some of the best and worst of the American series.  With Johnny's great version of the Nine Inch Nails song \\"Hurt\\", his version of the oft covered song \\"Personal Jesus\\" (which was first done by Depeche Mode), and Richard Thompson's \\"Tear Stained Letter\\", this album has some of Johnny's best work.  However, this album also has two nearly unlistenable songs, namely his versions of \\"Bridge over troubled water\\" and \\"in my life\\".  Despite those two very bad songs, this album still contains so much great stuff that it rates Five Stars.

B000002MZ9|5.0|Neil Young / Mirror Ball:  Some make a big deal of the fact that Pearl Jam is Neil's backing band on this CD but Pearl Jam were merely playing as the band they always wanted to be...Crazy Horse.  So some Neil fans complain about the presence of a grunge band and some Pearl Jam fans complain that it's not a Pearl Jam album.  Idiots both!  This is a Great Neil Young album and Pearl Jam did themselves proud in helping to create it.  This one gets Five Stars.

B000W4HFY8|5.0|Angelo Badalamenti / David Lynch / Twin Peaks Music / Season Two Music and more:  This second CD of Twin Peaks music is an essential, and longer, add on to the first season CD.  With a total of 22 tracks, this is filled with the wonderful music of the series.  Beautiful Five Star CD.
B0009A21R6|5.0|One of my all-time favorite albums, but now I hear things I totally missed before with this incredible SACD recording.  Two thumbs way up!
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana (the black album): Talented lead singer and writer made some excellent tunes mainly about being suicidal and then he committed suicide.  A nice collection of songs but it's tragic that a man who was screaming for help got `fans' instead.<br />Four Star collection.
0307593312|4.0|I have never read any of Murakami's works prior to reading 1Q84 and I loved it, despite what others say about staying away from 1Q84 if you're reading Murakami for the first time. I'll try my best to refrain from spoilers!   Some people say 1Q84 is repetitious and that the ending is disappointing. I beg to differ. True, there's a lot of repetition going on but you also have to keep in mind that there's A LOT going on in 1Q84 in general. I felt the repetition is used to help the reader remember what's important but with each repetition, you learn something different about that event or person. The repetition makes the important traits that define the characters and events memorable and fresh in your mind, so when something new unravels, you know in your mind the \\"thinking\\"/reason behind the new twist in the story. If you're a careful reader and read EVERYTHING (no skipping paragraphs), regarding the ending, you will see why the ending was the way it was. People might not like it because it wasn't \\"satisfying\\", not all the holes were filled but I felt that was the point. That's life. Not all strings get tied and there are always some left hanging. I believe that's one thing Murakami wanted to convey in 1Q84.  As a reader, you're literally thrown into the book. I admit it took me about 50-100 pages to really get a grip of where I am and that was when 1Q84 had me hooked. I got absorbed happened right away, completely off guard. Before I knew it, I was deeply engrossed in the world and characters of 1Q84.   As I mentioned before, there's A LOT going on in the book and 1Q84 is a pretty thick book. It took me 11 days to finish it because as a reader (especially in the beginning with 1Q84), there's just so much going on. But once you got the hang of it and see how all the strings are connected, it's smooth sailing from there.  I wanted to give this a 4 1/2 stars but I can only give it a 4 or 5. There are 2 minor things that bothered me about 1Q84:  1. The 3rd book. It's notbad but it starts off slow and I felt the start of it disturbed the flow left off from the 1st 2 books.  2. the COVER of this edition. I assume the girl on the cover is supposed to be Aomame, the heroine of the story. However, in 1Q84, Aomame is described as someone who has a \\"cool\\", sharp, mature face and wears no makeup! But here on the cover of this edition, she's clearly wearing makeup and her face is too round. The model on the cover looks like it could be the face of Fuka-Eri, a 17 year old girl. The girl on the cover does not look like the face of a 30 year old woman. I know it's not a big deal but it bothers me nonetheless (The backcover is an accurate picture of how I imagined Tengo so I have no complaints on it). It's misleading and doesn't follow the description of Aomame at all.   OVERALL -- I would recommend 1Q84 but to appreciate it to it's fullest, read it with an open mind.
B000002B35|4.0|Pink Floyd / Pulse:  Post Rodger Waters Pink Floyd group does an admirable and entertaining Concert.  This is a proper 2 CD live set to use to mark the end of the 1990's and the end of a band's brilliant career and influence.  Four Star set

B0000027I6|4.0|Roger Waters / Amused To Death:  This is another excellently written attack on War and the idiotic precepts that bring War about.  While the writing is excellent, the musical performance is not as dynamic as the Pink Floyd albums.  This is, however, still a very good album and not only should it be heard and owned, it should be placed alongside The Wall and The Final Cut.  A four star album (4 ½)

B0031SCV46|3.0|I purchased one of these to use on the road with my Laptop.  My biggest complaint is that the keys are not level across the keyboard.  Some of the keys are higher than others.  (Not by much mind you) but it doesn't give you a sense of quality. It doesn't effect the playback but it just doesn't look right.  I have seen this reported by others and seems to be due to uneven spring tension.    The controllers have direct templates to work well with Reason, but not so good with the rest of my software.  I have to program each controller with the software itself for my other programs.  (Sonar, Project 5, Reaper, etc.)  It's probably not reasonable to think that M-Audio would build templates for every piece of software for such an inexpensive keyboard so this is a nit.    Overall I think M-Audio could have made this keyboard better.  It's not bad for the money but I don't believe it will last with long term use. It feels like a toy, not a serious keyboard controller.  I won't bother sending it back but I would consider spending more money for better quality if I did it over again.  I will also suspect M-Audio's quality control in future products.  I have seen their quality control go down hill over the past several years.    I guess you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|I did not expect to like this as I was a childhood fan of the POTA series. I detested the Tim Burton remake and did not expect much from this film. I was surprised at how well done it was throughout; entertaining, very well balanced in the use of CGI/Motion Capture and wonderfully artistic in its design. Highly recommended.

B00664AM5C|4.0|I'm a disaster movie junkie, so when I saw the trailer for this movie on television, I pre-ordered it from Amazon and waited anxiously for it to arrive. Amazon was able to ship it a bit earlier than I'd expected, which I greatly appreciated, and my husband and I settled in with our popcorn and started the movie with great anticipation. I won't spoil the movie for someone else who may have not yet watched it...I'll just say that although I did enjoy the movie, it was not what I expected.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|I won't rehash the summary of the book that others before me have done so well.  There are different things that I took issue with the book.  First, for such a well-regarded mystery author, the mystery in this book was truly disappointing.  It was anticlimatic.  I kept reading the book long after I lost genuine interest to at least see what happened in the woods, and I was left feeling underwhelmed by the result.  My second biggest complaint was the language, particularly the dialogue.  It felt forced to me as if P.D. James was trying to capture Austen's writing style and how people spoke in the early 1800s.  It didn't seem natural to me, and the dialogue itself, particularly the dialogue of the female characters, came off as ridiculous to me.  Also, the language and descriptions of the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy was frankly schmaltzy to me, something that I did not feel when reading the original P&P.  Another example:  I don't think the United States would have been referred to as \\"the New World.\\"  The book takes place almost 30 years after the start of the American Revolution--it wasn't new!  Third, the book was clever or comical or have any of the great witty exchanges of Austen!  So much is taken away from the genius of the characters, especially Elizabeth, when this is not included.  Perhaps this shows the biggest difference between Jane Austen and any others who try to emulate her.  Last, and perhaps my biggest complaint, is I felt that this story really cheapened the relationship between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  There are insinuations that Elizabeth married Darcy for his status and money, something I totally disagree with.  I hate that this book questioned the relationship between the two and how it came to be.  A friend who read the book did not feel as strongly as I do, but I thought this book was unfair to a great love story and the relationship between the couple.  I guess I didn't realize that I was a Pride and Prejudice purist until reading this book!

0385342063|4.0|What starts out as a fun, slightly quirky tale of a flaky character named Poppy Wyatt, who loses her engagement ring and then has her cell phone stolen, morphs slowly into a lot more.  Now we are on a journey about the connections we build through our technological devices.  [[ASIN:0385342063 I've Got Your Number: A Novel]] reeled me right in to the relationship slowly forming between two accidental acquaintances, via a found cell phone in a bin; and just when it seemed as though it would stay at the funny, quirky level, something deeper started happening.  Secrets, betrayals, and incidents of possible corporate sabotage emerge.<br /><br />As Poppy and her techno-buddy Sam gradually learn more about each other, what, if anything, will happen between them?  What will Poppy discover about her fianc&eacute; Magnus that could turn everything in a different direction?<br /><br />Even though my version of the book was an ARC, I want to share an excerpt that sums up how a small piece of another person's world, as seen via texts and e-mails, is just that.  A very small piece.<br /><br />In this excerpt, Poppy is drawing some conclusions, as she reflects on the e-mails and text messages she is privy to:<br /><br />\\"All this time I've thought I could see Sam's entire life.  But it wasn't his entire life, was it?  It was one in-box.  And I judged him on it.<br /><br />\\"He has friends.  He has a life.  He has a relationship with his family.  He has a whole load of stuff I have no idea about.  I was an idiot if I thought I'd got to know the whole story.  I know a single chapter.  That's all.\\"<br /><br />A reminder to all of us who rely on the impressions we glean through social networks, e-mails, and texts:  we are subjected to snippets of people, a version they choose to present to the world technologically.  What does all of this say about us?  And with this kind of communication, is there a way to form a real and lasting commitment?<br /><br />The story is told in Poppy's first person voice, and it didn't take very long for me to root for her.  I enjoyed this character even more than Kinsella's famous Becky Bloomwood.  I could relate to her in ways that I could not connect with Becky, even though I also adored that series.  There was one annoying aspect of the writing style that subtracted from my enjoyment:  An ongoing series of footnotes.

B0012GN3RI|5.0|I had to write a review of this metal classic thundersteel after getting upset seeing the three star reviews some people gave it and a guy giving it one star not even for its music content, he should delete his review. I am a huge riot fan and agree that narita and my personal favorite fire down under are awesome as well, and i love the early lineup with singer Guy Speranza R.I.P. but guitar god Mark Reale really moves into a different direction from early riot with thundersteel. This effort is much more agressive, progressive, and powerful especially with the double bass speed drumming of bobby j. Also new vocalist Tony Moore has a much higher pitch and extended range than previous riot vocalists.This was a comeback cd in 1988 after a five year absence. Mark Reale guitarist and founder has put together a whole new band lineup with this cd changing the genre to true POWERMETAL with Tony Moore vocals, Don Van Stavern bass, amazing speed drumming from Bobby(the drummachine)Jarzombeck and some of the best guitar chops, solos, and fills you will ever here from Reale. If you are a fan of powermetal and music that kicks ass and don't own thundersteel yet buy it now, thundersteel is classic powermetal at its best. Fans of Metallica,Megadeath,Maiden and Judas Priest will eat this cd up. TRUST ME. Its hard to believe this cd is 23 years old, it truly has stood the test of time. By the way Mark has done it again in 2011 with a thundersteel reunion cd Immortal Soul, which is amazing as well. Check it out. Thanks Mark Reale for all the great metal over the years.

4770031246|3.0|The book is beautifully produced, but its focus is nutrition rather than traditional recipes. If you're a major Japanese food fan, as I am, the book will be a disappointment.

B003V4AK8E|4.0|I've had this controller for a couple of weeks now and have used it pretty much each night to play MW3.  As an Xbox 360-style controller, this controller does a really nice job of behaving pretty close to the 360's controller.  The noticeable differences are two.  1.) the 360 seems a bit heavier, probably because of the battery.  Whether or not heavier is better is a matter of preference - at first, that it was lighter made me feel as though it was not the same quality but, after two weeks that thought has faded.  2.) the controller has perforated/rough sides to create more grip.  While this makes it feel a bit different than the 360 controller, it really is not that noticeable - it's not like I drop my 360 controller because of lack of grip.  Setup was simple but, not extremely simple.  I followed the directions to sync the controller but, for whatever reason it didn't sync until I reset the controller and restarted my PS3 - something not in the directions that I had to guess at.  It has synced flawlessly every time since then and syncs noticeably quicker than the 360 and even quicker than the original Sony controllers.  The lit ring is not as well done as the 360 as the light easily bleeds into the other ring quadrants.  My controller buttons randomly light up or not (the ring is always on).  They'll either light up the whole time I'm playing or not light up the whole time during a sync.  Not sure why but, it has not affected gameplay.  I've seen a few reviews complaining of lag and I do not notice any lag difference between this controller, the original PS3 or the Xbox 360 controllers (I've played MW3 with all of them).  The controller works very much like the PS3 or Xbox 360 controllers in terms of gameplay performance.  In terms of drawbacks, I inquired with Power A about a couple of things that turned out to be disappointing.  I like to have multiple controllers on stand-by (for friends, as backups, etc.).  So, I inquired to ask if I need to have a separate USB sync controller installed for each controller I want to use.  You do.  So, you'll only be able to have as many controllers as available slots that you have on the PS3.  In my case, I can only have two controllers.  Second, they do not make a charging stand for their controllers.  So, the only way to charge them is to use a USB slot and cable (doesn't have to be on the PS3) to charge them.  I don't know of any other charging stand that is sold that would work with these controllers.  Despite these limitations, I'm far happier using this controller than the PS3 controller.  The PS3 controller has too much play in the thumb sticks compared to this controller and the 360 controller.  The PS3 controller also pulls your thumbs apart far more than the 360 or Power A controller and is also too small if you have large hands.  It just doesn't feel as good in the hand as the 360 controller and the Power A controller.  I would recommend this controller - based on two weeks and around 20+ hours of gameplay.  Still feels as solid as day one - and it should for another year.  Hope it holds up.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|I absolutely loved the first Chickenfoot album and wondered if their sophomore effort would live up to my expectations. I can honestly say that Chickenfoot III has more than exceeded them! \\"III\\" has not left my CD player since the day of its release. The songwriting is more solid, the hooks grab you and never let go. Sammy, Mike, Joe and Chad really come together as a unit on this album and you can tell they are more comfortable in their union now. Highlights are too many to count. The negative for me is that there aren't more tracks, but that's because I can't get enough of Chickenfoot. Can't wait for the next collection, which at this point I'm guessing will be called...what... Chickenfoot V? :)

B00005NZBN|4.0|Bob Dylan / \\"Love and Theft\\" (2 CD special edition - released Sept. 11th, 2001):  Dylan's research into early American recordings in the 1990's had already shown their effect in \\"Time out of mind\\", but in \\"Love and Theft\\" Dylan actually recreates the feel of a 1930's performance, but with the usual Dylan brilliance in lyrics.  This is Dylan with his now gruff voice singing some very lighthearted tunes and the effect is playful.  However, this album was released the same morning that the 9/11 attacks occurred in New York and Washington, etc.  So this lighthearted album was barely noticed in the aftermath of that tragedy and, even if some knew about it, most were not in the mood for a lighthearted Dylan album for a very long time.  The album is fun but not a masterpiece.  This is a very strong Four Star release.<br /><br />This special edition carried a second CD which contained only Two songs:<br />- \\"I was young when I left home\\" from 1961 and<br />- an alternative version of \\"The Times They Are A Changin'\\"<br />  both are good, but add little to the experience of the \\"Love and Theft\\" album.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|The Beatles / Love:  Before I say anything else, you do know that this is a reworking and editing of classic Beatles songs created for a Cirque du Soleil performance, right?  I only ask because, apparently (judging from the 1 and 2 star reviews on this page) there are over 80 incredibly dull persons who bought this disk and then complained that this wasn't an `original' Beatles hit disc.  Please, if your looking for a greatest hits disc, this is NOT it.  Now, as to this George Martin re-imagining of the Beatles songs to fit into this `circus' performance, It's really very entertaining and refreshing.  I enjoyed the music very much.  Good job Mr. Martin!  It's not a masterpiece (as it was created for a circus) but it is worth hearing and owning.<br /> Four Stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app and use it almost everyday. So many options and nice to have bible in pocket...why is  there a min word count by amazon ?
B003YOXIVW|5.0|Peter Gabriel / So:  This is Gabriel's most beautiful set of songs, along with the one pop hit.  I have the fine 2002 remastered version but this 2010 remaster is newer and less expensive (as of 2012).  Five Stars
B003297I1U|5.0|My son (4 years old) has not stopped playing with this toy since Christmas morning, we are amazed at how high the crane extends.  The quality of the toy is excellent, I can tell it will stand the test of time unlike most other toys that break after a few months of hard use by little boys.  There are so many little details included like the pulley system used to raise and lower the crane and the legs that extend out to give it balance.  If you have a boy that is interested in trucks and construction equipment this is a must have.
B00004XQ83|5.0|O Brother, Where Art Thou? (music from the film):  This is a wonderful album of mainly new recordings of old American songs.  Hopefully this will continue to encourage people to seek out the recordings made by John and Alan Lomax who recorded the earliest versions of classic Country and Blues songs and performances.  If not that far, then hopefully as far back as the old blues records of Muddy Waters and the like, along with finding the works of country stars from the Grand Ole Opry.  As to the soundtrack, it is a Five Star album and a blessing to music education.
B005SJIP2S|5.0|Yes without Jon Anderson..............that is like Genesis without Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, and Ray Wilson............but the Band played on..............and as it was written, so shall it was done.................take the straight and longer course to the corners of your mind...........take me out to any black square, Squire, even if she hasn't got the time.........for the queen to use.....just remember long ago................
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I was not quite sure what to expect with the movie.  I had heard many good comments about the movie, so I thought I would go and see it.  I cannot tell you the impact this movie had on my wife and I.  I was not aware of some of the aspects of the bigotry and learned very quickly why we should have been embarrassed about this part of our history.  Presented uniquely , it gives us that side of the struggle for equality by the African Americans.  I recommend that everyone should see it and take away from it the notion that we should not ever allow anything like this happen again.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It's one of the most original fairytale re-takes I've read, yet it definitely has the Cinderella flavor. I love it that she's a mechanic--a greasy, disheveled mechanic. And the best mechanic in the land! It's perfect. I also love the mix of humanity, cyborg, robot, and Lunar peoples.<br /><br />I had a hard time deciding whether to give this a 4 or 5 star rating. Ultimately, I went with 4 stars because while it was a great read, it wasn't UN-PUT-DOWN-ABLE for me until the last 150 pages or so. Then . . .whoa! It all gets crazy intense and leaves us dying for book two!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I love this game! I play it almost every day! But when I beat the last level, it said there would be more levels soon... I WANT THRM NOW!!!!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is one of the best games i have ever played. There are so many games to choose from.If you are deciding between this game and another game pick this game.  - Review by my 10-year old son!

B0053VKP8S|5.0|Didn't want to buy a new surround souund reciever that had hdmi or optical, figured i'd give this a shot. I was wanting to run my ps3 optical to my stereo system so I baught this to give it a try. Works great, sound is clean. Using usb power from the playstation 3 itself so no additional power cords to run in the wall. I give it a five till proven wrong.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I have purchased several television series on DVD from Amazon.  Product has been received in excellent working condition.  The company has been very dependable.  Look forward to purchasing season 3 of Sons of Anarchy.
1419702238|5.0|Another great book from Jeff Kinny! Greg gets himself locked into a corner again from his mischeivious behavior. This book is so relatable to young boys.  There aren't too many books out there for this 10 - 13 year old group to get engrossed in. I think the books are fantastic and my son loves them. He can't wait for another episode!
1612130283|5.0|Oh my, I really have no clue where to begin with this review. I guess I can start by saying that Fifty Shades of Grey is out of my comfort zone. I don't read erotica stories, but my friend Yara at Once Upon A Twilight recommended it to me and went on and on about how much I would love it. Needless to say, she was right.<br /><br />I don't know how to put into words how I feel about this book other than I loved it! There were some scenes though that did make me want to stop reading, but I just COULDN'T. It was like a drug for me. I stayed up until 4 AM reading it. Every time I tried to put the book down, I picked it right back up and kept saying \\"one more chapter.\\" It was so addicting. It is so much more than just erotica and I think that was the reason why I enjoyed it so much. You get the romance part of it as well, and you learn about the characters and their past. It wasn't just about the sex. I got so sucked into the world of the characters and was so intrigued by Christian's life style that I knew I wasn't going to get any sleep until I finished the story.<br /><br />Even though there were some parts that bothered me, I still feel I should give this book a BIG five stars. The writing was great, the characters were amazing, and the story was a lot more than I expected. Plus, it is now two days later and I am still talking and thinking about it, especially the characters. I would go into details about what the book is about, but honestly, I don't think I will do it justice.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is a super-hot and steamy read. Also, it's very educational when it comes to um... certain things lol. If you're a romance lover like me, add this book to your TBR pile. It is worth every penny! Even if it's not something you would normally read, I say you need to try it. And like my friend told me, I promise you will love it!<br /><br />5 out of 5 Stars!
B005KTZ05G|4.0|This is by far the one of the best Ezio toys I have ever gotten. He comes with many extra pieces that are easy to lose. He has three sets of hands:open, fisted, and a combo of a partly closed hand and a hand that's ment to hold a sword. This is odd because he does not come with a sword. But this is a minor flaw. The hidden blades come out to a great length compared to the as2 figures. They are removable and because of this they are very loose. But that is almost no problem because of the amazing detail on the figure. The face is spot on! And Neca put every effort in to the outfit. I highly recommend this to any assassins creed brotherhood fan or just a fan of great figures.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|The discription says the application is &quot;Ad Supported&quot;.  What a scam.  Each of the 101 games cost a certain amount of in-game dollars.  In order to earn these in-game dollars you have to tap an ad and download/install another spam app.  This is the sort of Android style junk that I dreaded when I moved from my iPod touch to the Kindle Fire.  How did this reach the top of the charts?

1451648537|5.0|Reading this book was a journey for me, in not only getting to know who Steve Jobs was, but about the evolution of Apple, a distinctive corporate culture, and having a vision so powerful that it can change history. I am particularly fascinated with how Apple through Steve Job's vision and perfectionism was able to blend art and technology. This book was hard to put down. It's a must read for anyone interested in the life of a genius, and the inner workings of a company on the edge of innovation.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I did it first before letting my kids try..so many images are repeated,I flew through in less then ten minutes,no misses.  I then let my seven year old try he got 1 wrong and got it right on his second try,he completed it in about 12 minutes..my five year old got them all first try and finished in 13 minutes..my 3 year old daughter missed one. twice,but got the rest first try and finished in 20 minutes.
030726999X|4.0|While I have highly critical of the first two books in this series, this one deserves a round of applause. As the others so blantantly did, this novel did not continue to portray Salander as a comic-book hero, did not get into the mundane details of what each character had for breakfast nor what their Ikea shopping list was and did not go off on useless tangents that lead to dead-ends. The number of characters in this novel were a great deal more numerous than the previous two which kept the reader not only paying attention but interested in the character development. The plot, denoument and final climax of this book were superb. And while you knew that the good guys would win and the bad guys would eventually lose, you never were sure how this process would be pulled off. In his final novel, Stieg Larson finally had gotten over some the basic writing errors that he made early on and composed a well written murder mystery that kept his readers attentively turning page after page.
0765365278|5.0|Incredible beginning to an epic series.  I was a little bit hesitant about reading this book since I didn't enjoy Mistborn series at all, but this turned out to be a great book.  Interesting characters and original magic made this an enjoyable read.  Wasn't really sure I liked the whole spren and spirit thing at 1st, but it became more interesting as the book went along.  I can only hope Sanderson finishes up that \\"Turd\\" of a series by Robert Jordan, so he can get back to work on this real epic series.
1935251740|5.0|Occasionally a person can read a book that parallels his/her most recent thoughts on a given subject matter. This was such a book for me. The author, in a clear and convincing manner, shows that evolution did not in time create consciousness. Instead, consciousness has always been in existence and was present during the 'big bang'. Being so, this phenomenon leaves us with a series of interesting questions. What was the original level of consciousness? Was it primitive or advanced? Did this consciousness guide the process of evolution itself? Is there an end point that it is aiming towards, or have we already reached it? Other intriguing factors include the anomaly that reality itself is solely created by the presence of an observer, space and time are nothing more than meaningless human guidelines and are simply tools of the mind, the universe, without an observer, would merely exist in an undetermined state of wave probability, the universe is fine-tuned for life because consciousness and life created it that way, and that there is no absolute reality that exists independent of life.<br /><br />If you want a mind opening text that is easy to read and challenges your 'rock solid' view of particle physics this is the book for you. The answers of the questions of 'why and how' are out there and this book is a step towards finding the final answers to our age old queries.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|a really good app for the family!! Its also really fun to play at the office. has a lot of variety.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|ANOTHER GREAT MOVIE FOR A GREAT ACTOR. I LIKE ACTION MOVIES AND THIS ONE WAS A VERY ACTIVE FAST ACTION MOVIE. DEWAYNE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE STARS.

B005F3XV62|5.0|I ABSOLUTY LOVED THIS MOVIE. IT WAS SO FUNNY. KEVIN IS A GREAT ACTOR AND PLAYED THE PART SO WELL.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great Bible and great features but some editing issues and the dependency on a wifi. connection can frustrate the User on Kindle.
B001HN6918|4.0|WAS NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONE BUT WAS WORTH WATCHING. ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. WAS REFRESHING TO WATCH FOR A CHANGE.
1451627289|5.0|This book reminds me what drew me in to Mr. Kings books in the first place, back in the early 80's when I was a kid. His ability to draw in the reader, create characters and a setting that the reader becomes invested in, and then spin a story that draws you in even deeper, is unrivaled in modern fiction writers. 11/22/63 is just such a book.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing was the unsurpassed television series of our generation. Aaron Sorkin's vision of the institution of the Presidency borders on the sublime.<br />This work should be required in every classroom both here and abroad.<br />Bring a box of tissues with the popcorn, kickback and take a seven year ride with the cast and writing of a lifetime. . .<br />Donald[[ASIN:144015774X Blues to Blood: Doing It the Hard Way: Music, Addiction & Recovery]]
B005RUS78K|5.0|Thanks God scripted programs came back, enough of this 'reality tv' stuff.  Breaking Bad together with Justified, Game of Thorns, Revenge, Once Upon a Time, Homeland, Boardwalk Empire are just great quality, great acting, good ploys, great use of cameras, effects, music, costumes, etc.  Breaking Bad is ideal for a marathon day with pizza in bed: one after another.  Is almost impossible to wait to watch the next episode and cruel to make us wait from season to the next.
0525478817|5.0|I am a huge John Green fan. I think he is one of the most talented authors of our generation and his books are always wonderfully insightful, hilarious, and moving. I always come away from reading one of his books with at least five quoatations that I love and a story that sticks with me for a long time. That being said, \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is one of the most heartbreaking books I have ever read.   The book is about a sixteen year old named Hazel who is diagnosed with a terminal thyroid cancer that has metastasized to her lungs. She suffers from depression and attends a support group to help her deal with the suffering that comes with cancer. There she meets Augustus Waters, a boy who brings her back to the land of the living.   I am a big fan of books that evoke emotion but I rarely actually break down and cry. At some parts of this book I had to stop reading to pull myself together and remind myself that this was a fictional story, but that did not matter. Whether Hazel and Augustus are real or fictional you will fall in love with them and hate the universe that made their lives so difficult. The Fault in Our Stars is a wonderful work by a wonderful author.
B00664AM5C|4.0|An excellent disease procedural with fine performances from an outstanding cast. There's a distance to it, though. I never really felt any of these people or shared what they experienced. The cinematography is often dark and flat with faces hidden in shadow (almost looking like a digitally projected movie, though I decidedly saw it on film) which contributes to distancing the audience from the characters and their respective plights. Perhaps the DVD/Blu-Ray may improve on this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this daily. It is the absolute best on the market!!  The note taking, bookmarking, reading plans for every possible reason are unique, and user friendly!
B005ZCXFD2|4.0|A fine film about neighbors getting to know one another under trying circumstances. The film is honest, straightforward, and compassionate, with a sense of humor. The filmmakers admirably do not overreach, they tell their story directly and efficiently, moving from act to act without padding or unnecessary delay and thus accomplish much and accomplish it with style and aplomb.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Most excellent way to get into your needed info no matter where you are.  Has saved a lot of timerunning back and forth to retrieve data.
B006OFN0BQ|3.0|Fine performances. Some telling moments. Mostly, though, a disappointing example of muddled storytelling from a director who almost always gets it dead-on. Guess Clint Eastwood is only human after all.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|very versatile, fantastically  fast, completely comprehensive. just what I need! more effective than google docs for a wider variety of applications.
B005JE7WKI|4.0|This is so close to being amazing. They didn't \\"knock it out of the park\\", but did deliver a consistently fun, respectably gruesome, and regularly heartwarming movie. Not a bad accomplishment.   Definitely recommended if you love or hate horror movies and best seen knowing as little about the movie as possible - avoid the trailer if you can.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this can be fun for all ages and for people who like puzzles or I spy games.  the reason I wanna get this is that this awesome or its like an I spy book. so yeah get ti now
B006MQRLSA|5.0|An absolutely mesmerizing movie about statistical analysis. Steven Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have written a smart, funny movie that I found eminently entertaining even though I don't care about baseball. At all. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill deliver what could be difficult and cold dialog with wit and charm.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|very amusing and great time filler, nice variety of games, and the games are equally challenging in their own way.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I thought this ap was great but I didn't know it was a app for younger kids. I still thought it was great the only problem is it doesn't take long to beat
B000W91RUG|2.0|These DVDs are terrible quality! I started watching mine and could see all the pixels on first DVD. After that it was fine but now I have to hassle them to replace this item.
0393338827|5.0|Leave it to Michael Lewis to explain the sub-prime mortgage meltdown in terms that we laymen can understand.  More importantly, he chronicles the steps that three financial entities took to gamble that a debacle was coming and therefore profit from it.  These guys all recognized that the so-called financial experts weren't.  The real culprits, though, seem to have been the ratings agencies, Moody and Standard & Poor, who were feeding the frenzy with ridiculous AAA ratings on financial products made up of mortgages obtained by consumers who couldn't possibly afford them.  As always, Michael Lewis has examples that will blow your mind.  So how did anyone profit from the collapse of the bond market?  They bought insurance against it, in the form of a product called a credit default swap.  And, you ask, who would sell insurance on risky mortgages?  AIG, of course!  The three profiteers are a 3-man group called Cornwall Capital whose only investors were themselves, plus 2 hedge funds.  There's actually one more guy, Greg Lippmann, a trader at Deutsche Bank, who also foresaw what was about to go down, and bought some credit default swaps also.  He persevered in wooing one of the hedge funds, whose principals kept asking, \\"How are you going to f--- me?\\"  In short, the credit default swap buyers were very nervous that this opportunity couldn't possibly be real but invested millions anyway.  They reaped many more millions in returns.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Great application.  Makes Bible reading very convenient. Love the plans available.  Adjustable fonts for the plan readings would make the app even better.  Also wish our own notes could be displayed on a split screen when reading the Bible.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great game, you cant get bored with is beacause theirs more then one game its so amazing
0061474355|5.0|I remember reading this in elementary school and just loving it.  I really liked the idea of a fantasy world coexisting within our own.  This was before harry potter came out and while I enjoyed those books this one (and the series) is better IMHO.  The cool ideas of how death worked and the necromancy and anti-necromancy are just really creative and enjoyable. Awesome read - I would recommend this book to anyone!!
B006INDMEE|3.0|I downloaded the The Debt I got because I had some promotional credit to use and needed something to watch for a flight. Movie was very good and very suspenseful. I was glued to my Kindle screen while watching this and loved how it went back and forth between present and past to tell the story well done.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Bluray is the best.  Yes I have seen Hulk but I did not have the Bluray.  I played it on my ps3 and it was like a dream.  I am a fan of all the Marvel stuff.  Thinking about getting Captain America and Thor.  Already have Thor on DVD.  Thanks for the product!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Its a free application that is being given to you. A homeless person isnt going to complain if you give him a ham sandwich instead of a BLT sandwich. They are going to take it regardless of what type of sandwich it is. Its a damn free sandwich. If you aren't smart enough to figure that out then there really isn't any common sense sense left in this society. Can't believe people get upset about a free application when our economy and country is complete disaster.
0525478817|5.0|I've come to believe that good fiction helps the reader transcend the self. Good fictions become tools that are used to breach the consciousness and tap into the mechanisms of humanities inexhaustible spirit. The Fault in Our Stars is an example of such a work. The book is advertised under the \\"Young Adult\\" genre, and although it may contain hormonal sexual tension, intentional, and premeditated teenage angst, it presents very mature themes in an eloquent and exceedingly elaborate fashion. John does not underestimate the capabilities of his readers, often prompting them to address the complexities of everything from early 20th century poetry to existential nihilism. The Fault in Our Stars does an excellent job at addressing the hardships of suffrage. Do we become the things or events that hinder us, or do chart - and excuse my vague textual reference here - our own cosmic, ontological course? More important than its literary force and didactic subtleties, is the books ability to evoke raw emotion. I found myself tearing up several times throughout the book, and as a reader becoming empathetically involved with the characters. The highlight of the novel is Chapter Eighteen, a section - that without giving anything away - hurdled me through a climactic set of emotions, ranging from frustration, and powerlessness to unadulterated melancholic beauty. To say The Fault in Our Stars is a \\"Cancer Book\\" would be understating the prowess of this work. The Fault in Our Stars is a book that treats cancer as a living, breathing consequence, but not as its protagonist. The books concern is life and its many side affects; \\"life begets life.\\" Hazel is an insightful, smart anti-hero, who grapples with love and its many complexities with both dignified humor and crippling sadness, and such an attention should attract readers both young and old.  Without a doubt, the Fault in Our Stars is John's most accomplished piece of work that will inevitably attract and bear many awards by the years end.   5/5  DFTBA
0385534639|3.0|I think the author is incredibly talented; however, I found this book incredibly difficult to get through. The flowery writing was sometimes distracting and while she did a terrific job setting up the circus and the love struggle... I often found her verbal linguistics confusing. Overall, a solid story and I will read more from her... but I wasn't as impressed as I would have liked to be with this debut.
1423140591|5.0|Brace yourselves people because Percy Jackson is back!<br /><br />Walking up to find that he little to no memory, monsters are trying to kill him, and that he has no where to go, Percy is not his happiest.  Things get worse when he wakes to find some Goddess, if she even really counts, telling him to take her to a Roman camp and to carry her there.  Although glitched in the memory, Percy does seem to recall something about Gods and Godessess, but Roman?  When he reaches the camp, the kids there aren't very happy to see him.  He's a Greek and they don't think that he can be trusted.  But quickly, Percy proves to be quite the fighter and they can't help but feel impressed.<br /><br />Hazel has been there for some time too, but nobody's really impressed by her.  In fact people shy away from her and avoid her, except maybe Frank and now Percy.  They know she's a daughter of Pluto, but could they also be catching wind of her curse?<br /><br />Frank is a clumsy out of place camper.  He hasn't been claimed by his dad, nobody really trusts him and he's so awkward.  His life could end at any moment and he could be the one to do it.  Percy is a dream come true for Frank.  They seemed to work well together.<br /><br />Right of the bat, these three very different people are sent to lead a quest.  They've got a lot of weight on their shoulders considering the entire camp is relying on them.  And for Frank and Hazel this is only their first Quest?  Their mission is to save Death, and if you thought that seemed hard they have more on their plate; they are also avoiding their archenemy:  Gaea or Mother Earth.  To top it off, they're going to a place beyond the gods, a place where they are beyond help.<br /><br />The book was incredible.  It's so good to have Percy back in the series and he think that he's really made it more alive.  There was a lot of adventure and character build-up in this book.  It's a must read.
0451205766|5.0|wow. wow. wow. Had seen the film a bunch of times but never read the book. I literally devoured it. Puzo has some of the greatest characters in literature. I will buy this for everyone I know. A wonderful journey.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|And the book is a great resource to show how morally destitute religious teachings are.  Kill your son, and offer your daughters to be gang raped.  Destroy entire populations for worshipping the wrong god.  Where would we get our morals without this great work of fiction?
B003L77GG0|5.0|I love this show and season 10 is no exception. The only part I didn't like about season 10 was that it had to end lol. But the product was wrapped in a plastic wrap, signifying it was brand new. Awesome disc art. 5 out of 5 everytime!

0307477479|1.0|I picked this book up because I wanted to try a new author randomly. Goon Squad had won a Pulitzer Prize,  and that usually stood for a good book.<br /><br />Not.<br /><br />This book was unreadable for me. But it tricked me. I downloaded the free preview from Amazon and started reading the first chapter. Jennifer Egan is a fairly good writer using elegant description and dialog. The first chapter introduces Sasha, a kleptomaniac, in a session with her therapist in the current time. I was looking forward to the rest of the story and bought the book before I went on a backpacking outing where I'd need some reading material to keep my brain occupied through 14 hours of darkness in a small tent, when I  can only expect to sleep about eight hours.<br /><br />The second chapter went back in time, told from a different narrator.<br /><br />The third chapter went into the 1980 period when some of  the characters we met in chapter two were still in high school. This was narrated yet again by a different character. The book switched from the first to the third person narration randomly. Cohesiveness between the chapters lacked and there were so many different colorless and dull characters, it was difficult to keep them apart within each chapter, let alone over the course of the book.<br /><br />It took willpower to make it to 25 percent on the Kindle. Then I started fast-forwarding to see if there was something worthwhile coming up that would pull it all together for me. But it didn't happen. Reading this was not enjoyable. It was a drag, a truly abysmal reading experience. I don't have time for this.<br /><br />Impossible to read.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|YouTube and Hulu  are actually watchable through this. In terms of real-time audio and video this is the best Remote desktop app I have used so far on Android.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I thought that this was a cute little game. Some of the groupings didn't make sense,but overall I thought it was fine. I appreciate having a few children's apps for free. Thank you.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|I've long been a fan of Timbuk2. So when I saw these were available for my son's Kindlle Fire, I was happy! He really likes it, it's in his school colors. Great padding to keep the Fire protected.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm still working the first level, but it really gets my heart racing.  I'll add that I'm out of shape and it's nice working out in the privacy of my own home. I love that I don't need any equipment (except maybe a yoga mat and light weights)!
0060899220|3.0|For as many things as I found wrong with this book, there were at least as many that I found hilarious and crazy; enough to forgive Anthony Bourdain from being a world-class jackass, if the way his personality comes across in the book is any indication of his behavior in real life.  Out of the 300 pages in this book, I don't think there was even ONE that didn't include either 1) drugs, 2) sex, 3) cursing, 4) or insulting someone or something.  Granted, I do have a jaded/saracstic sense of humor myself so many of these jokes in his writing I found pretty funny (esp. the chapter on Adam not-sure-of-his-last-name which was ROLLICKING hilarious!)  But can the guy make a point without always bringing up the tons of drugs he's done in the past, who he did them with, when he did them, how many drugs he did and which types, EVERY SINGLE PAGE of the book?  It got to be a little tiring, and honestly my opinion of chefs now is one of pity and sadness if the rest of them are as wretched and objectionable as Tony Bourdain.  His attitude and personality were just such a huge turn-off, I couldn't make myself give the book a 5-star rating, sorry.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Fun for my Kindergartener &amp; preschooler. Cute graphics and sound effects... don't get annoying. Some levels are little more challenging, but I liked that there wasn't a &quot;scoreboard&quot; when they made a mistake. Fun free app!
B003LZ5B7S|2.0|I LOVE Doctor Who! I was in the mood to watch it so I decided to use up my instant video credit on an episode--hoping that they would have english subtitles since it's available on DVD. Unfortunately it does not. Amazon, that needs to be changed. If the movies on DVD has subtitles, then your instant videos should too! -Dissatisfied (deaf) customer

1594744769|5.0|Have to disagree with some of the reviewers here that label this a book suited for teens...please be aware that there is plenty of violence and gore to keep it in the adult realm. A fascinating and intriguing premise. Definitely kept me glued to the pages for a few nights running. Beyond the story, the author woos with a hypnotic and powerful storytelling style. The creative deployment of the photos adds to the enjoyment. The prose is taut and moving. Really, a wonderful and engrossing tale that spins its way through your mind even when you're not actually reading. A journey well worth taking...enjoy!
1849514003|5.0|An awesome book required in the bookshelf of any respectable cocos2d coder or  working with cocos2d.  Previously I bought the books from raywenderlich and itterheim and they are good and teach you the way cocos2d works, this book is the perfect cookbook to use and refer to after you learnt some basics.  If you don't know any basics this will be a bit hard to understand, but you can find some awesome tricks and code to use that will save your hours while coding.  Required on every cocos2d coders bookshelf for sure.
0811875040|4.0|This is a beautiful book!  Mine came with a notecard in it to correct a few known errors in directions.  There are still some noticable errors, but nothing major that hasn't been easy to get around yet.  So far I have made the Tomboy Cake (on the cover) with a strawberry buttercream, and the Lemon Cake made with the Hot Milk Cake, and both were amazingly delicious!  The errors are a little annoying (read ahead to make sure everything makes sense before starting!) but the results were amazing and I highly recommend the book.  The Vanilla Buttercream Frosting is by far the most delicious frosting I have ever had!
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I Plugged it in, it worked, and it's stupid fast.  I love it!  Using stock cooler in a mATX case (Lian Li 351B) and temps seem great.
B0069UP2PI|1.0|Seen this movie this past year and it is without question the worst movie of 2011.  You don't care at all about any of the characters, the plot moves very slow and the ending is incredibly stupid and laughable.  There is no reason at all for you to watch this film.  Watch \\"Outbreak\\" instead.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I started playing and I got in trouble with my wife for staying on her Kindle Fire too long! This is really a good way to kill some time!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|it was fun but some of the things you had to use the hints. oh and its pretty fun if you ask me.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|it is a child's game, which makes it easy, but there are some a bit difficult. you go through it fast so once you finish it your done. that's it. even kids will get bored once they finish it. you cant really play it again because you know all the answers. its a one play game, that's all. it needs more levels, or a more challenging next. different sections for different ages.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome.had it for a short time but its fun and challenging.best app I have on my tablet.best game is dirty gold
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game that I ever played in the world for any device. it has a veriety to chose from. all kind of games
B005NS0VNU|4.0|I don't own any other CD's by REM but I bought this on a whim after hearing that the group was parting ways.  It was a great price for all of the music and it gave me a good variety of songs that I am familiar with, while exposing me to a wide variety of their stuff.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|This is copy and pased from a online newspaper site I send movie reveiws to:  A group of Norwegian scientists find a frozen space ship along with an alien that supposedly died 100,000 years ago. The scientists hire a paleontologist to help deliver the frozen alien safely back to the Norwegian base and conduct experiments on the corpse to understand what it is. This is their chance to boast to the world that they have made a huge discovery. What they don't know, is they are in for a deadly night, with help from thousands of miles away.  I entered the theater with a positive attitude, despite having a history of hating sequels and remakes. I actually had high hopes for this film. The commercial seemed to promise the audience that despite being a prequel to the John Carpeter movie, it was going back to the basics of horror movies, and was not going to fool us with over blown special effects and bad acting. However, after the end credits, my friends and I agreed that it was only an ok film.  My first problem with the movie is the title itself. Why on earth is the movie called The Thing when the John Carpenter remake shares the same title? I noticed many viewers were confused by the title, and that this movie's plot would differ from the eighties' version. Unless a person had done some research online before seeing this movie, they wouldn't get that this is a prequel. I personally would have called it, \\"The Thing: The Norwegian Base.\\" It may not be the best title for the movie, but at least people would know it's not a remake.  My second biggest complaint is the Thing itself. In the eighties' version, the Thing is never truly seen in full form until the end of the movie. That version followed the standard set by Jaws, where the Thing is barely seen and slowly consumes its victims one by one, giving time for the viewer to wonder who the bad guy is and how the heroes are going to save themselves. In this prequel however, right off the bat, you see the Thing in its full form and its other versions as well. I dreaded the Thing, because every time it was on screen, it made the loudest screams. I wished I had a mute button. And of course, the alien is full CGI, which is not surprising, but I was hoping that they would stick to the original puppetry like the eighties' movie did.  My third and final complaint is the continuity errors in the film. You wouldn't notice them unless you watched the John Carpenter movie. But the errors are so bad they stick out like a sore thumb, if you have watched the other one. The biggest error is how they delivered the ending that is supposed to connect to the beginning of the 1980's movie. I felt the director screwed up, and at the last second0 shot the credits scene as a way to make sure the movie somehow tied to the predecessor.  On a good note however, I will admit I liked the characters in this movie because they were much smarter than most characters portrayed in slasher films today. The characters knew they were in a dangerous situation, and despite being under constant attack, they tried their best to keep calm and use their heads instead of doing dumb things that would make the situation worse. Also, despite borrowing moments from the eighties' movie, they did something new and interesting that actually was quite clever.  The movie may have its flaws and weaknesses, but I commend it for trying to go back to its roots and not follow horror-film standards of extreme gore and overused sex scenes. It's a good movie, but it would have benefited if the director or crew from the eighties' movie supervised the filming.  Star rating: 2 and half stars/5stars  Own it or diss it? Give it a try, but treat this movie as a real \\"Thing\\" and be careful.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's fun but not very responsive or easy to control. lots of ads. wish u could earn games faster. fish game wouldn't respond:(
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Friends With Benefits is a sexy and eventually sweet romantic comedy. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis are hot together and both of them have a nude scene, even if it is just their butts shown. There are many funny moments, and a few serious ones. Not a great movie, as it could have been cut by about 10 minutes. Still, worth watching if you want a new mainstream romantic comedy.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I have young kids and am glad to see a variety of free apps available.  This is a game enjoyed by my 2 year old when we are hanging out and killing time waiting at the doctor or watching another child at a sport event.  The colors and identification aspects of the game are appropriate for her now and in a few months maybe she will start to understand what is different so she can enjoy the game more.  It is too easy for my older two kids, age 9 and 6.  I am a professional and like &quot;smarter&quot; apps, but I also like that my family can play, too.  Thank you Amazon and for everyone complaining - please keep in mind that other kindle users have needs or likes different than yours.
0810994739|3.0|The book I have read is called Diary of a Wimpy Kid Rodrick Rules. I honestly didn't like this book very well, because I have read it before.  It is an elementary grade level book. I really wouldn't recomment this book for Middle or High schoolers.  I also think that the book is put together pretty well.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I bought this set for my 7 year old nephew for Christmas. He saw it in a Lego catalog and asked Santa to bring it. I knew going in that he wouldn't be able to build it by himself and he asked if Santa cold bring it already put together. I spent about 24 hours putting this together over the course of 4 days. The packaging is well thought out in that there are 4 boxes inside the large main box. I found that this made it easier to break up the process into 4 cycles. All in all the boy loved it so it was well worth it.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|seems like a good game for kids... the graphics are stimulating, cute, and fun to watch. as others have mentioned, some of the combinations make no sense. to be a sufficient learning device for kids, it really should give an explaination as to why they match or don't match.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I realy. liked it I still haven't beat it teat it realy is a great game but I think that some of the missions are dealt hard
B0054JZC6E|4.0|game is fun and I enjoy it.  passes time when you are not reading.  I like playing games and it offers a nice variety to choose from
B006C1DH92|4.0|it was realy cool and fun but I do think it could use a few more modes I think they shoud put more blades and maps on it
B00164GDA0|5.0|What can yo u say about the 4 grown little men that strive to find the body of a fallen youngster in the hard streets on the outskirts of the city. Not a movie you wan tot watch with your kids but a movie to keep your mind set young and remembering the old days and how things used to be. 5 of 5 stars but 9 out of 10. I big hit and always CLASSIC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. It is easy to use, has great reading plans and devotions. Would recommend to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a great time waster. I wish there were better descriptions. for the games before you spend points on them.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Amazing functionality while remaining very user friendly. The touch system isn't as intuitive as I'd like, but it still works well.   Definitely a must have app.
B006GG1KOC|2.0|This is a nice looking app but it fails in one of the main categories: it doesn't say what makes them different.  That's the entire point of this app and it doesn't even do that.  It definitely needs to be updated with that ability on the main screen during the game.  It doesn't even need to be all that complicated; just like one or two words, red, or in the bathroom.  The graphics are good though.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I regret for not purchasing this G13 when I was in my prime years of gaming.  If I can turn back time, I will get this hands down !  I would have been playing 25% better than being a damn clicker !  I would have been winning many more 19 and 29 Battleground twink games in Warsong Gulch, Arathi Basin.. and so on.. ( sorry, just releasing my tension )  Anyways, this G13 is a device that allows you the freedom to express yourself in the gaming world.  Your thumb can be your movement like the wind. And your fingers, are the judge ! The punishers, the act of expression !   As a gamer, I have been a good clicker, but no where near as good as I can be as a keybinder.  However with this G13, you are above a keyboard keybinder.   I have small hands, so I have to spread my fingers out wide to have easy access to the other buttons on the far right and left. It hurts for a few days, but the pain pays off.  My hand is used to it after 2 weeks. Its been about a month now, and I wish I had used this device many years ago.  Now Im playing Star Wars the Old Republic, and even though Im still learning how to play my class properly, the moves I want to execute is much faster in reaction time, and my eyes are on the players, the field and the action, while my mouse acts as a camera.  Just awesomeness !  However I am still getting used to muscle memory. That is knowing precisely which button I have programmed it to be.
B0000844M8|5.0|I greatly enjoyed watching this movie.  The quality is surprising despite how old the film is.  This will always be a great classic lion movie!  During the scene with the elephants, you can hear a clip that I'm positive was later used for the Tie Fighter sound in Star Wars.  Packaging  *****  ;3  Quality  ****  :3  (It's in color!  And I'm sure it's pretty good for how old the movie is.)  Acting  ****  :3  Presentation  ***** ;3  Overall *****  ;3
B000SCHBGQ|3.0|I had been looking forward to reading The Alchemyst for several years, so when it finally became available for the Kindle through my local library, I was ecstatic.  Sadly, the book did not live up to the hype the wait had created.  Admittedly, the book was a fun romp, but it lacked depth and development, especially of the characters.  Praises:  - Imaginative premise - Two twins are pulled into the adventure of a lifetime when a powerful book is stolen from the immortal Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel.  While running from the malevolent John Dee, the twins meet legendary figures, goddesses, and a host of friendly and not-so-friendly creatures.  The involvement of the twins in this adventure may not be by chance as they learn more about the Codex and what role they may play in the prophecies it contains.  Their journey takes them through Californa, into the Shadowrealm of Hekate, and back out into a small Californian town, which heralds an uncomfortable surprise.  - Incorporation of mythology - Other reviewers have listed this as a negative quality, but I enjoyed reading about a multitude of mythological creatures and beings.  The book provided a solid explanation for their existence that tied together mythology from various cultures, including Greek, Celtic, Roman, French, English, and Egyptian.  Their inclusion in the novel was necessary as a basis for the author's explanation of their origin as an Elder race that once populated the Earth.  - Magic - The depiction of auras and how they can be channeled to produce effects was a unique explanation of magic unlike any I had previously read.  The descriptions of these effects were vivid and detailed, and really gave the magic a life of its own.  - Action - The twins are thrust from one adventure to another, without much of a rest in between.  This must be a little tiresome for them, but it certainly keeps the reader entertained.  The fight scenes were all unique and variable.  The magic used within each action sequence was well detailed and completely different from scene to scene.  For example, in one sequence, the protagonists are bombarded by a multitude of violent birds, whereas in another, a horde of undead rise to reap death upon them.  Critiques  - Flat characters - This was my biggest issue with the book. The majority of the characters were one dimensional and lacked development.  The most extreme case was the male twin, Josh.  Although he is fifteen, he displayed the emotional maturity of a nine year old.  The majority of the time he was feeling one emotion, which was akin to constant irritation.  His general thoughts were always either A. mistrust of one of the various characters, B. Unhappiness at being treated like a kid, or C. concern for his sister.  His concern should have been touching, but since it was always misguided and paired with either A or B, any empathy I felt for him quickly vanished.  The other characters fared slightly better, but we never truly got to know or understand any of them.  We were told occasional surface thoughts or feelings, which never displayed any depth.  Scathach was introduced with a unique and quirky personality, but it quickly vanished and she began to act exactly the same way as many of the other characters.  John Dee, the villain, did not even get his own personality - many times he seemed like an older Josh, even complaining about the dark Elders treating him like a child.  I was hoping for some character development over the course of the book, but sadly it never happened.  - Repetition - Certain facts are stated over and over, which may be helpful for someone with short term memory loss, but was just tiresome after a while.    Overall, I really liked the book's plot and mythological elements, but that was not enough to make up for the lack of character depth.  Having sympathetic characters and likeable protagonists is key to a fantastic novel.  Sadly, this book had neither.  As amazing as the magic was, I didn't care about the fate of the characters (I even wanted to see something bad happen to Josh, to punish him for his terrible attitude).  I would recommend this book for anyone who likes magical battles and doesn't mind shallow characters.  Otherwise, save this one for later and pick up a book with a little more substance.
B0068RGVMK|3.0|have to start by saying i'm not hating on the LP, just not exactly what I was expecting.  Looking back at the progression from Once to Dark Passion Play to this, coupled with writing for the movie, I definitely get a feel and sense for what Toumas was trying to accomplish.  However, for me, it doesn't fully click.  i've always loved the symphonic, rock and opera feel of their music, it was vast, expansive and moving.  this time around, i feel the opera feel has been replace with more of a showtune type quality, which I'm not crazy about.  Totally understandable considering they were writing to accompany a film, i get that, i respect that, just not totally resonating with me.  also, i have a feeling that Anette has gotten more comfortable in her spot and the reigns were taken off a bit, which is great, however, it adds to the showtune quality, and definitely takes away from the past \\"operatic\\" (if that's a word) feel which Tarja's voice and training fit in perfectly.  There's a couple good tunes on here which will definitely stay on my MP3 player, but unfortunately I can already tell a lot of the tracks won't have longevity.  absolutely give it a couple of listens, definitely an epic work on Toumas' part and have to give him credit.........but don't expect the defining album of their library.
B0063GORYU|4.0|it has a easy to use and fun to play. has great graphics, and easy to read. can pay it vertical or horizontal. its also free!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Product works great. Easy to use. I have dell streak, and it works fast and stable. Has saved me time and gas, now I can help the parents and friends from my phone wherever I am.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is really addictive. I like it a lot. It is one of my most favorite apps.This game is great.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|One of my favorite games ever.  Sure wish this was around when I was growing up but happy to have it in my life now. I plan on playing this and carcassonne with my children when I have them.<br /><br />The base game is easy to learn and teach, making it excellent for game nights with newcomers or long time players.<br /><br />The expansions all add depth and fun and are easy to add/remove for each play-through.<br /><br />The game promotes thought, strategy, and compromise with just enough luck to keep it ineresting. You have to wonder if some of the world's leaders should play this before getting into their respective positions?<br /><br />I wish they would release a computer version of the game to play with people around the world, but then again sometimes it's nice to just sit down and play with cardboard, wood, and cards rather than digital screens, keyboards and controllers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great games. This App gives awesome games and you only have to play to unlock more and you can choose which
B003TJ4YUQ|2.0|the product arrived,  as always promptly and in good shape, I was just a bit disapointed with the contents of the DVD, I was expecting a better range of songs, no ones fault as the titles were not listed at purchase, if they had been I would not have bothered with the order
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers who say this product provides the desired protection without adding much bulk. Two thumbs up.  As to the stand feature. It's a bit flimsy. It takes a couple attempts to get it to work. I can't imagine it'll hold up to extended use as a stand. Luckily, that isn't a feature we use often or care about.
0307941515|1.0|This plot and these characters are made for a sitcom - or a stupid Alan sandler movie.  I've known real life ambulance chasers and \\"big law\\" attorneys, and they are much more complicated and interesting than this bunch.  All this book needs is a laugh track: insults your intelligence.
157492589X|2.0|This is a great story and showy 'videography' but this tape leaves a lot to be desired. My VHS struggled to maintain picture quality and I suspect this was remastered overseas to fit a single tape from  standard factory tapes. Appeared new but didn't play that way.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have never used a more smooth and responsive remote desktop application.  I would recommend this to anyone who has ever needed remote access to their computer.
B000A7DVR2|2.0|I can't for the life of me understand the almost 5 star rating for this DVD. I got about 20 minutes into this mess and stopped the movie. I like all the actors in it too. I guess it will make a good coaster. Sorry Coen Brothers.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|its gone after the update.I'm sadbecause I was on here for 2 hrs yesterday. Havana jk. I didn't diwnlaod jt
B0054JZC6E|1.0|kinda hard to get new games. Some of the games are almost impossible to do. Yet I still find myself slightly addicted to it. Hummm....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun. I play it all the time! I think that every one should have this game. this game is for all ages. so bye it now!
B005F96URI|4.0|Don't know where it came from. Don't remember a theatrical release. But this is so far out of left field I wonder how the cast was assembled and how it ever got the green light.  \\"Bunraku\\" is a real wild ride. Take a little \\"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\", throw in a bit of \\"Caligari\\" and a sprinkling of \\"Sin City\\" and you're close to the look and feel of this.  Here's the scoop. It's post apocalypse. The society is rebuilt but there are no guns. All fighting is done with hand held weapons. The \\"haves\\" still have and the \\"have nots\\" still have not. It's a skewed society. Ron Perlman is Killer #1 and he has 9 other acolytes behind him. He rules this particular city. Yoshi arrives in town to retrieve a medallion take from his father after he died at the hands of a bad guy. Josh Hartnett wants to release the town from Perlman's iron grip. Turns out both men are after the same guy.  This is a very stylish movie. None of the sets is something you'd find in a \\"normal\\" movie. There are very few right angles and no natural lighting. Everything is very German Expressionistic. Wild color schemes and weird set designs prevail. Even the script and acting are very stylized. The music is pretty wild as is the action. It almost looks like a live graphic novel.   This is not a great movie but I have to applaud it for its sheer audacity. There are some problems here. The script is nowhere near involved enough for the 2 hour plus running time. There are also too many fight scenes. They are generally well choreographed but, after the 5th or 6th fight, it all gets a bit tired. The acting is decent. Hartnett, Perlman and Woody Harrelson all do decent jobs. Gackt, as Yoshi is good. He has a great face for the camera and wears a sense of weariness about him. Demi Moore is also good in a role that is woefully small. That being said, this should still be seen. Movies like this don't come around often so, even with its shortcomings, it deserves the viewership to insure movies like this continue toget made. If you want a wild ride, this should do you just fine.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I havr an android tablet and this app works perfectly! It has a ton of study options!  Something for everyone!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I loved this book.  I have told several of my friends to read it if they want to read an amazing love story! Lots of very tense momments and the romance is so fun.  Many times through this book I couldn't put it down do to the butterflies in my stomach.
0553582038|5.0|I read the books without looking at any reviews at all about this book. Now that I did, I really think the book should deserve five stars. For those that were disappointed in this book may be because you guys had waited a long time for it. I recently just finish this book without having to wait at all and I'm going to read A Dance with Dragons next. I am a happy fan and reader. I'm a really big fan of fantasy and had read countless story with knights, dragon, lords, and magic. I never get tired of it, mainly because the author made each and every novel series a unique piece of work. Some story may start off slow but my patience have always paid off.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Enjoy the games.  Some are difficult to play on Kindle fire. Really enjoy playing games over to win points to buy new games.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This version of the original movies are the best looking so far, due mostly to being on blu-ray. There are so many special and extra features that there are three bonus discs. These bonus discs gives you a peek into the world that is star wars and how all the movies were made. This package should be owned by any true fan of the series. The amount of flaws seen by true fan boys should not over shadow the complete saga.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|my rate is 5  and this game is awesome and that it is to hard to play plus the points are to hard to get
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Bought the Grey/Cold Blue and it fits the Kindle Touch perfectly.  Nice and snug.  It doesn't add bulk and fits perfectly in my EULA messenger bag.  I wish there was other colors though. The color choices right now are kind of weird and bland.  Plus the red lining doesn't really seem to go.  Its very functional though so it gets 5 stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think a lot of people would like it because the games are so much fun and you can get a ton of games
0762439009|4.0|What an awesome price! Owning this kit lets my friends and coworkers know that I'm a huge Lebowski / Coen Bros. fanatic.  Only a couple problems:  1) The \\"Urban Achiever\\" certificate is folded in half twice.  2) The mouse pad was rolled-up the wrong way, so it curls upward when I lay it on the table. This can probably be resolved by rolling it up the other way and leaving it for a while before using it. Based on other user reviews, I'm sure the mousepad will be great.  Even the booklet, mug, patch, and toe are totally worth it. Again, no regrets at the current price of < $12.  ...and the Amazon description incorrectly describes the toe as a \\"big toe.\\" I was initially concerned, because it's clearly a little toe in the movie. I was pleased to find that it's a little toe, as it should be.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is awesome because you get free games that you normally have to pay for. Everybody should get it.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|Needs to be longer with answers, descriptions, and stats. Grades would also be good and more puzzles and fun! Yay!
1451627297|5.0|It has to say something about how much this book impacted me when, as I sit here today over 4 years from reading it, my heart still smarts from the last 50 pages. For the last 30 minutes of thinking of what to write about what I consider King's best novel, I find that all I can do is relive the pangs of a love between two fictional characters.<br /><br />You've likely read the descriptions of this as a suspenseful, contemporary science-fiction novel about the protagonist's travel through a time portal to 1958 to try to save U.S. President John F. Kennedy from being assassinated in Dallas, TX on 11/22/63.<br /><br />That's all well and good, I guess. Me, I'd describe this as a heart-chafingly beautiful love story, a soul-stirring homage to the connection between a man and a woman through time and space, a novel superbly-drawn and researched, full of suspense, with elements of both historical fiction (set primarily in Texas in the early 1960s) and science fiction, each of which is necessary to beguile you and then thoroughly break your heart.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|this will keep a small child occupied and help them with their problem solving skills.  Would like to see more sets added to prolong game play.
0061714372|5.0|I loved every page of this book!  A great read for anyone who wants an autobiography about a great man and a legend in heavy metal music. He writes about his highs and absolute lows of his crazy life. I found myself laughing at a lot of his stories, and surprise when he goes into depth about the life of a rock star. A must read for any megadeth or metal music fan.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This is a great read because even though it is fiction you find yourself learning lots about mythology. Like the whole series!
B000KIPT30|5.0|For a podcasting setup, instead of opting for just an audio (headphone) splitter, I bought this instead. Audio splitters obviously split the signal coming through and will make the audio sound quiet and if the adapter is low quality, probably distorted. This amp doesn't have that problem. It boosts audio levels individually as some of the in-studio guests have different hearing requirements and the range is wide. It's easy to plug in, small enough to be out of the way, built to last with a metal enclosure and definitely worth it when compared to audio splitters.<br /><br />With all of that said, I have noticed two small problems. The power-cord is on the same side as the audio ports, which forces the unit (with the audio ports) facing the wall or wherever the power-cord is coming from naturally. That's not a big deal but it forces that cord (or the audio cords) to partially loop around. The slightly more annoying problem is that this amp lacks a discrete on/off switch. I have panicked when I heard nothing through the headphones despite registering on the mixer only to realize the amp was not on because I did not plug in back in. There is a power light on the device, but since it does not have a switch, I do not always to remember to turn it on. Neither of these problems are in anyway major; the amp is great and is really better than a splitter.
B005OK725M|1.0|This was the most disappointing product I received this holiday season. I was hoping to download this to my iPAD to watch in the car while traveling. Sorry Folks, can't do that - even after registering on 3 different sites - a scam in and of itself since you cannot opt out and continue the registration process to redeem the code. This is nowhere near as user friendly as just loading the disc and having it copy to iTunes after redeeming the code. I will no longer purchase any DVD's or BluRay discs that have this as the \\"digital copy\\". And the movie studios wonder why their sales are declining. Seriously, it will take you less time to RIP a movie from disc.
B00650SSWG|2.0|My friend was urging me to watch this movie mainly because it's meant to be funny, sexy and oh well having Mila Kunis in the female leading role should be a more than enough reason to watch this movie anyway.<br /><br />The movie kicked off really good and interesting until Justin Timberlake's Character and Mila Kunis's Character became friends with benefits then it became another cliche Rom/Com. Honestly!<br /><br />It's almost like Hollywood has ran out of ideas when it comes to making Romantic Comedies or Chick Flicks. It's always the same exact formula. Boy meets Girl, Boy hates/dislikes Girl, Girl hates/dislikes Boy, Boy + Girl get to spend some unwanted quality time together. Boy + Girl hook up/date whatever. Boy + Girl fight/quarrel. Boy + Girl end the relationship and then in the last 10 minutes of the movie one or the other realizes they just can't do without that person, runs back to them, declare their undying love, apologizes for being a total jerk etc.... The other forgives them and then....Booom They live happily ever after. The End !<br /><br />How many times, do we need to see the same story but with different actors/leading roles ? If Hollywood can't come up with an original plot to make Romantic Comedies then it's quite simple stop making and recycling the same story line over and over again ! It just gets quite tedious.<br /><br />I'm so glad I rented this film instead of wasting money watching it at the theatre. I give it two stars for the first 15 minutes of it and for Mila Kunis cause she's sexy other than that...Skip this movie entirely unless you like recycled Romantic Comedies.

6302642248|5.0|In PINOCCHIO, Walt Disney's first feature-length cartoon since his historic [[ASIN:B00003CXCQ SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS]] (1937), the artwork amazes, one of its wonderful songs, \\"When You Wish Upon a Star,\\" won an Oscar, and the story of a marionette come to life who must resist temptations (with the help of a cricket conscience) if he's to become a real boy, positively charms. Artistic highlights are the brief wagon on a rainy night scene and the longer \\"Gepetto in the whale\\" sequence.<br /><br />Pinocchio is voiced by Dïckie Jones, a skilled horseman from age 4 who later appeared in many western films and TV shows. Cliff Edwards, the voice of Jiminy Cricket here, was a popular 1920s recording artist known as 'Ukulele Ike.' Edwards is credited with inventing a style of jazz singing called 'scat.' Cliff referred to it as 'effing.'<br /><br />The original Popeye, gravel-voiced William Costello, is probably heard as a statue, although IMDb assumes it's his FLEISCHER replacement, Jack Mercer. In his only Disney picture (not counting \\"Roger Rabbit\\"), Mel Blanc's sole contribution is a hiccup (all his dialogue was cut).<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.7) Pinocchio (1940) - uncredited voices of: Dïckie Jones/Cliff Edwards/Mel Blanc/Frankie Darro/Don Brodie/Walter Catlett/Marion Darlington/Evelyn Venable/William Costello
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I understand this game is meant for kids. I'm just not sure what age group would benefit most... or if the execution was done properly.<br /><br />My 2yo would definitely spend some time with this app. I just don't think he'll learn much from it. He's not ready. For example, when presented with a horse, a lion, a frog, and a whale, he would need to conclude that the frog is the correct choice. This is because that set is teaching \\"the frog is different because it is not a mammal\\"... not that the whale is different because it does not have any legs. With a ruler, button, computer mouse, and an elephant, the button is different because it was not grey... not that an elephant was different because it was big or because it was an animal.  I'm a very proud father but I just don't think he would be able to figure a lot of these out. Most sets have more than one possible answer even though only one will be accepted. The player would have to decide which characteristic is most likely in question. Some kids (and adults) would get frustrated.<br /><br />The skills required to answer the 125 questions range from 2 years old to probably 8... maybe 10? For my son, being on the younger end, this is mostly a bunch of buttons to spam with his trial and error approach. For the older group, they'll get a few challenging questions interspersed among those which would be way too easy.<br /><br />The game feels more like one of those online \\"Find your IQ score\\" tests that were so popular 10 years ago... but for 6-year-olds. As for its pedagogical value, it may be fine if you're able to sit down with your kid to defend the logic/reason behind each answer.<br /><br />The game would have received 4 stars if it took the time to explain the answers after each set. As it is, you're on a sprint to the finish line whether you've learned anything on the way or not.<br /><br />The game runs well on the kFire though the interface doesn't really fit the screen. The bottom is chopped off but that doesn't interfere with the gameplay.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are quick and silly but I find myself having to unlock the next game so I cant stop playing.

B000IOM1RI|3.0|Tenacious D is all about gratuitous swear words, especially in The Pick of Destiny. You don't listen to The D to hear about them sending the Devil's \\"butt back to Hades\\". I don't know why the clean version is the main version. Unless it says \\"explicit\\", it's going to be the version without swears or drug references and honestly, what is left at that point? If you can't handle swear words, there is literally no point to listening to this album.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Uber slick interface, precision controls, optimized code and FX for Tegra 3/quad core cpu's and polished gameplay raises this app to one of the top 5 mobile games available!<br />What we have here is a whole generation of shallow, spoiled kids who down-rate an app that's given to them gratis (that means free you uneducated brats) because it's not the latest FPS, running @60fps.  That's right, today it's an app geared towards parents, - who share this world and have paved the roads you walk on today.  Don't appreciate the free app of the day?  Go outside and ride your bike. Read a book. Meet a girl. Do something with your life!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I am not disappointed with this cover at all.  It is well made, sturdy and gentle to my Kindle on the inside.  It has a high quality look and feel.  My only suggesion would be a small tap that when folded backwards you could put the cover in an \\"A\\" shape and hold it for viewing the Kindle sideways.  I don't care for the covers that have a fold in the cover and this would work marvelously.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As a mom of 3 kids under 5, I don't have much time to work out so I LOVE that each work out is only 30 minutes (counting warm up/cool down) so I can do it during nap time and still have time for a quick shower before anyone wakes up. My oldest tries to work out with me so it gets him moving too.   I also think it's great that you don't do any one thing for very long. Just as your muscles start to get tired, you're moving on to something else.   Oh and one more thing - you don't even need fancy equipment to do this. Just a pair of weights (soup cans work in a pinch) and a mat. Very user friendly!
0142419400|5.0|Spoilers Alert**********  There is a modern introduction to Anna and The French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins. Anna the main character who lives in Atlanta, Georgia is being shipped off to boarding school in France against her will by her dad. Anna is smart, funny and nice but, she does not speak French. Anna meets Mer, a sweet curly redhead who introduces her to her friends, Rashmi (a girl), Étienne St. Clair and Josh. You soon discover Rashmi and Josh are dating and Mer has a huge crush on  Étienne and, Anna is starting to like him too in the more than \\"just friends\\" way. Some other characters of importance are, Ellie, Étienne's girlfriend, Bridge Anna's best friend and, Toph, the guy Anna was crushing before she left. And, the conflict or problem is that Anna is falling for Étienne and he already has a girlfriend and, his mom has been diagnosed with cancer and she knows even if he does like her in that way, he is not ready for a breakup on top of everything else (character vs. self).      Anna is doing bad in French, then Étienne's mom is diagnosed with cancer, Étienne and Josh come in to hr room along with Rashmi and Mer and the two boy are drunk and, Étienne whispers to Anna that he likes her as more than a friend while he is drunk. Étienne asks Anna if he said anything weird the day he was drunk, and Anna knows that right now, he just needs friendship so, she lies and says no. Anna and Étienne hang out during Thanksgiving because all there friends are visiting family, then Anna goes back home for Christmas and finds out that Toph and Bridge started dating and feels as though Bridge lied to her and cuts her off. Étienne and Ellie start fighting, Josh and Rashmi start fighting, Anna's birthday arrives and she, Mer, Rashmi, Étienne and Josh go partying and Anna gets drunk. Anna starts dating Dave, a guy in her history class but then she finds out he is rude and not well mannered, unhygienic, and breaks up with him. During the climax, Anna and Étienne start kissing and, Mer sees them and starts crying and, Étienne runs off after her later, Anna finds out that Étienne's dad is forcing him to go to college in France so he can watch him an so that he will not be close to his mom and . The next day, Anna hears that he went to Ellie's last night. The resolution, starting on page 360. Anna is climbing up the Eiffel tower and, Étienne runs up after her even though he is deathly afraid of heights. Her tells her he ran after Mer to comfort her and explain things that he went to Ellie's to break up with her and that, thanks to Anna's help his dad is letting him go to Berkeley in San Francisco where he wants to go and where he can be close to his mom and Anna. Josh and Rashmi break up but, stay friends and, Mer gets over her crush on Étienne, forgives Anna and, decides to go to college in Rome where she can learn Italian and hopefully meet someone.      At the end of this book, I felt assured, like like even with all the things that had happened, Anna and Étienne could really be together ad that Anna didn't have to hide her feelings. I would recommend this book to fans of Enthusiasm or, Justina Headley's North of Beautiful or, Nothing But The Truth (And a Few White Lies). This book is great for fans of the teenage romance where the main character must make some character vs. self decisions, \\"'I like your smile' I like yours too. But I didn't have the courage to say that out loud\\" (266 Perkins) and, \\"if he likes me, he's not in any state to begin a relationship or deal with the breakup of an old one\\"(153 Perkins) both say that Anna likes Étienne but, doesn't want to end his relationship with Ellie or their friendship by telling him.

This card does NOT work with their Thunderbolt adapter.<br /><br />Just spoke to customer support at Sonnet, and the gentleman told me that during the development of the Thunderbolt adapter, they HOPED it would be compatible, but it is not, and will not be for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I stupidly assumed that a company wouldn't market an adapter that couldn't be used with ONE OF ITS OWN PRODUCTS.<br /><br />DO NOT BUY this adapter for use in the Echo ExpressCard 34 Thunderbolt Adapter.

When I find great recipes online, I clip them to Evernote to save them. Then I have them on my Fire to use for cooking - much better than trying to use my laptop in the kitchen and a bigger screen than my phone. Of course there are many other ways to use this app, but this is one of my most-often used. For a free app, its awesome.

B006GG1KOC|4.0|It is a good educational game for children.  My 3 yr old is enjoying it.  An adult will need to play the game with the child in order for the child to get anything educational out of it otherwise they will just push buttons and not understand what they are doing.  My only criticism of the app is that it does not explain why the answer is correct ie.  \\"The fish is correct because it is the only one of the four found in the water\\".  It just makes a sound and the ladybug jumps up and down if the correct answer is picked.

1451648537|4.0|I was already somewhat familiar with the Steve Job's story before I purchased this book. However, the book goes into details of his life that I was unaware off. Technology gurus maybe a little disappointed in the time spent by Authors Walter Isaacson's describing Job's personal life, but it was Job's personal life and demeanor which helped to shape Apple's products.     His quest for perfection alienated a lot of people, including his family, but it played a key role in the excellence of Apple products. There was also a certain stubbornness that sometimes caused Jobs to miscalculate the market.  Job's claimed that he shaped the tastes of the market, and sometimes this lead to some failures like the cube.  However, Jobs had an intuition on what was needed in the market place. Even his life style was sometimes a contradiction. He followed an Eastern philosophy, but at the same time embraced Western ideals when it came to running Apple.  Isaacson describes Job's infamous temper and his nastiness toward those that he felt let down the company. You can admire Jobs the visionary, but also condemn the way he treated people, which was sometimes inexcusable. Jobs had no qualms about humiliating underlings in front of their peers. For this reason several people have claimed this book was a Jobs hit piece. That is far from the truth. The book is an honest expose of Steve Jobs. If the book was sugarcoated we would have no understanding on what motivated Jobs. From this book I get the impression that Jobs had to be control of any given situation. Apple was an extension of his ego, and anything that was not up to standard was deemed a treat. Jobs could also be extremely stubborn and this lead to some problems with Apple. Initially his stubbornness leads Apple to exclude licensing its operation system to other PC makers, and assure that Windows would become the dominant player in the industry. However, the author makes a good case for Job's closed architecture in that hardware andsoftware would work more cohesively. The PC industry is portrayed as being fragmented, where lots of different machines sharing the same software.  However, the PC model is certainly more successful in gaining market share. Interestingly enough this is the same scenario that is happening with Apple's war with Google and its Mobile phone.  The book further proves to me that Jobs was a visionary, but not a great inventor like Edison, Ford and Telsa. What Jobs did do was recognize an emerging market that nobody else saw and capitalized on it. With his fascination with fine art it also gave him a good sense of taste.  Jobs would frequently condemn his competitors for having no tastes.  One of Jobs main interest was combining the arts and the sciences, and this inevitably lead him to purchase Pixar. At Pixar he behaved and let the artist alone. Of all of Job's ventures Pixar was the happiest place to work and mostly immune to Jobs temper tantrums.  Even after regaining Apple after being thrown out, Jobs resorted to his old ways. However, this time Apple thrived and eventually created whole new market segments like the Iphone and Ipad.  In closing Walter Isaacson has created the most detailed account of Job's life. This is not a sugarcoated puff piece, but a brutally honest depiction on a flawed but brilliant man.
B00111YM5G|5.0|Gabriel was a great movie.  We purchased this movie as Andy Whitfield was one of the actors in the movie.  A great actor who passed away far to young.  I can't imagine what was going through Andy's mind while he filming this movie as he was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and his character is an Archangel. Very touching movie especially if you know about Andy's health condition while he was filming.  The sellers provided fast deliverly.  I would recommend the seller and purchase from them again.
1849514003|5.0|This is definitely the book to get that will help take you to the next level.  Skips all the basics (a good thing) and get's right to the good stuff.  I finished the book last night and have already added a lot to my developer toolbox.  I'm not sure if this would be a good \\"first book\\" for developers - maybe if you are an experienced developer and are just new to iOS development, but I can see some beginners struggling with some of the recipes.   I highly recommend this book and hope there is a \\"100 more recipes...\\" coming in the future.  Another good point is that the author has been very responsive when I've reached out to him.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I always thought that John Green was one of the most brilliant writers of all time...maybe not of all time, but pretty darned close.  The Fault in Our Stars only confirmed it.  As other reviewers, I laughed, I cried.  This is unlike any other book that I've read of John Green's.  I love his writing style because he adds an honest approach, but with humor and a little adventure.  They all feel a little off-kilter, but in a good way.  I was entirely engrossed in this book until I finished it because I absolutely had to know what happens at the end.  And yet, I still can't seem to get it that the story has ended.  I may have to read it again right away to feel like it's not over.  Which is exactly how I feel everytime I finish one of Mr. Green's books.  John Green, if you ever read your Amazonian reviews, that is a great compliment to you.  This is not an easy book to review simply because it is not a typical read.  All I can say is that it's just wow.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|\\"Hanna\\" is basically a strange blend of \\"The Golden Compass\\" (2007) and \\"The Passenger\\" (1975); with a little \\"THX 1138\\" (1971) thrown in for production design and atmospheric purposes.    Had \\"Hanna\\" (2011) been promoted for what it was, a relatively low-budget, live-action, PG-13 allegorical fairy tale; with a uniquely quirky performance by Saoirse Ronan, it would be better regarded by the movie going public. Rather than the minimalist promotion and distribution this type of film normally receives, for some reason the distributors decided that it had the potential to make big money.   So they threw almost as much money into marketing as had gone into production, sold the film as an action adventure suspenseful spy story, with another Chloe Moritz type hit girl.  They utilized a saturation booking technique normally reserved for their weaker blockbusters. This technique involves a lot of pre-release publicity and then opening it simultaneously in many theaters, with the goal of generating quick profits before bad reviews and word of mouth kill attendance.   The result was a lot of viewers who rightly felt that the film did not live up to its blockbuster billing, and a failure to appreciate the good points of the film. And there are some very good points. Ronan's earnest portrayal of the title character, a juvenile assassin and good daughter, rings true despite being unlike any character in cinema history.  Ronan manages to blend a bubbly enthusiasm for the newness of everything she missed growing up away from the world (think of a younger version of the Anne Francis \\"Alta\\" character in \\"Forbidden Planet\\") with the deadly but \\"fish-out-of-water\\" qualities of Arnold Schwarzenegger's \\"new-to-20th Century-earth\\" robot in \\"Terminator 2\\" (1991).  Ronan has effectively played the bubbly stuff before, most notably in \\"City Of Ember\\" (2008).  In \\"Hanna\\" she effortlessly slips back and forth between bubbly wonderment and analytic processing.  These contrasting personas are delivered so effectively (and in so many languages) that the overall performance ranks among the best in cinema history.    And credit director Joe Wright with the vision to stage sequences and POV shots that make Hanna small and vulnerable, enough so to evoke a feeling of protectiveness toward her from viewers.  Altman's \\"Kansas City\\" (1996) comes to mind, in which Jennifer Jason Leigh's tough talking gun moll created a powerful bond of identification with the viewing audience.   The film is a fairy tale and the good vs evil dynamic is more allegorical than precise.  Cate Blanchett plays a high level CIA operative who functions as the wicked witch.  Basically Snow White's evil queen step-mother masquerading as a cross between the Rosa Klebbs character in \\"From Russia With Love\\" (1963) and Nicole Kidman's character in \\"Golden Compass\\" (in fact Kidman's \\"Goldren Compass\\" character was also named Marisa).  She is assisted by the versatile Tom Hollander, a Wright regular (Mr. Collins from \\"Pride & Prejudice\\").  Blanchett's Marissa is evil and menacing without the redemption dimensionality of Kidman's \\"Golden Compass\\" Marisa.  Wright could have had much more fun with Hollander's character, but even so the minion is far more effective than his distaff master.  Wright is not trying to be plausible, if anything the story is more expressionism than realism.  This becomes especially obvious late in the film when the action switches to the huge abandoned Spreepark entertainment center in Berlin.  The park was closed in 1999 and the decaying fairy tale related rides and attractions are a production designer's dream.  These become a key motif of the film, much like the abandoned Salt Air Pavilion in \\"Carnival of Souls\\".  Also watch for the existential connection between Hanna and Laika, the Soviet dog-in-space;  torn from their world to be passengers through a world in which they do not belong.    Bottom line, I am going to recommend the film.  But with the advice to watch it for Ronan's performance and for its uniqueness; and to not try to place it into any neat classification.   Then again, what do I know\\", I'm only a child.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, and I think this adaptation is FANTASTIC.  The movies have been really clever interpretations of the books.  Granted, the books are always better, but the movies are wonderful.  Great casting, great acting.  I know some people who have complained of the slow scenes in part one of The Deathly Hallows, but those scenes are essential to the story and to the development of the characters.  I think those who have read and loved the books understand this.  Part two is a little more action packed, I suppose.  But as a whole the entire series is just awesome.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun and entertaining!! you will soon get addicted to the game. ads are not very bad at all... I would use a stylus to play though.
0439023521|5.0|I loved this book, it was exciting, suspenseful, kept you thinking, and I love the characters.  The author did an excellent job describing each character and everything was so detailed.  The second book was just as good and both of them I couldn't put down.  You just want to keep turning the page.  The last book was a little slow and streched but I absolutely loved the sotry
B003XE3G9M|5.0|This pair of shoes is very confortable. I found that the color Espresso matches with a lot of clothing because it is a dark brown. The style is casual so it can be worn with dress pants also.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game to stop and play. Works well and easy to control. I have this game on multiple devices and the whole family enjoys it.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I like what it does. Some things can't be seen such as windows media center but who cares.  It does what it says fairly we'll and easy to set up. Haven't seen any degraded performance inky PC from the softw!?are loaded on it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This app. is great tor beginners and seasoned Bible studiers. It very easy to navigate and with the multiple. translations its s very easy read. Needs to enhance the copy and paste feature. Also would be Awesome if it had more elaborate Bible study tools that can break down the scripture's to help with understanding.
0439023521|4.0|Ms. Collins's rural sci-fi tilogy, imagining a future not all that difficult to realize, provides a wonderfull venue for any reader to escape for about nine hundred pages. The Author's vibrant, tension filled violent world is found to be completely engrossing, exciting and quite inviting for enthusiastic, page-turning behavior. However, while Ms. Collins' tale of Katniss Everdeen's adventures do not dare challenge the reader, The Hunger Games is whole lot of fun.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.  It just goes to show that they certainly don't make movies like they used to!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Works perfect on the Kindle Fire. Fantastic reading plans and it includes most versions of the Bible all ad free. Highly recommended for anyone that considers themselves to be knowledgeable and wants to better understand history's most significant book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|App works great on Kindle Fire.  Can play music for alarm.  Snooze can be disabled.  Helpful math problems option makes you do a mind activity before being able to snooze/dismiss.    I have had good success with actually getting up after having to enter a math answer or code to be able to dismiss the alarm. It's a little flustering when I get 2*1 wrong, but it's worth the time I don't waste snoozing.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app, love it first thing in the morning when I'm getting ready for work. Because it loads so quick its faster than looking it up on line or watching the weather channel... and just as accurate.
0062119044|3.0|Oh my, what to say. What an amazing writer.  What a story to tell, and how well told (altho sometimes the author does go on too long).    BUT - why would anybody want to write a story like this?  Who would want to live in that world for as long as she must have had to, to write it?  Why does anyone voluntarily want to read a story like this?  It was recommended to me by a friend and once started, it was like a car accident, it was hard to look away, so I did finish it.  But I did not enjoy being in the world of that psychopath, Kevin.  It was ugly, it was mean, it was horrifying.  I wish I could forget I ever crossed paths with this book, but that will probably never happen.    I've never been SO repulsed by a story, however that in itself is a testament to the talent of the writer.  But I will never pick up another one of her books.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Pros: Very good interface. Game play is very smooth  Cons: Slight framing in graphics, which doesn't really matter unless I am nitpicking
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fun game, but it doesn't always work on the Galaxy Nexus. It often locks up and crashes. Please fix this as it seems to affect all PopCap games on the Galaxy Nexus.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is an ok bunch of games. I cant imagine how long you would actually have to play to &quot;unlock&quot; all of the games but its way too long
B002QE3CTY|5.0|An interesting idea for the future!I couldn't place the book down and unlike everyone else I came to really know and understand the characters!
B003G4W49C|3.0|not recommended for kids. theres a lot of language, violence and some inapropiate content. otherwise its a pretty good book, just wish it was cleaner.
0811879542|5.0|This book was a lot more fun for my kids than I expected it to be.  Both my 2 year old and 4 year old love doing what the book says \\"press gently on the yellow button\\" and seeing the \\"result\\" on the next page (my 2YO yells \\"Ahhh!\\").  It would probably be more appropriate for the toddler set learning about cause and effect, recognizing colors and patterns and following directions.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Vanishing Point has long been a favorite movie of my brother so when I was thinking of what to give him for Christmas this year, I didn't have think for too long. I bought this for him as a gift and he has enjoyed it tremendously.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Excellent app, but crashes every so often. Love the fact that they offer you different versions of the Bible as I love reading the NLT version. I also love that they offer you Bible reading plans that you can follow daily, and you can set a daily reminder. Glad that they also have highlighters and a note section!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|This game is pretty good for Children and helps them develop the difference between certain things and also provides decent pictures to help them learn.
B0063GORYU|4.0|does have some annoying pop out ads and a movie trailer will erupted randomly but hey, it's FREE and woos great on my kindle fire.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love my Tan Verso Prologue Case Cover I bought for my Kindle fire.  I has a real classy, feminine look.  The design makes it look like an actual book you are carrying or reading.  It is soft and light-weight too.  The inside has the feel of velvet and the Kindle fits snugly.  I think the price is good for the product.  I would recommend that every lady gets one for her Kindle fire.  The guys could get it in black.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|absolutely love it. my kids enjoy it as well.  it keeps us with new and different games. and the awards are very generous
B003L77FYS|5.0|I'm not a cop show lover by any stretch of the imagination.  Seeing the same rehashing of police drama plots over and over again isn't my idea of a great genre; I'd rather be watching sci-fi. So when I purchased the third season of Castle for my wife, I wasn't expecting to sit down and watch any of the episodes with her.  Wrongo.  This is a fantastic show.  I'm not that familiar with the first and second seasons, and beyond being acquanted with Nathan Fillion in his more ubiquitous role as Captain Malcom Reynolds, the other actors and actresses are new faces for me.  But the show is engaging, addicting, as it takes the standard cop show formula and turns it on its head.  Fillion as Castle is great, injecting a dose of humor at the right time here while contributing to the romantic tension between himself and Stana Katic, all the while solving crimes that occasionally provide unexpected twists (Sorry to say, however, that a few of the \\"twists\\" could be seen a mile away, but that's par for the course).  The supporting cast fills their roles well without overshadowing Castle and Beckett but also remaining visible and significant to the plots.  Most enjoyable, however, are Castle's occasional references to Firefly (Speaking Chinese out of the blue and then referencing \\"a great show\\" where Castle learned it?  Classic!).  Good to see that Fillion and the show's writers care enough to insert things like that.  It makes the show much better for those of us who remember Fillion in his scifi heyday.  Even if cops and robbers aren't our thing, the reminders of a different universe (or 'Verse to be precise) bring a smile to our faces.  Bottom line, for the cop show lovers, you won't be disappointed, and the rewatch factor according to my wife is quite high, so there's no danger in losing interest after one viewing.  Castle is a must for the armchair sleuths.  J. Dean, Author, [[ASIN:B001S2RBFG The Summoning of Clade Josso: The first descent into the Vein]] and [[ASIN:B00486UDGSThe Summoning of Old Velt: The Second Descent into the Vein (The World of the Vein)]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun and addictive set of games. some games are notably more fun than others and there seems to be some variety in the quality of individual games. the point system adds a capitalistically fun element.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Before I continue, let me be clear that I am not giving John Green three stars. He works hard at making the world a better place through his charity fundraising, vlogs, etc., and I admire and appreciate him. As a public figure being looked upon as a role model, he gets five stars.  I've been following his work for almost 5 years, and I hope that he'll continue to make content for years and years to come.  That's my review of John Green.  Now, on to the book review.  The Fault in Our Stars starts out extremely strong.  Hazel, the protagonist, is so wonderfully crafted that I am amazed that John Green was never actually a teen girl himself.  Those first descriptions of Issac, Gus, and the place/event where they meet are also perfectly written.  I felt like I was right there with them, seeing and feeling everything as Hazel did.  There are other moments later in the book that are absolutely perfect.  TFiOS definitely contains some of John's best writing ever.    However, as the story goes on, some problems stick out.  1) I know that this is a work of fiction, but there were moments when the plot grew so ridiculous that I found myself saying (out loud!), \\"you CAN'T be serious.\\"  Fans of John Green's previous books will find that TFiOS makes the wackier moments of \\"Will Grayson, Will Grayson\\" seem realistic by comparison.  If you had trouble suspending your disbelief enough to appreciate WGWG all the way to the end, you're probably not going to like TFiOS.  Minus 1.5 stars for screwing up a beautifully realistic story with unnecessary and totally unbelievable twists.  2) I have no objection to impressive vocabulary and deep conversations coming from the mouths of fictional teens (actually, these kids sound a lot like my friends did I when we were their age), but this is like the Gilmore Girls on Adderall. Every single conversation between the main characters is a rapid-fire exchange of existential questioning, brilliant wit, metaphor analysis, and \\"look how smart I am\\" vocabulary. Even brilliant people have relatively normal conversations once in a while.  Dialogue seems to always be one of John's weak points, but this time it's really more the fault of his editor.  It just needed to be dialed down a little.  Minus 0.5 stars for also screwing up the realism of the story with unnecessarily, incessantly wordy dialogue.  3) This is just very a minor criticism... but \\"Augustus\\"?  That's the best name that John could come up with for that character?  If he were a normal teenager named Augustus, it wouldn't have been so bad, but there are already SO MANY unlikely elements to accept about him that giving him a ridiculously unlikely name kept pulling me out of the story and reminding me that he is not and can not be real.    4) This is purely a personal opinion, and other people will totally disagree... but I didn't like the depressing message of the story. One of the main themes of TFiOS seems to be the ultimate futility of everything that we say and do, the ultimate meaninglessness of all of our values and relationships and beliefs. We live, we die, the world goes on. Individual lives are soon forgotten forever. In a dozen decades or so, nobody will remember anything about your life. The people who knew you will also die, and it will almost be like you never existed, and you can't bank on an afterlife.  That's VERY heavy stuff, especially in a book targeted at teens and young adults.  Not every story has to be happy, and not every story has to have a moral, but I wasn't expecting such a dark message in this one.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app when it comes to getting my weather. Not only is it always at my fingertips but it's remarkably accurate. With videos from local news stations and a 15 day forecast it's all you'll ever need!

B0055PMJMW|1.0|I've read most, if not all, of Michael Connelly's book..........however, I am really aggravated that recent publications are on Kindle or audio only.  I do NOT want Kindle or any part of the electronic 'books'.  I like a Paper book that I can hold in my hands, carry with me and read anywhere, even by candle light, if necessary.  I sincerely hope this isn't an indication of the future in literature.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|There is NOTHING original in this movie. There is EVERYTHING pretentious in this barrel of crap. This movie has been done, much better by other people, and should have foot notes. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP.   This film is slow, and passes for emotional, only for the fools who drink this idiotic Kool-Aid. It just trudges along, and is deadly dull. The creation section has been done much better elsewhere, and LOOKS TACKY... The handheld closeup shots get OLD, very quickly...   SAVE YOUR TIME AND MONEY... MALICK IS AN IDIOTIC IMBECILE!!!!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|to the one who complained that the app doesn't tell what the difference is......that is the perfect time for the parent, grandparent, babysitter, etc. to interact with the child. That might be what is wrong with our young people today.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I bought this cover for my first and only Kindle Fire and I think I am in love with it.<br />Everything the other positive reveiwers say is true: soft yet durable leather, beautiful color, lovely script, looks like a journal and keeps my baby Kindle safe and secure.<br />I have been extremely resistant to the whole concept of electronic books for some time as I love my bookshelf crammed with memories and great stories but once I got the Kindle Fire as a gift, this cover assuages my still guilty conscience. It looks and feels like a precious book.<br />I. LOVE. IT.<br />BUY IT.
B005MYEPXC|3.0|Enjoyed the movie in the theatre, so I could not wait to see it again on Blu-ray.  However, I was disappointed with the video and audio quality.  The picture quality was sharp but the majority of scenes were far too yellow and the audio was a disappointment.......only 3.0 and not 5.1 audio sound.  Not good enough for todays high Blu-ray standards.  My Video rating and Audio rating out of 5.......is 2.5

B0040UAYI4|5.0|I have been a PC gamer for over 12 years now and recently switched over to console gaming. I picked up a PS3 and a copy of MW3. I totally forgot why I stuck with PC fps games until i started playing mw3 on the ps3. I suck with the controller. no matter how much I played I just couldn't get used to the joysticks. I know for a lot of PC gamers, if not all, a joystick aiming system just does not feel natural. I thought i completely wasted my money and regretted not upgrading my graphics card instead. I came across the eagle eye and watched a bunch of videos and read a ton of reviews. I noticed that 95% of the reviews said it was not 100% PC feel but just slightly off. I picked up my copy at a local electronics store and set it up the first night. At first my settings were no where near PC type feel then I found a great setting on Penguin Uniteds forums. Let me tell you my K/D ratio immediately went up. The settings I use now are about 98% PC feel. I now see what everyone means when they say its not 100% Pc but it is pretty damn close. If you want to go 29-1 in TDM on MW3 get this product.

B002OB9KPE|3.0|I have a complaint with a lot of progressive rock: great music, complexity & sometimes beauty, but then mired by banal or \\"unprogressive\\" lyrics (e.g., Dream Theater). Sure, not every band can have a Pete (Sinfield or Gabriel) penning their lyrics, but sometimes it's better to just shut up and play...  I love all the music on the Transatlantic albums. They contain a lot of really beautiful melodies that i find running through my head days after listening. The guys are all great on their instruments. The compositions are usually better than \\"good enough\\" because of their beautiful melodies, though sometimes you can hear derivative bits of Yes, Gentle Giant, etc. That's ok. Those older bands are the reasons many of us got into progressive rock in the first place.  At times, however, i feel as if i'm being beat over the head with christo-mythic proselytizing. When Whirlwind reaches its climax, and all the musical themes are revisited (spectacular!), it feels like the lyrics are trying to re-create the power and mystique of the end of Genesis's Supper's Ready. But they fail. The lyrics just get too literal: \\"There is the key he has given you, search it out. All who seek will find the truth!\\" and \\"And he was sent to deliver. And bring forth the river of life\\" blah blah blah... Yes, i've read the reviews saying if you don't want to hear these lyrics, then don't buy the albums. But those who might be sensitive to mediocre lyricism should be aware before buying this album. If your band wants to wear the mantle of Progressive Rock, then should not your lyrics be Progressive too (or at least onomatopoetic/cryptic)? Perhaps there's a reason that Jon Anderson's voice is practically unintelligible. Some of Yes's lyrics are pretty silly - but can you tell?  I'll say again - i love the music on Whirwind. But it's getting harder and harder for me to repeat listenings. What a shame. Can i get an instrumental version?

B000PC6A3E|4.0|This is the second best super-hero movie of all time (#1 goes to Dark Knight) and it definitely is more interesting in the realistic take on a fantasy genre, which is plausibly in the real gritty world. I especially liked them addressing what is IMO a plausible critique of Bruce Wayne: that he by way of his pornographic wealth creates the crime that he fights.  And since this is a 2005 release, I won't spend anymore time on the story and themes.   I just want to comment on the video quality. It isn't very good! There is noticeable artifacting in many scenes. I viewed this on a PS3 on a 1080p plasma. I have viewed a number of blu-rays and they were encoded better. Heat for instance has probably an equal number of dark scenes to it and there was not as much artifacting. Of course a lot is a result of the movie itself, which has many dark scenes, which is how the codecs work and so forth, but is was a little disappointing.

0812992792|5.0|The title of this review is a rough quotation from the novel The Orphan Master's Son. And as it turns out, in the North Korea Adam Johnson presents, this is the sad truth.<br /><br />The novel follows a few years and some of the most traumatic experiences in a young man's life-- who is arguably nameless. At first, he goes by Jun Do, the orphan master's son; through this character we become acquainted with his mommy, daddy, family, and trust issues-- torments all brought upon him by the harsh realities of the State in which he lives. For example, he is haunted by the memories of the orphans he was forced to grow up with, and the memories of each of their terrible ends, (orphans are an abused and unwanted lot in Johnson's North Korea). To reveal the exact path on which readers are lead in following the orphan master's son's progress would be to spoil the magic and style of Johnson's storytelling.<br /><br />Which leads to one of the novel's-- or, rather, the author's-- strong points: its prose. Such lovely analogies and patterns of words existing in a novel of horrors is really something to take note of. And it really serves to accentuate the fact that it is in fact horrors that are being described. Another particularly crafty trait of Johnson's writing is the way in which he enumerates iniquities and offenses against his characters with nonchalance, slipping them in out of nowhere to take the reader totally off guard. It gives one a sort of sense of Johnson's North Koreans' overall capitulation to the injustices of their lives.<br /><br />I know this novel will be described as drama or as a thriller; it's true that the story has those elements. But I hope people recognize its literary value as well. Most notable, in my opinion, of meditations in this novel is the one on narration-- on storytelling as an act of creating reality; storytelling as an act of changing the truth; and storytelling to save oneself.<br /><br />North Korea is regarded by the United States as a sort `black hole' of intelligence; I suppose this is why I had no idea of what has gone on in this country for the past century or so. Adam Johnson's novel is not nonfiction-- but he has stated in his interviews that it is based heavily on research he conducted. Given the research I've been compelled to do on my own since finishing his novel, I tend to believe that much of it is not at all far from the truth. I had no opinion of North Korea before reading this; I finished reading it on the day Kim Jong Il's death was announced, and my feelings were overwhelming.pose this is why I had no idea of what has gone on in this country for the past century or so.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|I have a white Verizon iPhone 4... this case looks really sharp on a white iPhone, I love the swirl design on the back, the Amazon logo is hardly noticeable at the bottom, and it has a very snug fit. But I like to keep screen protectors on my phone and can't seem to get this cover on without forcing air bubbles into the screen protector. I was expecting this cover to feel more rubbery, and as such, I thought it would be more manageable/ flexible. But it's a little difficult to squeeze over the phone while keeping the edges of the screen protector down. I ended up using a different cover and this one is now in my closet. I'll definitely keep it because I like the way it looks and I would trust my phone in it (it feels very durable and would likely protect your phone if dropped). I'm hoping to get it on the phone, screen protector and all, soon :) Worth the price...

But I have to say that my absolute most favorite part of this book is that I could download the apps and try out every single one of the recipes. So don't wait any longer go and grab your copy today, you won't regret it.
0618001905|4.0|I believe that Adam Hochschild's book is well researched and well written. In it he discusses all of the major characters in what is an almost unbelievable episode at the end of the 19th century that led to a single man being in control of such a vast section of Africa. Leopold himself comes across as an envious and avaricious monarch desperate for Belgium to have a colony as the other European monarchies had. He emerges in the end as a small insecure and pathetic character. Others who are connected to the story of the Belgian Congo straddle both the evil and the noble sides of human nature. Henry Morton Stanley falls into the first group and several humanitarians who campaigned tirelessly to expose the terrible abuses in the Congo fall into the second. The story if how these various individuals impacted and influenced the lives of those who were suffering under a brutal and hidden forced labor system is the uplifting part of what overall is a very grim book. At times it reads like a catalogue of atrocities that were inflicted upon the poor souls who were unlucky enough to live in the Congo during this period. As a look into how past events have influenced the tough history of the 20th century in Central Africa, King Leopold's Ghost is must reading. However it is history that is as stomach turning as it is enlightening.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a wonderful game, or games, I guess. However, they have a way to get &quot;points&quot; for free, but if you have a Kindle Fire, that feature is useless. Why? Because it means getting apps from the Android store.
B0063IH60K|5.0|For me solitaire is meditation.  It requires strict attention but no real thinking.  If you like classic solitaire you will like this app.
1451627289|5.0|If you never enjoyed a King novel then this is one for you!!  If you enjoy King then this one is for you!! It is and it isnt King.  I find King hit and miss with his novels and this one is out of the ballpark.  I love the premise, and the attention to detail is incredible.  This is right up there with The Green Mile and Misery.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|As a fan of 30 Rock and SNL, buying this book was a no brainer. As far as I'm concerned, Fey single-handedly rescued SNL's Weekend Update from being a punchline. The fact that she anchored the desk while not being a regular performer on the show was even more impressive. By reading her book, you see that the odd spot in her career was the time she spent doing more writing than performing... The stories about her early years in comedy are worth the price of the book alone, but as a fellow writer, it's difficult not to be inspired by the path that Fey took.  Her success with both 30 Rock and Date Night prove that decades from now, Fey's time at SNL will be thought of as where she got her start, which is impressive, because so many other female comedians have to point to their time at SNL as the height of their careers.  If you like to chuckle and are looking for some other real world comedy/advice, then perhaps you'll enjoy The Three Dollar Scholar as well. It's $3.00. It's funny. You'll laugh, you'll learn... You'll do something else with the letter L...  [[ASIN:B005URS1GI The Three Dollar Scholar - Awesome Advice for Acing Life's Major Decisions and Mindless Debates]]
B000001FSR|1.0|My mother came across \\"Way Down In The Hole.\\"  She loved the song.  I bought the CD for her for Christmas.  That was the only good song.  The rest was so awful that we had to turn it off while we were opening the rest of our gifts.  We never did put it back in.

B004LWZW42|5.0|This was a good movie: better than most Marvel Superheroes. Michael Fassbinder stole the movie: McAvoy is good as Frances X. They actually explain why Captain Picard is disabled! Is Kevin Bacon in every movie? I would like a few MORE degrees of separation from his hammy acting.
0553386794|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Very well written. It's great to see that there are still fantasy writers on the level of Tolkien that don't write for children. (no offense JK)If you like fantasy read this book then watch the series on HBO it's also damn good.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great Bible app! so many versions on here! plus the ability to highlight, make notes, and some versions even have an audio recording! some versions cant be read offline though, so be sure to have an offline version selected in the app if your church doesn't have wifi
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This app is awesome! It was very easy to set up and has so much benefit. I like being able to access my home laptop when I am away.
0307959856|3.0|I really wanted to like this but found it over wordy and slow - things that don't make for a good crime novel which needs to engage the reader and have a good pace. Another British crime author you may enjoy is Lesley Cookman - first in the series is [[ASIN:1905170157 Murder in Steeple Martin (Libby Sarjeant Murder Mysteries)]].
B001HY3BFE|5.0|Another great Saxon album! I get tired of people comparing Saxon albums back to back change is good especially if you never leave the roots of metal. If every Saxon album sounded just like the last we would hear the same gripes from the same people, no improvement no change it all sounds alike....blah blah blah. For Christ sakes people this bands giving us headbanging metal since 1980 thats staying power and sure they have one album that is someones favorite while being someone elses let down at the same time. That doesnt make it the worst or the best its just a matter of opinions. Saxon can rock me anytime I can sit down and start with Saxon S/T and go all the way through to Call of Arms and love every minute of it. And even now with Biff up in his sixties and the rest of the band pushing age also they still blow other bands away!!  Just check out anything from Wacken on youtube yeah now you get it! Sorry but Im pretty passionate about SAXON !
B003M7BLOW|5.0|The socket it fits is readily available and common on most motherboards, so it is easy to find.  [...]  [...]  That gives a good idea of what processors are good performers.  As you can see, in terms of availability, and performance, this is second or third only to the 960t
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is fun but some of the games controls are a little off and you have to replay a whole bunch to get the points
1559408758|5.0|This DVD is almost impossible to get, and that is too bad.  The movie is just as good, but the ton of extras in this version are amazing.  First there I about another movie's worth of deleted scenes, some of which are not in any other version.  For instance, the section about the opening act is hilarious.  The commentary was actually serious, as the special edition has the guys back in character, which is just as funny.  But it was interesting o get the real scoop on how it was made, as this is an interesting process since there was a lot of ad libbing.  And, since it such an interesting movie that people will actually like, Criterion, of course, no longer has it available.  The biggest complaint I have with Criterion is that they seem to find the absolutely least commercially interesting movies and use them.  These tend to be movies that only film students will love, and yet they advertise that they are key movies in cinema history.  While they have every single Truffaut, Cassavetes and Kurosawa movie, they have nothing by Spielberg, one by Scorceses, and two by Kubrick.  All none of heir great films.  They have The Leopard, but not From Here To Eternity.  Last Temptation of Christ, but not Goodfellas.  Paths of Glory but not A Clockwork Orange.  The Lady Vanishes but not Psycho.  I've never understood it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The choices it gives you for bibles is amazing, from A-Z! I never write reviews, this is actually the first one I've ever written! I just want to say...download this app..it's free...if you don't think it is as amazing as I do then delete it....you have nothing to lose and everything to gain! God Bless!
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I haven't read the book yet, so this review is purely on the film. I enjoyed the film. It reminded me of many similar future dystopia novels, such as Brave New World, Handmaid Tales, etc.   Kiera Knightley performs brilliantly as always. The rest of the cast acts well too.   Can't think of anything I didn't like.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|wish they changed the point system, it takes too long to open most of the games. but it is fun to play while waiting for something else to do
B001E45XT4|3.0|The gamecom 367 is an okay headset to use if its going to be your first headset. The price was under $30 dollars when i bought it. I bought it because i was currently using the Gamecom 1 made by plantronics and i loved it. So i decided to go with another gamecom headset. This headset comes with a undestructable plastic cover that took me about 20 minutes to open to use my headset. It actually broke one of my scissors handles. The headset it self looked alright, the style was cool. But when i held it with my hands, it felt VERY flimsy. I was scared to put it on my head because i was so scared it would break. The headset fits on your head tight and the headset goes over your ears so you can only hear them. I think if you wear these headsets more than 3 hours it will probably be uncomfortable. But for 30 dollars plus 8 dollar shipping it aint bad. The sound quality is very good, but its too good. It is too clear, but it gives you surround sound. These headphones barely have bass unless you crank up the volume on max. I wouldnt recommend these headphones for music, ONLY gaming.  But all in all, i would rather spend $30 more dollars for a better headset than these. I really dont know why these headphones have very good ratings.
B00018D3RI|5.0|I bought all four seasons of Starsky and Hutch. Having just finished watching Season 1 (I probably haven't seen most of these episodes for 30+ years) I had forgotten how charismatic David Soul and Paul Michael Glaser were together.  Whether you think the series is dated or not, no one can deny it set a brand new trend in TV--the \\"bromance\\". Starsky and Hutch were very touchy feely for two cops and I think no one had ever seen this on TV before.  Yeah, some of the filming was cartoonish. After all, the 3rd star of the show was a red Ford Torino with a giant white stripe. (Glaser hated the car so much he purposely ran into everything he could to try and destroy it). I was amazed at how physical the actor's roles were--they did a lot of running and jumping and chasing bad guys. Studios probaly wouldn't even allow their stars to do this today because of insurance issues!  All in all, I really enjoyed Season 1 from beginning to end and am looking forward to watching S2,3 and 4. If you have a fondness for 70's TV, Starsky and Hutch S1 will bring a smile to your face. If it doesn't then you must be too young to appreciated the time and the place.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I received my sweeper, charged the battery and had a go with it- it is perfect for cleaning up cat hair and litter,crumbs dust bunnies ,hair even leaves that blew in through an open door ,I use it on tile, wood and concrete. This is not a vacuum replacement but it replaces my broom and dust pan ( my overpriced vacuum only works on carpet!).My broom left lots behind - this sweeper picks it all up! BUT the battery died after about 3min.  I did not want the hassle of sending it back for a replacement so I contacted the company ( ONTEL) and ask for a replacement battery- off course they wanted to see the receipt which I e-mailed and my new battery was on the way free of charge.  Cleaning the brushes is a bit easier than my standard vacuum- since the handy thread cutter is included and the clear cover over the brushes lifts off for easy access.  It is a little noisy but not as much as a handheld vac.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|it will not install this sucks!!! if anyone knows how to fix this plz step up and say what's wrong and how to fix it
B003297I1U|5.0|Really superb toy this one. Mine eventually came from a local store instead of Amazon due to mess my third party shipper caused, they wanted to charge 4 times what Amazon was going to charge to ship it to my country!! Overseas shoppers ALWAYS use Amazon to ship to your local address else risk facing the inconvenience i did.  Anyways we have the toy now. It's really brilliant...its the first in the Scania series for my boys, kids are all over it...the dorrs the number of knobs, functions, siren...its just mad.  This is helping my 4 year old improve his coordination which he has been bit slow with.  Its a good looking realistic toy. Functionality is superb, as with all other Bruders...you need to teach your kids how to use them to ensure they don't break some of the moving parts.  Toy is a source of joy for both my 4(turning  5 this year) and 6 year old son. we are hooked on Bruder toys!!
B003EV6DBW|2.0|Season 5 starts off with a bang with the new doctor and the first episode is amazingly fun. Then the writing does a three sixty turn and goes downhill fast. There are a couple of well written episodes along the way, but nothing consistent.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has helped me come further in my relationship with Christ and i intend to keep using it daily!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|The game can be challenging and I had several wrong answers in my time with it. The point of the game is to think. If one could just fly through all the 125 levels without thinking about some of the answers then it would be a pointless app. This would be great to do with your kids since you would both have the opportunity to discuss each level.<br /><br />Amazon does not notify me when there are replys from Devs about comments and I have no option to set that from my phone. I got replys pretty quickly from them and they had fixed issues I had brought up in my initial review. I wish I had been notified so I could have updated my review..<br /><br />My initial complaint was that every bit of demographics data was being tracked. The Devs had seen this and had turned these off as they are all set to ON by default. I have rechecked the app and confirmed there is NOTHING whatsoever turned on besides the IMEI required from Amazon.<br /><br />I thank the Devs for their quick actions to fix this issue. I felt like a dick when I saw those.<br />I wish I had known more than a year earlier when it was corrected.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|and easy to get addicted to. the second i picked it up i couldn't put it down.  the point system is pretty cool too.     -sent from the batcave
B0002KZAKS|4.0|We needed another set of mics for another location so we didn't have to pack up our stage set every time.  This mic seems to work as well as the Shure 58s we currently use and the cost was exceptional!  Time will tell but I expect just the permanent set-up will give us a long life over packing and unpacking.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the app works well and is true to what it says in the cover. over very little frustration so far! :)
B006OOHYIC|5.0|My first review as this merits such.  This and the original Quell are the two best mobile games ever.  Period.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Games are cute and fun.  They keep you wanting more. The points keep you trying so that you can unlock more games.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel! I've always found the JFK assassination fascinating, despite it being many years before I was born. I have visited the 6th Floor Museum in Dallas several times, and I have often pondered the same thing King has: \\"What would happen if JFK had finished his term(s) as President?\\" The main character, Jake Epping, is highly believable.  I found myself agreeing with his decisions and relating to him. Although finding a portal back to 1958 seems highly improbable, I found this story to be one of King's most realistic. The characters, all of them, are absolutely wonderful, and I felt as if I was in the story. As a child of the 80s, I was fascinated by King's descriptions of America in 1958. This is an incredibly well-written novel. It is impossible to put down. There were a couple of errors in the Kindle edition (less than most ebooks I've read), but they in no way distracted me from the plot or ruined the magic. Buy this book. Go back in time. Enjoy the ride.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I love this case.  I searched and searched on Amazon for a case for my kindle fire.  At first I was leaning towards a leather one, but many of the reviews said they were so heavy.  I wanted something lightweight with the stand feature.  This case/cover from Marware is perfect!  Lightweight, kindle fire fits perfectly, stand works well.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone getting the kindle fire.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As someone who has been in the writing business a long time, I'm constantly looking for new ideas to market my work. In today's publishing climate, publishers--traditional and indie--are throwing ideas against the wall to see what sticks. There is no magic formula. I repeat: There is no magic formula. Success is built on trial and error, and by looking at the successes and failures of those who have gone before. Young writers are taught (or should be, anyway) to model the work of exceptional writers, to feel how the writing happens, to try it on for size. Writers are now also required to be marketers. It's a ridiculous situation. Artists are not temperamentally suited to endure the vagaries of the business world, but that's the reality. We need marketing guidance.<br /><br />I've read both Konrath's Newbie's Guide and Stephen King. Now John Locke. All are crazy-smart and successful. Why wouldn't a writer who is about to plunge into the wild world of publishing--indie or traditional--want to be armed with good information and ideas? Locke's enthusiasm may sound over-the-top to some, but I find his approach humorous and encouraging. I, for one, am thrilled to have his ideas for cheap, and can't wait to give them a go.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging, relaxing, and refreshingly unique puzzle app for Android.  There are enough levels to challenge most anyone.  The first few get polished off pretty quickly, but by the time you make it 1/2 way through they become challenging for even skilled puzzle players.  I'll definitely be buying the sequel once I finish it.<br /><br />The app works perfectly on my Samsung Infuse running Froyo Android 2.2 so far.
0393064476|5.0|Humanists and others interested in the history of ideas, will find this a wonderful read.  It flows well, particularly as it follows the main character in the priestly courts of 15th century Europe, and the dastardly doings of the Pope and the clergy.<br /><br />The focus, however, is on the 'find' of the main character.....a full copy of Lucretius' On the Nature of Things....and a discussion of Lucretius uncanny insights into atoms, the nature of religion, rejection of the idea of afterlife or soul, etc.  And onward to the Italian Enlightenment.<br /><br />For those in need of a bit of Enlightenment in this country where presidential candidates claim they have a mandate from their god to rule, this book comes just in time.
B0045JEPXU|5.0|This cd makes me want to dance!  It's my 1st cd by PitBull and I think I'm going to order more of his music. I love the music and lyrics.

B004UID2LC|5.0|It works very amazingly on Kindle Fire. So far I haven't had any problems, so I rate it 5 stars.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Yes, it's definitely worth the money.  Why?  1. It has all 42 known recordings.  2. It is a much better sound than the remastering King Of The Delta Blues Singers (1 & 2).  Just compare Terraplane Blues and hear what happens on the KOTDBS when Johnson hits the high notes - chain saw - unnngghh my ears!  3. It leaves the previous box sets in the dust sonically.  4. It has an updated history 5.  The tracks seem to be in their correct order now as far as alternate takes go. eg. Come On In My Kitchen.  I also purchased a collection called Steady Rolling Man about 10 years ago which has all 42 recordings, it's clean but not remastered.  The Centennial Collection is definitely the most improved set out there.  I think people who say \\"Not another one\\" don't get it.  As the technology improves, so will the RJ recordings.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I  give it 5 stars because it's a kid game and free, my kids will enjoy it thank you amazon for the free games..
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This isn't mu favorite but it's not bad for a free download, it provides a quick diversion for short waits.
0525478817|5.0|I can't find the words to describe the greatness of this novel. This book may very well be an instant classic. John Green is my favorite author, and I will continue you to support his writing in every way possible. Read this book. It will change your life.
B004U52VPS|1.0|if this game is for 5+ year olds, get ready for a major disappointment.  pieces are cheap -spell that CHEAP.  the company had no business piggy backing off of the popular game.  if you want to encourage your kids to get real contact with hand/eye coordination - well this game is a sham.  jmho.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I just got my case in the mail a few days ago and I LOVE it!!! It perfectly fits the Fire and isn't bulky. But at the same time it is fully protecting my Fire. It has the best of both worlds - Light and thin but has great protection! The stand function is great and and the band to keep the cover closed or folded back is useful as well. I don't understand some of the bad reviews this product has gotten...Its GREAT! And the price makes it even better. Get this case!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|With acxf i wake up a little faster than the one i got on the android market because it tosses in subtraction too, forcing me to wake up to figure out why the blasted (in my sleepy mind) thing wont shut up. Before I just added and it would snooze.  I love the customize colors and being able to randomize the song, and all the rest of its features. Thank you for making such a handy app.    My only complaints are the dismiss is too small. It needs to be about twice its current size :-P I also dislike how it seems to use up more battery than the other one while idle. Solve those two and it would be worth buying the pro. :-)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|ive been looking along time for away of writing notes similar to Apple's note...not only did I find a replacement for it, Evernote is superior to &quot;notes&quot;.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for Christmas and I was amazed by the cheap price and also the high quality of the print. It was a total deal buying the three books together.  About the books:  Suzanne Collins managed to create a really breath taking story, once you start getting deep into the books you can't stop reading and your heart won't slow down. The characters are so well constructed and the logic of the story amazing. I recommended this to all my friends.
B006VB0ROG|5.0|This is one of the best new t.v.  shows on this season.  Great charactors and the script is really good. I love it.<br />It seems that all the better shows lately are Fantasy.

B006C1DH92|3.0|I do like the Bandito challenges.  The mini challenges add do a much needed element to the Fruit Ninja game.  This is perfect as a short attention span time waster game.<br /><br />The original Fruit Ninja game plays perfectly.  For some reason the new PIB version doesn't.  It's just too slow and laggy for this type of game.  I would give this game 5 stars if it weren't laggy on my main android device.<br /><br />On my tablet it plays very well, unfortunately on my phone it is too laggy.
0439023513|5.0|Call me crazy, but I thought this was the best of the three. I actually didn't read this one for a year because of all the negative reviews. It's a more mature story line as Catniss continues to grow up and starts to question the motives of those around her. A really successful ending in my opinion.
0307592731|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this wonderful book. Nearly twenty five years ago my older brother hitch-hiked from<br />California to Georgia and back at 20 years old. He has spent many hours retelling of his journey. After reading<br />Strayed's wonderful book I have a new found appreciation for the journey my brother took.<br /><br />The book is compelling and inspirational to say the least. So many things we think are too difficult or inaccessible<br />to us are just waiting for us to find the will and courage to try. Such great life lessons to be learned from Cheryl<br />Strayed's journey.<br /><br />Of course Cheryl Strayed went through many more harsh life challenges on the way to discovering and finding who<br />she was and what she was made of. She doesn't pull any punches in this book regarding her demons and desires. The writing kept<br />me engaged and I read it through in less than a week. I just couldn't wait to find where her journey would eventually take her.<br />Now as a best selling author with several titles to her credit, her story has even more power and impact; you never really know<br />what is possible and attainable until you test yourself to the core. This kind of backpacking adventure would surely do that.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to most anyone who is at a crossroads or feels like life is caving in around them.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Best free weather app. Has the best features and graphics. Did I mention that it's free? Download this app. You won't regret it!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|The colors, tiles and sounds are all high quality for this app, and I have played it on both my Kindle Fire and my Android phone.  I also like the choice of the red or green sections.  My one knock on this game is that it is hard to distinguish some of the tiles with matching flowers - it can be difficult to tell if they truly match, espcially if you are playing the game on your phone with the smaller screen.  But overall, it's a good app if you enjoy Mahjong.

B002KSPKRS|5.0|These headsets are pretty amazing.  My wife and I just had our first child and I wanted to continue to play in the evening without disturbing the baby.  These are perfect.  They work flawlessly and the sound is better than my surround sound system.  Additionally I can finally hear my friends speaking and they dont fall off like the cheap xbox headset.  I would reccomend to anyone who can afford them.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|it was most fun. I played a short segment of a level every night. I was on level 5 10. I updated it, and now it skips level 5 for level 6. level 5 isn't unlocked....bah. so what to do?
0891419063|5.0|I SURE WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS BOOK MANY YEARS AGO. EXCEPT FOR THE BIBLE I CONSIDER THIS THE BEST BOOK EVER. I WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH THE SLEDGEHAMMER FOR DAYS ON END. I WAS IN THE MARINES MYSELF BUT WAS CONSIDERED A WEEKEND WARRIOR. I WAS IN 1ST/ 23RD/ 4TH. MARINE DIVISION. IT'S A RESERVE UNIT. I SERVED SIX YEARS, 26 APRIL 1959 TO 26 APRIL 1965. IT'S A RESERVE UNIT IN HOUSTON TEXAS. I WAS IN A COMPANY, 2ND. PLATOON WHICH WAS MADE INTO A RECON PLATOON IN LATE 1960. MY SERVICE WAS AFTER KOREA AND BEFORE VIET NAM. WE WERE TRAINED JUST AS GOOD AS THE REGULARS BACK THEN.<br />  BACK TO THE BOOK. IT WAS VERY DESCRIPTIVE OF EVERYTHING SLEDE WENT THROUGH. I ALSO HAVE THE HBO SERIES, \\"THE PACIFIC\\" WHICH I HAVE WATCHED TWICE NOW AND I'M GOING TO WATCH IT AGAIN.....FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS NOW I HAVE TOLD MANY PEOPLE THAT I THINK THAT EVERY YOUNG MAN AND WOMAN RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THAT THEY SHOULD SERVE 2 TO 4 YEARS IN THE MARINE CORPS. THEY TAUGHT ME TO HAVE PRIDE IN MY COUNTRY, RESPECT, AND LEADERSHIP ABILITIES THAT YOU WONT GET ANYWHERE ELSE. I BECAME A PLATOON GUIDE IN THREE YEARS AND ALSO GOT MY E4 STRIPES IN THREE YEARS. THAT LEADERSHIP TRAINING I GOT HELPED ME TO BECOME THE PRESSROOM FOREMAN WITHIN SIX YEARS. I WORKED IN COMMERCIAL PRINTING FOR 38 YEARS AND WAS IN CHARGE OF 28 TO 30 MEN. I CAN THANK THE MARINES FOR THAT.<br />  SLEDGE HAD SO MANY DETAILS WRITTEN DOWN THAT HE KEPT THROUGH OUT HIS SERVICE IN THE PACIFIC. THAT IS AMAZING THAT HE WAS ABLE TO DO THAT AND GET THROUGH WITHOUT BEING WOUNDED OR KILLED. HE WAS TRUELY LUCKY. USING HIS NEW TESTEMENT TO ME MEANS THAT GOD WAS WITH HIM ALL THE TIME.<br />  I KNOW THAT I GOT AWAY FROM MY REVIEW IN PLACES, BUT IT IS SUCH A GREAT BOOK. I'LL BE READING IT AGAIN. I HAVE SEVERAL BOOKS ABOUT WW11, BUT THIS BOOK IS FAR ABOVE ANYTHING ELSE I HAVE EVER READ ABOUT WW11. THANKS TO SLEDGE AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF OTHER MARINES WE ARE FREE TODAY................KENNY  WILLIS, TEXAS
B00664BWI8|5.0|OMG! Best show ever. I have been obsessed with it since the first episode Iv'e seen. Damon is sexy as hell! (SPOILING) Episode 10 was just as amazing as the tension was broken. This show has had me hooked and if any of u guys friends make fun of you for being obsesses, it happens to me too! I love it and yes I wish Jenna was back!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I get this for my boy and I git go playin it and its just to durn hard. When a 43 yur old man can't do it, why would I let my 21 yur old boy give it a go?? This thing tried to tell me a bookshelf wasn't just like a table?? I can put books on both!!! Can I not? This thing is just to durn hard for any normal persen! I did feel that I should give it all 5 sturs because it shur looks nice with all dem colors. Ill give it a better score when ya make it a little more play able to my kid.
B006UAWJS0|5.0|Ok I loved how Damon finally broke the sexual tention between Him and Elena. This episode made me cry when Jeremy was compelled to leave. I really do reccomend this to every one who could ever have a chance to watch this. I actually became quite emotional at one point when Jeremy was being compelled to go to Denver and I did cry. If any one knows when episode 11 is coming out, lemme know. Anyways I hope you enjoyed this as much as I did, and Gosh I loved this episode. It wasn't as action packed as it could be, but that was good to take a break from it. It was more of an emotional episdoe, and the ladies will love it! For guys who get into this show, I am impressed! U r man enough to ejoy it! I wish I could rate it more then five stars.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of the best apps inky kindle fire. me and all of my friends play it. it is so awesome!
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Great cast, great writing, great score.  One of the best TV shows I have ever watched.  IF you like period drama, then you should be watching this.  I managed to find the full Season 2 on another site not long ago (before it was taken down).  No worries, I won't give anything away, but it was as good as the first season.  You be the judge.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun to play. kind of addicting. download for my kid, but I play it the most. recommend to everyone for some fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|smooth gameplay in the app. feature set is great, the ad is a bit annoying but not terrible. the font sometimes makes it tough to differentiate suit.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|This is the first time I used this seller.  It arrived before the projected date which was perfect since it was a gift.  Would definitely use again. Thank you.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I absolutely love this cover. My Kindle Fire fits into it perfectly and although it has a brand new smell it has faded over the last few days. It's beautiful and I have gotten several complements about it. I am so happy that I chose this cover.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Wonderfully simple Bible app.  Multiple languages, all the versions you want, in an app that just works.  You can download popular versions for offline use too.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|if u turn off ur wifi on the free version there are no ads, its the same as this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app  To God be the glory. I love having access to the multiple versions of the bible at my finger prints .
1410445224|5.0|I never read the book, but ordered and gave it as a Christmas gift to my son-in-law.  I had looked around locally for a copy of the book, but none was available, so ended up ordering from Amazon and wow it came in no time at all.  My son-in-law stuck his nose in the book and then couldn't leave it alone and later told me that he really loved the book.  So thank you Amazon.com for having it available.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I think this app is great. Some of them you need to hit the lightbulb to figure out what they have in common. So, kids that can't read will need some help.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great quality picture and sound! not so pleased with the changes, but I can deal with them! very pleased with my purchase! May the force be with you...
0525478817|5.0|Oh my God. This book is hands down one of the best books I have ever read, and probably will ever read. I sat down this morning, and did not get up until I finished. In that time, I had laughed more than I had ever laughed while reading a book, and cried more than I have ever cried. This book was truly a roller coaster of emotions, and I'm seriously sitting here tearing up again while writing the review. I had to pause for a moment, not able to write this immediately upon finishing the novel because it's almost like how can I possibly write a review that will do this book justice?  Of course everything I write is going to be spoiler free, but if you have not read the book, I totally recommend going into it with a fresh head and not reading any reviews, even the spoiler-free ones. I won't even tell my sister what happened, because though she is 13, I anticipate that she'll be reading this in the next year or two, and I still don't want to spoil it for her.  John. Oh John. You are just so GOOD. Your writing is always smart and witty and deep and powerful, so of course I expected no less for The Fault in our Stars. You pour so much meaning into every name, every sentence, every word. It was impossible for me to put this book down, I couldn't have even if I absolutely had to. You have such a way with words, it never ceases to amaze me.  These characters were fantastic. They were never played off or perceived as perfect, and that's what made this book what it was. Hazel's voice was so honest, I felt like I knew her. Everything was just so incredibly real about this book and this story. I was so invested in these character's and their story, and I truly cared about them with the bottom of my heart.  I'm seriously still mind blown by this book. There are very few life-changing books out there, but The Fault in our Stars changed the way that I view everything. That in itself is such a rarity. A book like this is going to be hard to top, but with John Green, anything is possible. His books are truly modern classics, and he will forever be one of my literary heroes. This is one of those books that I'll be thinking about for days. Such beautiful, powerful, hilarious but heartbreaking novel, that will really change your perception of life.  Amazing. Breathtaking. Smart. Witty. Heartbreaking.  I would give this book 10 stars if I could. In a heartbeat.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Challenging game. Controls are a bit wonky and lack sensitivity. Graphics aren't great. but it was free when I got it.
0525478817|5.0|I am not one for writing reviews on Amazon, I think the only review I have ever felt the need to write before this one was for Everything is Illuminated, but since John Green's audience is one that so champions community, I felt compelled to share my thoughts on The Fault in Our Stars.   The book arrived at 11am, I had finished it by 4pm. Not that it is particularly short, I just didn't want to put it down. I haven't felt such love and anticipation for a book since Harry Potter [and for whenever Safran Foer decides to turn out another piece of real fiction] and it did not disappoint.   I'll skip over reiterating the story of Hazel's experience with cancer as it has already been described by other reviewers. I will, however, describe the book as perfect. Not because it is the perfect book, better than all the others, but because it is perfect at being exactly what it is. It is not over-sentimental, the characters have flaws, they leave scars, they're resonant and real and beautiful in that way we would perceive our own friends, if only they were to be written down. There are no gimmicky twists or turns, but there were sentences that made my heart stop. Once the book was finished, unlike the protagonist's favourite novel, I knew that it truly was finished. It was complete. It had been everything I had needed it to be. This novel is contentment.   John writes so beautifully, and captures complexity so simplistically, and yet he does all these things interspersed with a wonderfully real, heartfelt, and witty dialogue between three teenagers. I laughed and I cried, I was glad to have been scarred by this book. It will long be a cherished part of my collection. I think all of our lives are made a little better by having John Green in them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good game.. Would recommend if you want to play solitare. Why does the review have to be twenty words? Word.
B003L77G8I|4.0|Everything was as expected. I had no issues and came very quick. It was a perfect gift for my sister.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The story is full of history, love, scorn, southern life, good food, friendship, risk, laughter and the truth/  The relationship between The Help and their southern tyrant female dictators is a fasinating tale with just the right elements of historical relativity and human kindness.  The characters are funny, shallow, social climbing women who do not care how they get where they think they want to go.  They ignore the gift of love and friendship to come out on top,  The young children that the maids care for all day steal the story and your heart.  It is so clear how much they care and how little the mother cares.  It is sort of like being behind the scenes filming GONE WITH THE WIND.  I loved it!  Please click \\"buy\\" when shopping at Amazon.com.  Amazon has been my book/movie store for a long time and they are wonderful.  Soooooo, start shopping!
1594744769|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I wouldn't say that it was a page turner, but it is a very unique story.  I really enjoyed reading a story that I haven't read before.  Just great! I would recommend to all my friends.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I loved this app. It is interesting and fun. It levels. are challenging and make you think. You can change the speed of the orbs and you can choose between two moods, survival mode and regular mode. What more can you ask for. I loved it all of it, except for the time limit. I mean several times I was one orb away from beating the level, and time ran out. I found that incredibly annoying. I would have played survival mode, but I like beating the levels. I really loved how the levels were layed out though. The idea of going through tubes to get to other tubes is genius. I highly reccomend this app it is 100% worth the price. If you are looking for a fun entertaining and somewhat addicting app, look no further. Dragon Fire is here.
B005I5UFG6|4.0|This download is great quality, as are all mp3's I download from amazon. I never listen to it anymore though because the radio had destroyed this song, as they do with many good songs. Replaying it repeatedly all day until you would rather rip all your hair out than listen to it one more time, even though you once loved it.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|EXCELLENT psychological thriller!! Gripping and horrifying. As I read on, I couldn't imagine what else would appear, how bad it could get.
B00417HV14|5.0|I have only a few things to say about this guy.  I saw him perform, after I saw this DVD.  I kept thinking WHO IS THIS GUY and why don't I know about him he is so good.  Clear notes.  Impassioned performances. . . Never missed a note.  After I saw him in concert a guy was coming out of the auditorium and said:  I \\"HAVE JUST SEEN GITAR JESUS!!\\".  Enough said.  You can see for yourself on this DVD!!
0312641893|5.0|A really good fairytale retelling is amazing because it takes a familiar, well-aged story and maintains those familiarities that we love but gives the reader a deeper appreciation for the story overall.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer has taken Cinderella to astounding new heights, incorporating a favourite fairytale with the action and intrigue of a sciene fiction novel, but with the emotion that ties it all together. An instant new favourite on my book shelf. Take a look at my copy in 10 years and I'm sure you'll find it well-loved and the pages worn, right next to another favourite of mine: Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine.<br /><br />Reasons to Read:<br /><br />1.A flawless retelling of a beloved tale:<br /><br />Flawless. I can't emphasize that enough. I have never been a big fan of the Cinderella story, but for some reason there seem to be hundreds of retellings on it and I've read a large proportion of them. Ella Enchanted is an old standby for it (and a must-read for every reader) BUT Cinder is just as good. JUST AS GOOD. Cinder and Kai are just as likeable as Ella and Char, and I loved them immediately. And there isn't any fairy godmother or glass slippers in this story, but it is just as enchanting. Cinder is the same overburdened, brave and engaging girl we know but is even more admirable for her strength and determination to give all that she can to those she loves. (Also, there's a little bit of Anastasia in here too. Just a few small elements in it, but it's there!)<br /><br />2.Impeccable storytelling:<br />Marissa masterfully lures you into her story world and creates this incredible adventure for you to become a part of- I mean literally become a part of the story, because that is exactly what it felt like. She is no stranger to writing, and her experience shines through easily. Is there a Marissa Meyer fan club? Because I'd really like to be a part of that. Somehow she takes this really intriguing, yet bizarre,  mash-up of inspiration and ideas to come up with a bold new face in the YA world. In doing so, she took a chance and completely succeeded.<br /><br />3.A whole new setting:<br /><br />I only briefly mentioned this above, but Cinder is a really great blend of ideas and I think the setting is the main way we really see evidence of this. Rather than being set in some Medieval fantasy world, Cinder takes place in the future with some distinctive science fiction, futuristic, even post-apocolyptic/dystopian elements. This really makes it stand out among other novels and sets the bar high for those to follow it.<br /><br />4.Widespread appeal:<br /><br />Not only does it's crossover with genres and the setting make it more interesting for wary readers (even male readers are going to find enough action and no overload of dull romance), with something for everyone. But even better is that it's going to appeal to such a wide variety of ages from younger readers (I'd say that as young as 11-12 year olds would enjoy this and find it appealling) to older audiences as well.<br /><br />This is the kind of book that will take the book world by storm. A very strong start for YA in 2012, one that will be difficult to follow up. I'm really excited for the remaining books in the series, and dismayed that we have to wait so long (Scarlett comes out in 2013). Presumably these next books look like they will feature other characters, but I'm so attached to Cinder and Kai that I hope we get to see much more of them in future books!<br /><br />ARC received from Raincoast books in exchange for my honest review; no other compensation was received., she took a chance and completely succeeded.   3.A whole new setting:  I only briefly mentioned this above, but Cinder is a really great blend of ideas and I think the setting is the main way we really see evidence of this.

1416955070|2.0|I only gave two stars (instead of one) because I finished reading the book. It's been a long time since I didn't finish a book but I really thought about it with this one. The world Clare created wasn't all that bad but the characters were flat and wildly inconsistent and I didn't care a lick what happened to them because of that.   Also, the writing. It was so bad! I almost choked on all the similes. There is one in every other paragraph through the entire book! And they are not good or original similes, either. The dialogue is forced and awkward. There are holes in the story that are never resolved or explained. It's just bad. Very sloppy storytelling. But, again, I forced myself to keep reading and finish it. For what it's worth.  I have the other two books, unfortunately, and I don't know what I'm going to do with them. Maybe these were written for much younger readers and so don't have the strong, beautiful writing of other YA novels.
B006GG1KOC|2.0|Probably too difficult for the intended audience. The visuals and sounds are nicely done though. The game developers just need to refine the challenge.
0525478817|5.0|TFIOS deals with sickness in a completely unique way.  It explores the complex thoughts of the sick teens which resonates wonderfully with the anxiety felt by all.  The characters are so well developed that I felt as if I knew them.  Hazel and Augustus make great main characters and are backed up by a variety of supporting characters featuring a complex range of emotion.  Green balances emotion well with the book being extremely serious while also making me laugh out loud, and it is must deeper than comedic relief.  TFIOS is a great read for high school age students and is certainly appealing to adults.  It doesn't feel like it is targeted at high school students other than that the main characters happen to be high school age.  It would make a great read for discussion circles and book groups of all ages.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Good graphics and sound.  Definitely gearded towards kids.  Would be fun to let the little ones play it for a while.
B005OK725M|5.0|canal+ and TF1 ensured this was art work. superb photography and classic Luc Besson. Thank god for the french. this is a classic movie. BUY.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far its loads of fun, simple fun and different games. fun for the whole family.  I definitely recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am a purist when it comes to solitaire.  This  came is even simpler than my favorite way to play - with a deck of cards.  :)
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I can't how entitled so many of you are.  the maturity level of people reviewing apps is apparently lower than this game's intended audience.   While flawed my three year old still enjoys killing time with this game. At a mere one dollar it's decent but I would recommend some sort of feedback when an answer is chosen.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the idea of earning points to buy other games; keeps it interesting. I hope future updates will put this game over the top.
B005KR6NJU|5.0|Amazon goofed. The prices got switched between the original package and the repackage. I dropped them a note and they said that they'd have it fixed in a day or 2.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|excellent little game to keep kiddies busy for a few minutes, thanks for the free apps! not sure how people don't know its for kids, ummm, the Icon is a ladybug folks. stop complaining about not liking all the FREE apps.
0453009115|5.0|i was very suprised at the quality of these used tapes  and the very low price but maybe i am the last human with a tape player in my truck arrived quickly and no damage,jim
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game! Finger-touch card movement is so quick and easy. For die-hard Solitaire fans, this version can't be beat. Best of all--it's free! I strongly recommend downloading this Kindle app!
B003ITZBVI|5.0|This is the best animated Batman movie I've ever seen. They managed to take some less-than-stellar storylines and characters and blend them into an action packed 75 minute film that hits all the right notes. Great voice acting and animation. Highly recommended, especially to Batman fans.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It's free, its fast, its just challenging enough to keep me entertained for hours on end and I'm completely addicted. I DEFINITELY recommend this game :)
B005D4Y522|2.0|The best news is lack of ambient noise in these live recordings. The orchestra sounds rather distant in spots. There are slow tempi, which at many points produces a loss of momentum and even a sensation of the music \\"dragging\\" along. Symphony 8 and parts of 3,5 and 9 especially seem slower in feel than even indicated by the timings. I thought that symphonies 4 and 7 fared the best, but even those were unexceptional. The packaging is high-end, but this set measures up to the recent Chailly only in that respect. The Rattle/VPO Beethoven symphonies come to mind as a comparable let-down.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Played Spider on my computer for years.  Now it is mobile for me on my Kindle Fire.  Great apt. Thanks
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Pros:<br />1. Colorful<br />2. Quick weather information<br />3. 10 day outlook is nice<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. There are no maps - no radar, no nothing<br />2. When adding a location, you enter a city and state and/or zip, but there's no OK button or the like.  Magically, you simply do something else and it's on your list of saved locations.
B00009R86L|4.0|I got this for use with my cooler. The pad is really good. I got if for my Fridge-To-Go FTG-1120 Romeo cooler. Which has a thin strap, but no padding. My shoulder was dying under the weight when the cooler got heavy.  The main issue is with it on all four sides of the velcro they used really crappy glue and it comes up on the very first use. I used some some Locktite super glue and let it set from a few hours to all four sides, and that fixed the issue.  Overall it's a relief to your shoulder.
0525478817|5.0|I have read (I think) all of John's other books (Looking for Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines, Paper Towns, Will Grayson, Will Grayson, and Let it Snow), so you could say that I am already a fan and Nerdfighter.  I have always found his books among the best and hardest of YA to read.  They are more thought provoking then fluff like Twilight and I have read most at least twice which I feel is necessary to glean them for all their hidden treats.  TFiOS is the best.  Hands down this is his best work thus far.  The characters have such clear voices, they pull at you and feed you. After reading in 13 hours, it felt that I could have gone to a phone book, looked up the characters and called them, they were so real.    One of my favorite parts in my first reading (I will be reading this again after husband and daughters) was the run-on sentences that made it hard to catch your breath and made you understand what is was like for the main character whose lungs suck at being lungs.  If you like intelligent characters, fantastic writing, and a moving story, then this is a MUST READ book.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love this book cover. It is the perfect compliment for my Kindle Fire.[[ASIN:B005I6EU7U Verso Prologue Case Cover for Kindle Fire, Tan]]
B004I1AGTC|5.0|I first saw part 2 while on vacation. I decided to purchase it so I could see it again and again at my leisure. I thoroughly enjoy the martial arts action and the seemingly impossible acrobatics of the various combatants. I generally only purchase movies that I know I can watch multiple times without boredom setting in and only those that can be \\"discovered\\" and watched by juveniles. This is one of those movies. My daughter called me and said the movies is available on Hulu.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 13 year old son for Christmas.  This is his first Perplexus.  Great for a rainy day.  It's durable and keeps you focused.  Good exercise for your mind.  One thing I will warn is (like a lot of other toys), this gets played with at first, and then finds it's way into the lonely section of the toy box.  I would not recommend this for kids under 6 as it will probably encourage tantrums!  It can be frustrating at times, especially when the marble falls off the track.  Over all, a good buy.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|good idea, but gameflow is a bit too linear. would have liked the option to create an individual account for my kids
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This game is fun and will definitely get your child to think. The graphics are cute and it works great on my Galaxy Nexus.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I love this game with one exception. it has way to many ads. I have no other complaints to be completely honest. what Canberra done about the ads?

B0058VW36U|5.0|one of the best games for the kindle fire. I could play this game all day if I really wanted to
0345529057|4.0|I bought this four book series last year and decided to read them all this winter in advance of the second season of Game of Thrones on cable.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones left me more annoyed than saddened as to the demise of certain characters. While I enjoy how a person's principles can lead to their downfall, I wonder that anyone can be as stupid as to reveal their entire plans to an enemy who says \\"when you play the game of thrones, you win or die.\\" Seems too shortsighted and foolish an approach for someone who seemed otherwise intelligent.<br />A Clash of Kings was not as clear to follow after Game of Thrones with some additional POVs that didn't necessarily add to the story. The ending is terrific and as before, my favorite character remains Tyrion Lannister.<br /><br />With finishing A Storm of Swords and now being on to A Feast of Crows, I have come to understand that part of what I have enjoyed about reading these books is Martin's ability to surprise. Just when you think you have a character pegged as black or white, Martin shows all their shades of gray. He's made me fall in love with his characterization; I could learn a lot from him. I'm not such a fan of the multiple POVs and have skipped some chapters as a result, but I'll also add that Martin definitely knows how to hook a reader at the end of each chapter and leave them dying to know how the next consecutive chapter in a particular POV will unfold.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I've never played a mystery game so I have nothing to compare this game to, but I am glad I gave it a chance because it is fun to play once you get the hang of it!

0439023521|5.0|This book was a great book to read. It is perfect for light and fun reading. Couldn't put it down, after finishing the book, I immediately bought the second book in the trilogy. Loved it!
0439023513|5.0|The whole series has captivated me. With its twist and turns of non stop action and emotion. mid evil times mixed with freakish emagination of todays unusual trends. Makes the elaboratons a visional site into each persons emagination, when reading all these books. simple love the way the hunger games are written. Thanks been years I found something worth reading.
B00005JKNF|5.0|We've been dottie for Gosford since it came out, for its humor, for its characters, and for its mordant comment on the grind that we are all in.  But we also knew it was a miracle of film-making, and the DVD clarifies why.  Visit with Bob Altman, Bob Balaban, and Julian Fellowes, and have a free year at a great film-school, watching as they conceive, develop, and then accomplish the magical feat of taking you to another world and letting you live there, if only for an hour and a half.  And the old tunes of Ivor Novello, performed to perfection by the brothers Northam, are worth the price of the film.  \\"There was a Roman hero, who had shaken hands with Nero....\\"

1849514003|5.0|A great collection of code examples presented in a straight-to-the-point manner. Each recipe is carefully chosen to be highly relevant to everyday game development tasks and allows you to quickly see what needs to be done to bring your ideas to fruition. The source code is available and is a veritable treasure trove which, alone, makes the book worth its price.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I am a Stephen King fan, but I usually have the patience or time to read a very long novel.  This one was 849 pages and to me that is very long.  But, it was so good that I could not put it down.  I read it in the morning before work, during my lunch break and began again as soon as I arrived home at the end of the day.  This was by far the very best book I have ever read.  The characters and settings were real.  Going back to the 50s and 60s was also a real treat.  The ending was fabulous.  I think Mr.King has outdone himself with this one.  You have to buy this book.  You will NOT be sorry
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game but can be very challenging at times. the games are fun but you have to be completely focussed unordered to win
B006GECE9Y|5.0|Installed it a couple of hours ago and comparing with stock (GTabComb) and Opera, it is outright a winner.  Flash works nicely, and looking at sites that don't come through very well with other browsers Dolphin does great!<br />All for a relatively light footprint - memory wise.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am a mid 40's midwestern mom of 2 girls, married 25 years.  I saw this was out and decided to get it.  Wow, well written, a little humor at times, some nice view points from his wife.  I have no one in my family in military, and this gives you some insight to it. While I am here raising my kids, going to basketball games and Target, this man was standing up for our country and protecting his fellow men. I have the utmost respect for him.  He did his job, which is a rare thing to find these days, from waiters to mechanics. I was in awe of the book, his story.  While someone with no military affiliation might wonder how a person can do this, I think reading the book will answer that question.  My admiration and thanks goes out to Mr. Kyle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed this app from the first time I played it.  it is my first kindle app.  easy to download and install.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its a lot of fun and its a great time passer especially for someone like me for when I have free time when my sons napping. :)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Awesome games for passing time with my son. He loves the challenge of getting points to unlock more games. Highly recommend for kids and adults!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I downloaded this for my 3 year old. I wanted to try it out before I let him play. The first few levels are a good teaching start for little ones. After that it gets harder than it should be for a preschooler. I will start playing this with him and stick with the first few levels for learning. Then go from there and see how he does. Still happy to see kids educational games as the faotd sometimes. Thanks Amazon!

B005LAIGMI|5.0|By Drew Morton for Cultural Transmogrifier<br />[...]<br /><br />Back in 1999 - it is hard to believe that it's already been more than a decade - director Steven Soderbergh was in the midst of a career upswing. He rocked the landscape of American independent cinema in 1989 with his award winning, high-grossing art film Sex, Lies, and Videotape. Yet, over the subsequent decade, his career floundered. His follow up, Kafka (1991) - his first collaboration with screenwriter Lem Dobbs - led to much head scratching. Here was a film with Jeremy Irons and Alec Guiness that constructed a fictional narrative around Franz Kafka while drawing on pieces of Kafka's work. Essentially, it's an anti-biopic biopic, shot in black and white with some color sequences, and nobody saw it. Soderbergh's string of failures continued after Kafka, and it wasn't until 1998 that he came back on the industrial radar with the critically beloved and modestly successful Out of Sight. After Out of Sight, his phone started to ring (and it hasn't stopped since), and he picked Lem Dobbs's neo-noir The Limey (1999) to be his comeback piece.<br /><br />I offer this context because the colorful collaboration between Dobbs and Soderbergh (one need only listen to the commentary on The Limey to get the lowdown) has never really changed. Like a pair of Jean-Luc Godards, Soderbergh and Dobbs pick a genre and strip it down to its essentials in order to go beyond it. Together again on Haywire (2012), the pair have made a revenge flick about a female spy, Mallory Kane (Gina Carano), who after being betrayed by the men for whom she works (Channing Tatum, Michael Fassbender, Ewan McGregor, Michael Douglas, and Antonio Banderas), returns to kick some ass...and maybe get a few answers.<br /><br />Like The Limey, Haywire isn't big on traditional characterization or exposition (it turns exposition into a running joke actually). The Limey used thirty-year-old footage of Terrence Stamp to add motivation, whereas Haywire draws on the tried and true - the scorned woman - in order to move on to other concerns. Yet, while the plot is rather conventional, the beauty is in the execution...literally. Quite simply, Haywire offers some of the best choreographed, shot, edited, scored, and mixed fight scenes since The Matrix(1999). While some may prefer the arthritic tremor of the Bourne films (2002, 2004, 2007), Soderbergh's geography is always well-defined; the action is always legible while still being messy and energetic, and - unlike The Matrix - it feels tactile, untainted by digital effects (which worked in The Matrix because they took place within a digital world).<br /><br />Soderbergh's film succeeds for many reasons - from David Holmes's Eurofunk score (who scored Out of Sight and the Ocean's Trilogy as well), to the director's ability to get top talent in bit parts, and to the director's eye for film form (he shot and edited the film under pseudonyms). Yet, it owes its success primarily to Carano, a former Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter Soderbergh saw on television and around whom he decided to construct a movie. As a non-professional actress among a sea of stars, Carano, as Kane, possesses a guarded nature that, considering her character, makes the minimal dramatic material work before she performs acts of violence on her male enemies. After feeling letdown by Lisbeth Salander and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011), I can get behind Kane as a heroine in a revenge flick because she's too smart and paranoid to wait to be victimized.corned woman - in order to move on to other concerns.

B004I1WIWU|5.0|I was skeptical when Adele came to the forefront of the music world.  With Amy Winehouse spiraling down, I thought Adele would be a talent we would enjoy for far too short.  She has proven me wrong.  Many artists fall into a trap where they spend years refining their first album, only to disappoint when they need to create another.  Adele has done the opposite. While her first album was good, this album is amazing.  The songs are predominantly about love, which is generally  a faux pas, but her songs are original and phenomenally written.  Her voice has become more powerful and controlled; it is clear she has a good voice teacher.  On vinyl, this album shines.  Like Brothers, by The Black Keys, the music just sounds like it was intended for vinyl.  I have both the mp3 album and the vinyl hard copy, and I prefer the vinyl.  The only thing I found a touch perplexing was the order of the songs.  Generally, the order of tracks indicates how a story is to be followed.  I felt that I'll Be Waiting should have been at the absolute end of the album.  As it stands, it ends with Someone Like You.  While that is a great song, it's quite a downer in terms of ending an album.  Other than that, I think this album is flawless and a great buy for any Adele album.
B0063GORYU|4.0|love the easy tap to play. great game for all ages. I just keep trying to beat my last game in time
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love being able to grab my notes from any machine, this alone makes evernote a necessity for me.  Evermore  is the last piece in becoming completely paperless for me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|definitely do not need another app after playing this. best free app yet. I love that you can buy more with points u accumulate.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote works as advertised. It works seamlessly between all devices. It is a simple way to get things that are on your computer to your smartphone.
B006UAWDBI|5.0|It just keeps getting better! They need to hurry and make fourth and release third NOW...lol. Ordered it on the air.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love how easy it is for me to look up verses and study from the you version. Bible. I wld recommend to anyone that wants God's word at their finger tips.
0143035711|5.0|I never thought it possible that another book could grab my attention the way \\"A Rumor of War\\" did - that is, until I read Chickenhawk. Having turned the last page at 4am this morning I am still wandering around in a daze - it has been an emotional roller coaster (or maybe helicopter) ride - the last few words have left me speechless - everything around me is quiet now except for the deafening images left behind. This book is powerful in every way and will affect everyone who reads it like no other, including the Judge. How Mr Mason has survived is beyond me.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|This really is a great little ap to help your children in associating and sorting. Some of the sets even made me have to stop and think....LOL. It's definately one to play WITH your child....the teaching aspects of this game go beyond just choosing a picture..it gives us parents a little tool to help educate without them getting bored!! Trust me, with an overly hyper 4 year old boy I'll take any help I can get!!!  Enjoy!!
0749941847|3.0|I liked the story line, content, and characters, but would have enjoyed it more without the foul language and raunchy sex.
B004XISI4A|2.0|I enjoyed the first three books. There were some really interesting characters and twists and turns. I don't know if dementure set in or what but Martin lost the plot in books 4 and 5, literally. It kind of reminded me of Anne Rice novels from the 80s. Way too much detail and side plots that were frankly boring and irrelavant. Meanwhile the really interesting plots moved at a snails pace.<br /><br />I am able to read boring documents - believe me - but this was just too much. I barely read half of it and I won't be buying the last book I don't think. Such a waste as there were some exciting stories building. He just made it too complicated and not in a good way. In an extrecutiating way. There should have only been 4 books in the series total, with all the crap removed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun variety of games to keep you interested /challenged! Just read.?  for quick. set of directions play for point'slots offing Kidd can play was well
B0054JZC6E|3.0|a mildly entertaining game, I have only played a few levels so far and it seems like a time killer. adsare a little annoying though
1451627289|5.0|Loved King's new book 11-22-63 !Very good and thought provoking! Just proves that King is still King and he's back !! I think people in their 50's etc. will love this look back in history and the \\"love story\\" that happens is very refreshing for king readers!One of his best yet!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games. some harder than others. some are a lot of fun to play and some are challenging. most of all a good way to kill time
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I purchased this cover for my Kindle and I have to say I just love it!  Great fit, well made and works great for hands free use since it is made to stand the kindle at the perfect angle for reading or watching a movie.  I would recommend this item for anyone who owns a Kindle.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great. It lets you play a game, if you beat it you get a selection of new games for free! It can get stressful but very addicting
B004EPYZPS|2.0|I have to say I had high hopes for Super 8.  Needless to say those hopes have been dashed. This was a flimsy excuse for a film which could have done with some more plot and character development and less of a cliche.  The ending was lame and was so contrived a placard could have spelled it out. The thing that I really hated was that up until the last few minutes the movie was actually quite well done.   The problem seems that no one could decide if the monster was good or bad and if should fear or hate it. It leaves us with so many unanswered questions and just wimps out.  All in all this is a very poor movie and is not worth your time.  I am glad I didn't waste my money when it was in the movies.
B006GG1KOC|2.0|its way easy and needs level selection options. the help button is to small. yep.. that's why it gets a 2 star.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|One of the most touching, heartfelt, humorous and well told story ever to be brought life into film. I read the novel and was excited to see the movie. The cast of characters did an amazing job portraying the women of this story. I hope this movie wins an Oscar. This is a must-see!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|way too short playtime allowed in games, this AP is not much more than a barely interactive billboard.  also only starts with 3 or 4 cheesy games playable
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing and easy to get addicted to cant stop playing some are hard and some are easy but dealt good game in my eyes
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|love this. but I have to keep inventing challenges since I perfected every level.  please bring out pt 3 already....
B000005KQT|5.0|i have always loved the harmonica ,and then i fell in love with the blues , but to be able to make an interment sound as it has feelings ,you can't get no better then that, we see ( hear ) why little Walter is considered the best,like Stevie Ray Vaughn with the guitar,its like they put all their emotions and feelings  into the interment, only the best can do that,little Walter is one of the few that could ,(or can) grate CD,,love it, !

B006GG1KOC|5.0|This game is fantastic.  My kids loved taking turns and guessing what the reason the others were the same.  I can't wait to see what else they have available.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I downloaded this for my 4 year old. She breezes through this in 30 minutes! She liked it tho. I'd give 5 stars if there was more levels and if there was a caption for each level.  Like a theme, perhaps?  Overall, very good game for kids.
0525478817|5.0|Such a great book. I hate when people say a book was \\"so sad\\" while trying to avoid saying that there is death in the story, as if they haven't already spoiled something by saying it was so sad. Obviously there is death. You can't have a book with cancer and NOT have death. But this book is still different than the myriad of \\"cancer kid\\" books out there.   Different, good.   Different, painful.   Different, meaningful.   Different, special.  It's filled with equal parts love and fear, hope and despair, humor and sadness. It's indescribable. Just do yourself a favor and read it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was different. than expected but good djdhdj djdjdh djdhd jsbdbdbd d dndbdb. jdbdndn jdjdjdjs ksksksks ksksksks ksksksjd jddjdndbs d d d d d d d d d d s s. s s sd
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Since I got it for free I didn't have high expectations but find it difficult to get the top score needed to get the Max points so that it takes longer to open new games
B0058EA3MS|3.0|The acting is superb, which made the content interesting. However, whereas it is a realistic depiction of the way humankind treats itself, it was rather sad to watch ! However, without Broadbent et al, it would not have been (really) worth watching. It is \\"okay!\\"
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game after following instructions on how to play. App works very smoothly on Kindle Fire. Sounds, colour, touch responses, and hints... it's all good.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Always being a sucker for a good zombie movie. Most are usually funny to me. I caught the all day marathon of The Walking Dead on TV only wanting to watch one episode to see what it was like. I'm hooked! Watched all the way through season 2. Now I can hardly wait for the new season to start Feb 12th to see what happens next!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games to choose from. Great if you are bored. If you do not like one of the games there are a lot to choose from.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app!  I love it so much I have it on both my kindle and my phone.  This app keeps me on track with my reading.  I especially love the special features like the plans provided.  I also use the Bible read out loud feature when I am in my car.
0446547654|4.0|Amazing price ($12) for a newly released hardback and purchasing 2 books shipping was free!  Great story - a little bit predictable - but as usual for a Sparks book- I didn't want to put it down.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Great game. Played it myself and beat it but my girl will love it. Well worth the download. Get it!
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Nice hide and seek game with a twist.Like the interaction......really nice for someone who likes mysteries. Well back to the game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Fun game to play but the amount of points needed is crazy. Some of the games are fun and others are not so good.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|No issues at all with this extender, highly recommend for those who need a way to connect or dock their iphones without having to take off the phone's case.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|It is the perfect fit. The case is flexible and durable and best of all it looks great! I love this case!

1451648537|5.0|Amazing story - amazing life!  Jobs would have been a tough person to work for or with...but in the end he will be remembered as the greatest innovator of our time.  This book details it all.  After almost 30 hours of listening I am a bit sad that the book, like his life, came to an end all too soon!  RIP Steve Jobs
B0054JZC6E|1.0|it is the worst app ever when you try to move something it takes to another place. I deleted. this app as soon as I got it
0439023521|5.0|This has to be the best book I have ever read, it has such an unusual plot, and theres nothing out there like this story. I've made many of my friends read it and their so glad I did. Following Katniss and Peetas love story, or Katniss and Gale's unreachable love story is just so intriguing. I got so excited when the Games finally came into the book and I could NOT put the book down after that. It's so diverse and interesting, I just love it. I would recommend ANYONE to read this, although It may be a little on the mature side for younger children.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its more fun than it looks,  the game are diverse and the point system makes you feel rich unroll you buy another game
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|At first I thought this game was going to be dumb. But now I realize I LOVE it. It is the most addicting game I have ever played.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is a great time waster if your bored. it adds an interesting element by making you unlock games by playing the other games.very fun.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is a movie talking about Chinese immigrant families life in the U.S. Very insightful. I use this movie in the Chinese language class. We stopped at the part where they started talking about the dead babies.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|During the past year, I decided to create a Christmas Holiday iTunes Playlist.  I built the Playlist with classic holiday songs and orchestra music that nearly everyone knows.  I added the Bublé Christmas album and I am very glad that I did.  I expect that this album will soon become a classic.  What a voice.  It's a winner.

0375842209|5.0|I had a difficult time getting into this book but after I did, it simply took on a life of its own. It is an extremely well-written story narrated by 'Death' that takes place in 1939-1943 in a small town in Germany during the Holocaust. The 'book thief' is a young German girl named Liesel who was given by her mother to two very different foster parents for safety reasons: Rosa, a woman with a big heart who constantly berates and curses, and Hans, a good and gentle man who teaches Liesel valuable lessons. Liesel experiences the worst that humanity has to offer a child.   Liesel was illiterate when she came to her foster parents but grew to love words after her foster father taught her to read...she loved words so much that she stole books and later wrote one. The family gives shelter and loves Max, a young Jewish man, until Liesel's foster father's kind act towards a Jew leads him to fear for Max's life.   I absolutely adored Liesel's character, as well as that of her next-door neighbor, Rudy; in fact, I think they are two of my favorite fictional characters ever. It will be a long time before I can get any of the main characters out of my head for they are so unique and wonderful.   I shed many tears during the reading of this novel, particularly in the end, but it was well worth it. I have a particular interest in reading about good Germans who hated Hitler and helped the Jews whenever they could; there have been too few written about them. This novel was perfect in that regard. I highly recommend it...and don't be fooled by the fact that it is classified as 'young adult.' In my opinion, it should be classified as adult fiction.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|simple graphics, simple instructions, simply fun. have only just started and I am looking forward to unlocking the remaining levels.
B003ES5ZTG|4.0|This wire helped me connect two componets in a very tight space. I think it is good value for the price.
B004H4XLR4|5.0|My 3 year old is OBSESSED with the movie cars and anything related to it. He watches the movies back to back for days at a time thats all he will watch.. He has almost all the cars and this spy jet was perfect. He loves to put holly, finn, and mater inside and fly them around the house on secret missions. Perfect toy and it is very durable, lol you can imagine he's 3 and very rough on his toys.

B000MRA5NS|5.0|Casino Royale features Daniel Craig's first outing as James Bond. How did he do? In a nutshell, here's what I thought of Casino Royale.<br /><br />GOOD<br />- good pacing. These movies always feel a lot longer than they actually are just because there's so much action<br />- looks sharp in high definition<br />- features great extras, if you're the type of person who watches those<br />- a great addition to the James Bond legacy<br /><br />BAD<br />- movie ends with somewhat of a cliffhanger that isn't resolved until Quantum of Solace<br />- movie is a little light on the \\"gadgets\\" that most Bond fans love<br />- the (spoiler alert!) torture scene was a bit awkward to watch<br />- I'll always consider Pierce Brosnan \\"my Bond\\" so getting used to Daniel Craig will take a while
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its prettey time consuming but some times fun definetly .I think it is a pretty good choice. try it your self.if you do not like it then do not use it but I dout that you will hate it. it is better than 100other game apps for sure
B004I744AS|5.0|very accurate and useful love the fact that you can use it both online and off and also the extra options you have when searhing  for a word such as starts with ------ , and ends with----------. very helpful
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I did't know what to expect from The Hunger Games series when I picked it up...but was captivated almost immediately. Just as Harry Potter lit a fire of imagination in me, these books rekindeled my love of storytelling. Suzanne Collins completed this epic series in spectaular fashion and enshrined this tome in literary history.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|Saw the movie first and then bought the book. It's written from the horse's point of view, in the style of Black Beauty, and is very well done. Very poignant but not as heart wrenching as the movie which didn't stray much from the book but has some gritty scenes. An excellent book.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Exccept for the hefty price, we love everything about this Garmin. I see others say the software is flaky.... NOT AT OUR HOME. And its visual display is EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED.

0307588343|5.0|\\"Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" is enlightening and allows you get the chance to reflect in depth on the market crash from a few years ago, while we stare right into the reality of the sovereign debt situation and the ramifications of those who once again hope and believe that it is possible to always kick the \\"reality\\" can down the road. As Larry says his dad always told him, \\"History always repeats itself.\\"  A great read and a book to keep and read again in future years to see the signs of future crises on the horizons.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|I didn't like it because it was too obvious,  short and boring. Mabey you could use real pictures instead of cartoons because it seems to childish.
006056251X|5.0|This is the third in the wallflower series and it was definitely the best. I wasn't expecting to enjoy it too much because I thought it would be unbelievable. Lisa Kleypas made the plot and the chemistry work with a stuttering heroine and a rake. The chemistry was incredible. It is a very touching story.
B00371QQ2U|2.0|ROCKY V may have tanked at the box-office, but that didn't stop Sylvester Stallone from reviving the Apollo Creed character from the original film and spinning him off into his own franchise. By the time this THIRTEENTH installment was released, the series had run out of gas. The film is probably best remembered for it's tagline, \\"Yo, Houston! It's me, Rocky...\\"
B006GG1KOC|3.0|Looks like a great game, and I have two tiny ones who would love to play it.  I have high hopes that the developer will update it to make it Nook-friendly. Thank you anyhow!
B002BVYBBK|4.0|Charismatic Vin Diesel leaps to the top of the action heap portraying a new kind of hero: a no-nonsense daredevil of a \\"streetracer\\" who's \\"Fast\\" with the ladies and \\"Furious\\" with those who cross him, (hence the movie's title). Diesel oozes testosterone in every frame of this high-powered, thinking man's action pic that's sure to delight road scholars and the follically challenged.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|How can you NOT like Kung Fu Panda 2?? It is a beautifully done film, with a deep message of the power of love and healing. If anything, I find it was even better than the first one! My big hope is that a third one will be done. The ending of 2 did seem to give the idea that a third one would be done.<br /><br />This is a wonderful series, full of strength and hope. If I had kids, I would be very happy to have them watch these movies. With the attitude of kids these days - self centered, nasty minded and nasty mouthed, I think we should tie ALL of them down and make them watch this over and over - maybe they can learn to care about something other than themselves!<br /><br />Definitely added to my 'must own' list!
B000002MY3|1.0|What makes Alanis such a treasure is the honesty of her convictions and her absolute allegiance to commoners everywhere. When she plaintively emotes \\"I've got one hand in my pocket,\\" you realize she could be singing about anyone.

0385344325|4.0|I am a big fan of the Reacher series. This story filled in allot of the blanks / history referenced in prior books. Although I really didn't get the same excitement I normally do out of the books. This one just didn't seem to have all the twists and intrigue that is the normal.  I did like the book though and am impatiently awaiting the next!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app, use it daily. Easy to use, with nice graphics and text. A must for anyone who needs to plan according to the forecast.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|it's all right. most of the games are really hard, confuses, frustrating, and .... just weird. I think it is frustrating.
0920668372|5.0|Several years ago, I purchased one of these for each of my children and my grandchildren.  I loved the book and wanted them to realize how much I loved them and that I would love them forever. My daughter-in-law had one son who is in service for our country and was looking for something similar. I ordered the book for her and she loved it and mailed it to her son. We absolutely loved the book.

B003CR9BYE|3.0|First off, music wise, Bossa Nova vocal recordings doesn't get any better than this. And for recent Sinatra collectors, this is just what you need to acquire all of his recordings with Jobim. Three cuts were always elusive and are included here. One, Desfinado, has finally been issued complete with the instrumental introduction. For some reason, this was cut on the original release in 1995 on The Complete Reprise Studio Recordings. So for a completist like me, this was essential. Sinatra has never sung so tender with silky wave like patterns as he did when he recorded with Jobim. If you need to wonder why Sinatra was the GREATEST male pop singer to have ever walked the earth, this is a great example of his art. The song selelctions are all Bossa Nova classics, great arranging and great conducting all combine for a musically satisfying album. Now for the bad part. The remastering. Concord has been reissuing a lot of out of print Sinatra recordings for the past two years now. Their first album reissue, My Way, was done well. I was hoping that the other releases would be as good sonic wise. This would not be the case. Their follow up release, the Jobim recordings, shows just how bad the remastering is. Not only is the remastering poor, they used tapes that have flaws in the recording. This is strange since Larry Walsh has previously remastered other Sinatra recordings. I have purchased those and while there were no major improvements in sound, they didn't have any glaring problems either. Sadly that is not the case here. For \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\", Sinatra phrases the opening line differently, in which he does the entire first line in one breath. This is NOT the same take that has been issued in the past. Then Frank's voice cracks on the word \\"day\\". This must be a different take since the percussionist plays different notes at this part too. Why would you use a take that shows the artist in poor form??? What genius green lighted this?? Then there is the sound. God isit bad. They sucked out all the studio ambience and reduced the sound stage. The guitar intro for \\"Girl\\" originally had a wonderful, warm soundstage with a nice air of naturalness around it. Now, it sounds cold and thin. Sinatra's voice is dry, but close, since they removed all that nice studio reverberation. For Dindi, the original release had a wonderful concert hall sound to it, now it's completely dry. Then on Meditation, the bassist plays a wrong note toward the end fo the cut. For \\"Corcovado\\", the word \\"my\\" at the end of the song is phrased differently, indicating that this was a splice from another take. At least with the second half of this album, it isn't the odd takes that is in question, it's the sound stage. For Agua De Beber, Jobim was previously on the left, but Larry Walsh decided to move the entire rhythm section to the center. Gee, might as well make it mono. And they seem to reduced his volume and Jobim's vocals are harder to hear than in previous issues. For \\"Triste\\", the cymbal crashes in the bridge of the song would have a nice beautiful decay. Now when the crash comes, it hits and then just disappears suddenly. This is no doubt due to the fact that they removed all that nice reverberation. Terrible. Two great artists like this shouldn't be presented this way. If you are lucky enough to have the 20 bit reissue of Francis Albert Sinatra and Antonio Carlos Jobim, do not even bother with this. The 20 bit has all the correct takes and is presented in the best sound that album has ever enjoyed. This one is AWFUL in comparison. So if you are an audiophile, please avoid this unless you are a completist.
0393064476|2.0|Mr Greenblatt is an entertaining writer to my tastes and make rather dry information readable and interesting. As a story of the discovery of Lucretius's 'The Nature of the Universe' the book does a commendable job, so far as my limited knowledge of the period is concerned. Assuming its accuracy, it is informative and detailed for the novice to the period without being overwhelming concerning the poem, its discovery, and the history that may have brought it to the monastery where it was found. This long tale takes up much of the book's content and there in is the failure of the work's premise.  The book purports to show how Lucretius's poem was an important work in shaping our modern worldview. Unfortunately, the writer does this in a very brief couple of chapters resulting in an argument of little more depth than a college sophomore term paper. Nothing shows how the poem uniquely propelled anyone's thought in ways that other works of art, literature, or science might not have nor how events of historical, economic, or political importance were overshadowed or set in relief by the poem in shaping peoples' thought down to the modern day.  An entertaining writer, but a claim of such scope as this book makes requires much more than this book presents in order to be convincing.
B001DEAAIY|5.0|Good quality blu ray. Thanks. Suitable also for Australian devices. Postage took around a month but that was expected over the Christmas period.
0439023513|1.0|This is my first AMAZON review although I have been reading books and purchasing items for years.  I felt so compelled to write my first review after a truly disappointing 3rd book in The Hunger Games series. The first book was sheer perfection and I devoured it in a couple of hours.  The second book was OK.  Bu the third book was a disaster.  As another reviewer pointed out, I found myself skimming and scanning sections.  Way too much description on weaponry and other issues, very little dialogue.  As a heroine Katniss is a true tragedy.  While I understand the writer's intent to depict the influence that war has on human beings, I found myself hating Katniss.  What was wrong with her?  So manipulative, self-centered, and egotistical.  It seemed that everyone could see these characteristics, but her.  I had hoped for some kind of self-realization that Peeta had sacrificed everything for her.  In the end, Katniss seems devoid of any real feelings for anyone but herself.  Again, a disappointment of a book and very little hope for redemption.
0525478817|5.0|I'll start by being honest- whilst I've been a big fan of John Green's for a number of years his young adult books have been enjoyable, but never really stood out for me personally. I'm an english lit student currently as well, so my time to read for recreation is unfortunately limited. This book changed everything however, and I ended up reading it in one night over two sittings, with just a short break in between. I was stuck in place.  I always find that when I'm enjoying a novel the characters will leap off the page and suddenly I'll find myself in everyday life, asking things like \\"what would x think about this?\\". Hazel and Augustus became this so quickly that I couldn't get back to reading fast enough, becoming so invested the plot. The emotional level was fantastic, mixing humour and melancholy so well that my emotions twisted with the characters.  I don't know how much more I can say to be honest, I think since I finished the book not long ago I'm still processing it! I'll say this though- I was hoping this book would be as entertaining as Green's other works and it just exceeded my expectations beyond belief. I'll be recommending it to everyone.  P.S. thank you for the signature as well John, I really appreciate you taking all that time to sign that insane amount of books :)
0307949486|4.0|Some blatant Mary-Sue business, an oddly protracted third act, and rampant editorializing kept me from loving this book. But it is saved by strong characters and a wonderfully compelling plot. Worth a read. Small wonder this became the darling of book clubs everywhere. It has the same appeal to me that the series 24 did. It's not great, and it has some serious flaws. But it really reaches out and grabs you by the throat.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|works on kindle fire but after about 3 games it will randomly close. never the less I am addicted. there are a ton of levels and it keeps track of your progress.
0525478817|5.0|DON'T WORRY, NO SPOILERS HERE  u will notice that my review is written only 2 days after the books' release. i don't know that i've ever finished a novel this fast, save for really short ones like 'of mice and men.'   john green's style of writing is proof-positive to me that charles dickens was damn long-winded. something can be just as funny, tragic, and beautiful when written with simplicity and sincerity. i can say with full confidence that there was nothing sincere in dickens' paragraph-long sentences describing inanimate objects. in contrast, TFiOS is able to be full of philosophical quotes and incredible introspection, without having a shred of pretense.  the story itself aside, i liked very much how he dealt with the heroine's voice. it was not awkward at all to read this book, written by a grown man, from a teenage girls' point of view. what i admired so much was that he did not baby this character- make her overly feminine, because that is how many male writers tend to write women. hazel is, instead, fully intelligent and three-dimensional, and not some insecure or vapid or weak teenager. there is no over-abundance of girl-talk- she is just another protagonist, who just happens to be a girl.   thank you, john, for giving us this modern heroine. when i watch my contemporaries fall to caring what lip gloss kim kardashian wears, i know it must be because there is a dearth of female role models to show young girls that they can be the fighter in their lives, not the one whose sole purpose is to be saved.
0439023491|5.0|I absolutely loved The Hunger Games so as soon i finished that book i picked this one up.  It was hard to get into at first but after a couple of chapters it brings you right back in just like the first book!  I enjoyed this book very much.  Suzanne Collins really knows how to make you feel like you are apart of this world.  I laughed & I cried while reading this.  I have recommended these books to all my friends!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Free apps... Rate low and the developers have decreased incentive to continue future improvements. Rate high as a way to say hey thanks for the FREE app and I bet you the app gets better and better. I'm disappointed with the degree of scrutiny Amazon app folks appear to have. Ever tried to make one? Ha.
0439023521|5.0|This was such a great book. I couldn't put it down, & when I did all I wanted to be doing was reading my book! I highly recommend The Hunger Games to those of you who have yet to read it!
B0028ER4PK|5.0|My vinyl collection has started. What else would i get first besides my favorite bands best album. Of course L.A. Woman. Sounds fantastic on my new Sony (plug plug) record player. I can feel the weight difference between these new 180 gram albums and some of my original prints. Not sure but i would think the album would flex less after repeated usage. We'll see. Looking around seeing prices of $30 and well above for classic rock albums makes this even better. Under $30 is what i paid for this. If you like The Doors and vinyls then it's a no brainer. If you don't like The Doors-GO AWAY! I don't wanna know you!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. does what it says. fun little games to pass the time. the adds aren't really that bad, just a quick little skip click.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Works for me it gives you lyrics and everything you could hope for.  I don't know what benefits of you get with the paid version
0142403873|5.0|The Gruffalo is one of our favorite books. A very clever story with a couple twists and turns that we didn't see coming. We love the way it rhymes and flows, and the surprises it has in store. Such a smart little mouse!!
B0016J81B4|4.0|These Crocs are perfect.  Well, almost.  They function well.  After owning 2 previous pairs of crocs, first the classic with the holes in the top and the second were the crostrails, I settled on these for my third pair.  I'm a medical professional and am on my feet for 8-10 hours at a time.  I really this pair.  They are comfortable for long periods AND they get good traction even when the floor is wet.  There is a different tread on these that is not on most Crocs.  I occasionally get \\"body fluids\\" on my shoes and since there are no vent holes in top or sides, there is much less chance of getting \\"stuff\\" on my feet.  General non'adjustable strap on heel.  No vents, so feet sweat a bit more in these compared to the classic and crosstrail, but worth it for clean socks and feet.  I've had them for a couple months and they have been holding up great.  The others' soles wear down pretty quick and when the floor is wet, they become like air hockey pucks and you better have mad shoe skating skills or you'll land on your a**.  so far so good for the Bistro.  No significant slippage even on ice.  I would definately recommend these shoes.
