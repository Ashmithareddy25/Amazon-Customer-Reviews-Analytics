B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is a great read.  I wanted to read the REAL book before I see the movie.  I saw the theatre production in London in1993/1994.  I am enjoying the story immensely!  Hard to put down.  I love the way Victor Hugo writes, even when he expands forever!!<br /><br />Georgia, Nevada City, California
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are like a swiss army knife workhorse.  I listen to a variety of music, and while they may not be ideal for any one kind of listening (e.g. I love Beats for hip hop/rap listening), they provide excellent all-around sound.  I also do some audio recordings, and they are fantastic for that.  They are durable, and all the parts are replaceable.<br /><br />My main motivation for getting these is that I know that what I'm listening to will be almost exactly how the producer wanted it to sound--because they were using these exact headphones during the recording sessions.
B0091XIZO0|5.0|I don't particularly agree with the critics of Lang Lang.  I think he is very unique, and this is the biggest reason for his success.  He does and plays what he enjoys regardless of what anyone says.  He is what classical musicians, pianists in particular, should be in 2013.  Lose the tuxedo and bow tie.  Young people are turned off by this.  Dress trendy, and you will gain a larger younger audience.  Keep listening to the old fogies of the past who criticize Lang Lang, and one day we may have nobody listening to classical music.  I have no doubts it will die if the presentation of this kind of music does not change!<br /><br />Oh, and about the CD:  It's phenomenal.  Very clearly recorded sound, perfect technique, intensely expressive.  This set of Op. 25 Etudes, along with John Browning's recording, are my favorite Chopin Etudes.<br /><br />Lighten up, people.  Lang Lang is great.  Get over your classical music snobbery and judgmental attitudes.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I think this is Emma as Jane Austen intended it.  Romola Garai is simply perfect, and Michael Gambon was an excellent Mr. Wodehouse.  The dance at the Crown Inn was my favorite.  You can actually see Emma and Mr. Knightly falling in love.  The music is so beautiful as well.  It made the book come alive for me.
0345529057|5.0|I've been watching the series on HBO and reading the books before the season makes the show much more enjoyeable.
B008133MDK|3.0|This is definitely NOT something for the kids to watch!  The nude scene, although it is more suggestive the explicit, was definitely shocking to me--I was surprised that was in there.  I did enjoy the 'Hounds of Baskerville'.  And the 'Riechenback Fall' is still a tantalizing mystery...how could Sherlock have survived that fall...?!?
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Especially if you love a mystery with action and the good guy always winning.  There's a little something for all readers in Lee Childs - Jack Reacher - books.
B0029XZODY|5.0|I LOVE dexter im such a dexters disciple hahaha love it alot. OMG i would be soo happy with an autographed series
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I enjoyed the story line, but was not prepared for the &#34;X&#34; rated scenes (seriously, I'm not just being a prude).  Should have done a little more research before purchasing.  It is definitely not for children!  Parents use caution.  Sadly, the story would have been just as good without all the nudity and sex.  It's a good enough mid evil flick if you like the genre, but be prepared, many of you will be offended and shocked by the adult scenes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the characters, the house, the accents....Everything! I hate to see the season end and will now have to wait for Season 4!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|If you like the series 24 you will definitely like Homeland.  The story moves smoothly between personal, political and terrorist sub plots.  It  keeps you guessing about who the real bad guys are.  I am definitely intrigued and involved in the lives of all the characters and I'm looking forward to catching up on the 2nd season to see where the story takes me.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I have seen all of the episodes when they came out so it is refreshing to watch them again... my wife has never seen them and she absolutly loves them.
B0085TJUGI|5.0|Loved the book. Very meaningful and helpful information. It's very understandable and inspiring. Loved reading about the different cultures. Inspired me to hear Anita Moorjani speak personally if given the chance.

B00973DDN2|5.0|I read through all the bitch'n and complaining from people that don't like this album, but simply can't understand it. This is a great album standing by itself. If its not what you expected, then the problem is you, and not The Killers. Brandon Flower's vocals continue to be outstanding, but the whole band is just great. Buy it and enjoy !!
B009O07NDY|5.0|I love this movie.  I've seen it six times!  The music is fantastic.  Especially love &#34;Misty Mountains&#34;.  The price was right.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Watch Bruno Mars on Saturday night live and left after the show knowing that Bruno Mars was a real talent. He could sing in multiple genres and did throughout the show, from his own modern pop to Michael Jackson and singers back in the Motown days. With that kind of versatility, the album had to be good, and it is. Also, love to watch the &#34;ripples&#34; performed by the back up band on videos. Bruno knows how to Rock and Roll  !!  Buy this.
B00579EL18|5.0|This 1968 recording from the Metropolitan Opera is typical of the quality from that time ... before Levine came in to 'clean the place up'.<br />This 1968 recording from the Metropolitan Opera is typical of four-act performances the New York house presented at that time ... before James Levine arrived and cleaned the place up.  The sound is better than a home recording made from a Saturday broadcast would have been.  Unfortunately, that also magnifies some of the sloppy performances.  Corelli is, of course, Corelli ... thrilling a times but not averse to taking the liberties his fans waited to hear.  Rysanek is in fine voice as are the rest of the cast, including  the baritone Herlea, here making his Met debut.  The drastic cuts made to the five-act score make it almost impossible to listen to anything but the singing ... so wallow in it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Must read. Can't stop until you are done! Intriguing story of a lost boy, self revelation, and ultimately love. I would read it over and over.
B004TACMZ8|3.0|I love getting the best tool for the job and after reading two different articles in fine homebuilding I thought this was the one. After reading the reviews and trying it out I am second guessing my decision. It is not always accurate finding studs, and really bad at finding ac wires. I have scanned all around a few live outlets and it never went off.
B006OB3K56|5.0|I very much enjoyed this film. It is obviously very sexual due to its NC-17 rating, but it is more than a movie about sex. It concentrates on the negative side that most people don't think of. I believe it is a well written and the cinematography is just as good. The actors are right on the money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great for the road it have a good selection of characters and surf boards.it's more for kids and teens and early teens
1475143389|4.0|I was refered to this book by a friend.  I am 43 and probably like a lot of men at my stage in life with a busy career and family life, I was looking for a way to make better improvements in the gym.  My lifting style previously can be described as midlle weight, middle # of reps, with some circuit training, mostly free weights.  I had even done some P90X and Insanity which I found good for cardio but not so much for strength-building.<br /><br />So, cutting to the point, following the book's method of heavy working sets with fewer reps will undoubtedly make you stronger, pretty quickly.  And it's pretty amazing considering you are only working out each muscle group about once per week.  I made about a 20% improvement in my bench press working sets in 4-6 weeks.  At that 6 week point, I strained my right pec and laid off chest workouts for about 8 weeks.  When I restarted, I eased into at my original starting working set weight (225) and strangely, have jumped up to 285 in six weeks.  Not sure how to explain it, as I cut down on my protein shake intake.<br /><br />Now entering my first cutting phase, I hope to be able to come back and update this review and rating to a 5 after I drop about 20 lbs (210 to 190) to achieve the look I want.  Probably like a lot of guys my age, I struggle with the belly-fat.  Am about to buy the recommended body fat calipers to determin my starting point in that respect.<br /><br />In summary, following the bulking phase has worked well for me, especially on strength gains.  I need to maintain good diet and cardio discipline to gain the desired cutting effects.  I have a feeling that will be the more difficult phase but am motivated to try it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I bought this movie for my stepdad who is a dog lover.  It is a very sweet movie, but sad, too.  It is also a great family movie and very clean!
1594135851|5.0|I got into reading these Hunger Games series last year and I cannot get enough! I cannot wait until the 2nd movie comes out!<br />This book get 5 stars because it had me turning pages so fast and kept my interest the entire time!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is the best app for battery information. It tells you how much overall battery life you have, how long it will take to charge, how much battery life you have for different uses of your kindles etc. Well worth the few dollars to have all this information.
B005PK56TA|5.0|If you haven't started watching this you all I can say is you're missing out. If you love scary movies and creativity this is for you! I watched this when it was on but wanted to rewatch them. Obsessed!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|All hype
B006Z21ZJC|3.0|Obviously this is a well produced piece of audio, as for the video, Iron Maiden has decided to go along with the newer trends in movie/video editing and cater to the ADHD demographic. The tour is also from an album that has some excellent songs, some ok songs, and a few duds. My favorite tracks from The Final Frontier are Starblind, Talisman, Alchemist, Mother of Mercy, & Isles of Avalon, only one of which I even get to hear live. The opening track is ok, Eldorado is a notch above ok, and when the wild wind blows definitely has its moments, but overall, very disappointing because after the new tracks, all you have is the same old stuff, most of which I can dig out much better live versions of. I guess my main complaint is Iron Maiden's inability to whip out more new material or at least the rare gem that hasn't been played in forever. Still Life maybe? Flight of Icarus? Invaders?...hell that one has never been done live as far as I know. I'd even settle for Sign of the Cross. Com'on Maiden, let's think outside the box a bit here. The coolest thing they've done in recent memory was play the entire Matter of Life & Death album front to back. The album is a bit of a mixed bag, but I liked it, and playing the whole thing was a nice middle finger to all the has-been fans who come out to hear the Trooper.    For me, as a huge fan, when they put out some new live stuff, if there are some kick-a$$ tracks on the new album, then play that s***! I'd love to have a good live version of Starblind. That song is bad-a$$!    Anyway, good audio, good show, nice video production minus the seizures and ADHD format, but I'm sick of the same old stuff. The best version of Fear of the Dark has already been done. At least throw us fans a few more rare treats.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Hype led me to believe would be better...very Harlequin-esque.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I ordered season 3 for my husband, He is hooked on Breaking Bad. We are the kind of people who watch Boardwalk Empire and True Blood.

B0076DELIG|3.0|It was a good book but not an I can't put it down kind of book.i do like the Harry Bosch books and I will  keep on reading them
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The series has exceded my expectations. I have found the history component thought-provoking and the<br />story line capivating. I can't wait to catch up to season 3!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|When I first heard about this book I immediately wanted to read it because I am a Kennedy fan for starters and a die hard king fan. Took me a quite a while to read it but it was well worth it. Will read it several more times and would love to see it be made into a movie. Either by Stephen king himself or somebody like Ron Howard.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|I loved this book. It has a lot of advice on how we should live a wonderful and peaceful life. It's amazing what books like these can help you realize.
B009Y7YC2M|5.0|I love this recorder.the sound quality is very good compared to my previous recorder in which the sound was very low and I had to use headphones hear my music recorded from my choir rehearsals. Now I'm pleased.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I used to hate the book Emma, why? Cause I saw the gwen p version before reading the book and that's all I pictured while reading it!<br /><br />But this version is far more superior! Romola Garai is endearing is this film! BBC does it again
B0083Z614S|5.0|The Secret Garden has long been a favorite book of mine and I was especially happy to discover the Kindle version that I could reread on my iPad.<br /><br />One of the things I always check is whether there is a Table of Contents. In the menu it does not show one, but sure enough, it is there, right after the Title Page. And, it links appropriately to the correct chapter.<br /><br />Other than the fact that this is a classic well-converted to Kindle, I have always loved the idea of having my own secret garden, my own place. Recently we moved to a home which sits on 1/3 acre, with a privacy fence, and I find myself discovering new miracles in my garden as well. Who knew that the bulbs planted by the previous owners would show up in MY garden. And that tree in the back yard is a black walnut! Last year I focused on a victory garden, but threw in some flowers as well. This year the food will be back, but last fall I carefully planted hundreds of bulbs to come up this spring.<br /><br />The Secret Garden brings out the child in all of us, the children who want mystery and hope. And like my other favorite, Heidi, hope wished for is hope fulfilled.<br /><br />I'm grateful to have added this to my library!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game. I really recommend it, it's great! If you don't like it, check it out and I know you will!

B005OCHOZS|4.0|Although Jurek is a mite bit narcissistic, he has earned it with the training and race history he's accumulated. I read this after Born To Run, and while I did not find the vegetarian foods to my liking, the stories and preparation he documented was very instructive.<br />DAB
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This story kept me interested. I could not put the book down! I think that women who  are beaten by their spouses should read this. Plus it is a sweet love story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app! It is so realistic. You can actually feed it. And name it<br />I really love the mini games that you can play.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Its very addictive so be careful, a great way to pass the time. just watch out that everything around. the house don't pile up on you why you are playing this great game. I had the other older one and love this its more fast pace.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|i'm digging this album. her voice is good and the lyrics are enjoyable. i learned of her when i saw the video for lost & found. i hope she continues to do more work. she's on par with other notable british talents. i like that this music is light and upbeat, not a downer. i listen at work and when i want to just chill and relax.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series!  My husband and I enjoy watching it together.  Watch out its addicting! ;0)  Amazon does a pretty good job of streaming.  There are times that it will get pixelated, but it will recover quickly.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I absolutely love this game I had my high scores special boards from the world tour but I went to get on it and all my data was erased please get this fixed Ik its too late for my game but Macbeth u can save someone else's data :(
B000FBJHT4|4.0|I enjoyed the detail's and the possibilities of alien influence on todays world is fun to ponder.  I would recommend this book for anyone that considers the Roswell incident still up for discussion.
B0095DC0B0|5.0|There was not a bend or crease even in the packaging (well done DHL and Marvelio LLC!) and regardless of the weather conditions these past months, my record arrived in pristine condition. A wonderful treat for Opeth fans, audiophiles, and music lovers alike.The 180 gram really helps project Martin Lopez's (Opeth's former drummer) soulfulness and drumming mastery and the overall haunting aura of the recording. A record of this caliber shouldn't be played on just any old record player, make sure you're using the best phono cartridge you can afford -especially if you plan on selling or trading this record down the line, you want to make sure your record is in as good condition as possible- and handle your record like a serious investment. A great album, worthy investment, buy it...but it NOW!
B0033AX26I|4.0|On this album The Chieftains, the best known ambassadors of Irish traditional music, pursue the history of Irish nation and take us this time to Mexico, where the Irish have fought in the San Patricio brigade in the Mexican-American war in 1846-1848.<br /><br />The album has a great deal of Mexican rhythms, tunes both sad and happy, that will make you stand up from your chair and dance so as sit quietly and think about the men who have lost their lives in the battle of Churubusco. I believe that this CD will make happy anyone who loves Irish or Mexican traditional music as much as I do.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|There was nothing held back. I not only felt that I got to know SJ, but I felt I was working by his side. This book gave me insight to my boss' behavior , and helped me with dealing with some difficult issues.  Genius.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it it has good graphics and I am also doing this for gems. You can do this game without money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this app is neat it is free and my daughter loves to play it. The horse is very realistic.
030758836X|1.0|This is the kind of book that is purposely written to set people on edge. Flynn is reaching out to the stereotypical bitter housewife that secretly wishes she could punish her husband for all of his incompetence.<br />The book is sold on its twist ending. If you go into it assuming this, you'll be able to guess the ending within a few chapters. Basically, the author went for the ending she knew would get a rise out of people so her book would get more publicity. It's not well-written, and frankly, neither is the rest of the book. It's all based on getting attention and twisting the knife to get people talking.<br />I'm the type of reader that adores a good mystery novel and a sick, almost perverted twist, but this attempt was such a blatant grab for attention that it drove me crazy.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|The perfect companion to any MP3 or CD player. Small size,easy to charge and greatly<br />improves the headphone output of most earbuds.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love being able to get free games l poo online and this game in particular is one of my favs
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie shows the long assembly line that your food goes through before it even reaches the supermarket. This movie should be shown in all Middle Schools, High Schools and even some college campuses to help people question what exactly are they eating. Right after I watched this movie I began researching products that I buy in order to find out what exactly I am eating.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|Tom cat is so funny.  We have so much fun using him and will continue to enjoy playing with jim
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it fun to play and the interaction with the horse is really fun. will be playing for a long bit
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I've read every Gillian Flynn book because her characters are so wonderfully complex and damaged. Sharp Objects was no different. I love a well written mystery and am usually pretty good at figuring out who done it. Sharp Objects was anything but predictable, and I was surprised at the twist and turns this novel took. A truly great read. Definitely not for those who prefer a happy ending.
1593082800|5.0|Dirty dishes in the sink, half-read books tossed aside, favorite TV programs languishing unwatched on the DVR: evidence of how far I surrendered blissfully and completely to `A Woman in White'.  The book was first written as a serial magazine story (in 1859) by Wilkie Collins a sometime collaborator with Charles Dickens. The pacing and plot architecture is superb.  For a Victorian novel it seems modern--perhaps because the author, someone I'd never heard of, lived a very flamboyant life which started out in Italy where his father had been an artist.<br />Collins first experienced Victorian England as a teen sent there to school, which seems to have allowed him to view the society as a keen participant/observer.  His characters are well-drawn and often laugh out loud funny.  One of the most interesting female characters in Victorian literature, Marian,  as well as one of the most cunning villains of all time, Count Fosco,  are to be found in this story.  The author shows us in various interesting ways how people of different sensibilities and class react to problems.  Mysteries are solved; rich villains are defeated by cleverness and persistence of middle class heroes.  It's a great story full of vivid almost cinematic scenes and engaging characters.  All of this exists in a story about stolen identity, and inheritance issues -- run of the mill themes of Victorian novels. And yet I couldn't put the book down.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I love Tommy Lee Jones, and he certainly didn't disappoint me again... I would recommend it to my family and friends
B009YQJ322|2.0|The reason I ordered this through amazon.com and not amazon.ca was the digital copy, the digital copy only works for American customers being Iam Canadian waste of money. Ifi ad been advised I who'd have bought it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a MUST read... Book two is even more amazing than book 1. This is a MUST read
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works great.... but wish I could get the flash to work too.  The Kindle was bought to do my ancestry and can't get it to work due to no flash.... Guess I should have known better.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is a MUST read... If you read 1 you have to read all. The writers way of telling the story is amazing..
1452111014|5.0|A really great insight in the art behind the movie. Great info about the complete process. Backgrounds, characters, everything is perfect
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Just as good as Name of the Wind. Leaves you wanting more at the end but satisfied with the how it wraps up. Lots of questions will need to be answered in Doors of Stone but I trust Rothfuss to make it happen.
1781164150|4.0|The book is great but the packaging was deficient and the corners of the book are all four teared. Anyway a good purchase
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I got this book as a fill in on an plane trip. It took a while to get going, but then very was very engaging.
B00AYB0SX4|5.0|This is the BEST suspense thriller I have seen in a long time. It is definitely a MUST SEE! Enjoy.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy takes a deeply scarred man who has amassed an empire partially because of his need to always be in control. This comes from being horribly scarred both mentally and physically by his trashy mom who and her. with her vulgar and abusive \\"male friends\\". By chance he meets a wonderful, smart young woman who by showing him unconditional love , saved him from the prison  he had made for himself and taught him to trust and love.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Not a fan of &#34;soppy&#34; love stories.  Characters seemed real and flawed.  This gave the book a believable quality to it.
0765325950|2.0|I had very high hopes for the conclusion to this series.  I thought Brandon had done a good job on the previous two books he'd authored in the series, and I really had faith that he would close out The Wheel of Time with authenticity.  Instead, there was very little fulfilling resolution, and the final battle felt much more like the end of his Mistborn series than anything in Jordan's realm.  The point of the Last Battle was the world that exists after the end of it.  There's nothing left to care about in that world after the abuse the series took in this installment.<br />He seemed to ignore all of the pieces that made Wheel of Time different, and focused instead on just ending the series.  There was no respect for the characters or the investment the readers had placed in those characters.  Brandon's a good writer, but his handicap in his own books has been resolving his own complicated worlds with any sense of fulfillment.<br />This was too big of a task for him, apparently, or he was rushed to completion.  Honestly, I'd rather think that this book didn't exist than consider it an actual ending to the series.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Rooting for Pat from the beginning of the book.  His journey to again find himself kept me turning the pages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Always wanted a horse now I have one. It is really good quality. All the extra ways to get coins and health is good.  I love this game. I will recommend to all my friends.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|Very soulful music. And very interesting and different. I loved it. I heard her sing on Ellen last week. Loved the entire album.
B0042ETJU2|5.0|As we all know other than the first one now of these are classic movies, but they are good and for the price you can't complain. The set I bought from region free titles worked perfect as did the special features.
B000HL09MG|3.0|I've watched Eyes Wide Shut 3 times. I am not a fan of Kubrick, nor do I care that much for Nicole Kidman and even less for Tom Cruise.<br /><br />This film is not about sex.<br /><br />Someone else on this thread mentioned it was probably a Kubrick commentary on Hollywood, which I think is true. It is about the \\"elite\\" power structure, hidden in plain sight. It is about the sacrifice of \\"lessers\\" to these \\"elites\\". People are walking around and looking right at it, with their eyes wide shut. It is hard to decipher the truth and when you think you see it, to accept.<br /><br />Otherwise I found the film lagged terribly. Just take a look at the way the masked and naked women walk around, try to walk that slowly, it's difficult to impossible. This characterizes the dreamlike quality of the film. Perhaps you are supposed to ask yourself, is this real, or a dream?<br /><br />One thing I found interesting was that when sex was offered to Harford on a platter, \\"something\\" always came up to interrupt. When He went back to try to find sex again, it wasn't available. You could understand this to mean, seize the chance when it avails itself; or perhaps that it is surely better to live with a clear conscience than to indulge in low instincts. In the end, his quasi unwilling abstinence lead perhaps to the ultimate survival of the marriage. SHE made a confession - HE made a confession and they both forgave each other. It's almost like: sex is NOT everything, even though media makes it APPEAR to be so.<br /><br />Because I think Kubrick was trying to reveal truth, I give it three stars.
B006K3796E|5.0|Purchased for a 10 year old nephew.  He loved it.<br />Very challenging.  Would recommend.<br />Like the old carnival puzzle game on steroids.
0765325950|5.0|If you got through the rest of them it is a good finish to the series. well worth the wait
B0053FANS6|5.0|Decided to upgrade to the Blu-Ray series for this trilogy. I love the first one, it had everything, action, drama, romance, suspense, comedy and the acting was great. Plus the storyline was good. The second was good too, pretty much all the same qualities as the first one. The third...there is no third movie. I'll pretend I just bought the first 2 and use the third as a paper-weight.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game. O just started playing the game and I cant stop playing it. I have my twin daughter that plays it.  A lot
B005NFJAMG|4.0|I always liked this movie. Always kept you in your seat and the acting was good. Though, when this originally came out in the theaters, I remember all the previews for it and you saw Steven Segal was in it, and I was like &#34;Oh Yeah! Cool!&#34;. Then I saw it, and was like, Oh man, he died in the first few minutes. Kind of a buzz-kill but still enjoyed it. FYI, if you like this movie, get Under Siege 2, Steven Segal is in it way more than this movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is an extremely inventive game. It offers a good challenge and has an excellent compensation program that makes this game engaging and fun.
B009MF56GC|5.0|satisfied came on time no  shipping delays video plays perfectly.It was just right for the price .look forward to making more purchases to add to the movie collection i am tying to build
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This was a great book, much more philosophical than Ender's Game.  You really need to read the author's intro to get a good sense of what the series becomes.  It is a great insight.  I really enjoyed the idea behind the speakers role and what this morphed into.  This may be my favorite of the series so far.
B003M2DWE4|5.0|We bought this for our son; who is 21 BUT a huge &#34;Lego&#34; kid back in the day - he absolutely LOVED it...
0812550706|5.0|Great book, I actually listened to it on tape but I have been engulfing the series ever since.  Has become on of my favorite series.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Slightly predictable, but enjoyable. It made me cry at times and laugh at others, a good lesson entwined for everyone.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|The app works fine just like it does on my Android phone except for the video/picture quality. For some reason I guess the application does not recognize the bigger screen size and makes the video quality high for a smaller screen but since the Fire screen is larger it stretches to fit making the quality horrible. I don't understand why if I go to YouTube and look at the same video on the artist VEVO channel it comes out in all its High Quality glory but it does not for this app. I tried deleting and re-installing the app to see if that makes a difference but it does not. It would be nice it they would recognize the problem and provide an update, or if somebody can comment with a solution to fix it rather than me just buying another device.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Excelent product. recommend this product. Excellent image quality of the video. Not regret buying it. I arrived at the agreed time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Tons is the best game I have had I love horses and my friend too. She calls them horsys. I don know how to write it but she calls them like that.
B000HL09MG|1.0|The title says it all. it was crap on top of crap...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, ever. The whole time you watch it, your waiting for something to happen, then when you think something will happen, nothing does. and for all the perves complaining about sex, go watch something else, cuz thats not what it's about...
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Fun upbeat music from a fabulous movie - Pitch Perfect! Great remixes and I love that the cast is on the soundtrack.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, and as usual I watched it on TV over the holidays and it was in color, which I thought was great.  I went from store to store in hopes of buying this DVD, in color, as a gift for my grandchildren, but was unable to find one.  Then I saw it on Amazon and the picture on the cover of the DVD is in color so I assumed the movie was in color also, but to my disappointment it was the old black and white version.  If the cover picture of the movie had been in black and white, I would not have bought it,  I think it was false advertisement.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I liked the idea of this book and I'm really interested in stories that will 'lift my spirits'. This book was close to those themes but shied away from it through predictability. As soon as I read the 1st chapter, I knew where this book was going and how it was going to get there. I chose this book because Albom had written that nice book - Tuesdays with Morrie. I LOVED that book and it really helped me think about the things that were important in my life. This book missed the mark for me. But still cute...just a little too cheesy.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly, although it has some parts past the middle where the narrative slows down a little too much for my taste, this book is fast paced and keeps you entertained, I was afraid of the ending, as it is my humble opinion that mr King's endings are not his strongest points, however this is not the case with this book, I highly recommend it to any fiction reader.
B0038P59A0|5.0|If you like suspense and mystery, then this is the movie for you. Great acting and the special effects made the whole movie fun and exciting to watch.  Can't wait to see the next one.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|sometimes you get the feeling that quality is substituted with confusion and as long as your confused it is a success.<br />Liam is OK and the action keeps coming enough to engage us. 4 stars might be pushing it but you'll see why at the end.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|...... Since her audition on Britain's Got Talent, and in such a short time! I think this is my favorite CD so far. I STILL go look at her audition video,because it makes me smile to realize if you have a dream, it is never too late to make it happen. Her voice is truly a gift to the ear.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Having the Weather Channel on my Kindle is wonderful.  I can get the current, hourly, 36 hour,  and 10 day weather immediately which is great.  I can also change locations, get maps, video, severe weather warnings,  and seasonal alerts.
B0098460O4|5.0|When these two open their mouths to sing,I think heaven becomes quiet. Surely they have both been given amazing talent,and a friendship that I hope lasts forever wherever their talents  take them. Charlotte has a voice clear as a bell, and truly does complement Jonathan's. Jonathan is truly amazing for one so young,and I am happy that he has an appreciation for  all kinds of music, although he should honor his talen't and I hope stays with opera. I must watch the audition video and the others of them several times a week, so I was thrilled to order their first CD. I truly enjoy listening to it, and each time it is played,find something new to love about it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is great.  I really like it because it is so easy to use and it is on my 7 inch Kindle which makes it very easy to see!
B00063EMJG|1.0|Don't get me wrong... I love Neil Young... but, this CD is full of really low quality recordings. Not worth purchasing... promise.
B000001F45|5.0|I am, and always will be a huge fan of Uriah Heep and all of it's members. I saw this band live 3 times during the hight of their popularity. They were as good live as they were in the studio. Every single one of their albums is a gem. They are one of the overlooked Giants of that time in music history. Every bit as good as: Zepplin, Sabbath, Deep Purple etc. etc. etc.!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love this game, I started playing this before I got into the original. The graphics are better. The visuals are great, its bright wheras the original was dark......at least as far as I got on the original. I just don't like how the gems are few and far between given the higher the levels, the quicker the obstacles come.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I had read it three times and still couldn't stop reading it. Such a good book. I wish there was a fourth.
0470474874|5.0|Muy completo, con explicaciones y ejemplos muy claros.  El contenido del CD es sumamente adecuado.  No domino el idioma inglés, no obstante puedo comprender y resolver los ejercicios allí planteados.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a great way to end this trilogy. It was filled with great emotion and many surprises. I really wish there was another book after this one.
B001EN71CW|5.0|There's really nothing more to say. It's Firefly. It's on blu ray. As a Firefly fan, (browncoat), it's awesome to see it on blu-ray!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is SUPERGREAT !!! One of the best series on TV. Thank goodness Amazon was here so I could catch all the past shows.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Shipped on time, and my daughter, who sings, has listened to it quite a bit.  Love the modern redux of the cellblock tango!
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I was wonderfully surprised at this series.  I never watched the original so I didn't know what to expect.  Artfully done.
B00377V6J2|5.0|If you like blues you will like this.<br />High energy with combustion!<br />Parcel arrived on time and in great conditon.
B002RI9MWA|4.0|Having just returned from India, I read this on the plane on the way  home and thoroughly enjoyed the internal conflict the main character  presented.  A good read!
965006026X|5.0|Regardless of your views on Keynesian economics, this edition is well produced and easy to read. High quality paper, large text, solid binding.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|BBT is the smartest comedy on TV. Both the actors and writers have developed a perfect match. It just gets funnier and funnier as they all grow.
B006RBZV82|3.0|Beautiful visuals and interesting facts, however the narration performed seemed sub par and over dramatic. The writing brings up some interesting facts as I said earlier, but it straddles the fence of pandering.
B00684J49U|5.0|Season Eight like all the others brings you on a roller coaster ride of emotions, filled with laughs, tears, and more laughs. If you're a true fan of the show, then you need to add this to your collection.
B00499DRJO|5.0|Belief is at the core of this.  This book reaches every dimension of energy healing. Mind. Body. Genetics. Beliefs. Spirit. Soul. Past and Future. All I want to do now is practice, practice, practice.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Being a fan of Elaine Paige, I had to have this album.  I was not disappointed!  I'd love to hear more renditions from the great Andrew Lloyd Webber productions.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|After 26 years of the short movie, Tim Burton brings us a movie with his name written all over it. Creative and original, Frankeweenie illustrates its writer's original roots.<br /><br />The concept is fascinating. Most of the characters are based on iconic horror movie characters, like Frankenstein and Van Helsing. In addition, the movie is set in black and white, trying to capture the old look of horror movies. And yes, I don't think this film is suitable for children, more like teenagers and adults, containing some scenes that may disturb children.<br /><br />It's the story of Victor Frankenstein (voiced by Charlie Tahan), who, after losing his beloved dog Sparky, tries to revive him using lightning. The experiment is a success, but no one should know about what happened. Things start to get messed up when Edgar (voiced by Atticus Shaffer) discovers Sparky.<br /><br />The animation is great. Tim Burton brings us a stop-motion masterpiece, paying attention to every detail from the movie's beginning to its end. The decent overall voice performance does the job just fine, giving us spooky character, Atticus Shaffer's voice gave me the chills. Tim Burton's fine job and the voice actors' performance give us the horror atmosphere necessary for the movie.<br /><br />Burton is always highly imaginative and creative, but he's somehow missing something. Don't get me wrong, the movie's great, but something would've made it better. Frankenweenie will entertain a good percentage of its watchers, making it a must see 2012 movie.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|The characters are very well rounded and interesting. They develop at a nice pace. I recommend this show to anyone who likes &#34;possibilities&#34; in what could happen. But, not likely to happen.
B007P6VM04|5.0|I love this album and if you are a fan of Smash, you'll want to purchase this album while it s still available.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|It is a look at the effects of schrizophnia and how it impacts all the lives around it. It also shows a triumph over mental illiness.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was interesting to see how some teenagers think and react to things in their lives. I would recommend this to high school readers.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Great fun and extremely funny. I have to admit I purchased this one on a whim and I am so glad I did!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you think this game is going to be rubbish it sooooo wrong it is so cool  you can have so many characters and power up download this game and then you will know what I am on about
B004SIP98S|5.0|Well acted and is a piece of current historical events. It is a movie about an event that all remember.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|It was good but not the quality of Band of Brothers.  Spent a lot of time on life at home and not as much on the Pacific Theater.<br />Close but no cigar.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Subpurb acting! This movie highlights how small changes can change a person's and a nation's history. Colin Firth and the rest of this cast is amazing.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book I couldn't put down in two days i was done with it, just like that bit I wish there was another book!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|My son-in- law is a baseball buff. he loves watching this movie over and over. I love a good gift and this is one!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|As good as  the show leads you to believe it is and takes you behind the scenes with Kate and Rick
B003UESJF6|5.0|I wish you could watch my 2-year old granddaughter sing &#34;bad to the bone&#34; and throughly enjoy her dvd of megamind!
B001NOQI3U|2.0|It looked like it might have been a fine film to watch, but I gave up after 30 minutes of trying to get the streaming video to work.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app. is awesome. works great.everyone. should get this alarm clock. the best thing is it is free. get it now
B0095P33IW|4.0|Captain America: the First Avenger was entertaining from start to finish.  The good guys triumph over evil, there is a lot of action and a great set up for the follow on movie The Avengers due to several direct links to future actions and characters in the Avengers.  Best of all the streaming video played perfectly on this one – so hopefully Amazon is improving the service.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|One of the best paid apps I've seen.  It has surprisingly well thought out strategic gameplay, and the developer is releasing new content that you get at no cost if you beat the game on its hardest difficulty.  Definitely worth the 99 cents.
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|Loved this show so much that we watched all of the seasons twice!  The only problem with the show is that there were not more seasons!
B007SGM084|5.0|If neglect all that kinky sex story, this is one of the most exciting and most twisted in every single chapters.
B00821PCJS|4.0|Well crafted with a good story line and continuity between episodes.  Highly recommend!  Good action and mild language.  Something the whole family can watch.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Lot's of great fun...beautiful graphics. I adore my horse. I get all the satisfaction of caring for my baby, without the backache.
B007N85POS|5.0|This was the first Amazon download after I got my Kindle.  She likes it because she is saving the birds.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I thought this game was very interesting. There were not a lot of hidden object scenes (which I liked) but it was just enough. I don't think it was worth $4.99 because its only about 3-4 hours of play but I enjoyed it anyway.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My 7 yr old likes the show and likes this also because you have to try and defeat the evil scientist.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome book to sum everything up. I Love this trilogy. Best I have ever read so far. I would read it again.
B004FGMV0W|5.0|Excellent.I love this CD.It met my expectation.I could not have wished for anything more or less.Keep up the good work.
0199236178|3.0|The explanations are pretty good. However they are a bit lacking for some fundamental and difficult concepts such as constructing MO theory orbitals and how it is done. The first chapter is rather dry and easy to just skip, but should just be review from lower level chemistry courses. I will try to update this review as I follow the book through the class. Thankfully my professor is amazing.<br /><br />Edit: Further in the semester and decreasing the score from a 4 to a 3. The book barely touches on hard/soft acid/base chemistry which is a huge topic for predicting reactions. Some theoretical topics are covered in great detail, but are wholly useless for the level this book is written at. They explain lattices to great detail but lack sufficient explanation for all the ways Born-Haber cycles can be used. Equations aren't always presented well (not in their own paragraph) which makes reading difficult. Example problems aren't well explained. Basically, the book covers information very well, but it doesn't cover the information it needs to cover for a course well enough.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Excellent.I love this CD.It met my expectation.I could not have wished for anything more or less.Keep up the good work.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Compact, works well. Made my blade very sharp. The three different sharpening points were really good. If you're not obnoxiously serious about sharpening your knives, then this is a good choice for pretty much everyone.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Excellent.I love this CD.It met my expectation.I could not have wished for anything more or less.Keep up the good work.
B0018GRAE4|5.0|I hear &#34;Salvation&#34; somewhere and decided to check this band out. They're awesome! I've seen them live and they're just as good. Not their strongest album in my opinion but they're all good so far. This one got me into the band. If you're checking them out I suggest you go with American Capitalist first. But if you already like the band then you need this album.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Excellent.I love this CD.It met my expectation.I could not have wished for anything more or less.Keep up the good work.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I enjoy watching this.  It's very entertaining and I like watching it one right after the other.  Last episode left me feeling like the show was on the verge of changing direction, I hope it's just as entertaining.
B000002IP1|5.0|Excellent.I love this CD.It met my expectation.I could not have wished for anything more or less.Keep up the good work.
B007PVHANM|5.0|This was accidentally erased from my DVR from when it aired on television.  I HAD to ensure that it was always available for me and my children because Mr. Marley is such an AWESOME figure in the history of this world, in my opinion...  I believe this captures him in a beautiful and inspirational way.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this series.....I can't put the series down. It's very captivating and u can't wait to see what happens next!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I would have given my liver to see this concert live. But, this will have to do. These guys still rock. It took Robert a few songs to get his voice warmed up, but he hit all of the important notes. Jimmy can still play. John Paul Jones is probably the best all around musician and was incredible. Jason Bonham didn't miss a beat. I've seen him a few times, and the kid can play. I don't think anyone else could have filled those shoes.<br /><br />The bonus disc has rehearsal footage which is like seeing another performance entirely. I actually like some of the rehearsal versions better than the live concert version. (Since I've Been Loving You). It's just not as polished visually as the main concert footage. But, if you are a Zeppelin fan, this is a must see.
B00AMZNQS6|4.0|I was interested in this set as I have individual Bruckner symphonies by Klemperer--the fourth and sixth and those whetted the appetite for the fifth and eighth.  While i much enjoyed the performances of the fourth, sixth and seventh symphonies in this set, i found the fifth and eighth lacking momentum to the point of being inert.  I like the monumental approach to Bruckner as much as anyone but Klemp was off his game in those two symphonies, and only so-so in the ninth.  The music feels lifeless to me.  Beware, the eighth has a gigantic cut in the finale--very jarring.  I prefer the slower approach to the eighth scherzo, for example like Wand in his recordings.  But almost 20 minutes?--to me it crawled along.  So i give five stars to 4, 6 and 7, but only three to the other three.
1451613512|5.0|This was a gift for someone who has a PhD in US history. He was totally surprised and amazed, as he had no idea that Oliver Stone had written such a book. He is eagerly looking forward to the read, although the length is a consideration.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|Have to have all the newly released beatles albums.  This one did not disappoint.  I have a few more to order to complete the set.
0345803493|2.0|Although I was pretty entertained with the first part I found this part very boring and could hardly finish it. The author got a little better with words and is not repeating everything over and over but still- very boring to me. I do not buy the last part as I am afraid I will fall asleep. This might just be a book for a Teenager...
B0035LJF2U|4.0|Watching this video brought back some really good memories. I was at the concert at Sun Devil Stadium where this film was shot. The crispness of the cold desert night, the amazingly large light trusses surrounding the stage, Louma cranes in front of and behind the stage. Camera helicopter buzzing the stadium in slow circles....amazing light show.<br /><br />It's all here. Directed by Spielberg acolyte Phil Joanou, this film captures the electric dynamic that U2 is able to establish with its audience during its on-stage performance as well as some cut-in 'behind-the-scenes' footage depicting the band in everyday situations. This is some of the best concert footage ever shot IMHO (and I've seen Led Zeppelin's 'The Song Remains the Same' movie many times, as well as Pink Floyd, etc.).<br /><br />Some good behind the scenes footage with B.B. King rehearsing &#34;When Love Comes to Town&#34;. This film is a wonderful chronicle of their epic &#34;Joshua Tree&#34; tour, perhaps the pinnacle of their creativity and success IMO, and there's some other songs in here from &#34;War&#34;. A couple of hours well spent. Just turn up your home theater, turn out the lights and get your favorite mood altering substance queued up, 'cause you're in for a treat.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you don't love this show just go ahead and turn in your geek card.  I am serious, the cancellation of this show could be argued as the begin of the downfall of television as we know it.  One day you will be able to tell your kids that you actually saw great TV.  One day...
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty good and I like it's look but I don't like<br />the energy and gems to get anything good. I wish it was easier to get gems
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Calling all nerds and nerdettes-  if you didn't get enough of the great series &#34;Firefly&#34; then you need to see this film.  The blue ray is breathtaking.  The story is fun and well written.  The effects are cool.  The ship is a masterpiece.
B000002N3N|4.0|Over the past twenty-odd years, Enya Brennan has become known worldwide for her layered vocals and delicate instrumentation, in many ways defining New Age music. But for her to have essentially taken the crown of this genre implies a depth to her music, and this is very evident on \\"The Memory of Trees\\".<br /><br />Enya's first few albums were good, but there was something missing, something that had yet to be developed. I'm not entirely sure what that intangible \\"something\\" was, but she certainly found it on this one. The title track is an instrumental masterpiece featuring her trademark layered vocals (though no lyrics to speak of), and it reminds on of a clear fall day. This sets the pace for the record, which is decidedly autumnal. 'Anywhere Is' is about the maze that life's choices put us into, while 'Pax Deorum' features few lyrics (all in Latin) that reverberate almost like a dark stormy night that eventually settles into a calm drizzle. 'Once You had Gold' is as delicate as a falling leaf, and 'On My Way Home' brings back memories of weekend trips home from college, traveling through the gorgeous foliage and dizzying scents of fall.<br /><br />If 'Only Time' defined her \\"A Day without Rain\\" album, it's 'China Roses' that defines \\"The Memory of Trees\\". Enya has crafted a lullaby-like soothing piece of moonlight that is instantly calming. It's easily the best piece of the record and, even nearly twenty years after the album's release, it still stands firmly, refusing to sound dated in a genre that, at one point, relied a little too much on synthesizers.<br /><br />It's been over fifteen years since \\"The Memory of Trees\\" was released, but it's a still favorite when it comes to Enya's music. As another reviewer said, you can't go wrong with this artist, but this album is definitely one of her best.
0307887448|3.0|I love this book for the same reason the other 5 star reviewers did: the basic premise, the 1980s references, video game nostalgia, and Dungeons & Dragons.<br /><br />I hate this book for the same reason the other 1-star reviewers did: WAY too much boring exposition, and too heavy a reliance on 80s-reference dropping.<br /><br />But I thoroughly enjoyed the final 25% of the book, and when I read the last line, I nodded approvingly. It was indeed a good story with a lot of heart, despite it's flaws. But it needs to go on a diet and cut some of the excess fat! If you love the 1980s, video games, and Dungeons & Dragons, definitely read this book. If you don't, you'll probably be bored.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My 8 year old grandson wanted this movie and I stayed with them for a week and we watched it everyday,  Great movie.
1616550414|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the series from Ocarina of Time on. This book is amazing, from the timeline to the illustrated drawings.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|Gaiman's talent for working with mythological themes in a modern setting is on display here.  Like several others in this vein, such as Anansi Boys and Neverwhere, he delivers engaging characters, an intriguing take on the mythological themes, and a nice twist at the climax.  Far from a masterpiece, it sags in places and leaves some threads loose in the end, but it also delivers satisfying treats along the way.  While it stays on the surface, it does not neglect to point toward some deeper questions.  All in all a pleasant and memorable read.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|I always worry about the longevity of a series over time and if it can sustain its primary objective: making it fun to watch without overburdening it with plot and trying too hard. Do the actors still have chemistry and does the plot keep your eyes glued, no matter what? Needless to say, the last MIB wasn't that great, adding too much and too many new characters so I was hesitant to watch this one.<br /><br />In MIB3, what is pretty much a franchise re-boot, they went back to basics and kept it between K and J about their unique interaction. Smith and Jones have not lost their edge. This time 'round, it's time travel and visiting a young K and stopping an invasion...again.<br /><br />There's really nothing to dislike. Honestly. The plot was well written and tight. There was a surprising level of depth I really didn't expect but this franchise has always managed to have enough of it without getting mushy. No answers left unanswered. You learn a few more interesting things about the mysterious K. It had cool gadgets, a few alien ick factors and it didn't try to do too much. It's over the top enough with the ET element and it was nice to have a throwback, where the tech isn't so in your face. No part was hokey, it was tongue-in-cheek and fresh.<br /><br />James Brolin was the PERFECT young K. I mean, he really looks like he could have been Tommy Lee Jones' son in real life. He got Jones' mannerisms, chemistry, just everything down pat. Smith and Jones themselves, well, unsurprisingly they did awesome and I can't wait for the next MIB!
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Vonnegut once seemed a revelation - now his work is just interesting.  Billy Pilgrim gets lost in this quintessential Vonnegut story, trying to make sense of the irrational and the horrific.  The contrast between crazy (as in psychotic) war and banal (as in stultifying) life at home is too much for the poor man's mind, and he wanders through time and place.<br /><br />If you want to understand what makes Vonnegut a cult hero, and what makes Vonnegut worth the read, this is a good place to start.  You will meet strange creatures, and wonder what side they are on.  You will meet two dimensional characters, and wonder how they capture so many sides of us.  You will be disoriented.  You will be surprised.  You will be dismayingly unsurprised.  People will die horribly, and you will find yourself smiling ironically.  And so it goes.
B001HN6922|5.0|Kids Love It!! Product arrived in a timely manner. Have seen it now about 300 times more than I would have liked too, but it's all good.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|Well, okay, I am a lifelong fan of Leonard Cohen  And this is not his best work, but it is still mighty good.  From the &#34;broken banjo bobbin' on a dark-infested sea&#34; to the enigmatic &#34;Show me the place,&#34; this continues his long groove of putting multi-faceted symbolism together with meditative music. At times you almost resent his musical talent for pulling you into his strange and gnarly conceptual paradoxes, but they work their way under your skin and you find yourself grateful - just grateful.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|I love this movie. Very intense with a lot of flashy action scenes and a nice plot. Wish there were more just like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A good enough story, with an interesting setting and some nice twists along the way.  It will be remembered for turning a teen-age girl's romantic angst into a symbol of the abuse that tyranny puts people through, and the subtext about reality shows has a wicked bite.  Still, in the end you are supposed to find makeovers interesting, and that's only the most obvious way that our narcissistic side gets an implicit nod of approval from this book that might have challenged our assumptions.  No doubt it deserves the enormous audience it gathered, but for middle-aged folk like me it remains a view into their world, not a revelation of ours.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|good ole heart warming movie..love clint eastwood  and amy and justin were good too. always like a good love interest
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Lewis is not always &#34;spot on&#34;, but he has a gift for putting the human side of Wall Street on display.  This is not about the cocaine-fueled flight from reality that led us to the crisis, and it doesn't really explain the world of CDOs and credit default swaps, but he can give a feeling for them to the layman (I think - once you have wrapped your head around them, it is hard to evaluate an explanation for clarity to outsiders).  Instead, from the perspective of a few analysts and traders who were finding the impending crisis to be a sure-fire winning bet, only to be greeted with unbelief by the herd, it puts on display the banality of a whole class of self-important, self-congratulatory and self-deluded Wreckers of the Universe, in what might be an extended epilogue to Tom Wolfe's insightful &#34;Bonfire of the Vanities&#34;.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|I do not normally like these kind of shows, but this show is excellent. Season two is even better than the first. Excellent drama.
B009B0L324|5.0|The ACDC Live album has been one of my favorite cds of all time.  When I saw River Plate I was hesitant that ACDC could sound as good as they did in the 80s.  After the first song I realized my fears were unjustified....ACDC can still rock.  As a grown man in his 40s I can not remember the last time I rolled down my car windows and cranked up a cd just to listen to the music and to feel alive but the River Plate cd did just that.  Yes the classics are accounted for The Jack, Highway to Hell, Shook Me All Night Long, but the newer songs were just as good Big Jack and Black Ice were two of my favorites.  Wheter you are a ACDC fan or just a fan of old school Rock N Roll you will not be disappointed in this cd.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|I have gotten many years of enjoyment from this movie.  Before I had purchased it, I had seen it 72 times already.  One of my all time favorite movies!
6304698623|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie as a kid and I was exstatic to find it on DVD. It was a great addition to my collection.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife is a large knife but it really is a great survival knife that will last though any kind of beating you are going put it though a must have
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I just love the series and I just loved the set being all in one case. I don't have to go look for all the separate movies.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Much better than I ever expected. Can't wait to read second book.  I could not put it down.  Loved it
0143117009|4.0|I bought this product for school. I liked this product, it was shipped quickly and was exactly how it was described in the description.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series if full of intrigue. There are many sub plots for the many different groups of characters. I can't wait until the next episode to see what new twist the plot will take.
0345803493|5.0|I am in the middle of this book and it is pretty good.  I loved the first one and this one is good but kind of slow to me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LOVE the nice variety of games!! I think it's so cool! I play it when I'm bored, or have nothing to do. Good for passing time. I LOVE THIS APP SO MUCH!!!!!!!! This app might be a little hard for little kids, but good for<br />kids ages 6 - 12. This app keeps me entertained for thirty minutes. Great app!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I loved this game!!  It was great! I definintly recommend it! :) I played through it twice. Five stars to this little game!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is AMAZING!! U should SO get it! It's just one of those apps that never gets boring. This app entertains me for a whole hour! This<br />app is the only app in the WORLD that entertains me for that long! This app is ( like I said before ) AMAZING!! I repeat AMAZING!! In the past, I<br />Recommended ( in my mind) this app to temple run lovers. Now days, I recommend this app to... EVERYONE!! For those of you who buy this<br />app, have fun with it!!<br />P.S.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read all 3 and couldn't put them down... This is a truly amazing story! Can't recommend this series enough!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is pretty cool. Hoverboards are awesome. Characters are<br />cool. Keeps me busy for about 25 minutes. Nice app to play if you're<br />looking for something to do.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use! love this app! even my ten year old can use it! very helpful on a weekly basis.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I LOVE this game! Really fun! This game was one of the first apps i<br />got. This game is the original angry birds game, but it's still pretty fun. Tons of level options! AMAZED!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Been a Doctor Who fan since college, love the revamped series. Happily raising a house full of new Doctor fans with the help of Amazon Prime!
1449410243|4.0|Is your cat quietly resting, or waiting for the perfect time to kill you? In this hilarious take on feline inner dialogue, they will help you determine what your cat is really thinking. A fun read for any cat owner. I purchased this as a gift for a coworker, who gave it a very positive review. She said it was &#34;Purrrrfect&#34;. The removable centerfold is a funny poster that recaps the basics of the book.
0547260695|5.0|I was very impressed with this book it far exceeded my expectations. My toddler how ever will have to wait a couple of years before she can play with it.
B002R5LKOQ|4.0|enjoyed the movie otherwise. Acting was excellent. Great action and suspense. But could do without the foul language. I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids told me i should try this game, ( it's awesome daddy!) is what they told me, i have to pay attention to the clock so as not to get too lost in the game, 30 minutes playing this game feels like 5! Enjoy!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Why do British productions and actors seem to be so  much better than Americans?  Or is it just me enjoying this as being nearly perfect entertainment.  I'm almost obsessed with this series, as are a lot of us these days, and i can't recommend it enough.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Inspirational story and good insite on recipes for running. It was a little too short though and I would of liked to hear more about the western states
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book. I read the first one and couldn't wait to get the next one. It did not disappoint!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fantastic read. loved it loved it and loved it....... I cant wait to read the other 2 books and for the movie to come out
B0033H7VI6|5.0|For anyone who is thinking about buying this knife, this is an amazing knife. I would recomend this knife to anyone. This knife feels like a 100 dollar knife for a low price. Honestly the only bad thing this knife has is the sheathe. But, the sheathe is functional. Buy this knife because you wont regret it.
1419701533|5.0|Books were in great condition and arrived on time. My 8 year old son loves these books and is already in the middle of book 2. Proud parent &#60;3.
0316113506|5.0|Ratey should be required reading for anyone needing evidence to support their impulse to restore phys ed programs in our schools. It was long thought that endorphins were the neurochemical that gave runner's high; turns out it's a different receptor (Cannabinoid) and a different chemical (anandamide). Same as THC, but of course you have to run to get it.<br /><br />This is just the beginning of the benefits of exercise. BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) is generated by muscle exercise, then travels to the brain where it prompts growth of neurons! Benefits are also cited in combating addiction (Odyssey House and Dance Dance Revolution), improving learning in Chicago high school students, how to beat the maze rats in your old age, and much more. Buy it or be square!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really enjoy reading Gillian Flynn. This book took me a little longer to get into but it is definitely worth the read! I can't wait to read gone girl now!
B00003CXPD|1.0|The movie was great but the quality of product was poor and unsatisfactory.  Both films were new and unopened but still one copy did not play correctly.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Very entertaining, another great movie with Denzel Washington. He plays the role so well about a man with problems. A must see
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it and its almost like mario. It has good quality. I bet the second is better. Its awesome!
B002N2LEVM|5.0|I wish there were more seasons. I absolutely loved this show.It's inspiring me to watch anything Joss Whedon has done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It was my firsts time reading Stephen King, it was for a book club. I had always heard how brilliant this author is, well I can finally see what everybody was talking about. I loved it and hopefully I can read other book by this author soon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had heard about this from numerous friends and reviews in magazines. I was a bit worried since it's young adult, and also knowing that it would be a sad story. I really enjoyed this book and will be reading more by John Green.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love the book it was totally five stars. I'm a hopeless romantic but this book is anything but hopeless!!!!
B008FSCNTK|4.0|I am a long time Krall fan... and have seen her live as well. She's fabulous. This is a definitely departure for her but one I like a great deal.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|This game must have been developed solely for the purposes of advertising. It advertises at the beginning, in between levels, it actually takes breaks to show you an advertisement.<br />The game itself is incredibly simple, and nothing like the challenge of the Mario game it is based off of. The only reason I ever died, is because of the horrible controls. It's just nowhere close to being as accurate and responsive as it needs to be. It gets so frustrating that you won't trust yourself when jumping, as to where you'll actually land. It makes you appreciate how well the controls worked in the original Mario.<br />Theirs no boss at the end of the dungeons, you just walk off screen.  Sad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! The devotions give you a sense of discipline and they are good. The features are great too (I.e. daily reminders, calendar view yo see missed days, etc)
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This is one of those games that makes you want to restart, and restart levels until you get a perfect score on them. It's addictive, but not to the point that you can't set it down, and come back to it. Whimsical background music. I got it as the free app of the day, but I would be happy with it if I paid for it.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|This is a great movie.  Good learning experience.  I enjoyed the HBO movie Tuskegee Airmen and this one is equal to that.
B001C08RHA|5.0|It's an amazing movie and I love every bit of it! I've watched it so many times with my family. Thanks!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It's one of the best books I've ever read. I finished it yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it. I may even read it again tomorrow it's that good. I've never reread a book in my life. I highly recommend Hopeless!
B003FXXNH6|4.0|Great action movie, the acting was fair and I would recommend it to any martial artist. Thanks a lot !
B00B7FXYJG|4.0|Badass but the second half of the movie was a bit slow compared to the first half. Worth watching for any batman fan.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Brilliant acting, a compelling story, and human characters. What could one want more? I highly recommend this for anyone who appreciates film.
B008Y6TD5A|3.0|I liked the premise of the movie, and I thought the actors did a fine job, it just really dragged in places.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book starts goes like crazy and ends only as it can. Collins does a great job closing out the trilogy.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun and addictive. It is so challengng to solve each game until I get the perfect score and earn a hint<br />coin. The obstacles are interesting and the variety of games is intriguing.
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|When i first tried this and I saw the items I was like, YES!!!!! , and then IT ENDED. This would be soo much better if there was more time!!!!!!!!
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have always been a big fan of John Grisham..The Litigators was funny and interesting and moved along so quickly that I was slow to read the end..Great book
B007TXN4TK|5.0|wonderful app to learn to play some songs - and love the feature that u can just listen to the melody
B00319ECGK|4.0|I bought this expecting great things from the sound. Wildly flung about was the sound in the lobby scene on Blu Ray. Hyped up expectations ruined it for me. This was not as good as I was expecting sound wise.<br />Picture quality as to be expected from Blu Ray.<br />If you like the Matrix buy this, if your wanting reference level sound go somewhere else.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was one of the best books I have ever read. I thoroughly enjoyed the real life situations displayed in the story and the life lessons for all people to learn.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had no idea how hooked I would get on this series!  The acting is superb, great plots and scenery, love everything about this show!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|I purchased this as a Christmas gift and this was reasonably priced and there my daughter was happy with this purchase.
B00B01XDTI|3.0|Great attempt.  The story moved way to slowly.  I found myself dozing off a couple of times.  The first one was way better in my opinion.  If anything Sean Bean made for some good eye candy.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|Ordered this as a christmas present and my daughter loved it.  I purchase it at a reasonable price and am please with my purchase.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Probably like many, saw the movie and enjoyed it.  I decided to check out some of the books.  I'm enjoying this one and expect to seek out more.  I received my kindle fire as Christmas present.  I wasn't sure I would like the digital format - I like getting a real newspaper, but you can't beat the convenience.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I liked the app a lot but it wasn't as good as the original version the challenges are a medium
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Perfect way to catch up on the greatest series!  This is worth every bit of your time - my husband even watches with me, he was hooked after the first episode.
0765325950|5.0|Most of it reads like Jordan wrote it. Great to see all the characters involved and the little bits of action they all get.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Have had this game for a couple of months now and love it... a must have for KF users.<br />Challenging and fun!!! Eveyone seems to like the same things about it that drew me to it... the artwork is especially nice and the music evokes a real dreamlike feel. Gameplay is smooth and responsive and difficulty curve is spot on. Tough but NEVER frustrating.<br />Also, the folks at 11bit have been good about updates and have provided new levels often enough to keep the game fresh. Once you finish the game you will probably go back and try for gold on all levels.<br />If you like puzzlers with some platform action for good measure, do yourself a favor and pick this one up NOW:)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The new temple run is fun and cool I enjoy it and I love it because you cAn do lots for stuff with the new temple run.
B007712XAU|5.0|Downton Abbey - Seasons 1 and 2 - It is a wonderful series and worth the time and resources to view and anxious to see Season 3
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Please get this game it is so fun and addicting totally worth your time....I LOVE this GAME !!!!!!!!!!!!! Get it
B008OOYALE|4.0|I need to erase this game but it saves even without the game. HOW CAN IT DO THAT!??!!!? Ok anyway this game is fun and when I started I couldn't put it down. And by the time I did, about ten hours had passed and I was at level ten. I just really want to use my gold wisely this time I will edit when I find the solution..<br /><br />Ok I seriously don't get it. One I REALLY want to restart and two, I can't seem to get enough food! I will 're
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was so good!!!!!!!!!!!:)  I thought it was so so SO funny At first when I first started reading I did not really enjoy it so I was like great I just wasted $8!!! But I kept reading and it started to get good so I kept reading  it now I'm thankful I read it!!!!!!!!!!!  ;  )
B0050DIWFC|5.0|would love to see a movie made.  story was amazing  mr landay did a great job.<br />will look for more of his novels
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good<br /> G as me I . Like game g a me I s good I . Really like k we lots
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a really good a fun game, it seems so realistic!  It shows you how to really take care of horses and it passes time
B001J29H9I|5.0|By far my favorite album by The Black Keys. Classic blues remade by a modern blues band. Very fitting for a cover album
B00821OX98|3.0|I watch it because there is not much Sci Fi available. Generally weak plots. Not much left to the imagination.
B0011ZVVOM|4.0|I could listen to this guitar tone all day. Dirty, modern blues that I had been looking for until I discovered this band recently. Didnt pay too much attention to their radio hits but upon further review, I love the Black Keys and this is my second favorite album behind Chulahoma
B0034G4OYK|4.0|Sony Animation forces you to use Netflix to get the Ultraviolet (Digital) copy of the movie.<br /><br />It's easy enough, just a hassle when the rest of the planet uses iTunes.
B0093X805W|5.0|The charlie and the chocolate factory movie with johnny dep isn't like the book at all. the first movie has gene wilder is true
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I did not know the story and knew that the book had been out for a while.<br />Thought I might find it interesting. The movie seemed to disappear and I<br />wondered why.  Now I know.
B0091REZMW|4.0|good game but needs a little work. just started playing so we will see how it goes. graphics could be a little better and it could be a little harder.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has everything I need for any type of calculating I need to do!! Very helpful and very easy to use!! :)
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Anna Kendrick is perfect in the movie. Just fun and easy to watch. Highly recommended as a date movie and when you're just looking for something fun to watch.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run.  It's challenging and almost addictive not to mention the fun.  I can hardly put it down.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am addicted to this series, very well done and entertaining.  Love it! Very excited that season 4 in now in production.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I like that it had hidden objects with a mystery!  Hours of fun!  I hope I can find similar games!  Let download another one!
B008133MDK|5.0|Am interesting update to the Conan Doyle classics. The leads are great... And the best Mrs Hudson ...A future classic
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Love it ! It's what a match three game should be . It's way more fun than Bejeweled. If you've played Two and was disappointed in the graphics then you'll love this one.
B009738XXM|5.0|Many of her songs are on my workout play list. So up beat and fun to listen too. It's great.
0618526412|3.0|This book is certainly worth reading, but it is limited in that it covers a particular place and time (the U.S. South in the years just before WW II) and presents stereotypical  and unrealistic characters and situations. There is no sense of hope and no recognition that the South and political and social situations will change.<br /><br />The story centers around a set of characters. Two, Singer and Antonapoulos, are deaf mutes but opposite in character. Antonapoulos is self centered and greedy, while Singer is attentive to the needs of others. Why Singer has such a strong feeling for his friend is hard to see.  Dr. Copeland, a \\"Negro\\" medical doctor and his family make up another stereotype. The doctor is well educated and speaks in perfect English, but his family members are all poorly educated and use poor English. It is hard to believe that such a situation would occur. Moreover Dr. Copeland is an advocate for the advancement of his race, another stereotype.  Mick Kelly and her family make up another group of characters. Mick is 12 at the start of the book but is wise beyond her years. She acts, however, in strange ways.  Biff Brannon is the owner of a cafe and also has some strange behaviors. For one he becomes attracted to Mick in an unhealthy way after the death of his wife, but in the end nothing comes of it. Finally, there is Jack Blount, a radical communist who is constantly drunk.<br /><br />A series of negative events occur in the book and then it comes to an inconclusive end. It is worth reading as a period piece and for the characterization, but it is not a lasting piece of literature.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson is a unique talent but he's running out of narrative ideas.  As usual, his sets, locations, and costumes immerse you in a very specific time and place.  This time, however, the script itself lacks emotional nuances and resonance of this boy and girl that the visual details only partially compensate for.  It's well worth renting but not owning because you absorb it all the first viewing.
0811879542|5.0|I bought this for my friends 5 year old and he loves it.  My friend loves it too. i i
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I hate this show because they slowly build up this world that you slowly fall in love with. They introduce you to all these interesting characters and then leave you hanging.  They make a teaser movie called Serenity and leave you even more hanging!  Nerd Rage!!!!!  Season 2?!?!?!?!? #zomg #companionlove #dundundunnnn #anara #firefly #serenity #reaverrarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
B0087HT36U|4.0|I really enjoy this game, but my quest for completion looks like it isn't going to happen. Several levels don't seem to be able to be completed (or gold-crowned). Lev 2-28, as mentioned. And 2 treasure levels don't work either.<br /><br />1) Age of Discovery Treasure 3, I've thrown that fire everywhere, including the spot posted in solution videos. Doesn't work.<br />2) Age of Discovery Treasure 4, same problem as 2-28 (the delay on firing your first shot). And the guys don't die even if you drop the wood/gold/stone/truck on them.<br /><br />I'd 5-star this game if these bugs didn't exist.
B00B7803HO|2.0|Love the show, no qualms there. This is a fantastic series. I usually watch the episodes on PBS for free and when I couldn't wait for episode six to come online, I decided to purchase it from Amazon. imagine my disappointment when I purchased episode 5 instead (labeled as 6) and had just finished watching it last night for free. As far as I can tell, you can't \\"return\\" an episode, can you? They really should try to get the numbering straight!
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|For every app I purchase, I usually throw one or two onto my Amazon Wishlist. This has been there for a few weeks, and I was happy to see it show up today as the FAOTD. It's cute, it's fun, and it's well-made. Being able to re-trace your steps and correct errors is a great feature to this side-scroller.
0345803485|5.0|love the book and i'm already finished reading it and and i cant wait until i get the other two books that i ordered
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Great book about a subject that has been written so much about over the last 50 years.  It really was interesting and great read
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little knife sharpener. Light weight and compact. Perfect for touching up that hunting knife while dressing out a deer.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|The movie about Hachi is about a great dog that has problems once his owner passed away. I would say that all ages can watch this great movie since it has no bad words or images.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am so glad I purchased them as I will probably watch them again in the future.  Also, purchased Season 3 and am really caught up in the program.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Loved the movie.  Bought it for my father-in-law and Dad.  They don't like to go to movies because they are tired of trying to enjoy a movie only to have liberal/democrat/socialist/anti-God stuff thrown in their face.  Here is a movie, &#34;Act of Valor&#34;, which is displaying a true act of valor.  Enjoyable to the end.  God bless our troops.
0374214913|5.0|I had been eyeing this book throughout the holiday book buying season and was sorely disappointed when no one bought it for me. I had to give in and buy myself a copy. The was a portion of a teacher's salary well spent! This is a fabulous romp (especially fun for those of us who live in the bay area) through independent booksellers, secret societies, the search for immortality and the limits of modern technology. I'm thinking I need to ask Mr. Sloan for a cut of his royalties as I've been recommending it to everyone I know.
B006H5120E|5.0|I saw this movie with my wife when I was still courting her.  It's one of the best movies ever made.... and they made it in 3D.  I was just planning to buy a blue ray, but it came out in 3D.  Who would ask for more?  Some 3D movies doesn't have much good effect when done in 3D, but Titanic...AWESOME!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found this book lovely, well written (I read a paperback version, which was well edited) and very enjoyable, although it is bittersweet in that it does make you sad at times. I identified with the main character, although my life has not been similar to hers, and understood her even when she did things I have not done. Unlike some other reviewers, I loved the ending and did not find it entirely predictable. In all, I found it a very good book, I felt I got to know the characters, especially the main character, and the writing was beautiful.
B008XK69S6|5.0|It is the best mp4 player ever<br />I was searching for free music  and you can Lison for free<br />It is so cool
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I will recommend this to everyone who needs to reconnect with their spouse. It makes perfect sense as to why couples can't seem to make things better no matter what they do.
0451209338|5.0|Although this is the first of this series of Daniel Silva novels I did not get to read this one until I had read two other books, beginning with the English Assassin, so it was good to clarify the beginning of Gabriel Allon's involvement in his role.  I found it a really good read and as always wait for the next opportunity to read a novel that is so well written and with such a gripping plot.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|Great movie the best in the Terminator series. I've never seen the director cut, but it makes the movie that much better.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Saul: &#34;What were his exact words, please?&#34; Carrie: &#34;An American prisoner of war has been turned.&#34; Remember those cliffhanger serials they used to show at the movie theaters as a special feature...if you're a Baby Boomer, you remember? Well, think of this as a cliffhanger, a thousand times removed and more sophisticated and improved. I can almost guarantee that after watching one episode, you'll be hooked and that you'll wait with bated breath for the next one...just like we used to do as kids in the theater for serials, like &#34;The Adventures of Captain Marvel&#34;...and so many others. The exchange that begins this review pretty much encapsulates the plot of this serial. Carrie Mathison, is a smart, driven CIA agent who's been told by a highly reliable source that an American POW in Iraq has been turned by the terrorists. She puts no stock in it at the time, but when Marine, Nicholas Brody, is rescued after spending 8 years as a POW, she tells her mentor and superior, Saul Berenson...and the plot, as they say, thickens from there. Claire Danes as Carrie, delivers her most powerful performance on film...my opinion; and the fact she plays a smart driven CIA agent, who also has a mental illness, just adds to the power of her performance. Damien Lewis, except for &#34;Band of Brothers&#34;, also delivers his best performance on film...again my opinion. The third powerful performance is Mandy Patinken, as Saul Berenson, and believe me, his performance is just as riveting as the other two. There are of course many other support players who contribute greatly to the quality of this series, like Morena Baccarin as Jessica Brody, Nicholas Brody's wife; and David Harewood as David Estes, the director of the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. Can't recommend this series too highly...it is a powerful piece of TV programming!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It's difficult to say whether Hoover is better at character development or plot twists. In Hopeless, the two main characters, Sky and Holder, are high school misfits who manage to literally run away from their pain and face it head on at the same time. As they dance around each other in a dating world as unique as their characters, Sky and Holder face a present that is twisted by their pasts. It was easy to guess some of the plot twists, but overall, the book had a wonderfully unique plot line. Good book for mature or older teens. I would have given Hopeless five stars except for a long section near the end of the book that seemed more like an amateur psychology lesson than part of the story. Regardless, I'd highly recommend this author and this book.
B0059XTUEK|5.0|Marilyn Monroe was still a huge star when I reached my teens just as &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34; was being filmed in 1957. I had a huge crush on her...just as most kids my age and older. I saw many of her films in the theater back then and have viewed most of them since. She was a huge star of course (ranked #6 among all female actors by AFI) and sex symbol; and with the right role and direction, she was also an excellent actress. I never knew back then how troubled and fragile and insecure she was; how difficult she was to work with; or about her prescription drug and alcohol abuse. This film is only a mini-biopic of Marilyn, but it does a great job of portraying her as she was in 1957, when she had already started down the road that led to her premature death. Michelle Williams, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Monroe, and is also drop-dead gorgeous, performs masterfully in the title role. Eddie Redmayne, in a breakout performance, also performs superbly as the young starstruck assistant director, Colin Clark, who is assigned to keep up w/Marilyn; and in the process, gains her confidence and falls in love w/her. The story is fact based, adapted from Clark's two books on his time w/Marilyn in 1957. The director and co-star of &#34;The Prince and the Showgirl&#34;, was the great actor, Sir Lawrence Olivier, played by Kenneth Branagh, in his usual outstanding manner. Also look for excellent performances from Judi Dench who plays actress, Sybil Thorndike; and Emma Watson, in one of her first roles outside the &#34;Harry Potter&#34; series; as a wardrobe assistant, who is Colin's love interest before and after his week with Marilyn. This is a great film...one of the 10 best of 2011 in my opinion.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This movie played well and we had no problems accessing it from the list of available titles. I did like it
B005HEDI3K|5.0|hard to imagine it is almost 50 years old.  great job of remastering. clear and sharp with very good sound
B0096HIEE2|4.0|it was a good movie. Worth the money spent on it. good for laughs and drama. It is on par with step up.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|Every one of these songs is touching, beautiful, fun or all three! Scotty McCreery's beautifully deep voice captures your heart and drags you emotionally into &#34;Clear As Day&#34; you'll smile at &#34;Write My Number On Your Hand&#34; and fall in love with &#34;I Love You This Big&#34; all in all a wonderful album!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|I chose a five star rating for this DVD documentary. It is the most thorough documentary covering all aspects of the second world war. Even though it was produced more than 20 years ago,this DVD is still worth buying and watching for anyoe who wishes to get a full insight of the second world war. From all aspects of the Axis and the Allies.The home front,the battles,the survivors personal remembrances,the observations of the war seen by both surviving German,Italian,Russian,British,and American service people.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|JONNY DEPP WAS FANTASTIC IN THIS MOVIE, KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT AND GLUED TO THE TV.  WONDERFUL PLOT AND ENDING. THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT OF A HORROR/COMEDY TYPE OF MOVIE.  AN ALL AROUND GREAT MOVIE TO SEE. !!!!  GAVE IT FIVE STARS FOR STORY, PLUS J. DEPP'S VERSITILE ACTING PERFORMANCE.!!
0802130208|5.0|A mocking take on the ever relatable \\"me against the world\\" motif, this novel held me in constant anticipation of what might go wrong next for its antihero of all antiheroes, the larger than life, always gassy, condescendingly intellectual Ignatius J. Reilly.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed Reilly's ongoing writings: his book within the book and his correspondence with Myrna Minkoff, a far away partner in their own brand of civil disobedience. Within these passages, the protagonist seemed most comfortable, most himself.<br /><br />Though often exaggerated, Toole's depiction of the various people within New Orleans' society felt authentic to me, from bartenders and street vendors to factory workers and one factory owner / owner's wife. For the most part, I felt as if every interaction between these ancillary characters could just as easily occur today, giving the book a sense of timelessness within these capitalist times.<br /><br />Such a shame Toole took his own life at such a young age, I would've loved to read whatever he would've written next. Thank goodness his mother managed to find a set of eyeballs willing to give the manuscript a shot, and thank goodness for what's happened since.
0865479410|4.0|The Antidote is a book for people who are interested in philosophy and the meaning of life, but prefer to have their sermons a bit on the light side.  Oliver Burkeman is laid back and witty, my type of author.  The Antidote suggests that although optimism is not necessarily a bad think, it may keep you from seeing the world as it really is, and, shockingly, an optimistic view is insufficient to ensure happiness.  I agree with Oliver that clear-eyed rationalism is the way to go, even if you have to acknowledge that some bad things, like death, are bound to happen to you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW is all I can say! Beautifully written, full of action. I read the second half of this book in 4 hours.
0756405890|2.0|Reading the rave reviews of \\"The Name of the Wind\\", I had high expectations starting this. The start was promising too. And then turned into pure drivel. Maybe the author was lured by the financial prospects of writing trilogies over writing a single novel, because the story is promising, but was it worth a trilogy, judging by the first book, absolutely not. The story is good for around 100 pages, not anymore. I ended up just glancing over many pages, skipping the irrelevant detail. There were interesting events sprinkled here and there, but mainly the author goes into unnecessary detail into irrelevant stuff. And the character too comes off as arrogant and not quite believable. Apparently Kvothe can master anything his hands lay on. Horse riding, magic, chemistry, you name it, the boy genius can do it and better than anyone else. Come on ! There's no way anyone could convince me into reading the second book.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|This is one of the few movies I've watched more than once. I love Sandra Bullock in thimovie and have to admit this was the first time I saw Tim McGraw in a movie. Their chemistry is great as is Tim McGraw's chemistry with the actor who played SJ.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Wonderful, Colorful Graphics in Well Designed, Challenging levels.  Very Unique game style includes many Interactive Objects that you Use or Avoid by sliding platforms, blocks, pillows (you bounce off to change direction) and opening or closing Ramps.  Very user friendly with REVERT option that let's you Back Up play instead of Restart if you messed up.  Challenges do get much tougher after you play awhile.  One of the most USER FRIENDLY Games I have seen.  Engaging, Entertaining and Satisfying.<br /><br />LIKES:<br />Beautifully designed artwork makes the Graphics very Pleasasnt.  Controls work very well.<br />Lots of Quick thinking Moves to make but with NO UNDO PRESSURE - Casual Play style is FUN.<br />REVERT Button let's you back up to Replay or you can Restart level if you wish.<br />Play is TIMED but you can take as long as you wish.  Timer continues as you REVERT play though.<br />Music is surprisingly Pleasant and Soothing.  Sound Effects are Cute and enjoyable.<br />Options Menu lets you turn Sound Off and/or Change to Tilt Control.  Pause Button is helpful too.<br />Scoring system gives Gold, Bronze or Silver Medal for each level.  Total Stars are also counted.<br />75 ADDICTIVE levels.  15 levels on each of 5 Worlds (so far).  6th World says (MORE TO COME).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br />Absolutely Wonderful game for Leisurely Play.  It keeps you engaged with all the Strategy required to make many moves and quick planning to complete each level.  Just the right speed to challenge you but not so fast that it gets FRANTIC.  Even if you get low scores, you will advance as long as you reach the end of each level.  I APPRECIATE the LOW PRESSURE, Fun style of this game.  It's a KEEPER!
B000HKYA1I|5.0|I'd never heard of the book and based on other reviews I'm glad I hadn't read it. The movie is beautifully shot, interesting, strange, and certainly made me think.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an awesomely fun and addicting game!  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a way to waste five minutes or so a day.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I had no idea this was a young adult novel, but I've never read a book so fast. I couldn't put it down. It had me laughing at the beginning, pissed off in the middle and crying at the end. I didn't expect the dark subject matter, but the truth is that this goes on in our everyday lives and hopefully it brings more awareness.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked it because I am very interested in and believe in the after life.  It's so comforting to know that one who did not believe is now a firm believer due to his experience.  Others are witnesses and it makes me feel closer to my love ones who have crossed over.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|The absolute best high-intensity action / puzzle game ever.  Loved it on Dreamcast, love it now on Android.  For one dollar, this is the best deal on the Android market.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Great dictionary, found very useful in times of need. Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah hate this review
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Was not expecting to receive a digital copy on Amazon Video and receive the Blue Ray for one price.  My kid was very excited to know she could watch either.  Although the online stream version was exceptional quality, I would think the Blue Ray Disc would probably be a bit better and it was just a tad.  Anyway it's nice to know it's included online if your disc was damaged or your player was not functioning.  Happy Camper indeed!
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|The game is decent, but the left and right arrows will randomly not respond for no reason . It's very frustrating.
B00190OHD6|4.0|A good movie to watch for both parties.  Funny, sad, entertaining and cute.  Would recommend and watch again and again.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|ha fun game to play when you should be doing something else.  I enjoy the continuous. runners and this is right up there with the best of them
B002V092B0|4.0|I read this book principley because I had suffered a stroke myself.<br />When you read this you realise that a stroke is a very individual event, it is different for everyone.<br />Knowing that your brain is flawed is scarey.<br />If you have the capacity to come back from stroke you can become a stronger person.<br />I liked this book because you get the feel of what it is like in Jill's head and the fear and confusion that she felt.<br />You also get the insight and her strength as she fights back from her stroke.<br />My stroke of insight is a good read as well, I enjoyed it.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Fantastic show, great if you need to catch up on the serries.<br />Good insite on the time period of early 20th century England.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|I came to read the life of Pi after seeing the film version.<br />The film had for me a dissapointing ending which didnt quite make sense.<br />The book filled in a lot of unanswered questions from the film.<br />The descriptions of surviving with a tiger had me asking myself is this fiction or a true story, because it seemed so plausible.<br />Life of Pi is one of those books that keeps you thinking about it long after you finish reading it.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|Coach Carter is a hard knocks Coach who wont take no bull. It's either his way, or the highway. Oh, and you have to earn a spot to do things his way. Good tell all story of how a High School basketball coach trys to turn around a basketball team, and more importantly an entire school. I highly recommend this film to anyone, even if you arent a basketball fan.
B008OOYALE|2.0|It really is a cute concept and even though money is hard to come by it wouldn't be too bad if you didn't have to pay twice for everything! When you expand to make room for more dragons you pay to expand then you have to pay even more to remove all the trees that were there. WAY TOO MUCH. I've uninstalled it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Pass a few minutes while you're waiting to pick up the kids, or enjoy a distraction on a coffee break.

B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was very hard to get into.  The writing did not draw you in and I had a hard time understanding the idea in the beginning.  Had to force myself to keep reading.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|i choose this rating because this game is awesome and addicting. i like that it is almost like Mario Brothers. i would recommend this to people who like to kill and collect things.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book was so good I could not put it down.  It was well written and a really good story.  Enjoyed!!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I thought it was a great book so I rated it 5 stars.<br />All in all I thought it was a great book<br />It was also really well detailed.<br />And I also thought it was a really funny sometimes.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book took my breath away, literally. I couldn't put it down. I laughed and cried. This story is just riveting.
B0013O123Q|1.0|Disturbing, read reviews prior to watching. This movie shows the darkest side of humanity and the camera changes and music are annoying.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Bros that was swag gives 999999 billion in cash I think that you guys are awesome: )<br />Sooooooo keep it up
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Gets better with every page!<br />Convenient to have the trilogy in one book. Allows the mystery and suspense to continue with no breaks in between.
B009O07NDY|5.0|Well, with over 200 reviewers preceding me, there's really not a whole lot I can add. These two discs offer the original soundtrack to The Hobbit, including four bonus tracks. Some of the music is drawn directly from composer Howard Shore's previous score for the three Lord of the Rings films -- in particular, as one would expect, the basic hobbit theme -- but the vast majority is new. Given the set of events in The Hobbit as opposed to those in Lord of the Rings, this music has less of an epic nature yet supplies just as much emotion as its predecessor. Overall, it's truly magnificent and satisfying in every way. I have a couple small packaging quibbles: The booklet is spine stapled to small hard covers that serve as box, and one staple was already separated from the covers upon delivery. Also the discs themselves are in sleeves glued to the inner sides of the hard covers, making extraction a little challenging; I found the best way to get the discs out was to turn it all upside down and gently shake until enough of the disc emerged to make it easy to grasp. Those nitpicks -- which have nothing to do with the music -- aside, this is stirring material one can return to again and again without getting tired of it.
B006ON41FC|1.0|This game is really fun but it always glitches and asks you to rate it. So here you go. A one star review.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The book was a slow starter.  It actually had me trying to decide whether or not to continue reading it when it finally piqued my interest around the 8th chapter.  The endfing was pleasing, though.  It showed the growth and maturity of the main character (Sky) over a short periodof traumatic time.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Heaven is a place I've always been curious about. These books far exceeded my expectations. I got a visual image of what heaven is like,and I don't know why anyone would want to not experience worshiping our Lord like that.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase. Yet another great release from the Deftones. Koi No Yokan and Deftones (2003) are in heavy rotation.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Like I said above cools my CPU wonderfully. Works like a charm as I come to expect from Arctic Silver, I would only use this on my CPU's as should you.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|MC scores 3 home runs with Suicide Run. I. Didn't have to stay up all night reading to get my fix. Harry Bosch fans can be satisfied quickly on this run. Nice break from the great but long ones!
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book and have bought quite a few for friends to read.  Loved the perspective from the dog but it was not at all corny or juvenile.  It's sad in parts but you end up feeling good about the dog, his owner and the life they lead.
1449320104|5.0|I've always been really impressed with the Nutshell books as a reference.  You' wouldn't want to try to learn C# from this book, but once you've mastered the concepts, you won't want to be without it.  Most of the time I use Visual Studio's help (MSDN) and manage to get by.  But, there's nothing like a good text explanation of a topic to remind you how to use a particular language feature effectively.  This book provides that reference in an easy to find format with a reasonable index.  My only complaint is that it weighs so much.  I'm starting to wonder if I wouldn't have been better off with just the Kindle edition.
B003E6LC6I|5.0|I chose 5 star because it is a great series & kept me interested all through w/ suspense. It is one I could watch over.
B009IA9OLE|5.0|An online gamer friend recommended this highly, and it's just what I was looking for. Download was easy and smooth. You make choices in your role as the \\"Devil's Attorney\\" representing the accused, and the preliminary exchange of barbs between the Prosecuting Attorney and the Devil's Attorney prior to the start of each case are laugh-out-loud funny.  The game starts out with easy cases and strategy choices as you learn more about the mechanics of how various choices affect the outcome of the case, becoming gradually more challenging and intricate.  As a \\"pickup\\" game fully contained within your device, it's a great way to spend from a few minutes to a half hour play when you need a break or have some wait time.  If you want a game that will hold your interest and exercise a few brain cells entertainingly, this is well worth the modest cost.  I am using a Kindle Fire and have had no problems at all playing this game on it.
B0058A119G|5.0|Who picked out that picture on the cover of the CD?  Well it lists Barbra as the producer so I guess it was her final decision.  That being said, it looks like a bookleg copy picture, what was she thinking.  Anyway now on to what's on the inside.... Well I was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased this CD after about a year of trying to decide to get it or not. I was driving a 5 hour drive and saw a Best Buy and pulled in. I have been somwhat put off by her choice of material and her casual performances for a while now. Its almost like she doesn't care anymore, sad really but............this CD is different.  She appears to be having a good time and the mood is more fun and upbeat.  I must say the highlights are the Patrick Williams arrangements, Nice and Easy and That Face. I hope this is a shift for her and her musical career, the woman can still sing and she proves it in this choice of material.  Way to go Babs, lets hear more, PLEASE.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you have not watched this series you should.  It really does a great job of giving you a realistic glimps into that era.  I was fastinated from episode 1 - and surprisingly so was my husband.
0689835604|5.0|The item was exactly what I expected at a price I thought affordable. I had not need to interact with the vendor as the item was what I needed.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I chose this rating because this show it awesome! I like almost everything about the Walking Dead. I would recommend this product to everybody who is not going to watch it with their small children.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As a huge Downton Abbey fan, Season 3 did not disappoint...  And thanks to Amazon, I was able to feed my obsession by watching the episodes before they air on American TV.  Fabulous.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I have been looking for a battery monitor for some time and have been disappointed many times, until I tried this app. It has all the functions that I have been looking for and has run smoothly on my recently updated ( ICS ) HTC Thunderbolt, and a lot of apps don't. The free version is the same as the paid but I bought the paid version anyway. These folks need to keep putting out these quality apps. Thanks.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Written in first person limited, it has an important inner monologue that was left out in the movie. Although the writing style was not my cup of tea, it was fun for the most part. The chapters in the cave seems to last forever but still much more realistic than in the movie. I was overall satisfied but not impressed. Good book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series and how the writer draws you into the family and their staff. I would love to live in this time period and be a member of this family. This series is also very &#34;male&#34; friendly in that I know alot of men who are as addicted to watching as their wives and they talk about the many plot twist just like we do.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I love this game cant put it down I must win lol I play it all the time great game need more wellness tho
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|Beautiful graphics. Delightful sleepy soundtrack. Relaxing game-play. What more is there to say?<br /><br />Sleepwalker's Journey is fun and light-hearted.  After being sneezed out of his bed, the main character must wander through a series of linear mazes to make his way back to his bed on the moon, collecting objects as he stumbles sleepily along. As you play, if you make a mistake, the game can rewind a few paces.<br /><br />Beautiful fun faotd. Worth downloading.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|I thought it was well written and deserved 4 stars. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and I knew would enjoy this as well.
B00AB0NTTI|5.0|All star cast and well done.  It is a very funny movie with a twist and they do not make movies like this anymore.
B00992CF6W|1.0|The game is fun but when I was mining my. kindel whent dead. After it charged. y world was. creative it had changed from survival to creative and I lost 8 diamonds 20 gold and 120 iron. I am very mad and very mad at the Company they made a cool game but weren't smart enough to make a game with no viruses.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow!  Great Book!  Riveting!  I had a hard time putting this book down.  I went on to read all in the series.  It's graphic and sometimes gruesome.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Sesson 3 provides another wonderful roller coaster of drama that makes it easy watching. Great cast that allows us the audience to engage most easily in these Sci-fy stories
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|It is a cute game and I have played it a couple of times. It's just not my kind of game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is amazing and way better than the original temple run. my friend recommend it to me after I tried temple run.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|If you have a reasonable knowledge of quantum mechanics or particle physics  this is not the book for you. Carroll writes very well but his specialty is cosmology. Nothing hidden, Carroll explicitly states this toward the end of the book. If your objective is a  “cocktail party conversation” level of understanding of the LHC or the Higgs boson, which I suspect was Carroll's objective, this book deserves the five star rating I'm giving it. But if you want an understanding of the limitations and future goals of the LHC or an understanding of where the Standard Model of particle physics is lacking I would recommend spending your money and time elsewhere.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|Anybody who has a Kindle Fire should have one of these!  It protects my screen as well as the Casing of my Kindle Fire.  Looks great, too!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Every song is just so damn good. &#34;Thrift Shop&#34; is getting a lot of attention but every song on the album is just so much better (e.g.,&#34;White Walls&#34; and &#34;Neon Cathedral&#34;).
B0058YPL66|5.0|I love this series, wish I could get season two aleady.. This is addicting, suspenseful, and keeps you wanting to watch the next one. Live it.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, it's very realistic. The graphics are amazing!! It really does feel like I'm training the horse.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I read this book on the heals of Born to Run. Despite Scott's tremendous accomplishments, I found the book to come across as very humble. His insights not only into the physical demands of running but also the psychological aspects are great takeaways.  While I'm not a vegan (before this book, 'vegan' had such a negative connotation to me), his thoughts on food intake and running nutritution were eye opening.  It certainly makes me question what I put into my body each day. The Minnesota Chili is unbeliviable! Must read for the serious and semi serious runner!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is one of the most funnest games in my opinion. Every should play this game. Hell ya. Play it today.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Unbelievable!  I'd heard about this book from some of my running friends and decided to read it this winter.  What a page turner! I've heard some who have read say they could do without the 'science' part but I found that to be almost as interesting as the build up to the race at the end of it.<br /><br />Anyone who runs has to read this. You could literally be doing harm to your body by not!
B0095P31L6|3.0|Many old movie references, but I kept nodding off.  Reloaded later to actually see the ending.  Don't plan on seeing again.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This amazing series that should be watched by everyone!!  It gave me a small glimpse of what my grandfather went through @ the Battle of the Bulge when he lost his arm from a grenade thrown into the tank he was commanding.(He never spoke of the war when he came home)  I truly appreciate the xtras that come w/the set; speaking to the real life veterans this series is based on.  The all star cast gave true emotion that is unparallelled in any other historic series.  I think they should show this in schools near Veterans Day so maybe our next generation will gain an appreciation of what past wars were like and what the fighting men and women went/go through.  We received the discs in a very timely manner in perfect condition.
B005HSL626|5.0|Who would have thought that cutting fruit Ninja style could be so entertaining. Its very simple yet lots of fun.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|There is no greater narrator than David Attenborough.  Combine his talents with superb photography and therein lies hours of pleasure watching and learning surprising and astonishing things about the animal and plant world around us, around the world.
B005LAII08|4.0|My daughter received this UCE as a 2012 Xmas present, but we just got around to watching it over last weekend. That's probably because she's turning 16 in March, and she's right on the cusp of outgrowing the appeal of most Disney heroine films (I remember her wanting to see this movie when it was released in theaters in June, 2012, but she never did see it in the theater, and seemed none the worse for it.) In the world of the high school sophomore, last year's priorities can become this year's \\"meh\\" overnight!<br /><br />It turns out that the movie has a level of maturity to it that worked very well for my soon-to-be-sweet-sixteen daughter. From a parenting perspective, I had no problem with the few \\"adult\\" bits that were tossed in, as they were sufficiently humorous and sufficiently brief as to not be off-putting. This is pretty tame stuff by any measure.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film as well, though the story isn't very inventive as stories go. Within the first 15 minutes one can begin predicting what will occur later in the story line. I was happy to see that Disney avoided adding too many contemporary references or characters to the film (Merida's mom tells her to \\"stop doodling\\" in one scene), as such playing to the gallery can become dated in short order (think \\"The Emperor's New Groove,\\" or Robin Williams' Genie in \\"Aladdin,\\" whose ad naseum references to circa 1980s pop culture are lost on audiences 20 years later). I can see \\"Brave\\" becoming a family evergreen, watched each year around St Patrick's Day, along with \\"Darby O'Gill & The Little People\\" and \\"The Quiet Man,\\" even though \\"Brave\\" is set in Scotland, not Ireland.<br /><br />The animation is just spectacular - \\"Brave\\" just won the 2013 Oscar for animation, in fact. The only complaint I have is the complaint I have about most of Disney's recent animated films: things sometimes move too fast, no doubt a sop to pacing their films to a contemporary tempo that will compete with the explosion-laden video games that are so popular these days.<br /><br />Another Academy Award-winning film from Disney/Pixar, though not - I suspect - the kind of film that will garner the repeat viewings the more-traditional Disney fare seems to enjoy, let alone earning a place in posterity in the form of a theme ride at one of Disney's Amusement Parks.<br /><br />Four stars.n video games that are so popular these days.<br /><br />Another Academy Award-winning film from Disney/Pixar, though not - I suspect - the kind of film that will garner the repeat viewings the more-traditional Disney fare seems to enjoy, let alone earning a place in posterity in the form of a theme ride at one of Disney's Amusement Parks.<br /><br />Four stars.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game will keep you entertained for hours.  And, it is very challnging.  At least for me.  Can't seem to get above 40,000 points.  But, I keep trying.
B005JE7XW0|4.0|My wife and I both enjoyed this movie.  It was genuinely funny, as well as a well-done spoof on the slasher/horror genre.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|This is a really fun and challenging game.  Graphics are super.  Recommend this to every Mahjong fan who loves their games.
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Great music but I wish I purchased the CD at Target which includes 4 bonus tracks not available anywhere else.  Amazon, we got gypped.  Cannot download the 4 extra songs on Itunes either.
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I had got a special offer and chose this download as my 1st purchase here for music. It was easy and I really like this album or what ever you call them. It rocks heavy metal for best results play at maximum volume. Thanks Bear
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Excellent continuation of Bared to You. Don't let the repetitive writing at the beginning worry you that you will be reading Bared to You all over again, after refreshing the readers of Bared to You and filling in needed information for anyone who did not read Bared to You the book takes off HOT AND HEAVY! The story is an awesome continuation of the first book in the series that will leave you longing to read the third book! Once again the author combines just the right amount of eroticism, romance, love, and an awesome plot to keep you reading long after you said you were going to stop! New things are revealed and some questions answered but it leaves you longing for answers to things that still have not been revealed and longing for answers to New questions! The ending leaves you satisfied enough as a stopping point which is good considering the 3rd and final book Entwined with You will not be released until June 2013 but leaves you wanting more and it also leaves you highly anticipating the next book. Once again I found there was constant conflict and resolution over and over but while annoying and exhausting it makes it nearly impossible to put down. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars was once again the constant conflict and resolution, problem then fight then make up then REPEAT but highly interesting and this book did reveal some things that were more shocking than what was read in the first book, the characters grow on you even more as you get to know them better. Overall I would say it was fantastic and I cannot wait for Entwined with You to be released!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so amazing! you will like this game whether you like dragons or not. it is so fun and addictive and the dragons are sooo cute:)
B00846REIS|4.0|This book was great. I'll admit I was looking for another read similar to \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" without it being so much alike that I felt like I was reading the same series over again...a friend suggested this. I will admit that at first I felt like it was going to be too much like \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" for me to enjoy it thoroughly like a book you read for the first time and love, I was relieved that once I got a little further in the book that was not the case! If you loved \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" then you will certainly love this but it definitely tells its own unique story, sure there are similarities but to me I found those similarities small and insignificant for the most part. This book had ups and downs and was definitely a page turner, it was so hard for me to stop reading and I finished the book quickly due to that, I wish I would have drug it out a little longer but the second book is available already which is really great considering I wouldn't have been satisfied with the ending if I couldn't have immediately started book two, the ending of this book isn't a good stopping point but in its defense it will have you  scrambling to read book two. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars was there was what seemed to me constant conflict and resolution over and over although in its defense the conflicts and resolutions were different every time &  I still loved this book! I am definitely going to read all 3 books in the Crossfire Novel Series and will add Stephanie Day to my list of awesome authors!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Too many shootings and no interaction between the charactors.  I thought Tom Cruise was a lot better in Knight and Day.
1439152802|5.0|It has been a while since I have given a book a 5 star rating but this one sure deserves it. It is a great story going between present day and the past. I enjoyed every minute of it. The charector develpment was great.
B004I4ETZ6|4.0|Packaged well! I just really like the sticker included for ordering a vinyl! It was used vinyl and it sounds great!
B0086449YA|4.0|Good, not great IMO. I loved &#34;Get Lucky&#34; With some more listening time it might grow one me. Mark is still one of my favorite artists.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|All I can say is WOW!  This book is Very intense....balled my eyes out. Although a good read too intense for me due to the subject.

B005IQZB14|1.0|I read this for a book club group.  It's the only reason I finished it.  Would have not picked it out for myself for sure.  I was so frustrated with the character through the entire book.<br />I read for pleasure and this was not it...
B005LAIISA|4.0|A great family movie with lots of laughs!:) I recommend the whole series of Ice Age movies to all families! Great messages behind them also!
B008XG1X18|4.0|love pintrest but this app is driving me mad.  it keeps freezing on a regular basis and every once on a while it crashes my kindle :(  I'll still use it though, I'm too addicted to pintrest.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We purchased Season II, so that we could see the episodes that we missed before we started watching Season III.  We enjoyed it very much and love the new Season also.

0307352153|3.0|I expected this book to deliver something substantial, but it never did.  I was bored with all the research.  The stories about real people, like Eleanor Roosevelt and Rosa Parks, were nice, but they felt like anecdotes scattered as breaks to the boring stuff.  The ploy didn't work for me.  I'm thinking that I got everything on offer in the book in the introduction and needn't have bothered with the rest of the book.  I expected more from a best seller.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|Its like watching the first footloose with a different cast.The first was a little more exciting this movie you knew what would happen,and when.
0425264351|3.0|Lee Child writes a great action book.  In this, the first of the prolonged Reacher books, his &#34;superman&#34; character uses his own morality decisions to kill, kill, kill.  Much of the violence was gratuitous, such as the crucifixion and gelding of the police chief, the oysters then forcefed to his wife.  Right.  The character development is weak (motivations obscure) and the plot of how the counterfit money makes its circuit unexplained, but, yeah, the action is great.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Having found season I through my Amazon.com account on my Smart TV, I was hooked.  I started Season II and could not have been any happier!  Season II is just as great as the first if not better.  I hope this show never ends!  The only bad part is that now I've almost caught up and am halfway through Season III!
0786867973|4.0|I have to give 4/5 stars because while I love this book (it is very informative and absolutely full of awesome recipes), some of the recipes are more confectionary (like cinder toffee) but the instructions are lacking. I'm sorry, but you can't tell me to boil sugar until it's x color and expect my toffee to turn out. Confectionary requires temperatures, which this book is severely lacking.
0141345659|5.0|Utterly amazing. The emotions this book pulls out of you are jaw-dropping! Beautiful book! You will laugh, you will cry. You will laugh harder and you will cry harder!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This was purchased for my husband and he says that he loves it.  Very realistic and jumps right out at you.
006056251X|5.0|I loved the book! But I do agree with one reviewer who stated we don't know enough about St.Vincent's history. Why was he like he was & what happened between him & his father! To me that info would have enhanced the book.<br />We do see him again in book 4 of the series, but still no more background information about him.<br />This is one series that doesn't have to be read in order, but if it is read in order, this will enhance your enjoyment!
B0009XNUK0|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas gift.  What a wonderful collection of so many wonderful Michael Jackson songs.  My teenage daughter loves this, and what's even better - she and I can enjoy listening to it together!  (Not always true of all the music she likes .....)  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I would order again.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is So fun.I defeated 14 levels. I hope you have fun. it's Totally free!  you should get it!
B008N1LL42|1.0|I'm not saying this is the absolute WORST movie ever produced, but it's in the running for sure.<br /><br />Let's start with \\"kids\\" that run the entire United States Navy, and on top of that...... NONE of those kids can act!!<br /><br />Just awful attempts at acting, and the story is ridiculous, but not as ridiculous at the solutions.<br /><br />Not one person connected to this film could have EVER, EVER been in the military because not one thing, nor one bit of the language is correct in this piece of junk film. From the space-ships that do the \\"BREAST-STROKE\\" in the ocean, to the WWII battle ship in storage for 60 years that starts right up, and still heavily equipped with weapons and fuel, goes into action in an hour of prep to save the world in ways that you simply shake your head and ask yourself, if this was a middle school film project.<br /><br />Words defy communicating how bad the acting really is with almost no exceptions, and the main woman that is a \\"personnel coach\\" that is saving the world is almost the worst I've ever seen except for the 19 year old kid that becomes the captain of the ship. (That's right the pentagon, or heads of state, or military can't do us any good, but a \\"personnel coach\\" does the trick) OMG!!<br />To be a good film....please...TRY to have something in it that is worth watching, and not this terrible, awful collection of outright foolishness.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This was not nearly as good as the first. U run really fast so it is hard to know what is happening. Also the v money thing gets in the way a bit. Also, it is harder to get the boosts. Also u can not see them as well<br /> They r tiny. This is not the best it could . Be. :(
B003KRJNBW|5.0|One of the better films I think you'll ever see when you view the entire thing. The ending is by far the best part, and the acting is terrific as well as the story itself. Wonderful direction too.<br />One of the very few films I watch over again.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Denzel does it again here, what a performance! There was one scene near the end, where you just knew it was about to go haywire for him.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Every song sounds great!  The cd was great!  I absolutely love it!!!  I wished they had a Beatles 2, which could include their other greatest hits!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|A fascinating account of the life of Abraham Lincoln, painstakingly researched and documented by Kearns Goodwin, one of the pre-eminent historians now writing.
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Intrigued writing style, plot unexpected. Not realy happy with the end, a bit too abrupt. Value for money. Will recommend as entertaining.
B008NR91DO|5.0|I can count the number of reviews that I have done on one hand but felt compelled to write this one having been at this show. I know that it comes \\"kind-of\\" late as I have owned it and it has been out for some time. Let me first say that if you are a Gary Moore fan,a Jimi Hendrix fan or a fan of any great guitarist,buy this video and /or CD from Amazon.(And let's not forget Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell).<br /> Gary's performance was part of The Jimi Hendrix Experience Live At Monterey [[ASIN:B000VI6T6U Jimi Hendrix: Live at Monterey]] launch event which was preceded that evening by a screening of this film. The event was held at the Hippodrome in London and was to be broadcast live at several \\"nightclubs\\" throughout England,but that idea was scrapped for whatever reason. However,the event was professionally filmed and this is where we get this great performance of Gary Moore performing with Darrin Mooney,Dave Bronze,Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell!<br /> It truly was a magical night capped off with Gary masterfully playing through a set of Hendrix classics! Gary applied his own unique style to these Hendrix classics and did an unforgetable,amazing job! And,as an extra special treat,playing alongside Billy and Mitch!<br /> Just to clear up some confusion, Gary was actually in very good spirits that night and I actually talked to him at length after the show and he really enjoyed the night. The comment that he had made during Foxey Lady was \\"F*** off bastard\\" and he was calling out someone that was taking flash photos of him whilst he was playing. An absolute no-no that was annoying him.<br /> Only the memory remains now of that night, but I am glad for this release. It has made it possible for me and many others to enjoy the memories and legacy of Gary Moore!<br /> As far as \\"Hendrix-like\\" playing goes, I personally would suggest checking out Robin Trower,especially live material [[ASIN:B000S5596W Living Out Of Time - Live]].<br />I have been to many of his shows and being a Hendrix fan can tell you that closing one's eyes and listening to Robin play is an \\"experience\\". He has a new album comming out [[ASIN:B00A8307BG Roots And Branches]] and also still tours the States.<br /><br />I hope that you have enjoyed this review and that you have found it helpful. I enjoyed sharing it with you. Keep the spirit alive! Gary,you are missed! As is Jimi,Noel,Buddy and Mitch.ing a Hendrix fan can tell you that closing one's eyes and listening to Robin play is an \\"experience\\". He has a new album comming out [[ASIN:B00A8307BG Roots And Branches]] and also still tours the States.<br /><br />I hope that you have enjoyed this review and that you have found it helpful. I enjoyed sharing it with you. Keep the spirit alive! Gary,you are missed! As is Jimi,Noel,Buddy and Mitch.
B0014C0BMU|4.0|Still worth watching, but I thought it was so-so.  The nice part is that it wrapped up the series in a logical way.
B0072OFM28|3.0|Story line is not that great.  Sufficient Roman sex scenes.  Once again, way too carried away with the slashing and fake blood scenes.
B009CF7GRY|1.0|As a fan of the original - of course own that DVD - the remake just could not live up to the hype.  The acting was suspect and its just hard to see a story retold with different characters...just leaves you wanting to see the original.
B009GX6TQ6|1.0|I first paid $1.99 and the quality was lousy!! Sometimes it comes out good. I have an HDMI TV flat screen. So I paid for good quality and it was just as bad. What's up Amazon??? I love NCIS but rent a room so I have to use Roku.I shouldn't have to pay for crappy quality. You should do a monthly rate. Otherwise I will no longer pay for the lousy quality video.
B008XG1X18|4.0|The Pinterest app provides great access to boards and pins. Looks and works great. The only problem is that I've had to reinstall a couple times. Otherwise, it is a perfect app for surfing pins.

B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies season one was much better than I expected. I am not a big fan of Noah Wyle but he does a great job in this series.
B00A757EFW|3.0|A little difficult to maneauver, but is still fun for all of us. Can't go wrong with calssic pac-man game.
B0064W667Y|2.0|While Fables Volume 1 wasn't particularly as interesting as I had hoped, it was far from bad. The comic turned out not being my cup of tea simply because I felt it attempted to make fairy tales \\"darker and edgier\\" but in a run down, pulp fiction way. Despite my own feelings, the art isn't bad and the story is mildly entertaining.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very user friendly with many different options. Makes daily reading of the Bible very easy. Love the daily verse and the bible reading plans.
B007REV4YI|5.0|There's not much to say about this film that hasn't been said.  The movie is fantastic.  Casino Royale is just a notch higher, but this one is right with it.  This is what they should have done after CR, not QoS.  Anyway, don't take my word for it, this is a AAA title, with all the goodness that a major movie studio puts behind a release like this.  Looks great, sounds great, movie is great.<br /><br />I mainly wanted to write about the digital copy situation.  There is a single code inside here that can be redeemed for multiple digital copies.<br /><br />iTunes: The code will let you redeem for an SD version from the iTunes store.  It requires you to put in the DVD disc from the package, but once that's done copying, go to your iTunes library and delete it (but don't delete from iCloud - this assumes you are using iTunes in the Cloud, if you are not, you can skip all this).  Once you've finished doing that, go to the iTunes store, select movies, and then purchased.  In there, you'll find Skyfall with a cloud download icon (assuming you deleted it from before).  Download it again.  It will also download the iTunes extras with the movie.  That's one of the nice features of iTunes in the Cloud with movies.  It's still SD, but at least we're getting an iTunes digital copy from a studio that probably doesn't want to give you one in the first place.<br /><br />Ultaviolet: While I'm not a fan of UV, I recognize it has some weight behind it studio wise.  The same code will work here, and there's plenty of places you can redeem a UV code.  The card gives you a URL to go to - I suggest ignoring that, and going through the vudu site, as when I redeemed my code there, they gave me an HDX version of the movie, which is their \\"ultra High def\\" version - a higher bitrate than regular HD.  So that's a bonus.<br /><br />But I can't recommend this movie highly enough, no matter what the digital copy situation is.  There was some confusion about digital copies pre-release, and now that it's actually out (got mine a day early from USPS), I wanted to post something about really is going on with the digital copies.<br /><br />UPDATE: Forgot to mention that the card inside the box says the digital copy redemption code expires on Feb 12, 2015.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: You can redeem the one code inside the box for BOTH an iTunes copy *AND* a UV Digital Copy.  You don't have to pick one or the other.t it's actually out (got mine a day early from USPS), I wanted to post something about really is going on with the digital copies.<br /><br />UPDATE: Forgot to mention that the card inside the box says the digital copy redemption code expires on Feb 12, 2015.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: You can redeem the one code inside the box for BOTH an iTunes copy *AND* a UV Digital Copy.

B00821OX98|5.0|I found this show by accident and once I started watching it I got hooked. Great show with good character development and acting.
030758836X|5.0|I love this book. Flynn's writing style is brilliant. It has been a long time since I have read a book by an author that made we want to put every other book on my &#34;to-read&#34; list on hold so I could read everything this author has ever written. Plot was gripping. No time was wasted on unnecessary facts and long drawn out plot exposition. The most engrossing book I have read in a long time.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Have no idea if this is a good book or not.  Was trialing Amazon Prime and used the lending library.  When I stopped the trial, Amazon removed my access to the book.<br /><br />Amazon -- if you want people to try Prime, make it less strict.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game l..Would get 5 if I could rotate buildings and there were better help/hints. Also would love to zoom in more and be able to see a report of my city
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Currently sitting here crying the beginning was a little slow but really wasn't expecting this book to turn out the way it did such a great story must read
B0091W7K6K|3.0|Interesting only because it had one of the first bad ass car chase, but other than that very dated.  I didn't see much I would consider good acting. The ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|It made my grand daughter very happy so that makes me thrilled.  I'm glad to get her something she likes.  I haven't watched it myself.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Consistent with the intriguing mysteries, the authors intertwine<br /><br />PENDERGAST family background that readers have craved. An enjoyable read during the 13 Blizzard.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, it was very entertaining, great special effects, interesting story line and well worth the time.

0547884591|5.0|Can't say enough good things about this book, it's not a recipe book, it is a framework book. It discusses the various formulas of constructing good food in a way that one could apply the principals and open a entire new world of viewing cooking. Tim has done it again....
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Test page printed fine, But can't get anything off the web to print. Would paying for the upgrade solve this Issue? This is a question I would like Answered before I pay for the upgrade, But how lazy am I when I can go up to my PC and print .
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app works wonderfully on my Kindle Fire. The graphics are good, as is the functionality of the app. I enjoy playing this app namely because it doesn't appear to have &quot;fixed&quot; games that it deals over and over.

B00B19F3PG|2.0|Not a bad movie, but definitely a decent scary movie. It didn't have the quality and depth of plot that we are used to these days though.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is such a fun show that my husband and I love!  It's so refreshing that it's clean and doesn't show sex scenes.  There are always many stories happening but they're easy to follow!  There's no time to discuss anything while watching, or you'd miss the next exciting thing!
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|This is a good movie with alot of action, minimal gore, and a plot you have to pay attention to. 4 out of 5.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|its great but its not long enough for $4.99. the storyline is typicle but cute. the hidden scenes are very interesting.
0545123275|3.0|★ ★ ★ 3 stars, maybe 3.5. This is YA, with teenage leads (ages 17 and 18). Thought I'd give it a try, given that I like werewolves. Basic plot is told in synopsis and by other reviewers, so I'll just respond to the book.<br /><br />Point of view: The POV shifts from heroine to hero, shifting every chapter, pretty much. I liked the shifting POV, but at the same time, I didn't: We never stayed long enough with either one to really feel the character. Also, had to concentrate on who was speaking with each transition. Some chapters (and POVs) lasted only a few pages.<br /><br />Writing style: Decent. Stiefvater has a way with words. I didn't read Sam's song lyrics. Skip skip skip (Tolkien she's not, and I skip his songs!). I noted no typos.<br /><br />Story: Plot holds together, except for one big hole. To reveal it, I must spoil the resolution (conceived by two girls, happy to say). So, big spoiler !! coming: (view spoiler) The story is a bit depressing and grim. I didn't laugh. Not once. Not much suspense: I guessed the solution, but not the details. I guessed the villain. I did not predict everything, though. Not Beck. As for the main characters, Sam and Grace were likable, but I just didn't feel deeply drawn to them, perhaps due to the aforementioned head-hopping.<br /><br />Pacing: Uneven. Starts off strong, gradually slows down enough to consider throwing in the towel, then picks up again, so the last third (or more) was gripping.<br /><br />Romance: Sweet. No love triangles. (Yes!) Pretty much instant devotion. But this is YA, and for some reason it felt like it. In contrast, I just finished another YA romantic fantasy involving an ugly Goblin King, yet [[ASIN:0805081089 The Hollow Kingdom: Book I -- The Hollow Kingdom Trilogy]] didn't feel like a YA book. (a better book, in my view).<br /><br />Secondary characters: Teenage Isabel was the most interesting and dynamic. The rest were okay, too. (Rachel. Beck. Jack. Salem. Olivia. etc.)<br /><br />In the interview at the end of the e-book, Stiefvater says she wrote SHIVER because she wanted to make people cry, like she cried when reading [[ASIN:015602943X The Time Traveler's Wife]]. I didn't cry -- but my ♥ softened a few times.<br /><br />Gripe: The ending was clearly a HEA -- no surprises there in a romance -- but some details of the resolution were not clear. Maybe I'm dim, but I flipped back several times, trying to understand why he just stood there. Dunno! I wish Stiefvater had provided another chapter, explaining what happened to Sam during the last couple chapters of the book. An epilogue with Sam and Grace celebrating Christmas seemed in order, too.<br /><br />I don't plan to continue the series, but who knows?<br /><br />PS. My all-time-favorite werewolf is William (Lord Bill) in [[ASIN:0441019455 Bayou Moon (The Edge, Book 2)]], a cross between sci-fi, urban fantasy, and paranormal romance. But be warned: It's youngADULT, rather than YOUNGadult.ツrview at the end of the e-book, Stiefvater says she wrote SHIVER because she wanted to make people cry, like she cried when reading [[ASIN:015602943X The Time Traveler's Wife]].

0525478817|5.0|The main character isn't likable, but that's ok. She feels real, and that lets the story draw you in, and actually make a difference in your life.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I cannot fathom why Fox would have canceled this show, perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time.  Regardless, this is one of the most unique science fiction shows in the history of entertainment, and it had so much to offer.  My only hope is that they decide to strike production back up sometime soon.  If you like sci-fi, you'll like this, if you like westerns, you'll like this, if you like drama, action, comedy, you'll like this, it's a perfectly rounded show and I think the reviews can speak to that!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far this game is actually pretty kool. it is a bit challenging but its a kook game.  kinds hard to get points to buy other games tho.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game cause it's shows how many levels their are I love it I think you should GAME  oh wait I know you  should  get this ,.GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|this amazing app is just like AMAZING I like it I use it everyday. its awesome and I hope everybody else things so too
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it's a really fun game, would be nice if there were actual levels but the continuous play is ok too
B009POCG5Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood does not disappoint.  Arrives on time.  Amy Adams is also fantastic.  A good movie that won't let you down.
1844137864|4.0|It's a well done compilation of Banksy's work. The pictures are great and you can have a good overview of the work of this graffiti artist
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I haven't even had this for 24 hours and I am already completely in love and totally addicted to this great game.
B001DTUU7A|4.0|Just a great family movie. The Grand Kids watch it over and over. I've seen it once too often I guess.
B004HYHANK|5.0|I read \\"The Other Woman's House\\" first. It was great to get the background on Charlie and Simon in regards to the Fancourts.
1608871452|5.0|This is truly a must have for any Supernatural fan!  It is packed full with great pictures and tons of information from the show.  I read the whole book in one day, I loved it so much.  I especially liked the little surprises along the way from the postcard pics of the boys, to the Carver Edlund book cover posters, and so much more.  This was worth the money and it looks great on my coffee table with or with out the book jacket on it!  If you are not sure you want to add this to your collection I tell you now &#34;don't think just buy&#34; you won't regret it!!
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|This game is absolutely charming, adorable, cute. Don't let the easy pace and the first few levels fool you, though. It becomes quite challenging to guide the little sleepwalker safely to his cozy bed while collecting all the stars and moons. This is truly a gem of a game.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I love zombie based stories, and this one is no exception. I love the tv adaptation, and this series so far :) definitely recommend
B008X8QCTO|1.0|Do not buy this game. The so called bonus chapter that you can purchase is the game solution.  I wish Amazon would allow a zero star rating because that's what I give this game.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had to have part two to read what happens next!  Couldn't imagine why would need third book, but now I see!!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|That was one of the best books I've EVER EVER read!!!!! Can't wait for the next book The Activist! YAY!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game! I really like it it's a lot of fun! Sometimes I wish I had a real horse they are just so beautiful!
B0041KKYBA|4.0|Leaves a lowly citizen with many questions....what can we do to elect/appoint people with the country's best interest at heart.<br />Too many just use and abuse the system for their own gain.  At least President Obama has not been eager to start another war.  We have to do more for ourselves.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This will take your breath away as her CD's do  - if you love Susan Boyle, this will not disappoint!
B00000DQWT|5.0|I am a big Pat Metheny fan and had always wanted to find the CD that had &#34;Chris&#34; on it. The entire album is beautiful and I completely happy with it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really cool game, it is like temple with just kids subways and more fun. I really like it and I know lots of people will like it also.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Good book - took a bit to get into but then it cruised along nicely.  As with all Clancy books - the fight scenes were a tad far-fetched but overall the story was good and the book was very enjoyable.
0439023513|5.0|Mocking Jay. As in Catching Fire I could not put it down. This is a great series. The people are well established and the story line is very good.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|If you want to complete your new Adele collection, then 19 is necessary. If you're a casual fan who discovered Adele because of her 21 album, then you best stick to 21. The 19 album just doesn't compare energy-wise.
0439023491|5.0|This is another book that once started I did not want to put it down. Love it!! The story will keep you reading to the end.
B00821OX98|5.0|The quality of the streaming is not always as good as it should be.  I have noticed that I tend to get better quality streaming from<br />netflix over amazon prime.
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|Being from Turkey, the historical points were especially interesting to me...almost like a history lesson. Great acting too! I hope everyone can see the bonus features as well.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A nice twist at the end.  Mr Sparks has a way of making me really care about the characters in his book.  I was not disappointed!
B0095P3ULC|4.0|Great movie series, fun to watch hope it continues with more sequels.  This one was as good as the first ones.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Purchased this digipak after a too-late Christmas gift idea was mentioned by my son.  Put on my wishlist and received reminder, so decided to buy it as a &#34;back to college&#34; gift to surprise him.  WOW!  He was thrilled with this gift and I even got a &#34;Love you Mom&#34;, so was well worth the cost.  Arrived in excellent condition with very quick shipment.  Would certainly purchase from this vendor again.  Thank you!
B009MF5BXK|4.0|The plot is silly & predictable, the action is over the top, but the real fun is seeing these older actions stars appear on film and demonstrate they still have it. The Governator and Willis this time have much larger roles, and there's Chuck Norris and Van Damme to boot. Also the original cast of Sylvester Stallone , Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren , Jet Li  and a number of others.<br /><br />Explosive fun!
B00B780TAK|5.0|I absolutely love this series!!! I would however like to see the poor family have more happiness! Really? First Sybil and now Matthew?? Can we not find drama without having to have everyone die off the show??? That is my only qualm with the series to date.<br /><br />The show really portrays how I would picture the time period, every detail of it. The attention to detail even for the surroundings is wonderful. I give many 'props', if you will, to the acting, directing, production, etc. for the series. The writers are wonderful, with the exception of the above mentioned. I hope to season 4 brings MUCH more happiness than death!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Really, they made a perfect choice for Brolin to play a younger K. It's uncanny.<br /><br />Not as good as the first, much better than the second.  Great action, and quite a few funny moments.<br /><br />If you liked MiB but were scared off by MiBII, then come back for the fun here.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I normally enjoy biographies....but find this one rather boring and repetitive.  Am only 30% thru and already am not eager to keep reading.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|Easily my favorite batman movie.hands down.great story.part 2 is just as amazing.for any batman fan this is a must own
B00027JYLC|5.0|This film is in The National Registry For Film Preservation at The Library of Congress for good reason. All of Tod Browning's films seem to deal with the darker side of the human psyche using complex metaphor and engrossong story telling. Freaks is his masterpiece. He was a visionary film maker who knew how to get under the skin, crawl up the spine and bury thoughts in our brains that would never go away. In this film, he weaves a tale of sloth and greed where the &#34;normal&#34; ones are the real abhorations. It is a classic morality story where the underdog wins in the end and the viewer is left to walk away with  nightmarish images of people crawling through mud in the rain. knives between clinched teeth, on a mission, not for revenge, but to put an end to evil, and wondering if we, ourselves, are also deserving such a fate for our prejudices towards those we refuse to try and understand let alone empathise with. It is a film that is just as powerful today if not more so than when it was made. I'm not sure this film could be made today even if somebody wanted to try. It is too real, visceral and haunting, like the ghost that it is.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Excellent character development, I could not  stop reading it.I had no idea that this was in fact based on a true  event.
B00BECZPI0|3.0|Just watched the the mid season opener and was disappointed. It just seemed empty. To many sub-plots and an anticlimactic ending. I just hope the next comes back on par with the previous episodes or I get to find something else to watch. Was just up to the hype given the last two months.
B009K86D86|5.0|This Should Be Mandatory Viewing In school. Stop putting celebrities on pedestals and pay attention. They are poisoning us for population control. Eat locally and know where your seeds are coming from.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book.  Reading about the lives of the people living through world war 2.  It was about the involvement of Russia, England, Germany, France, and the USA.  The people in Europe and England lived through horrible times and the soldiers too.  Hitler was brutal and so was Stalin.  It was not a good world to live in if you opposed Nazis and the communist regimes.
B009Z5BPZK|1.0|They wasted the last ten episodes of Gossip Girl on meaningless plots like Nate and Serena dating a daughter and her father and Chuck investigating Bart Bass. The only decent episodes were episodes 8 and 9. The finale was rushed and a mess. Don't bother buying this DVD set.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the best series ever aired.  From the period appropriate costumes, dialogue and scenery to the superb acting.  Downton will having you crying, laughing and hyperventilating every episode.  Simply Superb!!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|First things first: My actual rating for &quot;Temple Run 2&quot; is 3.5/5 stars. I chose 4 because I don't want to turn off people completely to this game because of it's imperfections...there is a lot to appreciate here. But then there's stuff that has left me wanting to throw my Kindle Fire across the room.<br /><br />Here's what I like: GREATLY improved graphics. New gameplay elements that increase the fun of the predecessor. Challenging new achievements. Cool rewards system that keeps you working toward earning the next prize. And Imangi Studios stepped up the difficulty, which will definitely keep you on your toes and addicted. Overall, a great sequel.<br /><br />And then there's the other stuff:<br /><br />Gotta say this: &quot;Temple Run 2&quot; is pretty laggy. Oftentimes it'll run just fine, but at other times you'll have to play through a level full of tiny skips and freezes. Sometimes you live. Or not.<br /><br />A day after downloading, I tried to turn the graphic quality all the way up. It looked FANTASTIC....but it caused the game to lag so much that playing was impossible. Then the game refused to load. For three days. Really frustrating. Now that it's back, I'm almost afraid of it happening again.<br /><br />Also, there is a &quot;Save Me&quot; feature allowing you to respawn if you die....for a price. During gameplay you can collect huge green emeralds for this reason. The first respawn is 1 emerald, the second is 2, the third is 4, the fourth is 8, and I assume it keeps doubling from there. I say that because I've never gotten that far without the game FORCE CLOSING (and sometimes this causes new data to be lost). Also frustrating.<br /><br />So, yeah, 3.5 stars out of 5. I guess I have mixed feelings about &quot;Temple Run 2&quot;. Which is unfortunate. Underneath all of the imperfections is an amazing sequel and a near-perfect game in general. I just wish they had postponed the release a little while to work out the bugs.<br /><br />Then again, I still find myself playing it. Interesting.I still find myself playing it. Interesting.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|Caitlin Moran mixes humor and seriousness in a wonderful way.<br />She has even made ​​me realize that I'm a feminist!
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|New and different. So much of TV is the same old stuff. I really enjoy this show. I really hope there is more to come
B0096A9QXC|5.0|This game is a definite 5 star app. It is well worth the price. Now the kindle fire just needs to have hill climb race
B001NHNG64|4.0|The second installment of the Jack Reacher series, &#34;Die Trying&#34; pits our hero against a nasty coalition of militia men in northwestern Montana. Most of the Reacher tropes are already present: the unspeakably evil opponent, a damsel with whom Jack can couple (almost an afterthought here, lost among the myriad escape attempts), the need for Jack to think/shoot/fight his way to the truth and save the day. For Reacher fans, a rip-roaring yarn. For those new to the series, perhaps some questions. Why is the villain so unbelievably patient? &#34;I should have shot him right away.&#34; Yep, still trying to figure out why he didn't. The story sags in the middle and is probably a bit too long. Captured, free, captured, free, captured, free: fairly repetitive. However, Reacher has a spectacular moment that Childs writes so convincingly that I could hardly keep reading I was so terrified. When Childs has his &#34;A&#34; game going, there is no one better. A good read, a satisfying outcome and on to #3 in the series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book is a masterpiece. One of Stephen Kings best. Some of his books, as you may know, have ridiculous endings, like \\"It.\\" However this ending is the perfect ending to a very heavy book. At the end of the book, you get the feeling that George or Jake, I like calling him George because his life with his true love occurs with the name George, is truly happy that he didn't go back and met Sadie again. Overall his best non-horror book ever written, hands down.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I love this story about Megan& Connor a true love story,touchig how two broken people learn to love and trust and it's sexy too

B000W93CHC|2.0|I was so impressed with Pillars of the Earth but like most sequels this didn't work. It seemed to go on and on as if the writer was simply trying to flesh out the story for whatever reason. The on and off relationship between Merthin and Caris was boring boring boring! And if the writer bought the plague back again I was going to close the book!!  Seems to me the idea was there but it was way too long and repetitive
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Kids love this game. They work hard to get gems and laugh at the monkeys. They joined all the hype
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|game can be addicting but dont like the fact that everytime i turn my device off my progress gets erased
0470901071|4.0|I am taking full advantage of the tome.  The writting is understandable and the labs and quizes at the end of each chapter drive the point home. I have also acquired the video presentations complementary to the text and Mr. Lamle is a very good presenter.<br />As I prepare for the CCNA exam I believe this will credibly equip me for that endeavor.
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|I really enjoyed her first album. I just don't like the sound of this one as much. Plus there really isn't a breakout songs apart from Lights but that was from her first album. I guess the label decided to put it here because they knew she needed something good.
0062200909|5.0|A well-crafted edition, containing a great representation of the Hobbit/Middle Earth world, this book also delves into a facsimile of the methodology of the back room designs for the set pieces for the motion picture. Highly recommended.
0307950654|2.0|I wanted to like this book.  I got about halfway through and gave up.  It was not up to P.D. James's excellent mystery writing.  Would not recommend to fans of either writer.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I thought this book was a great read. It has surprising twist and some not so surprising twist. Overall, I very much enjoyed the read and it left me wanting more of what Colleen Hoover has to offer.
0393342212|5.0|It's a really great book. Fast delivery. The book is in great condition. Definitely recoment to anyone with two or more kids!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|This deviation from Bourne Matt Damon) with Jeremy Renner playing as a more advanced operative and the new LARX operation is very mysterious and alluring. I really hope they continue along this story line. Jeremy Renner plays the part of Aaron Cross with style and finesse that Matt Damon doesn't have. I can't wait to see more of this great intriguing story. I would love to see Renner play Scott Ambler as well too if they ever get around to writing a screenplay to it.This is a bargain at the price it's being offered at as well.

B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I love FFG games and board games in general and always thought they'd make a perfect port (well..some) onto tablets. The amount of pay-2-play and just garbage games on tablets is infuriating. Finally, this game offers a quality (artwork and presentation are awesome) experience, though the full set of the game (all expansions) is a bit pricey. I still paid it for nothing more than to hope that FFG releases more content for the Kindle HD. Once you purchase, its yours, no more ridiculous fees.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|The movie kept my attention.  I will watch it again to pick up more details.  This whole affair infuriated me when Valerie's identity was exposed.
B00005614N|5.0|Better yet, listen to this collaboration, which gives a practical demonstration of what the word means.  Take two of the greats of jazz and ask them do what they love to do ... make great music.  Put them together, with both filled with the excitement, challenge and inspiration that comes from playing &#34;the game of What If&#34; with a true peer of the same stature ... and you get something better than either could do alone.  That's saying something !  When to listen ?  Any time. Just sittin' and chillin' .  Cooking dinner. Working in the home office. Pruning the roses.  Even as a &#34;lullaby&#34; to go to sleep by (personal disclaimer: I also occasionally go to sleep to Led Zeppelin) !  A good choice of disks no matter what kind of music you like and no matter what you are doing while you listen.
0446581348|2.0|If you are looking for a &#34;how to&#34; manual, this is not it. If you are looking for examples of run-of-the mill, polaroid snapshots of 13-ish girls &#34;applications&#34; of makeup items, then you will appreciate this more. Do not buy this if you are even thinking about attempting to become a makeup artist or if you are trying to learn professional techniques. This seems more fitting for the pre-teen getting exposed for the first time to using makeup items. Find it for $1 and get discounted shipping or bundle it with something to offset the shipping just so you can at least say you have it.
0060245867|5.0|I bought his as a gift for my niece on her son's first birthday.  Little does she know how much truth is in this delightful little story ... so many chapters of the story lived since my son's birth 17 years ago.  Just last night, my son's Mom got the &#34;double whammy&#34;:  Sweetheart, it's been a long time since you made shrimp creole. Yeah ... I guess I could make it this week end.  You know, it's just not right unless there is a lemon meringue pie for dessert.  Mmmmm (&#34;dear&#34; caught in the headlights look).  Hey, Mom, I don't remember your lemon meringue ...  Poor Mom, forever giving her mice cookies !
3836522845|5.0|I can't understand why there is such a big deal about this guy's work other than he had an idea and shot it first, then made sure MANY people saw it right away. So it was VERY encouraging to see that the ONLY thing that made this name a household name in photography was EXPOSING his work to others. MANY others. Don't get me wrong, there are very creative ideas in this book as far as a photographic concept point of view. But if you are expecting some great artistic-technical expert works, you won't find it here. Generic photoshop effects, a lot of which are not very good by today's standards of even the &#34;Amateur&#34;. Many shots look as though they were just shot with a film point-and-shoot camera. And very well may have been. This book should call to notice the possibility that ANY photographer can become a celebrity legend, if he/she just gets ther quirky pictures in front of millions of viewers.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|BOY was I WRONG!<br />This item is great! It uses standard USB connections and charges off EVERYTHING that has a powered USB connector. It lasts all day minimum and makes my mid range headphones and earbuds sound AMAZING. You won't believe it when you first hear it. I can't believe I had to BUY this items and why manufacturers just don't integrate this set of electronics into these expensive devices we already buy! Get these.

0316286850|5.0|I have seen this book in a few beauty salons across the country, but mostly used, I think, as a decorative item rather than a reference. Well let me tell you something, this book changed EVERYTHING for me as far as appreciating a true makeup &#34;artist&#34; as they pertain to my industry of photography!! The &#34;transformations&#34; this guy made on the subjects within this book is simply magical. It has taken my level of quality portrait production not only to another level, but to a whole other world!<br />If you are a wannabe or up-and-coming makeup artist, this is a no-brainer. But if you are a portrait photographer, you owe it to yourself to get and view this book, and get to know who it's author is (was).<br />I have given MANY of these as gifts (or &#34;instruction manuals&#34;) to acquaintances I have met and thought had potential. Both MUA's and wannabe models as well. I have about 4 more on hand and am thinking about buying some more! :-)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book as it concludes Christian and Anastasia's story. I loved every bit of it and left me wanting more to read!
B0091REZMW|4.0|So, this is an edited review,  with the bad stuff first. I dropped my original rating from five to four stars (I'd do 3½ if I could).<br /><br />After playing  the game daily for a couple  of months, I've found a few frustrating issues. The most frustrating is that I receive a 'check connectivity' error far, FAR too often. If I'm trying to help someone on a quest (this has NEVER been successful) or if I am trying to view my pending friend requests or leave a message on someone's wall, and other times.  Funny thing, though - if  I click  on \\"Shop\\" I have NEVER gotten an error about connectivity.  **I do not use real $$ in this game.**<br /><br />Another frustration is  recent - there is apparently some sort of graphics upgrade (three screens). I have downloaded the updates both en masse and individually but it only 'takes' until the next time I start the game. I would be fine with ignoring this if the updates stayed in the events stream, but they insist on popping up screens prompting me to download again. It's frustrating AND gets in the way of what I'm trying to do on-screen.<br /><br />And  then there's the lack of help or useful forum information. I have no idea what the '3000' number is for in the general's bunker. I don't know what happens if I banish a gypsy from a friend's screen (does it benefit the friend or me?). I don't know why I haven't seen a skeleton, vampire or werewolf for over a month.<br /><br />Now, for the good stuff. I have played multiple times per day for a couple of months. The searches in the rooms haven't gotten boring, visiting, gifting and helping friends hasn't gotten boring, banishing everything I can hasn't gotten boring. I will continue to play daily - at least until the frustrating issues begin to outweigh the entertainment value.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Have folowed the avengers and all the characters for many years.  Captain America is amoung my most favorite.  Chris Evans is great in the part.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have only used it one time to download an e-book.  It works exactly as it was supposed to work.  Just wish it came with the kindle rather than having to purchase seperately.
B0034G4P80|4.0|Like the arrogant character and to watch what the character becomes in the movie, really makes the God like figure seem more real and you can sit back and enjoy the story.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great story/romance as usual, by Sparks. Just waiting for the movie to come to town.<br />I'm hoping it will be soon and scripted as well as the book.

0307341577|5.0|There's a rare talent at work in 'Dark Places' - from the first pages I knew it was not going to be a pleasant read, but I was equally sure it was going to be a good one.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn introduces us first to Libby Day in her own words: \\"Draw a picture of my soul, and it'd be a scribble with fangs.\\" One of two survivors of the Day killings, Libby has reason to have a bleak picture of herself. The other survivor, her brother Ben, has been in prison for over twenty years for the brutal murder of their two sisters and their mother in the tiny hours of the morning in January, in 1985. Inexorably, we are drawn into Libby's story and the story of that dark day, years ago.<br /><br />What follows is told primarily from Libby's perspective in the present day, as she unravels a tangled cord of lies and misdirection that has throttled her life, getting to know all over again the events surrounding that terrible day. Barely functional and running out of money, she meets Lyle, a member of the Kill Club, who have followed her history obsessively and are looking for more. Interspersed throughout her story are the events of the day itself, told through the eyes of Patty, Libby's mother, and of Ben himself, leading up hour by hour to the killings themselves. Each voice is individual, recognizably unique to the character, unerring in its expression.<br /><br />As I read, I knew it was coming and I knew it was going to be bad. And yet I kept going. With razor-sharp prose and an elegance of language, with surprising turns of phrase and relentless pacing, Flynn had me enthralled from the first page, pulling back the curtain steadily, with as sure a hand as I've ever read. Not only did I hunger to find out what happened, but also to see what other surprises she had waiting for me along the way. And there were plenty, enough even for me.<br /><br />'Dark Places' is a masterful exploration of the hidden undercurrent of the American family, of the things that can tear us apart, of the myriad ways we can be damaged, of the dark corners we find to hide in, and what must be done to heal from that seemingly irreparable hurt.<br /><br />Simply put, this a novel that does not flinch, that's not afraid to go all the way - and one that makes us go willingly, eagerly along for the ride.f the myriad ways we can be damaged, of the dark corners we find to hide in, and what must be done to heal from that seemingly irreparable hurt.<br /><br />Simply put, this a novel that does not flinch, that's not afraid to go all the way - and one that makes us go willingly, eagerly along for the ride.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|this game is great.  its fun to play. its a lot better than the first one .but now every time I click on it it loads and goes back to the home menu. I liked it when it worked. :)
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great fun. small learning curve. official designs and voices! it is a tad repetative. and the best options are obviously paid for.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|There's a certain point in the story where you know a decision must be made and you're hoping it will be the right one.  You won't be disappointed!!
B0000931QA|5.0|Listened to this cd, and it is very quality  sound!!  Very happy with this.  Will definitely recommend this to all

B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Wow.  Once I started to play this, I couldn't stop.  I have it on my phone, my tablet and now my Kindle!  I'm now to the &#34;Bonus&#34; section and I'm hoping there will be more after that.  Otherwise, I'll have to delete off my devices and start all over!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game. Just like temple run, very addictive. Works great on my Kindle but sometimes it has a small glitches.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I had fun at the very beginning of this app but now that I've gotten to the other islands, it keeps playing the same gave over and over, even after I win them!  So I think I'm going to delete it off my apps.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|oi now first I love this game and I really think you will like it this is the first time in my kindel fire hd but I do have it on my I pod I pad and my daddy's I phone 4s
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Liked item but I won't be purchasing another copy. Item was for my personal daily use and one DVD is sufficient
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|Was tricked by bestseller rating. I will do more investigation before buying from best seller list again. Story line could have been put in two chapters.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I love Rick riordan so much. However I have one question. In the next series that Percy is still in he is not invincible.??????
B004132HZS|2.0|I watched this on the recommendation of a friend.<br /><br />The acting is splendid.  So is the dialogue.  Witty, quick, crisp, unpredictable, funny.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, up to a point.  Sherlock's computeresque rationality gets a little tiring.<br /><br />The photography is also beautiful, which makes the series watchable.<br /><br />But the plots are little short of idiotic.<br /><br />First, serial killers, or killer.  Dull, dull, dull, and pointless.<br /><br />Second, needless convolutions in the service of--convolutions.<br /><br />When the third (and last) of the set was done, I could not remember a single one; and I was glad.
B00466HM28|5.0|For the price, this little guy is perfect. Plenty of functionality and more than I'll ever use. I'm a guitar and vocals guy doing serious home recording projects, and needed a small MIDI controller that wouldn't crowd my small space. Knowing very little about MIDI technology, I got this up and running in minutes and it has opened up tremendous possibilities for my projects. Highly recommended.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|very Meh.  They got lazy this album.  sounds like the last two with a bit more whining.  Thankfully it was only $3
B000P0J09W|5.0|This is a classic and entertaining movie. My family reaches for it once in a while and we always enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game! !:) it is the best game ever.  to visit your friends u have to have the Internet on.but most people don't read the reviews before they buy it then it ins up having to pay real money. I promise u this doesn't pay teal money its all fake!!! :):):)!!!!!!!!
1452110581|5.0|It is worth the money.  It is very cute and funny.  I gave it as a gift and it ended up being passed around the party.  Everyone loved it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its so real and fun! maybe it could cost less to get new things but its awesome! you should download it now!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is great.  In fact, this series is one of my favorites of all-time.  I recommend to everyone.  The book is extremely well-written and easy to read.  I could not put it down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Im too lazy to write a long review. Just know that this game is awesome. Provides hours of fun. Will keep you occupied.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I just cannot get enough of this series.  Extremely well-written, yet easy to read.  One of my favorite series of all time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is so good but I hope they update it more soon because there is not that many bricks in it, and you can not play in your place you made in survivial mode so that is the only two bad things about it.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Great book.  Ender was a great character throughout the story.  You often forgot how young he was based on the difficult lifestyle that was expected of him.  The end of the book was wonderful and threw in some twists.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The first season of this show rocks.<br />It might be the best television.  The story is great and the characters are riveting.<br />You will not want to stop watching to see what will happen next.<br />You can't help but get involved in each characters well being.
0345529057|4.0|I started with a library book and became more engrossed in the story than I thought I would.  Book Two is looking good too.
B003Y5H556|4.0|The plot is ok.<br />The blue ray looks amazing.<br />And why not watch a movie with Amanda Seyfried.  She nice to look at for 1.5 hours.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|I am going to look for something I can put on the grip to make it more comfortable and non-slip.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv.  Great acting and engaging story line.<br />If you like character development this is the show for you.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|I do not recommend this camera pack at all. Second week of use the top strap broke. I know send it back, just don't want to mess with the hassle!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|If you have 2 hours to kill and can't decide on a movie, watch this.<br />The plot is interesting.<br />The 2 lead actress are rather enjoyable to look at.
B008NEMPTO|1.0|this movie is the same as previous movies poor 3d and not full screen , i would not recommennd this movie
B00886XQO0|5.0|The sound is amazing, the design is flawless, and I really can spot the enemy before they spot me!!!! The best wireless headset ever!!
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|there was not a full screen ,making the 3d verry weak. i would not reconmend this movie to any one
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an amazing ham. I have to admit I have temple run 2 and it is good actually great but temple run the first is AMAZING too!!!!!!!!! I say that everyone should download this app!!!!!!
B003Q6CUAI|2.0|It did not work for me although I lost an ititial 2 kgs on the protein only 5 days, it went back on as soon as I  added  the  veges.<br />I have been diagnosed with diabetes which may also be a factor
B007F7QG0Y|2.0|I'm only a couple of hours into this audiobook, and if it weren't for the thought of Johnny Depp cooing into my ear, I doubt that I would have gotten this far. With all the drugs Richards did, how could he possibly remember with such detail all the years of his childhood? And really, who cares? I got this hoping to be entertained; I'm waiting....
B001E9641K|5.0|This is a great game that requires a bit of thought.  Wish there was more trains for each player and lots more destinations as the game feels like it ends too quickly!  The price of this game is on the high side (not sure why) but I certainly don't blame the seller.  It's available in LIMITED stores and even those stores charge more than what other games of similar quality go for.  But this seller was awesome and I certainly would buy from them again.
1451620829|5.0|I'll start by admitting Peter Criss was my least favorite member of KISS when I enlisted in the KISS Army Lo, those many years ago. I did, however, and still do believe Peter Criss delivered the quintisential rock drum solo EVER on KISS Alive!, so he still factored highly on my list of rock heroes. Since reading his book I may have to re-assess my initial opinion of him in regards to KISS member ranking. With his heartfelt words Peter caused me to view him in a diferent light, a light cast without the benefit of KISS' spin-doctor media machine. It should be obvious my KISS creds are in good standing based on my loyalty as a long-time (and former) fan. As such, I feel I am emminently qualified to critique anything the four original KISS members say or sell, as I was the idiot buying every little thing they plastered the KISS name on.<br /><br />Without a doubt this book will serve as the most honest re-telling of the behind the scenes occurrences from KISS' heyday. Peter has a way of giving the reader a sense of trust with his every word... mainly, I believe, because he relates his tale in very common terms and also because he isn't afraid to admit that he has felt so overwhelmed at times that he broke down and cried. I can't imagine the high and mighty Gene Simmons honestly admitting he shed a single tear for any reason. It would only make Gene seem really human after all, and as he has freely admitted he is only \\"Almost Human.\\"<br /><br />Peter reveals he is childlike (not to be confused with childish). It occurs to me that we should all try to hold on to the innocence of childhood as well as try to emotionally mature, as we grow older. He manages to exhibit both qualities with equal aplomb. He tells it like it was (as he sees it, I'm sure), but if the accounts of his memories are even 50 percent accurate he has given the KISS fans a treasure trove of insight into the workings of the \\"Hottest Band In The World!\\" I for one applaud his effort to be honest even thoughhe clearly lashes out at his former band mates while complimenting their sucesses. He gives more than the expected amount of sex stories from the road, and I suppose that's what sells books of this nature to some people, but I was just a bit put off by his frankness overall in that regard.<br /><br />The book was well paced and formatted, which I imagine can be somewhat attributed to Pete's co-contributor Larry Sloman. The photo illustrations were numerous and largely appropriate for an autobiography of this sort.<br /><br />I was gifted this book for Christmas, but I liked it so much I bought another copy of it so Mr. Criss could benefit more from his work. That's how much I enjoyed reading it.<br /><br />Many thanks to Peter for his efforts on this book.
B005UZ1IJC|5.0|Aqualung stands the test of time and this new release certainly does it justice.  The added bonus tracks are fun as well, although it is the album itself that is still the star of this and most any other show.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|La compilación, la producción, la artista (¡por supuesto!). Se echa de menos que no dispongan de subtítulos en otros idiomas para las entrevistas y las intervenciones de Adele con el público
B003VANOFY|4.0|was hoping for better sound quality but it is what it is. Haven't met a wireless head set that could top Zalman  or Turtle Beach but I was hoping. They are good headphones don't get me wrong just not the best. Plus now my wife can't run over the cord and ruin 200 dollar head phones :)

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have been an avid reader of Cornwell's books.  Maybe that is why I have become so familiar with the main characters, who surround Kay.  I am tired and bored with them.  Her story was uninteresting and it seems like Kay and Patricia both have become neurotic.  I was very disappointed and think that to read another Cornwell book, I will go back and reread her earliest publications which were interesting and I enjoyed so much.  I don't recommend &#34;Bone Bed&#34;.

1451627297|1.0|1. All black people are victims? Pass.<br /><br />2. All wives are battered / abused? Pass with flying colors.<br /><br />3. Current president is doing great job? Pass. Smart man! When a nation descends toward Nazi Germany or Stalin's Russia, one doesn't go on record being critical of the Fuhrer.<br /><br />4. General liberalism preachy finger wagging sprinkled throughout? Yep.<br /><br />However... BIG fail on the grounds of suspension of disbelief. I can swallow a time \\"bubble\\" or whatever in the basement of a restaurant, but a world where the official story is the actual truth? Man, that is stretching things way too far. At least it's great to see King manning up, taking on the big bad wolf of the world: truthers and conspiracy types, in defence of the poor downtrodden governments. Way to rage against the machine there, man.<br /><br />The protagonist meanwhile is like Rambo meets Mother Theresa meets Jesus Christ meets (name of famous male porn star) meets... I dunno, Steinbeck himself, maybe. He is macho, he is romantic, he is great in bed, he is a tamer of the male chauvanist, gives no quarter even while being beaten senseless by gangsters, he is beloved by all who meet him... he is, why, he is KING HIMSELF!<br /><br />Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. A literary technique? Brainwashing? The point of it is...? Even in the afterword, we manage to get another dose of \\"the past harmonizes\\" and \\"the past is obdurate\\".<br /><br />However, one thing others have not mentioned about the hare brained plot, one thing that doesn't occur to the narrator (or even the author) is: so you go back and save Kennedy. You arrive back and two minutes have passed in real time. Have you considered that at any point in the future, someone ELSE might stumble across the steps leading to that basement, yes, in the restaurant building about to be purchased by a new company... and, oh I dunno, say in the process of cleaning the place up, moving new stuff in, inevitably walk down those same steps...and, oh, I dunno... RESET EVERYTHING THE PROTAGONIST IN THIS STORY DID?????<br /><br />That's enough King for one earthly lifetime, methinks.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|I was really enjoying this game and had over 200,000 points with a 24x multiplier. Two days ago, I logged on to play and my coins were gone and it started me back at the beginning with a 1x multiplier. I was in a tight race with my sister for the highest score and now that's ruined. :( It still shows my previous high score, but everything else started over.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is good right up until the last page. A thrilling read with the wrong ending. Would have been 5 stars if it had the right one.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I like the Fringe, its been quite entertaining. I will continue to watch the rest of the seasons to see where it takes them next.
B000URWYTS|2.0|There were some loopholes in the story that I wish had been addressed. The author left out some information that should have been included but for the most part the essentials were there. For a first novel, Horan did a good job and I learned so much that I never knew about Wright before. I'm very glad that our book club chose this book for this month.

B000E5N6LG|4.0|Kevin Costner is really good as Wyatt Earp.  Most stories about Wyatt Earp do not cover his entire life.  This one does. Doc Holliday had TB.  Dennis Quaid lost 40 pounds to play Doc Holliday.  No one does more for a film role than Dennis Quaid.  He puts his entire life force into every role he plays.  He actually jeopardized his health and became anorexic for a short while. Dennis Quaid as Doc Holliday is a tough, tenacious guy with a sense of humor.  Jim Caviezel is good as one of Wyatt Earp's brothers.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I first saw Downton Abbey when I came upon the last half of Episode 3/Season 3 on TV, and I knew then that I had to watch the first two seasons and &#34;catch up&#34;.  I found Season 1 on Netflix, but couldn't find Season 2.  I saw that Amazon had it and was very excited to find I was able to view Instant Videos of all episodes of Season 2 for FREE with my Amazon Prime.  What a great benefit of being a Prime member!  I am definitely hooked on this series.  The sound and video quality on my PC monitor was good, but I wish I could figure out how to get it on our 55&#34; 3D TV.  Only a couple of times did the connection drop but that was a minor glitch as the connection was restored and I was able to continue watching the show almost immediately.  Thank you Amazon!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was both funny and serious (more serious than I realized). I thought the actors did a great job. Well-written. Good movie to watch when you want a night in.

B008OW1S3O|5.0|Stumbled across these guys a few months ago and have listened to this cd so many times since then. It's such a crazy mix of weird and enthralling that you really can't stop listening to it!<br /><br />Give the full cd a listen, and put it on good speakers or use some great headphones. Even if you don't love it at first, give it a chance!
0765325950|4.0|Fitting conclusion to the almost two decade long series.  After many years of anticipation of this moment, can honestly say that I am glad the story is done.  Robert Jordan gave us some of the best times of our lives reading about the band of adventurers out of Two Rivers, but let us also admit that he lost his way and succumbed to greed and avarice in the middle volumes.  Beginning with Lord of Chaos ( is it 1996?) the story hit a brick wall.  Those that are old enough to remember Reader's Digest's condensed books,  the next 4 volumes are exceptional candidates.  Books 6 through 10 are literally, 1 - 1.5 volume's worth of adventuring, Really could not give a rats behind about laces and bodice trim's  of whichever woman's dress or skirt....<br /><br />As to this particular book, to be honest, many, many, of the plots were rushed (exception being the battle strategy), if you can say 900 pages of  material is rushing it... But in this universe, where some of the books, 6 - 10, again come to mind, spent entire volumes advancing a sub plot going into oblivion, yes this series finale is rushed.  And it shows.  For instance, Mat's confrontation with Fain, over in a handful of pages.  Almost to the point of why bother.... What about the prophecies of Logain's glory?  Saving some of the innocents at the end of the battle is it? Rather disappointing.  Egwene's end, rather sudden, too sudden for such a major player, no significant build up. Too bad about Faile, stuck up twit, did not like it that she made it back.  Rand's last Battle, do not want to say predictable, but also can with sincerity say, was underwhelming...<br /><br />Regardless, I have stuck with this series over the decades, now that it is put to rest.  I will re-read at my leisure and look for the foreshadowing, prophecies, and whatnot....<br /><br />Finally, this series has taught me to recognize when a writer decides to cash in, ala Geroge Martin.  No matter how tempted I have been in the last few years to buy the last two books, have resisted the temptation. Simply to avoid the frustration and endless meandering of the story line.  As in this series, the first installments where lights out above anything else int he SF/Fantasy landscape, but by the third book degenerated into t a money grab.  Back to Jordan's work, if you are like me, you have been reading the series since the early 90's, nothing anyone can write, shout, scream, etc. should stop you from picking this book up and enjoying Sanderson's take on the conclusion.  A fitting denouement.  Not too spectacular, but suitable.  Enjoy.<br /><br />Chris

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars.  &#34;Hopeless&#34; is unpredictable.  At first this book seems like it would be about two teenagers that fall in love, but it evolves into something much deeper and bigger then what you expect.<br /><br />This book is a must read for housewives!

B006LSZECO|1.0|The book grabs you right at the beginning but then throughout, you begin to dislike all of the characters.  Then I continued reading it because I wanted to find out how it will end but it just ends.  A lot of open questions.  Very unsatisfying.  I wish I hadn't read it now.
B0000X61VE|5.0|This work out works.  I like it because the moves are basic, powerful, and non-dancey.  There are 2 different work outs that I believe are 45 minutes long.  There is also a short 5 minute work out.  I recommend this work out.  You will see results and not be disappointed.  This work out will bring out all of your feminine curves.

B000W967UQ|5.0|This was my introduction to the Discworld series.  An entertaining little book, Mort is an endearing character that I became quickly invested in.  DEATH was very amusing to read about as well.  I love that Pratchett writes with a wink and a nod to all the absurdity that happens.  Yes this or that situation is absurd, but its amusing in its absurdity!<br /><br />I plan on continuing on with the Death series.  Reaping Man being next on my list

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|If you work within an IT organization, then this book does a good job of boiling down several management principles and making it clear how to apply them to running an IT organization correctly.  Along with DevOps, this book helps give IT professionals a story for how to properly run IT operations and the importance of development, operations, and security working together towards a common goal.  If you're not in IT, but on the business side, this book tells a story of how business decisions made without an understanding of IT can result in problems, and of what one should expect of one's IT organization.  There is still a story left to be told and that is how IT gets well integrated into supporting the business as a strategic partner, but that will have to be the next chapter. :-)
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you like your science fiction with a hard science base, you'll love this book.<br /><br />After being accidentally abandoned on Mars, an astronaut struggles to survive and contact Earth for help.

1416550534|4.0|The House at Riverton keeps a secret that burns in Grace's heart and soul. Grace has been a maid there for years since 1914. Now she's ninety-nine. She's been asked to meet a film producer, who is making a movie about the suicide of a famous poet at Riverton in 1924. It's going to be a blockbuster. A romantic film about the Hartford family and the two sisters who were there when the poet took his life. But only Grace knows the truth. Grace, the faithful maid, who grew up with the Hartford children, saw them through the war, their losses and survivals, became Lady Hannah's maid and the keeper of all her secrets even the biggest one.<br />It's a beautiful story. Gently written, page after page unfolding the story of a rich English countryside family through Graces's memory.<br />Touching, gripping, fascinating.
B00BECZPI0|1.0|I've brought a number of shows from amazon.  The $1.99 seems reasonable to get you back on track when you missed an episode.  To bad the current episode stops at the 24 second mark.  From other reviews looks like this is common.  Don't buy episode 9 if you missed it.  I'm sure amazon will fix or refund, it's just frustrating as I'm ready to watch right now.
0307386171|4.0|A story exactly the way the told me: sad.<br />Not the kind of sad to move you and make you cry nevertheless leaving a warm sensation in your heart. The kind of sad that tears your heart in two. The kind of unnecessary sad, but so true that you can feel the characters' desperation as if it was your own.<br />The honey moon night, a couple of newly-weds is waiting anxiously for that moment, so much dreamed but also still very much dreaded.<br />Silences, touching, thoughts completely different, but unsaid... and then a small \\"accident\\" that ruins everything.<br />Pride and also, as our modern psychologists would name it, the lack of communication start a quarrel made of hate, insults, angriness, but also desperation, sadness and a feeling of uselessness.<br />That night a knot comes loose, a love breaks, but it shouldn't necessarily be this way, it could be different... and in the end, after years and lives spent in other ways, remorse or better regret discover what anger and humiliation had so well hidden. Love never broke, it never ceased, but now it's too late and all we're left with are \\"ifs\\".<br />A small book (166 pages) that in its simplicity, but also through a perfectly chosen writing, it's not at all predictable and page after page the reader can feel the desperation caused by love's enemy number one: the unsaid (things)!

0060557818|4.0|Richard is a Scottish boy who, like many others, finds a good job in London. Everything is fine. Richard has some friends and even finds a beautiful girlfriend, who is very demanding. But he is a good fellow and he finds himself lead around by her like a nice little dog. One day something happens: Richard finds a badly hurt girl on the pavement while walking with Jessica, his fianc&egrave;. Nobody else seems to notice her. His engagement is in danger: either he leaves this girl to her fate and goes away with Jessica, or he'll lose her forever by helping a complete stranger. He takes a decision and it is the right one: he helps the girl. He doesn't know yet that he will not only lose his girlfriend but also his life like he has known it till then.<br />A new adventure starts for him and he finds himself catapulted into a very new world, that of London \\"below\\". Door, the girl he helped, has some strange power and a mission to accomplish: revenge, her entire family has been killed by someone for some unknown reason. Richard, who in the meantime turned into an invisible homeless soul in his world of \\"London above\\", is not getting much sympathy in London Below either. Two cold-blooded killers will try to stop Door and him to look for the only thing that could help them getting what they want: Door's revenge and Richard's old life. Will they succeed? Will Richard be able to get back to London Above leading a \\"normal\\" life? And what will he choose in the end?<br />An adult fairy tale, no doubt. The language and the descriptions are very violent and explicit. Of course it will suffice to say that it took me only four days to read it, to let you know how much this story kept me awake at night. I already read Stardust. I liked it but this one is wonderful!<br />It mixes up two different worlds (real and fantasy) so good to create a thouroghly suspenseful journey through imagination.<br />I loved the way he describes London and the tube. It made me go back in time when I was there. And it made me feel like taking the first plane to London and take the tube with this book, looking for all the characters and places of London Below.<br />A comment of \\"Wired\\" in this book says: \\"You'll never look at the tube the same way again.\\"<br />It would be a pity not to read it!!!And it made me feel like taking the first plane to London and take the tube with this book, looking for all the characters and places of London Below.<br />A comment of \\"Wired\\" in this book says: \\"You'll never look at the tube the same way again.\\"<br />It would be a pity not to read it!!!

0307744434|4.0|The night circus arrives unannounced and leaves unexpectedly. It is a peculiar circus, which opens at midnight and closes at dawn. To the eyes of a common spectator it would appear as an illusion of countless tents, each more mysterious than the other. Strolling around the circus he may find artists able to enchant his eyes, rob his attention, kidnap his imagination.<br />But the circus is more than that. It is a very strange family of all different sort of unrelated people, who never age and never leave for more than a short period at a time. Two twins are born on the night the never fading bonfire was lit and they seem to possess the strangest of the gifts, inherited from the magic atmosphere that surrounds the circus. What the common spectator does not know is that the circus itself is a game board. Two men, we would not be very wrong to call magicians, are watching a game they have once created, long time ago. Every single time there are two players involved, but only one can win. This time a young woman, whose magic is a inherited talent, trained hard and pitilessly by her father, and a young man, once an orphan, now a student to an equally cruel teacher as the young woman's father.<br />But though they have played this game with other players countless times already, they have never considered unforeseen difficulties such as love yet. While the two players grow up without knowing each other, they grow fond of their respective work in the circus, until they finally meet and realise the goal of this cruel game, but one thing they will learn together: even if there seems to be no way out, the future is never set in stone.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|By the time I had read nearly a third of the book....I thought I might just lay it down and be done.  I felt like I was reading the same material over and over....and actually re-read some of it.  I just couldn't get a handle on where this book was supposed to be taking me.  But then, all of a sudden, it took off and I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  And what a surprise...I would never had guessed the conclusion.

There are days when his mum is Gone. She just breathes but she's far away. Not many of such days mind you. Most of the times they're having fun.<br />One day his mum tells him the truth or better she unlies to him.<br />They're trapped inside this room and Old Nick is the one keeping them inside. Mum wants to escape and even though he doesn't like the plan, he has to do it. Jack will meet the Outside and everything that either scares him or makes him happy along with secrets and surprises.<br />It's a gripping story. Once you start you feel compelled to read on. It's tragic, funny, scary, warm. A mixture of feelings. A book that sinks in like a medicine. It tastes awful, but in the end it makes you feel better.

In this tragedy the boy loses his entire family and remains alone of his species on a lifeboat together with a hurt zebra, a shocked Orang-utan, a beastly Hyena and a Bengal Tiger, the latter who turns into his last companion, his greatest danger, but also his saviour!

The book obviously is better than the filmed version. The story is more complicated, but explains a lot of things that in the theatre are left untold. The reader understands more about the \\"Dust\\", more about the organisation called Church in the book and Magisterium in the film (because of years of battles by our beloved Vatican, that has nothing more important to do that feeling itself threatened by a children's book)!<br />The book goes further on with the story than the film.<br />Well I'm about to start with the second book \\"The Subtle Knife\\" (no idea of its name in theatres)!<br />This is my suggestion: first read the book (if you are really interested in the story), then watch it (it's surely very nice made on what concerns special effects and actors)!<br /><br />A Subtle Knife. I've spent the whole day reading these 325 pages, which made me so passionate chapter after chapter. My workmate told me this was a \\"holiday\\" book because you haven't to be bothered or stopped while reading it, but I didn't think it would have been like that... :-)<br />Anyway I see now why the church is so strongly against this book and I am quite sure that in the middle ages the same book would have been bunt at the stake together with the author! :-)<br />So... let's talk about the book, but I wouldn't like to spoil it for those who are reading it or plan to do it. In this story many \\"worlds\\" or \\"universes\\" get entangled together through many \\"windows\\". Among which there's also ours! There are basically two factions: those who want to put an army together to fight and destroy the \\"tyrant\\" (you would never guess who that is!!!) and those, who want to stop them with all their means. Lyra is the girl of the prophecy and in this book the prophecy is being told. Another kid, Will, is from \\"our\\" world and they are destined to help themselves, even though he has another important task to fulfil.<br />Lots of unexplained events come to an explanation and the reader discovers that many \\"explorers\\" have already discovered some of the other worlds. In the first book we leave the bears who fight to find other characters: the angels (those who rebelled so much time ago - take a look at the bible -), witches, strange spectres that suck the life out of the adults leaving them as zombies (not alive but not even dead). Evil people who seem to be good... others that one wonders are they simply mad or do they have a plan?<br />Anyway everything mixes and in the different worlds new human beings, new animals and new weathers meet...

1416550550|5.0|Breathtakingly splendid. One of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. Like when you find an old box hidden from an ancient time and when you open it what you find inside is a big treasure that warms your heart. This is the feeling now, as I finished this amazing book: warmth.<br />Three generations, one family secret. In 1913 a little girl is alone on a ship from England to Australia. A woman, the Authoress, told her to hide. She will be coming back soon for her and they will travel together. But the Authoress will never come back and the little girl will face her new future. In 1975 Nell, a middle-aged woman travels to England looking for answers. On her 21st birthday her father told her she was adopted and now she is looking for her real family. In 2005 Cassandra, after her grandmother Nell's death inherits a cottage in England, exactly where Nell's quest had started. Together with her grandmother's notes of the time she spent there, a couple of her childhood things (among which the Fairy Tales book by the same Authoress) she will slowly unveil the secret and find the truth about Nell's and her own past.<br />A page turner, definitely. A novel jumping from century to century never for once losing the thread of the plot. Fascinating the idea of include the Authoress' fairy tales into the story. The reader is compelled to finish it, because page after page a detail is discovered and like a very difficult puzzle, all pieces come together in the end.

The story in the book is, as usual, very different... but I can say that both are nice! The movie and the book!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|i love this game, its matching 3 or more together and it gives you bombs to help out when your stuck, it challenges you with putting chains around some of them and you have to match it up 2 and 3 times in order to get through. with the money you win you get to buy fish and decorations for a fish tank that can be used as a screen saver and you can just relax hear the water bubbles and the beautiful scene you created! i am telling you its an awesome game!!
B000FC10MU|4.0|Shadow is in prison. It won't be long now and he'll be a free man. His life out there is waiting together with his beloved wife, Laura. The day of the release, he's told that Laura died in a car accident. The world seems to stand still and he dies inside. Probably he was already dead, but he didn't really know it.<br />Alone and confused he meets Wednesday, a strange and mysterious man, who offers him a simple but dangerous job: he will have to drive him from place to place, he will have to hurt people, but only if it's necessary and should he die, he will held his vigil.<br />The storm's coming and together with it, a battle who will shed more than blood.<br />What Shadow doesn't know yet is that there are Gods in this world and they have been forgotten by those worshipers, who brought them to America a long time ago. And there are new Gods, modern ones, who want to take over the world and clean it from the old ones.<br />Shadow will learn this on his journey, and he will also learn that what we see is not always the truth. His adventure will show him life and death, wisdom and corruption, love and hate. He will find himself on this journey, but the price to pay for it will be high. Nothing will be the same again.<br />It's a long book, you will have to concentrate to keep track of all the Gods if you're not familiar with mythology. But it will be worth it. Enlightening, powerful, exciting. Gaiman never fails to surprise me and every one of his books is a precious fascinating work. Neverwhere is still my all time favorite though.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|A great album.  Mumford & Sons have a true passion for music & lyrics.  Their unique sound is inspirational, emotional, genius, yet simple.  I love their folky-rock sound.
B002V091IO|5.0|It's 1988, Emma and Dexter spend the night together after their graduation party. Both know that it's only going to be a one-night-stand. Nothing more, nothing less. Then suddenly we meet them again, year after year, that same day for twenty years. We meet them every year and we witness them growing up, apart but somehow always together. We fight the urge to slap Dexter in the face for being so selfish and narcissist and Emma for being so resigned to a shabby and anonymous life. Then they're slightly older and while Dexter seems to have hit the mark, being successful and famous, Emma is stuck in her dull life being beautiful and smart without knowing it. As Dexter's fall from grace begins, so starts Emma's awakening: Love seems to have found her; Dexter, on the other hand, is still changing sheets as quickly as he's changing his (nonexistent) underwear. The story goes on, I will not spoil the book for you, and the we, the readers, feel restless, almost begging for the timing to be right, year after year. We get angry, frustrated, sorry, happy and sad again. It's like watching painfully two people, who really want to see each other, getting off two separate trains on the same platform just a few minutes apart, enough not to meet each other. The author is describing life as it really is: unpredictable; Love as it really is: irrational and insecure; Fear as it really is: pulling us away from the only thing that could really make us happy. And then like in this Shakespear's Sisters song it dawns on you: 'Life is a strange thing. Just when you think you learned how to use it, it's gone'. Brilliant book, really.

0375826742|3.0|\\"A secret shared is no secret at all.\\"<br />\\"Anger is a poison. You must purge it from your mind or else it will corrupt your better nature.\\"<br />These, together with the many other quotes I have already mentioned, make of this book a wise adventure, which reminds that of Frodo and his quest to destroy the ring!<br />It took me long to read this book because I had so many things keeping my mind busy that I couldn't really concentrate on the story.<br />When I finished it I was surprised! I thought this was the last book of the trilogy, but it's no trilogy at all and there's a fourth book coming! Well, so I can't tell you much apart from the fact that after some fights, a teaching session and a new weapon... Eragon, Saphira and their friends will have to endure one more challenge: fighting and destroying Galbatorix.<br />(I have to say I must fight a smile everytime I read this name, because it reminds me of Asterix... I can't really see him as the scary and bad king, who must be defeated! I mean... he's no Dark Lord Sauron...).<br />So... you and I will have to wait for the fourth book!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It's a easy read,  a must buy if you have read other Two. Can't wait for the movie to come out. Read it in one day.
038572179X|4.0|A book that does not leave you alone. After a tiresome start in the novel and the unexpected event, the story would love to be read all at once to quickly know how it ends!<br />A terrible unjustice ruins the life of a good boy and his rather short love story with the daughter of the man, who is helping him building up his future. After prison, another tragic event comes to worsen his life: the war. His beloved, who in the meantime has completely detached herself from her family, promises to wait for him. The young man tries to survive for her sake. While the actual author of this negative events in his life, will have all her life to atone for her appalling mistake.<br />Without doubt one of the most beautiful and tragic love stories I have read.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|Our daughter wanted this for her birthday. Overall, it is well made. The zippers can be hard for her to do on her own at 6yo so you may want to consider that.  But it is a great storage option that is lightweight, can be played with and folds flat. That's hard to find so that is a definite plus for this product.
030771652X|5.0|A masterpiece. I know someone will look at me and tell me I'm exaggerating my rating, but I'm not. It's a compulsive story. It is. A strange kind of emotional thriller. It starts with Beatrice writing to her sister Tess. A letter full of love, regret, fear. It's only after a couple of pages that the reader realises the truth: Tess is dead. The letter goes on till the point where Beatrice \\"writes\\" that she has found out who murdered her and she will tell her, not now, but she will tell her the whole story.<br />The narration of a beautiful love story starts. The story of two sisters, a bound held together by closeness, love, affection. Only a person capable of such a love can go through such torture to try and prove that the sister she's been knowing better than anyone, the sister she has shared such a strong family tragedy with, the sister who is so much different from her, would never be able to commit suicide. Beatrice unfolds the story of a youth marked by the loss of a very loved brother through cystic fibrosis, the strong bond between two sisters who not only lose a brother but whose father also leaves them to start a new life. She paints her sister's character in such a way that the reader almost knows Tess as if she's still alive. She describes the last months of her sister, how she found out she was pregnant by a man, who would have never be part of her life. How, even though alone in so many ways, she managed to surround her life with so many beautiful people. Her child's diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and a trial, a new miraculous cure, to give her hope. But somewhere down the line something went wrong and like a castle made of sands a tide came and swept everything away. Leaving grief and sorrow and a hole in Beatrice's heart and life. The battle of a sister to find out the truth, even if nobody believes her (not even her own mother), even by risking her life. A story of love, of tenacity, of courage, of hope. Deeply moving: I hardly could keep tears from rolling every time I opened the book. Strongly irritating: I felt the urge of slapping the policeman. Greatly heart warming: I don't know what it's like to have a sister, but I so much felt with Beatrice and her sorrow, her beautiful memories of her sister. I am well aware I cannot find the right words to put it down. On the cover: \\"You're missing. I'm coming to find you... SISTER\\".<br />What else? You must read it.olling every time I opened the book. Strongly irritating: I felt the urge of slapping the policeman.

B004H8GLXQ|4.0|I will tell you a story about twins! I will tell you a ghost story!<br />That's how Vida Winter starts his real story. The one she'll tell Margaret Lea, a biographer. The real story, the one all journalists have tried to extort from her without succeeding.<br />I won't tell you more.<br />Absorbing.<br />This book is indescribably fascinating and it's going to haunt you till the end.<br />Don't miss it!
B00AQCMK32|4.0|This was a fun game, but it was too repetitous for me. It was my first Kairosoft game. I am starting Dungeon Village and initally, this seems to be more engaging.
140130916X|4.0|The book:<br />Holly and Gerry always made a joke about the fact that in case Gerry should die, Holly wouldn't be able to know how to go on living. \\"I'll write you a list\\" Gerry would say laughing and she'll laugh too. This list also became a famous joke among their best friends. When Gerry dies of brain cancer, Holly's world stops. Until the day she finds the \\"list\\". Gerry really left her instructions, in a kind of weird way: a letter a month (10 months to say a proper \\"farewell\\") teaching her how to \\"survive\\" and then how to \\"get back to life\\".<br />A romantic book without any doubt, but it doesn't plunge you into sadness or desperation. Typically Irish, the author tells us the story of a tragedy, but never forgets to make us laugh... and never forgets to give us hope.<br />I read it constantly with tears in my eyes... at times because I was so deeply moved and at times because of how hard I was laughing.<br />A big love story yes, but above all a great story about true friendship and hope!!!<br />I couldn't stop the tears in the end.<br />Cecilia Ahern, after Marian Keyes is surely one of my favourite Irish authors!<br />It was fun to read about the girls going through Dublin... Grafton Street and Stephen's Green are still very present in my heart not to mention Galway, which I hopelessly fell in love with!!!<br />Read it!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|As my title states, it is just this. It is done very well and I love playing this game. The music is awesome, the controls are very well done, and the monologue between characters is funny and gets you involved in the story. It has lots of replay value.
0312427646|4.0|About this book one can only say: very funny and entertaining! It's about a very uncommon reader, the Queen, who one day discovers the pleasure of reading. She discovers that reading opens the gates to very different worlds, makes you learn so much about authors, persons and their lives that would be very difficult to discover even by knowing them personally (which she does in most of the cases). There are also the well known games among the private secretaries of both the Queen and the Prime Minister, who can't stand this new \\"passion\\" of hers, it's no hobby (like she says, the Queen can't afford to have a hobby). So she has to fight these subtle manoevres to holding her far from books. But what if books are not enough? What if she feels the duty of writing? This could be even more dangerous. The end is unpredictable and very funny. A book to read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is awesome it is so fun!!! it is the best game ever I play it all the time I can not stop it is ADDICTING
0060853972|5.0|According to The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, the world will end next Saturday. Anathema, her descendant, a witch, and the previous descendants did a good job in deciphering her somewhat unclear prophecies. And it's going to be Saturday. Crowley, the demon and Aziraphale, the angel, have been living on earth since the beginning, getting used to the 'humans' and their lifestyle. Therefore they're not really looking forward to the end of all this. When the Antichrist is placed on earth in the form of a baby, living in a common British family, they decide to take action. But contrasting The Master Plan is not an easy task. The war between Good and Evil has already started and the Armageddon is approaching. The four Apocalyptic Horsepersons, ehm bikers, are driving on the motorway on their way to fulfill God's and Satan's plan. How can an old witch hunter, a psychic lady and a young clerk help?<br />Refreshingly funny, magically entertaining, cunningly written by two of the best British fantasy authors around. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is the best its like temple run but alot better! its really addicting! I really recommend this game
0380807343|5.0|Coraline loves to explore. She gets bored at home when she can't go out, so when her parents tell her to explore the house on a rainy day, that's what she does. Unfortunately she discovers a door, which apparently hides a wall, but in reality it's a secret passage to another world. Could she ask for more than exploring a brand new world? But what she'll see and whom she'll meet out there is really creepy. The problem is that escaping this place isn't as simple as entering it. She will have to gather all her courage and cleverness to save herself, the people she loves the most, three little new friends and a cat! I loved this story.

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This makes you wonder whether there is a Vector Threat in todays world of communication security.  This makes you realize how vulnerable computers are.  Lots of action and heavy on the details which is typical in a Tom Clancy novel.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|Good film taking an innovative idea, an original short story, and making a full detailed plot.  Did have a little taste like Forrest Gump, but I liked the acting, the setting, and the directing.  Nothing over-the-top which I appreciate.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This novel was well written with emotions that were at time overwhelming for the problems the heroine endured.  I loved the tricks and turns of the author to keep wanting the reader to turn the page.  I loved this book so much I had all my girlfriends order it too.  Just fascinating.
B00913DPW2|5.0|We have played many of the hidden object games and they are OK. This game has a great story line and it has some good scary parts. Not good for the little ones. I enjoy this type much more than the games you are constanly searching for a list of items.

B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Richard Dawkins does a good discussing how life without religion is not only a bad thing, but something that should be embraced. He does a great job of not only covering the scientific aspects of secularism;  but also the psychological, social, historical, and philosophical ones as well. For me there were certain parts that were somewhat dry, but very educational nonetheless.<br /><br /> If you are questioning your faith, this book is a good start to help answer some questions you may have. The best part is at the end of the book there's contact info to help out with that as well as other recommended books. Overall, this was a great and informal read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Needed something to read on a long flight and with no time to choose reading material I accepted The Hunger Games from the sales clerk.  So glad I did! Purchased complete series on my way home from air port!  Just finished last book and disappointed there isn't more. Highly recommend to anyone.

B000P6PVLC|1.0|So many mistakes! Not a single one of the three / four ??? story lines is convincing. The connections are forced and weak.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I've had Yahoo! Mail for about a decade.  I have the premium service that costs $19.99 annually.  I used to be a big fan, in part because if I have a problem, a live person gets involved and helps me solve it.  But now that live person is in another country and apparently has incentives to get my issue of his or her plate as quickly as possible using standard responses that many times don't apply.  This results in many back and forth exchanges with me growing increasingly frustrated as various people respond, one after another, until finally someone either closes the ticket without my agreement or actually solves the problem.<br /><br />There are also ongoing problems with the Calendar.  I have missed several appointments which I know I put on the calendar, but they later disappeared.  I'm guessing this is because they had to restore the calendar from an older version before I put the entry in.  It happens quite frequently that I can't get into the calendar at all.  Sometimes I get an error message, other times a blank screen.  If it wasn't such a hassle, I would have switched to google mail a long time ago.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was not really what I was expecting-I heard great reviews about it but I do not agree.  The reason I kept reading was because I was waiting for it to get better.  A little overboard and not the type of thiller I was expecting.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|What else do they want me to say? we love this movie and wanted it so we bought it and it is just as we wanted.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a good continuation of the first temple run. They made it a little more scenic and interesting and kept the moves the same. If ya liked the first one, you will like this temple run.<br />update: ehh the game got very glichy and unplayable had to re-install several times.  this could also be my piece of crud droid 3 so i cant take off any stars, but look out if it skips on you just uninstall and re-install.

B007EECSFA|5.0|MY FIRST COMMENT IS THAT \\"THE SECRET KEEPER\\" WAS A WONDERFUL STORY!!!  In 2012 I read Kate Morton's \\"Distant Hours\\" which, to me, was a lengthy, dreary, boring book; nevertheless, I read \\"DISTANT HOURS\\" to the very end.  At Christmas when my husband bought \\"The Secret Keeper\\" for me, I was not thrilled.  The thing is...I am not a patient reader, so if a book has not grabbed my attention within the first 100 pages, I'm ready to toss it and start another book.  Since this book was a gift from my husband, I was determined to read it to the end.  \\"The Secret Keeper\\" took 193 pages to really hook me into the story. The story became fascinating and intriguing, and by the last 100 pages of \\"The Secret Keeper,\\" Kate Morton's twists and turns in her story totally convinced me that this was one of THE BEST AND MOST EXCITING BOOKS I had ever read. I loved \\"THE SECRET KEEPER!\\"

B007HACDLK|5.0|One of the better Mitch Rapp books. Interesting detail, and I love how it is with the times of the days.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 has all the action of the first Temple Run, but adds a few new features. After you complete 2,000 in one game, you get to play a mine cart game. It is hard at first, but like any other aspect of hte game, you get better with practice. The crazed monkey/bird things that followed you previously are now only 1 larger creature, and it pops up whenever you trip and do not die from crashing. It can make the path harder to see, but goes away afer you survive 250 and do not trip again. This version also has several turns that are harder to see initially as being turns, so I died a lot.<br /><br />Actually, this game not only keeps my kids' attention (all age levels 3 - 15), I enjoyed playing it. The only negatives for me are the permissions and in-app purchases. However, being free, I expected in-app purchased, so I am willing to put up with that, especially since I password protect purchases anyways. The permissions are needed for the Amazon games listings, but I really don't think that is necesary. Overall, very worthwhile download.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Was a good read once it actually got to the point. The author is wordy and very descriptive, which made it hard to get into the book at first.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I have only seen a couple episodes of this season, and like the first season, it is a well made show.  Although the two seasons have nothing in common in terms of plot, story, or characters, many of the same actors and actresses appear in the second season, playing new roles which allows you to see them in a different light.  I thought this was a very interesting and original concept for a series to take on, particularly one of such quality as this.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Boarded up rest stops is a good place where high-school kids drink and too often get into trouble.<br />In Mile 81, a rest stop that has been closed for a long time is where ten-year-old, Pete Simmons, goes when he knows his older brother is looking for him. Pete likes playing at the boarded up rest stop. (As a young kid, I often played paratroopers bombing my siblings with mud balls from the high bar ditches.)  Be that as it may, back to my review: Pete finds a bottle of vodka in the boarded up hamburger joint at the closed rest stop. You guessed it, the young boy just has to sample the vodka and drinks until he passes out.<br />Soon, a mud-covered station wagon pulls into the rest stop. The driver's side door opens up, but nobody gets out. Could the owner of the station wagon be having car trouble?<br />As luck would have it, an insurance salesman sees the station wagon. He pulls into the closed rest stop to help the driver of the station wagon. Right away, he notices there are no license plates on the station wagon.<br />Within minutes, a guy pulling a horse trailer sees the station wagon and a Toyota 'Prius' parked at the closed rest stop. He pulls off the highway to help what he believes are stranded motorists.<br />Pete wakes up from his vodka knockout. He is very surprised to see over a half-dozen vehicles at the boarded-up rest stop, as well as two kids and a horse. What happened to everyone else?  If you know Stephen King, then you can perceive this is going to be a thrilling, scary ride for everyone who stops at the Mile 81 rest stop. It could be a stop where they take a very long rest.<br /><br />Jeannie Walker - Award Winning Author - \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Fringe is a really interesting show.  It uses many new and original ideas and is one of the few shows that has had me baffled at some point or another.  I would suggest watching the first two seasons before tackling this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is awesome  and fun I had a good weekend playing this  it feels like you have a real horse
0374214913|3.0|I thought this book would be more of a fantasy adventure/mystery.  It sort-of was, but it was more about things that can be done, or maybe will be able to be done,  with modern computer technology.  It bored me after a while, but I finished it just to see the outcome.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This back pack is amazing, all of my video equipment fits in the pack.  It has good cushioning for all of your equipment and fits comfortably on your back.  Build quality seems good, I've only been using it for a month so I'll have to see how it holds up after 6 months.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This series is tiresome and should be stopped.  It was hardly scary as stand alone movie, and added little to the story line, if anything.  This movie was so boring that I instead talked to my girlfriend about our work day through the whole thing.

B003O86FMW|2.0|book 2 is filler between book 1 and book 3. i imagine movie 2 will be filler between movie 1 and movie 3.<br />book 3 and book 1 are good.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love this app, but I am having trouble with it saving my completed puzzles.  Is anyone else having a problem or do you know how to solve it.?  I will solve the puzzles and then before I know it they show up again unsolved.  I keep doing the same puzzles over again.  I only have trouble with it saving on the expert level.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book was great for my homework and had very accurate definitions . I recommend it for anyone who needs the actual definition of a word
B008D28HYS|5.0|My absolute favorite thing to do.  I played a free version of regular CrossMe and loved it, so when I saw they had the color version I paid $4.99 and it was worth every penny.  Best app ever.
B003M70O5O|4.0|Never thought a show about a biker gang would get my attention...I was wrong.  The story line is captivating and the writing is solid.  I really like this show.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Enjoyed Dawn of the Dinosaurs very much. as well the first two.  I can't look at Raymond anymore without thinking of these movies.  Good match.
B0079R8KO0|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised that this cover looks very smart. I work in the professional arena and I get a lot of positive comments about my cover. People ask where I got it and they always assume I paid a lot for it. It sets the Kindle at a great angle for taking notes in meetings or just serving the web. Would definite​ly recommend this cover to friends.
B005LAIISA|3.0|The first 3 &#34;Ice Age&#34; sagas were delightful.  Continental Drift dropped the ball.  Story line? boring, too many characters and the seemed to be missing the plot.  Where was this supposed to go?  Maybe it's time to give it up.
B0053TWVDC|5.0|I absolutely love the Children of the Corn movies. I would recommend them to everyone. Another great addition to my collection of movies.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Awesome documentary; really enjoyed their stories about guitar as a way of life!<br />Definitively recommended for guitar fans!<br />Jimmy is fantastic even with a grey hair
B009AMALGM|5.0|This is the best one yet of this collection! This one will creep you out for sure!!!! I recommend it for everyone!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You have to read the third book of the Hunger Games. It was good.  It quite what I expected through the whole book. But that is what makes it so good.
B002SSUQFG|1.0|This watch broke only after a few months and the buyer would not contact me. Is a waste of money.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This edition has been enthralling my children and grandchildren for decades...not to mention the old cronies like me....like The original source Jungle Book (Kipling,R.) it wil never be outdated!
B00101ZOTK|5.0|Taut, Suspenseful, Cerebral, well-acted ....<br /><br />I loved Kevin Spacey and Chazz P as they walk us thru the entire story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the book.  I am interested in the after life.  Yes, recommended it to a friend.  Gives me hope
B008XG1X18|5.0|Works great with my Kindle which is what I got it for.  So I am good to go!  I love Pinterest
B008KRJWEK|5.0|This game is alot like the console game RAGE. It has a variety of cars and its always fun running over mutant with a military jeep. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for the hybrid of a zombie killing and racing.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I bought this so I could put it on google using my television. They've made it so convoluted, if I get around to -I'll tell you what I think.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|if you looking for a series that will suck you in with scenes that will feel like a fist to the gut thats the one for you.<br />unique prespective photography wise, the camera &#34;runs&#34; with the actors makes you feel you are part of the team combined with no artificial soundtrack!!<br />its a true masterpieace
B000BCE918|3.0|This entire set is basically Jaws with dinosaurs instead of sharks.  If a player is not a well known actor in any of these movies, expect to see him eaten by the dinosaurs.  These movies are exciting to watch and the special effects are first-class,  but the viewer will know who will survive from the start of the movie.  The viewer is there to see how the minor characters meet thier demise and how the major characters survive.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If I am wondering what the characters are up to long after I have finished the book, then it was a good book.  This book did just that.  I finished it several days ago, and still find myself thinking about the characters.  I would recommend it.  It had some unexpected twists and was well written.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|The best part about this app is how much I liked it and how good it was. Hopefully, someday, something even better will come along.<br />Review for app meets minimum word requirements.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Proof of nothing, really. An intriguing experience, to be sure, but perhaps the author's brain-surgeon mentality will not allow him to admit it could have been caused by some aspect of brain physiology that we just do not understand. He essentially says, &#34;It couldn't have been caused by my brain, so it had to be a real look at heaven.&#34; That's not even good science.
0765325950|5.0|*******************This review does not contain any spoilers...read without worry!!****************************<br /><br />I started reading WOT when I was 16 years old, 18 years ago.  It has always been close to my heart.  In Rand, Matt and Perrin I found three characters who I loved and treasured and who became a part of my life in a way no other characters ever have.  The kind of characters that are so real and vibrant that you feel like they are friends you grew up with since you were a small child.<br /><br />When Robert Jordan passed away, I was shattered.  I thought that I would never find out how the series ended, and it was a painful feeling.  When I heard that Brandon Sanderson, a writer unknown to me, would finish the books, I was worried.  I am a big Dune fan, and read all the books by Frank Herbert.  For those of you who know the story, he also passed away without finishing his epic, legendary series.  Later they found a manuscript in a safe deposit box, and it was decided that his son would finish the series working from that manuscript.  I was so excited - I bought the book the first day it came out.  Ten pages into I realized that something was very very wrong.  The writing style was wholly unlike that of his father.  The work was of an inferior quality - like that of a child compared to a true craftsman.  It was horrifying.  Not only was this book terrible, Brian Herbert kept releasing more and more of these fake Dune books.<br /><br />From that experience I learned that it is best not to know how a series ends, than to see it destroyed by a lesser hand.  And so, when I heard that another author would finish WOT, albeit from notes left by Jordan, I was filled with trepidation.  This didn't improve when I heard that the one book was turning into three.  It sounded too much like a money-spinner.  It was with pleasant surprise then that I read A Gathering Storm.  The book was well-paced, and while it was not 100% in Jordan's style, it was certainly close enough not to matter to me.  The plot was advanced and the excitement was back for me.  I'm not one of those people who hated books 7-11, I thought they were all brilliant, even though some were ostensibly slower.  But it is obvious that, whether by design or not, A Gathering Storm moved things forward at a more rapid pace.<br /><br />The same could be said for Towers of Midnight.  An excellent book, which tied up threads that had been hanging for many many years.  The scene was set.  Still, I found myself a little nervous when I finally received A Memory of Light.  This would be the book that capped off one of the most important series I have read.  Would it be satisfactory?  Would it be true to Jordan's vision?  How would I feel when all was said and done?  I can tell you now, in a word, jubilant.  I loved this book - more even that the last two.  I think Brandon Sanderson did an amazing job under very trying circumstances, and I think all of us have a lot to thank him for.  I never felt that he let his own ego intrude.  Instead, he let the story flow, the events unfold, and the characters speak for themselves.  Gone is the akwardness when he writes Mat's point of view.  In fact, Mat in this book is at his side-splitting best.  Rand and Perrin are exactly the way I remember them when Jordan was writing, there is nothing jarring or out of character.<br /><br />With regards to the plot, I have seen a lot of reviews were people complain about the fact that the book is essentially 900 pages of battle.  To them I can only say, WTF?  How can you complain about that?  When Jordan wrote at a slow, measured pace, setting up every last little detail and crafting the situations, they complained.  Now that we have a relentless, bruising, violent, breathless page-turner, they complain.  Not enough dialogue!  Not enough philosophy!  Please - this book is exactly what I wanted, and it is exactly what this series needed, and it is exactly what Jordan had been aiming for when he started writing this series.  It is intense, it is crazy, it is dense, it will grab you by the throat and not let go until you read the last word.  And even then, days and weeks later, you will keep coming back to the end in wonder and joy.<br /><br />My son is nine months old now, and I can't wait until he is old enough so we can start reading the Eye of the World together, and I can introduce him to this beautiful, magical series.  And that will be, not THE beginning, but another beginning.  Thank you Robert Jordan, for starting this amazing series, and creating these beautiful characters.  Thank you Brandon Sanderson, for staying true to his vision.<br /><br />(As a short aside, I have noticed that many people give this book one star based on the fact that the kindle version was not released along with the hardcover one.  I understand the frustration; I live in Taiwan, and though I own a kindle I had to order the hardcover and have it shipped all the way here.  This is not a good way to do business, and I hope Amazon will exert more pressure on publishers who do this in the future.  However, I see no reason to punish an excellent book based on a decision by the publisher...thus, five stars it is.)e started writing this series.

B000C13Y2S|5.0|This product was a gift for a friend who is a handyman and he has certainly enjoyed it.  They were supposed to send me instructions but never did
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Is recommended highly by me,suspenseful and written with such passion that surpasses all realms of how far one would go for love. This is truly an amazing story, can not wait to see<br />Where Eva and Gideon go from here.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|One of the timeless classics.  Robert Redford and Paul Newman were a perfect team.  We could watch this film over and over again :)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book.Great beginning.<br />had me on the edge of my seat.<br />Was a fun read. everyone at work had read it
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Probably one of the best blu-ray packages ever, excellent video quality, and has more extra features than one can possibly handle. Come with every version of each film out there. If you love the Alien films then this is a must buy.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love the Angry Birds Series.<br />Learned how to play by a 3 year old.<br />He is great at the Angry Birds.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|I was a long time fan of JAG and very disappointed when it ended.  I finally started watching NCIS and find the same great writing and engaging characters.<br />With so much junk on TV, I can say, these guys get it right.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|what can I say got thru all three.<br />couldn't wait til the end.<br />was a fun read. loved the end
B0054EU0H0|5.0|These protectors worked well. They fit like they should.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for screen protectors
B007IXWKUK|5.0|got thru 1 which was great.<br /> read on Kindle fire. Was able to transfer to phone.<br />enjoyed EL james .
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've played Minecraft on the pc, xbox, and now on my kindle. This app runs so smooth that it's worth every penny. I can throw some relaxing music on Spotify and drift into my own land with Minecraft PE..it's well worth your time because it's so easy to pick up and play anywhere. If you don't need to play online with full features and mods, then just pick this up for a great individual experience...unless you can LAN with your friends...<br /><br />Maybe the developers will add servers. I'm sure it would take a lot of work to get all these devices online, but it would be the only update this game needs.<br /><br />Overall, this is worth your money if you have or haven't played other versions of Minecraft. Especially for the creative of heart. Hope this helps.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love love love  this game.<br />Addictive. Played with Grandson.<br />this game will make you go crazy trying to not run into the trains.<br />Fun fun fun
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I would actually call this one a game. It keeps you interested and has more than two minutes of game play. You can customize the horse, but it is limited to the mane and tail unfourtunately.
B004SBX112|5.0|Taught to play by 3 year old grandson.<br />this is fun and keeps my brain running on high trying to beat the highest score.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|Very funny book because it has to be the best book in the world.<br /><br />Needs to be a new classic.
1609611543|5.0|Very detailed directions with lots of options to satisfy almost everyones mood. I do wish this book had alternatives for those who are gluteen free.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Ok so he's not afraid to kill off some characters, but boy he keeps you on the edge of your seat page after page... Love it! Give me more!!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Everyone should see this movie. I saw the cover and waited to purchase as it is not what I gravitate toward, but saw it and passed it on to many to watch. I see why it had everyone talking and being shown everywhere. We need more movies like this today. Thank you, Alex Kendrick and crew!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Still learning but seems pretty fun at the moment. Interactive. For all those horse lover's out there. Pretty sure it will end up being very addicting as well.
B003QSMC18|3.0|I rate Disney's The Princess and The Frog 5 stars; however, I rate Amazon's execution of playing the movie 1 star because the movie stopped/skipped too much.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No issues with rethinking this purchase. I do love the series so far and I a pretty sure it will remain the same until the last session.
B004UPALT6|5.0|A great sequel that is a must see for any horror film buffs and especially anyone who has seen the first.
B008XCJ03K|3.0|I feel that this is an OK production, that could have been done much better to be top in my list.
B001AITGWE|5.0|This film is better each time I see it, flaws and all. Gets you thinking about economic viability and vigilante justice.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I loved the way all of the pieces of the story were told between present and past.  What a nice twist that both Vivien & Jimmy survived both with happy but separate lives.
B002N44XSG|5.0|Anna Beth is daughter of Athena the goddess of wisdom. I think that Percy needs that. This book is a guide to demi-god's world. It also shows that Percy needs wisdom.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a book this much since the Harry Potter series.  It has everything.  Love, romance, mystery and a magical world.
B005LAII80|5.0|The antithesis of a &#34;chick flick&#34;, this movie is incredible in 3D! This isn't Stallone's Judge Dredd. This is something worth adding to your 3D collection! The &#34;Slow-Mo&#34; shots are beautiful and incredibly graphic at the same time, making the 3D experience just incredible! Although there are a few shots that pander to the 3D, it is not something you see throughout the whole movie, and other shots that aren't pandering, still look good as well. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone wanting a good action flick and ESPECIALLY to anyone wanting to add on to their 3D collection!
B002OSAT7U|3.0|I guess I didn't review the samples enough before buying this entire album, since although about a third of the tracks really work for me, the rest kind of fall flat and seem repetitive and without spirit. But I don't fault the artist... I just didn't shop carefully enough this time.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have the Kindle Fire and the eBay app is amazing. I can check everything from it, my bids, messages, items Im selling, etc. I would recommend this to anyone who uses eBay on a regular basis.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first when I started  this book I thought to myself that I picked another stereotypical hot, dangerous guy falls in love with shy girl novel and was pretty disappointed but this book was so much more! The author takes the time to develop the characters and the relationship between them that it feels so genuine and much more mature than a high school relationship. There was so much more to the plot than just the typical hot guy falls in love with shy girl which I really appreciated and also made it a page turner. Good book!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Its the best scfi on TV.  Each episodes are well connected  so you just cant stop watching it. Good JoB Fringe team
B004EPYZU8|4.0|Folks watch this for a lot of reasons - gaming themes, eye candy ... but the story is great too, so also is the narrator's comments--at the beginning and end--which are otherwise left out to keep the story's illusion layers at play.  Wish the DVD had better special features
0525953728|2.0|I usually enjoy first hand accounts of this type but this was too quick and predictable. Loved 'My War' by Colby Bryant  much better.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This movie was a lot more about a person's struggles with drugs and alcohol than about flying, a plane crash, or anything else.  I was hoping to watch an exciting, action packed movie based on the description - and it was for the first 20 minutes or so.  After that it was more a drama than anything else.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I absolutely love Gillian Flynn's writing style. Her characters are developed to the point that you feel like you know them personally. This book has a gruesome act but the intrigue as to who committed this act lasts throughout the entire story. If you are a fan of this genre, you will not be disappointed. Gone Girl is one of my favorite reads and Dark Places is right there with it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Thank you so very much Chris for your patriotism, service and dedication to our Nation. Also, I want to say thank you to Chris's family for all of their true sacrifice as well. I purchased the book and started reading it. The next day I learned he left us. Our nation has lost a true hero. MayGod bless both Chris Kyle and his family!<br />I especially enjoyed this book. I really enjoyed the added comments from his wife. It gave us a small glimpse into the sacrifices made and the daily stresses of soldiers and their family's see daily!
B007RTAR64|5.0|She just smiled at it when she opened it for Christmas. Katness is a hero of hers, so much so she went as Katness on Halloween. She is 5 years old. Her mom told her not to open it but I told her to crack that thing open and play with it until the paint fell off.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Didn't like the plot that much compared to past MI films. Special effects and setting were a bit contrived as well. Just an average action film. Expected a bit more from the budget and franchise.
0312576463|3.0|This is a good book, definitely had page-turning events and i am not quite finished but am glad i ordered it - Different and quirky set of characters.
B00797MB0O|3.0|It had its OK moments, but the script was lackluster. The actors did a good job, but the plot failed to hook you much and a lot of the &#34;twists&#34; were predictable.
0321687299|4.0|Although there are abundant resources on HTML5 online, this covers the newly introduced elements with useful, practical examples, making fair comparisons with pre-HTML5 elements.
B0063GORYU|4.0|would like to be able to track which games I have played and the scores. but still a fun game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|i loved it so much.i wish that it could be a video game for playstations and wiisor other things.loved it
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I personally love this game and would love the dull version. although I think that 5 dollars is a lot to pay for a game. I would definatley get it if it wasn't so much. but u get to play a lot before you have to pay for it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All three books were great I love them very suspenseful and erotica;-) i was very pleased. I hope to see more to add to the story
B001AQO3QA|5.0|All movies include both their Theatrical Releases and their Special Editions. Hundreds of extras, a must have for Alien fans.
1401322786|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Heard lots about it on television.  I recommend it and will be offering it to my friends and family.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Wanted a calculator on my Kindle, this one did the trick.  It's a calculator, how can you go wrong with this ap.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found it a little hard to get in to, but after about the second chapter i was hooked. It is not for everyone, but i loved it and it kept me wanting more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series was a little slow in the first couple episodes, but since the we have been hooked.  Such a great show. Great characters and great story lines.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers will always be popular! I like how it's on a world tour it's kind of fun to guess where it will be going next! I give this game a thumbs up!!!
B009VL299E|5.0|Awesome Set. Tons of new stuff with all the hits. Great effects as well, plus killer sound. A must have for any fan.
0765367297|5.0|Halo fans if your looking for a great book and the beginning of master chief's story this a book i recommend.
B00005B1W7|5.0|Excellent  saw this movie many years ago. It is never on tv so I really enjoyed it. Very very good
B0098XY5VK|5.0|We love this game, the fact that you have to be fast and correct makes it interesting. I gave it 5 stars maybe I should have given it 4. The only thing I don't like too much is if you use the mouse, it makes it slower, but still love the game. Great on Kindle or tablet.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun game so far, but is a little slow to start.  Could do with a few more mini games or quest in the beginning.
0345529057|2.0|This is not a reflection on the writing, only on the printed books. They are terrible. The pages come out and the the cover rips easily. In the quest to cash in on the popularity of the tv series, they really raced to the bottom with this set. Try to find a book that was printed before the tv series and it will probably be better quality
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Some music never gets old. I would include this album in that group. It is a nice album to listen to from beginning to end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Different from anything I've ever read....and better!  THh story thrilled me and fills me with hope.  The author is credible and the story is REAL.  I am giving it to several family members and friends.  It is not religion-based, but other-worldly in a tangible way.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a.awesome game no doubt about it. Since ver. 0.6.1.more zombies at night, new blocks, clouds, armor, and more blocks. Once when I was playing I herd a zombie an it scared me so much because before I never herd a zombie scream I was scared because I was it bedrock and zombies are usually at the surface.<br /><br />P.S. bedrock is breakable in creative mode.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|The basic premise is simple enough for my 4-year-old, but getting 3stars on every level takes me several tries a lot of times.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|kids loved it, one of there fave. i highly recomend watching with the kids on family movie night. would rent again.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|This is one of the greatest concert DVDs of all time. It's too bad that it's not in Widescreen format or even better HD.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|i really liked the movie, wished there was more action but for the most part had a great story. love the cast.
B00A2IUDO8|3.0|This really isn't a hard movie to review, I am not sure why there seems to be such a divergence of opinion in the hundreds of other reviews.<br /><br />This is an adult movie in the same way that Family Guy is an adult TV show.  The main character is a snarky Teddy bear that has come to life, think Stewie.  The plot is fairly predictable and serves mostly as a vehicle to deliver the main characters into scenes that act as a set-up to the next joke for Ted.  The jokes tend toward the non-PC end of the spectrum.  These things are neither good or bad in their own right, but this is what the movie is.  If you like Stewie and Family Guy, you will probably like this movie; if you don't like that form of comedy, then this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />I do like Seth MacFarlane and the Stewie brand of comedy, but I think it is much better served in smaller time chunks like a half hour sitcom.  It gets a little old in a 2 hour movie.  I may have liked it better with a little sharper editing to get down to a 90 minute range rather than almost 120 minutes.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The best soap opera on television.  I was hooked after the 2nd episode of season 1.  Great acting, writing and direction.  It's like a good book, you just can't put it down.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|When I heard the plan to release 3 albums in 4 months, I had my doubts that the quality level could be sustained.  I was very happily surprised by this album.<br /><br />After 2 concept albums this marks the first album in 12 years that does not have a unifying underlying story.  As such, Green Day was able to use some great individual tracks that they had written during that time that didn't fit in with Idiot, Breakdown, or each other.  Even more impressive is the fact that they basically discarded 20 songs as being not good enough from the abandoned Cigarettes and Valentines album when they switched to the 3 album idea.<br /><br />Uno has several \\"anthem\\" type songs that will stick with you even after hearing them just once.  Let Yourself Go seems to be in the vein of Enemy as a pop punk staple.  Somehow I see this making its way into Final Four highlight packages....<br /><br />Highly enjoyable, whether this can be sustained through 2 more albums will remain to be seen, but this is a great start!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game super fun my girlfriend an  little brother love it for all ages but does lag a bit but still awesome
B00B52F278|5.0|I've been following Spartacus from the first season to the present. If you haven't seen the series and you aren't afraid of blood (lots of blood), violence (lots of violence), sex and nudity (male and female), carnage and mayhem you will enjoy this series. Spartacus and the gladiators the people of Rome and other countries and cities have a mission with a story. It was no fun and games, it was about survival, the right to live, and basic civil rights. Yes, even during this era there were issues about freedom, freedom of speech, abuses, starvation, slavery, and the list goes on.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Just finished \\"Steal Like An Artist\\" I am amazed by how simple and fascinating this book is.<br />If you are someone whos job is to create you have to read this book.<br />Thank you Mr @austinkleon
0765334798|4.0|This is the second Scalzi book that I have read.  The first was Fuzzy Nation which I enjoyed immensely.  This book was also very enjoyable; it was funny and clever.  Although I kind of wish it has ended before we got to the Codas.  Still it was an entertaining read.<br /><br />I read this on audiobook and really really enjoyed it. It's read by Will Wheaton, who does an excellent job reading audiobooks.<br /><br />In the future the Intrepid is the flagship of the Universal Union and it is an honor to be assigned to it.  So thinks Ensign Andrew Dahl until he starts to notice strange things...like the strange way the officers talk at times, like the high body count on away missions, and like how he does and says things he normally wouldn't on away missions....  When Dahl and his friends start looking into things more deeply they find that things on the Intrepid are very very wrong.<br /><br />This is a hard book to review without spoilers, but I will try my best.  Let's just say it's a very tongue in cheek type of funny story.  It's full of mystery, gorey sci-fi action scenes, strange coincidences, and a bit of time travel.<br /><br />The characters are all quirky and interesting.  Although this isn't a character driven story, they are there mainly to unravel the mystery of Intrepid.<br /><br />The whole craziness around time travel and predestined fates gets a bit confusing towards the end of the book, but Scalzi approaches it all with a sense of humor that makes it more believable.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I kind of wished the book would have stopped before it got to the Codas, I think they detracted from the story.  The three Codas basically tell the impact of the Intrepid's story on three characters that get involved from our time and world.  They were kind of interesting, but didn't add to the story a whole lot.<br /><br />In the end exactly how and why things happened how they did on the Intrepid was a bit ambiguous and confusing, but it was still pretty hilarious.<br /><br />Overall this was an entertaining read.  If you enjoy parodies and over-the-top humorous science fiction you will enjoy this book.  It was pretty hilarious and entertaining to read.  The story didn't always make complete sense and was a bit ambiguous at times, but Scalzi kind of makes fun of this so it works for this book.  Recommended if you are a fan of humorous sci-fi or if you are a fan of Scalzi's previous books.tty hilarious.<br /><br />Overall this was an entertaining read.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is so fun and addicting!  My friends told me about it and they love it too.  The game is exciting and you can also race with dragons that you've hatched, which is one of my favorite things about this game.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|When stuck in a 'life rut' there is only one book I turn to - 'Man's Searching for Meaning'.<br />I am happy to have this as a new e-book as my paper copy is now well and truly used!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|I love them because they work great around kids and when they get stuff on them they clean up easy
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|It's not bad. I don't like the controls. I waste more ammo trying to hit the aim button. I think it's annoying you can't lay is on something you have to hold it
0525478817|5.0|I am smitten. First book I couldn't put down in a long time. The insight is incredible. The writing is even better.<br /> John Green, who do YOU read?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST TEMPLE RUN EVER!!!!!!!!!<br />I dare you to get it and rate it I know you will rate it 5 stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoy the upstairs, downstairs lifes.  The clothing and picturesque countryside is wonderful too!  Bummer to have 2 deaths in one season.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this product is like temple rut but it is still a great game to play for a whole family
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I don't know where the negative criticism is coming from. I have seen every episode many times in the past. Watching this season 2 in bluray is like watching it new all over again. Rich, luscious colors and detail which were before, indistinguishable. Love it. Love it!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Loved loved this book. Twists and turns keep you guessing. Just when you think you know how it will end, it takes an immediate turn. Didn't want to put the book down
B004K58GSO|4.0|John Wayne plays the usual tough guy in this classic western, the genre which has never been the same since the likes of The Duke, and to a lesser degree Robert Mitchum, has never been matched! This follows The Duke as he demonstrates true character by maintaining his friendship over money. A very worthwhile film!!
B004DTXJ4S|3.0|I would like to start off by saying: I like bad action movies, and good ones too, but also bad ones. I have enjoyed the Resident Evil series, even though I love the video game and hate the way the movies distort the material, but this movie is about the limit of ability to follow along.<br /><br />The movie starts off as confusing, and quickly makes its way into the realm of &#34;come on!&#34; and &#34;what?! Seriously?&#34; Furthermore, all of the zombies, zombie &#34;captains&#34;, and even Wesker, seem to have been taken directly from RE5. However this is a good movie to watch with some people that like talking over movies, as there is little dialogue worth listening to.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie, but I did enjoy it in a certain fashion.<br /><br />Note: The HD quality of the movie itself was excellent. As always Amazon delivers a responsive, quick, and reliable system for enjoying media.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite Disney movies! My girls love it as well! :) :) :) :) :)
B004KKXMSI|5.0|Jurassic Park was one of the first movies that I remember watching in theaters, and it was amazing! This movie made me want to be a paleontologist for at least ten years.<br /><br />There are so many good things to be said about this movie, such as the animatronics and CGI, but it is difficult to put it to words. This is something that must be experienced.<br /><br />Note that movies 2 and 3 are in no way as epic as the first, but at this price is well worth getting the set.
B0017P520U|4.0|Good CGI.  Should still read the book but it help when not fully understanding the book.  Story has a lot of action.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Each character is well described you can picture them to a T. The storyline is captivating, so much so that I couldn't put the book down. Ms. Picoult's writing was so engrossing I became mentally removed from my current surroundings and immersed into Chris and Emily's world.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish and guessing all the way to the end.  If I had to sum it all up in one word I would say...WOW! It's the kind of story that stays with you, has a strong message and one you will not soon forget.
B000H4TX9I|4.0|Enjoyed, wish there would have been additional seasons made.  Never realized how many characters that are on shows that I enjoy now.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really liked this game. The only flaw is that it has some adds but I expected that. Still, it's a good game.
030758836X|4.0|Loved this book! I have encouraged quite a few friends and family members to pick it up. I couldn't put it down once I started it.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|temple run is the best game ever!!! i liked the first version better tho.<br />:(  this version has great graphics, but i dont like how i turns and stuff. I LOVE THAT IT'S FREE!!!!!!!!!

B001FVV2X2|4.0|I know Fringe is on SciHD now, and I've just seen a few episodes here and there but I think this is one of those shows you really need to start from the beginning to understand the whole story.  With the Prime Membership I'm able to watch all of these free streaming onto my TV through my Blu Ray player.  Obviously some episodes are better than others, but the characters are great and you can tell it's building up to something big.  But like anything, you have to be in the right mood.  And liking sci-fi helps
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|This is an excellent album.  If you liked the Joe Walsh that did Rocky Moutain Way, All night Long, Funk 49, etc, you'll like this Album.<br /><br />His playing, singing and songwriting is in top form. Amazing for a guy who has basically taken a 20 year nap.  Like Rip Van Winkle; Joe woke up and said, \\"I can still do this, and as good as ever!\\";  and he did.<br /><br />The only thing that has changed is that Joe has got himself sober, and he is quite candid about the Joys of just being straight, clean, a family man.  But he does it in a way that is not preachy; or condescending.  He is just writing about what is going on in his life now; and he wants to let everyone know that growing up and becoming a responsible, happily married adult can be a gas.<br /><br />He hasn't lost his sense of humor, he even wrote a whinsical song about his wife getting a fishbone stuck in her throat. Which was not a fun experience when it happened, I'm sure.  Still he found a way to joke about it.<br /><br />The whole album is really solid, good old Joe Walsh rock and roll, with a few mellow tunes thrown in to balance things out.  But he was always that way; even his earliest works mixed some really hard rock with some really heartfelt mellow songs.  So it's not like he's changed his old formula.<br /><br />But these are all new songs, it's not just re-writing the same old song slightly different. These songs stand on their own, There IS one song which is an obvious nod to Funk # 49, the rest of the songs are totally new inventions.<br /><br />And , like Neil Young, he is an old school Analog Man; he doesn't use much digital stuff; so it's all real music.  No Pro Tools to fix that one slightly off note, (I hate what Pro Tools has done to modern music; when you hear someone who is singing and never makes even the slightest of errors; the tempo never varies even the slightest; they sound like a machine, it just ain't real!)<br /><br />So, I am really enjoying this album, and I think it will be one of those albums I listen to over and over.  Can't ask for more than that!

0307948560|4.0|I have read the book and I like it. I think it is entertaining and funny. A lot of working moms will probably idetify themselves with the main character.
B000HEYVD6|5.0|I read fiction to relax and that is precisely why I enjoy David Baldacci's books. They are thought provoking at times, entertaining, and an easy read. Really like the characters in this book.

B0050R0XEG|5.0|Bought this for my teenage son and he loved it.  And I did too.  Just incredible how well-engineered this is, and how well it all fits together.  Sure it's hard to put together, but that is the whole point.  The finished product is just beautiful.  We were missing (or lost) one part and Lego sent us a replacement no questions asked.  Great stuff.
B0000524E5|4.0|I like this movie. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|My teenage son loved this, and worked at it just about non-stop until it was done.  It is intimidating (in a good way) to see all of the pieces in the bags, but that is the whole point.  Plus we were not missing a single piece.  The finished product is also quite awesome.  If you can't bear to pay the obscene after-market prices for the other Star Wars Lego, this is the piece for you.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|The Sound of Music is an awesome movie that you will want to watch over and over again. This makes it a must-own purchase for any movie fan who appreciates beautiful scenery, wonderful story, and amazing soundtrack that had an unprecedented commercial success and almost unsurpassable even by today's sales standards.<br /><br />This is the story of Maria, an adorable young woman who lives in a school for nuns but often finds herself overwhelmed by her love of music and life in general (given the beauty of the surrounding area, the hills, the river, that is quite easy to do). She gets assigned as a governess to the house of captain Von Trapp who lives with his 7 children. Captain Von Trapp (portrayed by Christopher Plummer) is a very disciplined man to the point of being militaristic with his children and his ways soon clash with the more loving and affectionate nature of Maria. The rest is....well, you know. And if you don't, then you should definitely watch it.<br /><br />Blu-ray treatment is one of the best I have seen. Lots of special features, interactive modes, extra features which will please any fan. I highly recommend it

B001AR4K8K|5.0|The Lost Boys and Fright Night are the great vampire movies of the 80s. The Lost Boys introduced vampires as gang of teenagers who drive motorbikes, wear leather jackets and act cool. This was a new concept that made it possible for future producers to come up with similar ideas (True Blood, The Twilight Saga, etc.). The Lost Boys is very unique for its style; it has a fantastic soundtrack containing rare gems of rock music from INXS and James Barnes, Tina Turner's saxophone player, and even a song written just for the movie by Lou Gramm (front man of legendary rock band Foreigner), and also cover version of The Doors' People Are Strange  mixed by Ray Manzarek of The Doors, again just for the movie and performed by Echo and the Bunnymen. All these great songs are heard throughout the movie at the right times and give the movie a special atmosphere that is not existent in any previous vampire movie before.<br /><br />The Lost Boys blu-ray (currently priced at $4.99) is a great bargain and a must-own for any serious fan of the vampire genre. The transfer is great and there are a lot fof special features:<br />-Commentary by director Joe Schumacher<br />-Additional/Deleted Scenes<br />-A Retrospective Documentary<br />-The Return of Sam and Frog Brothers-multi-angle video commentary<br />-Inside the vampire's cave: 4 featurettes<br />-Lou Gramm's \\"Lost in the Shadows\\" music video<br />-The undead creations of Gregg Cannom<br /><br />My only criticism for the movie is related to the plot. There is a turning point in the movie that is designed to throw the viewer off track about who the head-vampire is and it results in a inconsistency. I find that part of the movie illogical and unnecessary.
B004LWZW9C|4.0|I like this movie and the different stories it has. I think it is entertaining. I wanted to have this movie in dvd and add it to my collection.
030758836X|1.0|It had some intrigue at first but lost it along the way. I finished it only by skimming my way through.
6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead 2 is a good horror film with the comedy humor to it. Perfect film on DVD with Digitally Remastered with THX is really awesome, I loved watching movies on VHS and DVD with THX.
0525478817|5.0|I am in my fifties and read a variety of books. Dont think this book is limited to teens. The book did what I want a book to do. Get me hooked on the characters and what is happening in their lives so I want to keep turning the pages.  The writing is smart and clever. I will look for other books by this author.
B00005R24K|5.0|The Evil Dead is the most terrfying film to I watched on DVD, when I watched this film on DVD my body give me that chilling and burning sension, cool and scary special features.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I did notice 1 technical issue that I was able to recover from simply by watching that episode on Netflix. The issue was that no matter what time of day or the connection speed that I had on my Roku 2 of the episodes had no audio. Other than that everything was great and the series overall is absolutely outstanding.
B0037QGS0K|5.0|I have watched Chloe on the DVD verison, It's a great movie with drama, mystery, suspense and erotic I will be intrested on. good special features with BD+Live enabled on the WiFi enable for the Blu-Ray Disc Players or PlayStation 3 systems.
030758836X|2.0|I started this book with great anticipation--there was so much buzz about it. I'd heard that the writing was superb and I totally agree. Ms. Flynn has a flair for creating tension, intrigue, mystery and I was totally hooked on the story. No one's marriage is perfect and Amy and Nick fall into the trap of complacency when they move back to Nick's hometown to care for his ailing mother. Then, the unthinkable happens and Amy disappears--the apparent victim of a kidnapping or murder. The switching back and forth between Amy and Nick's POV with each chapter kept the suspense high. I couldn't wait to turn the page. That is, until the last third through to the ending which just didn't ring true for such a well-written novel. It was unrealistic and totally unbelievable. It's too bad the author chose to end the book this way because it made the rest of the story have so much less of an impact, at least for me. Can't recommend this one.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The screen bows out and actually popped off of the case. Not worth the money, I don't trust that it would really keep water out if it were submerged. Save your money, this product isn't worth it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I liked the first three books better, but still enjoyed 4&5. It is a series I will continue to read.

B00683JK9K|4.0|Saw the app 'Magic Puzzles:Seasons' in the app store listed as the &#34;app of the day&#34;.... My wife is an avid puzzle fanatic, and the app had a special discount price, so we did the download and install. My wife is absolutely in love with Magic Puzzles. The puzzles provided (even for the basic app) are inspiring. The smooth action for moving pieces and placing them properly make for a really enjoyable time.  There are plenty of options for the number of pieces, finding edges first, by color and more.  If you enjoy the art of assembling puzzles, you will really enjoy Magic Puzzles.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|No hesitation from me, this is a 5 star production all the way. The songs will get stuck in your head. His voice is amazing, better than ever. One of the most creative singer/songwriter talents of the last 50 years
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|At first, I really wasn't to keen about watching this movie. Actually I never heard the title before. But, thanks to Amazon Prime I was able to view the trailer for the movie. 'The Next Three Days' with Russell Crowe is excellent in every way. We were all riveted to our seats. The story line was spellbinding. The love is inspiring. The action barely gives you a chance to catch your breath. You may think you know what is going to happen..... but you're wrong.  We put this in the &#34;must see&#34; category.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This is a great quick read. It can be a little disturbing in some areas, so if you are sensitive to violence, this is not the book for you, but all in all, a great thriller.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the best series that there is. The characters above and below stairs are an interesting bunch. Julian Fellows has created a mostly believable household where not everyone keeps to his or her station. The story begins in the pre-WWI time period and currently takes place in the 20's. Interesting changes in mores and circumstances.
B0083EW97W|4.0|I am a John Mayer fan and I love this country like laid back style of this album. It is a little different from the John Mayer that most people know but for the price of around 5.00 for the mp3 album I love it. Take a listen and see if you like it for yourself for about the cost of cup of Starbucks coffee.<br /><br />If this review helped you please give it a thumbs up. Thank you.
1426209584|5.0|This book is amazing.  The photography is fantastic, there are lots of pictures of the birds.  All taken in the field, showing courtship behavior, some even showing the females and their response.  The story behind the photos is even more amazing.  The text makes fascinating reading, the number of hours spend waiting in blinds for a particular bird to show up at a site.  The years it took to cover ALL the birds of paradise.  I really like the map of islands and synopsis info on each species at the end of the book showing where is species is found and at what elevation.  This is one of the best books I have ever bought and the price was really reasonable, especially considering all the photography in the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a very good game. It can get you addicted after the fist time you play it. You should download it right now and start playing. It's fun trust me.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love this game and how you can have up to three different players, so my kids aren't beating a level before I get a change, and the bonus OCD are really hard, but fun!  The only bad thing is I can lose track of time, when I think I have played for 20 minutes, 2 hours have went by!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A great tool  maybe the best . I use it all time,better than my old one. What else can I say?
B0095P31L6|5.0|Didn't know what to expect.  I loved it.  Very clever writing. Computer animation is first rate--realistic, not cartoonish. Voices are perfect.<br />Adults will enjoy more than kids, which is a very good thing.  I've sat through multiple viewings already.
B005BDZN62|5.0|This is a great redone movie and a story you can watch over and over, mainly because of the songs.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|A favorite author once said that authors tend to be either plot driven or character driven. This book is both a great story and includes compelling characters. Pat has been discharged in his mothers care from a mental hospital after two years. He has no memory of the amount of time in the \\"bad place\\" and we wonder why his speech is immature for an adult. We only know he is an adult because  his focus is to get his wife back. He exercises compulsively to loose weight to achieve that goal.<br />His relationship with his father is awkward at best. His father doesn't even acknowledge his presence for the first few days. Dad has OCD and is fixated on his football team, the Eagles. The mother is nurturing and is always on the verge of tears as she fights to have her son and husband connect and more importantly have her son recover. Pat meets Tiffany a widow his age who has her own mental baggage. Their connection becomes a romantic center to the story. His relationship with Dr. Patel, his psychiatrist adds another very positive dimension to this book.<br />This is a different story than the movie. Both good in their own way but the book is particularly satisfying.
0525478817|4.0|'The Fault in Our Stars' has not made it onto many Young Adult 'must read' lists for no reason. It's well-written and Green provides a compelling, emotional story. While this novel deals with rather 'heavy' subject matter, it is presented in a way that teens can handle. The protagonist (Hazel) is relatable to many teens, not only because of her age. Obvious parallels can be drawn between readers who have or have been effected by serious illnesses. However, many teens who have not been effected by cancer can connect with her as well. While there are scenes depicting sexuality, they are mild enough for most teens to read. I would recommend this novel for those in  high school. Many students in 7th or 8th grade would be able to handle this novel and I am confident that the reading level is appropriate for middle school. However, some students may not appreciate or understand much of what is happening in Hazel's head.<br /> Green's novel could be used as a vehicle to teach most of the goals in the new Common Core. 'The Fault in Our Stars' could be incorporated into a unit about dynamic characters, questioning society, and many others. It would be interesting to plan a cross-curricular lesson with a science/biology teacher for this novel. Students could use the novel as a nonfiction reference while learning about different kinds of cancer.<br /> 'The Fault in Our Stars' is a quick read and most young students would find it interesting. It has contemporary allusions that may help students connect to the material. It also contains multiple themes that are fairly universal (young love, loss/death) and it provides small moments for cross-curricular connections (biology, social studies). The main drawback for this text would be the emotional weight of the story. The cancer and loss could be a a connector for many students, but it would not be far fetched for a student to be 'too emotional' and become uncomfortable reading (of course, pushing boundaries of comfort can be goodwithin reason). You could meet some resistance as this book is fairly new, it is at an easier reading level (although it deals with difficult subject matter), and it's not part of an established canon.<br /> Overall, I think this would be a wonderful book to teach with upper levels of Junior High and lower levels of High School.

I actually was embarrased to be seen reading the book, and I'm NOT a prude.  Ok, so a few sex scenes here and there, but sex is all that this book is all about. Enough already...give me a break...anyhow, I couldn't even finish the 1st book...also, some words repeated too many times. NOT a good book, from the literary stand point, UGH!!

It is written very clearly and is gripping.<br /><br />There are many reasons why this book has to be read.<br /><br />There many issues surrounding the treatment of black people that are brought out in the book. Apart from segregation in day to day life, such as segregation in hospitals we read about the attitudes to black people that sustained this segregation.  But we also read about the use of black people as scapegoats for research with often horrible consequences for individuals, which they were unaware of, and when they knew about it, had no/limited access to correcting the situations. For the reader today this should bring back memories of practices reported in the news, about the use of disabled, or black or minority people, soldiers  or other such groups for research  as they were either lacking in knowledge or because they were controlled by others. While ethics of research today have moved on, the need for all of us to be vigil is clear.<br /><br />Ethics of research is now much better controlled to protect the rights of the individuals. But the books makes it clear that such vigilance is crucial bearing in mind the vast strides in science and with focuses such as  our genes and the DNA becoming vital. We all fact the dilemma, for instance when we go to hospital for treatment, as to whether we should agree to let the medics use our parts for research- which should help all human beings in the future- or whether we should focus on our own individual rights.<br /><br />A very interesting aspect of the lives of black people in the United States is brought out in the book. The importance of kinship is remarkable.  No child would ever be left unsupported or isolated. It could be siblings, grandparents, or even cousins who would without any question be brought in to provide care and support. This is a very positive aspect, often neglected in literature.<br /><br />Some readers have not found the book easy to follow. Often the book feels like a catalogue of scientific  details, rather than a life history of Henrietta lacks. Perhaps the appeal of the book may have been greater if the author had not tried to include every detail of the information she collected during her research.<br />Sometimes the technical data is too complicated for the ordinary reader. However, medical students will find it very  revealing.<br /><br />In many ways what happened to Henrietta Lacks and her cancer cells should not surprise us if we remind ourselves of the context of racial issues in the United States. But it also reminds us that it is important for us to revisit the past as it makes us more knowledgeable, and more responsible for the future. History is sometimes seen as just a glorification of the past,  or an imbalanced view of the past, or even not of any value today. But this book shows  us that history is about everything , that we need to keep on searching the past, and that our inquiring minds are more developed as we do so.

0765325950|4.0|There are many reviews more worthy than mine, but I enjoyed the final book of the Wheel of Time Series.  I started reading this series in the 90's and it's conclusion is as epic as I had hoped.  Brandon Sanderson has done a great job picking up Robert Jordan's story and seeing it through to conclusion.  This final book gathered nearly all the stray plot lines and pulled them together into a final satisfying battle.  Bravo Sanderson, Jordan would be proud.

B002CNKRTM|4.0|The product was exactly like it was described, I just didn't like the read very much.  I used to be into WWII stuff, but this was pretty dry, and you better know your pre WWI history and your history between WWI and WWII or you won't know what he's talking about.  There are some things that made no sense to me even though I do know my history, but there were a few things that he was dead on when he was predicting the future of Europe and expecially the future of America.
